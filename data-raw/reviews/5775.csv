"atperratore","2007-06-23T15:17:38.077Z","Great, but some little problems","i picked this set up from toys r us yesterday, and i was really pleased with it...

the instructions are a bit weird, as they jump around a lot, but pretty soon i had this stunning set sitting on the floor in front of me.

The rocket: the rocket has a nice, sleek design, with a good color scheme.
Pros:
(its cool
(interesting &quot;engine&quot; behind cockpit
(martains dont slide out of containment chambers, as there is a blocking piece
(stores jetpack
Cons:
(pilot has to lie down
(only seats one person
(weird rod sticking out of bottom for... display?

The base:
a very nice base. the pump system works well, everything fits well, much better than the last one. comes with enough figures for play. the pump gun also works surprisingly well.
Pros:
(Pump system is soooo addicting must pump more must pump pump...
(cool figs with gold visors
(nice lab
(great playability
Cons:
(could have had more rooms
(lab on top should be enclosed
(costs about $10 too much

if you are a mars fan, this set is a must!

"Hewkii1992","2007-10-14T15:51:25.077Z",":)","The MB01 is quite a fun set.  It is, however, very open and could be improved greatly.  The pumping mechanism is improved over the Life on Mars Aero Tube Hangar, which is a plus.  There are many details in this set, especially on the Shuttle.  Many believe that the cockpit on the shuttle is capable of seating one pilot, but in reality, you may seat two.  The shuttle features an &quot;emergency&quot; eject feature, in which you may break the cockpit off from the rest of the ship.  The alien craft is also greatly detailed, and fun to play around with.  The wings are far two floppy, though.  Another pro is that the base comes with plenty of astronauts, and aliens.  The base may be modified so that it is more playable (I fitted my base with several &quot;modules&quot; using the BIONICLE Toa Mahri canisters).  The handle beneath the shuttle is a handle to hold it more properly, making it very swooshable.  The handle is also very sturdy.  The lab is interesting, and is very detailed.  I do not mind its openess.  The center of the base may be fitted with an Astro Fighter.  The foam missiles can be shot very far.  The shuttle is also very large...

"sudorum","2008-06-01T21:10:03.14Z","The little green men would be proud","THis is the best mars mission set by a long shot. You don't even have to get the other mars mission sets to enjoy this one. THe air pump system is great and can actually pump alien pods or armless minifigs through the system into the orange tubes. There's an alien analyzing pod and clasping stretcher on the top of the base THe orange and white rocket has some sort of technic handle on the bottom of the ship and I would suspect its for grasping when you swoop the plane around, pretty ingenious, actually.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-06-07T18:30:42.45Z","Mars Mission's current base","This set was released yesteryear (2007), as a part of the Mars mission theme collection. Like all mars mission sets, this features the repetitive white, orange, blue and few black details for the humans' vehicles, and the green and black, but also few red details for the aliens' vehicles. This base at the first view seems to be well made, and really is, it don't dismantle very easily when playing.

This set includes 4 astronauts minifigures and 4 alien minifigures. 

The aliens don't have the original Lego shape, these aren't very good liike the insectoids or UFO alien minifigs, because they can't move the arms or head, just the legs, and are smaller than the other Lego minifigures. Not only with these mistakes, the alien minifigures are covered completely by a green color with glow in the dark effect. The color and effect are good, but unnecessary for minifigures, and for minifigures without the common shape, it is worst, these alien minifigures looks like weird, because aren't useful (the arms cannot move, are glued to the body and cannot hang weapons in a good position) and don't moves very well (only the legs).

The astronauts are much better than the alien minifigures, first because these have the original Lego shape, and also because the astronauts features a decent color scheme. The astronauts are white with details on the central piece in the front and back, and these, altough well made, aren't like the old astronauts' simple and classic details, the new colors are repetitive, not weird like the new aliens, but really repetitive. The astronauts features also different faces and a white color of the helmet, increased by a gold visor. This is a good color, but for visors, a translucent blue, green, red or orange is even better. Unlike the aliens, the astronauts can hang tools and weapons. Overall, useful minifigures but with repetitive details and color schemes.

The base is well made, the building consists in some white bricks on the first floor, and keep the second floor stable, it don't dismantle easily. On each side of the base there are some technic pieces increasing the bricks of the first floor, and these are also keeping the second and third floors kept from dismantling. At the second floor, in the front of the base, a place to the astronaut sit can be seen, and there are more white bricks on each side, increasing it and also, two stickers at two small plates features two control panels. In the left side, there is an elevated part that is another chair for an astronaut, and in the front of this, there is another &quot;control panel&quot;, and in the front there are the foam missiles, these can be launched easily, and are really big in comparison with a minifigure. Under this part, and under the second floor, there are some orange tubes, that can take the &quot;captured&quot; aliens to the capsules, using the pump air system. The pump air system can transfer the aliens and at the same time shoot the foam missiles, by a piece located in the first floor, but can be putted in a distance to the base. Itt is just a piece, without any increasement.

More bricks and technic pieces are on the other side of the base's second floor, keeping it in feet, and this part have the end of the pump air systems, the capsules where the &quot;captured aliens stay. In some holes of the system (not in the tubes, but in the floor), the alien can be putted and after, can be transfered to these capsules. In the main part of the base, there are some pilars making the third floor still in feet, and between the pilars of the second floor, there are some plates and bricks, making a passage, covered by two translucent orange pieces, and it is also behind the capsules. 

Finally, the third floor. This is kept in feet due to the much technic pieces on each floor, unnecessary to a space base, and really, not useful as it could be, isn't right for a space theme, this base have so much unoccupied places and holes in the floors, without some plates to increase. So, the third floor is maybe the more increased (with more space to put the miniigures). In the front of the third floor, there are more translucent orange pieces increasing it, and also small blue pieces. The main pieces of this floor are the black plates, and above, there is a capsule with &quot;mechanic arms&quot; to torture the alien (I don't know what the astronauts make with  the alien there, maybe is it), and some other pieces increasing, like the orange hoses. In the left side of this floor, there is a white long brick, with a satellite made by white and blue technic and secial pieces. About the base, the playability isn't very good, altough it don't dismantle easily, and have very things to make(launch the missiles and transfer crystals or aliens), the playability with the minifigures isn't very good, because the tubes and technic pieces upset the playability with minifigs, occupy so much space to it.

The set also have two spaceships, the poor alien spaceship and the massive but not very well made astronaut spaceship.

The astronaut's spaceship is just big for a minifigure, but is simple and features unnecessary &quot;special pieces&quot; to it. Some plates and bricks makes the base of the spaceship, and also keep it well fitted. The playability, so, is good, but the pieces don't have a good size, each to other. because some &quot;special pieces&quot; (pieces featuring semi circular shape, without likeness of bricks, with the goal to make the set more reallistic, but it sometimes affect to make creations, because are really unproportional with bricks), are much bigger in comparison with some other bricks. The wings are simple in the details, altough are complete in size and in shape. The spaceship is at all, very nice, but some flaws, like the cockpit (it is just a combination of two solid translucent orange pieces, don't show much creativity) and the two long orange tubes, unnecessary. Also, the spaceship have two capsules for aliens, quitte odd and unnecessary, and this have no shooting weapons like the new flick missiles of the star wars, or the &quot;cannons&quot; of some of the exo force sets. Also, the pilot stay on the front, not sitted, but strechted out, looking for up, and not for the front. Altough the spaceship have a nice design at the first view, the pieces aren't quite useful at all, making it with some odd details (at least unnecessary). The astronaut's spaceship stay fitted in the base, prepared to launch. It is hard to dismantle easily, and stay there very well, is too playable. But some notable mistakes are the lots of stickers, the repetitive color scheme and the no much creative building of the spaceship's &quot;chassis&quot;, it also could have landing gears.

And finally, the alien's spaceship. Like all the other spaceships, the spaceship included with this set is at the first view incomplete, and features also a poor building, with so much special pieces (unnecessary pieces without likeness of bricks or regular pieces and plates) and with a so much small size, it is really small in comparison with other human spaceships (the alien spaceships of the Mars Mission are ever minor than the human spaceships, unproportional), or with old alien spaceships (insectoids and UFO's flying saucers). The building consists in semi triangular plates to support the alien (the alien stay fitted in the spaceship with the feet), and the &quot;wings&quot; or just flaps of each side, can moves, but aren't complete, there are many spaces remainning for more increasements. Also, this spaceship have only translucent green pieces to looks like with weapons, but shot nothing. The color scheme is repetitive, just green and black, and the stickers are so much. The cockpit is so simple and no really well made. Overall, this spaceship is poor, but could be even better with more size and increasements (also, could be better without the alien minifigs).

Overall, this set is good to any new Lego fan or to new space fans (The old space sets were uncomparable in creativity, the new don't show much). A good set, with some pros (like the design, some parts of the astronauts spaceship's buildings, playability with the spaceship and air pump), but have noteble cons (repetitive color scheme, lots of stickers, the weird alien minifigures, incomplete alien's spaceship, so much &quot;special pieces&quot; and unnecessary price). The price isn't very good for it (don't have much pieces like the awesome set 10190, and this with minus is muvh more expensive, don't worth money really) but if you can buy this and you search for some Mars mission stuff, it is the option, altough there are many other sets better, not from Mars mission. At all, this gets a 3,7 of 5. Good, could be better. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-12-13T13:17:05.187Z","Aero Tube Hanger Mk 2","Oh no.  The vacuum cleaner space-station is back.  Alright, so it's at least a nicer colour than that hideous, clunky Life On Mars Aero Tube set, but it has all the same problems.  Namely an over-reliance on gimmicks rather than useful pieces, it's all very skimpy-looking and there are far too many big, over-simplified pieces.  The shuttle is okay, would have been better on its own, but if Lego keep releasing this kind of rubbish then Space is never going to make a come-back.

"kerfal","2008-12-05T04:49:21.077Z","Good set for playing, but not really pretty","When I received this set, I was so excited because it was the last of 2007 mars mission set for me to buy (at last!). But when opening the box I was a bit disappointed to see the mess. The instructions where all torn, because they are not separated from the parts any more (I miss the old fashion boxes where you could see the best parts and mini-fig without opening it).

I construct it quite fast regarding the number of pieces. 
I just love the spaceship with it vertical landing. It's really a play-oriented set where you can pump to throw missile or handle the spaceship by the back (handy, but ugly).

But at the end I was surprised to stay with 4 part that weren't on the instructions (I check 4 time). It's part 4185652 (x1) and part 366623 (x3). They are referenced at the end of the instruction, though.

Anyone have noticed it?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"rnychka","2009-01-04T12:43:20.547Z","Fun, but is it LEGO?","Well, I loved the concept of sucking the alien out of the ship and then transporting it in the air tubes to the dissection table.  Kinda grim actually, but the story line imagination play here is great.

I generally don't like oversized pieces since they are hard to store and damage easily, and this one has quite a few.  This set really makes it hard to discuss the downside with my kids regarding the megablocks philosophy of fewer pieces that are specialized.  

It stays together fairly well, and the play time is great with it, but for me LEGO is for imagination building and other than the ship, it is really a boring build.

Pros to me:
- great play concept
- ship is very cool, but why does the minifig need to lay down?
- dissection table is cool
- illustrates the concept of suction and pressure really well

Cons:
- missiles do not work very well
- too many large pieces

"Kapoka79","2008-07-12T00:08:24.36Z","Pretty Sweet!","I got this set for Christmas and built it right away after getting over the excitement.

Pros

Comes with 4 human and 4 alien mini figs.
Comes with cool alien ship.
Has a human shuttle that can hold a jetpack and has those orange canisters.
Nice and Sturdy.
The tubes that shoot aliens everywhere are pretty cool and actually work quite well.
There is a little lift that can bring an alien up to the experiment lab.
The gun turret also works pretty well for just working with air.

Cons

Too many stickers no pre-painted parts to this set.
Aliens can't move their arms so it's hard playing with them.
The experiment lab is a little too small. 
Below the experiment the experiment lab is a little shaft that runs to the back of the base and it has no purpose at all.
The wings on the space shuttle can sometimes break off real easily.

"andy87","2008-12-02T15:03:51.67Z","Cool but not extremly huge","I've noticed the sets with pump systems (this, the mothership) are pretty expensive, but pump systems work pretty well. It transports alien pretty well but kinda slowley. The missles can't actually be fired very far because they are made out of foam, and the base isn't actually that big for what you pay.

-You could build more modules at the base!
-Many humans and aliens (2 in pods).
-The pump system add playability to the set.

cons:

"saber755","2009-03-31T13:42:13.763Z","man the torpedoes captain, shoot that ufo down!","the set is amazing in itself! their is simply no end to the fun.
the pump system works great although i do not know why they only had 4 rubber bands instead of 8, although it is still amazing.
you can switch from blow to suck, so you can transport the aliens everywhere.
the missiles only shoot up to 2 1/2 feet at most, but that doesn't bother me.
the base has a experiment lab with an elevator that can lift aliens from the right tube into the lab, from their it goes on the ex-ray table (powered by a crystal), and finally it goes to the disection table where it is held down with 4 straps and disected (when i play with it i use the included chainsaw }:), more on that later).
the base itself is basically 3 floors(although if modified may easily be made into 4), the first consists of minor skeletal raftor like beams.
the second consists of a fairly small walkway with a door.
the third and final floor consists of an elevator,
an experimentation lab, a raftor that the alien storage cell can slide across, and a radar dish.
their is a seat to control the missile launcher, and another to control the aero tube chamber.
the rocket-ship consists of an engine, neat folding wings, a storage compartment, and an ejecting cockpit.
the alien ship is pretty basic, with slight foldable wings.
overall it has 4 nonused gems, a chainsaw, binaculars, a jackhammer, a metal detector, a rocket ship, a ufo, a command base, 4 foam missiles, 4 astronaughts, 4 aliens, and a pump system.

pros:

air system works great.
rocket-ship has ejecting cockpit.
astronaughts have very nice faces.
pump system is adictive.
lots of minifigs.
detailed experiment lab.
nice radar dish.
storage tank for alien.
tubes can attach to most vehicles.
rocket-ship has a nice handle.
ufo is very detailed.
missile launcher has a neat swivling barrel.
and tubes unexpectadly don't scratch alot.

cons:

my 4 aliens didn't glow in the dark, even though the box said they did.
air pump came scratched.
alien ships wings are floppy.
could have used 4 more rubber bands.

overall 4.5/5 because the only cons that bothered me are the non glow in the dark aliens and not enough rubber bands.
any-ways it's a great buy if your a fan of fun.
good luck getting it and good day.
