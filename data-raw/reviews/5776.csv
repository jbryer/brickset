"dragon_teenager","2007-11-04T22:42:45.217Z","Not as fun to play with as it is to stare at","It's massive, and it splits into four smaller air vehicles. But it doesn't do this gracefully.


~PROS~

- The mothership just generally looks awesome.

- Awesome details like the lime green tentacles make it look really alien. Props to the designers.

- As mentioned, it splits into four smaller vehicles. Cool idea.

- The missile turret looks cool, and there's a little mining platform attached to it. Neat.


~CONS~ 

- The turrets on the top of the mothership are possibly the worst design for a turret that I have ever seen. They're mounted on swivel bricks, but the designers tried to fix how they spun around freely by adding bricks to prevent them from swiveling anywhere but towards each other. I would have taken those off.

- The aliens don't stick to the bottom of the two smaller ships on the Mothership's sides... at all. I had to leave them off.

- Maybe I build something wrong, but as far as I can tell, the missile turret is incapable of propelling the missiles more than four inches.

- The wings on the front of the Mothership aren't locked into place. They swing around, a little.

- There is no landing gear to speak of. 


Overall: 3.8/5


The set wildly varies. I wouldn't bother with it unless you want more alien ships or the pieces, the latter of which is the best use for this set. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-05-31T20:52:29.093Z"," so-so","THis ship has a few problems. firstly, I still haven't gotten the hang of the air pummp system and due to the fact the missles are foam they don't fire very far. The name of the ship suggested that it should have had some form of an inside but it doesn't! The box i got didn't have a decal page included(i don't know if a ship with decals or a ship without decals, making the ship incomplete ,is worse) I wouldn't put this on my top priority list but buy it if you can spare some money.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"uberpuma1","2008-07-05T12:44:18.403Z","Mothership?","My set was missing part #43719 therefore I never finished building this model. HOWEVER, I did get far enough along that I can review several aspects of it.

It seems very fragile. If this ship were hanging in a posed position, it would be pretty cool. However, it isnt. This gun turrets arent very stable and the nose of the ship is in my opinion excess.. I think this set would have been better to reinforce the belly of the ship, and leave off the curved front part. Its hard to figure out what they were going for here. Perhaps a drop ship, but it simply isnt big enough, or maybe a bomber... but still not enough... I would think that an alien mothership would be much more like we have seen on independance day, or star wars, or ... you know a MOTHER ship. this looks like a stealth recon ship that is on sterioids.

However...

Lots of awesome black curved parts for building engines like on the Star Wars Rogue Shadow #7672.  I still havent found an alternate use for the rotary gun, but I will. I think this set is great for younger people, however... it just doesnt work for me.. If they had used dkgrey instead of lime green, it would have been a major improvement. Also if they had used technic tubing rather than the wormy bionicle things, it would have been better.

All in all... I give it a 3 It isnt a mothership... They even had to package it with a white canon that looks like it is mounted on a raceboat to market it at 50.00USD. Im sure this set is very playable, but the creativity factor and style factor along with the actual structure factor bring this one way down.

Pros:
Parts, lots of black cool parts

Cons:
Not a mothership.. in fact, it has Identity issues and has no idea what it is.
(motherships dont have external gunners, this thing should have been a battleship)
Is there such a thing as a Mothership Assault?  really?

"Kapoka79","2008-07-13T16:56:52.34Z","Okay ","First of all I'm going to say that it's really big. The alien mothership might even be bigger than the Eagle 01 Command Base. So make room for it if you get this lego set.

Pros

Welll priced.
5 cool glow in the dark alien and two human minifigures.
Alien ship splits up into 4 cooler and smaller space ships.
Alien ship can shoot out a little missile.
The ship has green tentacle thingys on it that add great detail.
Easy to hold because of a nice grip piece on the bottom of it.
Many laser and guns on the ship.
The turret shoots out little hard foam bullets. (Alsmost like Nerf bullets.)
It shoots pretty well for being pumped by just air.

Cons

A little too big.
Mothership doesn't look as cool as I thought it would.
Don't know why they put a little mining station on the side of the human turret.
It's not all that fun to play with for some weird reason.
Stickers (Of Course!)

Overall it's pretty good but could use just a little work on it. But I say it would be worth getting in the end.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"P13c30fch33s3","2008-12-16T01:06:38.06Z","Brilliant, but worth it?","just a note to dragon_teenager, slam the air pump REALLY hard. if it doesn't shoot further than a foot, either:
you have a defective toy or
(more likely) you are not hitting hard enough.

Anyway, the mothership looks really cool, until you see the centre of it. It looks empty and useless. Theturrets have a useless design.
The alien 'vipers' hardly stick to the alien with blu-tack, sticky tape etc

Pros:
looks cool
lots of alien ships
good contest
turret
drill on turret
rockets

Cons:
Mothership has rather bad frame.
vipers are designed really badly
hard to stand
'dragon cruiser's' wings are floppy
hurts your hand to fire really far.

all in all, good, but don't start with it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-29T19:14:33.903Z","Looks like a draw","This set is pretty good, but it has some problems and gets boring quickly. I cannot decide who would win here because the mothership is powerful and the launcher looks like it can destroy it in one hit.

The air-powered rocket launcher is one of the parts I got this for. It can sort of far when you slam it, but if you stomp it, it goes very far. The launcher can aim only up and down, which was disappointing because, I could probably think up a way to make it turn. The ""power plant"" is HUGE! If you get this in the box, you will notice how thick it is. That is because the pump(I just call it that) is fit in there longways.

The mothership is cool, but like the launcher, it has some problems. First of all, the main part I like the most because, the design is very complicated and fun to build . I think the tail fins are a cool idea. The turrets are not that move-able due to two studs on each side blocking them. The small ""hang gliders"" are boring by themselves, but with an astro fighter, their fun. The front cockpit that can separate is okay, but the ""wings"" droop.

pros:
Rocket launcher fires fairly far.
HUGE pump.
Gunner's face.
Mothership detaches three vehicles.
Many ""tentacles""
Cool design.
Blunt launcher

cons:
Rocket launcher does not turn.
Gets boring quickly.
""Wings"" on cockpit droop.
""Hang gliders"" are useless.

I was just thinking of bringing up the rating to five, but getting boring quickly is a big problem for me. It is okay, but I recommend the Recon dropship more.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Sobel","2016-05-10T12:26:39.467Z","The air-pump-cannon outplays the alien ship!","<p>As the title states, the air-pump-cannon is the better part of the set, in my opinion. The ship looks interesting, but its design is somehow... awkward and random... It has some interesting functions, as all Mars Mission sets, but, unfortunately, these pros are spoiled by a lot of major cons, which I will state below.<br />
Is it worth the money? Well, I paid 15&euro; via Ebay, which is OK. Don&#39;t spend more than 20&euro;/22$ on it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots and lots of dark and&nbsp;green UFO-discus and tentacle parts. Trans-neon blasters all the way. Nothing we don&#39;t know from this series and nothing that could be combined with other series quite well... The base of the ship is made of LEGO Technic parts, which I personally favour, for it gives the structure hold. Oh, and it has a spring-loaded shooter, which is always good.<br />
The air-pump-cannon is a cool invention, maybe the best part of the whole set!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two astronauts with cool faces, five stupid aliens. These green, immobile, useless pieces are the biggest mistake ever made in the history of LEGO Space themed sets. Fullstop.<br />
Oh and, if this is the alien mothership, WHY IS THERE NO ALIEN COMMANDER???</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not too challenging, yet interesting to see how everything is brought together. The air-pump-system is installed easily, but you have to bee careful not to apply too much pressure on the hose when installing it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The astronaut drill-cannon-base is not too much to look at, but really fun to play with! As a 30-yo adult, I couldn&#39;t help shooting these blue foam-arrows all over our living-room, until my wife stopped me! ;-) My 4-yo daughter also had great fun with it!<br />
The alien ship is basically only a medium-sized platform for the spring-loaded shooter. To the front is a detachable cockpit, which looks quite cool. The back has black and green fins without any practical use, but to look stylish.<br />
Now, the major flaws! There are two gun turrets mounted on the central platform. Each is manned with one of those skinny alien-figures. But the most ridiculous thing is: HANDLEBARS!!! The turrets have handlebars!!! What for????? These fully-handicapped morons can&#39;t even extend their arms! What do they need handlebars for??? Until this I could have imagined some kind of mind-control over their vehicles, but now... handlebars... Not only does it make no sense, it looks completely weird.<br />
Second major flaw: to the side of the main section are two more gun turrets. These can also be detached. OK so far? Good. But wait, what??? Why are there two of those useless green guys impaled on the lower part of it? Dunno, maybe they are meant to engineer it, or their life power is sapped to power the gun, who knows? *insert Giorgio Tsoukalos* &quot;Aliens&quot;.<br />
These two points really crack me up. Furthermore, the whole ship is quite awkward to hold in hands. You can hold it like a gun with the stand on the lower side (you can&#39;t see it on the picture, it looks really out of place when finished...), but if you want to set it down, you have to be careful not ot accidentally trigger the gun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While the secondary part, the astronaut-part, is pretty good, the alien ship has hardly more than a cool look to it, in my opinion. It has a spring-loaded gun, which is nice, and some detachable parts, but nothing more. The most downgrading point are, like always with this series, the poorly and loveless-designed aliens. They are put in awkward and useless places which gives the model a somewhat unfinished look.<br />
I&#39;m a collector, so to complete the series, I bought it. But there are WAY better LEGO sets out there.</p>

"exorallan31","2022-09-20T18:23:50.553Z","Very fun set.","<p>For figures we get 5 aliens and 2 astronauts. these are very simple figures, aliens soulless, astronauts have nice torsos and a gold visor but otherwise not much special.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Putting the set together was not my favourite experience as it has a lot of technic stuff. just my opinion however.</p>

<p>There is some fun parts here. Trans neon green radars, a big air pump thing and some tubes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the models we have a big turret installation thing and the main mothership.</p>

<p>The big turret thing is massive because of the big air pump. there&#39;s a little slide thing on the side. The airpump can fire essentially nerf bullets and the function.. it works alright. the big air pump and tubes are some very expensive pieces that bumped up the retail price a lot i think.</p>

<p>The main mothership i really like. technic cannon in the middle which work great, the green and black matches together perfectly.</p>

<p>But the main function is that it splits into multiple sections, the main reason why it&#39;s called a mothership. The front part looks very nice, the little drone things are very wobbly when connected to the main ship but look fun. and some little speeder things. adds a lot of play value.</p>

<p>For the original retail price the PPP Is slightly on the higher side due to the big pump but there is a lot of play value so it&#39;s not all bad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So overall would i reccomend this set? it&#39;s very expensive now but if you can get a good deal i would reccomend getting it.&nbsp;</p>
