"Huw","2007-06-20T18:14:12.623Z","The best of the Mars Mission sets","In the time-honoured fashion, which seems to have become a standard format for brickset reviews, here are the pros and cons of this set:

Pros:
- Cool, fresh-looking colour scheme
- Dropship is very swooshable and a decent size
- Alien ship is an interesting design and shape

Cons:
- The aliens are absoulte rubbish and very disappointing when compared to the earlier Life On Mars aliens.
- The alien canister thigys on the drop-ship look stupid and out of place. I took them off right away.
- The drilling vehicle is reasonable, and fits underneath the drop ship by way of the clever use of rubber parts.
- The dropship cockpit 'flaps about in the wind' due to the use of the new ball-joint pieces. I replaced mine with a click version (as used for Exo-Force legs) to prevent it moving from side-to-side.

The score would have been 4 if the aliens had been better. Nevertheless if you like futuristic themes, I can recommend you get this set.

"omgbrick","2007-06-27T11:28:29.39Z","MX-71 recon Dropship"," I got this a few set a few days ago so heres my thoughts on the set. The dropship it self looks very good even though those canisters do look a bit strange on the dropship they do help it not look so empty, which I find makes it look very weaknear the end of it since it's pretty much just a bar with a tail fin attached with engines. the little vechile it comes with is somewhat pointless andthe orange wheels won't work for many other vecicles. The cock pit is nice and i'm fine with it being able to move arond and it's nice and roomythe landing gear looks awsome and very heavy duty the wings look great and another shooter piece is alaways good. I hate the aliens and there ship as the can't hold anything in there hands the alien ship looks incomplete mostly due to having NO ENGINE. Finally theres stickers.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Bran_don_jin","2007-07-10T17:12:50.497Z","Good set.","    This is my first Mars Mission Lego set... it wil not be my last though...
     The Human figs are nice, they come with cool outfits and golden visors.
     The aliens (as everyone else has said) are a complete dissapointment. They cant move their arms which makes them basicly incapable of carrying most weapons.
     The alien ship has nice weapons systems and is very swooshable. There is however no windshield and no proper way to land. (But maybe the aliens can breath Mars' atmosphere and the ship can float while landed)
     The little mining vehicle is nice but a bit boring. I'm probably going to swich the drill with a gun.
     The MX-71 Recon Gunship (The highlight of the set) reminds me of the Pelican gunship from Halo because of their similair desighs. The ship has tons of weapons and it looks like it could do a great deal of damage. The landing gear is very nicely detailed and so is the rotating cockpit. 
     All-in-all good set, it seems as if it would be 50$ not 40$ but I'm not complaining. This set does come with stickers that are pretty hard to put on but I guess we're all going to have to get used to stickers now aren't we?
     Good set 4.5/5

"Legonater","2007-07-22T15:02:53.217Z","COOL","I've a few arguments befre I continue...
1. First of all, the Martians aren't rubish, they're plastic! Ok, there arms may not be able to move, but they CAN hold on to things and they are still useful!
2. I don't see the problem with the dropship. although I don't have it (YET) I can't see what's wrong with the alien pods and the cockpit. You're problems sound quite odd.
3. The Martian ship is the same as the dropship, what's the problem? Of course Matians can breathe thrie own air, it's their planet! and I the landing gear sitauation, who cares?
4. The driller is not useless. My guess is like the driller with the strike ship, the drill can be raised. Use THAT as a weopon!

All in all, Those are my thought on those arguments. Now for our favorite thing, the PROS/CONS area!

Main Ship   5/5

Heavily armed, looks like it could go really fast, and it has two really neat alien/crystal holders which are so far exclusive to the mars mission series. Also has a blunt shooter.
It has a few small holes in the body, but thay are easily repairable.

Alien ship   4/5

Very nice, several laser cannons and a rapid-fire rotating laser cannon. Doesn't have a visible engine, and the rotator cannon sticks out of the bottom of the ship.

Driller vehicle   5/5

Nice, but not much to say about it other that it can attatch to the dropship, and that the drill should be able to move more.

"Darth_Shockwave","2007-09-29T12:03:06.95Z","A brilliantly put together set","When I first saw this set, I was amazed by the design. It reminds me off a cross between the Aliens dropship, Hunter Killer from Terminator and the Orca fighters from Command and Conquer. It could do with some slight modifications to improve the design, such as an extra set off engines under the wings, an extra missile launcher on the other wing and the neck being more stable. All off which are easy to modify. I'm not too keen on the pod hanging off the sides as they tend to droop downwards, you don't have to put them on though. The set is versus set, a trend Lego seem to have done for the majority off Mars Mission, aswell as other series. You get an Alien fight jet too, which reminds me off the troop dropship from Minority Report. Also included is a small drill buggy which can fit nicely under the dropship. 
Anyway onto the pro's and con's: -

Pro's: - 
Good use off colours
Cockpit can double as an escape pod
Awesome weapons
One the best designs ever, really
Use's the old Space logo from the 80's(look at the tail stickers)
With the removal off one piece, the ship can carry an Astrofighter on it's back, a small orange grill piece, that sits on the back between the wings

Con's: -
The pods on the side droop downwards
Aliens are pretty much static, they can only move at the legs
Could do with aonother missile launcher on the other wing

Overall, this set is well worth buying, and you can buy many to get yourself a nice airforce to establish airiel superiority over the Aliens. 4 out of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2007-11-04T14:14:52.357Z","One of the best Mars Mission sets.","Behold my very first pro/con based review since my joining of Brickset.


~PROS~

- The Dropship is exceptionally well designed. It looks streamlined and plays like a Dropship should. Cool details on the weapons.

- The rover/mining vehicle that accompanies the Dropshop actually attaches to the bottom of the Dropship without falling off.

- The Alien attack ship is very cool, with great pieces and a sturdy construction. It's my personal favorite of all of the Alien fighters that accompany the larger Mars Team vehicles. 

- One of the few sets that doesn't accidentally eject it's Alien pilots from the cockpit. 

- Not a bad price-to-piece ratio.

~CONS~

- Don't expect to be impressed by the Alien minifigures, a plight that bothers all Mars Mission sets. The drawback is no different here.

- For some reason, the Dropship's cockpit is connected to a ball joint. It's kind of cool at first, but it swings around at times. This may or may not bother you.

I bought this on sale several months ago and have loved it ever since. The &quot;Pick-Up, Drop&quot; function works well. The set includes a decent number of figures as well as a medium-sized alien strike ship which slightly resembles a helicopter. I switched out the gun on the front with a little ray-gun. The colors on the primary model are well balanced, although the stickers are annoying (I hate stickers). I either pull 'em off in a couple weeks or never put them on at all. The ones on these lasted about a month and a half. Oh well. Pro Con time.

"Shadow_Crawler","2008-10-20T09:31:15.217Z","Somewhat Clumsy","Before I start the review, let me tell you that this is my first Mars Mission review, so please don't except a perfect review.

Box : 3/5
Huge, with a nice CGI picture THAT LIES. In the box picture, the land vehicle can be seen wielding 2 drills, but in the set it's only one drill.

RECON DROPSHIP
Building : 4/5
Very big in size, this is NOT the right set for newbies, because the pieces were so many and the building is quite hard with a few Technic building style.

How It Looks : 3/5
Clumsy (mostly because of the hangins tubes), and it's not the right ship to make the aliens scared. Looks more like a bus to me.

Playability : 4/5
Not the set to play with, because the front cockpit can move easily (it use a ball joint to connect with the main body) and the tubes can 'sway' on their own, because there's no piece to hold them solid and still.

Pros:
Huge
Back side is nicely designed
Cool weapons
Nice cockpit
Missile launcher

Cons:
2 tubes can't be still, it moves when you fly the ship and it's quite hard to make it still when you put the ship on ground
Stickers
Front side is too heavy and big compared to the 'bridge' that link the frontside with the backside.
Not 'scary-looking'
Isn't realistic, if the tubes can move when it fly, it would be very easy for the captured alien to slide down and rescued by his fellow aliens.

Overall : 4/5

LAND VEHICLE
Building : 5/5
Nice to buil this part, it's quite easy and it's not boring.

How It Looks : 3/5
Just standard, small drilling vehicle with a cockpit and a drill.

Playbility : 5/5
This is great to play with, mostly because of the wheels and the drill, plus you can make it hang to the Recon Dropship.

Pros:
Huge wheels
Ability to hang to the recon Dropship
Nice drill

Cons:
Stickers

Overall : 4/5

ALIEN STARSHIP

Building : 5/5
Very nicely designed, the instructions were very clear with upside picture.

How It Looks : 5/5
Perfectly scary and elegant at the same time

Playability : 5/5
Easy to handle and have many laser cannons, this starship also consists two power crystals and 2 aliens to make it more realistic.

Overall : 5/5

So, after all, the Recon Dropship and the Land Vehicle aren't much, the real reason for you to buy thie set is the alien starship. It's really cool. Personally, I won't buy this set if it's not on 30% discount. I give this 4/5

"bricklord","2008-02-23T09:18:24.857Z","Nearly Perfect Set","I got this set just before yule and have enjoyed it immensely.  Many reviewers have talked about this set, but I wanted to weigh in as well.

Pros:
- 3 vehicles in 1 box (alien fighter, mining unit, recon ship)
- the recon ship can pick up and carry the little miner (and it stays there while flying around!)
- Chock-full of weapons (11 at last count, including a firing missile)
- many movable pieces (cockpit has full range of movement, wings are adjustable, back engines tilt, the pods can be moved as well)
- very sturdy design (uses technic connectors for the main body, it can take a crash or two)
- very customizable (modular construction leads to loads of possibilities)

Cons:
- the recon ship does not have an opening canopy (kind of annoyed at that)
- there is a little radar dish on the miner that falls off a lot (all the time)

The landing gear is pretty good,as in the storyline it could possibly cling to any surface.

"Lego_Aidan","2014-06-10T19:49:20.873Z","MX-71 Recon Dropship: 5/5","<p>The MX-71 is my favorite&nbsp;set of the Mars Mission line, It&#39;s perfectly constructed, with almost no flaws what so ever. The set itself has one more piece than it&#39;s larger companion, the ETX Alien Mothership&nbsp;Assault. While being smaller than it&#39;s Alien Companion, it has more detail, a better shape, more features and it has 3 VEHICLES!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build was pretty easy, though it was all fun. the 7-14 age is pretty right, but if you know me well enough, you&#39;re never too old for LEGO, so I would say 7+, anyone 7+ Will love this set.</p>

<p>The Alien Craft has &nbsp;no real features other than the spinning turret, but it&#39;s the most swooshable thing in the set.</p>

<p>The Driller and the Dropship are the two highlights of the set. The Driller is very basic, other than the clip on it used for a later feature. The Dropship can carry 2 Alien/Crystal Racks, Shoot a missile and Clip on (Pretty Securely) The Driler.</p>

<p>Because of the Features and build, it easily gets a&nbsp;<strong>5/5,&nbsp;</strong>it is up there with the MT-101 Drilling Unit, both sets are an example of Lego Perfection.</p>

"Sobel","2020-07-06T21:47:33.123Z","Yet another great all-round vehicle, transporter, dropship and battleship in one!","<p>After having finished my first complete series review (check them out, if you like), I have made it some sort of good habit for myself to review some sets of my collection in my free time. And with that and my deep passion for LEGO Space, I&#39;ll go on to review this space-themed series from the late 2000s.<br />
This was the first larger Mars Mission set I got my hands on. I got it in used condition via Ebay, but it was in a very good shape, all stickers applied, no parts missing. And I have to say, while this set has not SO many parts (less than 500), it comes out as an awesome playset and even looks great!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with most larger sets of this series, we have quite some special parts. The large orange cockpit screen is worth mentioning, as well as the two containment/transport pods, the booster rockets and, of course, the spring-loaded shooter. There are also two pipe-like connectors, several discs and a lot of transparent blasters in both blue (astronauts) and yellow (aliens). All in all, lots of parts that make playing with the set fun and hold opportunities to be used in MOCs. Eleven stickers have to be applied to this model, which is a fair amount.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Five&nbsp;minifigures are included in this set, which is a good&nbsp;number for a medium-to-larger sized set. We have two astronauts and three&nbsp;standard green Martians, one of them being entrapped in a containment pod of the dropship. One astronaut pilots the small drilling car and has to stay in its cockpit. There is no gear for either the astronauts or the aliens.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The drill unit and the alien ship are built first. While the small car is quite simple, the build of both the larger dropship and the smaller alien vehicle are quite interesting. The main structure of the white-and-orange ship is made of TECHNIC parts for great stability. The landing gear and the wings are also attached via TECHNIC pins after the central body is finished. The cockpit is also built individually and attached via a ball joint for great moveability. The cargo/containment pods are also attached to the long central TECHNIC bars.&nbsp;<br />
The alien ship gets its interesting look by fixing the discus-like parts to each side via cross axles and a part named &quot;Module Bush&quot;, which also acts as base for the side blasters. Interesting solution!<br />
All in all, the build is manageable, maybe a little difficult for some younger or inexperienced builders.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Making good use of TECHNIC bars and large shaped bricks, the finished dropship reaches quite an impressive size. In addition to that, it has some nice functions for good playability. The obvious part first: underneath the long central part the drill unit is suspended. The mechanism is quite simple: two rubber dampers are fixed next to each other and stiffened with red cross axles. The bail that is atop the small car is simply clipped between these two rubber parts. It holds very well, the car just dangles around a little. It can be &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; by simply pulling it out from underneath the transporter. The large cockpit can move quite freely in various directions due to the ball joint it is placed on. To the left and right are some impressive blaster batteries as well as a fully rotating heavy blaster respectively. The cockpit itself is better than most cockpits of this series, having controls and some sort of monitor and navigational computer. The main torso has two wings, the left one with two more blasters and the right one holding the reliable spring-loaded shooter. The large, immobile landing gear gives the model a good stand. Behind the hold for the drill car are the hangers for the containment/cargo-pods, which can also move in various directions. The tail fin holds two massive thrusters, which can also be moved up and down for steering.<br />
The small mining unit is a simple drill-platform with a small, control-less cockpit. Observe, how nicely the drill arm folds up!<br />
The alien ship is a simple, yet nice-looking vehicle without further functions. It houses two pilots with, again, no controls and a fair amount of blasters. The front-facing triple blaster can spin around.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While this series has created quite some WTF-moments for me and gave me some of the most ridiculous, poorly designed unfinished looking sets, it also has sets like this one, where almost everything fits and works out fine. I was impressed by the good size the main model turned out to be, I did not expect it to be that large. The cockpit is well-designed and perfect for a large transport, with its manoeuvrability to observe the&nbsp;landing zone. The ship has a very good amount of blasters, not too much, not too less, for its size. The rotating blasters and the spring-loaded shooter are perfect for creating epic space battles or clashes for valuable crystals. Even though the two orange pods tend to sway a little and never seem to be on the same level, they are a good addition and contribute to the transport aspect of the model. It is fascinating: This model manages to look bulky and massive on one hand and elegant and speedy on the other. Awesome! Also, the simple, but nice secondary models add greatly to the playability and overall worth of the set.<br />
What can be mentioned as a little negative point is, of course, the stupid aliens with their poor placement and the lack of controls in both the alien ship and the miner. But these small blemishes can&#39;t ruin the overall picture of a great set with lots of potential to become one&#39;s favourite set!</p>
