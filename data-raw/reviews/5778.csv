"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-20T18:08:35.917Z","First to review this fantastic set.","This is my first Mars Mission set, but it's not going to be the last if they're all this good.

PROS:
-Great color schemes.
-Foldable wings make for great play.
-Thruster design on the back of the Strike Ship is one of the coolest I have EVER seen.
-Nice pieces.
-Cockpit opens.
-Good construction and fun to build, like most 20$ sets.

CONS:
-Stickers.
-It's hard to have fun playing with the Strike Ship when the mining vehicle is the only other set it comes with.

This set is great. Awesome black/lime-green color scheme, neat little features like a rotating thruster, and an overall great design. Buy it now to encourage LEGO to make sets this good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-22T12:01:53.773Z","Coolest LEGO set in a long time","I reviewed this set already but it looks like it was ignored by the moderators.

All you fans of the ancient LEGO UFO, Insectoids, Life on Mars, and classic space will be able to appreciate everything Mars Mission is. Note logo- homage to the first space set. Note the human base. Homage to life on mars. Some of the sets look familiar. This is a very nostalgic theme, and it's also a very sophisticated theme.

...back to the set.

PROS:

- Awesome folding wing design that actually works
- Amazing rotational thruster design that's very alien looking (you can't see it too well in the picture)
- Cockpit opens
- Color scheme is great
- Great pieces

CONS:

- Alien often falls out of the cockpit
- The digging vehicle that comes with is nothing special, although it is not bad

Overall: 5

Get this set if you consider yourself a fan of LEGO space. If you don't you are not a true fan.

"Takeshi","2007-09-11T16:53:19.357Z","Maximum Alien Assault!","This set is a really cool one!

Alien Attack Ship
Pros: Clever open/shut function that makes it into a near-perfect saucer ship. Plenty of weapons, an engine, and neat little cockpit.

Cons: The light green flaps on the engine will extend too far out if spun too fast, and the alien is not attached onto the ship.

Small Driller
Pros: nice drilling arm, alien sled.

Cons: The sled for the alien ca fall off relatively easily, and the cabin falls forward (not off) if it is jarred too much.

Nice set, good addition to the Mars mission theme, especially if you need a good martian ship. Not so good if it is your first Mars Mission set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-05-27T21:42:12.87Z","AWSOME!!!!!","This is deffinatly one of the best sets this year the alien ship was much bigger than expected and the engine was very well put togetherunfortantly because of the transformation part of the set its a bit wobbly  but still cool. the aliens are neat but the holes in there chest take away from them and yes they do glow in the dark! the little truck is usefull especaly if you have other bigger sets from this them the only problem is that the minifigs have no weapons and the sticker sheet.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Evilnurn","2007-06-26T17:59:07.25Z","Good, but not great","Going along with my other Mars Mission reviews, this set is probably the best, but still nothing stellar in the lesser sets of the line.

Positives:
The alien spacecraft, obviously the highlight of this set, is well-built and has a lot of features. The cockpit looks very cool and is very streamlined. I like the &quot;attack mode&quot; function, as well as the fact that it can turn into a sort of flying saucer. The integration of the back &quot;propeller&quot; is cool, and generally sturdy.

The other half of this set, again seems like filler to make it a playset, is simple. It has a cockpit with a new orange piece, but is hard to open. The drill is a cool function and the black droid arms to hold the aliens are a good piece for MOCing. I like the Space reference on the middle desk too.

Negatives:
Not too many qualms with the spacecraft, except that in both &quot;modes&quot;, especially attack mode, the thing seems very shaky, not extremely sturdy. Though done for function, it rattles a lot and the hinges allow for extra room because they have some swing room.

The Mars rover, like I said, is simple, and quite frankly boring. The cockpit can't open easily, the drill can't go in too many positions and the alien can be stored, but it doesn't have a &quot;pod&quot; to store it in, so securing the alien can be a task.

Like I said, this set is the best of the lesser sites on a strictly piece-number for price ratio, and it is generally good, but nothing amazing.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legonater","2007-07-06T16:10:54.107Z","Awsome!","I got this set in calgary, and it is also my first Mars Mission set.

      Glowin the dark aliens. 
      awesome digging feature- it actually spins! 
      cool pod
      awesome weoponary on ship

CONS: No controls for vehicles.

"dragon_teenager","2007-11-04T22:34:11.497Z","Probably the coolest Alien fighter since the UFO series","There a ton of creative and distinctly unearthly details in the Strike fighter's structure that make it quite worth the twenty bucks.


~PROS~

- Great pieces

- Awesome details. A strange three-pronged turbine suggests a very alien propulsion system, and on top of that, you can fold it in for landing/stealth mode.

- The wings open and close. The recommended position would be open, however, since the fighter looks WAY cooler that way. 

- Comes with a human mining/recon rover. It's a nicely designed set, and it's cool to have both human and alien minifigs. Sturdy and devoid of annoying gimmicks. Definately a pro.

~CONS~

- The adjustable wings, while not fragile, will wobble as you fly the ship around. Hard to avoid, really, but it's a little annoying.

- The alien is not actually attached to the vehicle's cockpit. Why the designers were too lazy to add a quick perch for the minifig's feet? The world may never know. But in the meantime your alien may accidentally eject himself from the cockpit.

"GSX_R_4S2","2008-02-02T21:25:47.153Z","Good Battle Set","One of my dual reviews is coming up, so...

MT-11 Mining Unit

Positives

As you can guess, this is my name for the mining thingy. It lloks overall nice, as it can hole an alien and mine at the same time (which not most small units can do) so that makes it good in my book. The flaps on the side of the cockpit can adlust, which would give an effect possibly to scare away aliens like a frilled lizard. It has a few Space refrences, so that's nice.

Negatives

This is not exactly the best part ever, but it is one of the few small land units that actually are meant solely to mine and-or capture, in our case both. (The others being the trike and the robot that comes with the Infiltrator.) The thing can't hold the pod like other sets, instead using little arms which stick it in place. Its dimensions don't allow it to be compact anywhere, and so its mining range is nearly futile.

Overall a neccesary part of an MM team.

ETX Alien Striker

Positives

IT TRANSFORMS. OOOH. NEED TRANSFORMEY THINGY. Isn't that what calls out to everyone? But, in both forms, it does look nice. In the stealth form, it looks very sleek and made to sneak around. But in attack form, it unveils its armada of weapons, which possibly can topple a Dropship or Crystal reaper, and becomes easily the third-largest alien ship, the second being the Infiltrator and the biggest the Mothership. The sheer amount of weapons and lasers on this can overwhelm even a Hypersonic Aircraft, which, as you can see, has plenty of guns all over itself. Sorry I talk so much about the guns, but aside from the nice eye candy and the cool propeller, its all there is to the ship.

Negatives

All I can say badabout the ship is that the wings are a little wobbly. They always look ready to fall apart despite the fact that the instructions make it look like it would be held together nicely. 

The Striker is sure to be an alien fan's fave, as the whole set seems focused on it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bricklord","2008-03-12T11:02:58.903Z","Lots of detail for a nice price.","I was really looking forward to getting this set.  The Mars mission sets need more aliens,in my estimation.  This set is just the thing to fill that gap.<br><br>The construction of the fighter can a little tricky but it is worth the effort.  I have never seen an alien fighter with more weapons.  There are 15 at my count and it could go as high as 19 with a little customization.  That's a lot of firepower for something that's not a mothership.<br><br>The little miner vehicle isn't that great, but I like it.  The drill part is very movable and could be customized into something even more movable.  The cockpit doesn't have an opening canopy, but many of the Mars Mission sets don't.  So, I wasn't surprised by this.  A little custom work and presto, an opening canopy.<br><br>I have only two complaints about this set.  The alien doesn't stay in his cockpit very well, and stickers!<br><br>There is nothing wrong with this set that five minutes of customization can't fix.  This is a solid set if you're looking for alien craft.",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"Hedgehog87","2007-12-19T15:47:11.903Z","Sweet!","This set is awesome! It was my first set and one of my favorites. It is the only set where the aliens have the total advantage. Even in the mothership set, the humans have plenty of defense.

"Kapoka79","2008-07-13T18:26:03.53Z","Could Be Better","This set is another one out there for the Mars Mission collection. It inculdes a human mining vehicle and alien ship.

Pros

2 cool glow in the dark aliens and one astronaut
Mining vehicle comes with aa tray thingy but surprisingly it's not in one of the orange canisters it usually is found in.
The alien ship's wings fold out and back in pretty easily.
Lots of cool looking guns on the alien ship.
In the back it has a tail with green flaps that add great detail.
Alien cockpit folds up nicely.

Cons

The drill on the mining vehicle is pretty corny and can't do much.
The cockpit looks like a piece junk and is really hard to get open with those white flaps in the way all the time.
The wheels don't always move but sometimes get stuck or fall off.
A tad overpriced (On my opinion.)

I couldn't decide to  give it a 3 or a 4 so really I would have just given it a 3 1/2.

It's not worth the money for the hunk a' junk mining vehicle but the alien ship is pretty cool/

"HQuiff","2009-02-19T14:02:20.467Z","I'm Reckoning... Best Space Set!","This is an amazing set! It truly is! I got it for Christmas day in 2007. It is pretty sweet! I got it along with the Trike.
The build and the functions are lovely! Especially the functions with the Alien ship. The wings on it can turn in wonderfully, the back engine is really neat with the spinning system and the rest, and the cabin isn't half bad either.
The Astro's vehicle works nicely too! The wheel work smoothly on any surface, the thing with the alien works as well, the mining ability runs smoothly along with the rest (It works in the plot too), and the detachable escape pod comes off and on easily enough. So I'd say this may be the best space set (Yet). I still haven't got any more Mars Mission since this one and the Trike, and now that the theme is going out I won't be able to get more sets (I think Mars Mission is better then the Space Police). But, considering I have this set I;m happy enough! That proves that it's a worth while get! Also, get it soon before it's gone from the shelves (Unless you already own it).
Anyway, I can't finish with out the Pros & Cons.

Pro(s):
- Wicked Alien fighter.
- Alien Fighters ability to spread it's wings out is awesome and the lasers too.
- Two aliens in one set! LOL!!
- Mars Mission Astronaut.
- There's a Mars Mission vehicle with brilliant functions (Read above)
- First Mars Mission Set for me!
- Nice stickers.
- One of each vehicle is cool for a mini battle!
- All functions work well (Not just one or two)

Con(s):
- Alien is wobbly in his cabin.
- Maybe bigger wheels for the Miner? Just a thought.

That about sums it up! Good set, with one problem and an idea to make it possibly better. Pretty good! It passes my test anyway.

And I have to admit that I underestimated this theme because I was happy with my LEGO Space (Life On Mars) sets. Actually the Mars Mission theme is a remake of Life On Mars which was produced in 2001. If you have a look at the new version you'll notice that the humans are fighting the aliens and that the weapons and the vehicles are much cooler than I thought.<br><br>This set was fun to build and it has lot's of playabilities. I'm not so happy with the Mars Mission aliens. The arms and the head are all attached to the torso and they're not movable. I didn't have that problem with the Life On Mars aliens. The vehicles of this set are awsome. We get a driller for the humans which got a driller piece which I've seen on the Turaga Whenua set from the LEGO BIONICLE theme. I also like the white and orange colors.<br><br>The space ship for the alien is my favourite vehicle in this set.

"Sobel","2015-04-11T16:15:08.587Z","My first real disappointment after building a LEGO model...","<p>First I have to say, that I really like the Mars Mission series. All the astronauts vehicles are quite cool and the build of most of them is very interesting.<br />
It&#39;s a major to the series, that most of the alien ships look somewhat... cheap. Don&#39;t get me wrong, some of them are really cool, like the ship coming with the MX-71 Dropship or the ETX Alien Infiltrator.</p>

<p>But this ship here is one of the not so good ones.<br />
But first let&#39;s look at the positive aspects. I like the small mining vehicle and the way its cockpit is attached. The shape of the alien fighter is also pretty cool.<br />
The playability is good, as with most of the sets from this series, because you get two models in one set. Now, that&#39;s all there is on the positive side for me.</p>

<p>Now the cons:<br />
Starting with the mining car, it has no openable cockpit. You have to dismantle it to get the minifigure out.<br />
The alien fighter&#39;s &quot;transformation mode&quot; looks cool on first sight, but the mechanism is somewhat shaky and the front part of it tends to hang down a little.<br />
Like several ships of this series it has WAY too many blasters! Looks somewhat ridiculous! Then there are four Technic pins on the downside of the model which serve no purpose. Why were they put there?!?<br />
And the worst point for me is, once again, the cockpit. Other models of the series had the alien pilot clipped to a bar via a clip that was attached to the hole in the alien&#39;s body. In this model, LEGO decided to spare this one single clip. A bar to attach it is there, but, well, no clip in the alien&#39;s back. So if you want to play a daring flight maneuver, you&#39;re going to see the alien pilot do a suicide dive out of his cockpit.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In my opinion, this is the worst set I got from this series until now. It looks so promising, but turns out to be designed halfheartedly and cheap in some points. What saves it from being totally worthless is the 2-in-1 effect of the set, the interesting, but easy build and the good playability.</p>
