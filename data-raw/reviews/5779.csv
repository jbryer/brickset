"Evilnurn","2007-06-26T18:07:43.123Z","Okay","Obviously, this set is a reminisce of the 7312 T-3 Trike in the Life on Mars series.

Positives:
The set has a cool suspension system, and has a good construction, and te integration of the new orange cockpit piece is cool to go along with the alien pod in the back.

Negatives:
The pieces are dense in the middle, and the rest are basically sporadic and sparse, in the case should really cost a few dollars less. The alien does tend to fall out if one moves the set too much, and it is advertised to be &quot;fast&quot;. The stickers irk a perfectionist like myself, but one to one's own.

Just a sidenote, my set in this case was missing one of the corrugated tubes to cover the front tire axels. While this doesn't apply to everyone, I had to order it from replacement parts, and they even sent me some of the wrong pieces when I tried to describe it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It is now closer to home then calgary, and I plan to get the Astro Fighter very soon. this is my second set, and it's awesome. I like the new transparent orange peices, encpiesially the alien tube thing that I call a stasis chamber. I think the dino attack head doesn't look good with the mars mission uniform, so I traded heads with my digger. It makes much more sence to me. Its unny when I zoom the trike across the floor, cause the Martian flys right out. I hope when I get the claw tank or some other set with the chamber it will have a lid.

The good - 
   1: It was bigger than I thought it would be.(About 8 and 1/2 in.long
and about 8 in. wide.)
   2: Way cool design! Has Astronaut and Alein minifigure. Two laser guns. Three big all terrain wheeels. Nice suspension. One crystal to power the vehicle. Mini pod - thing - the pilot sits in. And a containment tube to hold the Alien in on a sled. 

The bad - 
   1: The Astronaut has little space to sit in.
   2: The sled with the Alien slides out the back easily. 

   But over all: Tis is a great and awesome set!! I'm trying to collect all the Mars Mission sets! If you are too - get this set! It is also at a great price!(10.00!)

"shima55","2007-10-06T18:09:14.293Z","Nice starter Mars Mission set","A lot is riding on this theme, as Mars Mission is a chance to revive LEGO Space. For the most part, the theme as a whole does a good job. This set is a good example of a typical set for the theme, sadly, that means it is not perfect.

Pros: 
Very nice Minifigure
Colors blend nicely
Nice tires
Hinged cockpit piece
Alien glow feature works well
Suspension works great
Alien containment tube piece is good
Decent price
Very sturdy

Cons:
Alien isn't very poseable
Stickers
Alien bed comes out if you roll the vehicle
Vehicle seems somewhat more elongated than it should be
Cockpit isn't airtight

It comes with an Alien, a Human, and one green gem. The suspension is pretty cool, although you have to be careful not to bend the tecnic bars holding the back wheel. The Lasers are positioned in places where they can't easily aim at anything on the ground, or the air, but if it is just alien infantry you can run them over :) The container on the back, that holds the alien on a sled, is open and the sled will easily fall out but this can be fixed quickly by adding a tecnic bar on the back of it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Good stability and good suspension
Comes with cool alien minifig.
Comes with cool astronaut minifig.

Cons 

The front cockpit area usually breaks off a lot.
When it moves the tray in the back usually falls out.

"vezon8764","2008-09-28T16:03:48.95Z","Nice Trike","While this has cool suspension (by use of a rubber piece that is attached to an axle), and the back wheel is a nice way to make this set a Trike, it does have some flaws. The &quot;guns&quot; on the top of the opening glass cockpit are completely useless, and the cockpit has to be cranked down 3 clicks for the person to sit inside. That, and the fact that, since this set has only 3 wheels, you can't really make it into an alternate model.
Pros:
Rare Astronaut (by that, I mean a rare head)
Alien and tray
Suspension
Cons:
When you zoom the Trike forward, the tray slides out of the back.
Only one crystal
Limited alternate construction
Kinda easy to build
Nobody to fight against

the trike itself is almost identical to it's 2001 counter part, but with a more modern color scheme.
in it self, the contents are a kick-butt vehicle, an alien transport tray,
an alien, an astronaught, and an energy crystal.
the extra pieces wheren't much, just a joy stick, a vizor, and a few studs of various praportions.
now for the pros and cons.

pros:

definately worth the money.
2 gold vizors, if you like that kinda stuff.
has a rubber shock, so it bounces on the carpet as you play.
the most sweet head out of all the astronaughts in mars mission.
aliens chest glows in the dark.


cons:

alien is only 2 pieces.(it doesn't bother me but some of you may want to know)
vizors paint wheres off extremely quick.
if you drive it along a tile floor it's wheels make a very loud klunking noise.
no weapon for astronaught or alien.

"Sobel","2020-06-17T21:50:35.597Z","Good design, unfortunately not much more.","<p>After having finished my first complete series review (check them out, if you like), I have made it some sort of a good routine for myself to review some sets of my collection in my free time. And with that and my deep passion for LEGO Space, I&#39;ll go on to review this space-themed series from the late 2000&#39;s.<br />
This trike features a nice design, but a lack of basic functions. Let&#39;s see it in detail.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>With less than a hundred parts, there are quite some interesting pieces to this set. I liked the dome-like cockpit, the big wheels (keep on turning) and the storage pod for the captured alien. This set, like most of this series, comes with a lot of stickers, seven, to be precise. Personally, I think this is a lot for a set this size.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are two minifigures included, an astronaut and an alien. The alien is the usual ugly green klutz, while the spaceman has a detailed&nbsp;spacesuit. Interestingly, the oxygen tank is also printed on his back, so no more of the classic space double-oxygen-tanks. Seems a little cheap to me, but also saves some space.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The base of the vehicle is formed by some TECHNIC parts to support the storage pod in the back and the large suspension for the wheels.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure, if this happened only to me, but one of the black cross-axles got somehow twisted, I dunno why... Well, the build is not that complicated, the instructions booklet is pretty self-explanatory.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This trike has near to no real functions. It has a &quot;working&quot; suspension, which has an interesting design. The pilot sits in an awkward position on a downward facing&nbsp;ramp with two blue blasters. This ramp acts as cockpit with a single lever and a transparent dome not fully covering it. Behind the cockpit is an energy crystal and two forward facing blasters. In the back is a tube-like chamber for transporting the captured alien.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As the title implies, this set has quite a cool look to it, but that&#39;s all. The suspension is OK, I like the simplicity in which it is created. The big wheels move freely, so the trike can be pushed forward nicely.<br />
But the overall design has many flaws. The awkward positioning of the pilot, the lack of any real controls in the &quot;cockpit&quot; and the containment unit in the back that has no lock or barrier whatsoever, so the alien falls out as soon&nbsp;as the whole thing is tilted more than 25&deg;. There are models in this series, that have such a mechanism. I do absolutely not comprehend, why it was left out here.<br />
So, if you want a good-looking, planet-exploring ground vehicle for little money, this is it. Nothing less, but also nothing more.</p>
