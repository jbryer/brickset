"Legonater","2007-07-25T22:19:03.77Z","Even better than I thought","I know I reviewed this set before, but now I own it, And I'll like to show what I think now.

Pros: Awesome gun.
      cool cockpit.
      rotating wings
      jewel!

CONS: Um... somebody help please?

All in all, now i still don't like the fact that there's one gun, but the fire power is great enough that that's all it needs.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lego_K","2007-09-17T21:46:01.403Z","Cheap and very cheerful set.","In the UK this set is a mere &#163;4, I picked up two (one as a wingman) and I intend on getting at least one more for a three fighter squadron.

For such a small set it stands out and has good qualities.

The white scheme with orage highlights and its general angular design work really well, and the orange cockpit sheild is a nice smooth design which compliments well.

The jet could do with having an identical gun on the other side too, but it doesn't ruin it by having only one.

The fighter does hae a nice landing function, by simply tilting the wings up so they are level to the ground the jet can land on its central area, or as I call it its landing skid.

The additional alien isn't much use, but if you do buy a squadron of these you do end up with a small battalion of aliens you can then use with the other sets.

Only minus points in this set are the lack of firearms for the figures. The slight lack of cockpit protection is a minus, but its forgivale for such a easy obtainable set.

"_whateverist","2007-12-21T08:05:21.687Z","Some flaws, but good overall ","The Astro Fighter is a very good small set. The craft itself looks great, with four moving parts (cockpit, wings and the laser), a great colour scheme and a very sturdy construction. The pointy wings and big laser cannon look menacing without becoming silly. The set also comes with a lot of useful and interesting parts, from the canopy and the hinges to the neat crystal.
The pilot minifig look good, but the alien is just terrific, resembling a cross between a transparent Gorn and the creature from Alien. 
There are two small downsides, however. The cockpit is barren (no controls whatsoever and the pilot is sitting too far back to even see where he's going) and it's disappointing that you have to fiddle with small stickers, but those two small niggles don't drag this set down.

The two minifigures included were too included with other Mars mission sets. The astronaut, is nice designed and simple, another cool minifigure for the space theme. But the alien is poor made, it don't have much lego style, have problems on the movements, don't moves well the legs, the details are hidden with this green color, that altough have the feature to glow in the dark, the color of the minifigure should be better, have more details, and also the original shape, like the old alien minifigures (UFO, Insectoids), or the colors and shape of the aliens minifigures of the Life on Mars theme. The building involved in this small is the astronaut's spaceship, that have as base, some plates connected, under all the other pieces. On each side, the wings can moves, it is a good feature, but the wings could be more increased, the plates that makes it are simple and unfit sometimes. The cockpit, on the front, have a cool color, the orange, but the minifigure don't stay very well in it, the minifigure cannot sit on it, it still stretched out, so, this isn't the best position for the minifigure on it. On the back, there are some blocks increasing the spaceship, that makes it looks like more comp&#180;lete, and these are increased with a little &quot;missile&quot; (but this cannot be launched, it stay in the spaceship). Altough this part of the back have some details to make it more complete, the stickers aren't good for it. So, due to the alien minifigure, position of the cockpit, stickers, and so much simple wings, altough this is a  cheap set, some other cheap sets are better than this, like other bionicle, city, creator or Star Wars.

The Astro Fighter bears a somewhat vague resemblance to the Star Wars Snowspeeder due to the color scheme and the default wing position.

For no apparent reason, the plane comes with a single solitary alien fig which all of you know has only one articulation point and is very useless.

<p>This set features nothing special, no special parts (except for the windshield perhaps), no special functions, no special playability. OK, it was pretty cheap, but still I expect a minimum of creativity in a LEGO model.</p>

<p>The optical design is quite good for such a small model. It has a nasty looking cannon to blast the evil aliens, which looks pretty intimidating!<br />
A big flaw in my opinion is the total absence of real <strong>thrusters</strong> or engines or some kind of propulsion. There are only two stickers attached to the rear of the model which are to give a look of some booster-power-blaster-engine-...things. Back in the 90&#39;s, all LEGO spaceships had REAL boosters! I guess it would not have been a big deal to add those to the model.<br />
Another flaw is the <strong>cockpit</strong>: how does the pilot control this thing? With his mind? There are no control panels, switches or levers!</p>

<p>Alien however... looks very soulless and can only move legs. Glow in dark torso is cool though.</p>

<p>The Fighter looks pretty good with a cannon mounted on the side. The side of the cockpit doesn&#39;t look great but i can forgive that because it&#39;s a small set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cockpit closes and opens well. You can move the wings down and it kinda looks like a mech when they&#39;re fully down. not an intended function, but it is a fun thing.</p>

<p>PPP Is good and we get some great parts. Just overall a nice set!</p>
