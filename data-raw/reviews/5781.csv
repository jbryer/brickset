"Evilnurn","2007-06-26T17:50:34.73Z","Okay","Immediately upon looking at the choices of Mars Mission sets, I had to decide between this and the MX-71 Recon Dropship. Eventually, after comparing prices and pieces, I decided on this one. The set is a decent set, but I realized my fears that it was more money than the pieces were necessarily worth.

Positives:
Beginning with the tank, the base has a sturdy construction, and the suspension system is good, but sometimes the treads don't want to turn because they are stuck in their primary position. I'm sure they'd be fine after some wear though. Next, the top portion is decently well built, and I like the detail on the arms and middle portion especially. The ball joints are good, and their connection to system bricks makes a Bionicle fan glow. 

Moving on to the alien spacecraft, I again liked the detail and the fact that one can fold in the wings is cool, but it's very simple.

Negatives:
This set had its fair share of things wrong. Like I said before, the treads are sometimes hard to turn. The alien pod/tube things in the front seemed like they were just space fillers, even though they can dump the pods out as well as hold them. I've never had a disk launcher, and quite frankly I wasn't impressed, the firing distance is not far and they are small and easy to lose. The cockpit shield is kind of weak, and can be opened, but one has to be careful not to break some parts of the set. Again, not so many parts for the money.

The alien spacecraft seems like just another thing to make a generic set into a playset. My main problem is that the two green &quot;tentacles&quot; that make up the cockpit can't move, you have to open up the cockpit with a hinge opening downward, and it's not easy or fun to do.

So generally, this set is okay, if one wants to have all of the Mars Mission sets, but it's nothing spectacularly impressive.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"krysto2002","2008-07-24T17:12:17.483Z","The lesser of the evils, but still too many stickers","This is probably one of the best sets in the series, since most of the others stink! This one is decent, and for once, looks cool and is cool. The LEGO description is pretty accurate, the set does have a disk launcher (but LEGO was stingy with disks), posable claws (whose serrated edges keep them from being totally worthless), a laser cannon (which looks moderately powerful), a rotating torso (which uses a really cool turntable), posable arms, a missile launcher, and a shocks system on the wheels, allowing for better handling. The alien strike craft is designed cool, but I have no clue why the wings swivel...

The set has too many stickers, 18 to be accurate, so a word to LEGO if they haven't already recieved the message:
(to be screamed as load as possible)
&quot;STOP USING SO MANY STICKERS, START PRINTING MORE DECORATED PARTS!&quot;

The design is pretty cool and the whole set has plenty of playability, since LEGO finally got the whole good guy and bad guy in one set thing straight (finally...).

The capsules are cool, but the storage for them is sort of flimsy and wobbles in this set. Another pair of arms to hold them would help.

Overall, a great set, and since it is slowly falling into the clearance rack, it is a great deal.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Batmaniam","2009-03-23T12:12:36.31Z","Not Worth It","This is not a ""terrible"" set, but it isn't really a good one. Sure it has some nice pieces, okay aliens, and one human fig. But overall it just seems empty. After about a week of my having this, it was taken apart, and turned into spare pieces. Also soooo many stickers. There is like 15 of them. I do like the arms though. I put the claw arm in my batcave to help repair the vehicles. Lots of nice crystals. And the alien ship is fairly good. But not that good. I really don't like Mars Mission, if you want some space sets don't waste your money on this, get Star Wars, or get Space Police 3 when it comes out. But it is nice to have some of the pieces, the disk launcher works good as a chimney. So I rate it a three.

"Sobel","2020-07-01T20:50:47.043Z","Impressive all-rounder for transport, exploration and combat!","<p>After having finished my first complete series review (check them out, if you like), I have made it some sort of good habit&nbsp;for myself to review some sets of my collection in my free time. And with that and my deep passion for LEGO Space, I&#39;ll go on to review this space-themed series from the late 2000s.<br />
While having a decent design, this medium-sized set also scores in regard of functions and playability. It features some interesting new parts, but also a little lack in minifigures and some wasted opportunities.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Obviously, quite some special parts here! We have a large, transparent orange cockpit window for 180&deg; view, rubber chain tracks (duh), two containment/storage pods and several multi-angle joints for the arms. Another new part is the disc launcher mounted to the left of the cockpit. It has a tube-like magazine and you can fling a single disc by pulling back and releasing a small lever, quite similar to the shooter of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7646-1/ETX-Alien-Infiltrator"">ETX Alien Infiltrator</a> and the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7645-1/MT-61-Crystal-Reaper"">MT-61 Crystal Reaper</a> (check out my reviews!). Seven energy crystals are included, as well as fifteen stickers, begging to be applied. Once again, this series does not fail to annoy us with its abundance of stickers...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>For a set this size, three minifigures are a little cheap. There is only one astronaut and two standard green aliens. I would have liked another astronaut, maybe with some little aircraft or a jetpack or something. One of the aliens pilots the small alien fighter, the other one is impaled on a cargo tray and stored in a containment pod. There is no additional gear for any of the minifigures</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As usual, the alien ship is build first and it&#39;s very simple.&nbsp;<br />
The base of the Claw Tank is made of some TECHNIC bars to form the chassis and hold the rubber damper supported suspension. The rest of the build is pretty straightforward from bottom to top. The arms are attached half-way through building the &quot;head&quot; and the model is finished by attaching the disc-shooter. Nothing too fancy or difficult, yet interesting to see how the base and everything comes together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Overall, this Mech has quite a cubic shape, being nearly as high as it is wide and long. The large orange rubber chain tracks work quite well on any surface, even though they tend to get a little deformed and go out of round. The two cargo/containment pods hold a captured alien and a tray with some energy crystals, respectively. Unfortunately, these pods don&#39;t have a lock, once again... The &ldquo;torso&rdquo; and what seems like a power generator are situated above the large turntable, which allows the pilot to do complete 360&deg; turns. The &quot;head&quot; is dominated by the large orange cockpit window, behind which the pilot controls his vehicle via two levers. To the pilot&#39;s right is an arm with a large, toothed claw (nice to see the old TECHNIC gear counterparts here), which can be moved in any direction via two joints. On the left side is another super-flexible arm with two impressive energy blasters. Atop the &ldquo;head&rdquo; are two more defensive systems in form of three missiles and the disc launcher (description above).<br />
The small alien ship is a simple construction with the ability to fold up for better camouflage, making detection more difficult. It has quite a large blaster array for such a small ship and also, what (to me)&nbsp;appeared to be some sort of projectile gun as an alternative to blasters. The alien pilot is simply attached by his feet to some double-knobbed bricks, so at least he doesn&#39;t fall out.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>LEGO robots and mechs were always a huge thing for me, ever since I got the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6889-1/Recon-Robot"">1994 Spyrius Recon Robot</a>. And this fella here is a nice addition to any Space or Mech collection. The many functions give kids lots and lots of possibilities to play and&nbsp;redesign and even different ways of presentation for an AFOL. I liked how the arms are made so versatile and mobile in almost every direction. Also, the vehicle is not over-armed, liked other sets of this series, yet it packs some nice, again versatile firepower, having not only blasters, but three (four, if you count the claw) different weapon systems. Gives me some good old Mechwarrior vibes here... When I got this set used via Ebay, I had my doubts how the rubber tracks would work out and in what shape they&#39;d be. Turned out they were still very flexible ran well on every surface (maybe no fluffy carpet) when you give the model a constant push. The small alien vehicle also was a positive surprise. While being so simple, it looks OK and folds up nicely for optimal camouflage.<br />
What kept this set from getting full five stars was, again missed opportunities or pure laziness and the lack of minifigures. As mentioned before, one more minifigure with some tiny jet or jetpack would have been good, in my opinion. Such a jet could have found a place to be attached in the back of the Mech&#39;s torso or base, where space could have been used a little more effectively. Just look at the secondary model in the ETX Alien Infiltrator (link above)! The cockpit could have used some sort of monitor, so why not put a sticker on the INSIDE of it? And, again, the two orange pods have no locks whatsoever.&nbsp; So be careful when carrying this model around or your imprisoned alien or precious crystals might get lost...</p>
