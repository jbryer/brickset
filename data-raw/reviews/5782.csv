"Knightsword","2007-08-17T00:23:21.317Z","Great Set","The Drilling Unit is, as they say 3 vehicles in one, the main 6 wheeled truck, a mid size space shuttle and a small 2 wheeled car. Also with the set is a small alien fighter. The smaller car docks in the back of the shuttle and in turn the shuttle docks on the back of the truck. The drill on the truck is more believable then some of the smaller sets and the truck is armed with a ball launcher ala Bionicle. The truck is about 9 inches tall and a little over a foot long. All in all its a fun set to build and makes a great display piece.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl_Sagan","2007-12-21T00:59:36Z","Underrated","  This set is one of the most underrated of 2007. Although I found it to be a bit of a let-down that there were no tools, walkie-talkies, binoculars, or even guns, the overall design of the vehicle is really quite remarkable. Before you continue reading this review, I urge you to compare this big wheeler to the only other space set which is similar: 6989 (enter it in the search box on the top right of this page). 
  You will find that the mega-core magnetizer really set the pace for these big wheeled space vehicles. As you can tell just from the image the set has three small craft, several storage containers, and emphasizes on the uses of the magnet to create and overall great set. on the other hand, the wheelbase for 6989 isn't nearly as wide as the armored drilling unit and doesn't appear to be as durable. 
  Yet the armored drilling unit is probably one of the most durable lego sets for its size not under the technic or bionicle label. All of the mars mission sets (except for the micro-flyer ship) are built on an incredible solid technic chassis allowing the mars mission ships and vehicles to have multiple mobile parts while being remarkably strong. The drilling unit in particular reab=ps the benefit of the technic chassis by having a suspension system. The suspension system doesn't use springs at all however, and instead uses the weight of the vehicle with one set of four wheels in the back and the set of two in front which surprisingly make a large vehicle (this thing is a beast, and I mean it) surprisingly agile. The front suspension system is angled to take most of the  beating which the vehicle runs into as it is racing over rough terrain while the back set of four masterfully balances the vehicle. Just having one of the systems to support this vehicle would be disastrous, but the combination of the two is just right. 
  In addition to providing as a great chassis to build a suspension system on, the main frame of the drilling unit is built right on top of the four rear wheels and as a result is capable of carrying substantially large cargo. TLC decided to use the rear space to make a launch station for a light reconnaissance/dropship. The ship carries a cool one person two-wheeled motorcycle vehicle with a windshield that flips up. When the ship lands directly on flat ground (the ship wing design kinda reminds me of an x-wing, except with only two cannons) the two-wheeler is pushed up out of its cradle-carrier and out over the back of the ship (a clever detail if you ask me). The ship is neat but nothing really special, it has two large cannons on two of the four wings, can carry two alien canisters attached to an arm device on each side of the ship, and has a neat cockpit with two different computer manuals. 
(Back to the main unit)
the cockpit to the main unit is really big and is centered in front of the vehicle at an angle. The cockpit is set up for one person at the controls (three computers and an joystick, yes) but there is lots and lots of room behind the person, like three people with room to spare for additional computers, coffeemakers, massage chairs... by now you should get the idea that it is a big cockpit. But the cockpit only comes set up for one person.
  
  The thing about this set is that it has a lot to offer, big sets often have several people and some vehicles or additional setups apart from the main unit. The thing is that those sets also have tools, while this set has none to speak of, just a huge drill and a zamor gun with two extra zamors in a tray in the mid-section of the chassis. I look at this set as two things, the first being a cool design and great concept with great functionality and two vehicles to top it off, the second being an opportunity to turn this set from cool to diabolically cool with the help of a little imagination, spare parts, and good judgement so as not to ruin a good model. 
  I still say that this set is underrated. True, it is expensive but I think you can do more with this set than a lot of other ones and despite the lack of tools and interior detail, I really like this set and highly recommend it, you don't have to be a mars mission fan or even a space fan to appreciate and like this set. get it and give yourself a pat on the back when you are finished building it. The build is worth it and it will be hard to pull your eyes away from the product sitting on your table.

Pros:
three different minifigs
two vehicles and a ship,
cool design for each one that you will like
huge drill
BIG wheels
suspension system and size which will run over your or your fronds droid army with ease

Cons:
 lack of any tools whatsoever
small box for storage (but that doesn't matter, this baby will stay on your shelf for ages)

Overall:
I strongly recommend this set to any lego fan
this set seems slightly incomplete in some areas, but on the other hand is one of the best opportunities for making an awesome set an untouchable set that will better suit your own opinions with modification.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"jamzee44","2008-02-03T15:58:53.7Z","Truly essential","Just a truly spectacular set - I'm a big fan of Lego Space and was keen to check out the Mars Mission sets of which I have the Recon Dropship and Astro Fighter.  The Armoured Drilling Unit has kept me spell-bound for months in the Lego Catalogue - in fact the picture of it in the catalogue is the best of it - alot of the pictures of this set online *do not* do it justice nor do they convey the scale of the beast!  For UK readers, the picture of it on the Argos website is pretty good.

I took the plunge and got this set today and if you are into Mars Mission/Space, then please grab this set at your earliest opportunity - the build is quite lengthy coming in at (well) over two hours (incl. stickers!) with two books and as you go you realise that you are constructing something pretty special (and destruction-proof!) Hint - do keep a very close eye on the cockpit instructions for both the dropship and rhino itself. Also, when building the suspension, there are two grey axles that stick out enough to touch the wheels either side (rear set of two wheels) when they are turning (especially over undulating terrain) - this does make it sound like it's rumbling and it's quite possible it is supposed to be like this, but if you'd rather not have it, make sure the axels are pushed in 3/4s of a unit and you should have enough clearance.

The &quot;drop nose&quot; design of both the Recon Dropship and this appeal to me massively and are bit of a change for Lego.  What is as refreshing as ever is TLCs ingenious design and build technology that will have you smiling with appreciation numerous times as you savour the construction of the set. 

A invaluably worthy addition to any Mars Mission fleet and the Armoured Drilling Unit looks absolutely stunning upon completion - I can't stop looking at it or rolling it around and launching the dropship off the back with the trike - So, so good.  If you display your sets, try placing something under the odd wheel to get the suspension shown off to great effect!

Utterly unmissable and truly essential - pick it up while you can.  Rating it - well it blows any scale into oblivion!

The alien ship is ok, but the wings bend back too much. :P

The mini rover is nice, and if you tilt the model back, it flies off.

The jet is cool, but the pods tilt too much.

The main unit ROCKS! The cockpit is spacious, big enough for 3 astronauts. The drill is perfect, along with everything else!

I just want to emphasized that the Alien Craft is MISERABLE! Its like leftovers being made into soemthing and then.. &quot;Lets call it the Alien Badguy&quot;

I took the Alien Craft apart and use most of its part to make the already Awesome ADU.. even more Awesome!!

"Lolbrick","2009-11-12T11:23:56.827Z","Very good, but as always there's flaws.","I really liked many stuff of this sets like the wheels are extreamly well done, they have suspension and works like a real moon car and the drill is also pretty cool although the construction of it has been used many times before, but it has a neat design.
The hangar roof opens and closes in an original way, there's also a ball-shooting mechanism.
The design of this set is just awesome!

However I thought the space ships were poorly done and the boxes of aliens and crystals falls out easily.
And also, not so sound nit-picking but that's required in a good solid review, the cockpits has gaps which for a realistic view all the air should dissappear and frankly I've always been obsessed with having a solid cockpit covering all air gasps.

Anyways, despite the cons it's a must buy for a Lego fan, especially if you like Mars Mission!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Sobel","2015-03-27T20:20:01.037Z","Must be the LAAARGEST Ground-Vehicle from LEGO!!","<p>Seriously, this whole Mars Mission series is quite cool for a modern LEGO theme. I liked the 90&#39;s themes better, but this series has some awesome models with it!</p>

<p>And this is DEFINITELY one of them!</p>

<p>First of all, this thing is <strong>HUGE</strong>! The massive wheels are bigger than any I had in my collection till now! The shooter is quite cool and has a very long range, even more than the spring-loaded shooters from the MX-81 for example! You have to be a little more careful, since the spheres you can shoot are solid, not made of rubber, like the arrows from the other shooters...</p>

<p>The ADU features something I love most in special LEGO sets: It is separable!!!! A medium-sized aircraft is carried in the back of the vehicle, and this aircraft carries another small planetary rover. It&#39;s like a craft in a craft in a craft - <strong>LEGOception</strong>!!<br />
The drilling arm is very large, too and extends to almost every direction!</p>

<p>The build of this set is quite challenging! The internal structure is almost completely built from TECHNIC elements, which make it very sturdy. The suspension of the wheels gives the ADU the chance to drive over some difficult terrain, and even to drive almost one half of it over an abyss! The rear wheels still hold it on the ground.</p>

<p>But, as always, there are some cons.<br />
First, it is the small rover. As stated in other reviews, it has no visual engine, no controls, nothing.<br />
Next, the landing platform for the aircraft is always a bit loose and tends to shake, when driving the ADU.</p>

<p>And third, and biggest flaw: That stupid alien-fightercraft!!!! Good grief, what did LEGO have in mind, when they put such a cheap and loveless designed piece of junk to an awesome model like the ADU?!? They could have just left it, or even put in a cool alien ship, like withe the MX-81 or the MX-71!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, this is still a great set and an absolute must-have for every true fan of LEGO! I know no bigger ground-vehicle than this one. It would have been a none-plus-ultra set, if the alien fighter was designed better!<br />
But nevertheless: thumbs up!!</p>
