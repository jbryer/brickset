"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-07-18T07:24:11.81Z","Two great vehicles - plus blue Batman!","This set contains two vehicles of the same size, unlike its counterparts in which Batman always has the way larger vehicle. The Batcopter is given a very military and somewhat awkward, blocky, design, but is impressive no doubt. The plane fits in well with Scarecrow's theme, being a vintage cropsprayer. Frankly, I think Scarecrow's plane is better-designed than Batman's helicopter, although it is an old model used in earlier Lego sets. It is great to see a blue-coloured Batman, even though it is a little cartoonish. Scarecrow's appearance in this set allows those who can't afford or can't find Arkham Asylum to own the rather well-designed, and quite significant, Batman villain. This is quite an okay set overall, around the same above-average quality as its counterparts.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Skut","2008-02-10T06:23:26.937Z","Great chopper; average plane","This set is must for any Batman collector for one reason alone: BLUE Batman.  Very cool.  The rest of the set is generally of solid quality and is an entertaining, non-repetitive build.  

The Scarecrow plane is a bit flimsy, especially the bomb release mechanism, but I guess he was never the most kitted-up of the Batman villains.  But hey no one's really buying it for the plane, are they.  

The helicopter is very nice but with a couple of annoying flaws.  First, the good: the colour scheme is will done with black and dark grey and some of the build techniques are very nice indeed, particularly around the rotor hub.  The overall effect is of a very mean-looking gunship reminiscent of a Tiger or Rooivalk.  The annoying things are (1) the main landing gear is fixed which, strictly speaking, is more realistic to a real-world gunship but, hey it's Batman and an undercarriage that folded back against the chopper body would have been sooo nice; and (2) the lack of a tail totor - a really annoying oversight.  Indeed a better option for Lego would have been to give Scarecrow a monoplane and the Batcopter contra-rotating main blades like a Kamov Werewolf.  Oh well, we can but dream (or convert)...  

Overall a solid set.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-18T05:46:50.827Z","Holy cop, duh!","There's two vehicles of equal size in this set, and although either of the vehichles would be great separately, together, they pack a double wallop to make this set one of the Batman vehicle sets yet.

The scarecrow's crop-duster seems at first glance to be an Adventurer's bi-plane, but it's actually a modified version of it in a nice tan colour with brown high-lights.  There's guns under the wings... or are those the nozzels for spraying stuff to crop dust?  The main feature of the plane is a mechanism that allows bombs to be dropped from the passenger seat behind the driver.  It's a bit clunky, and it gives the plan a rather unaerodynamic look.  Also, the missiles can sometimes get stuck inside the chute and not launched even when the lever is pushed as there's no spring mechanism here.  Design-wise, besides the lever to launch the missiles, the plane seems nice but uninteresting... with the exception of the green canisters of gas below the wings.  They seems eerie, but works well overall for the concept of a scary Scarecrow.

The batcopter, on the other hand, seems to be a brand new design based on some of the best real-world military copters.  There's a spring-powered missile launcher built onto its left side and push missiles built into its right.  Both are, presumably built-in action features to shoot down the Scarecrow.  Design-wise, the nice extensions in front with the lights, the choice of the bricks for the blades and the dragon's wing for the tail adds so much detail to the copter.

Play-wise, both are relatively solidly built, although, like all Lego toys, very rough play will tend to destroy the model.  The use of colours has been nicely done - mostly black for batman with yellow highlights and not much of the other colours, and tan and brown for the Scarecrow with the eerie green canisters.

Overall, a good set, although by not marketing the two vehicles separately probably means that some less wealthy individuals will not get the opportunity to purchase the set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"_add_um","2008-03-13T16:02:55.293Z","Very Good","This is a quite a good set ,it has an all new Blue Batman and a rare Scarecrow but the bad thing is it has nowhere to put the Bat-weapons and it has stickers. But it is very cool set and goes great with 7782. Scarecrow has been given a new scithe and fear bombs for his biplane which was nicely designed and given a good colour scheme, the Batcopter which looks like a military helicopter is armed with a firing and flick missles too but if you want to sit Batman in properly you must take off his cape 1st.

Pros:
*firing missle (copter)
*droping bombs (plane)
*new Batman
*rare colours

Cons:
*plane only fits 1 bomb
*bat-weapons can't put into an compartment (unlike the Batmobile)
*Batman can't sit properly without his cape off
*stickers

Overall it a great addition to your Batman colllection!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"water_jedi_17","2008-03-20T14:45:12.653Z","cool!","One of my favorite batman sets this one has many features and surprises.
Scarecrow's Plane:has a spinnig propeler but if you tightly press the brick that keep it from falling, it won't move. The canister launcher is very ingenious but it gets stuck(sometimes).The plane has two canisters but I was annoyed that there was no room for the second one.The wheels on mine are very squeaky and it also has room for the guns.Scarecrows head also glows in the dark.
The batcopter has long propellors but never touch the back wing.Batman often pops out of his seat,so it takes a while to put him in.There is a secret compartment to put gadjets behind bats.The two front cannons sometimes fall off, so I suggest to put them tightly in the sockets
Overall this is a perfect set(better than the bat-tank),although lego could improve on some parts of this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2008-09-05T17:37:28.937Z","Cool Set","This is a cool set but has a few problems. The biplane looks very cool and reminds me of those planes in the Adventurers theme. The Batcopter is OK but needs a little improvement. The Scarecrow minifig is pretty cool with the broom. This is good , but needs a little work.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Captain","2008-11-08T13:43:39.873Z","I love it, both vehicles have good design and good parts too!","I remember when I first saw this set last year, I wanted to get it, but never got the chance. Just yesterday however, I saw it in a store and bought it because I never knew if I'd find it again.

The set, to say the least, is great. The vehicles both have a selection of useful parts, but the plane was a bit lacking in design. With some simple modifications, I made a more compact mechanism to drop the bombs, a better engine, and I raised the propeller assembly up by 1 plate to it matched more with the body and was farther from the ground. After some other minor tweaks, the vehicles are satisfactory.

The coolest part though, might have been Scarecrow. His head, though in picture it looks green, is a foggy brownish translucent color. It even glows in the dark, making it even better. The fear bombs also have evil jack o' lanterns inside, and the bombs and gas tanks combined give you a total of 6 trans-neon green domes, all in one set!

So that's my review. I know I focused entirely on the plane and the Scarecrow's stuff, but it was my favorite part. If you see it, get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Derek2441","2008-11-16T14:39:39.53Z","AWESOME.","I can go on all day about how awesome this set is. The best thing about it is the scarecrow. He is the coolest minifig and my favorite. Blue suited batman is also awesome.

BATCOPTER
The batcopter is batman's helicopter. It's actually not very blocky, i think it's super sleek. The spring loaded missile is cool, but the flick fire missiles aren't. They fall out. But still, the batcopter is cool. Oh yeah, the stickers are annoying.
4/5

BIPLANE
The biplane is cool. It has cool stickers and those pumpkin bombs are so awesome. They have rare pumpkin heads. The bomb droping mechanism is a bit flimsy, but it works fine. The colour scheme suits scarecrow alot. The fear gas tanks are cool. Heck, the whole plane is cool.
5/5

MINIFIGS
The scarecrow and blue batman. There both awesome. Blue suited batman has a rare blue cape and the mask. He looks a bit more like the batman in the comics. Plus, if you take his mask off, you see bruce wayne. The scarecrow is awwwwsome. He has a glow in the dark head, and a black wizard hat. His outfit is really cool to. His sythe is the same one as the castle theme and its way cooler then the one in arkham asylum
5/5

In conclusion, i give this awesome set 5 out of five. I would give it 6 but there's none you can click. Buy this set if you want the scarecrow. It's discontinued, but you can buy it on ebay. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2008-07-25T01:36:41.61Z","an army copter probably.","the design of of the batcopter does not look exactly like something batman would come up with; nevertheless, it is still a great playable flying object, which comes with another interesting villain, the scarecrow in his vintage biplane.

the batcoper could have been better designed to make it a little more slick and bat-like. it is more reminiscent of an asymmetrical military helicopter in black, and i am not sure most people wouldn't mind that this batcopter does not possess a tail propellor to keep it from spinning out of control in the air. i would have preferred ski-shaped landing gear than these wheels.

the scarecrow biplane looks more interesting to me. and i have rebuilt it to make it shorter to look like a normal biplane by removing the bomb-dropping chamber, and a small wheel at the tail end so it won't drag itself when it takes off and lands.

it is not a perfect set, but you can still modify it to make it look perfect. :)

"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-09T14:40:13.53Z","Fear...is power.","This set has always been one of my favourites next to Arkham Asylum. It has a good amount of pieces for $29.99 CAN, and is a much cheaper way to get the Scarecrow. The Batcopter is cool, but come on, the real reason anyone bought this thing is for the bi-plane. I love the bi-plane. I don't know what it is, but it just really goes with the Scarecrow's style. I don't like that the bomb bay only holds one bomb, and the gun rack is in an odd position. Plus, why does Scarcrow NEED guns? He already has a scythe! You can't decapitate a minifig with a tommy gun, can you? Other than that, perfect.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-05-31T14:02:37.383Z","Batcopter Review","<p>This was one of&nbsp;the last Batman themed sets I got and put together. Next to set 7782: The Batwing and Joker's Copter, this set if very comparable. Another aerial set of vehicles for the Batman theme. Like all of the Batman themed LEGO sets, it's either the vehicles or the featured villians that's a draw and I feel that this set serves very well for both draws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're unable to afford the Arkham Asylum set, this is the other, more comparably cheaper set that retailed about $30 when it first came out; in which to pick up the Scarecrow minifigure. The Batman minifigure in this set is the blue suited one, ala Adam West Batman from the 60's. As he features in nearly every Batman themed set, he can get a bit redundant despite different custome variations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Batcopter looks very sleek and well designed for functionality and the batman theme/design. There's a forward set of machine gun/laser turrents on the Copter and the cockpit is fully enclosed, giving the appearance of being well armored. It truely looks good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scarecrow's bi-plane that he flies. At first I thought I'd be rather blah about it. But as I worked on assembling it, I found myself rather taken with it. The only hard I have are the bombs the plane drops out, they don't stay in very well unless you're planning to have them drop right away during play. I can't help but want to go build a brick barn and have Scarecrow go do some barn storming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like many of the Batman sets, I've greatly enjoyed having this in my collection. As the theme has been out of production for the past few years, any sets available have seen a sky rocketing rise in price leaving it that only the hard core collectors and those with money to spend being the one's who can get this until LEGO and DC work out any future liscensing deals &amp; agreements for sets.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Knightwing01","2016-06-12T20:29:41.583Z","My favorite bat man set I own","<p>I got this set on eBay for 105 dollars (a&nbsp;great deal if I do say so myself) and was surprised that I found it was a good value for money</p>

<p>It includes several stickers and rare parts and had lots of great nostalgia</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It includes the rare adam west batman and scarecrow so over all the municipal are the main reason to buy this set</p>

<p>Pretty fun</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Love the batcopter not crazy about scarecrows by plane but it&#39;s pretty nice build to include</p>
