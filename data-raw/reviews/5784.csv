That said its quite good for its price and also there are plenty of extras in there as well like bane and the riddler hence the 3. It also looks quite sturdy and the weapon can come off so its good for converting to other jobs like star wars ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-08-16T01:51:45.27Z","Now that I own this...","...It totally rocks! Frankly, I wasn’t all that interested in this set to begin with, especially since the current retail version lacks the cool base we saw in the prototype. However, I found the set to be infinitely cooler than I expected and was definitely a great buy. My Dad got it for me almost immediately, so I’m very grateful for that. Seems he liked the idea of a Bat-tank as well.

	The box design is one I’ve never seen before, with folding flaps that close it off properly after opening. There are also, very sadly indeed, no alternate models suggested, not even in the instruction booklet. Speaking of the booklet, the instructions are clear enough and in an improved design. In fact, they are almost paranoid: what with notices not to play with the sets on grass, or to mix up the packs. The piece packets are arranged according to the building steps, which is a pretty helpful move, I suppose.

	The minifigs in this set are pretty amazing, including a blue-suited Batman, the Riddler with his jetpack and the steroid-pumped Bane. The paint-detailing on Bane is absolutely stunning, with the back of the minifig torso and head printed in impressive detail. I was also skeptical about whether Lego would be able to pull off a decent-looking bluish Batsuit, but the dark blue colour chosen worked very well. The utility belt is in an interesting golden colour which shines quite neatly. Good going there.

	Let’s move on the villains’ vehicles. The Riddler’s jetpack is compact and in a realistic design, without using any particularly special parts too. It is more practical but not as cool as the flying platform put forward in the prototype, but still works for me. Bane’s motorcycle is macho and a little intimidating, though it looks a tad thrown-together. However, it is still sufficiently sturdy. The main features are the decently-designed weaponised sidecar. Not bad at all, I suppose. There is also a clip included to hold Bane’s weapon while he’s driving the bike, a great touch.

	As for the titular hideout, it has been famously reduced to but a gate. Even though the design is far from impressive, it is still fairly decent compared to “Add-ons” from other Batman sets. Cute stickers are included too. However, since Bane and the Riddler are two of the more intelligent villains from Batman’s rouges gallery, I can’t help but wonder why they would resort to such childish methods. There is also a pretty nice “Wanted” poster for Bane pasted onto the outside pillar. Even though it is a great touch, it should have been pretty obvious to whoever posted that notice that Bane is hiding just inside! 

There is also a presumable rust-coloured chain included, which is very unique but can’t help but appear like wood. The metal gates are also an odd pearl-colour, unlike the uneven rust-colour version in the instructions which may have worked better. As for the accessories included for the villains in the hideout, the dynamite sticks and detonator are not as realistic as the previous versions, especially since the detonator has the odd appearance of a wooden block. There are also only two $100 “bank-notes” included in the set, which is a meager amount to be stealing for two supervillains. Maybe the rest was wired to their Swiss bank accounts. But who am I to criticize: at least we get two of those now-rare pieces. There is also a canister marked “Danger” – perhaps it contains the Venom drug Bane uses? It is the simplest but my favourite of the accessories provided for the villains. The spotlight and chain gun that top it all off are a little awkward – I would have preferred there being just two spotlights instead. Anyway, this is still a serviceable side attraction.

Now, for the star of this set: the bulky but sleek and very formidable Bat-tank! As my memory serves me, there never really was a “Bat-tank” in any versions of the Dark Knight’s story. However, this would have been useful in the No Man’s Land storyline, in which Gotham was ravaged by an earthquake. The design is fairly realistic and workable in real life. The threads used to move the tank around are very cool, taking 158 individual parts out of the 645 in the set to assemble! This is by far the best and coolest feature in the set, because it really  functions like a real tank would. The tank threads are made out of a softer but still strong plastic, so as not to scratch surfaces easily. The side paneling is very detailed in armour, though a tad too complicated. A nicely-designed sticker adds some detail.

Unfortunately, the design of the cockpit is poor. It is not hinging, and there is also a very odd seating position for Batman himself. The controls are also recycled off from Star Wars sets, being far too futuristic and more suitable for spaceflight in appearance. There is also no space to store Batman’s gadgets, unlike in some other Bat-vehicles Lego has produced. There are also poor connections for the underside of the craft, and a rather awkward weapons array. It is too bulky, and makes use of the terribly ineffective “push-fire” missiles. Thankfully though, it also employs the very cool it-really-works missile launcher, in a new less threatening but more high-tech design. 

All in all, the Bat-tank is not the best Bat-vehicle Lego has produced, but is still extremely interesting and really cool in its own right. Even without a proper base, the set as a whole is still a great package, especially with the wonderfully-designed minifigures thrown in. The price is quite intimidating, so do get it on sale as my Dad wisely did. I can safely say it is really not as bad as the Lego fan community – and even myself - initially made it out to be.

RATING: 8/10 STARS

"_add_um","2008-02-12T11:32:37.687Z","QUITE GOOD","Overall it a pretty good set, the most disapointing part of it was the &quot;hideout&quot; which was more of a flimsy gate and also there is no storage compartment for the weapons unlike the batmobile. But on the good side you get nice minifigs, 2 of them are new: (a blue suited Batman and Bane) the other minifig (riddler) was only seen in limited set (arkham) and was (well not my knowledge anyway) released in europe. Once again stickers were put into the set which I dislike because they eventually peel off. The Bat-Tank is the best part about the set (and was probaly influenced the Tumbler in Batman Begins) and has a firing missle and the flick missles (which I also dislike because they fall out easily). Riddler comes with a jet pack and bane has a all new motorcycle with some kind of side-car gun. Also inculdes 2 money pieces with 100$ on it, dynaamite and a barrel with danger on it (probaly bane's venom suppily)  Heres pros and cons.

pros:
* Bat-tank well made
* firing missle
* rare minifigs
* new bike

cons:
* flick missles
* hideout (or gate) 
* storage for weapons 

Overall I like it but has a lot of flaws. But goes great with the Batcave and other sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"water_jedi_17","2008-01-29T20:32:56.043Z","a bit ok","This set has a blue batman which I really like especially with the blue cape. Riddler is the same but his jetpack is not very stable since it spins a lot. Bane has a nice design and his motorcycle is sort of good. What I hated was that the fence was the 'hideout'. I hoped it was a bit larger. The bat tank is excelllent but the missil often comes out when I lift it.The acessories are perfect since they are very realistic.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2008-06-27T12:25:14.31Z","it should never have been called a hideout.","yes, where is the hideout? other than its inappropriate set name, this batman set is really cool to have!

the bat-tank looks awesome, intimidating and ready to crush anything in its path! i like the way in which all the technic parts have been intelligently utilized and completely obscured from view. it also fits in perfectly with all the other earlier batman vehicles, including the batmobile, batwing and bat-sleigh from the batcave.

so what about the gate? well, why not change out all the 2-3 green bricks to dark grey or black ones, minus all the (&quot;no bats allowed&quot; and &quot;wanted&quot;) stickers, and then place it outside the batcave? the batcave needs a gate, and here is one big one to serve just that purpose! i am sure bane won't mind... lol!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-10T11:40:23Z","&quot;I gotta get me one of those.&quot;","The Bat-Tank seems to be very much in the mold of the Batmobile from &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; or &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. This is one of my favourite Bat-vehicles because back in '07, this was the closest thing to the Tumbler. I got this at a TRU in Victoria back in August of '07 and I was NOT disappointed.

Pros:
Bane is exclusive to this set
Bat-Tank is larger than one would think
MONEY!
Bane's motorbike is neat
$79.99 CAN seems reasonable for 645 pieces
I like the chain gun and searchlight on the gate

"sudorum","2008-11-19T17:26:33.607Z","Bane","The real reason I acquired this set was not for the Bat tank, but for the two new minifigures: Bane and the blue suited batman. This set comes with a multitude of accessories; the best is Bane's dark green motorcycle. However, it's kind of ridiculous that lego considers a gate and two watchtowers a hideout. At least the bat tank can be called a tank. Another con to this set would be the flick- fire missiles, which now dominate all the star wars and bat man sets. They're completely useless, and the only thing they serve to do is aggravate people.",FALSE,4,4,4,3,3
"TheDarkKnight","2008-12-10T14:16:00.03Z","LEGO Dropped the Ball with This Set","The only reason I bought this set was for the minifigures. Really.

Pros:
A (?)tankish(?) vehicle, but the Tumbler is much better.
Bane's motorcycle, the best part of this set.
Nice explosives and things. Good nick-nacks to have.
Standard Bat-Weapons

Cons:
Bat-Tank's cockpit is easily broken and hard to fix.
No hinge, you have to remove glass to place in minifigure.
You really, honestly call this a hideout in your right mind?
Riddler's Jet Pack is horrible, twisting and turning all the time.

Really not a very good set at all, unless you sprout money, or REALLY want the minifigs, just buy the Tumbler instead.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

AMAZING SET. Bat-tank is better then I thought it would be!&nbsp;Treads&nbsp;don't fall off of it for me (Yet). The Gate is Awesome with its guns and Light. Gate is real ""Smashing""! Blue Batman is really cool! Bane (The Original) is an exclusive mini-figure to this set. He really got me even more pumped up for TDKR. Riddler is cool too! Jet pack&nbsp;swivels&nbsp;to much though.

"AETerry","2010-08-13T13:34:03.25Z","Riddler & Bane's Hide Out ","<p>Yeah, like many others who've reviewed this set, I got the set for the minifigs and wanting all/most of the batman sets.</p><p>The main feature of this set is of course the Bat Tank and for me, getting the villian minifigures of Bane and Riddler.</p><h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are in booklet form, following LEGO's step-by-step illustrations.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4>There's a total of 645 pieces in this set, most of which go for building the Bat Tank before any other builds in this set.<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get three minifigures in this set. Bane, Riddler and Batman. Batman is found in nearly all of the Batman sets. Though this is the set to get if you're looking for Bane and Riddler does feature again in the Arkham Asylum set.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>As stated before, the main build/feature of this set is the Bat Tank and it's pretty good, my biggest complaint with it though is the treads are always coming undone with just the slightest bit of casual play.</p><p>Bane and his motorcycle are the best features of this set. I liked the little bit of a build for this and seeing this big muscle bound brute have a little more he can do than just brute force.</p>



<p>Riddler's not too bad to have if you can get past the jetpack twisting on you. There's a one piece jetpack build from the Classic Space era that's better and newer models show how a jet pack can be build that doesn't twist on you.<br></p>My other biggest complaint with the set is this is not a hide out, it's a set of Gates and a couple vehicles.
 Maybe calling it Bane &amp; Riddler's Showdown would have been better.<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>Still, the set is very good and worth getting if you were able to. Bat Tank for Batman's fleet of vehicles he seems to have. Just like his utility belt, he'll have a vehicle for nearly all occasions. There are plenty of little knick knacks like the dynamite and detonation device, Riddler's jetpack, money pieces and Bane's motorcycle.</p><p>As someone collecting up Batman sets, I'd still get this set as it's worth the original $50 to me of having picked up.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,3
