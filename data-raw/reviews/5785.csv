The tracks look good in dark grey (they looked better in old dark grey with the conductive metal surface), although the switching lever maintains it's current yellow colour - would look better in black in my opinion.

The box it came in was, as usual, too big for the contents - obvious marketing ploy, but it just encourages me to purchase less sets due to the bulk.

I am pleased with how TLC have given us the RC train units with cheaper tracks. My review of 4531 included a wish for this.

I think now that TLC could drop the clip-together tracks (I assume they used this to get a good electrical connection) and go back to joining the tracks together with 8x2 plates.

I'm now anticipating a three-way point to be released, and hope for more track layout accessories in the future.
