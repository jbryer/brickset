"Gert_Jan","2007-05-20T10:28:19.603Z","Verry nice","This is a verry good set. With mega lasers and a firing missile it has superb weapons. The wings can be moved and the jetpack is detachable. It can stand good because it had 2 large pilars on the back of the jetpack. But why does the jetpack need to be controled by the battle machines hands?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-01T23:21:18.123Z","Good for its price point","This set is probably one of the best I've purchased in the Exo-Force line to-date.  It reminds me very  much of the Dendrobium from Gundam 0083 and the Meteor from Gundam Seed, which is a good thing.  The whole look of it is very nice and the massive engines do provide the look of speed as do the various fins.  However the weight of the engines might become and issue on the rotary joint depending on how much you move them, how much support they have when displayed, and how tight the joints are when assembled.  The weapons are also very impressive lending an air of power to the unit though the top-mounted missle has a very sensitive trigger and seems to fire on the slightest touch.  Also the ability for the battle machine to use the left-hand weapon is nice and helps supply the under-armed machine some fire-power should it need it.

The battle machine itself is rather nice.  It has a lot of possability and has a good self ratio so nothing looks out of proportion as compared to other battle machines.  I would have liked though if they had integrated the waist-swivel found in the white lightning into it to increase its possability.  Also I'd have prefered a larger battle machine and booster pack to allow for the larger units to be able to link up to it instead of just the current small asortment.  My final gripe would be the lack of a hand weapon meant strictly for the battle machine so that you can use them seperetly with out removing a weapon from the booster unit.

I'd have given this set a 5 had the joints been firmer (some of mine are weak compared to other sets I've gotten) and the battle machine slightly bigger.  But overall should you see this set and colelct Exo-force I highly recomend it for ones colelction or for just the possibility of adapting it for the larger machines.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"pythonkid","2007-06-02T01:15:23.84Z","I must say, I like it. ","Overall, this is a very cool looking set. I actually OWN this set too.  The adjustable wings and fins are a great add on. The hands on the booster seem a little much though. I also hate the large peices. Overall, i don't think its worth $30 but it is still a great set. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-03-02T18:18:30.17Z","Well Done","This set is visually cool, but don't be deceived by the CGI tech. Let's start with the cockpit: It's just another Cyclone Defender, minus weapons and change colours, 3/5.
The jet: Gigantic, very cool, but it's too heavy for the battle machine to stand straight.4/5
The weapons: The double rifle were good, the missile launcher is excellent, with gun-type shooting mode, but the hyper blaster can sometimes fall easily4/5
So, I rate this set 4/5 and I recommend you to buy it while it's still in your toy shop.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"gome4","2009-08-27T09:29:20.247Z","ha-ya-to's best mech ","this set is great i would highly recommend it

pros 
realistic flaps
guns
the handle(it feels like the handle of a gun)
the trigger for the missile launcher is like the trigger of a gun
detachable body
cool fingers(i like punching the lights out of claw crusher)
the gun can detach from the jet pack and go on the blue mechs hand
cons
one tap of the trigger can set it off, which is annoying if you are trying 2 fix it
the jet pack is to heavy, so if you want it to stand, then you have to put the outside jetpacks facing down",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
