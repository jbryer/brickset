Its carpet red and white colors bring the tower a finished touch! But b efore that..the tower has a cannon at the top which is handy, a new Hikaru minifig w/ swords, nice Chinese/Exo-Force banners and sweet stickers. I will admit..the robot machine sucks even though it has TWO cannons! Overall, a nice addition to any *sucker's collection!* *Just kidding! I'm gonna buy it! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"CyandraZ","2008-05-08T16:09:30.78Z","One of the best Exo-force kits of 2007","Attack on the Golden Tower was really the highlight of the 2007 summer sets, despite also being the most normal. While the Mobile Devastator, the Areo Booster, and the Combat Crawler X2 all tried to explore new concepts in vehicle design (with very mixed success), the golden tower went for a tried and true formula – a playset with a building and a vehicle.

The vehicle included with the Golden Tower, the Sonic Raven is in a sense Sonic Phantom 2.0, despite the construction being totally different. However, the Sonic Raven is still far different – the cockpit is at the front, the 2 engines are at the back and face forward, there are two launchers instead of one, and the color scheme is brighter - to name a few differences. Many people think this is really just a flying gun, and they are right, but I don’t view that as a negative, especially since this is Exo-Force. The Sonic Raven to me is really a nice upgrade from the Phantom, and a decent kit in its own right.

The Golden Tower is a whole different story. Taking influences from Japanese architecture, the tower has two floors and a top mounted launcher, lots of projecting points, and a nice color scheme combining white, dark red, and a bit of gold. The interior is nothing special – just a code computer on level one and a training dojo on level two, but I like that it’s not over the top. The detail level is very nice and the design is very well though out – although a few of the play features are a bit strange (the opening door with the missiles on the back comes to mind).

The Attack on the Golden Tower may be one of the best parts packs of 2007. Besides the obvious golden fins, there is a ton of dark red slopes, lots of black curves and basic white bricks, and some interesting detail pieces in the Tower and the Sonic Raven (the code computer box and golden katanas are especially neat). The figures are limited – just a Devastator robot and Hitomi, but Hitomi herself is awesome for being the first and only female minifig in Exo-Force. However, I believe TLC should have included at least one or two other minifigs, as two is really low for a 50 dollar set.

The Attack on the Golden Tower really is a nice set, and it’s a shame that it apparently did not do well in sales. True, there are flaws, mainly the low amount of figures and some strange play features, but the kit is overall well designed, and an amazing parts pack as well. Whether you are an Exo-force fan, a constant Moc’er, or just a normal lego fan, the Golden Tower is a great kit. 4.5/5

"bmwlego","2007-11-10T12:07:50.013Z","My First Exo-Force Set Provided Hours of Building Fun (If I was a kid I would have a lot more fun playing with this set too)","I bought this set on clearance for 75% off so I couldn't resist buying it even though I am not an Exo-Force fan. Now that I have built this set I can see why this line is so popular. The instructions as usual were easy to follow. When I opened the box, 2 thoughts popped in my head:
1-why does LEGO just throw the instruction booklets in the box? My instructions came rolled up and bent, as if I had slept on them!
2-That's it? A long, tall box and this is all I get? I know that LEGO has to make their toys seem as big as other toys so they package their products in boxes that are much larger than they need to be but this is very misleading.

The stickers are gold foiled. They look great.

The minifigs are fine to me. I don't care for the anime styled face features on the human fig but that is to be expected with this line. The robot fig is not bad either.

The Golden Tower is as tall or taller when compared to LEGO buildings such as the fire department or police headquarters from the 1980's sets. The color scheme is attractive and the gold grill pieces are cool. The dark red slopes that make up the roof overhangs are new to my collection. The corner slopes I have never seen before in any color, never mind a rare color such as dark red. The action features for the tower are cool such as the firing cannon and opening door that works almost like a drawbridge. The chain link fence pieces are great (they make up the door on the 1st floor and 2nd floors). The gold helicopter blades at the top look cool and add height as well. The structure itself is wide open but sturdy. The top layer is resting on top of tiles so it can be removed easily to gain access to the 2nd floor.

The Sonic Raven flying ship is cool. It's turbines spin with the use of Technic parts and gears. The turbines themselves look stressed (gray is showing through the painted black). The firing cannons are really cool. New fire parts add detail to the rear of the machine. The parts that hold the turbines connect to the body of the Sonic Raven using bracketed parts so they can be raised up and down. The top-rear of the Raven has what can only be described as large mud guard parts that are yellow and I can't wait to use these to build a larger scale car. My favorite newer part is also included, yep there are 4 yellow cheese slopes! 

The Sonic Raven's base and underside look like a gun and thanks to the cannons and their firing mechanism, this is something that can easily be built using this set.

"peppermintmecha","2008-09-13T16:50:14.747Z","Decent Set, Could do with a Mecha.","Well, I bought this set today, mainly for the minifig (seeing as I won’t be getting her piloting a mech) I was pleasantly surprised by what a great set this is. Two A4 instruction books, five large bags, a sheet of stickers and two large “boosters” loose in the box. It took me around 45 minutes to build. 
The Robot Ship
This ship has the nice feature of two trigger activated torpedo launchers and a useful handle and trigger mechanism. The moving wings are a nice touch. Two complaints with this one: The large “boosters” (or whatever they are) look a little unfinished without propellers or some sort of greeble over the connection and the trigger mechanism that sets off the missiles is a little twitchy, so there are missiles flying all over the place if you hold the model wrong. The robot is a basic silver one and the cockpit is a nice size with stickers applied to create control panels. All in all it’s an ok battle machine/jet but a second robot would have been nice, considering the high price tag.
The Tower
The tower is excellent. Modular construction makes it easy to assemble and even turn into separate units, the omnidirectional torpedo launcher in the top tier has great aiming ability. The computer/vault is nice looking (even though some of the stickers are a little hard to apply) and the cog controlled door is a cool addition. The roof of two of the modules was a little complicated to assemble correctly, but the 1:1 scale image in the instruction book helps to get it just right. Only one complaint with this one, the minifig. In the additional comic book at the back of the instruction booklet (and the online comic) Hitomi is shown in a purple jumpsuit/pilot suit however in the set she has black legs, all fine and good until you remember that Sir Danju had purple legs. I changed my fig using a pair, so that minor problem is solved for me. 
Over all this is a great set and the brick count makes it worth it. It would have been nice to have had a purple battle machine, even if it was an Uplink or Cyclone Defender sized one, a second robot would have been good too. However, it is a brilliant set and a great addition to any Lego collection.

The Tower:
The tower is very well-armed but not fully fleshed-out. I like the missile launcher on the roof and the hidden missiles on the inside of the door, as well as the abundance of swords. What I don't like is the somewhat empty ground floor with just the safe and not much else. They could have added some large computer screens and a small mech. Another thing is the removable training floor which is too small and could have been replaced by some more computers or armaments. This portion scores 3/5.

The Battle Machine:
Due to my intense roasting of the tower, it may sound like I hate this set, rest assured, I don't. The battle machine makes up for the towers faults. The adjustable, moving turbines are neat as are the huge flames. What I don't like is how the missile launchers are attached by a single firing mechanism, and how poorly they're attached to the machine itself. The robot is very neat and thankfully, the cockpit actually has CONTROLS. 4/5

Really tiny (compared to the comics)
Only has one code
