Blazing Falcon

Blazing Falcon is Ryo's new mech. its similar in size to the golden guardian. its actually larger than blade titan and sky guardian. ITs colors are lacking. Dark grey, white orange, light grey, gold..... seems kind of thrown together as far as colors go. I'm sure this thing would look cool in black and silver though. The gold hands are kind of out of place as well. Silver again sould have been better. The cockpit is designed just like the ones on the sky guardian and blade titan. Finally, yes, there is waste articulation (HA! TOLD YA SO!). The waist articulation makes it very poseable. One problem you would have is how stubby his arms are due to some peices taking away from the movement. its a real easy fix though. 

overall 4/5 due to colors

Mobile Devastator

For starters, i must say, this thing is big. It is at least two feet long, and nearly a foot wide. For starters, let me say how the building process is:

step 1) Build the &quot;frame&quot;. You start out, building a very large rectangular frame. its a 3D frame, and kind of resembles a very empty box. 

step 2) the axels. The axels are very large, and help fill this frame a little, though they go on the front and back. The axels have some articulation so the beast can turn. kinda. it sucks at turning. luckily all it really has to do is go in a straight line. 

step 3) build the human torture devices/pods! actually, a very small assembly. you attach this to the outside of the &quot;Frame&quot; using technic pins.

step 4) the walls. basically, you build more floorspace, followed by a wall, and a ceiling. the ceiling stores iron drones, and can fold down to &quot;deploy&quot; them. these snap on using technic pins too. after you have these on, it looks like more than an empty frame; it looks like an empty frame with walls. 

step 5) build the top head. the top head is basically just a starwars cockpit, with two of the Blade Titans guns on either side. Behind it, are two pretty decent mini plane things. 

setp 6) zamor sphere launcher construction. Probably my least favorite thing on this set. the zamor launchers seem pretty much thrown on there, and even get in the way of other workings of the set. luckly, they are just thrown on there, and are easily removed. 

step 7) the head. same as the top head, just a little smaller. 

congrats, now you have the mobile devastator! It has travel mode, battle mode, can deploy a total of 6 troops, has two miniplanes, and has an insane amount of firepower including two zamor launchers! Inside you will find prison pods, as well as human torture devices!

review time. 

This thing is big. super big. however, big doesn't always mean good. though big, the set is very empty. the wall/platfor things you add only cover about half of each side. the rest of it, have huge holes you can see right through. these &quot;holes&quot; (4 total) are 10 studs long, and about 15 studs high. The inside, other than the two heads, mainly consists of 4 prison pods, which are easily removed. remove those, and its completely empty. There is so much room in it, that if you remove the prison pods, you can fit FOUR claw crushers inside of it. 

Now if you were to keep the top head thing lowered, and keep the sides closed up, it doesn't look too bad (if you ignore those 4 huge holes). But once you open it up, you see that empty frame, that you started with at the beginning of the set, with just some stuff attached to it. This set is pretty much &quot;big&quot; for the sole purpose of being &quot;big&quot;. The &quot;bigness&quot; doesn't add anything. If lego used the same number of peices, but made it more compact, i think it could have looked a lot better. 

While designing it, i think they forgot to design a back for it. the rear is just the back of your &quot;frame&quot; with the axel attached. 

now, don't get me wrong. it is still a cool set, but it had a ton of potential, but instead its like a junglegym box with wheels. 

Another funny thing, is zamor launchers aside, this thing can only shoot forward. in fact, it even lacks the ability to aim up and down. The only weapon that has any movement is the zamor launchers, and they have barely anything. Though it has powerful weapons, it has a very big blind spot right in front of it (if the mech is short enough COUGHCYCLONEDEFENDERCOUGH), it can't shoot to the sides very well, and it has nothing that can shot anything behind it. Also, say its in battle mode, and the top head thing is stuck way in the air. Where it used to rest, there is like a landing platform. should say, aero booster land on that, there are no weapons that can point in that direction to hit it.

I rate this set 3/5, due to horrible colors (green on yellow on red), and the &quot;emptiness&quot; of the entire set.

The Mobile Devastator is actually two sets in one. The main chunk of the set is the giant rolling robot doomwheeler, the second is the light Exo-Force mech Blazing Falcon. Minifigs are certainly not lacking here with the Exo-Force pilot Ryo, Mecha One, three Devastator robot pilots, six Iron Drones, and two skeletons. At $90 US this is a very big and expensive set, but is it worth all that?

Starting with the Blazing Falcon, the Exo-Force mech is nearly as big and complex as the standard mech, but a little lighter and slimmed down, very similar to the White Lightning (from set 7713). The build is clean and simple and without too many stickers. When you’re done you have a very nice battle machine with a pair of wicked looking claws. The colors on this mech are well executed; this year’s design philosophy of white mechs with a secondary color is well represented here with white and orange with a little gold tossed in for flair. As mentioned, the stickers are kept to an acceptable number with the word “Hunt” appearing in Japanese lettering on the left leg-wing.

Articulation on the Blazing Falcon is fantastic, especially with the pivot point in the waist. The firing cannon on top is a nice touch of firepower to what looks essentially like a brawling mech. The claws (taken from the Bionicle Barraki Ehlek 8902) are a nifty and welcome addition to this battle-frame. Its nice to see a mech that looks like it could rip an enemy to metal shavings instead of just blasting it at range. 

The Blazing Falcon isn’t perfect though. As with pretty much every Exo-Force mech, the backside is almost totally devoid of detail. The placement of the jump-rockets on the insides of the legs is shaky, and the arm claws would look better if attached with a slightly shorter axle piece. All that being said, it’s a great looking and solidly designed mech, a great addition to the line.

The Mobile Devastator is sort of along the lines of last year’s Striking Venom (7707) in that LEGO has taken a few long beams and small pieces and concocted a HUGE vehicle out of them. Building the Mobile Devastator is actually a pretty fun experience with almost no frustrating moments. Most of the time it feels like you’re constructing a building and not a rolling war machine. 

The finished piece is basically a framework with everything tacked on. The colors are the basic robot hues of black and bright green and there are quite a few stickers to add details to the smooth surfaces. From certain angles it looks like a crazy collection of loose parts, but thankfully it looks dangerous and menacing from many others. The construction is very solid and thoughtfully designed. The main wheels themselves are affixed VERY securely and it would take quite a bit of work to even purposefully yank one free. Two large gray wheels built into the middle of the frame and hidden from view support most of the model’s weight. This also leaves the larger green wheels more freedom to turn and bank so that you can roll the set across the carpet in play.

And speaking of play, this vehicle sure does pack in the play features. In addition to the moveable wheels, the sides flip down to deploy Iron Drone robots and, supposedly, to become a robot base. LEGO has made quite a few vehicle-to-base sets and they usually have more detailed interiors then this set does. I think the “base” designation was just tacked on by the marketing team afterwards. Inside the hull are a pair of green bubbles, two of which contain Minifig skeletons under some kind of devices. I’m still not sure if this sort of thing is meant to imply that the robots are using the humans to power their mega-machines, but it’s an interesting (and ghoulish) prospect.

The aft end of the piece has a sort of command pod, which can be raised or lowered easily. Mounted on either side of the pod are a pair of ball launchers (Zamor launchers from Bionicle) that can fire at enemy mechs. The launchers seem excessive and just feel like LEGO trying to get a little more mileage out of a bad gimmick. Above those is the main pod itself, which is flanked by a pair of gattling cannon and detachable robot fighters. The fighters are really neat and will appeal to any classic Space theme fans. Just detach the fighters, flip down their wings, and their built-in Devastator pilots are ready to wreak havoc on Exo-Force. (If you’re wondering where their legs are, look inside the base doors) 

With several cannon, detachable fighters, and deployable troops, the Mobile Devestator is quite the piece of equipment and a fairly decent set. If the set seems a little thin, it’s because it is. After you’re finished building you’re surprised that there’s not more to it. The whole machine could use a few more parts to bulk it up despite the stable design. In the end the whole set just barely shakes out as worth the price tag. It is a good set, but I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who is on a limited LEGO budget or wants something more challenging. For Exo-Force enthusiasts and fans of big vehicles, it’ll be a welcome addition to the collection. 

Personally I give it a solid 4 out of 5 rating. Now I just have to figure out where I’m going to display this monster!

"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-24T14:36:22.53Z","DESTROY! DESTROY!","I got this set last Christmas and I knew it was going to be awesome as soon as I tore off the wrapping paper. My cousin IMMEDIATELY asked me if he could put it together with me. I put it together when I got home, because it would have been difficult to transport the entire finished product back from Saltspring Island, and this thing is AMAZING! It comes with the ultimate robot harbringer of doom, better than the Striking Venom! There is also an average-sized mech for Ryo. The Blazing Falcon is a little slimmer than regular mechs, but it's the same height. This set is PACKED with minifigs including Ryo, Meca one, SIX Iron Drones, three Devastators, and two skeletons. If you want an army of pilots and robots, then all you need is this and a couple human sets. The Mobile Devastator has wheels that can crush the 2006 Gate Assault set and the sides fold out to reveal the mass of robot forces. There are also two detachable scout flyers, Bionicle Zamor launchers, chain guns, and a cockpit for Meca One thats folds down to compact the vehicle.

Pros:
can't complain about the number of minifigs
comes with Meca One!
only set I have that includes Ryo
This thing is FLIPPIN' HUGE!
works well with Fight for the Golden Tower",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
