"Johan_van_den_Heuvel","2007-05-26T17:37:29.15Z","Castle!!... :)","Found this set in a local toy store today. Just needed to pick it up.
It reminded me a lot of set 6012, which i had as a child. :)
The cost was just 4,95 EURO, 7 USD. The price in the USA will probably be lower, due to lego exchange rates. 

pros:
-two real cool knights
-silver helmets!
-working balista
-real cool white skelleton knight (not black as in the photo)
-a white skelleton horse :)
-nice simple shooting mechanism
-potential army building set

cons:
-not much to build, but that really didnt bother me. 

Conclusions:
Finally new sets of 80s and 90s style knights! Just puts a smile on my face. :)
The new white skelleton knight is realy, realy cool. I would advice this set to anyone who likes the Castle theme. Nice set with 3 cool minifigs for 4,95 EURO!! need i say more?... ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Deinonychus","2007-06-08T17:39:02.763Z","Upon a pale horse...","Crossbow Attack is the smallest of the new Castle sets. This 54 piece set sells for $6-$7 US and is essentially one siege weapon, three Minifigs, and a horse. So what does this small collection of bricks really have to offer?

The main portion of the set, the wheeled crossbow, is a simple little piece that takes no time at all to assemble. It comes in the basic medieval weapon colors of gray, black, and brown with a little dark blue and gold tossed on to mark it as part of this new King’s forces. A pair if Minifig crossbows are also mounted to the weapon, presumably for the gunners to use when their artillery piece fails. A rubber band firing mechanism is mounted to the rear and is used to hurl the axle and ball projectiles a little over two feet…if you’re lucky. It seems a pretty pointless little toy with very little oomph or play value, but it will certainly look good sitting outside the King’s Castle or in the courtyard.

The main draw of this set is actually the Minifigs. The soldiers in the set are totally different in every aspect, so there’s no repeat-figure syndrome here. In addition to the crossbows on the main weapon, the set has an axe for one of the figures, and they both have nice new silver helmets. The undead skeleton warrior comes with the newly redecoed head and improved arms with horizontal grip. He’s armed with a skeleton army shield and a scythe-blade sword that looks truly wicked. In addition to all this, he comes with a skeletal mount. The undead horse is a single molded piece with no articulation. Articulation that’s hardly missed due to the sheer creepiness of having a horse skeleton LEGO piece. And despite what the “official” LEGO images have shown of the set, the skeleton and horse are indeed white and not black in color.

Adding all these elements up, this is a fairly decent set. There’s really not a lot to it building-wise, and you can’t get anything in this box that you can’t get in other sets, or for a better value. $6-$7 for 54 pieces is pushing it, and you’re much better off shelling out the extra money for one of the slightly larger sets like the Final Joust (7009) or Knight’s Catapult Defense (7091). I can’t even really recommend this set as a troop-builder, but if you’re planning on getting most or all of the new Castle sets, it’s still worth having for completion’s sake.

"lostcarpark","2007-06-24T20:19:23.013Z","Great little castle set","Although there isn't a lot in this set, it's just about perfect for a cheap introduction to Castle, as well as a part kit and army builder.

The minifigs are the set's biggest attraction. The two footsoldiers are both nice individually, but would look great in a regiment of each. A flaw with some similar sets in the past has been a combination of a footsoldier and an officer (or other figure that you don't need more than a few of), which means that you end up with lots of surplus figures. This set is good because everything is useful when you try to build armies. The set includes an axe and two crossbows (which are part of the catapult). It would be nice if there was a second hand weapon (axe/spear/sword) for army building.

I really like skeleton horseman (which is white, not black as shown in some prerelease pictures). I will miss the floppy arms of the old skeletons, but at the end of the day, if we want a menacing skeleton army, they have to be able to hold their arms out straight. The new arm piece is similar to the old droid arm (and I expect we will see them in forthcoming Star Wars sets), but is completly straight at the elbow, and the hand is a 90 degree angle to the shoulder, making it suitable for holding a sword. The scimitar and shield finish it off nicely. The horse is a single piece, and I especially like the way the legs are mimmicing the legs of a &quot;living&quot; Lego horse. It would have been nice if the neck was articulated, though.

I quite like the catapult/launcher. It is a very simple build, but it's nice to see a completely brick built weapon, with no falling back on spring loaded elements. It also contains quite a lot of useful pieces that won't go to waste if the set is used for army building. 6 dark blue cheesers immediately come to mind. The pair of cartwheels should also come in handy.

All in all, this set offers very good value for money, and I will be picking up a few more of them.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"kirk0007","2007-07-01T21:46:50.013Z","Magnificent!","With the KK2, I decided that lego would never make a good castle series again.  Boy, was I wrong!  While I was at TRU in Deptford, I found this.

1. What you get:
-One skeletal horse
-One white skeleton
-Two soldiers
-One ballista
-Two ballista missiles
-One axe, one scythe blade, one round shield, two crossbows
2. Skeletal horse
The horse is a single molded element.  It looks very cool, and it's stunning with the rider on it, but I'd like to see  just a little articulation.
3. Skeleton
The undead soldier looks like a classic skellie, but he's different in that his arms are of the sort used with Star Wars battle droids, except with the hands angled 90 degrees so that they can hold things.  Altogether an improvement on the original, floppy, smily-faced skeletons, this guy is sinister as well as poseable and is actually creepy.
4. Soldiers
There are two soldiers in this set, but sadly only weapons for one.  The first soldier (who carries the aforementioned axe) is very nice.  His head is that of a Lego city police officer, like the one with the light-up flashlight in that set, and his armor is refreshingly original.  His cone-shaped helmet is silver, and rivals his armor in its cool factor.  The second soldier has a face that I swear is an exact likeness of Sean Connery as James Bond!  His helmet is also chromed, and I like it better than the first one.  At first, I thought his armor was Viking, but it's actually new. The only problem is his defenselessness.
5. Ballista
Thank god this isn't a Bionicle gun like all the other ones in every other castle set.  This ballista  is fairly simple, and it isn't great, but meh,  neither was the real thing!
6. Ammo
Not much to say here.  It's a technic ball attached to a technic axle.
7. Weapons + Armor
The axe is regular old dark bley, unlike those onyx ones from KK2.  It fits in very well.  The scythe blade is brilliant.  It's totally new, and it's beautiful!  The blade looks like a huge scimitar and has one other feature...the pommel is a clip brick so it can be attached to a pole, thus creating the long-awaited Lego scythe!  The shield is new (at least to me) and also deserves some respect.  Thouch small, the design on it is very cool, and isn't a sticker (thank goodness).  Finally, the two crossbows are actually just part of the ballista, but can be removed and used as desired.

Overall, this is a beautiful, well designed set. 10/10 for me, and I plan to buy everything else in this line!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Blade","2008-07-13T12:58:39.84Z","Ballista Attack!","I have put off reviewing this model due to the number of reviews it already had and some of them are really good leaving me with very little to talk about without repeating everyone. 

Well firstly I want everyone to note that the skeleton and the skeletal horse are white, NOT BLACK. They were all made this way and the picture above was an advertising one we are using. If you are desperate for a black pair see set 7009 to get it cheaply. 

With this set you get 2x Soldiers, A Ballista, 2x Missiles, A new skeleton and A Skeletal Horse. Totalling 3 mini-figs one animal and one cart, not bad for $6.66 AUS.

The Ballista is basically a standard cart, with a small leaver, given tension by a rubber band. Very simple and very effective. The carts wheels are the larger wagon style and have duel crossbows mounted on the front. The Ballista uses many shades but I must say the dark blue pieces are very nice and the gold pyramid on the front is very cool. The missiles are just a six length of Technic rod with a ball on the end. Simple, easily make more if wanted or lost and nice to see LEGO gives you two.

The Kings Kastle II (KK2) guards are very well done as well. You can easily tell which is which but that they are clearly from the same team. The one that pushes the Ballista has a chain mail shirt with blue sleeves, dark grey pants and a silver, circular helmet. His face is quite detailed with stubble and a smirk.

The other is wearing a chain mail shirt, with a blue vest over it, grey sleeves, light grey pants and a silver helmet that flares out at the neck. His face is also quite detailed with slanting eyebrows and a look of disgust. He also has a single sided axe, which is one of my favourite weapons.

The skeleton looks the same at first glance but then you notice this face is allot more detailed than the original and looks very dark and evil. Then you notice something else is different. The arms are no longer connected by ball joints and all loose, but rather on pegs like the legs and on a slight angle for better articulation. The arms are now similar to the droids from Star Wars or the aliens from Mars Mission. He has a small round shield that is brow and silver, with a silver skull and a grey scythe, which looks fantastic. A must have for any armoury. 

The only weak point I can really find with this set is in the skeletal horse. The skeletal horse he rides looks quite creepy and fits in well, but personally I feel he could have had a bit more detail, mainly in the face. At this point it is just one solid piece with no articulation. A face mask or some form of eyes would have really finished this piece of the set off nicely. But hey overall a great idea and a great start.

Overall I feel this is one of the best impulse sets I have seen for a long time and I am sure most kids that love LEGO would have this by now. Excellent Aesthetics, great colours new pieces and revamped pieces are just some of the reasons why this is a great set. Personally I feel this set is an 8/10 or Excellent. If you don’t already own this model I would seriously recommend it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Nased","2007-10-19T05:56:32.373Z","Smallest but Fantastic set of the Castle Series","There are two problems with the picture. The skeleton should be white and the skeleton horse should be white too(instead of black). 

Putting that aside, this is the smallest(as of October 2007) set in the new Castle series. It cost me only $9.00SGD to to own this set. The price is good as I get 1 skeleton rider with the awesome scythe. the keleton rider has a small round skeleton shield too. The skeleton looks evil and it really represents the evil force. 

On the other side, there are two crown knights in this set. An archer and a warrior. The warrior is an axe man. He has one axe while the acher is in charge of firing the ballistic, the archer could take either of the crossbows mounted on the push cart should he wish to.

I like this set because I get 3 mini figures at a cheap price. the only thing that I would love to see is to give some shields and another melee weapon to the archer. That's just my personal preference. I prefer my knights to have at least one melee weappon and a shield each.

You get a giant sword and shield for the skeleton, and a battle axe.  On the crossbow there are two hand-held crossbows.

Many people have said that one knight does not come with a weapon.(the other one has an axe) And then they continue to say that he doesn't have a weapon because he man's the big crossbow.

- Cheapest way to get a skeleton rider. A white one unlike what is shown on the picture but it works well for me anyway.

The reason why I mentioned 7091 is better than this set is because the namesake part, the ballista, is not well-designed as the catapult. The elastic band thing is a nice try but it doesn’t look good. Why are there 2 crossbows on the sides? Are they supposed to fire automatically? It just doesn’t make any sense to me.

Plus+
     Great number of figures and they are only $1.50 each if the catapult is $2. The skeleton horseman is great. The crossbow-man has a very nice rare helmet and face. the catapult is well sized and is about as big as a cannon scaled to Lego size. I was not in favour of the skeleton horse when they came out but it is now part of the castle family and look much better than a normal one. It also has great compatibility as i will explain later.

Minus-
      The catapult must be modified by raising the elastic band to the notch in the grey trigger or bit in order to achieve better than 15 cm or 6 inches. When modified it shoots a large distance up to 60cm, 24 inches. Also the skeleton does not have a helmet and is white not black in Australia but that is excusable. 

Equals=
       A great small set, well priced, good number of men, nice siege weapon, and great playability.

Compatibility
             Two of this set goes well with a Final Joust for a beginner, 4 with a Kings castle siege makes a great set an one with Tower raid adds to the playability. Any more than two and you have a small army as I have 8 with almost fifty soldiers.

The ""crossbow"" works great, 2 knights are for army building, and the skeleton in my set was white (both the fig and the horse) which is better than black IMHO.<br><br>Only thing I could ask for is another shield for the knights.<br><br>I bought several, and if I could find them again, I would buy more because the price/army ratio is just great.",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"AETerry","2011-02-13T22:01:10.36Z","Crossbow Attack Review","<p>At $9.99, this wasn't a bad set to pick up. You got a good siege/battle field weapon with the crowbow launcher, 2 Castle Minifigures and a Black Skeleton on a Black Skeleton horse. Making it a good army builder. The main draw for me were all the new elements and accessories for army building. Nothing too outstanding, especially if you've been building and collecting a lot of Castle over the years. For those younger, this is a still a solid set and well worth picking up.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,4
