"superdave","2007-08-15T11:56:18.723Z","A Solid Set","I was surprised to find, as I built this set, that it is very sturdy. Many of the recent sets in other themes have had a flimsy or airy feel to them; this is not one of those sets. The catapult is surprisingly solid and has a good feel to it. The skeletons' barricade is small and slight, but presents a good-looking and fun feature for the set.

Overall, I was surprised with the quality of this set. If future entries in the Castle line are as solidly built and as entertainingly playful, then this will definitely be a line to collect.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Nased","2007-10-19T06:08:38.343Z","Bolster your Army!","This is a solid and sturdy set. It deserves a 10/10 more than any other small lego sets from the previous series in the 1990s.

Cost: $22.00SGD. I got a brand new set in mint condition.

Number of Figures: 4 (2 knights, 1 black skeleton, 1 white skeleton).

Extras: Big, Sturdy catapult that works quite well for the crown knights. A smaller outpost for the skeleton army.

Weapons: 1 of the crown knights holds a short sword while the other holds a spear. There are shields mounted on the catapult and the crown knights can &quot;pluck&quot; one each to defend themselves if need be. The evil black skeleton has a a flail and a small round shield. Behind the skeleton outpost/barricade, the white skeleton is camping behind the barrier with a large skeleton shield at the front and two spears sticking out. The white skeleton has a helmet and holds a crossbow.

This set has great playability and it is a great booster to increase the size of the armies of both forces. I like this set very much. LEGO have finally produced another great castle, medieval knight series again.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"millacol88","2008-01-30T11:26:11.2Z","Affordable! ","When I first saw this set,I wasn't going to buy it. I was originally going to get the final joust set when I realised this set had nearly double the pieces and it was the same price! So, I got this instead. The catapult is very well done and can throw short distances. The black stand that the skeleton stands on is simple but looks great. The minifigs are the best part of this set. It comes with 2 knights and 2 skeletons, and plenty of weapons. This set was definitely worth the money and the final result looks great.

Pros:
-catapult
-lots of weapons
-cheap

-none!

"Gus_263","2008-05-07T16:59:11.513Z","A 3,6 of 5 set","This is one of the newest castle sets. Is basically a catapult and a little(very small in comparison with the catapult) barricade. In all the new theme (this started in 2007), there are four species (dwarves and knights, skeletons and trolls), but these were splited in two sides. The storyline is poor, like on the mars mission, don't like the old sets, where had lots of different armies. The storyline too limits the color scheme, because the colors from knights(or also dwarves) are many blue, silver, golden and gray, to makes these colors represent one side and others the other side. 

The set have useful contents, but the building isn't the best. Starting from the barricade, this can moves some parts, and have too spears and a crossbow. But, this don't have many things to defense, and can't protect the skeletons. Why the name of the set is Knights' Catpult Defense if they are attacking? Also if combined with the bigger castle of the new subtheme, a catapult will only attacks, and this barricade, can't defends much. The barricade could be better, with bricks in the place of plates or if with this includes a tower, but don't, and the catapult too have it's errors. I have a set with the brown pieces on the side of the catapult, and these dismantles sometimes if without the pieces to keep this. Like on the set dwarves' mine, this system to launchs makes a bigger building, but for launchs, this isn't the best. Maybe if with systems like from the old subthemes this set could be better and the catpult could launchs better. 

From the contents, this isn't very an army builder, but have things from battles, like few shields on the barricade(the barricade need more shields, but this don't have)or the weapons, helmets and another pieces from knights and skeletons. The knights looks like be the same of many other sets and are now very used, being repeated. If with other knights (like from the old theme, that had too smiths, peasants, and too many types of knights and wizards or witches)or the old skeletons, that still in few sets(these are more scary, don't weird like those, from this set), a better lego scenery could be made. 

The wheels of the catpult are great, but another color could be placed in the place of the gold. The stone too is great, but in comparison with the barricade, this is very massive and destructive. The rotating parts of the catapult isn't very great or an innovation, but still good. The worst things here are the size of the barricade, the colors, the system to launch the catapult(this could be better also with the contents from this set), and the minifigures with details with the same color, with none original face of a lego or lego skelton, and the symbols from them(crown for the knihgts and a skull from the skeletons, very simple and obvious, great only for little childrens). For these reasons, this set deserves a 3,6 rate, or a 4.
It is recommended for fans of this new theme from castle or for who searchs for an army of knights and their massive vehicles or of few armored skeletons with little additions for battle. Also if you likes the colors of the set, that were used in few knights' kingdom sets. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

You get a few figures and a war machine for the good guys that does its thing pretty well. I like this better than the Crossbow Attack basically because the catapult is a lot bigger and sturdier, which makes for a better time all around. The skeleton's barricade is weak at best.

"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-07T13:35:29.747Z","FIRE!","This set is a very good little army builder and great as an add-on to a larger battle scene. The set comes with two knights and skeletons apiece, a mobile catapult, a small barricade, and several weapons. The catapult is good to have for your army because it is the only one in this line with wheels. It has one shield on each side that can be plucked off and used by the knights as well as two handles that can rotate and would supposedly be used to pull the arm of the catapult into position. (In reality they're just for show.) The barricade for the skeletons is small but sturdy and has two spears and a skeleton shield on the front.

Pros:
catapult fires far
one of the skeletons has a shield
white skeleton has a helmet and crossbow
both portions of the set can be used in other scenes
catapult can rotate 360 degrees

Cons:
nobody has anything to stand on",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The catapult actually rotates, which I did not know. The skeleton's barricade is pretty wimpy, and I think it would be better off without it, and maybe another skeleton.

I’d say it is a small set exceeding expectations. It is small because of the piece count but it has what it takes to be an extraordinary set:

- Well-designed catapult! It is big and life-like. It just looks like a real threat to any of the bad guys. Would have been better to have an extra 1 or 2 ammos (the big rock).
- It just serves the purpose of this set well – army building. 4 minifigs and good number of weapons are included.
- The flimsy barricade is standing helplessly waiting for its destiny to be crushed by the gigantic siege machine but it does contain some useful pieces like the joints and stuff. A couple of more of this would help build up a decent frontier defense line for 7093.
- One thing I am not satisfied with the set is the stand for the skellie at the back of the barricade because it falls off too often when I put the skellie on.

Overall, it is a great choice for army building with an extra bonus of big catapult. A solid 9/10!

"the_lead_general","2008-11-27T16:58:36.263Z","playibility","Knights catapult defence
 
Plus+
     Lots of characters, two skeletons and two knights. The catapult works well and one of the skeletons is an archer, they are very rare. The black skeleton is also cool. The knights are a swordsmen and a spearmen with shields. The barricade is useful and with some 4 by one by a third bricks you can join two together.

Minus-
      The catapult's top part falls apart easily. And it only comes with one rock.

Equals=
       A great set with lots of playability options which is well priced at $15.

             This set goes great with the kings castle siege and the skeleton tower. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>It was a quick and easy build, although the catapult doesn&#39;t look particularly accurate compared to those in later <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70403-1/Dragon-Mountain"">builds</a>. It is fun to play with, especially when the projectile knocks minifigures down, but it isn&#39;t particularly accurate, given that the catapult tends to move a fair bit when using the lever. &quot;Demolish the skeleton warriors&#39; barricade with the knights&#39; powerful firing catapult&quot;, probably requires a fair bit of luck...</p>
