"Ant","2007-05-14T10:49:23.413Z","1st Review","Found these sets (in South Africa) 10 May, at only 1 store, a full month before release.

I bought this set the minute I saw it, and liked it so much I went back 3 days later to buy 7093.

Great first set for the new Castle Theme
                Pros: 3x Skeletal Horses
                         3x New skeletons with new head decals and the new arm piece
                         Both new weapons (mace and scythe) and new shield
                Cons: Cant think of any yet

The carriage is modular with the prison cell being removable. The prisoner has a double sided head (scared on 1 side, smiley on the other)

This set is a must for 2007",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"benners30","2007-10-19T19:26:45.59Z","another 5","this is yet again another greatset. it has not 1 but 3 skellie horses, 1 reg horse, 2 knights, 3 skellies and well a prison carriage.

for weapons it has 3 scythe blades, 3 big spear things ( i forget what the name is), a whip, and a massive ax
the carriage is very nice and has a nice haunted look. it sports bones, a jail, and a guard tower on top. it also has a  guard tower on top.

great set",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

But well, I'd still like to stress that this set is awesome and it deserves a perfect 5/5. This is not a useful review, but 7092 is a wonderful set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lordofdragonss","2008-05-05T12:29:34.107Z","I'll help you my friend!","Skeletons' Prison Carriage IMO is one of the best designed castle set.

Pluses:
-Lot of minifigs
-Flip head
-4 Horses (3 bone, 1 live- with new red-brown nice color) 
-Big &quot;steel&quot; wheels
-nice weapons and armor
-tower can be detached
-realy cheap

Minuses:
Just one. I wish more shields",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greenfrog_7","2008-05-09T02:41:55.763Z","Skeletons' Prison Carriage... 3:10 to Skeleton-Yuma?","This is a great set, one that turned me on to LEGO after many years absence. It was a fun build, is great to play with, and includes a great number of figures for the size. This set sets the standards for a lot of the Castle products in my opinion, which is hopefully inspiring the design team to achieve some great things with the rebirth of LEGO Castle. All around this is a great set and everyone and anyone should pick it up. No excuses!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

They're gonna hang me in the mornin', never gonna see the sun.&quot;","Before I start this review, let me just say that the above is a qoute from the BEST western ever made: &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;. (Several other people have compared this set to that movie.) This set may not look like much, but it is! For a $20 set you usually get around two or three figs, with this set you get FIVE. There are also three skeleton horses and a regular one. This set also comes with plenty of weapons, armour, a couple of shields, plus one of the knights has a double-sided face.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-03-23T19:28:21.187Z","Gothic Doesn't Work on a Classic Theme","Lego Castle has been around for more than thirty years. Now, Lego tries to go gothic or emo on a classic theme which is just downright stupid. I don't like the horse skeletons and the fact that Lego didn't think twice beofre releasing this set. However, I like the black skeleton, but that's pretty much it. Overall, Lego tried putting a modern twist on an old theme, but fails.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"just2good","2008-12-18T16:24:24.34Z","SAVE THE PRISONER, THEN THE PRINCESS!","This set make a great addition to the skeleton tower. Like I like too cool this set &quot;Midevil Prisoner Transport&quot;!
Pros:
5 minifigs
Jail
A few horses
Wheels work!
Wepons
Jail is stackable to castle
Cool Faces
Cons:
$20 :(
Great addition two a Castle Collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keexko","2009-06-21T06:27:12.513Z","Very good but...","Like I stated in the title this is a very good set but...it lacks playability when it is ""alone"". Just my opinion, this set would jive in really great if you had other sets of the same theme, but it isn't all that fantastic when you only have the 3 skeletons and 2 knights to play with.

Nonetheless, it's a great army builder and it can really play a part in the Fantasy-Era Castle theme! :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CrzyLCF","2009-06-24T11:37:51.497Z","The most deadly prison carriage!","This set is absolutely splendid! I wasn't expecting this much from a $28 set. It just exceeds my expectations. It comes with an amazingly detailed prison carriage that is so evil with all the bones sticking out that it even scares me off sometimes, 5 minifigs! (a black skeleton, 2 white skeletons, a peasant knight and an advanced knight), 3 skeleton horses and 1 live horse with a blue cap! What more can you expect from a $28 set? <br><br>The prison itself is fantastic with the knight captured in it, you can take it out seperately from the carriage. But watch out for his friend on horseback trying to retrieve him back! The tower on top of the prison with the 2 skeletons is neat with the torches and all of the bones sticking out from it. <br><br>The carriage itself amuses me so much. The color scheme just makes it feel more right. The spikes in front of the carriage and the two halberds in front of the 3 skeleton horses is very clever which makes the knight more frightened on his mission to save his friend. <br><br>The only thing that makes me wonder is why does the knight's horse have a blue cap but no armor? It just makes the horse seem more naked, but that's not a big deal. Overall, this set is a total must have! It goes well with the Skeleton Tower and it just has everything you need for a deadly skeley prison carriage. I guarantee you won't be disappointed at all!<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"CharlieTheFunEngine","2010-09-20T20:00:58.2Z","TinyTurbosCityAndToyStory Reviews Episode 12: Skeletons' Prison Carriage","Ugh! Fantasy Era was three years where the Castle theme simply died, and this set is no exception. I loved Knights' Kingdom II and I'm accepting Kingdoms as average, but I have no words for my hatred of Fantasy Era.<br><br><h4>Building Experience:</h4>Actually pretty good! After you've replaced the minifigures the horses with those from other subthemes. What I'm saying is that the carriage is good, but not it's setting.<br><br><h4>Parts:</h4>Lots of new parts! Skeletons are great fun when they look like <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=gen001"">this</a>. However, when they're evil skeletons that can move of their own accord...I'm just saying that skeletons weren't exactly the best choice for an enemy army.<br><br><h4>Playability:</h4>Very nice without the skeletons. Use one of the nice, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">living</span> bad guys from subthemes past. Kidnap the knight, ride away and try to stop the other knight from rescuing his buddy. <br><br><h4>Value for Money:</h4>The set itself is satisfactory and worth around AUD$25 (I paid AUD$37). I would have preferred this set without any minifigures rather than the ones that were included.<br><br><h4>Overall:</h4>This set completely turned me off Castle until Kingdoms came along in 2010. I loved Knights' Kingdom II, but Fantasy Era is just a joke.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Update 14 JANUARY 2012</span><br>Please remember readers, that you are rating this review on whether it was helpful, not whether you agree that Fantasy Era was horrible.

The Prison carriage has that feel that makes it feel like it was MADE for skeletons. Works very well! Not too many functions here, which I don't like but I don't hate either. The parts aren't the rarest. This Prison carriage made me happy! I got this for only $20?! AWESOME! I love this set! I still haven't taken it (All of it :P) apart!
