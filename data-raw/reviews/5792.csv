"Ant","2007-05-14T10:53:51.603Z","1st Review","Found these sets (in South Africa) 10 May, a full month before release

I'd bought 7092 the day I found these sets, and liked it so much I went back 3 days later to buy this 1

The pieces come in numbered bags, each numbering for for a different section of the tower, even though the tower is not modular. Just like 7092, and Im sure the rest of the range, this is a great set and I cant really find any cons with it.

I havent yet decided whether I prefer the new dragon pieces, or the brick built dragons from the viking theme.

This set has all the new weapons, arm pieces (for the skeletons) and new lighting pieces (should go well with palpatine fig)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dWhisper","2007-06-09T16:25:00.56Z","Variety is the spice of life","The 2007 sets represent a hybrid between the Classic Castle and the Knights Kingdom line, introduce a new bad guy, and add some much needed variety and spice to the line. In a lot of ways, it improves on the criticisms of the KK/KK2 lines. The He-Man weapons are gone, but the armor and weapon varieties are still there. 

Of all of the sets in the line, the Skeleton's Tower has the most going for it. It has a wide variety of figures, including a new maiden figure (finally!), a necromancer, a barded warhorse, and a drake. Figures aside, the keep has the over-the-top look present in the Castle line for years. There's a wide variety of parts and bricks, and the set is very interesting, especially as far as bad guys go. After-all, it looks far more like a Skull than the old scorpion tower looked like a bug!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"RangerTam","2007-06-20T18:11:33.42Z","Skeleton Tower","Well, I have to say I like the dragon, it is the reverse colors of the castle that my fiancee bought and both will go well with the green dragon from the viking fortress.  I'm building a dragon army, mwahaha!  No seriously, I do think they are cool.  The wizard is pretty sweet but I wish there had been skeleton horses with this set and that the skeleton horses in general had movable heads like regular horses.  I like the lightning pieces and the mace and am always glad for another crystal ball.  The princess is good to have and the hair and duel face is nifty.  I like the opening jaw, but between these sets, vikings and aquaraiders, I am positively saturated in fangs.  I mainly wish there was a wizard's laboratory or store room or something with more minifig accessories.  Where's the books and potions and stuff?  Both this and the castle are a bit sparsely furnished in that aspect.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

for figs it has a wizard, a knight, the princess, and 2 skellies.

for accesories/ weapons it has a evil magic staff thing, a sword, a flail and that reaper thing

"Nased","2007-10-19T07:10:49.403Z","Eerie, Wonderful Skeleton Tower","It has been a long time since an evil base can strike fear in me or create a feeling of horror. I used to be fascinated with the bases of the pirates or Vladek's Dark Fortress 8877. I never thought LEGO could come out with something as spectacular. I was proven wrong.

This is one of the last few set(2007 sets) that I bought. I bought the others ahead of this. I got this for $80.00SGD. I was hoping for more figurines though. Anyway, I think the design of this set is great. It has two towers at the top. The jaws of the Skeleton is movable. There is a spider and a bat and makes this set very different from the others. 

The poor princess is kept in the hanging skeleton prison. The minions of the wizard are going to battle the knight. 1 of the white skeleton is holding a long scythe and a small round shield while the other is holding a flail. I think the knight can easily kill them.

This knight is special because it's the only knight that has a long silver sword. It's also the only knight that holds a small crown shield. The other 3 knights in the series are holding a large crown shield. The evil magician has a wicked looking magical staff. The red pet dragon is scary. Apparaently this red dragon is the largest creature in the entire series.

This is a must buy set. You get one more knight, 2 white skeletons, 1 big red dragon. The evil wizard and princess are only found in this set, so it's a must buy.
I hope LEGO will learn from their mistakes. The main reason why I love this new series is due to the fact that the heores, knights, bad guys are exclusive to certain sets only. I like the KK series too until I get too many Vladek or Jayko from different sets. It's very irritating. 7093 is a classic and it's nice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Skut","2007-09-27T06:31:21.95Z","Excellent value for money","This set is retailing for AUD60 and I think it represents excellent value for money for Australian Lego buyers.  

The Necromancer minifig would have to be the best Lego &quot;bad guy&quot; I have seen and provides a great rallying point for those otherwise disorganised skeletons.  In my opinion, the whole set is worthwhile just for him!  The other minifigs are no waste of money either, especially the damsel in distress, whose reversible facial expression (an idea imported from the Exo Force lineup) makes for extra fun and playability.  

I would like to see some plumes - in the new colour scheme - for the knights' helmets ( a criticism that applies to all the new Castle sets) but this is adequately fixed with white plumes from Bricklink or any AFOL castle collector's extra stores. 

The dragon is also a great addition - plenty of poseability and great colour scheme.  Plus Lego have kept the set cost down by not trying to include glowing eyes or any other rubbish.  

A great set!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-12-01T15:30:54.56Z","Lacking interior","These set really goes well with the rest of the castle theme and here are my thoughts on the set.

The minifigs you start out building the minifigs you get to skeletons one armed with a scythe and another with one of the new flails. The wizard has very detailed legs and torso and has a belt featuring a few small bags on it. The princess has a new hair piece and has a scared expression and a smile on her head. The Knight is also nice though his torso is plain black. He has a shield and a chromed sword. His horse's armor is also detailed.

The dragon is built like the Dino attack dinos. He has some new black Viking horns. When complete the dragon looks nice and is rather big, and possable. 

The tower itself looks very evil like it should. The &quot;jaw Bridge&quot; works well using elastic and a little gear that you crank to open it. The biggest problem with this set is that there is absolutely no interior. I use part of it however as an armory to keep skeleton weapons. On the top floor there is a crystal ball for the wizard to look into. The catapult also works well but the pot is loose. The cage is also strong.

Overall this set is very good and I would recommend it. It gets a four because of no interior and because of being overpriced.

"David1971","2007-12-29T11:15:46.373Z","Not as good as it could be...","I was looking forward to building this set. As it turns out, it's OK but not brilliant. For &#163;30 (UK) it would be quite good, but as a relatively expensive &#163;40 set I thought there could be more to it.

On the positive side, the princess and wizard minifigs are very nice, and the drawbridge works pretty well and is a nice feature. It's good to have the crystal ball and other pretty transparent pieces.

On the negative side, it's not really what I'd call a proper building - it's more like a film set (or the Lego City Airport!) - all front and nothing inside. The drawbridge doesn't lead to anything - not even a platform - just a hole, an absence. So baddies can climb *over* the castle but they can't really invade it since ... there's nothing in it. The two top towers look pretty good, but are just stuck onto each side using Technic connectors, which lacks integrity I think.

Overall it's not bad, but a bit expensive and slightly disappointing.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"greenfrog_7","2008-05-09T02:44:31.937Z","Skeleton Tower","A great sized set for the price, some great components on the tower, and the wizard is great - easily putting his counterpart to shame. The dragon was a lot of fun, and has unfortunately been succeeded by the new Green Dragon packaged with the Troll Warship as my favourite. The hanging prison, small catapult, and multiple moving parts on the jaw of the tower make this a great one to play with and it is still a great display set.

"Bricktoothyo","2008-06-17T01:34:11.717Z","He built a tower of stone...with our flesh and bone!","Wow,I am really quite impressed with this one!
The Evil Wizard/Necromancer is a great piece,and you get a staff and crystal ball for him!
The skellies are cool,and I love the scythe!
The building itself,while a touch one dimensional is very cool,the mouth drawbridge opens and closes!
The cage is a really nice touch,I dig it.
The Dragon is AWESOME! Its mean as,and different to the one in the Kings Castle set.
The Princess is a brilliant minifig,and pretty curvy for a LEGO lady(sniggering)
The Knight is a dude,and not too over the top.
You get a spider and web,and a bat!
Overall I really,really like this set because I can use so many of its parts for other themes-the Knights head now belongs on my Robin Hood forestman,the Princess' head is now part of my Horror theme and I swapped the scythe with the one from Arkham Asylum so Scarecrow has a better one.
Fantastic,really harks back to the good old days!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"PhantomBrickmaster","2009-06-21T15:29:07.95Z","Great set but...","I got this set for $13 dollars on clearance at Target.  This set is pretty good, but it  has some flaws. 

The build was fun, yet challenging because of the drawbridge mechanism. 

Pros:
Mini-figs
Weapons
Crystal ball
Drawbridge mechanism works well
Bone cage
Dragon
The look of the set is cool
Rare half translucent orange rock pieces

Cons:
The side platforms keep falling off.
Not enough room for mini-figs to stand up in the upper half.
Rooms are not furnished (I had to make my own accessories).

This set is well worth the price on clearance but not at retail.

"thejoker34","2010-02-14T17:28:19.25Z","The Skeletons only base","This is the only skeleton base. Very good and is only one of three that has a dragon in it.
Minifigures-Knight: 10/10-very good minifigure. Silver shinyness is also great. 
Princess: 10/10-has weird pants. Double sided head is great.
Skeleton 1: 10/10-good. Scythe is nice.
Skeleton 2: 10/10-flail is a cool weapon. Otherwise it's a regular skeleton.
Wizard: 10/10-amazing. Details on body are wonderful, head details are great along with more details on the hat. Staff is really cool and beard is pretty nice also. 

Dragon-10/10-Nice dragon. Flame in mouth stinks but it is able to come out. Details are nice with cool printing all over it. Plus bonus seeing as this is the cheapest set with a dragon.

Skeleton tower-10/10-terrific. There is storage space in back along with towers to place skeletons, cobwebs, and a catapult on one of the towers. The skull face is detailed and looks nice. The mouth is actually a drawbridge that comes up by turning a wheel on the side. The only con in this set is the side pieces with spikes constantly fall off. Otherwise it's perfect.

An evil wizard, animated skeleton and a huge fire breathing dragon all packed in an awesome design of a Tower set. The Tower front has a skull facade to it, the jaw being the drawbridge and the chains that pull it shut or open it coming from the eyes. Spider web and giant spider.

"Ernst","2016-03-31T22:13:34.62Z","Skeleton Tower ; a heroic Knight against all odds !!","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks :</strong> Another great set from the Fantasy Era subtheme, this being the &quot;home&quot; of the Evil Wizard and his Skeleton Army and also defended by the huge Dragon.&nbsp;A real scary tower in great colors&nbsp;with a drawbridge, small catapult and an outside prison. Naturally a must have for a Castle fan but also a very good playing set. A minor setback&nbsp;could be&nbsp;the interior (or better lack of interior) of the tower which is in fact none, this might have been better. On the other hand that would have increased the retail price considerably without improving the playing quality. So overall no reason to distract a brick or star for it. It is still affordable to buy it used so if you come across it don&#39;t hesitate to buy it, it will be worth your while.</p>

<p><strong>Building 4 bricks :</strong> A nice set to built and not too difficult. You start off course with the minifigures and mean looking fire-spitting dragon. After the drawbridge and the bottom floor with in the back a big spider in his web and left and right ornated by 2 big fiery rock parts and dragon teeth. The first floor is used for the drawbridge mechanism and doesn&#39;t leave much room for more interior. The second (and top) floor is the base for the tower and the prison attachment and is mostly formed by several turrets and a tower part. The prison is built of dragon teeth again. The result is a scary building, not very functional but it looks great also thanks to the best and most fun&nbsp;part to built namely the big skull which you mount at the front of the tower !! So not the most challenging built but fun to do.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks :</strong> A lot of great parts in this set : the Dragon of course, the <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?M=cas326"">Evil Wizard</a> and the <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?M=cas333#T=P"">Crown Princess</a>. The trans orange parts, especially <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=47847pb002U&amp;idColor=18"">the rock parts</a> and the Wizards <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=59233pb01&amp;idColor=15"">magic sparks</a> and a huge load of weapons and other accessories like the big and small teeth. And overall all great Castle parts for all your MOC&#39;s. One small point of criticism might be that there is only one Crown Knight to fight these four bad guys including a dragon.....</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks :</strong> Just a look a the set explains the 5 bricks although I must repeat that&nbsp;it takes a lot of fantasy to find a way for the good guy to release the fair maiden but it is the Fantasy Era of course so who knows ......</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks : </strong>The <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?S=7093-1#T=P"">used price on Bricklink</a>&nbsp;is at the moment about the same as the RRP as you see which is not a bad deal I think. The price will rise I think in the future like most Castle sets, I found it for &euro; 35,00 so a good deal.</p>
