"frogstudio","2008-03-05T21:19:43.687Z","Great Set","A really great set.  It's true that its is short, but the design is exelent.  I actually bought two of them and joined the, resulting in a four facade building with a 64 studs platform. Greta minifigs, great colur scheme, no faults to me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-05-11T09:39:36.187Z","Small but nice station.","This is a nice little station.  It looks good, has plenty of details such as a cafe, ticket machine, varied minifigs.  It must also be the only set I've seen with one of those push-along carts for checking cracks in the railway lines.  There's also one of those old-fashioned clocks, which I prefer to the digital clocks some of recent Lego stations have had.  My only real gripe is that interior detail could have been better.  The office upstairs is completely empty, for example.  But other than that this is a nice set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lotographia","2009-04-14T23:27:17.687Z","Functional but not outstanding.","Sometimes my minifigs aren't even waiting for the train. They just like to hang out at the train station, watching the people come and go, occasionally bumping into old acquaintances they haven't seen in years.

This set has a lot going for it. Five minifigs, extra rail, a box with a 'fragile' sticker on it, a push-cart rail thing, a small cafe, a place to sit on the roof, plenty of seating for people to wait.

On the other hand, nothing about the set really cries out 'classic'. I look at Grand Central Station and that set has the same colours but a more distinctive look about it. This set is sort of humdrum in comparison.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"brixton","2009-09-06T17:41:30.717Z","Choo Choo","The train station is much better than the actual train set (7897) but both work well together.  Lego probably made these two sets to complement each other.  The 7897 train doesn't work well on its own but is complete with the station.  The detail on this set is great.  I love the clock, the ticket vending machine, the barrier to enter the station, the system map, the clock, the seats, the cafe and the table and chairs upstairs.  

The upstairs office is empty but I think it is too small to actually fill it with furniture.  The train station is great and contains a lot of detail.  I do prefer some of the older stations especially the one with the bridge.  This station does contain 4 straight tracks so you can add it to the tracks that you have from the train to make the loop larger.  The train and train station are central components in my lego city.  5 minifigures seems to be the right amount for this set.  I would prefer something more like 8 though to give the station a more busy feeling with people in the cafe and on the platform plus a few more to stick in the train.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vlaky4","2010-06-05T18:13:09.03Z","Awesome set ","<p>I got this set for Christmas, and had lots of fun with it until it came apart. The little train that comes with it is a good addition to the set. Although the station is decently sized, it could have been longer for the train. Also, the conductor minifigure is good for anyone who has a passenger train to go along with this. Now for the Pros and Cons:</p>

<li>Extra Tracks</li>
<li>Two Floors</li>

"gigdoat2","2011-04-02T19:33:56.18Z","Looks very modern, in a good way","<p>This set looks alot like a real train station. It has just what you need from a train station, a passenger, a delivery man, a conducter, and a rail road worker. It's construction is pretty complex, so I recommend this for 10 and up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minifigs 
<li>Food 
<li>Hand Car 
<li>Turnstile 
<li>Destination Chart

<h4>Cons.</h4>

<p>If you have a train collection, get this set. 4/5</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,5
"Galaxy12_Import","2020-05-03T12:07:54.643Z","Functional Station, but Could Have Been More","<p>This building gets the job done if your city has limited trackside real estate and the majority of the population is using other transportation, because at the end of the day this train station is just....small.</p>

<p>There are good play features throughout the model, which includes a 2nd floor and some sections of track. Perhaps those bulky rails are driving up the price; I don&#39;t mind spending $45 for a train station but for that price point I think the model could have put 100 more bricks to good use and given the building more presence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a brighter note the yellow system parts are a welcome sight with ample amounts of arches and pillars. The station may be yellow only to follow in the footsteps of the superb&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4554-1/Metro-Station"">4554 Metro Station</a>&nbsp;(1991) and later&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4513-1/Grand-Central-Station"">4513</a>&nbsp;(2003). I also appreciate the step back towards the traditional style of 4554, suggesting an older rail hub in a city becoming more modern.</p>

<p>Throw in the handcar, minifigs, and 6x8 black slopes and the set is still worth picking up. In the very least it offers a starting point for modifications to make the station what it could have been off the shelf.</p>
