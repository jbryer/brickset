"legofanatic","2008-02-12T10:52:30.06Z","NO SANTA ?!","OK I do not understand this everything is perfect except no Santa ! Every LEGO city advent calendar has had a LEGO Santa Clause until now! You see one of the main reasons I bought this set was for Santa but you see if you don't have the 2005 or the 2006 one
then it's pointless. If you have it then I guess it's worth it.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2008-04-06T04:31:30.437Z","the thrill is missing","to be quite honest, i was pretty much bored with this calendar. although i'm a city guy, i found the ideas, little items and minifigs not very original, especially compared to the 2006 city calendar. some days i even forgot to ope the doors, which didn't happen the year before.
kids without a huge lego heap in their room will surely like this calendar, but to me there was just another fire fighter, another police man, another community worker - quite predictable and uninspiring. so this was perhaps my last city calendar, next year i will try the belville calendar, because last year it contained much more special parts and colours.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"HQuiff","2009-07-11T09:24:08.327Z","Let The Festive Spirits Come Alive","OK, well this I think would be my first LEGO City Calendar I got, and unfortunately, I'm sorry to say, my only one (For now). 


Price - 8/10. It was around â‚¬15 from my local ToyMaster, which IMO is fair, considering you do get feel of a nice Advent calendar from it, plus when you open the doors there's LEGO Pieces inside, not just Chocolate! XD
The only thing I do have a problem with, is that there isn't that many pieces altogether, which I think there could and should be.

Build - 9/10. Well, at the end of the day it is an advent calendar, which means it should be fun anyway! Plus there's some nice Minifigs, which is always nice.

Minifigs - 7/10. Nice, however also disappointing. Even though you do get some nice Minifigs here, there still City minifigs, and they all have professions, and uniforms! And on top of that, you don't get a Santa Minifig! :( That's why I'm looking forward to the Creator Christmas thingy this year!

Playability - ???/10. It's not really the type of thing you'd play with, it's more of thing where you'd add what you get in with your town. So it's a blank on that one.

Overall - ???/10. Yet to be decided. It's nice and original, however it can still be made better. Maybe this year it'll better.

Hope you guys found my review helpful! Oh, and thanks for reading!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
