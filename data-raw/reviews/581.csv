"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-11T22:02:02Z","Fantastic","Thi set is great. I loved playing with this set when I first got it. Sadly, the crane broke and I can't re-build this magnificant set (Or at least the crane). The snapping white shark is the best and so is the other sea creatures. Overall no cons or minuses, all pluses and pros. One of the best lego sets I have.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T15:07:53Z","Nice Topside Lab!!!! ","       Again, the next one of my diver reviews! Thsi set is very neat and the subs are cool! It even comes with a very small helichopper for scanning or something! The red divers carry the spearguns and a map and the discovery station holds a large crane which lowers and brings up a sub with 4 claws on it. Thsi set corresponds well with any other divers set and I would easily recommend it to anybody! The only problem is that the station is meant to be on water, but it isnt, so I would build it on a green baseplate or something of the type!

"jman","2007-02-16T17:20:13.623Z","Not So Impressed","I was really excited to get the only building type set for the diver series but was really disappointed. First off it has lots of big pieces and about 5 form 90% of the lab walls.

There is very little space for figures to do much on the lab floor besides use another X-ray machine and especially when the sub is parked on it. The helicopter pad could use a ladder to climb too or mini-figs can use the magical &quot;jump&quot;.

The crane is cool and so is the sub. The underwater scene and &quot;attack&quot; shark are awesome.

The helicopter in my opinion is the worst aspect of this set and is the worst Lego helicopter I have seen. The minfig barely fits in it, the hook does not have anything to hold or guide it, and the helicopter has so little detail and is small. I have helicopters from 1981 that were better then this one.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2011-07-27T17:05:56.203Z","Underwater excitement, a cool set !","<p>A great set I found in a deal of 12 sets. It is beautifull set you can place in between Town and Aquazone. The set is very well equiped and nice to built with a lovely result. The 5 bricks are well deserved again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building is fun to do, you built it piece by piece and it's all pleasant to do and not too difficult. You don't have to be a big building&nbsp;talent to complete this set, so nice for smaller kids too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great parts are used, the crane placed&nbsp;on the landing dock is very stable and works perfectly just like the&nbsp;reel in the helicopter. Two base plates, blue and beige, are a good invention. It has 3 great mini-figures, one with diving equipment, and a skeleton, a boat, a shark, a manta and a swordfish. An extra applause for the great sub.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the scenery and&nbsp;all the parts I mentioned and specially&nbsp;the below water scene playability is huge. The set guarantees hours of playing fun for kids no doubt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bricklink gives an average value&nbsp;just above&nbsp;€50,00 and I think it is worth it. Buying it combined with other sets I was lucky, my price was lower. If you like the set and can get it under €50,00 I would defenitly advise to buy it.</p>
