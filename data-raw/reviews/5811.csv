"pythonkid","2007-02-28T07:32:17.573Z","Great game, and an actual review with sales information","You can find this set in the US at toysrus.com. Just search for &quot;7714&quot;. 

Personally, i love this mech. its my favorite of 2007. I didn't like the torso much (bit unarmored and small) so i made it larger. The gold peices aren't that convincing to being gold, but the stickers are really shiny. The gun and sheild go great together. Most of the bulk is in the legs though. Also, this model is much better than the Sky Titan Combiner. 

Overall, i would say $25 is overpriced, but if you use google checkout, you can get it for 10 dollars off at toysrus.com anyways. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-07-31T21:31:10.99Z","AWESOME!","Okay, this is my first review! This set is one of my favorites! It's easy to build except for the legs! I had trouble on those. I LOVE the shield and that long gun! I like how your able to shoot the missle! One thing I don't like about it though is that the piece's arn't gold like on the box. There &quot;Dirty&quot; gold! It also comes with my favorite Charactor!
Pros:
Long gun,
Sheld,
Pieces,
Easybuild,
Favorite guy.
Cons:
Gold piece's arn't gold. There &quot;Dirty&quot; gold.
I would recamend this set to anyone!

"ponkusjr","2007-12-31T12:59:47.733Z","Nice set","I purchased this set today from my local Woolworths in the UK for a knock down sale price of &#163;9.99. This was the bargain of the week for me and i built it right away.
The set goes together very well and the legs are more stable than other exo walkers i have . When they say Limited Edition, How many where produced ?.
The minifig is great and the decals are cool in the metalic gold. It reminds me of Transformers in the way it stands. Many poses can be obtained from this Guardian and he sure looks the biz next to the gate.
It looks a little bigger than it really is, and was put in a big box. But hey, i am not complaining. I love Exo-force 
Great set and very stable. Nice selection of bricks",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-01-08T06:53:34.873Z","Amazing!","This set is no more than excellent. The shields were huge and cool, and it has a real missile launcher. It's only drawbacks is it has completely zero armor on back, and it's completely rubbish from the back. However, I hate the yellowish pieces, it will be more beautiful if it has real gold-coloured pieces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Alan93239","2008-01-26T06:28:05.123Z","Not Bad","First,this set got golden parts every where,such like legs,shield...(though it is not real gold).No offence,but I think the armour doesn't fit nicely,and Hayato can't really grab the control sticks.Last,the leg is cool,but it is very loose,but,it is still quite nice.

"Kruu","2008-03-24T17:03:17.92Z","Limited Golden Edition","I have most of the Exe-force 2006 and 2007 sets, this was first and the best, this set was the reason I started buying other Exo-force to my six years old son, atleast thats what I sad to my wife LOL, got it randomly (saw Limited edition label and had to have it) of the shelf at a local store for about 1/3 of a price more than regular Exo-force robots...

Anyways apsolutely the best Exo-force for now",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CyandraZ","2008-05-04T16:49:14.45Z","Big, bold, and beautiful.","2007’s Exo-force lineup was unfortunately mostly lackluster. Many of the kits that year showed extreme laziness in design – however, there were exceptions. One of them was the Golden Guardian, a ToysRUs exclusive that was most likely the finest kit that year.

Piloted by a Hayato figure with a shiny gold-armored suit, the Golden Guardian is still one of the largest two legged Exo-force mechs today, and the entire design is extremely impressive. Taking cues from Gundam and other anime shows, the Golden Guardian features a massive shield and a giant cannon arm with multiple weapons. The legs are huge, with armor coverings on the front and sides, and the shoulders have large armor plates on them as well. The designers of this kit obviously thought the design out, as it is nearly flawless, aside from the usual unarmored back common to exo-force mechs.

The Golden Guardian is also an awesome way to score a ton of useful pieces. The coolest ones are the golden details, including a giant pillar used as the main laser cannon, two technic armor pieces, and lots of small gold tiles. Even the stickers may be of use if they are not applied immediately, as they are extremely shiny and well printed. Other great pieces include tons of white smooth slopes, two large white fins, and a few dark red slopes and tiles.

Overall, Golden Guardian is an extremely impressive kit, and it contrasts the sloppy design prevalent throughout 2007. Whether you are an exo-force fan, a MOCer, or you just want to add another great kit to your collection, Golden Guardian will please you. 5/5.

"uberpuma1","2008-06-26T13:03:56.03Z","Best Mecha Design from Exo","I couldnt believe how flexible this set was. With the right pose, he really comes to life! I had just built the aero blaster, and was kindof disappointed with the mech.. but I am now thinking of combining the boosters from that with the golden guardian to make the ultimate flying-fighter!

Took about 20 minutes to build... it was really simple.. but very unique when put together.

The only real downsides I noticed were

A.. no hands...
B.. Gold isnt &quot;gold&quot; Couldnt they have sprung for an actual &quot;Gold&quot; metallic similar to some of the star wars collectors models? I mean, it was only three pieces. and STICKERS are horrible!
C.. My last grip which almost wasnt a gripe was the back side, they almost hid the lack of design back there with the shoulders. BUT.. a few slope pieces will fix that, or perhaps the booster pack from aerobooster

All in all, the Best Exo for play, the second best to look at (the first being the awesome bridge walker!)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"alva","2012-03-13T08:29:14.213Z","The Best Exo Force","<p>The ExoForce theme has been gone just before I came back from my Dark Age, so I never saw them on stores shelves and never realized that they have some sets that really cool. Just saw this set a couple days ago when a friend offering his set for sale. This Golden Guardian is, for me personally, is the best set from the line of Exoforce. A bit look like Gundam or Patlabor, and it able to pose to create some stunning pose.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cool name, cool idea to use gold, although the gold is not metallic but pearl gold, making it only achieve rating of four bricks instead of five bricks.</li><li>Ability to pose in a lot of different pose without trouble to balance it.</li><li>Cool printing for stickers.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Still using stickers.</li><li>I think the worst thing from Exoforce theme is because the robot doesn't have any head, making them really look like tools, not some cool mechas come out from a Gundam series. Put some head on the mechas, and i think it will really bust the sales of this line.I think by putting heads for the mechas, it will create a personality difference for each mechas, and they can stand alone without their drivers.</li><li>Unbalance shield. How come the shield is so thin and so long? What can it cover? It even can not cover the body of the robot.<br></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Again, with all the minus of this set, I still believe that this set is the best of the Exoforce line. And I will be happy if Lego decide to launch something similar in the future, but as my comment, please add some heads to the mechas, so they are real robot with their own personality, not some tool that human use. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Alemas","2010-03-05T13:31:38.047Z","Absolutely stunning","<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This set was launched in 2007, the year in which a new chapter in the Exo-Force storyline unfolded. In the story, the battle machine was one of the strongest of them all. In set form, it reflects that.</p>
<h4>Building Experience</h4>
<p>Very good. It's a pretty lengthy build, about 20 minutes. Not boring at all. 5/5</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Very good. It's gold heaven! You get a golden column, golden shield pieces, a cannon, some &quot;wings&quot;, and a Ha-Ya-To minifigure with gold torso! 5/5</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>Oh so good. The cannon works well(even if you can accidentally set it off), the set doesn't fall over, and it's very poseable! Only one problem: The pieces connecting the arms to the body can come off, but I don't mind. 5/5</p>
<h4>Value for Money</h4>
<p>&pound;19.99 for this? Stunning! 5/5</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>As the title says, absolutely stunning. It's in 4th place in my favourite sets list, and you'll not be disappointed! Highly recommended!<br />

<ul><li>-A gun and a shield- excellent.<br></li><li>-This is a giant mech, and it looks very heavy-duty. Awesome!<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons<br></h4>
<ul><li>-Gold should have been better represented here.</li><li>-The stickers have come for revenge.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>This is a truly magnificent set, and one that I must always keep. I recommend that you get this now from some fool who doesn't like it at all.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
