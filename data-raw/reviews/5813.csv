STORY
The storyline of the game is that the Toa Inika, while battling the Piraka, lost and were captured.  A black-and-white movie style version of Matoran Jaller takes it upon himself to become a Toa through energized Protodermis and rescue the Inika.  This is depicted through a series of pictures, a style that reminds me of the GBA version of LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game.

GAMEPLAY
The gameplay is very hard.  In what I know of the console versions, you move around, the Inika you play as automatically aims at an enemy; all you have to do is shoot.  Here, you have to move around, aim your weapons, and shoot at tons of enemies appearing in front, to the sides, and behind you.  Most irksome are the Nui-Rama (yay for 2001 Rahi!), who you have to aim at the sky to hit.

You go about in the levels, destroying containers, Bohrok, Visorak, Rahi, Rahkshi, and Vahki alike to collect studs.  Occasionally you'll have to build something, and the Unnamed Toa that the Matoran becomes (the default Toa) is the only one who can make Constractions.  There are five levels for every element, plus seven levels for a Makuta's Domain area.  With the exception of Makuta's Domain, in three of the levels, you're trying to collect the mask of a Toa Mata, Toa Metru, or Toa Inika.  In every level except for the Boss levels, you're trying to reach a gate or something to advance to the next level.

Hero Mode is different: you can activate it whenever you want (as long as you have enough pieces to activate it) but it cannot allow you to make Constractions as any character, does not make you completely invincible (your enemies can still kill you; that happened to me on a Water level), and, most importantly, it is NOT REQUIRED TO BEAT THE LEVEL.  There you go, another thing that people complain about the console versions - always needing to activate Hero Mode some time or another.

MUSIC
The music is something I must complain about.  I'm sure at one point or another everyone has heard the awesome music in the 1st Bionicle Heroes trailer or the score played on Bionicle Heroes's website, the former a &quot;combination of classical and rock,&quot; as some put it, the latter a very Bionicle-ish song.  The music in this version of the game, unfortunately, is rather techno-style and sounds like it could belong in the LEGO.com game Junkbot (anyone remember that game?).  While not entirely bad, I wish it could've had the music that the other versions have.

HUMOR
The humor level is another thing I must complain about.  LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game, LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy, and Bionicle Heroes (on other versions) all have a high amount of humor in them.  You cannot play one level of them without cracking up, rolling on the floor laughing, or just chuckling.  However, this version of Bionicle Heroes seems to lack humor.  All you do is going around shooting.  You don't see anything funny happening, and there aren't any real cutscenes.  Piraka Beach has also disappeared, so nothing funny is there.  Then again, this is what you have to expect from a 'T' rated game.  This is at first glance, however.  When you are looking back and playing the game for a second time, you will notice some humor in it after all.  The Big Heads cheat makes the Bohrok look absolutely ridiculous; sometimes, Vahki will jump up and spin around a few times before they are defeated; occasionally, when a Bohrok is hit, its head will start spinning around until it grabs and straightens out its head (Beetlejuice, anyone?); and if you hit Vezok with Jaller's weapon, he may start hopping around on one foot.

GRAPHICS
The graphics are... well, what you expect from a Nintendo DS game.  Surprisingly good, surprisingly bad at the same time, if that makes any sense...

MASKS
To rescue an Inika, you must collect their masks.  In each area (area, not level), there are 3 Masks - one belonging to the Toa Mata, one belonging to the Toa Metru, and one belonging to the Toa Inika, in that order.  To rescue the Inika, you collect the Toa Mata mask.  To upgrade the Inika, you collect the Toa Metru and Toa Inika masks.  In order to have a Toa perform his/her special abilities, like walking on water, you must collect all three masks.

RUNES
You also collect Runes in the game.  Runes are sorta like the Minikits in the LEGO Star Wars games, but they serve a different purpose.  Runes are Matoran Letters hidden throughout the different levels.  When you collect one, you get to keep it.  Later, you can use these Runes to unlock Extras, but you still will need to purchase the Extra with the Technic pieces you collect.  You unlock the extras by using your Runes to “translate” a Bionicle character’s name that accompanies the Extra.  For example, to unlock the Invincibility Extra, you must have 1 “H” Rune, 2 “A” Runes, 1 “K” Rune, and 2 “N” Runes, which would spell out Hakann’s name.  Then you must purchase the Extra for 200,000 Technic pieces.
Armor Runes are also found in the game.  They are meant to increase your health meter, and there's a total of 6 of them in the game, one for each element.

CHARACTER BIOS
These are BIOS on the different characters in the game.

TOA
Silver Toa – A brave, unnamed Toa takes it upon himself to save the Inika.  His weapon is a Zamor Launcher, and it has unlimited ammo, but unfortunately not very strong.  He is the only Toa that can build Constractions.
Kongu – The Toa of Air is here to save the day!  His weapon is an Electricity Shooter, a rather strong weapon, plus if launched correctly can attack multiple foes.  After collecting Kongu’s third mask, he has the ability to hover in the air for four seconds.
Nuparu – The former inventor is now a great Toa!  His weapon is a claw - a strong weapon, and if shot correctly can hurt multiple foes.  However, his strength doesn't really come out until after you have unlocked the Invincibilty cheat.  After collecting his third mask, Nuparu has the ability to destroy certain walls, and can destroy Nektann.
Jaller – The bold leader of the Toa would be Jaller!  His weapons is a Fire Sword, that is not very strong, but can rapid-fire.  After collecting Jaller’s third mask, he can also shoot a more stronger attack from his sword that is unfortunately not rapid-fire.  He can also walk on or in lava after collecting the third mask.
Matoro – This Toa is as cool as, well, ice!  His weapon is an Ice Sword, a weapon I appreciate for its long-range and ability to kill some fire-elemental enemies with one shot.  After collecting his third mask, Matoro can act as a sniper, making his range even farther!  Also, his weapon has a “freeze” effect, which means that sometimes, enemies can get frozen and either move slowly or don’t move at all, depending on how many of his masks are collected.
Hewkii – Hewkii rocks… literally!  His weapon is the Po-Koro, which throws bombs at the enemies, but is the farthest thing from rapid-fire.  The amount of launched bombs depends on how many masks of his you have collected.  After collecting his third mask, Hewkii can clear away piles of bricks.
Hahli – Just because water is soothing doesn’t mean that Toa of Water are!  Hahli’s weapon is a Propeller that shoots a stream of water at the enemies.  The downside is that it isn’t very strong.  Hahli, after collecting her third mask, can walk underwater without getting hurt and can use a radar to detect hidden secrets in the levels!
All weapons except the Zamor Launcher have unofficial names and have limited ammo.

REGULAR ENEMIES
Bohrok - These guys usually roll into the scene.  Not altogether very strong, but they tend to appear in groups and surround you.  Very annoying when they do that.  However, they are the weakest enemies.  Types: Kohrok, Gahlok, Tahnok
Nui-Rama - Flying from the skies come the Nui-Rama.  It's hard to hit these guys because they're in the air and are bobbing up-and-down constantly.  Not as common as Bohrok, Visorak or Rahkshi, but much more common than Vahki.  Types: Green Nui-Rama, Orange Nui-Rama
Visorak - Usually rising from the ground or dropping from the sky, a Visorak enters the chamber.  One of the more common enemies, like the Bohrok, they have a tendency to come when you least want them.  Types: Keelerak, Roporak, Oohnorak
Rahkshi - A pillar of light appears, then disappears, and in its place is a Rahkshi.  Unlike the other versions of the game, these are not Bosses - just regular enemies.  Nonetheless, they are still a challenge to beat.  Types: Turahk, Guurahk, Lerahk
Vahki - When you think you had enough of enemies, a Vahki appears.  Extremely powerful enemies, they require many shots to kill.  Luckily, they're not all that common in early levels of each area.  Unfortunately, once you encounter your first Nuurahk, then their numbers increase greatly!  Types: Keerahk, Nuurahk, Rorzakh
Nui-Jaga - These scorpions mean trouble!  Stronger than any other common enemy, they will attack without warning and bring certain disaster!  Although their attacks are slow, they're enough to put you in danger should you get hit by one!  Should you get hit by two... Types: Blue Nui-Jaga, Purple Nui-Jaga
Muaka - For sheer strength, the Muaka is found as a guard at Makuta's Domain!  Unlike all other enemies, the Muaka doesn't attack using blasts.  Instead, the Muaka charges at you, and when he hits... serious damage is done!
Giant Tahnok - Yes, folks, when it seems that this is a serious game, a Giant Tahnok walks in, and it brings certain cases of rolling on the floor laughing from the sheer randomness of one existing!  Interestingly, it behaves like a normal Bohrok, and its attacks aren't all that strong.
Frost Beetle (name unconfirmed) - Another guard of Makuta's Domain, the Frost Beetle is a giant menace not to be reckoned with!  Be careful, for it fires super-strong blasts similar to that of Level 3 Hewkii!

BOSSES
Zaktan - Is it a swarm of protodites?  No, it's Zaktan!  A toughie to beat, but with a little strategy of mine, he is very easy to beat.  His attacks are lightning-based, like Kongu's.  But be careful - when he turns into a swarm of protodies, he's invincible... and you're not!
Reidak - The Piraka of Earth strikes!  The good news is that most of his attacks, like Nuparu's, are relatively short-ranged, so stay far away and shoot over long distances to defeat him!
Hakann - With the help of Rahkshi, Visorak, and Vahki, Hakann seems unbeatable!  His shots are rapid-fire, just like Jaller's, so watch out!  Not even Matoro's freeze effect can slow down this series of shots!  On top of that, the lava in the furnace is rapidly rising...
Thok - Sometimes your advantages are your disadvantages, and Thok is proof of that!  Standing on faraway pillars, his uses his long-ranged shots, like Matoro's, to attack!  And plus, he's got a really creepy laugh... The best recommended Toa would be Jaller, for obvious reasons.
Avak - Sitting on the throne is the Piraka of Stone!  At first he's only sitting down, but when you attack him, the battle begins!  With the help of numerous Keerahk and his bombs, just like Hewkii, Avak plans to stomp all over you!
Vezok - Perhaps the hardest of the Piraka to beat.  Shooting at you with his beam of water, similar to Hahli's, Vezok is aided by Visorak, Rahkshi, Nui-Jaga, and more!  It takes courage to beat him!

EXTRAS
Here is a list of the extras, with the required unlocking Rune combination in parenthases.

Unlimited Ammo (Avak) - Your Toa Weapons don't need recharging
Invincibility (Hakann) - Self explanitory
One Hit Defeat (Reidak) - Defeat any enemy except for the Piraka with only one shot
Disco Craze (Thok) - Background and enemies flash disco colors
Crazy Colors (Vezok) - Enemies are weird colors
Sihouettes (Zaktan) - Each area is colored by its elemental color
Makuta Mode (Voya Nui) - Enemies are colored black and a lot stronger
Human Voice (Makuta) - Sound effects of your weapons are that of a young kid making weird noises
Animal Farm (Piraka) - Zamor launcher fires random farm animals
Piraka Party (Inika) - Upon the defeat of an enemy, a balloon begins to rise, and confetti falls
Big Head (Irnakk) - Nui Jaga and Bohrok have abnormally large heads
Tiny Enemies (Mata Nui) - Enemies are shorter

OVERALL
If you grow bored of your other BIONICLE Heroes versions and want to give this a try, go ahead!  But if you like lots of humor, get the other versions instead.
