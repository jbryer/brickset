They have reason to dislike some of them, but I must say that this one deserves a good rating. Bionicle Heroes was a terrific console game, and the GBA version, although different, is just as good. (As GBA games go.)<br><br><br>The game's style is a standard overhead shooter, and involves a more or less constant shooting pattern. Although somewhat shallow, this makes for a very entertaining game cycle. It is not impossible to practice complex firing maneuvers, namely strafing and sniping. Although&nbsp; the standard attack of each of the six Toa is the same, their secondary attack (which has a charge bar and runs out quickly, although it recharges) are very different, so players with varied preferences will have no trouble picking a favorite Toa to use.<br><br><br>The Piraka bosses are not very hard to defeat, in fact you can easily beat them in one sitting. Nonetheless, they have creative special abilities. (And I must say, Vezok is really tough).<br><br><br>About the game's longevity, or life span: Some people have beat this game in a week. It all depends on how much time you have on your hands. But even if you have beat the game, there are reward mini-games that you get for your final score. And you will keep trying to get them all. The fun Extras (unlockable perks gained from finding runes) will also keep you at it for a long time. So overall, the game has a pretty good life, especially if you leave it on a shelf and come back to it two months later.<br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Now I will cover the secondary attacks of every Toa in the GBA game. (The primary attacks are all the same.) Partially for fun, partially to inform the community. In any case, I like writing reviews. :)<br><br>Firstly, the Elemental Fire secondary. This is a spread attack, it shoots three bolts of fire that spread out as they travel farther. They don't spread too much though, and stop spreading after a short distance. This a good weapon to use in many circumstances, it can be used about 3 times before running out of charge, I believe. If all three bolts hit the target it causes a great deal of damage. Keep in mind that it only goes in one direction. As you progress (first the Toa Mata, then the Toa Nuva, then the Toa Inika) the bolts get bigger and take less up less charge.<br><br>Secondly, the Elemental Water secondary. It is a straight beam of water that goes in one direction. It passes through all enemies in its path, so is good if you have them all lined up. It does a good deal of damage too. It also takes about two uses before running out of charge. This is, frankly, my least favorite of the secondaries, but this is a matter of opinion. It does have its advantages. As you progress, the beam gets thicker and more damaging.<br><br>Thirdly, the Elemental Air secondary. In my opinion, this is the coolest secondary. Form your own views, but this is one powerful weapon. It fires a beam of lightning. This beam can hit as many targets as are in its path, can go through barriers, and homes on the nearest enemy (usually, sometimes it behaves oddly). As for disadvantages, every shot does use the full charge bar. It will be quite slow firing. Other than that, it is almost perfect. It can cover your back, wreck the opposition in front, and shoot from behind things. As you progress, the lightning beam gets thicker and much more damaging. At full level at kills almost anything in one hit.<br><br>Fourthly, the Elemental Stone secondary. It fires rocks (:P) in a sheer diagonal pattern forward. they pass through multiple targets and do decent damage. Where it gets really interesting is that if it hits a wall, it will bounce off, up to three (four?) times before dissipating. as you can fire it twice before running out of charge, you can quickly fill a tight area with bouncing, deadly rocks (:P). As you progress, the rocks get more damaging, and at full level (Inika) you fire four rocks instead of just two, which can be <span style=""font-style: italic;"">devastating.</span> Somewhat of an odd weapon, pretty specialist. Not bad though.<br><br>Fifthly, the Elemental Earth secondary. This is a large, black and yellow ball (much like the console version) that explodes nicely, like a grenade. Treat it like a scatter grenade, though it can be good against individuals. As you progress, the ball gets larger and more powerful. At the full level, the balls get huge and home in on the nearest target. At this point, Nuparu (the Toa Inika of Earth) is possibly the best Toa when he has a distance to fire from. At short range, the balls don't have time to turn in their flight and often miss entirely. Also, you can fire three times before running out of charge.<br><br>Sixthly (and lastly) the Elemental Ice secondary. This is a bolt of ice. It travels slowly, so it may miss. You can fire about three times before running out of charge. It might (?) do a little bit of damage, but its main benefit is that is freezes the target. It doesn't freeze it for long, but it could be vital, especially against a more powerful enemy, like a boss. It is weak at first, (with the Toa Mata and Nuva levels) but when you upgrade to Matoro, it gets powerful and large enough to be very useful.<br><br>&nbsp;A word about ""charge"": The secondary attacks rely on an energy bar, displayed on the side of the screen. Every time you fire the secondary, it drains a piece out of the energy bar. This will immediately begin recharging, unless you use the full bar. Then it take a second or two for it to begin recharging again. How much energy each attack uses was noted above.<br><br>Finally, a word about something that few people have addressed: The 
music. The soundtrack for the GBA version is terrific. Although it is 
clearly typical of GBA chip music, it is nonetheless quite well composed
 and some pieces are exciting, mellowing, or just ominous. All in all, 
the music fits the game well and I enjoy turning the game on just to 
listen to the music.<br><br>Overall, this is an excellent, very fun game for Gameboy Advance. If you
 can get it at under 20 dollars I would highly recommend doing so. It 
has been my favorite Gameboy Advance game for years. Cheers!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
