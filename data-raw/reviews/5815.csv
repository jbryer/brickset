The graphics are great, and it bring back old favorites like Visorak, Bohrok, and Vahki.  From a playing perspective it's a good game, with six available characters to play with in every level (the Toa Inika), and if you complete that 'world' you unlock the Piraka for that region after fighting him.  When you complete all six regions, you fight Vezon and Fenrakk, and unlock Vezon (but not Fenrakk unfortunately) to play as in every level.  Also, when you get enough LEGO Pieces, you can buy goodies from Balta in the Matoran Enclave.

Pros:

-Good Graphics

-Great gaming quality

-Brings back old favorite characters

-Just a great game

Cons:

-You can't jump

Overall great game.  Go get it if you have a GameCube.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
