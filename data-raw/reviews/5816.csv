The graphics are great, and it bring back old favorites like Visorak, Bohrok, and Vahki.  From a playing perspective it's a good game, with six available characters to play with in every level (the Toa Inika), and if you complete that 'world' you unlock the Piraka for that region after fighting him.  When you complete all six regions, you fight Vezon and Fenrakk, and unlock Vezon (but not Fenrakk unfortunately) to play as in every level.  Also, when you get enough LEGO Pieces, you can buy goodies from Balta in the Matoran Enclave.

Pros:

-Good Graphics

-Great gaming quality

-Brings back old favorite characters

-Just a great game

Cons:

-You can't jump

Overall great game.  Go get it if you have a GameCube.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

They seem a bit shoddy sometimes. But at other times you can really spot they're shine. Lava effects are beautiful and jungles look lush. And the characters are detailed.<br><br>GAMEPLAY: Really good! The game is played in sort of a over the shoulder view. which makes it much different from the other Lego games like Star wars and Indiana Jones. You start out the game in the matoran enclave, where the soul survivor, Balta can give you upgrades and goodies if you have enough credits. Once you are in the enclave, you walk down a little tunnel which leads to a room with six doors. Each door leads to different sections of Voya Nui.<br>Each section is under the control of&nbsp; a Piraka. Each door has 4 levels. So all in all, there are 24 levels. In each level you solve some Technic puzzles, fight hordes of Visorak, Bohrok, and Vahki. You encounter 6 masks in the levels, each grants you the power of Toa. Example: White mask for Matoro, Red for Jaller. Each Toa has a special ability. For example, Jaller can walk through lava and Hewkii can build things. Most levels end with a boss fight. Ranging from&nbsp; Rahkshi, to Brutaka, to Krekka. <br><br>ENVIRONMENTS: Absolutely astonishing! The jungle levels are lush and filled with rivers. The volcano levels are...Incredible. Vast canyons filled with boiling, steaming lava. And in the mountain levels there are caves made of solid ice! <br><br>SOUNDTRACK: Its actually very very good. Ranging from exotic island music, to jazz, lol.<br><br>THE BAD: Some fans might not like the way Lego made the piraka. They were stupid. And always get outsmarted by puny Krataa. However, I thought they were funny. Also, Kongu is the only one who can jump. And only at specific locations.<br><br>FINAL OPINION: This game is very good. Its much more action filled that other Lego games. Its funny and nice to look at. You probably should only get the PC version if its the only way you can get the game. Like me.<br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
