"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-15T17:12:21Z","Decide for yourself...","I had this set. I have always liked the way these 2 robots looked, and I appreciate the thought that went into their design. The set is a good source for moving parts and claws, but other than that its mostly standard briks that you can find anywhere. One problem I had was that the blue one doesn't move around to well and is prone to breaking. The red one on the other hand is sleek, bendable, and goes great with any spyrius set. Both however, are fun to build though it might get a little complicated for a small kid. I give this a 6 because overall it's only slightly above average than what I expect from Lego.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It's like the Value Meal of lego sets when it would be far more enjoyable to just pay up for the Big Mac.&nbsp; Well, you know how the saying goes, you sometimes get what you pay for.&nbsp; I would peg this set into that category.&nbsp; It is cheap in price, but also cheap in its value as well.&nbsp; This set does not belong to any theme, so its very bland and anonymous.&nbsp; I recall it coming in a strangely shaped box, almost unrecognizable as lego.&nbsp; The colors scheme seemed very muted.&nbsp; The pieces are random, I mean honestly, the blue robot's mouth is made out of telephone keypads.&nbsp; Are these crater critters or more like garbage critters?&nbsp; The finished models are fragile and offer virtually no playability.&nbsp; Pretty much the only saving grace here was that it's still technically Lego (sadly), and you can dump the pieces into the rest of your collection of building inventory, which is what I did.<br>",TRUE,2,2,3,2,2
"zipper","2012-02-25T00:43:01.76Z","An odd set by Lego","<p>This set was strange. I remember getting it for Christmas and I was super excited to put it together, only to see that there were some major flaws with it. I'm not exactly sure why Lego produced and released this set for a number of reasons but I think this set is best explained with pros and cons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Some cool pieces</p>
<p>Low price</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>No minifigs</p>
<p>Random pieces (felt like a set where Lego just needed to get rid of some pieces)</p>
<p>Poor playability (the blue one was very stiff)</p>
<p>Strange box</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set really is only good for getting some spare pieces.</p>",TRUE,2,3,3,1,3
