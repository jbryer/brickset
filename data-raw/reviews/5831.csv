This is definitely a great combination of renowned characters, and is a great way to access the figs without forking out money to buy the sets in which they appear (especially since both Robin and Joker appear in very costly sets). It is a pity that they don't come equipped with any weapons or accessories - it would have been great to see a Joker bomb, or a whip. One star off for that, but besides that, this is an excellent addition to any Batman Lego collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
