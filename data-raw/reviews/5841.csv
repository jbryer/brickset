"jinxjinx550","2010-02-13T14:16:46.873Z","Great source for rare parts","<p>Boys don't tend to like Belville sets, but they're a fantastic source of parts you can hardly find anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; A great source for pirate hoards, space villain&nbsp; bases, and all kinds of castle interiors.</p>
<p>In this Belville advent calendar, I netted a total of fourteen jewels, seven animals, five food items,&nbsp; seven eating utensils (including the very rare teapot), eleven plant items including the rare snow-topped tree and the rarer white vine piece, plus a whole lot of transparent &amp; transparent glitter pieces.</p>
<p>Nearly any one of these would be among the most desirable pieces in a small or medium set, but when you look at the total collection of great pieces, the value of this set is obvious.&nbsp; Plus, it makes a great gift for anyone who's not allergic to pink, and -- like all the Advent calendars -- a good introduction to Lego for a child who's never experienced Lego before.</p>
<p>And if you don't succeed at hooking the child on Lego, chances are the child's mom or dad might pass the great collection of rare pieces back to you!</p>
