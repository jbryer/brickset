"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-07-27T06:19:24.567Z","One small step into the Expanded Universe","This is Lego's first set outside of the Star Wars films. Why they decided to make a TIE Crawler, of all the other craft in the Expanded Universe, is beyond me. It is also quite odd that Lego has persisted with the blue colour scheme used on most of its other TIE craft as well. All this aside, though, the TIe Crawler looks very faithful to its original design, and the threads look way awesome as well. Adding to that, the minifigures included are the all-new and quite nicely designed Black hole stormtroopers, both armed with the new blasters. One small step into the EU, hopefully paving the way for more sets to come.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Will make nice custom fodder parts. One thing I need to mention. This is NOT legos first step into the EU. If you remember the Tie Fighter set. It has a fighter in there that was never before seen in movies.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Pegasi","2007-10-14T13:15:31.23Z","Well, what else can I say? Some darn good minifigs, and not much else...","Lego hasn't been making that many EU sets, and so when I saw that this was coming up, I was rather pleased to see that they might be verging into it. This could mean a lot of very interesting sets, as well as less re-releases.

   I think that Lego did do a good job with this. I mean, it looks fairly good, as well as the fact that I love the new shadow troopers. I also enjoyed building it, as there were few repetitions, and it was fairly simple to make. But I found that there were a few parts of it that continued to bug me. The first of these, and the most annoying by far is that the side of the crawler on the outer edge kept on falling off. Now I'm not sure if this was just because of the way I was constructing it, but I have been finding that having to tighten the edge every five minutes or so started to get slightly aggrevating.
   Another of the bad parts of this was that, it really is fairly hard to find anything to do with it. It generally takes up a fair bit of room on a mock battlefeild, and also it's fairly hard to actually get it to make much of a difference. It doesn't really run over anything very well, and the guns aren't exactly that usefull for aiming well.

All in all, I think that It was decent, although lego could have done a better job. If you need new treads, want something to destroy in a battle, or feel like spending $50 for some new minifigs that will likely come out in a cheaper set soon enough, than I suppose you may as well get it. If you're not that interested, you might as well save your self $50.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Legonater","2007-09-19T21:13:49.39Z","awesome set","First, I would like to say that this is the second EU related set, the TIE/D fighter in the Tie Fighter Collection set is EU. This set looks aweesome. I can't tell the difference from the black hole troops and the Tie pilots. I like the missiles and treads, but why do thesae vehicles have that thing sticking out the back? Balance? Either way, v ery EU accurate (Can't be movie accurate) and very cool-looking. Can't wait till it come out.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mikelen","2007-10-09T18:19:01.873Z","It's an OK set","I'm not really into the EU of SW, but a SW Lego *is* a SW Lego and I will do my best to own it.

This was the only one I needed to complete my 2007's, so I E-Bay'd it - it cost a bit more, but (like i said) I needed it.

I guess in the EU, if it works there, it's OK - as a model - I dunno.

Those treads are an annoying bit (81 x 2). And I guess the sides rotate up for a reason...

But, overall, it's an OK set - if you're only into the movies, don't get it.

If you collect them all (like idiot me), then of course, but it!!   :)

"Redbullgivesuwind","2007-11-06T07:37:59.187Z","A not bad attempt","Yeah i agree this set is very very over priced but hey what set ain't nowadays.
I like the Shadow troopers and its faithful to the original design and the colour scheme is right. Its sturdy the number of times iv dropped this and its been fine is a good testiment to it.

"Manxboi24","2008-02-14T19:44:50.81Z","Actually quite good","OK, I got this set recently on clearance at Target for $35.  I don't think that it was ever worth $50 - 164 of the pieces are treads!  But, this set is fun to play with and has some cool features.  Now, on with the review:

Minifigs:

This set comes with 2, new Shadow Stormtrooper minifigures.  There are really accurate to all of the pictures I've seen of them and are very aesthetic to look at.  They come with the new style blasters which is a big plus as well.

Parts:

This set comes with a great selection of treads - 164 of them.  There are some nice black and blue pieces as well, however, especially those that make up the treads.  

The Build:

The build is divided into 3 stages:  The cockpit, the right tread and the left tread.  The cockpit uses some new techniques, some of which are different to the usual TIE style.  The tread use quite a few technic pieces such as rollers for the tracks to glide on, instead of gears which can get snagged.  The 2 treads did get pretty boring to build but at least they separated the 2 sets of tracks into 2 bags so that you don't have to count them out. Just subtract 1 from each bag since they are spares and you'll be fine.

Overall:

This is a really cool set.  Even though I'm not a huge EU fan, I find this set fun to play with.  There are plenty of playability options such as the hidden blasters and the treads can flip around.  If you see this on clearance at Target, I'd recommend you get it.  

My rating: 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Da_LegoBuilder","2007-11-05T10:30:40.81Z","Don't Get It!","Here's a lot of reasons why to not get the Tie Crawler!

-I was so excited of opening it, and when I did, some pieces spilled out, not packaged. (I'll sue!) &gt;_&lt;
-There was no extra pieces, so if you are a person who loses parts while building sets, then this set is not for you.
-looks so much better on the box.
-2 Shadowtroopers?! Give more than that. This is a limited Edition!
-The missle on the bottom, it doesn't go very far...
-The missile always sliding out when you move the tie Crawler!
-Are you used to grabbing the lego in the middle to transport it? Well, if you grab the cockpit, then the wheels rotate down, and then you need to fix it. Now you need to grab the lego with both hands instead of one.
-Needs more guns, how did the imperials approve this blueprint of the tie cralwer? They were known for their tremendous firepower!
-wheels aren't sturdy, especially when you are joining the two plates together, it breaks.
-Limited Edition?! It's horrible.
I think that's enough reasons for you...so DON'T GET IT!

"Leggodt94","2007-12-01T14:19:32.59Z","Not too good","I mean sure its big and sure its got guns and sure its got treads, but the thing that bothered me is that it was just like building any other boring tie fighter. I mean, ther're all the same. What's the interst? What's the mystery to the components of this set? Bottom line, if you've built one tie you've built them all. And the shadow troopers are just regular stormtroopers spray-painted black. So over all if you own all of the sets for this year so far and you want them all then buy it, but if your lookin' to not waste a lot of money then don't buy it. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-07-28T16:16:58.793Z","The Star Wars Bow Tie ","Lego was obviously desperate when they made this set. Because they couldn't think up a set to re-release, they made one up!

great design

"MBlazier620","2009-12-22T17:58:09.733Z","Not Very Hot","Ok so whats the deal with this thing, its a tie fighter that doesn't fly but moves about on treads. So its not a tie fighter, its a tank of some sort. Now I do agree this set isn't featured in any of the movies but I assure you it wasn't created by lego. I looked back into my starwars comic collection and this particular vehicle is in fact used by the Empire. It serves after Darth Vader dies and the slow collapse of the Empire begins. Either way this sets design is very flawed, the side panels fall off easily and the supports connected to the cockpit are very weak. I cant count how many times I Face- Palmed myself while re-building this set because it falls apart easily, and I didn't buy this set used. I give the tie crawler a 3 although it has weak structure, It comes with dark-troopers and there aren't any stickers(Thank Goodness). If you do buy this set because your a collector like myself, I recommend that it is used for display only. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

I was wrong about it then and I regret buying it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the minifigures are nice and the best part of this set. The Shadow troopers as they are called, are very cool and are a great addition to the Empire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the TIE Crawler tank is not a great addition to have. After I was done building it, some of the pieces started to fall off and after I rebuilt it, it would happen again!! After a while, I had enough and left it as it is, the only Star Wars set I own that is not 100% intact. The pieces are great if you want to build another TIE related vehicle or use the treads for a tank. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, I regret buying this set and all I can tell you is to not buy this set.<br>",TRUE,1,5,2,2,1

<h4>Box/instructions</h4>
<p>The box art makes this set look really cool. It shows the tie crawler zooming along the plains of Naboo with it's weapons armed. It looks pretty cool and shows all the good things about this set. The instructions are mistake free.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The minifigures are one of the few reasons to buy this set. Contained in this set are two&nbsp;super cool&nbsp;shadow troopers. They are black stormtroopers with silver printing. There is only room for one in the tie crawler but that is not a problem.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build is incredibly frustrating. The connections between the cockpit and the sides are very weak and is constantly falling off. Also when building the side panels it is incredibly frustrating. There is no support so all the panels break off and it is incredibly difficult to rebuild. Pulling your hair out is more enjoyable then building this.</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>Is horrible. It will fall apart and is no fun. There is also no oppsition for the shadow troopers so this set is no fun if you want to play with it.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Looks really good on display. That is the only use for this set. It looks cool and it has shadow troopers. Nothing else to say about it.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>

"psychman7","2013-08-28T21:29:33.7Z","Star Wars Set #10: 7664 TIE Crawler","This is it. The big ten. And it's a very great set!<div><br></div><div><b>Box/Instructions:</b></div><div>It was a fairly large box, with lots of content. It shows the crawler with the cockpit more towards the rear, guns blazing. The set itself certainly does justice to the appearance on the box. As for the instructions, this was the first set where two instruction manuals were included. The first manual constructs the cockpit and one of the treads. The second builds the second tread and the missile mounted at the bottom of the craft.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Pieces:</b></div><div>As you may expect from some of these ground sets, this one includes a butt-load of treads. One hundred sixty-two, to be exact. It's not the sandcrawler from 2005 (which had two hundred seventy-two), but it's still a lot. It uses a lot of pieces a standard TIE fighter would use, but it also has a few others.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigures:</b></div><div>The set includes two shadow stormtroopers. They never showed up in any of the movies, but black stormtroopers are pretty awesome. Just possessing armor like that would be the coolest thing ever.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The TIE Crawler:</b></div><div>I will admit that this is a VERY cool ship. Or vehicle, whatever you may call it. It's pretty loaded with features. The cockpit can open up to fit one shadow stormtrooper. It's a pretty spacious cockpit, with plenty of room to breathe. Mounted below the cockpit is a flick-fire missile, and not the kind that's used now, but the kind that was used back in '07. It's not a great flick-fire missile (when have they ever been great?), but it's as good as it's gonna get. It does look cool. The detailing on the rear of the cockpit is also very cool. The stick with four domes is almost like a handle you can hang on to to move it forward and backward. Moving on to the treads, you will see right away that they can rotate 360 degrees. I prefer them when they stick out in front of the cockpit, but it's entirely up to you. I've also driven it when the cockpit towers above the ground, and that looks pretty great. The treads help move the vehicle forward and backward, and they work best on carpet. On the side of the treads are hidden guns that flip out for a surprise attack. They work very effectively. An extra feature that I made up is removing the entire outer section of the tread and putting an extra stormtrooper in there. Because of how thick the treads are, it actually works quite well. Overall, a very neat vehicle!</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Final Verdict:</b></div><div>Pieces - 10/10 - Great piece choices, especially the treads.</div><div>Minifigures - 10/10 - Black stormtroopers. Enough said.</div><div>TIE Crawler - 9/10 - The flick missile docked points.</div><div><br></div><div>Final result - 9.67/10. It's a great vehicle all in all!</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Kabba","2018-05-30T15:28:24.977Z","(KAB) Good, The Bag, and The Ugly","<p><strong>BUILDING</strong></p>

<p>The set building wise was somewhat of a snore, I have never enjoyed repetitious&nbsp;builds, and this is what it exactly is. The track part is what really brought me to a snore during building, but the cockpit was slightly enjoyable to build, but that is the best I can&nbsp;say about building.</p>

<p><strong>PARTS</strong></p>

<p>This set offers you amazing parts, the track pieces are hard too find in general, and this set gives you a&nbsp;<em>huge</em>&nbsp;amount of them (I forget the exact amount, but I know its above 50 treads), other than that, you only get some awkward blue pieces and black pieces, with some gray pieces and lots of technic pieces.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>This set to my disappointment is a very fragile set, being held together by a two long technic roads and some 4x4 round pieces.</p>

<p>The set commonly came loose around the 4x4 pieces due too the weight there supporting, leaving only the technic piece to hold it together, also the retractable turrets on the outside of the track commonly broke off when retracting them, making me ignore the function entirely to avoid fixing it.</p>

<p><strong>VALUE FOR THE MONEY</strong></p>

<p>The set is now a very very collectible set and a specific set, making it rather expensive.</p>

<p>So purchasing this set for parts is questionable, but you do however get 2 shadow troopers and a large amount of tread pieces.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL</strong></p>

<p>The set is in overall not that good. For display its fine, but even then it feels very aged and lack luster, along with it being fragile and nearly impossible to play with.</p>

<p>Overall, I am somewhat sad with the set, I myself had a huge hope for this set when buying it for $89.98 on ebay, and it was somewhat of a flunk in general, and expensive.</p>
