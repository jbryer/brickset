"legospongepotter","2010-04-19T12:47:35.95Z","My Review","<p>My last review was more like a review from memory so niw that I actually own this, I can make a real review. (note to owner of this website: please delete my last review for this set).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So anyway, this set is suberb. I'll start with the other objects. </p>
<p>*The two robots, Spongebob Robot and Customer Robot were awesome. They weren't really in any episodes so i'm glad Lego added them. </p>
<p>*Now the tank. It appeared in Atlantis Squarepantis so I really thought it was cool to have. </p>
<p>*The burger walker was also awesome, sort of like a spider made of burger. </p>
<p>*Spongebob and Plankton were cool. The helmet on Plankton is basically to protect him if anything blows up, while Spongebob's scared expression is funny.</p>
<p>*The red and blue catapult was okay, though I doubt I'd use it much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for the Chum Bucket itself</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros:</li>
<li>*Karen, Plankton's wife hangs from the wall and was cool</li>
<li>*Krabby Patty analyzer is awesome and just fits a Krabby Patty, but it's difficult to get out. </li>
<li>*A brainwashing deive for Spongebob to stand in while the robot Spongebob lays on some other device, waiting to change brains.</li>
<li>*Brainwashign devices spins</li>
<li>*The fist on top of the Chum Bucket was difficult to get on the Chum Bucket, but still a fun build</li>
<li>Cons:</li>
<li>Stickers fall off a little from this toxic barrel</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li></li></ul>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
