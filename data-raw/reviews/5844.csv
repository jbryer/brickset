"Xwing250","2008-01-31T12:09:53.437Z","Not the Best!","The only bad problem about this set is the road. For a start the ropes holding everything together kept coming off. Also, the first obsticale where the road narrows is imposssible to get through! It is neither like the real thing because it is far too short and they should have used a roadbase plate! Although this set is not all bad, because the lighthouse and school room are good and you get a Mrs Puff Minifigure.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This thing is the star of the show:
The design of the boat is so, that the mass is too much in the front - on purpose! So if you wind it up and let it go, it will not go straight but will mostly go in small circles due to spinning back wheels. It really looks like a motorboat going on water. And it is a perfect depiction of Spongebob's driving skills ;-P
Easily you can build a normal car, which will go more straight, but it won't be as funny.

Next - the house of the driving school:
It has some parts in rare medium blue but the main attraction is the MOC-like 2-colored roof: dark grey and rare dark blue! A beauty and best practice!
Also very creative: The 2 rare white clams as seats

Last but not least: The lighthouse:
It is much more slim & elegent than the rather stout one from 7739 - moreover red beats orange, I think.
Nice & simple construction of the rotating light.

The track is a suggestion to me - I guess everyone can rebuild it and rebuild the car/boat in order to let Spongebob pass after several attempts ;-)

I did not plan to buy it, but it was on sale 25% off. So watch out and grab it as long as there are still some forgotten ones in the shelves of some stores.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
