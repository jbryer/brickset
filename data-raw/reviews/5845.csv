"Irene","2007-06-11T08:44:11.733Z","Last part of up late","I just want to add a couple of more comments. 

Other posters, who looked at only the photos, thought that the walls looked strange.   

All of the buildings in this set hinge closed. Hence, the photos, which show them open, show interior walls and arches. 

If the side walls are swung closed, the outside facing walls look fine. 

The figures are in standard uniforms. My only assumption is that Amazon is using a &quot;mock up&quot; of the box image. I'm guessing that in some stage of the production, they used older Potter universe heads &amp; bodies when creating the box image. These were replaced with the latest and greatest before Lego went to press. Lego and Millenium sites show the colors that I received. 

Some time soon, I'm going to figure out where on my Hogwarts Model I can fit the new parts of the castle. Then I'll have to add a few more green base plates &amp; snug these new towers in [Room of requirements is on the seventh floor, so maybe I can fit the new mini tower above something else.]",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"legolander","2007-09-25T04:32:53.043Z","Another review...","       I think this is the sixth time that I'll be making  a review of the same set. Well, I actually finished building the entire castle three days ago. It took me about 6 hours to construct everything. I started opening and building early in the afternoon. but then, the whole afternoon wasn't enough for me to do everything. Anyway, what I like about this set is that it has provided a lot of accessories compared to the previous version of Hogwarts Castle. My opinion regarding the towers and other constructions is still the same so my rating will probably be the same as well. I didn't like the sticker sheet system. Although it has some spare stickers, I still disapprove of this style because it makes the designing and contruction much more difficult. Another flaw is the holes or gaps that I have mentioned in my other review. It made the castle look weak and easy to invade. But then, I liked the details of the Room of Requirements. Everything in it is great specially the gold accessories. The minifigs are still okay but then, I'm wondering why Ron looks old and Hermione looks mean. Oh well, I guess nothing can be perfectly made. Another thing that I disliked is the left wing of the main castle. The green bed does not fit that part so I redecorated it. The green house is so neat. Now it can go perfectly with Hagrid's hut. The target thing should have just been made as the death eater dummy instead of a useless stand. They could have just used the black masked minifigure as the practice dummy in the Room of Requirement. Other than those things that I've mentioned, I think this set is good especially if you are in need of castle parts and towers. I raise my rating to 3.5 out of 5 stars!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"BonkersBricks","2008-01-04T23:15:46.873Z","Great set, needed Luna","This was a great buy for me, being a huge Harry Potter fan myself. I wish they had released more than one set for Order of the Phoenix, but I like how with this one set they kind of included minisets of others they would have released. If Lego HAD released multiple sets, they probably would have had the Room of Requirement, Umbridge's office, and Thestrals, which were all included in this big set. My only real complaint with having only one set is the lack of the Ministry of Magic, where a large chunk of the movie takes place.

-Minifigs: 9 great, detailed minifigs. The Death Eater and Umbridge were really detailed and accurate, I love these minifigures. I think it should have had Luna instead of Malfoy though, because Malfoy had hardly any screen time in the movie, and Luna was very prominent in the movie. Her character also could have brought a Ravenclaw body to the Lego world.

-Greenhouse: This greenhouse was great, despite being three movies late. The mandrakes were cool even though they didn't match their depiction is the second film. A nice little additon, but I would rather have had a part of the ministry.

-Small castle: I'm guessing the bottom part was is the Room of Requirement, and I guess adding the stupid target toy was the best this set could have had considering how bland the room is in the film. There could have at least been a fireplace. I'm glad a set finally has an owlery in it too!

-Large castle: This castle is fantastic. The entry hall had a great knight piece with a secret ancient meassage which is pretty cool. The axes over the door were a nice touch too. Sirius in the flames is cool since it was a scene in Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix. Is the room on the bottom right supposed to be Snape's office, where he teaches Harry Occlumency? That's what I assumed. Kind of weird, but this office has some cool pieces to make interesting, like the blue lightning-type thing. The dormitory was useless and boring. Dumbledore's office is cool, but seeing as there is already a set from the second movie for it, they could have replaced it with something else. I would have liked an O.W.L. examination hall and fireworks, even if it isn't correctly placed in Hogwarts. Umbridge's office was perfect, including the locked up broom from the book! Finally, the telescope makes no sense, unless it is supposed to be from the Astronomy exam in the book. I don't see why it owuld be though, the telscopes were outside on a tower and never being close to referenced in the films. I can't think of anything better to replace it with though, so I guess it's a nice touch.

This is a great Lego set, and would definately recommend buying it. What irritates me most is that Luna isn't here. There's already a Draco minifig, and he's hardly in this movie, so give us Luna! I would have really liked some part of the Ministry too since there is only one set for this movie. But yes, it's a really great set and fun to play with.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-03-28T16:43:15.84Z","Somewhat of a Let Down","<p>I was expecting this Harry Potter set to be a lot better than it turned out to be. First off, the only worthful&nbsp;part of the set is the greenhouse and the new minifigs. The castle itself is disappointing&nbsp;and frankly is the worst of the three Harry Potter castles. Practically every wall has gaps and holes that make the set appear very unrealistic. Even worse&nbsp;is the pathetic playability. The most it offers you is a book that pops out from under a bed. How absurdly amazing! If you buy Legos just for the minifigs, I suggest buying this. If not, don&#39;t.</p>

"Stash","2008-10-03T03:01:35.467Z","A superb set with the only major flaw being that I wanted just a bit more.....","There is quite a bit to discuss about this set, so I will break it down into sections. 

What you get:

The Hogwarts Order of the Phoenix castle set comes with 943 pieces and 2 instruction manuals. The build produces 3 distinct buildings with numerous parts and components which I will discuss in detail. 

What's in the box:

Opening the box you get the 2 manuals, a sticker sheet, and about 6 individual bags of parts, some of which have smaller sealed bags inside of them. Yeah, there is a sticker sheet, but overall there are very few pieces that really require the use of the stickers and for the most part they can be avoided without detracting much from the set. I used about half of them, and they were mostly easy to apply. 

Mini-figs:

This set is fairly loaded, with 9 mini-figs, 2 horses, 2 mandrake root heads, and 1 blank knight (no legs, but armor, grey torso, and blank grey head). The figs you get are-

Hagrid, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter, Death Eater, Hermione Granger, Dumbledore, Snape, and Umbridge. I would have liked to see professor Sprout considering we got the greenhouse, but it is hard to complain about figure inclusion when you have a list like this. The death eater, mandrake roots, and  are the highlights of the figure assortment. 

For accessories you get 2 broomsticks, hagrid gets a crossbow, and there are a few other odds and ends not specifically related to the figures like goblets and such (nice color assortment). There are also 4 wands that go in the wand holders.

There are some nice exclusive figures in this set in the form of Umbridge, the mandrakes, and the Death Eater (I think....). Some of the minifigs have dual head designs as well so you can rotate them if you want, though they appear to be sleeping, or have their eyes closed for some other reason. Hard to complain about something extra though.

***********************************************************************************

Part 1 - The Greenhouse:

This is, on the whole, my favorite part of the set. The build is clear and concise with great instructions. The thing about this part of the set that really wins me over is that it completely seals as a building. The greenhouse is hinged, so the two halves fully open to reveal the inside, but they close completely and leave no cracks or openings and the building looks really nice. The roof is clear glass and there are windows all around the side. 

The inside of the greenhouse is sparse with plants, mushrooms, and a blackboard (sticker) talking about the mandrake roots. Yes! You get 2 really awesome mandrake root &quot;minifigs&quot;. The heads are an original minifig design and are really nice pieces to get, and you stick one of the large 3 leaf plants on top and there you go. These 2 little heads are just a few of some of the really nice exclusive pieces in this set. 
**********************************************************************************


Part 2 - Castle Segment

This is the second phase of the building which runs through to the end of the first manual and through part of the second. You end up with what appears to be the room of requirement on the bottom spanning both sides, an owl roost on either side at the top of the towers, a wand room on one side, and a table with two stools on the other. Three floors in all, but the topmost parts of the tower can hardly really be called floors. 

The build on this part was also pretty straightforward and easy. Two stickers are used on two columns which make them appear to have monogrammed drapes. I used the stickers here since they add quite a bit to the scenery. The building is nice but it feels pretty empty. I would like to see bigger rooms and more in them. I will discuss that at the end though.

A neat feature of this part of the castle is that between the hinges on the wall segments is a tiny segment that appears to span the gap in the two wall segments, making it appear fairly continuous when viewed from &quot;outside&quot; the castle and helping it to appear complete on the inside. It is a pretty nice effect and is pulled off well in this build.

***********************************************************************************

Part 3 - The main castle:

The build on this was interesting, and the result is pretty interesting too. On one hand, you wind up with a castle that, when viewed from the front with the sides folded in, looks like a fairly complete and impressive tower but with gaps in the walls (they just left some pieces out since it was not structurally necessary, but would be aesthetically nice and a good idea to have). The tower does look pretty amazing for what it is though. Here, I would have liked to have seen a bigger door since it is the main door, but overall not a huge deal. 

Inside, you have 2 floors of rooms on the sides and 3 in the center. The center section has the entrance hallway on the bottom, a trophy room in the middle, and an astronomy center with telescope on top. This portion of the castle comes off really well. It is well designed and accessorized and if you wanted to flesh out the castle and connect things, you could probably do a good job starting off with this set. No real complaints here, other than how the general build progressed, which I will get to. 

The left hinged side has a fireplace with Sirius Black sticker face inside it on the first floor and a bed on the second (representing the dormitory). Not much to complain about here either, but also not much substance. The &quot;rooms&quot; are very very small and can fit 1-2 minifigs at the most (in the bedroom pretty much just one fig comfortably). 

The right hinged side has a lab/workshop on the bottom and Umbridge's office on the second floor. This side looks a lot better than the other one. The rooms have a ton of accessories and look well designed and conceptualized, but still not room for more than one minifig really in my opinion. 

The build on this section was pretty interesting. As you build each floor, it becomes progressively more unsteady, and because there are gaps in the walls and towers, you find yourself precariously placing pieces, either because there is no other way to do it at that point, or because the instructions have you placing pieces that would have been more easily placed a few steps prior. Once the build is finished it is very steady though and looks very good.

*************************************************************************************

Overall Thoughts:

I really like this castle. They did a lot very well with it, but left quite a bit out. I am starting to think that they need to design these castle/playset type things as a bigger collector's edition that would provide upwards of double the pieces but the end result would be infinitely greater through a larger area to work with and overall higher quality. Even with all the hogwarts sets you are still presented with gaps and things you have to work around. The sets were not designed to work together as modules even though they were designed in a modular fashion.

The appearance of this set is, still, quite nice. I have it folded up and I am looking at it from the outside, and already I have ideas how to make a really really nice castle tower (hogwarts theme aside) but I don't have the pieces to make this hogwarts castle what I would really really like it to be. 

Again I come back to why I love the greenhouse so much. It is modular, and as a building looks extremely well designed and finished and the inside can be remodeled for whatever. It isn't that big inside, but still very nice and there is room to work with.

What could be better? As always, I advocate printed legs, arms, and backs on the minifigs. More accessories for this number of figures would be good. I would have liked solid walls (if this set folded up and was completely sealed, it would be virtually flawless). That is really my only major gripe here, but I can see why they left out the wall pieces since structurally it is fine. It helps cut down on the cost. I don't think it would have taken much more than 20 pieces though, if that.

Even with the minor flaws, and they are somewhat numerous, but fairly unrelated (for the most part I would call them annoyances). I easily looked past them and enjoy the set very much. You get a lot of value for your money with this set and I highly recommend it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jonbuddy","2009-06-11T11:36:46.843Z","It's was a dissapointing year for Lego Harry Potter, but the set itself wasn't as dissapointing.","This is my first ""big"" review!

I. Introduction

In the sadness of it all, Lego Harry Potter (LHP) stopped it's marketing after making only one set in it's terrible year. Now, I can't say quite the same for this set, only because it has some really good stuff to it.

II. Mini-figs, Accesories, and Animals

You get 9 Mini-figs: Ron, Hermionie, Death Eater, Draco, Umbridge, Dumbledore, Snape, Hagrid, and of course Harry. For the Animals you have the Thestral (that flying black horse skeleton in the top right corner) and a Mandrake (although I'm not sure if a Mandrake is an Animal, more of a Creature), a Owl, and a Bat or two. For the Accesories, you have several wands for the Wizards, and a Bowcaster for Hagrid.

III. The Greenhouse

The lack of Professor Sprout is not all that great, but the greenhouse contains several interesting accersories and a creature: the Mandrake, a Chalkboard, a magnifying glass, a plant book, and plants, of course! :)

IV. The Castle Entrance Hall

You see that the front of the castle has some decoritive shelid with the Hogwarts(TM) insignia. You ""enter"" the castle and see a knight to your right and a room (possibly the mail room although that's actually somewhere on the school grounds) with a cool Purple-Blue Lightning Bolt on a table to the left. On your far right, although not seen in open view unless viewed from the backside, is a room with a fire place that Sirius can talk through to Harry, Ron and Hermionie.

Right above the fireplace room on the second story is Draco's sleeping quarters. Next to it is the Trophy Room for Quidditch winnings and other awards. Also to the right of the Trophy Room is Professor Umbridge's Office with the Plates with pictures of live cats on them. There is also a quill pen bottle and a perfume bottle (I think) on her table.

V. The Dumbledore's Army (DA) Meeting Spot

This is where the DA train to fight He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (Voldemort). There is a Reducto(TM) spell challenge with a worn target. Above it is a Wand holder and sitting area.

VI. Conclusion

This now concludes my LONG Review of 5738-1: Hogwarts Castle. I hoped you found it useful. Also, if you think the size of this set is too small, attempt to combine the previous castle sets. It might work, I don't know.

Rating:
Playability: 8/10
Size: 7/10
Detail: 7.5/10
Overall: 7.5/10

"JVM","2018-07-22T11:39:15.163Z","A serviceable but lacking rendition of Hogwarts","<p>The final regular release in the first run of the LEGO <em>Harry Potter</em> theme, and the third set released as <strong>Hogwarts Castle</strong>, set #5378 seeks to present itself as both an all-in-one playset with all of Hogwarts&#39; iconic characters and locations, while also adding a few special touches inspired by the then-upcoming film adaption of <em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>During the first several years of the LEGO <em>Harry Potter </em>theme, each new film would bring about new locations that could be built together to create a larger, more comprehensive castle. Instruction booklets for the first two films offered ways to create these castles. Removable roofs allowed sets to be placed on top of one another, simulating a multi-floor castle, and creating a sense of a larger building experience by placing these many sets together.</p>

<p>While the <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> introduced a new uniform and flesh tone for minifigures, and remade a few sets, the second edition Hogwarts Castle featured the new Clock Tower and largely did not retread established ground besides part of Gryffindor Tower. This evolution continued through the <em>Goblet of Fire</em> sets, which focused on new locations but also made small changes to minifigures, particularly new faces.</p>

<p>Hogwarts Castle #5378, however, was advertised by LEGO for upgrading the existing minifigure roster as well as featuring new versions of some previous Hogwarts locations, alongside a few new characters and locations from <em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</em> and the series as a whole. It was also announced as the only release from the franchise that year, as well as only the fifth set in three years, placing the additional responsibility of not only representing the new film but the theme as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There aren&#39;t a ton of interesting new parts here to notice, but there are a few highlights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A new, at the time, flame element, used for torches. I remember being surprised by the new addition when I first built it, although it&#39;s well established in LEGO fandom now.</li>
	<li>The Skeleton Horse introduced earlier the same year for the Castle theme plays the Thestral here. They also have special wings. It was a very special but bizarre piece, although they require clips, and those can break after long or rough play.</li>
	<li>A number of pearl gold elements on the middle floor of the main building, with Professor Dumbledore and Professor Umbridge&#39;s offices, including a perfume bottle.</li>
	<li>Both buildings use a castle roof element that lacks detail but is round and very practical for building purposes. It was first used in the previous castle but is used more liberally here, and was new to me at the time.</li>
	<li>Hermione Granger has a new hairpiece not previously used in a key licensed theme, and it&#39;s a piece that remains in use to this day, although like Ron&#39;s original hairpiece, it is no longer applied to the character it was first created for.</li>
	<li>There&#39;s a special headpiece x2 to represent the Mandrakes in the Herbology Classroom, topped with the old leafy piece.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more I&#39;m forgetting!</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The Hogwarts uniforms continue the look established in <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>, involving a dark gray body and matching legs, with the print depicting a tie corresponding to their house. The characters&#39; black outer robes are no longer represented by capes.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Harry Potter: </strong><em>Goblet of Fire </em>version. This iteration of Harry is serviceable within the style of the time but offers nothing special. His mouth always seems a little low to me on this print.</li>
	<li><strong>Ron Weasley: </strong><em>Goblet of Fire </em>version. Ron&#39;s trademark hairpiece is molded in a darker orange, making its last appearance with him, and he sport a two-sided head that offers a generic expression as well as a sleeping face, tying into the first release of the minifigure. The expression is a little odd, with maybe a wrinkle too many, but it works enough and portrays his somewhat goofy smile.</li>
	<li><strong>Hermione Granger: </strong>Upgrade. Like Ron, she sports a two-sided head with a clever smirk on one side and a second face sleeping, tying into its previous release in the same set, but she has an all-new hairpiece introduced only that year that is noticeable less bushy. The minifig doesn&#39;t look quite right though, as it comes from the 2007-09 era where female faces had a noticeably different visual style, with thinner features and details perhaps a bit too fine.</li>
	<li><strong>Draco Malfoy: </strong>Upgrade. Very similar to the previous version, Malfoy now sports a new head with a mischievous smirk, though sporting the same hair, wand and Slytherin uniform of previous releases.</li>
	<li><strong>Rubeus Hagrid: </strong><em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em> version. This remains a solid upgrade on the first version of the character, with articulated arms and hands, as well as brighter coloration.</li>
	<li><strong>Albus Dumbledore:</strong> <em>Goblet of Fire </em>version. Dumbledore has a flesh version of the same head he&#39;s had since the line began, however these recent films have replaced his familiar purple-pink robes with a sand blue outfit that better resembles the later films&#39; version of the character, played by Michael Gambon. Like Ron, it&#39;s a serviceable look but feels less innovative.</li>
	<li><strong>Severus Snape: </strong>New. A much more film-inspired version of the character, Snape now has flesh tone instead of the glow-in-the-dark customary to previous versions. His new face print has some stringy hairs printed on, which looks absolutely wonderful. The purple toned outfit design is replaced with an almost entirely black one with a little purple detail. This minifigure has less of a unique character to itself than the previous version but is still very detailed and accurate. This is also one of the last times the original &#39;long hair&#39; piece was used for a licensed character.</li>
	<li><strong>Dolores Umbridge: </strong>New. Harry Potter&#39;s most infamous character, Umbridge is a finely crafted minifigure with a special unique hairpiece, her trademark pink outfit, and a bit of a haughty look akin to the &#39;toad&#39; described. The overall minifig is a very strong representation of the source character and still looks comfortable next to many relatively recent minifigures, although it&#39;s only just now beginning to show some age, especially with a similar, more detailed hairpiece recently introduced.</li>
	<li><strong>Death Eater: </strong>New. This otherwise unremarkable figure sports a really cool mask headpiece, lacking any other printing and using common components. A printed torso would&#39;ve done a lot, but even so, for me it was easily upstaged by a Voldemort minifig as it is now.</li>
	<li><strong>Thestrals: </strong>New. These creatures make use of the new skeleton horse mold and wings connected by a clip piece. Removing the wings often will eventually cause the clip to lose it&#39;s clutch.</li>
	<li>There is also the upper portion of a blank <strong>Knight</strong> on the ground floor protecting the castle&#39;s secrets.</li>
</ul>

<p>As this is the only set released for <em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</em>, and the only <em>Harry Potter</em> set released in an almost five year span, it&#39;s clear that LEGO wants to create a comprehensive <em>Harry Potter</em> castle that includes every character they assume a casual fan might need, and indeed, the minifigure selection is eerily similar to that of the very first Hogwarts Castle, bringing back nearly all of the franchise&#39;s central characters from that early set, save Peeves, and adding two additional minifigures. The key players have all been given satisfactory upgrades and certainly feel &#39;fresh&#39;.</p>

<p>The downside is the set feels a little lacking in selection relative to the included locations - chiefly, Professor Sprout did not exist to tend to her Herbology Classroom, and was not produced for a further four years, though she did not appear in <em>Order of the Phoenix</em>. While I love Hagrid, he plays a relatively small role in this film as well, and Malfoy and Dumbledore are a bit understated as well - more significant are Neville, Luna, and Ginny, all of whom are excluded here.</p>

<p>(It may be worth noting that while these upgraded minifigures were attractive and exciting at the time, they have all been relatively bested since, with a new Umbridge on the way later this year, reducing their viability as an added value to tracking down the set today.)</p>

<p>The minifigure selection, in short, hedges towards trying to be comprehensive towards the larger theme but suffers a little in crafting characters of specific relevance, particularly new ones.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>After owning this set over ten years, I honestly remember next to nothing about the building process, I&#39;m sorry to report.</p>

<p>I made a significant mistake in the building process and used black baseplates for the bottom floor, and gray ones for the middle floor, and only corrected this a few weeks ago. This makes a little sense, as the ground floor has almost always been rendered gray in Harry Potter sense, and therefore both the middle floor and roof areas all use black... but after so long looking at the original orientation, the correct look still seems &#39;wrong&#39; to me to this day.</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model (main castle)</strong></p>

<p>The main castle building is grand and looks beautiful from both the interior and exterior. The lion faces, shields, flames and stained glass give it a special look to break up a typical castle, but the outside is held back a little by gaps in the walls big enough for a minifigure to peek out - this seems clearly by design, and is seen on the box, but with so many of these, it still doesn&#39;t look satisfactory. I also personally felt like we should&#39;ve had one more piece for the top of the center castle spire.</p>

<p>The interior offers three rooms per floor, although when the castle is folded/closed, the middle floor almost resembles a single room floor, although each side plate only offers room for one or two minifigures to be displayed. A number of iconic locations are nonetheless included - the bottom floor has the fireplace from the Gryffindor Common Room, the Entrance Hall, and a third room I&#39;ll describe in a moment. The third room was identified in a contemporary LEGO magazine as Snape&#39;s Potions Classroom or Office, but in the DK Building the Magical World publication, is referred to as the Restricted Section of the Library.</p>

<p>The Knight can be removed by someone to show off some hidden knowledge as a play feature, although the story applications seem a little curious. The Gryffindor Common Room area is represented chiefly by a fireplace here, which has Sirius&#39; image and makes for an interesting play feature, as it can be hidden by moving the flames around. The final room contains two tables, with a crystal ball, a piece of lightning, and a bottle, and a mailing box with some letters. I personally viewed it as Snape&#39;s office myself, as there are no books to remind me of the library, and Snape&#39;s office was relevant in the fifth film via Occlumency classes.</p>

<p>The middle floor has a Slytherin dormitory, represented by a single brick-built bed, with a play feature to reveal a book for some reason -- this doesn&#39;t feel like it adds much play value though. We also have&nbsp;Umbridge&#39;s Office, which features a hidden cupboard, with printed kitten teacups, and a desk -- reminding me of her confiscating Harry&#39;s firebolt in the corresponding novel, although this was cut from the film. The larger section is referred to as a Trophy Room in the DK book, and Dumbledore&#39;s Office in LEGO magazine, but the Trophy Room look feels more accurate, and it has a lot of cool pieces.</p>

<p>The next floor up is mostly the top of the castle, empty but with space to display minifigures, thestrals, or small creatures, and a telescope inside the central tower. It&#39;s hard to say what use the Telescope is supposed to be here, aiming through a window, and there&#39;s little space for a minifigure to consult. In addition, Hogwarts&#39; Astronomy Tower is actually a separate building, contrary to some of these early LEGO depictions. The final floor is essentially an attic inside of the spire, and offers space for one minifigure and no play.</p>

<p>The castle certainly covers a lot of ground, but many of the locations included - the Trophy Room/Dumbledore&#39;s Office, the Potions area, the Gryffindor and Slytherin common areas, and the Astronomy area - all exist in other or separate sets, usually with more detail than seen here, so little of it feels fresh or exciting. The common areas aren&#39;t placed terribly well either, as the Gryffindor Common Room is usually in it own tower, higher up, while the Slytherin common room is in the dungeons. Like the minifigure selection, the set tries so hard to be comprehensive that it falls a little short of capturing any one thing especially well.</p>

<p>For some reason, rotating pieces are used to link the castle turret pieces in the Trophy Room, allowing some limited movement of the turrets.</p>

<p>As has been a trend in Harry Potter sets since this release, the building&#39;s interior space is a little cramped and most furnished rooms can only fit one or two minifigures, with the Trophy Room and Entrance Hall offering space for a little more. This is most jarring in Snape&#39;s Office and the Fireplace areas, as the supports take up space as well.</p>

<p><strong>Completed Models (additional buildings)</strong></p>

<p>The second castle building is easily the most disappointing part of the set - from the outside, there&#39;s a significant gap at the side of the building covered only by a hinged wall, and why this choice was made I cannot understand. The DK book refers to this as a hidden entrance but the wall does not cover both sides of the hinge, so the entrance exists either way. This building generally represents the Room of Requirement, a key location, although it&#39;s spread out and</p>

<p>The interior of this bottom floor is empty, allowing some room for Dumbledore&#39;s Army to practice spells, and has some interesting building to include torches and represent a stonier section of the castle than usually depicted in the theme, and opening up allows for it to feel somewhat naturally like the Room of Requirement, though it feels a little indistinctive beyond the Hogwarts banners. The lackluster second floor is limited to en enclosed Castle Tower, with a &#39;Vanishing Cabinet&#39; that only really allows to store wands and spins, and across from that, a table and chairs that don&#39;t look very natural when used by minifigures - the table is simply too short. The top section contains some owl posts. Theae areas offer little to no room overall for minifigs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s surprising that the Herbology Classroom, barely playing a role in most of the films, is so well-crafted for its trivial nature. Details like the chalkboard reinforce this as a classroom, yet there are plenty of plants and the ugly mandrakes present, and just enough room to house both a teacher and two or three students... in addition, it closes like a modular, allowing it to be displayed more ways than one. I was delighted how much detail it lacked into such a small building, and it makes for a highlight to the set despite not connecting at all to the film or novel being portrayed and lacking any corresponding useful minifigures.</p>

<p>Finally, a small additional build offers a place to practice spellcasting, and has a cute play function - the figure can turn slightly on the base to cause a target to drop.</p>

<p><strong>Complete Set</strong></p>

<p>The complete set certainly looks nice - the largest building has a grand feel, and the stony bottom area adds some texture to the usual tan and sand green pieces for the upper floors, and the smaller buildings certainly do the job of complimenting the larger one. The set certainly looks and at first like an expansive and comprehensive set, containing many rooms inspired by and characters from the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, but closer inspection be trays many of these elements.</p>

<p>The pieces do not connect together in any way as was publicized during the early years of the theme, or would become customary in the subsequent revivals. They simply sit together. The &#39;secret entrance&#39; door from the Room of Requirement building can be made to appear as a connecting wall with the castle though.</p>

<p>An interesting point of note is that the larger castle can be folded together to reduce its footprint, which I found a useful asset over the years. After removing the Slytherin bed from the set, it was even somewhat playable in this state, with the mid-level functioning entirely as Umbridge&#39;s Office for display purposes when closed. The upper deck also remains accessible when it is folded together. None of the other castles offer this function as well as this one.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Here, I would like to divide my points into a simple bulleted list of what is best and worst about the set.</p>

<p><em>Pros</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Fairly comprehensive of iconic characters and locations.</li>
	<li>Herbology Classroom stands out as extremely well done.</li>
	<li>Exclusive Dolores Umbridge and Death Eater minifigures.</li>
	<li>Interesting play features like Umbridge&#39;s Cupboard and Spellcasting Arena.</li>
	<li>Creative rendition of the Thestrals.</li>
	<li>Main castle folds to reduce physical footprint.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Cons</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Several unsightly gaps in Castle walls from exterior.</li>
	<li>Small interior area limits playability.</li>
	<li>Room of Requirement building has few points of interest.</li>
	<li>Minifigure selection is primarily upgrades and lacks new characters.</li>
	<li>Exclusive elements largely outclassed by later Harry Potter releases.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>This set is trying to be a few things at once -- a comprehensive set for the <em>Harry Potter</em> theme and franchise as a whole, and a flagship set for the release of <em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</em>. Elements from the new film are among those that stand out best, such as Professor Umbridge and her office, including her locking cupboard, as well as the new Thestrals, but the Room of Requirement still feels a little underdeveloped, and Sirius&#39; counsel is other underserved as well. These competing goals undermine and undercut the set&#39;s total value.</p>

<p>Many of the other areas referenced, however, are subpar at best, few impressive, and some choices outright baffling. The fireplace is fun on its own but has no value as the Gryffindor Common Room, being so small and on the bottom floor for some reason, and similarly, we&#39;ve seen several better Astronomy Towers, which is usually its own building. The Slytherin dormitory is a baffling choice, resting strangely in the middle of the class, with room for one bed and a subpar play feature.</p>

<p>The other highlight is the Herbology Classroom, which also feels barren without relevant characters. A new rendition of Neville Longbottom might&#39;ve been a good minifig choice, as he is connected to both the Room of Requirement and the Herbology Classroom, and plays an especially significant role in <em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</em> as well.</p>

<p>The best use of this set would be as an entry-level castle fo someone new to theme who couldn&#39;t go back to purchase previous iterations, but while this is a fine set that can be serviceable for someone new to the theme, and I enjoyed it for hours when it came out, it&#39;s hard to recommend someone go back to track this one down with its current inflated secondary market value. Better versions of these locations, characters, and thestrals all exist by now, and you could probably bricklink the pieces for the wonderful Greenhouse in the meantime.</p>

<p>In short, I find this a solidly serviceable set, but one that ultimately offers <em>very</em> little that makes it truly special.</p>
