<p>Our only complaint is that we were limited by the small number of plates. We bought a separate set of coordinating 8x8 and 8x16 plates, which made the set seem more complete. It gave our little animal-loving Lego enthusiast endless possibilities for her Duplo landscapes and tree houses.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pricey set, for sure! But after 5 years of rough handling, all pieces are like new. Definitely worth the investment! When she&#39;s ready to give it up, we&#39;ll have no trouble selling it for a decent price.</p>
