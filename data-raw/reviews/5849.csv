By changing the walls to medium blue, DUPLO designed this playhouse for those who wanted a playhouse not in pink.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>If you manage to find one of these sets for sale, you have hit pay dirt! My used copy popped up on eBay US one day, and I pounced on it. If I ever see another one for sale, I would buy it in a minute, too. Both the pink and blue sets are wonderful for building a DUPLO city for yourself and/or the kids.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The design is first class...very solid walls and roof pieces on thick baseplates. The family fits right into this cute house, which is larger than the pink 4966 version. You can build the free standing garage or add a room to the house. And my favorite matching medium blue car looks fabulous parked out front roaring to go for a drive through Duploville.</div><div><br></div><div>This set is a fantastic buy because it is quite sturdy and should last through several generations. Please keep teething children away from it because it is difficult replacing the parts they may damage. And do keep this set inside away from sunlight and paint sets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you, LEGO, for providing such a fine playhouse set. Please introduce more sets in similar pastel colors so all our DUPLO folks have a place to live. They are tired of being cooped up in our storage containers and deserve a place of their own after all these years.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
