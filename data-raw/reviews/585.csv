Then this is for you - if you can find it, that is, as Unitron were given a pretty raw deal, were never released outside the US (apart from that monorail).  Anyway, this vehicle moves on wheels of three ascending sizes, a clever and original design.  There are two ascending cockpits, the higher of which is a small craft which can be removed to allow the radar dish to move forward.  A nice set, with plenty of good pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Don't get me wrong - yay to Lego for trying new things - but just because it's different doesn't mean it's actually any good, and I think the whole tiered wheeling system is proof of that. Another thing Lego are trying is the whole cockpit redesign - rather than going for 1x2 panels to accomodate minifig arms they use slopes which leave the cockpits gaping open. Now, I don't have a huge problem with the practicality of open cockpits, after all the minifigs are always suited up, but it really doesn't look as good. On the other hand, although the detachable cockpit/spaceship thing is nothing new, it has the radar dish array type thing that swings up to fill the void the cockpit leaves - that is something Lego should definitely do more often. Unfortunately, the method used to attach the cockpit isn't very good, half the time it will come away with one or both of the jumper plates. As with the other strange American exclusive series of four Roboforce, the construction leans towards the slapdash, it just doesn't seem as coherent as, say, M:Tron or Space Police I. It effects the colour scheme too, while the colours themselves work, the placing of them in the construction looks randomised, like some pieces have been lost and replaced by ones of alternate colours. A brave experiment, if pretty much a failed one.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The unitron figures are just plain sweet.  The way this set uses the three different types of hard plastic wheels kind of bugs me.  THe color scheme some how bothers me, but I can never figure out why.  The little pod that detaches off the top is when I like this set.  It looks so much cooler without the pod on the top.  Thats a pet peive of mine about this particular set.  The pod should be placed farther back then it is.  When the radar dish in the back folds down over the back section once the pod is off, the set looks much better in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong here, this set rocks.  If only the design of the two cockpits was different.  This set is still a must have and a great space set.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-03-31T11:56:29.817Z","Unite!","There are only 4 Unitron sets - a space jet, a monorail, a base and this land vehicle.  What is cool is that the wheels are of 3 different sizes.  What is even cooler is that the part that becomes a jet can be carried on the monorail.  The radar dish/engines at the rear of the vehicle is a bit weird though.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-12-03T17:11:43.483Z","Hmmm...","This set is decent but not perfect. Its not very futuristic and it hasn't the best design. It is what you would call ugly. Star Hawk 2 is actually the much cooler of the two unitron vehicles, buy that instead of this one, which is quite boring.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-08-20T11:41:15.733Z","Awkward but good","If anyone tells you this set sucks, they're probably wrong. For its size it's a good deal, plus it comes with a pair of each (but one) of the four wheel sizes. Two minifigures fit this set well, and the design is pretty cool. The detachable cockpit is also pretty cool but does not compat with all of the other sets (but the star hawk II cockpit fits fine on it, upping the playability), though the set lacks tools other than the two shorter antennae, losing the four it could have had. The set can easily be rebuilt and the two smaller antennae can be used as mock missiles. Overall, you should have this set in your colletion if you can find one for $15 or under (if you find one complete for $10, that's a steal!).",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Limited build and reasonable parts. Playability scored a 4 as I had the monorail!</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,3
