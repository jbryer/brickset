Each card comes with a close-up photo of the pieces in action, and on the back are the directions to one vehicle in the picture.  It is fairly easy to interpret the photos to build the exact same thing.  

The eight pictures are of the following scenes:  CASTLE with tour bus and tourists, FARM with hay bales, sheep, combine &amp; tractor, FIRE STATION with vehicles, BOAT DOCK  with bay and boats, HOSPITAL with ambulance &amp; a little construction going on on the side, POLICE STATION with helicopter and vehicles, BUS/TRAIN TERMINAL with no shortage of appropriate vehicles, and AIRPORT with planes.  One fun thing about the vehicles is that some actually work, in micro!  The dump truck dumps, for example.   Also, all of the vehicle wheels travel seemlessly between the baseplate studs, so you can zoom them along and they will stay in their tracks.

There are also some downloadable lessons for very young children, based on the 8 idea cards.

This set is geared toward children 4+, which seems a little young to me.  After using it with my son, I am thinking 6+ is more accurate.  Micro-building is a very exciting new way to build with Lego and if not introduced to it before, some habits need to be broken, like the constant search for bigger bricks.  There are 16  16&quot; x 16&quot; baseplates, (4 Bright Green and 12 Dark Stone).  The boat scene baseplates are made with smaller blue plates, if you were wondering.

I gave this a 4 and not a 5 because it is so expensive and very little detail from Lego Education on this set.  The only way to find out about it is to buy it.  I hope to post the inventory of this set and pictures of the cards soon to Peeron.com so you can see for yourself.  For me personally, it was worth it!  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
