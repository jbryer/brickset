"rnychka","2009-01-03T01:47:49.187Z","The best combination","I have to say, we own both the retail version and the education version, and the education version in combination with the resource set is by far the best solution.  The software is great, and at the lego education site there is also a homeschool robotics program available.  We have a huge collection and sometimes having separate organizers for the pieces are great.  It comes with lamps and also the rechargeable battery, and the extra touch sensor which is great for placing one in front and behind.

This definitely needs the resource set 9648 to go with it, and it is a bit pricer with everything, but it really opens the doors and I think this is the better option in the long run since the kids will be more interested.  Of course with NXT in general, I highly recommend an additional book for extra models.  If you are buying this for your children make certain that they have a roadmap so their imagination is broader.  If you are buying for yourself, the investment is worth it.
