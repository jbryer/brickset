"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-26T17:45:49Z","Strange","Yeah, it's really strange, I'm a huge fan of the subtheme Islanders. Have every set twice... And this week I found out that there's a set called 1788, with a canoe and two minifigs of that theme I love...

Maybe this set has never been released in my little country... That's why I didn't know of its excistence.

If you have a piece, I want to buy it!!

Though it's not a conventional-looking pirate set, it's still nice.  The main model comes with a hidden compartment for treasure, a moving cannon and plenty of little features such as a lit stove and a torch.  Included is a pirate raft and an Islander canoe packed with their various trademarks such as head-dresses, animal-skin drum, etc.  This is a rare set, but certainly worth looking for.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

You get two Islander minifigs, two pirate minifigs, an island, a raft, canoe, croc, and so much more. I really like the raft in this set because it is so detailed. This should have been rereleased because it is such a good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2013-05-14T14:39:32.85Z","Great Islanders set, wonderfull box !","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : This is in my opinion the last set of the Islanders theme, but a very good and complete one. It looks a bit like a set composted with left over parts of the theme, maybe the reason for the late and limited (US only) release. Still Lego managed to design a lovely complete set, with good parts and great playing possibilities&nbsp;that was sold in a special packaging : a treasure chest shaped box. It is not hard to add the set to your collection if you collect the loose parts but the box is a must have for the true collector.</p>

<p><strong>Building 4 bricks</strong> : Building is fun to do also for young Lego fans. First you built a cave with a secret entrance where the treasure is hidden that you can slide out, on top of the cave you built a cannon on a turn table. In front of the cave a flounder with a corner turret attached to the rock as roof. For the pirate you built a small raft, the Islanders have the known red Canoe.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong> : All known great parts from the Islanders theme, several parts worth mentioning are the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=2345pb01"">panel with green pattern</a> and the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=6072"">corner turret</a>. The&nbsp;Pirate minifigures are ok and come with sufficient weapons and 2 flags&nbsp;but I love those Islander minifigures with shield and stickered canoe.&nbsp;An outstanding&nbsp;part (although not a brick) in this set is the special box.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong> : All is present for playing fun, 4 minifigures from opposite party&#39;s, a raft, a canoe and a hidden treasure on an Island. To complete playing fun even a crocodile.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks </strong>: Bricklink offers an <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=1788-1"">average price</a> of &euro;40,00 for a used set which is ok if it is complete with box, without I would recommend half this price. If you find it complete don&#39;t hesitate to buy it, it&#39;s very rare as you can see on Bricklink and will probably raise in value.</p>
