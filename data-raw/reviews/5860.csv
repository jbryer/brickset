To start off I must say that this kit is simply amazing; the level of detail on this model is staggering. This set is not for the casual builder, be prepared to spend 15+ hours putting this monster together. The box is about the same size as the Star Destroyer or Death Star with a shipping weight of 25lbs (11kg for my friends overseas) and an instruction manual that checks in at a whopping 300 pages. 

Like most other UCS models the build is broken in to several sections starting with the massive internal frame. There are some interesting techniques used in securing the frames ‘layers’ together as well as the use of different colors in the internal structure. Similar to the Star Destroyer the frame on the Falcon is very solid and heavy. I think this is also the first UCS model that doesn’t use a display stand (possible exception is the Blockade Runner); instead the ship sits on its 7 landing gear.  After the frame is finished the remainder of the build is basically building the front mandibles and then building the ‘skin’ sections and adding them to the model. Like the frame there are some interesting building techniques used, i.e. the way the upper and lower gun sections lock in to each other.  A major plus to the Falcon is the lack of ‘repeated’ steps, for me this kept the build moving forward and I never found myself getting bored.

The level of detail on the surface of the model is simply amazing. There is a nice mix of dark red, gray and black pieces that really help bring the Falcon to life. Since this model is minifig scale the designers have added some details to showcase the minifigs included with the kit. The top gun turret is removable so a minifig can be placed in the gunner’s seat. The cockpit seats four and the boarding ramp can be raised and lowered. The set includes 5 minifigs; Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, and Obi Wan. It also includes an extra smiley head (or at least my set did). 

For those who do not like stickers be aware that there are a few stickers to be applied in the cockpit. These stickers are rather small and are applied to one piece each. Thankfully the radar dish came with its sticker already applied. 

The only awkward section on the ship is the lower back section beneath the engine. This part seems warped when it is put on but after checking the instructions and the pictures on the Lego website I found that this is how it is supposed to look. This might be a good spot for a mod…

All in all this is an amazing model; yes it is expensive but at 5125 pieces it averages out to a price of about 10 cents per piece (USD).  I own all of the UCS models and can honestly say that this is easily my favorite Lego kit made to date; I am not sure if they will be able to top this one, but I guess we will see…

"Luigi78","2008-03-07T01:12:05.043Z","The price, if you can swing it, is absolutely justified","My review will mostly focus on the mechanical aspects of this massive set.  But first let me get this out of the way:

This set is absolutely stunning in just about every way.  There, I said it.  Time for some specifics...

Now, what really impresses me about this model is the fact that the ship itself is so accurately modeled.  It is truly remarkable how the Lego designers are able to create every odd angle and surface of this ship with parts that were originally intended for right angles only.  From the center of the ship, every body panel has a perfectly gentle slope downward toward the outer edge.

Regarding symmetry, this ship has NONE of that!  There is almost nothing on this ship that you find having to built twice (a big problem with the UCS Star Destroyer) because every piece of the ship is unique.  This is due primarily to the asymmetry of the ship (having the cockpit on the starboard side) and also because of Han and Chewie's extensive modifications to the Falcon.  Every panel is peppered with single stud details in all sorts of different configurations (and colors), making each panel assembly completely different and a true joy.  This thing really looks beat up, rebuilt, and modded just like it should.

The internal technic frame is extremely strong and durable.  I think Lego learned a lesson with the UCS Star Destroyer, which was a bit wobbly and tended to sag over time.  Even though I've only had this for a few months, I don't see that being an issue because of the strength I mentioned, but also because the weight is dispersed very evenly with the 7 sets of landing gear spread across the bottom of the model.

Speaking of the bottom, there were no shortcuts taken here, almost all of the detail you see on top is replicated underneath.  I often find myself telling people to stoop down and check out the bottom.

This ship is heavy, heavy, heavy.  Despite this, it's still quite easy to move around (provided you have the strength and long enough arms).  I suppose you could try to pick it up from underneath, but I find it easier to pull out the top center disc (this is intended, as it only sits on top with alignment pins and stays there due to gravity) and grab the internal frame.  This access point lets you carry the ship at its center of gravity with one hand.

CONS:
Now that I've sung my praises, time for me to list the negatives, but there's only one, and it's not too big a deal, but disappointing none the less.
Many of the top body panels are very loosely attached.  Some will have a single technic axle that sticks straight down and slides through a hole in a technic beam.  This provides a loose connection to the frame, and the rest of the body panel just rests on top of the frame with that single point of contact to keep it in place.  This means the panels can rotate a little around that single point, the only thing keeping this from happening is the fact that there are other body panels on either side keeping it in place.  It's like putting a puzzle together with all square pieces.  The parts don't really hold each other together and a bump can shift them around a bit.
For just about everyone, this 'problem' is not a problem at all, as long as the ship is sitting flat as it was designed to do, then gravity does its job and everything holds together just fine, really.  However, in anticipation of getting this set, I always envisioned mounting it flat on my living room wall, top side facing straight out.  As you can imagine, the top body panels would fall right off if you stood the ship on end.  I was quite disappointed when I first realized this.
I've since modded the design of the ship and more securely attached the top pieces. This has allowed me to do what I originally intended.  If you want to see what this thing looks like on a livingroom wall, check out my brickshelf folder here:

"sudorum","2008-02-24T20:00:23.06Z","THE SUPERGIANT OF ALL SUPERGIANTS","This lego is as big as lego sets come. Probably the most impressive Star Wars set too. It includes 5 minifigures, two of them being an updated Luke Skywalker and Obi-wan. The top layer of the Falcon is a series of flaps and panels that can be removed with a tad bit of difficulty. The top gun turret can raise to reveal Luke at the controls and the cockpit opens to reveal the four other passengers at the controls. The boarding ramp can also be lowered and the satellite turned. It is possible to put details and items in the inside of the Falcon, but once again a tad bit difficult, and not really necessary. I received this set as a present for christmas 07, and it took me nearly fifteen hours to build. Definitely time consuming. And, if you were one of the lucky few to buy this set early, a certificate is included that specifies the number of customer you were to buy the Falcon. A masterpiece, any lego collecter must buy it!

What I found the most frustrating looking for the parts.

I have just finished the 7744 &quot;City Police Value Pack&quot; for my son. I found that more fun to build becouse of the use of numbered bags for each step.

Why could not Lego do the same for such large model.

Peter M",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MetalAV8C","2009-05-22T19:48:39.42Z","“Here's where the fun begins!”","This is a remarkable set as others have described with great enthusiasm.  And yes, it is large and requires a considerable amount of space to build/display.  And yes, it is frustrating with the sheer number of pieces and bags to find what you need quickly unless you begin by sorting and organizing each piece from the start.  However, this is part of the challenge and fun of building such a hefty assembly.

I’ve read some complaints regarding the lack of space inside the ship, nevertheless, my son and I enjoyed utilizing pieces from the 4504 set and others to decorate the interior and enhance the exterior.  Based on a YT-1300 freighter image, we built the engineering bay with hyperdrive, cargo area, crew quarters, life support, and main hold. Personally, Lego is about being creative and making it your own so this was the most enjoyable part. There isn’t a lot of room to “play” with mini-figs, but it is impressive just to look at and show off. 
 
In regards to displaying it, I took Luigi’s idea of wall mounting it one step further. I wanted the option of displaying the ship oriented sideways or straight up and take it off the wall quickly if desired. I also wanted the appearance that the ship was floating on the wall without gluing it together so my son and I could still modify it. I had no idea when we began, how we would safely accomplish this. As Han Solo said, “I’ve got a bad feeling about this.”

After a little experimentation, I mounted the ship using only 4 bolts to a small piece of plywood. This required drilling four small holes into the hull of the ship. I used a minimum amount of glue in the hull section to strengthen and counteract the sheer force associated with the four bolts. I placed eye-bolts (equally spaced) on the top and the side of the plywood base. Using the same spacing, I mounted two modified hooks in my den wall (which I had to reinforce due to the weight of the ship). I can now quickly lift the ship onto the hooks and orient it straight up or to the side.

Because the top panels use gravity to keep them in place, I did use some strategically located thin pieces of double sided tape to hold the panels. I also glued the legs to the underside of the hull for rigidity.  I’m still paranoid that one day I’ll come home and find over 5,000 pieces all over the floor but so far (over 6 months), the ship has remained in tact hanging on the wall.

If you love Lego and Star Wars, have the space for it, and you can afford it, get one.  Don’t be afraid to make it yours and find a creative way to display it. Like Han says, “She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself.” Check out the photos:

When I did, I realised I was in for challenge (getting it from the front door to the back room, due to the weight. 50+ bags plus a large instruction book (multiple books may have helped as the weight has since caused pages to nearly fall out.) Sorting the bricks out is the biggest obstacle - especially the smaller bricks. 
Construction is fairly straight forward otherwise, with less symmetry than the ISD. The only area which I find difficult are the panels which fit to the front of the ship (with the large holes in, built with bridge parts) which are fragile and break as you try to fit them.

Pros:

Huge set - plenty of hours required (4 days first time)
Loads of external detail
5 figures
Weight distribution makes easier to pick up than ISD
labels on individual pieces allow for untroubled rebuilding

Cons:

Space consuming - especially when building
No internal features apart from 1 gunner station and cockpit
No droids
If this is an Episode IV set, why has Han got brown trousers and not blue?

"Caldlow","2010-02-25T12:37:17.873Z","To all people complaining about lose parts (and an appropriate review off course)","First off, let's get something straight: this set is not for playing, but for building! All these people saying there is no internal detail and stuff; that's because this is a collectors item, and you are only supposed to teke away parts to see how it looks like on the inside.
And alle those people saying you can't turn it upside down because there are so many loose parts; that's because it is not supposed to be turned upside-down. Again, those parts are to be reoved only when you want to look at the internal structure of the building!

Well, that's enough fighting for this review, let's get to the set.

Starting off with the box; well, let's just say it's big. And with that I mean really big. But that is no big surprise if you want it to contain over 5000 LEGO pieces and an instruction booklet of over 300 pages. Opening the box, and sorting the pieces out is an adventure itself, that will take you about 3 1/2 hours (in my case it took that long, maybe it's diffrent when you are taking the job). 5000 pieces is a lot, so we had the whole living room fillid up with LEGO pieces.

BUILDING:

Building this thing is just great. First, there's the framework - all LEGO technic, for you guys who love that - that will take you a long time to assemble. After that, it's just covering the whole thing. Beginning with the back, underneath the whole structure, and then working your way forward. Same thing up top, but then you start at the front, and work backwards. Overall, building took me about 8 hours (all one day).

PLAYABILITY:

Going to say it again. This thing is not for playing, but for building.

PROS:

Very, very large set;
Great detail;
Very sturdy frame to build on;
What else to say?

CONS:

Fragile covering, but if you handle it with care, no problems will occur;

OVERALL:

Very, very nice set, but only or collectors. 
Do not buy this if you intend to play with it.",FALSE,5,4,5,3,5

"Pianoman6988","2010-12-15T15:23:35.347Z","A kit well worth acquiring (if you can find one you can afford)...","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll start off by repeating what others have said about this kit. That being, that it IS NOT a toy to be played with, but rather it is a collector's set that is designed for display purposes. Now, onto the stuff that everyone really wants to know...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I became aware of this kit in mid-2009 but, like many other LEGO fanatics, balked at the original&nbsp;$500 price tag and put off picking one up until it was too late (i.e. no longer in production). I finally broke down and purchased one&nbsp;through eBay in late-2010 for almost double the original price tag (which is the only way that you can get them anymore, unfortunately). And, it was used (i.e. assembled once by the original owner) rather than brand new in a factory-sealed box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as a ""sticker shock"" warning to anyone who is considering picking up&nbsp;one of these collector's items up for themselves now that they are out of production, eBay and Amazon are the best (and just about the only) places to find one. Be prepared to pay between $1,000 (£645)&nbsp;and $1,300 (£835)&nbsp;for a ""used"" kit in good condition, and to pay $1,500 (£965)&nbsp;or more for a ""new"" kit still in the factory-sealed box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was fortunate with the one that I eventually acquired, however. This particular kit was made in a limited run of only 20,000 units, with the first 5,000 being released as a special&nbsp;""Collector's Edition"" that came with a numbered and signed ""Certificate of Authenticity"" from LEGO. My kit is #1,934 in this first-run series, which adds value to it even though it is considered ""used"". But enough history, on to the assembly...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Factory-packed LEGO kits are packed in something resembling a strategic fashion, meaning that the parts are packed generally into similar groups or types&nbsp;that will facilitate easier assembly. However, since my particular kit was used, the parts were simply packaged by the original owner in the order in which he removed them from the model. This resulted in my spending approximately 8 hours just sorting parts before I could even being assembly. Once I started assembly, it took me approximately 21 hours in total&nbsp;(working on and off, when I had spare time) to complete the model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I will offer several piece of advice that I'm sure others who have assembled this model will agree with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, make sure that you have plenty of space to work in a location that will be relatively undisturbed until you're done. This is a very large kit with almost 5,200 pieces, and it is not something that can be moved around easily once you start working on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, as the assembly progresses, it is necessary to turn the model over and work on the undercarriage. This is a bit problematic in that there are several attachment points for top-side assemblies that stick up above the frame that could be damaged by supporting the full weight of the model. Plan ahead and get help if you need it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, repeating what I said at the beginning of this review, the finished model IS NOT a toy and is not designed to be played with. Not only is it fairly heavy when completed (almost 17 pounds [8 kg]), but there really are no good places to hold onto it that won't cause damage or cause it to break because of how the exterior cover assemblies are attached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, I am extremely satisfied in my decision to acquire this collector's item. It is investment in both time and money that I don't regret for a second. I would highly recommend this kit to anyone who is interested in acquiring one. Personally, I found&nbsp;searching for&nbsp;it almost as much fun as putting it together.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,1,4
