As we all know with the discovery of the Internet, our world has become a smaller place.  With this in mind, The Lego Company has integrated the concept of Lego building and sharing into its newly formed Lego Factory collective.  Inside this program, any builder can download and upload their ideas for everyone and this model alone has generated more than 20+ alternative instructions.

In addition, the instructions really do promote advanced building techniques such as SNOT or SNIR methods using unique pieces and connection.  As complex as it might seem, this is still a great set for an average builder or someone who seeks a solid introduction into Lego trains.  Just remember that this kit does not come with a train motor or any railroad tracks, one must purchase those separately.  As of now, this set is only available on Lego shop-at-home of USA.

The question is not whether to buy one or not.  The dilemma is whether to buy two, three, or even five, so that one can make his or her own series of Lego train metroliners.  Personally I've purchased five and I have enjoyed every aspect of the designing process, especially when I build with my best friend, my dad, who is a retired civil engineer.

Thank you for taking your time to read over my review.  I hope that it has been informative.

I chose to build the double sided engine that James Mathis designed with the round slopes on the edges, and was amazed by the quality and strength of the Locomotive. With the remaining pieces, you could build another train car, but with your own creativity. Additionally, this set is great for a starter collection, only you need motors and track. It is a must buy at the clearance price of 49.99 USD!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It always bothered me to have so many spare parts left after building the crocodile engine. So I checked the parts and built a fairly simple passenger waggon and an even simpler freigt waggon. Apart from adding some small black plates (1x2, 2x2, 2x3) I only used the spare parts! Of course, I could've built more complex things, but I didn't want to disassemble the crocodile engine, which really looks great. But I changed it a bit. I added some small plates that were not in the set to its running gear to make everything more sturdy.

Looking at the box you must simply be gasping out of excitement when you see how many different models you can build with the parts in it. Use your imagination to create models which are not on the box! With all those parts you get it's not difficult!

This set comes without a motor, railway tracks and a speed regulator. In my opinion, LEGO should have included a motor 10153. Anyway, it's a fantastic set that I want to recommend to people who have been LEGO train lovers for a long time AND newbies to this theme!

Today I got my hands on my 2nd Hobby train set (10183) and just love this set. I think that together with the Holiday Train set it is the best train set ever!! I have the crocodile locomotive on display next to the Emerald Night,it is just great!

Pros;
- vast amount of very interesting train parts
- good color selection
- many models that can be customized easely
- lots of inspiration for own creations
- for 9v trains
- European locomotive designs

cons;
- availablility
- online instructions for other models, I hate building with a laptop
- Glued box, I miss a box with an insert on this set hat can be closed again


If you can get your hands on it, buy it!

instructions for 30 models, this box is guaranteed to deliver fun for
a long time.

We just built the main model plus a large box car, that used up perhaps
3/4 of the pieces including all the wheels. I'm looking forward to
build the other models as well, because I'm very curious to learn some
of the clever building tricks of the many designers behind this box.

Only &quot;problem&quot; is, the train we just built looks so good we do not
yet want to take it apart.  But I'm still curious about all
the models. To solve this problem, I ordered a second box. I figured
that with the excellent price/part of this box, 1080 pieces for $49.99
you can never go wrong with ordering a second box anyway. That way
we can keep building the next ones without taking apart whichever train
we like best.

I don't know of any other lego box that has such a good price/part
ratio. But the best part about the hobby train has to be the 30 models!
Usually we build our own designs, but it's also definitely nice to
build from instructions and get something we wouldn't have though of.
That's why I think the instructions add a great deal of value to
this box.  Lego should do the same with other boxes as well, add
free additional instructions online for other models you can make
with the pieces in the that box.  All that the lego company has
to do is to ask lego fans to build the nicest models they can make
out of the pieces in that box, and then put the instructions on
the web.


The reason to buy a lego instead of other toys is so that you can
rebuild your toy into something else.  In that sense, having 30
models makes the hobby train is the most &quot;lego-like&quot; of any lego box.
