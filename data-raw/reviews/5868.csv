"aaron","2007-03-20T20:03:16.793Z","A must have, worth every penny !","Overall Value: 5 (cost+aesthetics+features+build)/4: This set was a change of pace for me, as I wait for the 07 Technic releases (yawn, come on Lego! is that the best you’ve got, yes, the Bulldozer and Ferrari look interesting), sorry back to the review for Cafe Corner, this set was awesome and a lot of fun to build.
_________
Cost: 5 : This set a great value, $0.06 per element ($140.00 US / 2056 elements) Expensive ticket price but worth the cost for the style and shear quantity of elements

Aesthetics: 5 :  Outstanding, caf&#233; tables, working doors and windows, awing details, tile work, great brick work! Hats off Lego, It is about time a set of this caliber gets released. 

Elements: Very good mix of useful parts in this set, not every thing is the largest possible part, For example this set will use 3, 1x2 bricks instead of 1, 1x6 brick to detail a wall component. This gives the set much more flexibility in building other creations.

Features / Details: 5 : This hyper-detailed set 

The first phase is the construction is the base layer, which contains 2 rooms, one that houses the staircase to the hotel, and second is the caf&#233;, the interiors are not detailed, (fun stuff to build on another day). There are 3 working doors, a park bench, awing,  and 2 caf&#233; tables 

The second phase is the mid layer of the hotel, this houses the staircase to the third level, the interior space is not detailed with the exception of the staircase railing, and the interesting color striping on the walls. 

The third phase is the top layer and roof, this section contains a lot of details, there are “frog” gargoyles in each window, the slope tiling pattern of the roof, and the bell tower add to the appeal. The interior, like the second level, is not detailed with the exception of the staircase railing

The three layers also easily come apart to maximize the playability

Build: 5: This is a fun build there are some very clever details and great uses of elements.  In addition there are some great future opportunities to modify this set to your liking. Bottom line, you really can not go wrong with this one. A great addition to your collection.

"pfccypret","2007-05-21T04:03:40.01Z","Amazing set","I bought this at the Lego store at the Mall of America. The set was around $140 and the box says it has 2056 pieces, although I think I ended up with a few extra. It is amazing the amount of pieces this thing has and the time it takes to put together.

I think it is a beautiful design that really stands out. Lego has been hitting some homeruns lately, I hope they keep up the good work.

My only complaints are minor. There is a lack of detail to the inside of the building. However, since the entire set is so big, it's hard to get to the inside anyways without taking it apart. So that isn't a big deal. I would have liked a couple more mini-figs. Three just doesn't seem like enough for something like this.

For those feeling like this set isn't enough. They give you ideas for combining up to 6 of these sets resulting in truly massive cafe/hotels. I only have the one set, so I haven't tried them. But it looks like you just add middle sections to make it taller or just combine two complete sets to make it longer. I couldn't imagine spending $840 on 6 sets though.

All and all, this is something special and if you have the money, I 'd highly recommend picking one up.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cashcleaner","2007-03-22T08:27:22.98Z","It's big, but is it worth the cost?","With a lego kit as large as this, it certainly would be easy for anyone to get ahead of themselves.  Despite my usual instinct to rush through this model, however, I practised some restraint and worked a little slower than usual on it.

Make no mistake, this kit is MASSIVE, and the brick count is the highest I've ever seen (2056 pieces).  As a building goes, the overall design is very tight with some nice detailed touches here and there (the fan device over the corner entrance is a nice touch as are the sidewalk awnings).  Putting the set together wasn't too difficult, but with so many pieces, a lot of time was spent tracking down a particular brick.  The finished product displays very nicely and I really hope Lego does the right thing and make more buildings that can attach onto the sides of this kit. 

With all the good points out of the way, it must be noted that the kit does lack a few items.  Firstly, I'm a little disappointed that the bottom floor cafe has no interior elements included with the kit.  Surely Lego could have tossed in a counter top, coffee machine, and a few tables and chairs to complete the kit.  I understand not furnishing the top levels, but the cafe itself should have some interior elements.  Another issue is the large HOTEL sign.  Putting it together wasn't all that difficult, but there are a lot of irregular bricks involved in it's construction and a few annoying gaps exist because of it.

When all is said and done, this kit is incredibly detailed and impressive for its size and design.  It could do with a few more extras, but I'd say it's worth the hefty price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Mr_Hobbles","2007-09-01T19:07:37.927Z","The Perfect Set","Here's my short(ish) review of this set...

For starters, this is the set that brought me out of my Dark Ages.  I was reading Digg.com one day, and this was mentioned, and I just stared at the pictures of it for days, thinking to myself &quot;Man, this is the set I've wanted since I was a kid!&quot;.  I just couldn't resist buying it.

There isn't a single flaw with this set.  The three levels of the building are so different from each other yet totally complimentary.  Some of the building techniques I've never seen before, either.  From the ski-shoes making up the the fan at the front, to the bendy pole holding up the bricks in the archway.  Some of these are quite fiddly to get working, but once they're there that's them, and it looks fantastic.  They've even used a classic snot technique on the sign!

The whole modular building concept is brilliant.  I love the way this and 10190 Market Street look together.  The removable floors are awesome too, with even a complete staircase going from top to bottom.  The transparent sign adds a nice touch to the building too.  Also, if I'm not mistaken this is the first LEGO set with an actual sidewalk.

All-in-all, if you've got the money, you shouldn't be thinking twice about getting this set.  It's sure to go down as a classic in LEGO's history.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The amount of detail is simply astounding and is more the sort of thing you would see built on display at a lego store or legoland but you cannot actually buy. The only thing I would like to see is an interior add on pack to match up to 10185. I love the building technique used here building the 3 floors separately as it makes it very easy to move around and having the parts split into 3 sections making building more enjoyable as you tend to spend more time building rather than searching through a huge pile of bricks for that one tiny piece, there are also some interesting rare colours used in this set, If you are thinking of buying this then stop thinking and get buying as this set and the other ones in the series are truly legendary.

This set is what LEGO is all about - putting bricks together to create realistic-looking buildings with architectual detail.  These are the types of sets you often see at LEGO shows.

Other than the sidewalk, which is a little tedious to build, the building process is pretty fun.  Parts of the 2nd and 3rd floors are double-walled.  The inside walls are a different color inside than what you see outside.  

I love the fact that the designer used colors we don't often see, that I don't think I've seen before this set and Market Street came out, like light blue, dark blue, brown, tan, and dark red.  The walls are solid on all sides, reminiscent of older sets from the 70's, so there are no open backs.

"bmwlego","2008-06-17T16:35:23.31Z","Perfect!","Cafe Corner is the 1st set in the Modular Town design theme and I can't imagine it being any better than it is. Fine, there are no inside details but how often am I (or other AFOLs) going to play with this set. I built this set over a period of several hours over a course of 2 days and I love it. It has been on my computer desk with Market Street and a Modular MOC of my own ever since it was completed. I can't wait to add Green Grocer to my LEGO street. 
The pros are too numerous to mention without forgetting one. The color selection is gorgeous, navy blue, tan, brown, dark red and some medium blue thrown in for good measure. The minifigs included are perfect for this set. The red bicycle is a nice touch as is the word CAFE spelled in the sidewalk. The different styles of windows are  well designed, the skis to make the sunburst shape above the door on the corner are ingenious. The sloped architecture is not only realistic but pleasing to look at. The corner/angled design of the corner is a fine example of a LEGO designer using what is available in ways that most of us wouldn't think of using. The awnings are great. The HOTEL sign is a beautiful touch and the entire set is a thing of beauty.

It took me over the course of three days to build this set do to interruptions like school, chores, and bed times. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of furniture but I did design several times to try to get the perfect setup and I think I have found it now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First Floor</strong></p>
<p>The sidewalk was time-consuming but fun to build. i must admit it was the best part to build. I really liked the word 'cafe' spelled out in the sidewalk except it might not end up being perfectly straight. I am not sure why there are two baseplates and I also am not sure why they are green. That is one of the few downsides of this set. The use of a turntable for the corner effect was quite clever as well as the design for the 'HOTEL' sign. The use of skiis for the cafe sign was also interesting and looks nice. Another great detail is the silver grills for the sewer drain. The lights in front of the doorway to the cafe fall off somewhat&nbsp;easily after a while but it doesnt make much of a difference. The two tables outside are helpful on busy days at the cafe and the&nbsp;stools for them are quite cleverly&nbsp;made. The bench and lamp are a nice touch.&nbsp;The design on the wall separating the stairs from the cafe has a cool design on it.&nbsp;I furnished the cafe by flooring it with studded grey platforms. By the blue wall, there is a flat platform for a small dancefloor and a jukebox in the corner. next to the jukebox is a small table with two chairs. on the window between both doors is a table and two chairs. on the back wall farthest from the front door is a black and white checkered bar with two barstools and behind the bar is a shelf with drinks and coffee mugs&nbsp;and a cashiers desk with a cash register, key to the cafe, coffee machine, and a hook for the broom included. next to the desk is the trash can included. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second Floor</strong></p>
<p>The second floor is really nice but the floorboards arent very stable unless the builder takes a&nbsp;lot of time and effort when building this floor to keep them flat. I had a few issues with them after a while and had to take the floor off and fix it. The exterior is quite nice except the glass-less windows are kind of bizarre. The turntable part of this room was the hardest part for me to build. I like the interior colour. It&nbsp;and the black floor make it the darkest room in the building. The blue stripe in the red wall makes a nice contrast. The stair with a railing is about the only furniture and hardly counts as furniture so i had to add some. next to the stairs is a bin with three books in it.&nbsp;facing&nbsp;the wall that is the same side as the tables and stools outside, is a desk with a compass and a paper with odd writing on it. There is also a chair for the desk and a stool with a pet frog on it. In the secluded part of the room is a short bed (with a&nbsp;cat on it)&nbsp;with a trunk at the end and a nightstand&nbsp;(with a book tile and a drink on it)&nbsp;on the window-side.</p>

"TheLordWibble","2010-04-26T13:21:35.217Z","Cafe Corner - The original and almost the best!","<h4>Introduction</h4><p>Cafe Corner was the first of the modular building sets and also the first one I bought. It features 2056 pieces and three minifigures. The building includes many interesting building techniques and rare pieces. Although discontinued in 2009 to make way for fancier buildings such as the <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=10197-1"">Fire Brigade</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=10211-1"">Grand Emporium</a>, it is still a great set to buy if you can find it on eBay.<br></p><h4>Minifigures<br></h4>The three minifigures that come with the set all have the same (and typically Lego-esque) smiley face. Now, to be honest, I don't believe that this really is a bad point. It shows that Lego is returning to its roots. I get a bit bored of freckles and moustaches - I prefer the smiley faces as they have a sort of historic charm to them. And it also means that everyone at the Cafe Corner is happy. The first minifig is a girl with red trousers and a plain white torso. She also has quite long reddy-browny hair which extends below her face (I've never seen hair like this before). The next minifig has a tan blue torso with printing of a jacket on it; she also has white trousers and dark tan hair, which has a sort of crest in the middle. This minifig also comes with a red bike The third and final minifig has light bluish grey hair and trousers, and a black jacket with tie. He has a brown brush to sweep grapes (?) into a dark grey bin. <br><h4>Base<br></h4>At the base of the building, on top of a waffled green (?) baseplate is a pavement made with lots of 2x2 and 1x2 dark grey tiles, with light grey tiles at the edges to represent kerbs. On the left side of the building is a pretty mosaic upon which are situated two tables and chairs with parasols. Directly in front of the door is another mosaic (although less stunning than the one in front of the entrance to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=10211-1"">Grand Emporium</a>) and to the right is a brown bench (constructed with two hinge bricks and brown tiles) and white lamppost with a clear minifig head to represent the light. It'd be really cool to have a yellow head to switch in to make the scene appear to be taking place at night, but Lego don't seem to think this is a good idea. Ah well.<br><h4>Ground Floor - Exterior</h4>The Ground Floor is the most modern of the three floors, with large windows, light and dark gray pillars (made with 1x2 bricks and 1x2 log bricks) with curved bases (made with 1x2x1 arch bricks) and two doors. The black door with lots of clear panels leads in to the (empty) main room, the light grey door with one clear panel leads to the stairs that take minifigs to the first floor. Things to note on this floor are the interesting pattern made by the white skis above the black door and light grey arches (the same used on the pillars) above the grey door, and the two yellow and white adjustable awnings . There is also what I can only assume is a fire exit (?) to the left of the ground floor. There are also two black and trans-yellow light fixtures either side of the black door. There is also the first 45 degree mounted section, which uses a turntable piece to mount a whole section at a completely different angle to what studs normally allow. But the undoubted highlight of this floor (and possibly the entire building) is the huge ""HOTEL"" sign (constructed using SNOT techniques (that's Studs Not On Top, for those who don't know)) which is connected to the ground floor via two white hinge plates. The HOTEL lettering is made from trans-red plates, so that light can shine through and make the sign appear luminated. I enjoyed every moment of this mini-build. Unfortunately, when viewed from the reverse side, the HOTEL appears backwards, but that's a minor blip for such a cool part in this set. <br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><h4>Ground Floor - Interior</h4>Hmm... Not much to say here. Like <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=10190-1"">Market Street</a>, Cafe Corner does not contain an interior. However, this increases the playability of this set as you search for combinations of furniture that fit in the space. I managed to turn it into a pizzeria with things like a grill, drinks machine and freezer. You can do it too! However, the wall that separates the main room and the stairs ascending to the first floor DOES have an interesting pattern on it. Speaking of the stairs, they are constructed simply of light grey 2x4 bricks and 2x2 and 2x1 blue bricks of various shades. The back wall is constructed of light grey bricks with a dark grey stripe made from bricks.<br><h4>First Floor - Exterior</h4>The First Floor looks a lot less modern than the Ground Floor. It features black lattice windows and white empty frames (?). There are also some 1x2 brown tiles, which bring a textured, historical feel to the building. On the top of this floor is an interesting pattern using 1x2 inverted slopes and what can only be described as 1x1 ""cheese slopes"". This leads to the second floor.<br><h4>First Floor - Interior</h4>Again, not much of interest here, apart from the brown banister which uses a 1x4 cell bar piece. The stairs this time are merely a single brown piece. The back walls are brown with a red stripe made from plates.<br><h4>Second Floor - Exterior</h4>The Second Floor is possibly my least favourite floor. It's probably because of the white windows which, I feel, don't fit in with the rest of the building. And wheel covers with frogs in them? Really, Lego, really... Otherwise quite an interesting floor, with dark red arches which add an interesting texture to the building. Towards the top is the base for the tower (see the next section) which is constructed with light tan bricks.<br><h4>Second Floor - Interior</h4>There are no stairs to the roof here, but there is another nice banister, which is another good touch. The back wall is made of light tan bricks.<br><h4>Roof and Tower</h4>The grey roof is quite bare, with only two chimneys. Only a small section of the roof comes off, which is a shame as this makes it hard to play with the second floor. There is also the quite brilliant tower, made from tan arches and dark grey ""wing"" plates. There are also some dark grey owls mounted on offset plates.<br><h4>Conclusion</h4>The Cafe Corner is an amazing set, but future sets such as the <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=10182-1"">Green Grocer</a> surpass it in terms of interior, a big feature upon which we know Cafe Corner skimped on.

"cameljockie","2009-07-30T17:50:59.75Z","Awesome exterior","This was thefirst of what has now become a line of succesful, exclusive, and large building sets of the lego range. 

The ornate classical european architecture is captured brilliantly, with some really innovative building techniques not seen before. The canopys for example are made using bricks instead of canvas, which actually suits the overall look. The use of minfig skis as a door decoration is brilliant.

The colour scheme is brilliant with some lovely Dark red, browns, tan and rare dark blue pieces. The pavement is ornate in places which although time consuming to place, they give the set that extra bit of realism not seen before.

Obviously a lot reasearch and design planning has gone into this. But Fundamentally the one thing this set lacks is an interior. Its all well and good having stair cases and banisters but there are no details to speak of; just empty space. No furniture, no beds no kitchens, no bathrooms nothing. 

The ground floor which youd imagine to be a cafe with a counter and till, does not exist. Lego has marketed this set as a collectors model, and for the price range, perhaps it explains the lack of interior design.

Having said all this the set is designed to you can add an interior yourself, which I have done with great success. Its just more expenisve doing it yourself, especially if you are trying to match the design scheme of this model.

The figures are a nice addition, as is the becnch and cafe tables. 

So heres the low down:

Pros:
-Beautifully well designed architecture
-Rare and interesting pieces.
-Really nice colours
-Realistic designs.
-Highly adaptable for MOC.

Cons:
-Really is just a display model rather than a typical playset
-No Interior

But really, there's no question of ever giving up, or of not going to the effort of building it again. This is the first lego set I've ever seen that comes close to being a work of art. The colours, the design, the imagination required to turn a bunch of snowshoes into a storefront display, all perfect.

Unfortunately I bought Green Grocer before this one, so I was already used to the idea that they could have interesting interiors as well. But I'm quite sure that if I had bought this one first I wouldn't be complaining about the bare interior.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I like the fact that it has empty floors, which means that I can create my own layouts with existing parts and fit it out just how i think it should be.
I would have prefered a few more minifigs, perhaps a waiter or chef for the cafe.
I highly recommend anybody with the cash to buy this kit as it will make a great addition to any collection and it fits in perfectly with my Market Street.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Parkseonyang","2009-04-04T06:09:25.81Z","Fantastic piece of lego art","I've just completed constructing the cafe corner this morning after purchasing the set on Thursday. I must say this is currently the largest Lego set I've ever built (because I'll be putting up the green grocer set soon!)
The external facade of the building is simply fabulous, with amazing details from the top floor right to the bottom. I find the grey frogs and parrots used on the roofs are kinda amusing though. 
Let me begin with the pros, not that I haven't begun... the process of building this whole thing is just enjoyable (taking me roughly 5 hours to complete over 3 days), if you are a true lego fanatic. There is an old 50s feeling this cafe corner provides which is amazing what lego bricks can create!
Here are some of the cons, I believe this is what other reviewers would agree as well, the ground floor inside the cafe is really bare, with just the green plate, so it's up to you to design the interior which is what allowed me to do. The 2nd and 3rd floors are bare as well, and I realised that this building lacks a toilet! haha. But that's a really small issue for me.
Despite the cons, I must say that this is really a great set that any lego lover has to get if cash isn't so much of a problem.
I can't help but constantly admire the cafe corner adorned with lovely details!

"darthdc","2009-09-03T12:47:46.967Z","Great exterior - no interior","Like other reviewers, I bought this set when I had already acquired the Green Grocer set. One thing that inspired me to get this set was the principle of a 45 degree corner on a building (how was it done?). Other than that, it was the general look of the building.

Ground Floor:

Exterior - nice detailing, especially with the two main doors (the archway over the hotel door is a really good feature). The word ""Cafe"" is written in tiles where the tables are, though the letter F is partly underneath the building.
I'm lost for why a door was put in the side of the building where the tables are. Not only is it a built up door but it poses a problem for those interested in decorating the interior. The HOTEL sign is well done, the E is cleverly made.

The interior is - well nothing at all. Even the green base plates are visible. Interior designers, heres the blank canvas you need.

First Floor:

The tallest of the two upper floors. Designed so that if you buy multiple sets, you can stack several of these floors together. Again, the exterior has all best features - nice brick work.
The interior is left to having a railing on the stairwell. the plates used for the flooring is black, the back walls are brown and the front walls: dark red. The colour scheme could have been better - it is too dark. 

Second Floor:

This floor is better in that the interior walls are generally lighter. the floor is still black however and the furnishing is left, once again, to a railing at the top of the stairs.

Pros

Nice exterior - great show piece
Takes a while to build - all day
Clever building techniques

Cons

No interiors
Bricks/Colour rationing - why are some colours restricted to certain bricks - the lower floor consists of 1x2 and 1x4 dark blue bricks - 1 layer is almost entirely 1x2 bricks
First floor is too dark

The lack of interior is the main con on this set and is why I give it 4/5. The saving grace being that the exterior is so good.

"Xiaolong","2010-03-10T16:18:13.793Z","Colour differences","This weekend (6-7/03/2010) I build this Cafe Corner. For almost everyone this is very exciting. For me it was a big disappointment. It looks great from far but is far from great. Lego used to be so good but the last few years quality is really disappeared.

The groundfloor has two white/yellow sunscreens. But the yellow of the 1 x 1 tiles is not the same as the yellow of the 1 x 2 tiles.

Also the brown bricks from the first floor and the tan bricks of the second floor come with differences. Even the dark-red plates vary.

In more than 30 years I have never seen differences in colours. A few years ago they lowered the quality of the plastic and now they even can’t keep their colours.

These differences come in different bricks but more frightening is that the eight dark-red Brick, Modified 1 x 2 x 1 1/3 with Curved Top come in two shades.

Did no one see this? Does no one care about this? Or do I have an absolute unique collectors piece?

What also annoys me is that the base plates are green instead of dark grey like Market Street. If you want to build your own interior, you have to tile it all as no Café has a green floor. It also gives an unrealistic insight in the sewage drain.

"kenhew","2011-06-24T08:54:54.487Z","An iconic masterpiece","<p>When I first got out of my dark ages, this set was already discontinued. I was 3 years late, and the only way for me to get this set was either through bricklink or ebay. Of course the price then was really inhibiting for me as I realized how much the prices of LEGO sets went up during my dark ages. Still, I bit the bullet, and paid US$300 for it. Now I'm so thankful to myself that I got it, if I haven't gotten it then, there's no way I can afford it with the prices that it is commanding now. I wondered how can it be so valuable and that people are still getting it. I can only justify that, apart from being a beautifully designed set, it is an icon by itself that this was the one that started it all, it kind of represent a paradigm shift in people's perception that LEGO is just a child's toy. With this set, you no longer see it as a toy, but a masterpiece of an artwork, which you would proudly display and admire. But, this set was more than just the sum of its parts, it featured new, articulated building techniques, giving aspiring AFOLs plentiful lessons how to go beyond with their LEGO. When people came to know I'm into LEGO they were like, what you still play with kids stuff and then I showed them this, the Cafe Corner, there wasn't anyone that didn't go...WOW</p><p><br/></p><p>So if you can afford it, get it.

"xboxtravis7992","2015-11-21T22:38:38.863Z","The Set that Started Me on the Path to Being an AFOL...","<p>The year was 2007. I was 13 years old then, and my Lego habits where about to shift BIG time. After buying several Bionicle sets at the start of the year, I soon was proclaimed I wasn&#39;t into Bionicle anymore after building those strange Barraki. &nbsp;Lego sets were starting to look basic, a little bland; and a tad boring; and the only thing I was still interested in were the Star Wars sets. In retrospect, this could have led to&nbsp;what Lego fans normally call, &quot;The Dark Ages&quot; &nbsp;However, before I lost faith in Lego; The Cafe Corner arrived on the scene, averting me from entering any sort of &quot;Dark Ages&quot; and renewing my excitement in Lego. This set marked my transition from KFOL to TFOL; and set me down the path to becoming an AFOL...</p>

<p>This is though, kind off a hard set for me to review. It has been well covered in AFOL press and fan sites. The Cafe Corner&#39;s building styles have been eclipsed by the Modular Buildings which have&nbsp;followed; which contain&nbsp;more detail and interior decorations. Since the Cafe Corner arrived; Lego has given us a plethora of sets aimed for their teenage and adult fans, all of which have built on the ideas first showcased in The Cafe Corner.</p>

<p>And what were those ideas here in The Cafe Corner? It was that Lego could sell an advanced highly detailed set, which rivaled the detail at even the Legoland park&#39;s Minilands. It was the idea that adults and teens would buy something big and expensive; without the Star Wars UCS label. It was the idea, that Lego could retain it&#39;s adult and teen fans through more complex sets.</p>

<p>As we all know Cafe Corner was a success in all of these regards. I myself was caught into its design, and as the years have progressed I have bought other large models; the Grand Emporium, the Town Hall, the Palace Cinema, the Haunted House, the Volkswagen Van, the Emerald Night, the Maersk Train, and the Horizon Express. Every&nbsp;single one of these sets, and their kin were what kept me glued to Lego throughout my teen years. Along the way I of course continued to buy Star Wars sets, and other licensed sets; but these big sets became a tradition, sort of a Lego Fan&#39;s right of passage. My family has accustomed&nbsp;to me building a large Lego set on Christmas morning as part of the family tradition, and when I returned from living two years in South America; one of the first things I did was build the Palace Cinema.</p>

<p>The Cafe Corner&nbsp;is a set which easily deserves 5 stars. I can&#39;t begin to explain just how well this set continues to integrate into my Lego collection, nearly 8 years since I first got it. Furthermore who would have believed in 2007 that all these years later, that the Modular Building series would have become a regular Lego release? This set is just simply put, awesome.</p>

"MrJackson","2016-07-27T16:25:11.6Z","Assembling an Innovator","<p>Hi everyone. This is actually my first Brickset review. I&#39;ve been gathering pieces for both Cafe Corner and Market Street for several months now and have finally been able to build both. Most, if not all of the reviews for CC are at least several years old at this point, with newer modulars at better price points containing more modern building techniques available. Since many purchasers of new modulars find the older few to be way out of budget, I will attempt to answer the questions of does it still have its luster,&nbsp;is it worth getting, and what is the best way to go about that.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>So, I used Bricklink, Pick a Brick, and Bricks and Pieces to fill out the remaining inventory that I did not already have. Back before the holidays I printed out the parts list to this and 10190 Market Street. After going through my loose parts inventory and having about 70 percent of each set, I decided it was worth it to finish them. Needless to say, I don&#39;t have a box to reference or comment on.</p>

<p>The instructions are available free in PDF form. I wouldn&#39;t recommend printing them unless you hate trees: there are a lot of pages and you&#39;ll kill your ink supply.&nbsp;HOWEVER, they are EXTREMELY difficult to make out in terms of both color, and especially when trying to tell&nbsp;where one brick ends and the next begins. It can be very hard to make out, on several walls for example, what the order of the 1x8, 1x4, and 1x3 brick they use. I kind of had to guesstimate and just make sure they interlocked and overlapped. I would absolutely recommend taking advantage of the call-out boxes on each page with that step&#39;s pieces.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Phenomenal selection. Most of the once-rare parts, like the sloped bricks that make the roof, are more common now, thanks to Elves and a few in Pet Shop. I don&#39;t know if they are on Bricks and Pieces. Quite a few earth-blue bricks, including pillars that look fantastic, a rare light bley&nbsp;door, very rare light bley&nbsp;2x2 turntables,&nbsp;a good use of dark bley parrots and frogs as ornamentals, and that front door.....The white skis that make up the front sign are brilliantly executed, but unfortunately can&#39;t be swapped for the skis that don&#39;t have hinges. Unfortunately, the hingeless&nbsp;ones are the only ones available from Lego anymore. Excellent color blocking and contrast, and it&#39;s amazing to see what they did with more basic parts, as opposed to the use of newer pieces like the Nexo Knights shield in the Brick Bank or the brick-bricks that make up half of the second floor of Detective&#39;s Office. No olive green a-la Parisian Restaurant; just a great use of earth-tones that existed back in &#39;07. You will need quite a few reddish-brown bricks in various sizes, and many, many headlight bricks in dark red, reddish-brown, and tan. Which is good as they are three very versatile colors for other uses if you get them in bulk.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I did not go through the trouble of getting/assembling minifigures. The shop owner and customer with the plain white torso are around $5 USD, but the third, in the light blue coat, is around $30. Since Cafe Corner is simply going to go in the block of modulars in the midst of the fledgling 8&quot;x12&quot;&nbsp;layout I am working on, I didn&#39;t think it was a priority. I may get the shop owner down the road so it&#39;s not a totally empty building. If you have enough minifigures&nbsp;you could populate it with whomever; it is a cafe, after all, so there should be lots of patrons. You&#39;ll need to make an interior, however.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>LONG. Usually modular buildings take me about 3 to 4 hours, tops. This was more than double that. Which is good, since that&#39;s what you want and expect from a big, exclusive set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build begins with an earth-blue layer for which it was nigh impossible to tell the length of bricks for from the PDFs. The first floor is assembled with the stairs to the second level on the right. The brick with arch no. 2339 can be replaced with a color other than dark blue since you won&#39;t see it and the dark blue arches are kind of cost-prohibitive. The build moves to the sidewalk where &quot;CAFE&quot; is spelled out in the sidewalk stones to the left of the door. There are a number of 1x1 plates and tiles for this section, which can be a pain to line up well if you&#39;re a perfectionist as 1x1s have a bit of rotational give. The &quot;HOTEL&quot; sign is a good early example of lettering techniques: not in the sense of it being particularly innovative so much as eye-opening to future possibilities. We&#39;ll see better execution of the technique in Pet Shop and Al&#39;s Barber from Detective Office.</p>

<p>The second floor alternates between the windows, which are each a pair of 2362 panels, and the wall in between windows, which are headlight bricks with tiles on the front. The back of the building is fairly repetitive but not nearly as much as, say, 10224 Town Hall.</p>

<p>The third floor is the roof; if you&#39;ve built the Pet Shop the technique of one slope being a stud higher than its neighbor will be very familiar. Continues to the bell tower (no bell, though) and then the roof itself. The corner is canted 45* via those light gray turntable plates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are spots where you can cut corners when getting pieces that don&#39;t need to be absolutely identical to the original parts, but work totally fine and you won&#39;t tell the difference. I had mentioned the dark blue arches. The panels that make up the second floor windows have hollow studs in the original and the part&nbsp;4132 2x4x3&nbsp;Window for the third floor is manufactured with both solid and hollow studs. For each of these two pieces, just get the cheaper ones, as the originals style&nbsp;molds are expensive and irrelevant. They will both be covered anyway. The price differences will astound you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;I used the 73435 door with trans-clear glass in old light grey instead of light bluish gray. The difference in color actually isn&#39;t that noticeable; pretend it&#39;s weathered with age. The difference in price, however, is a couple dollars for old gray vs. $20 or more for new.</p>

<p>There are also pieces where, unfortunately, only the originals will do, so be prepared to pay. The 2x2 turntables will look garish in old gray and there aren&#39;t a lot of those on Bricklink to begin with. The light-bley versions&nbsp;average $20 USD to start. The black door can&#39;t be swapped either, and you&#39;ll need eleven of the correct type of skis for the front sign. This is where you&#39;ll spend the money on this set. I would order those on payday so you don&#39;t feel quite as guilty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Modern modulars definitely make more use of SNOT techniques as well as half-stud-offset techiques, typically used for windows. As stated in other reviews, there is no interior. Not much I can add to that other than get creative. There are some very very cool MODS that have interiors on all three floors added - they are well worth checking out.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very visually-heavy was the first thought that comes to mind. Parisian Restaurant (my all-time favorite set ever) looks downright dainty next to it. Come to think of it, all the newer modular buildings do. It has a heft to it, literally and figuratively, that doesn&#39;t seem to exist anymore as more effort goes toward interiors. It is an extremely imposing set that doesn&#39;t try to be too much at once - this was my main issue with Detective&#39;s Office. The floors are only held together with a single stud, as opposed to newer modulars, where the tiles are broken up by those 1x4 plates with the two studs on the end that provide more clutch. As a result, you need to be a little more careful moving it. It&#39;s tall, too. Several inches higher than the Bank. I&#39;m going to have to figure out the best way to order&nbsp;the eleven of them into a big city block.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>An incredible build, and very satisfying experience once the hunt for pieces was finally finished. I just built&nbsp;Palace Cinema a week or so ago (after it sitting in the attic over at my parents&#39; house for over a year) and I don&#39;t think the Cinema necessarily offered anything that Cafe Corner didn&#39;t. Well, maybe a price tag that is several orders of magnitude less.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest detriment to this set is the cost. The sealed versions are untouchable, and even built ones will set you back $500 to start. If you have enough of the pieces in your inventory to make it worthwhile, however, I would absolutely say to go for it. It may not be my absolute favorite building experience when it comes to modular buildings (that honor goes to the Parisian Restaurant, which has yet to be dethroned) but in terms of completed models, it is absolutely terrific. Pictures don&#39;t do it justice.&nbsp;</p>
