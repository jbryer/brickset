"knightsnap","2007-11-01T19:42:13.077Z","Cute little Set","This is a cute little set that goes well with the hospital theme for the new lego city. Coming from Australia, its great to have a little plane for sick people, since we have the great flying doctors service. The set is a little pricey ($20 @ Myers) but the plane actual design is pretty realistic. The actual design for placing the patient in the plane is a little dodgy, but the stretcher trolley is a nice addition as well (the wheels actually work). ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jpmanalo","2008-07-12T08:28:36.233Z","Well designed, great play value - get one if you can!","A great little set, if you can get your hands on it. Apparently, this set was produced for use as a promotional set by airlines, and as such wasn't readily available in retail stores. A limited amount was shipped out to two Australian retailers - K-Mart and Myer. Both retailers sold the set for AUD $19.99. 
 
The design is quite compact, so the patient stretcher doesn't neatly sit inside the aircraft (it does fit inside the aircraft). The stretcher is designed quite well, and is a lot bulkier than the &quot;standard&quot; minifig stretcher. 
 
Unlike other sets of this size, this set came with two instruction booklets - the main booklet containing the instructions for the model, and a small folded up sheet with images of other sets in the LEGO City series (very similar to those included in sets from the 1980's). 
 
A highly recommended set, if you can find one! 

I rate it four medical stars out of five...

Pros
Looks good
Patient goes in the back
Patient looks cool
Looks old fasioned with propellers on wings
Lights on wheels
Just looks awesome

Cons
NONE!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Tradeworld72","2009-01-13T11:51:05.733Z","Buy it!","I bought this set on the plane and it was a little expensive (Â£10) but its well worth it.
The overall design of the plane is good and the back hatch opens up is reaaly good. However, the stretcher cannot fully fit onto the plane.

Pros:

Nice design
2 minifigures
new stretcher!
great airport addition

Cons:
cockpit doesnt open
nowhere to store strecher body

I would definatly reccommend this set if you spot it in the magazine. Just don't build it on the plane in case theres turbulance and pieces end up 3 seats away from you.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Thomascity","2009-10-23T12:35:27.17Z","Incredible!!","This is my first review.

This plane is the best Lego plane ever. It's small, but really nice and realistic.
I bought it on Ebay for ca. 33.00$ included shipping. I know it was really expensive for such a small set, but all worth the money. 

Here is some Pros. and cons.:

Pros:
 - realistic
 - looks nice
 - two minifigs (doc and patient)
 - realistic hospital bed
 - fits into a city, even without a hospital

Cons:
 - very hard to open the cockpit
 - no room for the entire bed, only the stretcher
 - overturns easily

The main reason I bought it is that I have flown in an air ambulance.

Overall, a really good set. I recommend it to all Lego city collectors, like me.
I give it a 10/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
