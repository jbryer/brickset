"pythonkid","2005-07-19T23:37:43Z","My first set ever. ","This was the first set I ever got, and it spawned my obsession with legos. It brings back many memories whenever I hold it. When I first built it, it took many hours. I was glad to see it built though. Soon after this, I had to get more legos so I went and got the Deep sea predator. Yes, aquazone can be in space. I like how there are two gun like things that are in holding areas, along with a ton of slanted bricks. I also like how there is a back peice that can make the main ship be like a launcher for the smaller one. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-03-31T11:59:17.503Z","Universal Praise","There are only 4 Unitron sets - a land vehicle, a monorail, a base and this. The design is great with lots of slope pieces which may be unnecessary as far as the set goes, but instead adds to the illusion that this vehicle is a hawk with the wings outstretched to the front.  The tail is also a bit superfluous, but adds to the overall asthetics of the design.  The cockpit, which is detachable, fits on the monorail or on the land vehicle.  The bad news is that because it requires a hole and plug, none of the cockpits from the other set can fit on this.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Moscadini","2008-02-15T21:00:16.233Z","Awesome!","I want to say that this is by far most one of my favorite Space Sets of all times no matter what.  Yea, it has a lot of &quot;slope&quot; pieces...but it should be based on how it got anyways.  I enjoy the amount of engines it has and as well as the cannons.  I like the 2 &quot;secret&quot; cannons.  And how the cockpit comes off is cool as well.

This is a definitely must have ship...but not because it is from Unitron, but because it is slick and an awesome fighter",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"YeahYeahYouWere","2007-11-07T13:56:52.293Z","Funky But Fun","While I agree with some that this set was slightly...shall we say funky...I still loved it.  I can see how it might seem a little bit over the top to some people, but as I was still pretty young when this set came out, I was pretty amused by the over-the-top-fluorescent-transparency.   I particularly loved the yellowish-greenish pieces that really stood out.

I also really loved the way that the cockpit could detach from the rest of the model.  Of course this always led to a narrow escape by the pilot as he ejected the small cockpit just as the main cruiser crashed into the cliffs of the desolate planet he was exploring!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-29T22:15:38.64Z","Probably the only unitron veichle that blows spyrius out the water","Since this was one of the only unitron ships, it is also their largest. I think the wing shape looks very futuristic and nicely shaped. This ship is intimidating and poses as the big threat to unitron's enemies, spyrius. It also includes some weapons and the unitron cheif, a great minifig.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-20T15:33:02.84Z","An amazing spaceship, yet lost to the sands of time","This ship is just WOW! The ship is both visually and physically spectacular. Plenty of playability espacially with the two tools on the wings, which can be a camera, blaster, scope, or whatever you choose! With more than enough detail and a positionable fin that can be used for vertical (instead of the standard horizontal) landing. My only gripes are: that the structure is unsound when being built and often falls apart until the larger parts are added; the cockpit is not airtight, the second passenger has no seat unles you move the pilot farther aup and put the two in a tandum sled posture; the detachable cockpit, though cool, isn't sturdy on the main unit, it wobbles unless you put a plate and tile on the bottom (which could easily be arranged); and that the tool used by the other minifigure has nowhere to go, a small clip on the underwing would have sufficed. Otherwise great!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ra226","2012-04-19T20:53:30.187Z","Strange bird--just not quite right, but some good parts.","<p>Ah, Unitron, the ""Forgotten"" space theme. &nbsp;The entire Unitron theme consists of only 4 sets: two bases, a rather odd ground vehicle, and this, the mixed bag that is the Star Hawk II. &nbsp;I recently acquired one of these and I'm trying to decide whether to keep it or not...</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Interesting form, some fun functionality</li><li>Two minifigs and detachable front section offer good playability</li><li>Lots of good pieces--easy to make something better with only these parts</li><li>When viewed at proper angle, it looks pretty cool</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>When viewed at any other angle, its highly blocky design becomes evident--it's not nearly as sleek or elegant as the box art makes it out to be</li><li>Color scheme is too busy (uses 3 primaries and 2 hilights compared to previous themes which used 2 primaries and 1 or 2 hilights)</li><li>Uses large bricks where smaller, more detailed elements could have gone</li></ul>
<p>I just don't know what to make of the Star Hawk II. &nbsp;It's a great concept, but the execution just isn't quite there. &nbsp;Is it trying to be a sleek fighter? &nbsp;A scientific exploration vehicle? &nbsp;A stealth recon vessel? &nbsp;...It's too bad, because I can see past the flaws and almost grasp what the designers were going for, but the actual result falls short. &nbsp;You have an interesting form, but too many parts and colors weighing it down making it look blocky.</p><div>To begin with, as I was assembling it, it actually looked best about two thirds of the way through construction--before the engines on the bottom and some of the slopes were added. &nbsp;Once complete, it's too tall and bulky. &nbsp;There are bricks and slopes where there should have been plates and tiles. &nbsp;To get an idea of what this set <i>could</i>&nbsp;have been, check out the 2007 Mars Mission sets. &nbsp;The alien ships in&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7693-1"">7693</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7690-1"">7690</a>, for instance, have the same general Cylon Raider-like form as the Star Hawk but actually look cool (despite the use of those large saucer-hull pieces).</div><div><br></div><div>Another major minus is the color scheme. &nbsp;It doesn't look awful, but Unitron was the first theme since classic space to use more than 3 colors and a hilight. &nbsp;Prior to it, most themes used only two primary colors and one or two hilight colors. &nbsp;For instance, Ice Planet (from just the previous year) used mainly blue and white, with orange glass and a few touches of black. &nbsp;Blacktron I: mainly black and yellow, with yellow glass and trans-red hilights. &nbsp;Unitron, on the other hand, uses blue, gray, and black equally, most glass is trans blue, minifigs are yellow, and hilights are neon yellow. &nbsp;It's just too busy.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite those issues, you do get a lot of good pieces--I'm sure many good alternates are possible using only the pieces in the set. &nbsp;And perhaps more important, the Star Hawk II itself can probably be improved greatly by simply removing/relocating several parts. &nbsp;A Star Hawk III, perhaps?</div><div><div><br></div><div>So in the end, it earns a 3/5. &nbsp;I'm planning on keeping it but redesigning it. &nbsp;Perhaps in an attempt to make it into what it was meant to be.</div></div><p></p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,3
