"Gus_263","2008-04-10T14:55:14.373Z","An useful small promotional set","This is another promotional set, another small from the Bionicle theme. The set have a good color scheme, basically black with silver weapons. The building involved is simple, but more nice made for a small than some other small bionicle promotional sets. The feet are black, in the shape of the bohrok's feet. The legs aren't much good in playability, are in the same shape of the vahki's arms, but it still in a good place for the set.  The body is connected by a zamor sphere launcher, that launchs very well, and is increased with two mantax's little blades. The head is a black foot, the same used in the inika nuparu. It still good, because the eyes are simple builted, but also cool. To increase the playability, is a tail, that have another blade on it, and makes all the set still in feet. This is an useful promotional bionicle set, and the playability is simple, but better than some other promotional sets. Good for the size, and to increase other bionicle sets. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It was because the original pieces were lost, So I used pieces from other sets to see classic loose pieces. It is like new, but not bad and I also downloaded instructions for this set to see how to view it. Note that in some day, I will send a image of Bad Guy 07 and you will have viewed this file only lots found on 'Brickset' and other infinite lego databases on Internet Explorer.</p>",TRUE,1,3,2,4,5
