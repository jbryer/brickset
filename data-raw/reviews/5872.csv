"Johan_van_den_Heuvel","2007-05-26T17:22:24.82Z","Let the tournament begin!","While visiting a new store i noticed they had some of the new lego sets! :)
So i decided to take some home. Including this one, for just 7,95 EURO, 11 USD. It brings back some nice memories i have of set 6021. Ahh the good old days... :)
Well lets go to the pros and cons:

pros: 
-late 90s style knight! :D
-Black &quot;skelleton&quot; knight! real cool design!
-a white horse
-a black skelleton horse
-cool new weapons
-potential army building set

cons:
-not much to build.. but well, to be honoust, i dont really care.. ;)

Conclusion:

Overall its a good set. Personnaly i really like the skelleton army. It is a real cool novelty of the lego designers. Although i like the late 90s style knight even better! The knight has silver touches on the helmet! If you like knights, buy buy buy!!! At 7,95 EURO it is a real bargain. You get a real cool set. :) ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Deinonychus","2007-06-27T20:08:39.98Z","Joust about right.","The Final Joust is just one of the handful of smaller sets in the new Castle theme that pits heroic Knights against an evil Skeleton Army. You've really got to think about what kind of plot developments would bring the Lead General into an honorable joust with the Black Knight Skeleton, but that aside, you really can't go wrong with a good LEGO jousting set.

The set is pretty much just what it looks like with no surprises. 62 pieces shake out to give you a jousting rail, weapons rack, weapons, and two mounted opponents for $8-$10 US. The pieces making up the rail and rack are, for the most part, basic bricks and plates and look as if they are the property of the Knights due to the blue and gold detailing and flags. The weapons in this set are plentiful. you get two lances, two shields, a basic sword, a scythe sword, an axe, and a flail, so once the lances &quot;break&quot; on the first pass, the combatants can switch to other instruments of pain.

The combatants are the centerpieces of the set and rightly so. The Lead General has printed chest armor and a helmet with a flip-up visor molded in silver. His horse has a golden headpiece and printed livery. When fully decked out with shield, sword, and lance this is a very cool knight. The Black Knight Skeleton, apparent leader of the undead army, is perched upon a black skeletal single-piece horse . His T-visored helmet covers a face with eerie red eyes, and the printed chest armor has a very cool ribcage-like pattern of metal plates decorating it. He has got to be one of the more impressive of the &quot;full-bodied skeletons&quot; in the theme. 

There's really not a whole heck of a lot you could build out of the pieces aside from what it is sold as. But when you get down to it, this set is nothing more then an excuse to pack a mounted Knight and mounted Skeleton Warrior together...which is a good thing by almost any calculation. 

This set is just barely, if not slightly short of being worth the price tag, but it is fun nonetheless and a must-have for any fan of the new Castle theme.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Nased","2007-10-19T05:45:38.967Z","Great Duel","I would give this little set a 10/10.

Reason 1: It cost me just $12SGD for a 62 pieces set and I get quite a lot of goodies.

Reason 2: The weapons include 1 grey lance, 1 short sword, 1 axe and 1 big crown shield for the Crown Knight. The evil black skeleton knight has 1 black lance, 1 flail, 1 awesome scythe and 1 big skeleton shield. The helmets and armour are unique to the good and evil forces.

Reason 3: I get 2 great mini figures and 2 horses(1 normal white horse and 1 black skeleton horse. There's a rack for the additional weapons and a barrier thingy to spice up the scene of the final joust.

Reason 4: These 2 figures are Knights and they can act as the generals/commanders to the crown knights and skeleton army. Great!

In conclusion, I have gotten one set and I think it is good to have at least one of this set. It's up to personal preference if you would like to get more. I like this set a lot and I would really give it a perfect 10.

"Gus_263","2008-04-05T15:57:13.59Z","The final joust","This set is small in comparison with some other castle sets with joust (some lassic castle sets were more small than this but some other were bigger), but still cool, altough have no much new thigs and also not much classic castle sets characteristics. The set includes two minifigures, on, with the same face of the Rascus (one of the 2004-2005 knights kingdom theme) and same design, printed details and armors of other knights of the current castle theme, but this is useful and stay cool. The skeleton minifigure is the most complete of the skeleton minifigures, due to the armors and helmet, that stay good in it. The skeleton is the same in designs like others, too in the head, but this design still nice. The two horses are different, one is a black skeleton of a horse and the other is a white horse with gold and blue coloured armors. The weapons include are useful, like the flail, axe, the two different styles of swords, shields and the joust spears. The few building included is on the little wall that the weapons stay guarded, and it is made with some blocks in the gray, blue and some gold colors, that are increased with two little flags, but this small wall don't still in feet sometimes. The joust can be played with the rail, made with some blocks like the small in bridge shape, with gray color, increased with other blocks with few brown color, some blue and gold increased. The rail is good builted for a little, but it don't stay in feet so much. Overall, altough the building is not the best for a joust, this nicely designed small is a cheap option to get a small castle set, much better than the impulse.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lego12","2008-04-24T19:49:41.42Z"," This set has SO many RARE pieces!"," This set is so cool and it has so many pros:) and so little cons:( that i'll give you the list.....

 Pros:

1. The knight mask is really rare and cool!

2. The knight's and the Skeleton's armour is really unique and the first of its kind that I have seen.

3. The weapons are really cool and you get a lot of them.

4. The horses are so cool that it is the reason I couldn't resist this set!

Cons:

1. The weapons rack tips over if not on a solid surface.

3. It is hard to place the Lance, or the long things to knock each off their horses, on the minifiures hands because the horse is blocking the posbility to do so.

That is the only problems with this set which are not a lot. So thanks for reading this and have good day!

"the_brickster","2008-04-26T02:58:47.293Z","Cool- but too expensive","well, the set has a few things and everything is decorated though theres not much to decorate. I got this for $10 and over all the sets cool but waaayy overpriced.
Pros:
-cool knight with cool armour.
-cool skeleton with ribcag-ish armour and &quot;battle worn&quot; shield
-lots of weapons  
-jousting thingy that stops the knights from getting of their horses and starting a punch-up
Cons:
- overpriced
- skeleton wears a sweater(a present from the evil wisard, perhaps? or maybe he's too modest to show his bare ribcage.)
- knights head is fat when you look from the front-i mean it.
- no trophy
- nothing else so it looks bare- i fixed this by adding a gateway that looks like a castle, a spectators bench with food, some guy with a video camera on a cherry picker and with some more horses.

A nice assortment of accessories accompany two mounted knight figures, always a plus.

"JohnnyB87","2008-09-14T20:25:18.107Z","A well rounded set","While it may not include an abundance of pieces, the pieces it does include are quite useful. I suppose I'll start off with the two minifigs and two horses as they are likely to be the main attraction. 

The knight is very well suited for battle, including a visor helm and detailed Crown breastplate. The visor can indeed hold plume, which is great for customization. The white horse he is riding is definitely ready for some rough times ahead. He has a pearl gold armored helm paired with a highly detailed barding that I have only seen in this set (blue/gold color combination). Like the LEGO horses of the past, this horse's head/neck moves up and down.

The skeleton has the torso and legs of a normal minifig and both pieces are purely black with a red belt. He comes with an older style black helm and a black breastplate with an armored ribcage print. He has white hands and a white head. Dressed almost all in black does make him seem quite evil. His horse is black as well with no points of articulation due to cost constraints. Overall, a very imposing opponent. A sidenote, my skeleton's arms are black and not red as displayed on Brickset's picture.

Each minifig has a wide selection of accessories to equip, including but may not be limited to: a full Crown shield, a full skeletal shield, a flail, a sword, a poleaxe, a jousting stick/pike for each minifig, and a skeletal sword that can transform into a scythe due to its handle grips.

The jousting fence is very simple but does its job as a divider. The good thing is, many of the parts are good for building up a castle or tower. The weapon rack is actually very useful and comes with two great looking flags that are dark blue and metallic gold in color.

This set may not look like much, but it has everything one is likely to expect for the price and perhaps then some. Two opposing forces and a wide array of weapons bring a decent amount of playability into this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Plus+
     Great minifigures, the knight has a great breastplate, helmet, face and shield. Cool black skeleton horse, dark knight, great horse for the good knight, there is nothing bad with both horsemen. The tilt is great and the golden caps are a good touch. Also the flags on the weapon rack are useful if you put them on the end of the knights lance. The two new skeleton weapons are great.

Minus-
      The golden caps face only one side and look strange. The skeleton horse can't hold any weapons like the good knight's can. They could add a page in the set for the knight and add a $ or 2.

Equals=
       A great set to boost both the bad and good sides of your  castle kingdom. Well priced at $9-12 and in all a very nice set.

Compatibility
             This set goes great with any set lacking characters in the knights/skeletons theme. For example: Kings castle siege, one with two crossbow catapults, one with the dock. It won't go with tower raid because it has trolls. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
