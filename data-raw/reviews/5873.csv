"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-07-15T10:21:16.84Z","An...Improvement?","As most of us might recall, this set drew plenty of flak when prototype photographs were first leaked onto the internet, what with buzz that is was too small, or not complex enough, or not doing the ship justice. However, I believe it cannot be argued that it's nice to see another version of the venerable and memorable Sith spacecraft on the market. It's definitely sleeker, with a great collection of curvy parts, and perhaps a little more to scale. Plus, the Sith speeder bike looks a lot better rendered. So, an improvement? I think so, by a little at least.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Ant","2007-07-19T10:49:40.513Z","Potential","Great set, much better design that the first version (7151).
The Sith Speeder fits into the cockpit alot better this time, and the mf's cape is'nt squashed when the cockpit is closed.

The first thing that dissapointed was that Sith Infiltrator is significantly (but not overly) smaller that the first version (7151).

After having this set a few days, I thought it could have been nice (and this set was a good excuse for TLC) to have included a Qui Gon Jin mf in a new flesh tone version, with hairpiece, unlike in the 7665 Republic Cruiser. The fact that a Kit Fisto mf was included in 7661 Jedi Star Fighter with Hyperdrive, and 7660 Naboo Starfighter has 2 mf's shows that it could have been, if only for the sake of updating the old yellow mf's",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"_add_um","2007-08-31T11:45:06.113Z","Much better than the first","I just got this thing today and I have to say it's much better than the first. It includes Darth Maul (duh!) and 3 probe droids, I've noticed that Maul's face is a bit different when the last time he was released. The ship is a lot more sleaker than the first one. Inside you can store his lightsaber hilt but does not come with the blades so I use the ones on the side of the ship (but maybe they are the lightsaber blabes). The bike is way better from last time too and now is my favorite speeder bikes I have. Also I was looking at the box on the internet and on it said: &quot;limited edition&quot; but on mine it didn't say anything (??!)

"atperratore","2007-09-08T20:08:49.41Z","cool and sleek","this is a very beautiful set i got just today. i am very happy that they finally made another set with darth maul. the design is very nice, good color scheme, and well working landing gear. the only two problems are that the only way to give his lightsaber blades is to take them off the ship's guns, and that when the ship is &quot;swooshed&quot;, the wings will most likely move to an  unwanted position

If you didn't get the original set this is a good one to add to your collection. It comes with Darth Maul and his double blade lightsaber, and his speeder bike (that fits in nicely in the cockpit). The Infiltrator has to launching missles (if you ask me the missles always fall out and you have to use your hand to push them out) that really don't go too far.

"wyoeaglefan","2008-10-14T10:22:51.373Z","Pretty good redesign","I purchased this set from Lego Shop at Home after being unable to find it in any stores. I have to say that it was a good buy for the price. The construction is a little weak if you're not careful with it but it is still swooshable. The only part that presents a problem is the front cover for the cargo hold. Another con would have to be the lack of 2 extra lightsaber blades for Maul's hilt. I know they included 4 blades, but they whould've accepted those as details to the ship and not forced one to take them off to use. The speeder fits snugly in the cockpit and the overall design of the ship is just very well displayed. This remake is far superior to the original and I highly recomend it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoguysw","2008-03-09T15:17:55.2Z","chunky but cool","The last time i reviewed this set, half the review was 'left out', as in for some reason it was deleted. So here is the re-review:
PROS:
The ship actually holds Darth Maul and speeder bike (though Darth Maul must sit on the speederbike during flight). By sitting on the bike, he can reach the computer, which is a dark black one.
Wings open and shut.
Probe droids(hardl a PRO, actually.
Double bladed lightsaber(More on that later).
Darth Maul figure.
Inside area to store tools.
Binocular things.
Landing gears.

CONS:
No actual lightsaber blades*
Only holds one minifig**
Speeder bike is a bit fragile
Probes have no detail except an anttena
Wings come off, but not that easily(phew, they are on click hinges)
Only one minifig (needs a Qui Gon! Then this set really would be awesome!)
Landing gears are fragile/not very sturdy.
Notes

**After little modification, you can fit one person where the probes should go, one on the speeder bike in the back, and the probes can go in the nose cone at the front. Now this set really is good!

*Its almost good you have to put the saber blades on the side, as the lightsaber has a place in the ship it wouldnt fit in with the lightsaber blades on. (Use the red sticks on the sides as the lightsabers blades).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2008-03-10T18:30:24.797Z","&quot;This is my apprentice, Darth Maul. He will find your lost ship, if only he could find his own.&quot; (Said by Palpatine with a little splash of Leggodt)","This set wasn't really what I had expected in a set that actually comes with Darth Maul. Here are some cons then pros(putting the bigger list first):
      
         Cons: 
           -ship is too wobbly especially in the front 
           -door that leads to cockpit breaks too easily 
           -probe droids don't show much detail 
           -rockets don't fire that easily 
           -lightsaber has to use the ship's guns for blades 
           -wings bend too easily(they don't stay in place well)
           -landing gears spin?(WEIRD) 
           -the cockpit doesn't have a chair for Maul to sit in
           
         Pros: 
           -comes with darth maul minifig(most sets don't)  
           -the speeder bike is more detailed 
           -the speeder bike has a little clear piece under it 
           -comes with binoculars which is movie accurate 
           
Over all, this set really didn't impress me; it just wasn't the big, bad darth maul ship that I had hoped for(kinda explains the title). However, I do think that you should only get this set if you missed the first one, like me. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-24T15:45:50.297Z","The Sith Infiltrator","This is the current Lego model of the Sith Infiltrator. Released in 2007, as an exclusive special edition of USA and Canada, i bought my set by the brazilian version of the Ebay, and it costed 35 dollars (due to the tax of import, it came by 35 dollars, and not 25 dollars). The price isn't bad for this set, due to be a Star Wars set in this size, it still good. The set is nice designed, and combines a cool color scheme, with some gray, dark gray schemes and with black and red colors in few details. In accuracy to the movie, it too still good. The Sith Infiltrator can be builted in two parts, on the back, there is the cockpit. Using a semi retangular brick as a base, it is well fixed. Some plates above, with different shapes, makes a pass to the speeder stay on it. On each side, there are more bricks in different plates, on basically black and dark gray colors, making some details, and also fixing well. The cockpit isn't much great, the darth maul's minifigure stay on the speeder and it stay fixed on the floor, so, Darth Maul cannot reach the controls (on his front, there is a brick with some printed detailed controls), but it is good positioned, and Darth Maul can &quot;watch&quot; it. The enter to the cockpit is made by a detailed circular brick, and it works by some plates with a different shape to movement other plates when fixed, it works very well, and it covers the cockpit. On each side of the cockpit, are some circular spaces to more bricks fix on it, and these connects the wings. The wings are made by few bricks and plates, connected on a semi circular plate. Each top of the wings have two flaps, like the original Sith infiltrator, and this too works right. Increased by more gray bricks, on the plates that connects the wings, there are the flick &quot;missiles&quot;. These don't works correctly, due to the pieces used on it, these don't fix, so, fall when you're playing with, but it can be changed, with some few improvements, and extra pieces. Above this part, there is a circular piece that have some printed details, and this increases more the set. The other part of this Sith Infiltrator is connected by some bricks with a circular shape of suit. The division of the two parts isn't much visible, because some other gray bricks stay increasing above it, and it still well. On the other part of this Sith Infiltrator, there is a chamber inside, and there, are keep the three dark eye probe droids, the lightsaber (without the lights, these are on the sides of the ship, increasing it, but can be too used on the lightsaber as well)and the Darth Maul's ocular device. This chamber is covered by some plates, increased with gray bricks, and this is connected by a device using pieces with the technic style, and too two red bricks. It don't stay very well sometimes, when you're playing with it and you pull it inside strongly, but it don't occur much easy. On this part of the Sith Infiltrator, the bricks above and some on each side, with black, gray and dark gray colors, increase the design and makes it better, with accuracy with the movie. Under the chamber, there are very well fixed bricks and the common landing system, with two supports, altough only two, these are good positioned, and the Sith Infiltrator still in feet with it. This set also includes the &quot;Hard to Find Darth Maul minifigure&quot;, as the box says. One of the better designed Lego Star Wars minifigures, this is more black, and have the correct red details on the face, also the yellow sith eyes. The minifigure also have a cover, made by two pieces. The speeder included is simple builted, altough useful, and better in the design than the old version. Altough the minifigure don't fix the legs on it, it still fixed well with the hands, and the speeder stay in feet. Overall, this is a great value set at all, nice designed, good builted (altough somethings like the part above the chamber connections could be more fixed), and very cool to play with. So, it is a great option to get the Darth Maul's minifigure, and also his spaceship, speeder and much more of the new Lego Star Wars stuff. 5/5 is the rate for it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Darth Maul mini fig- super cool
Doubled Bladed Lightsaber- must take 2 of the red blades off of the ship to assemble it.
3 Probe Droids
Binoculars
Cockpit- Has controls printed on a brick , Darth Maul must sit on his speeder bike while he's in the vehicle. I think it's a neat idea because it stores him and his speeder at the same time.
Cargo Hold- Holds probe droids, lightsaber hilt, and binoculars. You must take one piece off to open this.
Speeder Bike- Nice design, small and cool.
Wings fold shut and open
Landing Gear
The ship is a nice size
Great pieces
Not too expensive, but it's not cheap either.
Good color scheme, better than the first one.
Great Playability and good display
Easily customizable

Cons:
None

I would recommend this to any Star Wars fans, Darth Maul fans(me), but if you aren't into Star Wars this might not be your ideal set. I would't recommend this set to real little kids. 

Enjoy!

"Jim_Java","2008-08-03T07:13:10.89Z","A Cool Sith Gets A Cool Ship","For a while, I thought LEGO would never get back to Episodes I and II.  Maybe the TV show set in the Republic Era coming out gave them incentive. A good thing too, because now we get the awesomely sleek and cool ships that come from that time period-Like this one.
The Sith Infiltrator is Darth Maul's ship, from Episode I. As such, it comes with Darth Maul, a speeder, binoculars, several probe droids (A note about these later), and (GASP! GASP!) his excellently cool DOUBLE LIGHTSABER! Yes, this set comes with a LEGO lightsaber, and two red &quot;saber&quot; pieces.
About those probe droids-They're black minifigure heads with black switches on top. I had no idea what they were. I actually thought they were some kind of engine, since you're supposed to place them in the hull of the ship.
Then there's Darth Maul's speeder bike. It looks pretty neat. However, it is a little easy to break-but it's still cool.
The ship itself is easy to build, and once you assemble it, it looks superbly sleek. However, like the TIE fighters, its door can come off on accident. However this is minor. And you can detach the hull to make the remaining part of the ship (the wings, and Darth Maul's cockpit) look like a Republic Era TIE Fighter.
Overall, this set would make a pretty nice buy. At 30 bucks, it's not overpriced, and it looks cool even just sitting there. And it has Darth Maul, the coolest Sith ever. What more reason do you need?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kris","2009-01-09T07:54:17.843Z","An Improvement On The Original","I purchased the Sith Infiltrator new, for £22 which seemed a moderate deal at the time, nothing special, but I had Lego buying urges, (that I assume your all familiar with) in essence the ship splits into 3 parts, includes a Darth Maul minifigure, and a small speeder, which DM sits on, to 'interface' with the Infiltrator, also included are several rudimentary probe droids, which are black lego heads with antenna on, and binoculars.

Pros

• Excellent looking Darth Maul Minifigure
• The infiltrator is far sleeker than its predeccesor
• No Stickers(even though there is a modest amount of printed pieces only)
• Reasonably pleasing build
• Good selection of grey & bley, particularly for vehicle MOCers
• Reasonably shooshable
• Silvered lightsaber
• Well designed accessory compartment

Cons

• Flick fire missiles are abyssmal, and constantly fall out, which requires a little modding to stop them from doing so
• Rear canopy has a tendancy to flop open if the Infiltrator is tilted upwards - my solution was to move the rounded 2x2 understud back
• Darth Mauls twin bladed Lightsaber has to be cannibalised from the Infiltrators own weaponry
