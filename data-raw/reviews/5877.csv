For the 2007 models, I only bought this one - for myself - because this is the only one that has two rocket launchers.  Kongu was assembled then boxed again, but the launchers are great fun.  After you get the feel on how to fire them, they can be used for a lot of games, with or without Lego.

Her also has the best color scheme with the dark green and metru gray pieces. Kongu is the best character suited for using his canister part as a base seeing as he has both cordaks. I don't see why people complain about the cordaks becasue both on this set worked perfectly for me and I enjoy firing both of them at my sister simaltaneously.

"Zatth","2012-01-05T20:55:37.733Z","Kongu: Teach them Barraki the true Meaning of Crossfire!","&nbsp; My name, Zatth, exemplifies my feelings for Bionicle. I was always a huge fan of the sets and the story since 2004, when I was old enough to get really interested. But, enough about me.<br><br>As you can guess, my username (which is the same name as Kongu's mask), should tell how I love Kongu Mahri. <br><br>And I certainly am impressed with him, as I am with all the Mahri. Kongu is a good sized toa. With his arms raised or stretched out he looks extremely tall and imposing. His build was a good choice by the designers. His bulkiness may at first seem odd for a Toa of Air, but this added weight and stability means that he can balance his long arms and heavy weaponry on their ends quite well, making him great for posing.<br><br>And he is great for posing. If you like stick 'em up shots or just action shots in general, Kongu make for a great display model. If you want to photograph him well, though, I would suggest shooting him at an angle with his eyes visible to you.<br><br>Beyond poseability, there is playability. I must say that melee weapons are often better for play, but Kongu is a good exception. His impressive size and truly heavy artillery that he's toting can really make the difference in a battle. (I was always a fan of overkill ranged weaponry). He can pop in on the Barraki's party and completely obliterate them with his Cordak blasters. Even better is when you own another Mahri, then his melee-less woes are solved.<br><br>There are just a couple cons with Kongu. (Pun intended).<br><br>His head: Hi head and mask are a sleek design, just great for a Toa of Air. But they do pose poseability problems. (Another pun intended). They're hard to turn, because of his hunched look, which don't exactly befit a Toa of Air. Not as bad as Mahri Hewkii's though. And, as mentioned before, there is the no-melee-weapons factor. This poses advantages and disadvantages, so if you like melee weapons, I would suggest another Mahri.<br><br>Nonetheless, Kongu is a fantastic and is wonderful fun to add to any bionicle collection. I was able to buy him from a friend for 10 dollars, if you can get him within a reasonable price for you, then by all means, get him. You won't be sorry. Cheers!<br>",TRUE,5,3,5,5,5

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2015-10-06T10:39:36.167Z","Disappointing and odd, to my thinking, but I understand the appeal","<p>Kongu dates back to the launch of the line. His first appearance was as one of the six McDonald&#39;s Matoran. He had a lime green body, a teal Kanohi Miru, and was armed with a humble Bamboo Disk. After that, he didn&#39;t appear again for a while - the Le-Matoran and Onu-Matoran were left out of the 2003 Matoran releases. But in 2006, he along with three of his fellow McDonald&#39;s-originated Matoran plus Hahli and Nuparu were mutated and powered up into Toa, gaining new masks, powers, and weapons (in his case, a sword/crossbow). In 2007, the same team chased the ever-troublemaking Mask of Life into the depths of the ocean - and got mutated again to aquatic-adapted forms.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Being a Toa Mahri, Kongu comes in a box in a plastic frame rather than a cannister. His instructions are clear and easy to follow. While as is sadly to be expected for a post-2005 Toa, there are no alternate-model instructions, there is at least an inventory.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Kongu comes with assorted pins, axle-pins, and red 2-length axles, two dark green Toa Hordika right arms, a dark green torso piece that only came in one other set (and was a different color there) an astromech body/fuel tank piece, dark green Toa Metru kneecaps, Toa Inika thigh armor, and Rahkshi feet, dark bluish-gray Vahki legs, Toa Metru legs, horseshoe joints, a dark bluish-gray Toa Metru waist piece, a Toa Metru head, a shorter eyepiece for the Toa Metru head that has an axle socket in the back, a translucent green dome, a silver hose and Toa Metru chestplate, Kanohi Zatth, the Mask of Summoning (Which, much like its predecessor the Kanohi Suletu, resembles a mutated Kanohi Miru. The Zatth gives him a cheap knockoff version of Aquaman&#39;s signature power - he can summon creatures, but can&#39;t choose or command what he summons. Like all the Toa Mahri masks, it also marks a return to standard-style masks), sixteen Cordak bullets... and two Cordak blasters. Note what is conspicuous in absence.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Kongu has a slightly more complex torso build than is common for Toa from this era, as the balls for the shoulder joints are supplied via the Hordika limbs rather than being integrated into a torso piece. He also takes the unusual route for the Mahri of building the air-recycling tank onto the back of his head, hence the special eyepiece. Otherwise, not much to discuss about the build. It&#39;s simple enough, and sadly like the previous year it lacks any true Technic gimmicks.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed Toa Mahri Kongu is hunchbacked, and has his arms angled backwards to easily support the twin Cordak blasters that are his weapons. He&#39;s a mix of dark green, and dark bluish gray, and stands well. The ball joints give him a decent range of articulation, and his look is overall solid. Extra bullets for the Cordak blasters are tucked into his arms.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>There are things I like about Toa Mahri Kongu, and things that bug me about Toa Mahri Kongu. I like his mask, it&#39;s very stylish and the fact that it keeps up the resemblance to the mask Kongu originally wore is another plus about it. The predominantly dark green color scheme doesn&#39;t bother me with him like it does with Toa Matau - it actually feels appropriate here because of the &quot;Aquatic mutation&quot; theme. The rebreather tank in the back of his head is also neat and fits with the contours of the mask, although it does mean sacrificing light-piping.</p>

<p>The first and most glaring thing that bothers me is the lack of a Toa Tool. Every full-size Toa set released up to this point, had included a unique Toa Tool (or sometimes a pair thereof) for that Toa to wield (granted, the Toa Hagah&#39;s spears recycled existing parts toolings for the heads, but still). That Kongu does not have one and instead just comes with a second Cordak blaster is fairly disappointing. Another thing that kinda bugs me, but mainly just has me tilting my head a bit, is his lesser height and his posture - such has generally been the province of Earth Toa (heck, even Whenua&#39;s Toa form was built shorter than his teammates), so having him be short while Nuparu is still lanky feels rather odd. The lack of Technic gimmickry and the somewhat-reduced alt-build potential is also a disappointment for me, but that&#39;s because those had been among the main draws for me when it came to the toys. The lack of a cannister is also a bummer.. ah well, resealable sandwich bags to the rescue I suppose.</p>

<p>As Kongu is the first Toa Mahri I&#39;m reviewing, I&#39;ll also give my thoughts on the Cordak blaster. It looks cool, and the concept is cool, but it does have its downsides. It doesn&#39;t have too many options for connecting it to other parts, it&#39;s bulky and heavy, the firing mechanism isn&#39;t always reliable, and unlike the previous year&#39;s Zamor Sphere launchers, it&#39;s rather weak. But it does at least have looks and can be fun to fire (unlike, say, the Thornax launcher).</p>

<p>All in all, Kongu is more-or-less passable in my book. I say more-or-less because the lack of his own unique Toa Tool is a major disappointment, but there have been worse. He&#39;s got good looks and articulation, so if that&#39;s what matters to you in a Toa set he won&#39;t disappoint, and if you&#39;re more into stuff like the Cordak Blasters then you get a double-helping.</p>
