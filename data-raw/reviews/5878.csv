"dy_enforcer","2007-11-24T21:32:35.217Z","The Leader of the Toa Mahri","Jaller has some nice parts and he is very fun to pose.His mask and his sword are the best thing I have ever seen.His pet Hahnah crab really suits him and Cordak Blaster really fires,Just press hard enough and it will fly off.What I really like about the set is the new parts such as Jaller's chest armour(Also use for a crab)and his mask called Kanohi Arthron.Jaller's Mahri form is the same as the Inika form except his Energized Flame Sword changed into a Power Sword,His Inika head turned back into a Metru head which is a good thing cause I really don't like the Inika head that much and the transparent orange ball joint pieces are replaced by the regular ones.At first,Jaller's toa mahri design is like a diver because of the tubes,but,its not because if he is a diver,he should have a air gas tank in his back.His tubes represent as gills for breathing underwater.So,here are the Pros and Cons.

Pros:

-Fun to pose
-Color scheme is great
-His pet Hahnah crab suits him well
-Cordak Blaster can really fire if you press it hard
-New pieces such as Jaller's chest armour or a crab body

Cons:

-No more light up swords

Overall: 5(9/10)A great set for bionicle fans out there.So buy it right now before its sold out.

"Jim_Java","2009-03-28T15:24:40.03Z","No, That's Not His Foot...","First of all, I would just like to let anyone confused by the picture know that Jaller does not have a crab for a foot.  The crab is attached to Jaller's Cordak blaster, which is chained to Jaller.  I am not sure what the benefits are to having an undersea creature carry your gun for you, but since this feature can be easily corrected, I won't complain.
Mahri (Is it supposed to sound like ""Marie?"") Jaller is pretty neat. He bears little resemblence to Inika Jaller, aside from the cool  red-and-orange coloring, but this is not neccasarily a bad thing, since Inika Jaller had one of the (how do I put this?) less-threatening masks to come along in BIONICLE.  
Obviously, he's a pretty simple build, basically copying the Inika in structure, but thanks to the crab, he can be modified quite a bit.  At present, mine has a shoulder-mounted Cordak blaster, a lavaboard similar to Tahu Nuva's, and a crab fused to his chest.  He also has had the breathing tubes taken off his mask, and inserted elsewhere. The tubes are cool-looking, but complicate taking the mask off when inserted into it.  
The negative aspects of this figure are pretty small, and basically amount to it ripping off the Inika, and not coming in an actual canister. Yes, Jaller and all other Inika come in a plastic frame with cardboard on the back. Once the cardboard is removed, the plastic is basically useless for storage, although technic pins can inserted into it.  A shame, since the back is one of the better ones in a while.
Overall, Jaller is a pretty good figure. I would say to get him if it you want one of the Mahri, and you aren't interested in what they do in the stories. (Becuase then, Matoro takes the cake.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"BionicleBOOM","2009-03-17T20:31:14.31Z","Way better than 2006","Boy, now that I have four of the six Toa Mahri, and brother has the other two, it's hard to decide who you like most, but I still like Hahli the best.  But Jaller, with his Hannah crab and all, is pretty neat.  Way better than his previous form.  I like how they used the same piece for the crab as they did for Jaller's breast plate.  Overall, there's nothing really remarkable about him, but somehow you are able to like him.  A lot.

Pros:

-Crab w/ Cordak blaster

-Two (2) Mahri tubes

"NickBrick","2010-11-20T19:16:55.707Z","Machine gun!","This was my first Bionicle, and a pretty cool one at that. The toa mahri were some the main sets that got me back into Lego. I wanted something reallistic. Something with a sword, plain, and simple. So I got Jaller. Jaller is very pose-able. The rahi that comes with him though has one major problem. Its eyes don't fit in the sockets! Jaller's mask is very good.<br><br>And the tubes make it look like he has a breathing mask. Now, is there anything I missed. Oh yeah! The Cordak blaster is great and fires six rubber pellets. It confused me at first that you had to really slam down on back of the blaster to make it fire.<br><br>A very good Bionicle indeed. However. I feel I should warn you that the quallity of the plastic<br>has been bad since 2006. And now my copy of Jaller has had his arms broken off. and his legs are cracked.<br>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,5
"PaulTR","2010-12-30T18:31:43.497Z","Possibly the Best Toa EVER!","<p>When I saw Jaller in the LEGO Shop at Home catalogue, I was really excited. However, as fascinated with him as I was,&nbsp;I&nbsp;had some questions: Was he sturdy? Did those tubes limit movement? And what's with that&nbsp;Cordak-weilding crab thingy? Thankfully, Jaller has exceeded my expectations beyond belief, and I think he is one of&nbsp;the best Toa sets ever!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, Jaller looks amazing.&nbsp;His orange, red, and black color scheme&nbsp;is perfect, and hearken back images&nbsp;of the good old days of the&nbsp;Toa Nuva and&nbsp;Metru Nui. This is compounded by the fact that his awesome&nbsp;lava sword&nbsp;looks like a mash-up of Toa Lihkan's&nbsp;great swords, and Toa Tahu's beastly twin fire blades.&nbsp;Jaller's armor is also really unique and cool looking,&nbsp;and while it's not as flashy as his Inika armor, it looks just as good.&nbsp;I also really like his mask; in my opinion, Jaller's previous&nbsp;Inika mask was the black,&nbsp;ugly&nbsp;sheep of the Inika lineup. However, this new mask looks ten times better, and I think has to be&nbsp;near the top ten coolest&nbsp;Toa masks of all time.&nbsp;The only con with his looks that I can think of is some people&nbsp;say his chest sticks out&nbsp;a little too much. However, I just can't see&nbsp;that it does, no matter how hard I look. And trust me, I would spot&nbsp;a&nbsp;thing like&nbsp;that&nbsp;immediately, as I'm pretty obsessive about reviewing my Bionicles.&nbsp;Now, its bonus time: Jaller's Hannah&nbsp;crab also looks fantastic, and looks just&nbsp;like a crab should: feisty, angry, and armed with some nice claws.&nbsp;So, in the looks department, Jaller&nbsp;is&nbsp;a front-runner in the ""Coolest, Most Retro Looking Toa"" beauty pageant, if there is such a thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jaller was also a great and fun build. His body is made like a standard Inika or Piraka build except one&nbsp;thing: his chest armor is cleverly attached to his body through the use of black axel pieces, and his mask&nbsp;tubes wrap around to his chest. Combine this&nbsp;with his&nbsp;VERY cleverly designed crab, Jaller is probably one of the better canister set builds I've seen for a while. Jaller also includes some really great pieces: plenty of orange and red legs and arms, a cool weapon, 2 chest/crab pieces, a new mask, and some&nbsp;useful tube pieces. Its a great blend, and I think MOCers will be very pleased.&nbsp;Overall, Jaller's pieces are fantastic, though I must admit&nbsp;there are some other sets with more unique pieces (Hahli's wings are a good example). But this slight downside is blown away by the fact that&nbsp;Jaller has&nbsp;more pieces, 68 in fact, than any of the other Mahri. Yay!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jaller is tons of fun to play with as well. You can swing his sword, shoot his Cordak blaster, and have his crab jump on Barraki (""Whoa, dude, get off! We're, like, the same species!""-Carapar). I think Jaller's fire sword is amazing, and you can use it to put the hurtin' on the Barraki with back-handed swipes, or flat out lunges.&nbsp;And if you're&nbsp;skeptical of a Toa of&nbsp;Fire having a little crab haul his Cordak blaster&nbsp;around, you can just take off the chain, and use the post/axel piece to attach the blaster to his&nbsp;hand&nbsp;like the other Mahri.&nbsp;Sweet! And as far as those restrictive-looking&nbsp;tubes look, not too fret; they don't limit movement&nbsp;very much, and they aren't as tight as Hahli's.&nbsp;However, while Jaller is very fun to play with,&nbsp;there are some issues with Jaller's playability. First, the Cordak blaster, while fun, is&nbsp;a little hard to shoot.&nbsp;Thankfully, it's not as bad as the wretched squid&nbsp;launchers. In fact, Jaller has a slight advantage over his fellow Mahri: since his bulky&nbsp;Cordak blaster is on a crab and not tucked close to his body, its much easier to hold and shoot.&nbsp;As another con, however,&nbsp;Jaller does not include any action features like gears or extra points of articulation. Boo. But Jaller completely redeems himself in the poseability field! You can make him glower at his enemies, strike an agressive pose with his sword, and&nbsp;look victorious as he recovers the Mask of Life (I actually don't have the mask of Life piece, so I use Dekar's&nbsp;mask instead;) All in all, Jaller is a really poseble guy, and&nbsp;along with his crab you can make&nbsp;some really neat poses. And, he looks amazing next to his fellow Mahri, especially Hahli.&nbsp;But enough&nbsp;of my&nbsp;talking! Let me stack&nbsp;up the facts for you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Looks absolutely stupendous (so does the crab!) 
<li>-Fun and unique build 
<li>-Useful and cool pieces, like his fire sword 
<li>-Sturdy and fun to play with 
<li>-More pieces than the other Mahri 
<li>-Includes a Hannah crab 
<li>-Fun to pose</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Cordak&nbsp;blaster a little tricky to fire 
<li>-Not as many ""Whoa! Check this out!"" pieces as the other Mahri 
<li>-No gears 
<li>-Head a&nbsp;little restricted in movement</li></ul>
<p>Well,&nbsp;should&nbsp;you get Jaller? Uhhh, could I make a more rehtorical question!? BUY HIM NOW! He&nbsp;is the best of the Toa Mahri, and quite possibly one of the best Toa ever created.&nbsp;Even if you&nbsp;only get one&nbsp;Toa Mahri, Jaller is the guy you should pick.&nbsp;And if you want to&nbsp;try to buy all&nbsp;of the Mahri, than&nbsp;he's a no-brainer. In my estimation, he's the best&nbsp;$10 US dollars I spent on Bionicle (Besides Hydraxon :) So, hit the internet and&nbsp;get Jaller!&nbsp;Trust me, you won't&nbsp;regret it!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5

"CaptainBrick33","2021-06-06T16:15:59.377Z","The best BIONICLE ""canister"" set!","<p>After writing some reviews of Ninjago sets, this is my first Bionicle set review. But why am I reviewing Toa Mahri Jaller first? Well, it&#39;s simple. In my opinion, Jaller Mahri is the best Bionicle canister set released. Here is why:</p>

<p><b>Packaging</b></p>

<p>The Toa Mahri were the first Bionicle &quot;canister sets&quot; not to be released in a canister. Ironic, huh? Like his brothers (and sister), Jaller was packaged in a cardboard packaging with a plastic cover. Unfortunately, I have bought this set used and it did not come with the &quot;box&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Instructions and building experience</strong></p>

<p>The Instructions are fairly standard for a set like this. The building experience is also pretty straight-forward. After building the Toa Inika, you can construct&nbsp;Jaller Mahri without using the instructions. At least there is a minor amount of complexity in the tube and armour placement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>As with all Bionicle canister sets, there are some interesting parts included. For parts, which were new at the time of this set&#39;s release, we have Jaller&#39;s mask (the Kanohi Arthron), Jaller&#39;s aquatic power blade, the Cordak Blaster, the silver tube, the lower torso armour and upper torso armour, which is also used for the Hahnah crab&#39;s body. However, the only exclusive piece is the&nbsp;blended red-and-orange Arthron. There are no recolours.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Since there are no minifigures in Bionicle sets, let&#39;s look at the two models, starting with Takua&#39;s best friend, Toa Jaller.</p>

<p>Out of all the Toa Mahri, Jaller has arguably changed the least compared to his Inika form. His legs and arms are identical, though the transparent orange has been swapped with normal orange. His body is a bit different though, as it uses a new armour piece. However, because of how wide it is, it limits arm movement greatly. Underneath his mask, he has a standard Toa Metru head with greenish eyes, matching his previous version. There are also some tubes, which connect to the mask and to the torso armour, which surprisingly don&#39;t restrict head articulation. On Jaller&#39;s back there are three holes, in which you can put three spare Cordak rockets. He wields his&nbsp;aquatic power blade in one hand, and a chain to guide his crab friend in the other.</p>

<p>Jaller Mahri is actually the only Toa set to include a Rahi side build (I&#39;m not counting&nbsp;Toa Lhikan!). The Rahi here is called a Hahnah, which are crab-like animals that lived in Mahri Nui. The crab is built using Jaller&#39;s upper torso armour, a pair of silver Piruk claws and some pieces from the Barraki (eyes, teeth, etc.). I think the Hahnah looks great for the small number of parts it uses, and it&#39;s a great companion to Jaller. It holds a Cordak Blaster on it&#39;s back, which I&#39;ll get into in the playability section.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>The only play function in this set is the Cordak Blaster, which is attached to the Hahnah&#39;s back, though it can be held by Jaller using an axle rod. It can shoot six missiles at a time, but I&#39;ve often had some trouble firing them. Sometimes they shoot out really well, and other times they don&#39;t. And from what I&#39;ve heard, other people have the same issue as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because Jaller Mahri is a standard Inika build, he has all the normal points of articulation. In total, there are 13 points of movement on Jaller, and 3 on the crab.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>So, is this set any good? Let&#39;s recap:</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Lots of new pieces</li>
	<li>Nice looking sword and mask</li>
	<li>Rahi companion</li>
	<li>Good articulation</li>
	<li>Blended pieces!</li>
	<li>Good amount of pieces for the price (68 in total)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Armour restricts arm movement</li>
	<li>Cordak Blaster doesn&#39;t work well</li>
	<li>Standard Inika build</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, Toa Jaller Mahri is an excellent set. It has possibly the best value out of any medium-sized Bionicle set, with it including two substantial builds, some great pieces, and an overall very solid design. While the main play function of this set, the Cordak Blaster, isn&#39;t the greatest, the pros definitely overcome the cons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Should you get this set? Absolutely!</p>
