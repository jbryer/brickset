"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2008-01-04T15:47:35.153Z","Almost Decent","Hewkii used to be the Toa Mahri I wanted most out of the collection. Now that I've seen him, I have to say my opinion has changed. 

You are all familiar with the canisters, and how they are difficult to open, but there is something else about Hewkii's canister. It was very well done, and the combination of the black and yellow on it look amazing. However, the set is nothing like this. The colors don't flow that well, and Hewkii reminds me more of a walking/talking caution sign. 

The Build is relatively simple. The only area I imagine anyone would have trouble is with attaching the Cordak blaster, or twisting the pipe the way you want it to go. Even then, they are pretty simple tasks. 

There are a few parts of the design, though, that, to be honest, fail. The shoulder mounted blades (while looking cool on that canister picture and on the set) make positioning the arm really awkward, as they keep running into Hewkii's head. The other issue is with the upper leg armor (the mace pieces). They look very out of place, and don't fit the water environment he's supposed to be in (why would you want weights attached to your legs?). Ditto for the chains, which serve no purpose.

One thing people may complain about is the backwards torso. However, after reversing it, I realize that it looks just as, if not more, strange than it's current configuration (the shown neck is a tad awkward looking).

I've had more fun with the Cordak blaster than any other projectile since the Kanoka disks (which simply means more fun than Rhotuka and Zamor). The Cordak don't fall out when the launcher is moved, and they shoot far. They're a bit hard to fire when attached to a figure, but this is a minor detail, when it can just be taken off.

There is one downside to the blaster. It's that it makes the set a bit side-heavy. I don't know if all the sets are like this or if it's just mine, but this makes the set unstable with standing, and has to be carefully positioned to keep it standing. Again, this may just be my set. 

As far is playing with Hewkii, he does seem like he would be fun to play with, as he has a cool spear and a nice blaster. I don't really play with sets anymore, but I'm sure someone who does would have fun with this guy. 

It's easy to tell that Lego was trying to be original with this guy. Different thigh armor, new way of attaching  blaster, and shoulder blades all point to this fact. However, between the blades and the pointless chains, I must say it didn't work out to well. This is why Hewkii went from most wanted, to not decent. I'd give him a 3.5 if I could, but since he isn't a 4, I had to score as a 3.

"shima55","2007-10-04T13:30:24.45Z","He's OK","Hewkii is a fairly decent Toa Mahri but I am glad he isn't the first one I got.

Pros:
Hewkii has an amazing selection of pieces.
These pieces are in very good colors.
His new Kanohi and tools are good.
With practice, the Cordak Blaster is effective.
Leg armor is good.
Chains are awesome.

Cons:
Lacks chest armor.
He is awfully short.
His bladed shoulder makes posing difficult.
The fact that he has no right hand looks very odd.

Overall, I think Hewkii is a good set, but I wouldn't get him as my first Toa Mahri.

"witzenHammer","2008-01-08T13:26:53.547Z","pretty cool, but what's up with the wasted plastic parts.","Hewkii is cool. pretty wicked looking even if the the shoulder blades conflict with the masks winged flange shape.

Blaster is way to heavy for this guy's joints. It would seem his long handled blade is there only to make him hold a standing position when holding the gun.  Gun works easier than the squid shooter I guess.  Love the feet.

But What is the deal with the packaging?  Sure it looks cool and makes you want to buy it, but, what a waste of resources to make the sculpted plastic frame around this package. It would be justifiable if there were more than the couple peg holes it has. All LEGO needs to do is put some of the cross holes, more pin holes, or some studs, then it could be incorporated into MOC's in some sort of way, or used to stand them up, but this is just a huge plastic hunk of uselessness.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-11T23:04:38.513Z","very cool","i got this set for christmas along with three other bionicles, at the beging this guy was my least favorite but now he's worked his way up to the best as ive played with him more

pros 

the gun will shoot pretty far
cool feet
lots of blades
i like his mask
chains 
tube
the blaster is attached diffrently then all other toa mahri
if you take the blaster off and use the spikes on his upper legs and a chain you can make a flail

cons

the gun is to heavy for him
the shoulder blades get in the way of his mask but thats no big deal
no body armor! that really &quot;miffed&quot; me lol

this is a good set and is realy cool. i would sugest him, i dont know if hes the best but hes one of them ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"PaulTR","2010-12-28T18:49:09.547Z","Not the Hewkii We Know and Love","<p>My brother had bought the Inika version of Hewkii, and I liked him so much, I decided to&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;Hewkii's Mahri version.&nbsp;However, my experience with him almost made me not want to buy his fellow Toa. While Hewkii does have some good things going for him, he also has quite a few negatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hewkii is not a very good looking Toa. With his oddly shaped mask, asymetrical&nbsp;body, and his lack of armor, Hewkii is probably the strangest looking Mahri as well.&nbsp;Another problem is there&nbsp;are too many attachments on Hewkii: he has 2 blades on&nbsp;one shoulder, bright red Cordak ammo on the other,&nbsp;chains on his arms,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Cordak&nbsp;blaster in one&nbsp;hand, and spiked knee caps.&nbsp;I think the designers tried too hard to make him seem like a tough, multi-weapon weilding Toa. Even his color scheme is confusing: he has black legs, silver weapons, yellow arms, red spikes, and a very&nbsp;annoying blue axel/rod underneath his head.&nbsp;Honestly, the only&nbsp;remotely cool thing about him is his mask; it&nbsp;vagualy reminds me of a stingray. Also, he is probably the most unique looking Toa (although ""unique"" also ryhmes with ""freak"")&nbsp;But besides this, Hewkii&nbsp;is a total bust in the looks department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hewkii's build is pretty standard, and not very different from&nbsp;previous years. His body is composed of Piraka and Inika pieces, and is supplemented by some silver weaponry. Overall, Hewkii was a&nbsp;pretty easy build.&nbsp;However, Hewkii does have some good pieces: new silver knives, his war blade,&nbsp;a new&nbsp;tube piece, and&nbsp;an interesting mask. Also, he has 2 chains and a pair of spiked Technic pieces.&nbsp;So, at least Hewkii&nbsp;is not a complete bummer&nbsp;with&nbsp;his included pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Hewkii really falters in the playability field.&nbsp;This comes from&nbsp;the fact that his&nbsp;right arm is limited in movement by his 2 shoulder&nbsp;knives. Also, his Cordak blaster cannot be moved very much due to&nbsp;the lack of a hand piece on his right hand.&nbsp;As another&nbsp;disapointment, the Cordak blaster is slightly hard to fire. Mercifully, its much easier to use than the Barraki's squid launcher.&nbsp;And as&nbsp;far as poseability goes,&nbsp;the less said about it, the better. Since he has less articulation than other Toa, his poseability options are&nbsp;very low. As far&nbsp;as his 9.99 US dollars, I'll just say this:&nbsp;I find it hard to justify. Well, lets&nbsp;check out the&nbsp;facts, and see if we can scrounge up some good things for Hewkii:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Plenty of useful pieces 
<li>-Interesting mask 
<li>-Unique look 
<li>-Tons of silvery&nbsp;weapons</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Not very cool looking 
<li>-Too asymetrical 
<li>-Boring build 
<li>-Cordak hard to fire 
<li>-Less articulation than other Mahri 
<li>-Poseability options limited</li></ul>
<p>So, should you get Hewkii?&nbsp;Well, that depends. If you just want to get one or two Mahri, I would&nbsp;NOT recommend Hewkii. However, if you&nbsp;already have&nbsp;three or four Mahri already, you should pick him up. Yes, he&nbsp;has some serious issues. However, he does look good with&nbsp;the other Mahri, and at least you can take him apart for some good pieces :/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,3

(just kidding) anyway, i'd like to say he does NOT have 2 hands&nbsp;unfortunately. but he does have a LOT of blades. as well as another con: Spike armor. i mean, if you buy hewkii you&nbsp;basically HAVE to buy carpar so you can switch armor on the 2! well, if you want him to look GOOD that is... anyway, he has 2 chains on the back of his arms, witch were actually featured in one of the comic&nbsp;issues: he used it to hurt gadunka because there ""electro chains"" so that makes a HUGE upgrade on play-ability. but of course: i have to get to the pros-cons cause' UP is on disney&nbsp;Chanel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
