There is also a red handrail for safety as well as a red mooring post for any boats wishing to moor up.   The fisherman comes complete with stubble, sunglasses, blue baseball cap and life vest, just what he needs considering the size of the shark he is about to reel in!   The shark is the traditional issue two-piece set with movable jaw.   The fishing rod features the flexible rod, line and reel, and of course the bait attached to the end of the line.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This little model is a part of value pack #1721 and thankfully so, if it had been sold on its own the money value for it would definitely score a lot lower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said it's a fun little addition to the other models from that value pack. It gave you a third Mini-Figure, a small little pier to build up, a fishing pole (The only one I ever had I believe.) and of course the familiar looking Shark. What more can I say about it? Overall if you're interested in getting another Mini-Figure and Shark for your LEGO Town/City then I'd say track this one down. Even better if you can get the entire value pack for a decent price, because the other models really add to the fun of this one. On its own, I'd have to say it's mildly recommended for the fishing pole accessory alone, seeing as how that piece is hard to come by... When's the last time LEGO even used that piece as an actual fishing pole in the LEGO City/Town theme???</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
