"shima55","2007-10-04T13:47:40.67Z","My favorite Toa Mahri","Nuparu is one of the best Toa Mahri, even though he hasn't changed much from last year.

Pros:
Shoulder and leg armor is amazing.
His new Kanohi is my favorite Mahri mask, it incorporates the tube well.
He has good poseability. 
Very versatile pieces, especially the silver mask.
I love the use of the Piraka feet.
With practice, the Cordak Blaster is very effective.
Shield is cool.

Cons:
His body is the same as last year.
The fact that his Toa tool is a shield instead of a melee-style tool like the other Toa Mahri have makes him look somewhat out of place.

Overall, an extremely good set, and I would definitely recommend him for your collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-11-03T20:31:42.34Z","A Decent Break After '06","The Toa Inika of 2006 are by far my least favorite Toa team of all time (setwise and storywise). So when I saw that the Toa Mahri were pretty much the Toa Inika with some different stuff attached, my first thought was 'Oh great. Here we go again'. 

But I got this set, and I will say he is MUCH better than his Inika counterpart (although I still don't like him storywise, but that's for another time).

The canister that Nuparu came in is pretty attention grabbing. It shows Nuparu in an action pose shooting his Cordak blaster. The back is also nicely decorated with a wheel with some pictures on it. They show Voya Nui, Mahri Nui, etc. But it also shows you how to use the Cordak Blaster, and it shows how it (the blaster) can be mounted on the canister. Cool eh? 

But what's not cool is the canister itself. It's strangely packaged, and requires much ripping and tearing just to get it open. I managed to get the set out without harming the canister, but most of you won't be that patient. 

The build is not that easy, surprisingly. I actually had a lot of trouble getting the the feet attached, and had to bend sections at angles they shouldn't be bent at to attach them. There was also a bit of controversy when attaching the upper armor pieces on the arms and legs (which are new pieces, by the way). The instructions show them one way, but later on show them another way. It's not hard to figure them out, but it would be nice to have the instructions right the first time.

When it comes to playing with him, Nuparu is easily more fun than all the Toa Inika combined. You can actually keep the ammo in the shooter without it falling out, and the shooter actually works! (Some would debate this statement, as some people tend to have trouble with the launchers, and sometimes the ammo does get jammed, but Nuparu has replacements if that happens). The only issue in this area is with his arms and hands. They are the Piraka arms, so they only move up and down, and can't go any other direction. This is relatively annoying if you would like the tools to be positioned other directions, and it's where I was forced to take a point off (It also annoys me that his shield has two gaping holes in it. Doesn't do a whole lot of good).

All in all, Nuparu Mahri is a huge improvement over the Inika. Minus the flaws mentioned in the arm, he's very fun to play with (the Cordak blaster alone could provide hours of fun). In total, he deserves a solid four of five points.

PS. It's worth a mention that the head and masks are one the things which make the Mahri an improvement over the Inika. No over extended necks or green blobs this time.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

first of all comes with a cordak revolving blaster like all his comrades.comes with a shield which is kinda out of place cuz all the other toa mahri have melee weapons but nonetheless it works as a melee weapon as well.nuparu(besides kongu and hali) is the only toa mahri(in my opinion) suits the underwater theme best by having flippers(piraka feet)a air tank backpack a mask that incorporates the tube well(and resembling a gas mask) some new armor on him


PROS:
cordak blaster
cool kanohi
tube
backpack
shield
extra ammo

CONS:
same body from last year
cordak shots easy to loose

"PaulTR","2011-06-05T20:05:37.547Z","Nupara Vill Terminate You!","<p>I&nbsp;got Nupara back in '07, along with all the other Mahri. I hadn't really read any reviews on him, so I didn't know&nbsp;if he was&nbsp;great or not.&nbsp;Turns out, I had nothing to worry about, as&nbsp;Nupara is a fantastic Bionicle set!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nupara, in my opinion, is&nbsp;one of the best looking Toa Mahri. His mask is easily one of the coolest looking masks&nbsp;in the Bionicle universe; it looks down right mean with its silver color and slanted eye slits, as images of ""Terminator"" come to mind. Nupara's body is&nbsp;fabulous as well, with armor covering his legs, shoulders and chest.&nbsp;The shield is also a great addition, with it's&nbsp;silver coloring and artistic design. In all honesty, there's not much&nbsp;to NOT like about Nupara's looks;&nbsp;the only thing that&nbsp;might be&nbsp;odd to some is&nbsp;when viewed from the side, Nupara's shoulder and thigh armor jut out a little bit, giving him an odd side profile. Also, his legs have&nbsp;semi-large holes were his hands and feet attach, due to his Piraka limbs.&nbsp;Still, it barely bothers me,&nbsp;and I'm extremly&nbsp;critical&nbsp;when it comes to&nbsp;Bionicle figure's looks. Overall, I'd say&nbsp;Nupara is a&nbsp;fantastic looking Toa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A pretty standard Bionicle cannister set, Nupara was a pleasent build. He is constructed in basically the same way as his Inika form, using the same chest armor and body technique. His arms and legs utilize Piraka arms, while his back sports a small&nbsp;tank. It's a good design, although it has been used before; indeed,&nbsp;Nupara is probably the&nbsp;least retro&nbsp;Toa&nbsp;out of the Mahri.&nbsp;Still, his slightly medicore build can be forgiven when you analyze the pieces you get:&nbsp;4 new armor pieces, a beautiful mask, new tubing, and a truly amazing shield. The shield alone is extremely useful; MOCers&nbsp;will definitely have a field day coming up with uses for it! His mask is also&nbsp;fabulous; I'd&nbsp;say it's&nbsp;a&nbsp;only&nbsp;second&nbsp;to Jaller's mask, which I consider the best mask of the&nbsp;Mahri.&nbsp;So, while Nupara's build may be a bit lackluster, his parts are not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Mahri's&nbsp;Earth-dude is&nbsp;also fun to play with. You can smash&nbsp;Barrakii in the head with his shield (""Hike!&nbsp;Oh yeah!&nbsp;We have a football sack on Ehlek!"") and pop Cordak rounds out of his&nbsp;blaster. It's also fun to balance him on his shield (""Look,&nbsp;Makuta, no hands)!""&nbsp;However,&nbsp;the blaster is a bit tricky to fire, and I'm disappointed Nupara's blaster is on its side, as this makes it&nbsp;trickier to fire when compared to the other Mahri.&nbsp;Also, Nupara has no gears or ""action"" features. Now,&nbsp;I'm not a stickler for gears or ""action"" features (I prefer awesome-looking sets to poorly-designed, gimmicky ""action""&nbsp;sets any day&nbsp;:) I'm just saying, compared to earlier sets, Nupara&nbsp;(and&nbsp;by extension, most of the Mahri) doesn't have as many play&nbsp;features. However, Nupara redeems himself&nbsp;with his poseability: You can&nbsp;make him hide behind his shield,&nbsp;extend his long arm to pump rpunds at Barrakii, and glower down at&nbsp;baddies with&nbsp;his terrifying mask. Indeed, Nupara's mask alone offers tones of great picture oppertunities, as&nbsp;his red eyes and silver coloring are amazing looking.&nbsp;The only bad thing is&nbsp;that&nbsp;Nupara's weapons and legs&nbsp;can only move in a limited arc due to his&nbsp;Piraka arms and legs. Still, it's not that bad; there are other&nbsp;Mahri that score much lower in poseability (Hewkii and Kongu: yes,&nbsp;I'm looking at&nbsp;both of you!).&nbsp;But you didn't&nbsp;read this review so I could spout steam about other sets, did you? No,&nbsp;what you want is...The List!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Looks&nbsp;very beastly 
<li>-Mask is incredibly cool-looking 
<li>-Solid and sturdily built 
<li>-Great pieces (Awesome underwater&nbsp;shield? Oh yeah!) 
<li>-Fun to play with 
<li>-Scores very well in the ""photogenic"" dept.</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Armor may stick out too far for some 
<li>-Build is nothing new 
<li>-No gears/action features (minus his Cordak) 
<li>-Cordak a little tricky to fire 
<li>-Poseability a bit restricted</li></ul>
<p>So,&nbsp;at $9.99 US dollars, does Nupara make the cut? You bet!&nbsp;Nupara is a fine Toa, and while&nbsp;his build may play it a little too safe for my liking, I think his looks, pieces, and solid build&nbsp;far out-weigh his negative traits. Indeed, I would&nbsp;put Nupara in the&nbsp;""upper rank"" of the Mahri (along with Hahli and Jaller). I would strongly recommend him to any&nbsp;Bionicle fan, even if you're a ""gear hugger."" After all, why miss out on&nbsp;an oppertunity to get an official, LEGO Terminator mask? :P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4

"123MrBrick","2015-07-07T01:05:47.223Z","Then I Crashed Into You...","<p>I recently bought Nuparu because I had a lot of fun with the Happy Meal version when I was younger. Also note that I don&#39;t have a lot of experience in terms of Bionicle sets.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This figure, along with the rest of the Toa Mahri, came packaged in something a little different from most Bionicle Toa. The canister is just a plastic shell with some cardboard and plastic inside. The only thing really worth preserving is the outer shell. The art on the front was nice, though. I had no problems with the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has some cool parts, like Nuparu&#39;s mask, face, and his shield. The Cordak blaster is also fun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set was fairly easy. It took me a little longer to do it because I&#39;m used to CCBS sets. There is nothing too complicated, however, and I&#39;m sure experienced Bionicle fans could build Nuparu very quickly.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great! I can&#39;t believe how big Nuparu is. The Cordak blaster is fun if you can get it to work.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I love this set. It has some cool pieces, an awesome mask, and a fun weapon feature. I paid about 17 USD for a complete with box figure on Ebay, but the original $10 price is definitely worth it! I can&#39;t wait to get the rest of the Toa Mahri.</p>
