"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2008-01-04T16:30:17.013Z","One of the More Decent Mahri","The canister image portrays Hahli very well, and in a way that is bound to attract consumers. It's a decent enough canister, portraying Hahli on the front, and an image of Mahri Nui on the back, along with other pictures that demonstrate functions, show storyline, etc. It's a bit hard to open, but you get over it eventually. 

One part of the set that capture my attention was the build. It seemed strange not starting with the torso right away, and attaching he mask sooner than usual. Otherwise it's a simple build. The only real issue is with the tube. It's somewhat difficult to find a good way to attach them to the mask so it looks natural, and so the pipes won't detach from resistance. I would have preferred a different way of attachment, one that's easier to deal with. 

Hahli's color scheme is loved by some, and disliked by others. I am rather fond of it. The combination of dark blue and lime green is much different than what we're used to (combinations of blue and light blue/silver), and different is always good. I also find it as a representation of her mask power, which in the story adapts powers from creatures around her. The lime green gives the sense of bioluminescence, which is something used by creatures underwater.

Another thing that makes Hahli original are her (new!) wings. The first thing that came to my head about them was: why? After all, the characters are water based. I then concluded that this was another way to signify the character's mask power. Besides, either way, they really do look nice, and can even fold behind her back for storage. Her other tool, a claw, I am not as fond of. It doesn't look horrible, but it's not an amazing tool either. 'Claw' isn't necessarily the first thing that comes to mind when I look at it. But it is a major improvement over her previous Inika tool, so she needs credit there. 

Playing with Hahli is fun. The Cordak blaster is especially fun. It shoots really well, and pretty far. The ammo doesn't fall out, either (like the previous Zamors and Rhotuka). The only downside is that the blasters are a tad heavy, but this isn't too horrible if the joints on the set are good. 

To conclude, Hahli is one of my favorite, probably my second favorite, Toa Mahri. Good design, nice (new!) wing pieces, and a good source of fun earns this set a 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-02T09:24:55.043Z","Cool, but not so good quality","The Toa Mahri innovate some pieces, but some of they have problems, like Hahli's problems. Hahli have a awesome design, but i don't like much the weapons. I think that the Hahli's talon is not that thing for a water toa, and the cordak blaster don't blast easily. Another problem, and the most terrible, are the lime green pieces. Like Ehlek and Lesovikk, these pieces broken so easy, and that is a obstacle to do creations with Hahli. I hope that the 2008 Lewa nuva lime green pieces will not broken easy. But Hahli have some good things, like the wings (they are not so good for a underwater toa, but are good designed), and the mask, really what i was searching for a water toa.

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-21T17:00:49.043Z","Toa Mahri Hahli ROX!!","My favorite set of all time (don't rib me because it's a girl), Hahli is definitely a ten out of five.  I don't know what's so special about her; maybe it's the wings, talon, Cordak launcher, and the all-together water feel about her that appeals to my eye.  So, what's the Pros and Cons?

Pros:

Wings (that's definitely #1)

Cordak Rocket Launcher

Talon

Mask is AWESOME!!

Very very VERY posable

Cons:

Lime green pieces do, in fact, break very easily.  Luckily, it was easy to get replacements.  But now that Hahli's discontinued, I dunno what I'd do if they did now.

Other than the breakable green pieces, Hahli is one of the best sets Lego has EVER MADE.  Get Hahli now, but just be careful about the lime green pieces!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:

-good mask with breathing gear

-i like the shape of the body parts
-nice head

"Nmfrey23","2022-01-01T20:54:35.73Z","My favorite Toa of water","<p>Hahli was an interesting set in 2006, and her Mahri set in 2007 kept up with that trend. A brand-new colour scheme, deadly looking claws&nbsp;and actual wings are just a few of the changes that Hahli saw in 2007. I would almost wholly reccomend this set but there is one major issue that this set, as well as a select few sets from 2007 have&nbsp;that makes this&nbsp;set infinitely worse.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New parts: The mask, claw, blaster, breathing tubes and visor are all new parts. There are also many old parts in new colours, like many of the lime green parts.</p>

<p>The set has a unique build to allow the wings to attach (not just standard Toa Inika format).</p>

<p>Wings can move and have a large range of motion.</p>

<p>Cordak blaster works well (holds six shots).</p>

<p>I personally love the colour scheme of navy blue and lime green</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Weapons are somewhat awkward looking when held.</p>

<p>Due to the tubes and larger mask,&nbsp;head movement is somewhat limited.</p>

<p>I cannot stress this enough. The lime joints. They are even more brittle than joints from 2008-2010. I am not sure what was wrong with the lime pieces in 2007, but if you are receiving this set new or disassembled, take care when building it, since the joints don&#39;t just crack, but they will often break into two pieces when attached with too much force.</p>

<p>If you manage to build Hahli without breaking a sweat (or a lime joint), you will likely enjoy the end result. Hahli fits the underwater theme of &#39;07 very well, and has cool features and weapons to boot. 4/5</p>
