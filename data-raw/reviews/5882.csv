the mask is great, love the blue part although i wish it could fit on other masks as well.

three Av-Matoran white feet
two Inika lower legs white
two white Inika shoulder armors
two Inika upper leg armors
two razor-claws
four red small + shaped pins

Matoro has more pieces but they are hard to describe. Anyway, my brother is starting a Star Wars movie        so, I gotta go

"james3426","2009-10-20T14:54:03.607Z","The Hero of the Universe","Matoro is a good Toa, but he has small problems. To start off, the Kanohi Tryna, mask of reanimation is a cool mask. It has a tube hole and and the axle in the back is longer than usual to fit that translucent blue cover on it. The method of the classic foot attached to the torso, for the head to go on is interesting, but he's a hunchback, which also means limited head pose-ability. The twin cutters I think are one of the best blades ever invented because, at their backs, there are rigid teeth. Then, the blades nicely curve. The black tubes that run from Matoro's back to his cordak blaster, I think are a little weird.

Pros:
Cool mask.
Twin cutters.
Cordak blaster shoots well.
Cool shoulder pads.

Cons:
Black tubes look weird where they are.
Hunch-backed.
short arm.

An okay Toa Mahri, but get a different one if you can.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"PaulTR","2011-06-16T10:26:44.35Z","A Worthy Carrier of the Mask of Life","<p>When I first saw Matoro, I was put off by his odd appearence. Nevertheless, I decided to buy him and see if he was a dud or not. Surprisingly, I found Matoro to be a great canister set that any true Bionicle fan should try to get!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matoro's appearence is very different from most Toa. He's slightly hunched over, asymetrical, and his mask is one of the more interesting masks in the Bionicle universe. Matoro's&nbsp;body is very unique, and&nbsp;thus, fits in extremly well with the Mahri's individualistic looks; his&nbsp;coloring is also very&nbsp;cool looking, with it distinctive silver, light blue, and white elements.&nbsp;While many&nbsp;people would contest Matoro looks&nbsp;too strange for someone who is destined to carry the Mask of Life, I would disagree. Yes, Matoro doesn't really look like&nbsp;your standard,&nbsp;heroic Toa, but that's not what Matoro's character is about; he's an&nbsp;ex-scholar, who is weighed down with the responsibilty of eventually&nbsp;carrying the Mask of Life.&nbsp;Thus, I think his hunched over and&nbsp;slightly odd&nbsp;appearence is appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matoro's build is by far the most interesting out of the Mahri. An&nbsp;Inika back is used to support his upper frame, while a&nbsp;Toa Nuva foot&nbsp;is ingeniuosly used for his chest, with his head attached to where the lower leg joint is supposed to go.&nbsp;His upper arms sport silver armor on&nbsp;axels, which provide flexibility for his arms, while his right, lower&nbsp;arm is different from his left in that it uses a different piece. It's a very unique build; even amongst the highly-unique Mahri, Matoro's&nbsp;design stands out.&nbsp;My only complaint with his build is that Matoro's head is slightly restricted by the foot piece, and&nbsp;a red Technic piece is used for his chest, which is slightly off-color. Still, it is barely noticable, as the foot does a good job of covering it up. As for pieces, you get some useful&nbsp;Inika armor, light blue arms and legs,&nbsp;black tubing pieces, and a cool, silver&nbsp;mask.&nbsp;I was pleased with the pieces, although I will say Matoro has less ""Ooh! Look at that!""&nbsp;type of pieces when compared with the other&nbsp;Mahri.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matoro is fun to play with in the underwater setting of the Pit. You can make him flash his twin ice cutters, crouch behind rocks, and shoot his Cordak blaster at the Barrakii. It's also fun to pretend Matoro can use his Mask of Reanimation to ressurect the ""bones"" of Technic pieces, if you're actually into ""playing"" with your sets :) However, I will&nbsp;say Matoro has some problems with playability: he lacks any&nbsp;""action"" features (minus his Cordak), his head is&nbsp;slightly restricted in movement, and his Cordak blaster is at times a nuisance to fire.&nbsp;Matoro's slight lack of head movement also translates into lessened poseability options; however, while&nbsp;he's not the most photo-genic Toa out there,&nbsp;I will say he's not as bad as Hewkii Mahri's lack of poseability, so don't&nbsp;let me discourage you too much.&nbsp;As for his $9.99 US dollar MSRP, I would say he is fairly priced. He's a unique and truly individualized set, which is a breathe of fresh air from so many awesome-looking, but generic&nbsp;Toa/Baddie clones over the years. Well, I've said my peace! Let me stack up the facts for you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Very unique appearence 
<li>-Eye-pleasing color scheme 
<li>-Most unique build out of the Mahri 
<li>-Useful MOCing pieces 
<li>-Cordak fun to fire (when it works) 
<li>-Fairly priced</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Appearence may not please everyone 
<li>-Chest restricts head movement 
<li>-Not really any new types of pieces 
<li>-No&nbsp;""gear"" features *moans from old-school&nbsp;fans* 
<li>-Cordak a bit tricky to fire 
<li>-Poseability not the greatest 
<li></li></ul>
<p>In this humble reviewer's&nbsp;opinion, you should definitely try to get Matoro. While he may not be the flashiest&nbsp;or most awe-inspiring set, Matoro is a truly unique guy.&nbsp;I know it may sound corny, but I think he exudes a lot of emotion, with the&nbsp;quest for the Mask of Life weighing on his mind. If you can find him, don't miss out on him!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"Nmfrey23","2022-01-02T01:12:08.327Z","There goes my hero...","<p>...And I&#39;m certain that many Bionicle fans in 2007 watched him as he went. Matoro seems to share some similarities with Zane from Ninjago. Both are related to ice in some way, both acted reserved until it was time to act and both ended up sacrificing themselves for the greater good.&nbsp; Matoro is certainly an interesting character, but how is his Mahri&nbsp;set? Well, the set introduces new parts and weapons as most canister sets do, but there are a few things that make this set special to me.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Shoulder pads, claws, Cordak Blaster, mask, visor and tubes are all new.</p>

<p>Very good-looking colour scheme of sand blue, white and silver.</p>

<p>Overall look: Matoro Mahri has somewhat of a different stature compared to the other Mahri. He&#39;s built more like a hunchback as opposed to standing straight up. The bulky leg armour and shoulder pads also add to this look. As odd of a combination it is, I really like the overall look.</p>

<p>Cordak blaster works well (Holds 6 shots). Matoro&#39;s blaster is also slightly modified. Two black tubes connected with 1x2 technic beams are attached to the back.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some may dislike the asymmetry of the arms.</p>

<p>Tubes near the face may inhibit head movement.</p>

<p>May have some balance issues since he uses smaller Toa Mata feet.</p>

<p>Blaster looks somewhat awkward.</p>

<p>I&#39;d definitely recommend Matoro Mahri. Not only is he one of the most important characters in the entire theme, but he also makes for a good canister set. 4/5</p>
