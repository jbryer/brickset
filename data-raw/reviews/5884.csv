"UKVampyr","2007-08-06T17:08:56.3Z","8273 All Terrain Truck","Quite a nice set with lots of intricate studless design.
Built the main design Sat 04/08/07 and on sunday took me ages to dismantle to create the 2nd design.
The first Design features working steering, rear tilt type suspension, a working tipper body and tipping cab. Also included is a pallet hoist with rotate and lift functions at 2 points, and at the fron there is a winch for getting out of muddy wallows.
The detailing on the truck is quite good I think.

The 2nd model uses the same rear suspension as the first model but the model is articulated in the middle using the turntable to enable suspension type effects at the front.
This model has a working rear crane with boom lift.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Routemaster","2008-04-12T02:27:19.623Z","This set really deserves a 5 !!","I built more than 22 Technic Sets the last months. The small ones and of course the big sets. So I guess I know what I am talking about.

The Off Road Truck has a great size. Not too big, not to small. In my opinion this is the Technic Set with the most functions. The playability of this set is totally awesome.
I like the color scheme on it (finally NOT yellow OR red).

If you plan buying a Lego Technic Set and can live without those power functions (forget the Cherry Picker - it's boring!) and don't want to be disappointed when it's ready then this is the right choice for you. 

This Technic Off Road Truck is really worth the money.

"japkleine","2008-12-19T02:12:11.873Z","Totally amazing Set","I really love this set. And my four-year-old son loves it too. He is too small to have helped me to build it together, but he loves playing with it. This show how sturdy it is. It took me about four hours to put it together (with little breaks in between), but it was fun to build. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow and the result is worth the effort. I had to get used to the new system LEGO uses with its Technic Sets, but once you get used to it, it is really easy and you have fun to put the whole thing together. Now I ahve read some reviews, where there were complaints about That LEGO puts all the bricks in bags and doesn't sort them. With this set there were four backs and they were exactly the brickc you needed to build the different parts. By the way, who doesn't love sorting through all the LEGO bricks and getting them all in order? That's part of the fun, isn't it? 
The prize range was OK. I got it for round about 40â‚¬ and it was worth it. I only built the first set, the other I still have to try, but I can imagine that it is equally well designed and built. 
I really recommend it for anybody who wants to buy a set that is not overly expensive but that has almost a thousand pieces and is fun to put together and has a lot of functions which makes playing with it lots of fun.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"headwerkn","2010-03-19T09:27:00.373Z","An excellent Technic set","<p>A couple of years ago this one was my foray back into Technic after a spell of probably 4-5 years. This was my first venture into the new studless design too.<br />
<br />
Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Satisfyingly long and complex build</li>
    <li>Sturdy model<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>High part count</li>
    <li>Excellent number of functions (steering, winch, tray, jib), especially for a non PF/Pneumatic set</li>
    <li>Nice B model (though not quite as good at the A model).</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nothing really! The 'special bits' count is rather moderate, perhaps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certainly worth it if you can find one for sale!<br />

"Mandalorian","2010-10-29T12:20:12.51Z","Simply amazing!","I bought this set from a nearby lego store that still had it, and everything about this set just seemed (and still seems) to be amazing. First, youve got like six functions using gears, so you get a huge supply of them, an amazing piece count for this price and a wonderful building experience. The B-model is also cool, but not nearly as much.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Lots of great functions</li><li>Even more great functions</li><li>Huge amount of wonderful pieces</li><li>Awesome build</li><li>Cool B-model</li></ul>Cons:<br><ul><li>What cons?!</li></ul><br>Trust me, if you see this set, buy it, no matter how much it costs, and if you can't get it anywhere, order it online. No chance you'll regret it.<br><ul><li><br></li></ul>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Techman","2012-06-17T17:30:51.203Z","A functional technic model, could be better","<p>This set I purchased for the standard price for $50.00. This was great because the piece count was at eight hundred parts. So the piece ratio was fantastic. The build had numbered bags and there are several booklets from which to build off of. The secondary model looks nice but I haven't built it yet. I got this set because I was drawn to all of its features. The steering and tip bed and crane boom. All were sweet to use and play with. The down side it that there isn't and engine block or drive system. The back wheels have slight suspension but the front axle doesn't? Oh well. The boom can be hard to control given that the knobs are small, but it still is great to use and watch it work. the tip bed uses a nice linking mechanism to push and pull the liftarms back and forth to bend the bed. The front cab also bends forward and can snap into place to secure its position. The set is surprisingly small in width in comparison to other models like the 8292 or 8109 for example. While all of these are great, this set has no motors like the ones above, but relies on manual turning to manipulate the functions. The set has great pieces, but not many gear varieties. They all consist of 12 and 20 tooth gears mainly. The set offers a ton of liftarms and blue elements. I like this set, but not as much as the 8070 for example. Not to deter you from not considering this awesome set, but it still is a great display piece and for functions it packs over eight functions in total. If you can still find this older kit, go buy it because it has many functions that will keep you busy for a while. And when you're done, build something else out of it or make the secondary kit. This kit is a good addition to anyone's collection and look great too.</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
