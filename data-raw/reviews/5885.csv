It's 'torso' are two bionicle pieces for connecting arms and legs. Only buy it if you're a fan of bionicle.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-10T14:46:40.78Z","Ok, small promotional","This is one of the bionicle promotional sets released in 2006. This promo set is of course, small, so, this must have comparison with other promotional sets with the same size. The set involves a basic building and few pieces. The color scheme of the set is gray, with red arms, green eyes, silver weapon and black feet. The legs are small, the same of the matoran of metru nui, in 2004, and also the feet, used too in the bohrok. The body is made with two pieces, used to make a part of the legs or arms of some toa, piraka, some barraki, makuta and others. The body is simple and the pieces are useful, but the playability is poor. The head is like the other toa, and have a green piece as eye, useful for some matoran from 2006 and 2007, because these don't used eyes. The arms are the arms of the red vahki, still good, but so long in relation with the legs and not much playable due to the body's construction. The weapon included is a small blade of the staff of the rahkshi guurahk. Good altough small, but it could have two of these blades. Altough is a small promo, this set is not the best small to buildi and play, but still in something, like the useful pieces to make another set, good. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"xboxtravis7992","2020-01-12T04:36:20.39Z","Sets from Spare Parts","<p>Set 6934, Good Guy released as a promotional polybag bundled with Disney comics in Sweden; is a strange set. Appropriately so, this set entered my life in a strange manner... many Lego fans often assumed Good Guy was made from spare parts, a surplus collection of Bionicle pieces that Lego just tossed into a polybag for a small one country promo. They are probably right, I can name a dozen possible sets that could have produced the surplus Lego factory parts that led to this set.<br />
<br />
So appropriately, my Good Guy was born in a way similar to his original Lego factory packaged cousins; spare parts from a few Bricks &amp; Minifigs&nbsp;bulk parts purchases... the loose detritus of the memory of the Bionicle&nbsp;age. I first started stuffing parts for Good Guy into my bulk parts purchases at Bricks &amp; Minifigs when I realized how easy it would be to recreate the set from spare parts alone. Not surprisingly, it didn&#39;t take long before l had a nearly 100% accurate Good Guy on my Bionicle shelf; the only difference being swapping the black pins for the more common red pins. Of course I didn&#39;t need instructions, one look at a few photos of the original set was all I needed to know how to build Good Guy.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So how did such a small set with a dull build made of spare parts and released exclusively in Sweden becomes a &quot;I gotta make this&quot; project from spare parts?<br />
<br />
Well, Good Guy took on a life of his own in the Bionicle fandom. From memes, to appearances in fan films such as the SuddenlyOranges&#39;&nbsp;<em>Reviving Bionicle&nbsp;</em>series; to popular fads of collecting Good Guy sets and swapping his parts colors to make &quot;bad guys&quot; or &quot;good girls&quot; or other oddball creations... this set has sort of become the unofficial mascot of the Bionicle fan community in the last few years.<br />
<br />
Yeah; forget classic Bionicle characters such as Tahu, Gali, Vakama or Takua... this nameless creation with no place in the stories&#39; canon became the face of a fandom. Good Guy sets have been &quot;upgraded&quot; to wear $20,000+ dollars of Platinum Lego pieces and solid 14K gold masks by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BionicleArchives/photos/a.798492073577928/2546672188759899/?type=3&amp;theater"">fan collectors of rare Bionicle memorabilia. </a>MOC makers have built massive &quot;Titan&quot; scaled renditions of Good Guy, or exo-suits for the small figure to pilot. The fandom surrounding this one little set is insane.<br />
<br />
Sure we can blame it on Millennials&#39; and Gen Z&#39;s collective nostalgia for all things from their childhood; but the continued presence of Good Guy reminds me of one of the best aspects of the Lego fandom; boundless creativity, the ability to pluck the most obscure and turn it into something relevant. Sort of the same message the first Lego Movie tried to make with Emmett the construction worker; anyone can be special if they believe it. Perhaps just as the Blue Classic Spaceman is a symbol of childhood creativity for countless Lego fans, maybe... just maybe... Good Guy is becoming that for&nbsp;my generation. If I was rating this set alone on build quality, it would be a 1 star terrible hack-dash job; but as a burgeoning iconic of the Bionicle fandom this guy deserves all the fame he can get! A symbol of how with Lego and a bit of creativity, anything is possible for even the most non-descript sets.<br />
<br />
So next time your in a random parts bin of bulk Lego, and see a few familiar Bionicle pieces floating around... consider making your own Good Guy to take home with you! As they say, Play Well.</p>

"Nmfrey23","2022-01-02T20:42:50.697Z","The most powerful being known to Earth","<p>Good Guy &#39;06 is a force to be reckoned with. Just look at his muscular legs that he uses to speed across the landscape. Gaze in awe at his&nbsp;brawny red arms that he uses in feats of godlike strength. Mask power? He doesn&#39;t even need a mask. He proudly shows his face to all around him. If he were to even swing his mighty blade once, he would cause the ground to tremble.&nbsp;OK, so jokes aside, Good Guy is meant to be a promotional set that serves to show how Bionicle&#39;s building system works rather than to be a stand-alone set. Even still, good guy is an official set, and he does have his share of pros and cons.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>For a 16 piece figure, good guy has decent movement (2 joints in the legs, 1 per arm, and one in the neck).</p>

<p>Contains a variety of parts and is relatively cheap (even sealed).</p>

<p>Has an uncommon blade piece found only in 2 other sets (Turahk &amp; Rahaga Norik).</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Torso is uninteresting and incomplete looking.</p>

<p>No mask.</p>

<p>Box/Polybag art shows the wrong weapon.</p>

<p>Overall, good guy is not anything stellar, but he is decent enough as a promotional set and can still be found at a cheap price even today. So why not check out Good Guy today, and continue his legend?&nbsp;3/5</p>
