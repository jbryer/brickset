Like all the other promotional sets of bionicle, this is just simple, with few pieces, no new features, but have some useful pieces, that makes this good. Altough small and so much simple, it have a considerable building system, for a little. The feet are claws, the same of the first onua, and the legs are two yellow pieces, part of the Toa Mahri Hewkii's legs, small but useful. The body is just one piece, connected with a part of a vahki, but these are useful, too. The arms are the same of the vahki Nuurahk, and the weapons are two of the Toa Nuva Pohatu's claws, but in yellow color scheme. The head isn't in a good position, is a head of the piraka, with glow in the dark feature on the teeth, and with orange eyes, but without the light up feature. Altough this set is a good in compariosn with some other small and promotional bionicle, the better to do with it is use pieces to increase other bionicle sets. Still good for a promo.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

There are not many parts, so you can easily build it into another, good looking model.&nbsp;<h4>Pros:</h4><div><ul><li>Great parts!</li><li>Fantastic colours!</li><li>Easy to rebuild!</li><li>Lots of possibilities!</li></ul></div><h4>Cons:</h4><div><ul><li>Small set (doesn't really matter!)</li></ul></div><h4>Overall:</h4><p>This set was so great, I built so many models, that this creature could use to adapt in various situations. I built so many models, so that I needed to write and draw them all on paper, so I wouldn't forget them.
