The windsurfing board is bright red and features a white two-piece mast and boom assembly with white sail which is detailed with blue and red stripes.   There is also a transparent section for navigation purposes.   The jeep is presented in a clean white colour with blue stripe down the side and palm tree graphic on the rear quarter.   The jeep also features a grill with lights, yellow wheels and off-road tyres, perfect for the beach.   The cab features opening doors and a tilting roof panel allowing access to the inside.   Placed on top of the jeep are two yellow clips, these are provided to hold the two parts of the windsurf mast in place while the vehicle is moving.   The surfboard can also be stored adjacent to this area.   The sail can be rolled up, secured and slid into the jeep through the rear tailgate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said I recall this particular part of the value pack with some detail considering I was quite fascinated by the look and feel of this model. The construction was fairly straight forward (if I can recall correctly) and the pieces always thrilled me because the windsurfing surf boards were always fun to play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The van included in this particular part of the set is a nice diversion from the few race cars and other sets I used to have, it isn't as impressive looking or sized compared to the recent Camper Van from the new City sets, but it was still fun to look at and play with, plus it was supposed to represent a single seater vehicle to take your Mini-Figure to the beach for some windsurfing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this set is a really fun looking older model from the Town era, I wish I could talk more confidently about it, but it has been a considerable time since I even had the models or Mini-Figure from this set. That being said I'd still like to say that it is a worthy addition to any modern City theme display. The windsurfing element is an aspect that is sorely missing in the modern City theme. A lot of the classic '80s and early '90s era Town sets offered a much more diverse group of people to populate your LEGO Town/City, there were certainly still a considerable number of Police and Firefighting based sets, but they were broken up by such things as Paradisa, the windsurfing liesure value pack and quite a number of other interesting little models that offered some actual citizens to play with and act as populace of LEGO Town. I'd recommend this value pack to anyone looking for a bit of variety in their LEGO City display.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
