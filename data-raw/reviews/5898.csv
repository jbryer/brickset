<p>A bit expensive for what it is but it comes well packaged and, let's face it, it's not rocket science to use. I gave it a test run against a stop watch and the accuracy is pretty darned good. It's also quite absorbing to watch the&nbsp;head twist itself around and make new faces every few minutes. The timer tick is loud enough to hear from another room but not too intrusive, and the alarm bell certainly makes you take notice without scaring the heck out of you.</p>
