The boat has a red waterline band, clean white hull with blue graphics and a red deck with forepeak vent.   The transom slopes gradually while a ‘cut-out’ allows access to the water, perhaps for swimming or boarding purposes.   The cabin has small blue portlights and an opening hatch allowing access to this area.   On either side of the cabin are navigation lights (port and starboard) which are mounted on colour coordinated brackets which protrude from the sides of the boat.   Slightly aft of these is the semi-flying bridge which features steering wheel, sports-style windshield and room for the supplied minifig.   Abaft of this area is a high radar arch mounted on white fins.   This features a rear-facing adjustable searchlight and burgee mast with running lights; two small VHF antennae are also fitted to the gantry.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I had a couple of rafts and of course the Pirates had their own boats, but for LEGO Town growing up this is the closest I could come to owning one of the impressive looking LEGO boats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pleasure Cruiser was tons of fun, I used to have a real ball taking the fisherman from Value Pack 1721 and sticking him on the back of the boat to fish for the shark. The ship looks quite nice and was always a fairly quick build, the Mini-Figure included with it was a nifty looking fellow and I enjoyed the life jacket pieces included with sets like these. Sadly most of my Town models were lost, pieces broke and discarded, instructions torn and misplaced or junked and eventually most of them wound up as spare pieces that were donated to my little cousin, including the Mini-Figures. (At least those that hadn't lost their heads to fading.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd have to say that if I was ever looking to replace all of those old Town sets I'd definietly start with this one, a LEGO Town/City can always stand to use some boats for the harbor and coast guard to interact with. Overall I'd say this piece/model was the crown jewel of Value Pack #1721 and the real money grabber for it. Although it says US ownly on the site I suspect that Canada also recieved this, otherwise how else could I have owned it? If you're looking for a fun little boat to add to your Town/City display I'd definitely recommend this one. The only trouble is I can't recall if it had any stickers or not for the details, sets around that era tended to use printed elements for details, but I could be wrong in this case.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
