"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-05T00:00:00Z","","Definitely one of the better Unitron sets, perhaps not so innovative as Crater Cruiser (1787) or Star Hawk II (1789) but a much more sound model, the construction and colour scheme being fairly well executed. There's no shortage of little features either, plenty of rotating, extending and elevating sensors to play with, and the rotating dome and seat too. Problem is... they're a bit basic - the Ice Planet base, for example, uses a rack mechanism to raise a rocket at one extreme and a radar dish at the other, compared to which the arrays on this seem a bit primitive. The buggy's quite neat, although the spaceship once again employs slopes as opposed to panels leaving the cockpit looky gappy and ill-conceived. The strange construct with the raising dishes would have been better if the canopy had been raised slightly to allow a minifig to fit in when the shuttle is off flying about, although it's good that Lego made the base compatible with the detachable cockpit system. However, the most annoying thing about the model has to be the fact that it's on a grey baseplate, whereas the Unitron monorail is on black baseplates - a pretty obvious oversight in my view. That aside it's an okay model, although nowhere near worth the high price it usually goes for.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-26T16:24:22Z","its pretty good!","I picked this one up at ebey with all other unitron sets and a monorail expansion pack for 6991. I was surprise by how many features it actually had. 2 good vehicles(the buggy is awsome) a huge lazer turret thingy that can hold the space ship and the base itself with the huge glass piece that can rotate. There is one slight problem. All the other unitron sets have black baseplates, not gray. this is why it lost a point. pleanty of little gadgets to fool around with too. it is a very good find, worth about$35 too me. i would reccomend it",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-25T23:42:19Z","Underrated","Just got this for christmas, i never thought much of the set until I got it. Now for the review!


The good:
-Doesnt use a Ramp and Pit plate like the contemporary Ice Planet and Spyrius bases.

-Good vehicles.

-Consistent &quot;theme.&quot; Zenon appears to be some sort of listening post, bristling with sensors and whatnot.

-The otherwise ugly unitron color scheme was put together pretty well here.

-an inexpensive way to get a unitron set if you cant afford a 1789 Star Hawk II

-a good &quot;small base,&quot; doesnt compliments instead of outshining the monorail

-GREY BASEPLATE, i know people have been complaining about not getting a black one, but now i finally have a grey baseplate other than those giant ones they sell seperately


The bad:
-Design seems kinda random and empty.

-Not sure whats the point of having rockface pieces half-covering some devices.

-No android like in the monorail

-One of the computer slope pieces has a diagram of a humanoid... im not sure why.


Conclusion:

Not a bad set, recommended.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-03-31T12:02:29.55Z","Unintentional spares","Unitron consists of a monorail, a space plane, a land vehicle and this base.  This station seems to be a set full of spares.  The huge dome looks out of place on its own and the hinged radar seems to be unable to make up its mind as to whether it's a detection or defensive/offensive system.  Two ugly BURPs hide what may be lasers and missiles or just telescopes.  The saving grace of the set is a rather cool rover, and the flyer, which also fits on the monorail.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Nova_Hunter","2007-04-19T21:40:03.023Z","Despite some weakness and emptiness in the overall design, Zenon is a fine Space set!","Space Station Zenon is quite possibly the largest of the space stations that Lego released in the 90s, containing more parts than even the Ice Planet base (As a consequence, it's also pretty expensive, or at least it is these days).

The first part of Zenon we'll be looking at is the main base unit. Depending on what you think looks better (Or safer for your Unitrons), the whole quarter area of the base can rotate 360 degrees when both of the rock faces are lowered on their hinges. When the rock faces are in their normal positions, the base cannot be moved, so your Unitrons don't need to worry about getting motion sickness. As for the interior, it's a bit empty. There's a neat-looking chair with a computer (That looks a bit low to use, but you can easily modify this with some basic plates) and rockets on the back. The chair can raise and lower with a hinge assembly, and can also turn. There are also steps at the front of the area to climb into the base. On top of the base is a small rader dish that's very flexible. It looks like it could be used for communications, or for frying enemies. You decide. There are a few more lights and antennae scattered around the base which are almost certainly used for communications, and not weapons.

The aformentioned rock faces, when lowered, reveal two missile-like devices that can raise, lower and turn. Those Unitrons are big on defense, aren't they? I'm not sure why the devices need covering, but it looks fine all the same. There's also a strange assembly with an antennae, which raises to reveal a small control panel. Again, this is probably for communication purposes.

A high point of Zenon is the large laser cannon in one corner. It's as flexible as the other devices in the base, turning, raising, and lowering however you desire. It has two rader dishes, a small cannon, and looks very dangerous. It can also dock a small ship, which I'll be getting to in a moment.

One vehicle and one spaceship compliment Zenon: A small buggy which has some antennea (Communications or lasers, you decide once again) and some cool trans-blue parts, and a small spaceship (With more lasers) that can dock on the laser cannon if the cannon isn't being occupied.

The minifigures in this set include the Unitron Chief and two generic Unitron astronauts. The figures have great-looking helmets and torsos.

All in all, this is a good set with great parts, but a bit expensive these days. You may have trouble finding it for under 60$. Pay no more than 55$ for this set, and even that's a bit of a stretch. But, this set had very limited production, so the price is understandable.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-10T20:35:00.077Z","Spare Parts","This set feels again like leftovers after the guys finished building their second space monorail.  The base is hideous looking and has some of the traditional base-like elements (launchable vehicle, rover, some crater elements), but it does little for me except as spare parts for my collection.  The best looking element is the ship that can blast off (similar to the Beta-1 Command Base).  This set is part of the Unitron 2.0 group, which had a nice color scheme, but the designs really stunk, imo.  I think they were trying to go for a more armored look with the numerous roof pieces, but the series did not feel very cohesive.  Here, I think the emphasis was on playability.  So you had more moving parts, but those really sacrificed for the aesthetic points.

For instance, the radar/craft launcher piece.  It appears sloppy.  Also, the supposedly hidden rockets inside the mountain/rock formation pieces.  The large blue base/shield/window thing to me was a lazy way for Lego to make a set look bigger than it seemed and just ends up wasting valuable space.  That whole section isn't even enclosed so it feels empty.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-29T22:20:15.467Z","cool parts but hardely a base","Well, the little car is nicely designed and one of my favorite parts to the base, and the little ship is also halfway decent. The rocks covering the technogayly is a feautre present on this and the spyrius base and i hate it. The satlette dish is pretty sweet, but besides that it is not much of a base.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"wakproductions","2009-07-25T18:39:13.92Z","Has its uses","I like how this base did not make use of the ramp and pit foundation.  The fighter-like scout ship hints that this could be used as sort of a strategic military coordination outpost.  The equipment inside of the rocks I guess could be used as turrets, but I often thought of it as sort of a fueling station for the larger ships in my fleet.  It would have been nice if they integrated this into the monorail base somehow to give more of a backstory.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LordDunsany","2020-11-20T16:21:19.347Z","The spacecraft can dock on top of the turret tower!","<p>I remember finding this set in a toy store long after Unitron had been discontinued but failing to impress the importance of acquiring such a rarity to my mother (I finally did manage to acquire a boxed version almost 15 years later).</p>

<p>It was the first space base since 6955 that did not use the raised ramp and pit baseplate.&nbsp; Like the other space bases in the early 90&#39;s, however, it has a somewhat open feel to it, taking up a relatively small footprint on the 32x32 baseplate.&nbsp; This openness does give you room to park the two vehicles included in the set.&nbsp; There is small ground vehicle with adjustable sensor/laser array that makes use of two unusual trans-dark blue panel pieces last seen in both Futuron bases.&nbsp; The spacecraft is consistent with similar (generally) interchangeable pods found in the other Unitron sets and is capable of fitting onto the monorail.&nbsp; I dislike the gaps under the canopy resulting from the use of slope pieces in most of the Unitron pods but otherwise am a fan of their sleek looks.</p>

<p>The spacecraft is also capable of sitting on top of the adjustable rotating sensor/laser turret tower in front corner of the base.&nbsp; In this striking configuration (sadly only visible only on the inside flap and some side images on the box), the structure can be viewed as a launch platform for the spacecraft or the spacecraft can act as the control center for the turret, a feature that improves playability.&nbsp; The top of the turret does have a seating area for a minifig with a single control tile under the raising canopy piece, but the canopy is positioned a tad too low for the seated minifig to be comfortable (the helmet is essentially pressed up against the closed canopy).&nbsp; The turret itself looks fairly impressive although I do wish that the angle of the webbed dish elements matched that of the top section.</p>

<p>The base also has a larger central section with steps leading up to raised platform with large transparent quarter dome topped with antennae at different heights.&nbsp; Two tower structures flank the quarter dome piece with one topped with a rotating, highly articulate &quot;zapper&quot; laser but the quarter dome looks oddly isolated unconnected to other elements.&nbsp; On the rather sparse platform is a single rotating and tilting chair with a computer slope positioned too low for the seated minifig.&nbsp; The two rear-facing lights at the back of the chair give the impression of small flyer craft.&nbsp; The entire raised platform is capable of rotating around and can be locked into place by raising two flanking BURP pieces.&nbsp; These rock elements can be lowered to reveal two rotating and tilting sensor/weapon array mini-towers not visible from the back corner of the base.&nbsp; There is also an additional small antenna communications structure that can be raised to reveal a computer tile underneath.</p>

<p>The set includes 3 Unitron minifigs but could use another to man all vehicles and stations (assuming the turret tower is not topped by the spacecraft).&nbsp; No mini-fig tool/weapon accessories are included.</p>

<p>As other reviews have noted, this set is bristling with moving sensors/weapons and thus provides a good standalone spy/defence base that also nicely augments the Unitron monorail.</p>

I only had a couple of Unitron sets as I came into the space scene very late in the mid 90s after most of the 2nd generation space themes were coming to an end, such as Blacktron&nbsp;II, etc.</p>
