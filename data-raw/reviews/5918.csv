"samuraiturtle","2009-11-11T05:34:38.78Z","Magnetic Forces","The real reason I got this set was for the ""Royal Guard"" (the red guy).  You could not get this guy in any cheap set.  ""Boba Fett"" and ""Princess Leia"" are just bonus to me.  The magnets are in side the mini-figure but do not worry you can still use them as regular figures.  Now if you wanted to you could take the heads off of ""Princess Leia"" and the ""Royal Guard"" and put on different heads on them.  Sadly ""Boba Fett's"" head is stuck on the body mainly because the helmet and jetpack are one peice.  Another down side is the figures do not come with any weapons.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Runkbolt12","2020-05-21T21:51:59.437Z","Good deal for the minifigs","<p>I got this set a while back when I was a kid. In my set all the&nbsp;figures were completely detachable and could be taken apart into all their respective pieces. I am also 90% sure my set came with a blaster for Boba and a black spear for the royal guard. I have heard and agree the figures possess a cheaper quality plastic, albeit they have received lots of wear from play over the years.</p>

<p>I definitely think this set was worth the buy at the time.</p>
