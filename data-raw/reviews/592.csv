"Novelty","2007-05-07T05:12:33.25Z","Wheels of Fire","The Egpytians/Romans seem to have inspired this chariot as it is one of the more historically correct chariot in the castle line.  Sadly it means that it's a few hundred years too early and obsolete for the general medieval castle time frame.  Still, it's solidly built and is stable, but it doesn't look great.  If anything, it seems like spare parts and a horse thrown together to create this set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

The building is easy, like the carts' building connecting with a horse. The detail of the horse looks like be from a dragon, and is because it that this is from dragon knights. The big axes are cool, included in many sets, compatible with many themes, like technic. The knight minifigure is great, but looks like very with the others of the same theme, liking be repeated. But, this is cool if you are searching for make an army. The minifigure also hangs a piece too included later on indiana jones' minifigure and a sword. This is a small set, and the rate is comparing with small sets, 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
