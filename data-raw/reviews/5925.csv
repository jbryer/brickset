The felt is designed to protect the wall surface against jangling keyrings, and the white plate is 16 x 4 studs. The keyrings are 2 x 4 blocks, with the keychain attached by a 2 cm screw that is visible in the back of the brick. This doesn't interfere much with the structure of the brick, so your keyring can be attached to more Lego in pretty much all the regular ways. 
The key ring blocks are red and light green. You can buy other colours from SAH.
The key rack is attached to a wall with four screws and rawl plugs. You will need an adult to drill the right size hole in a wall to take the plugs. You then screw the screws through the rack into the plugs. The key rack includes four white 2 x 2 round flat pieces with the usual technic axle holes. The instructions say the screw goes through them as well, but I think the piece would look better with these lego pieces glued on top of the screws to hide them. Alternatively you could pick four other round 2 x 2 pieces (cylinders, cones etc) out of your collection and use them.
In the end you have an unusual key rack that is part of your lego collection but more or less permanently attached to your wall. If you don't want to keep it on your wall, you could fix a stand to the back of it, or glue magnets on it and put it on a refrigerator. It will be quite heavy though (about 200g or 1/2 lb, plus keys) so it is probably best used as designed.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
