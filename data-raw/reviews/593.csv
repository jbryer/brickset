This includes a minifigure of a soldier and also some itens, like the barrel, the hat, two swords and the flag. The building of this set is easy and the design and color scheme are great. Like other minifigures of this theme, the minifigure included in this small set is nicely designed and is good due to it. The set have under all the platform, a small blue plate. Above, there are some black blocks that support the black plate that the other things stay. The cannon, included in the set is in a good position, under a white and yellow platform, and works very well. Above the platform, there is the flag, with the same building of other flags o old sets. Altough the set have no much playability and innovations, this is a good builted small set that have useful pieces like others of the theme, so, is a good option to increase sets with old small sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The small fort is perfect to your biggest pirate fort you have. The cannon is pretty cool too. 5 out of 5 for such a nice little set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
