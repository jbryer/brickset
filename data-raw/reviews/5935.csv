"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-07-21T06:16:37.437Z","A Half-Hearted effort","The news of a &quot;Horh Base&quot; thrilled many a Lego Star Wars fan. We were, of course, exxpecting rooms, a Tauntaun or two, and many other goodies. so it is quite unfortunate that this set is rather skimpy. The door doesn't even look like it will close properly. Anyway, the set seems to baost a decent number of valuable minifigs, so all is not lost. The turret also seems not badly done. Unfortunately, the Snowspeeder included is not the best version of the famed atmospheric craft. Adding to that, the probe droid doesn't quite seem menacing enough at all. Anyhow, this set should only be purchased should you have a stash of spare cash. I sincerely advise that you save up for the other offerings in the line this year.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-08-29T12:06:43.207Z","I actually buyed it for the pale C-3PO","<p>This set is minifig-focused. The K-3PO will make this set become a bestseller.<br />
<br />
PROS:<br />
<br />
- 2 rebel troopers, 2 repel pilots (Luke again...), 2 Snowtroopers, 1 white C-3PO (sorry, K-...). Total amount: 7. Plus a pro bot.<br />
- A snowy color scheme Snowspeeder, 95% similar to 4500.<br />
<br />
CONS:<br />
<br />
- again, more quality issues: fast plastic injection causes some irregular shapes, gummy plates with clip, some bley variations.<br />
- Way too many stickers, mainly on the Snowspeeder: I prefer 4500 because its bricks are printed, not covered with vinyl.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
If you want Hoth minifigs, go for it. Buy 10 ^_^<br />
If you want it for the Snowspeeder, go for the 4500.<br />
If you want it to play with, go for it.</p>

Due to lack of space, I haven't built it yet so I can't say too much about it.  However, the box does show some cool features about the set.  The minifigs are great!  No doubt about it.  The snowspeeder also looks good.  Also, the box shows that a guy can fit in the gun turret!  As you probably know, many people have been complaining that the base is just a door.  This kind of upset me also.  But hey, if you really want to, you can just add on to the base by yourself with your own bricks.  Overall, it looks great.

The blue/white rock pieces are a nice touch also. You get a really good set of mini-figs too 7 in total, with Snowtroopers available again for the first time in 3 years, and in cheaper set too. The probe droid is nicely made and fits in quite well. a couple off problems though, firstly the guns on the Snowspeeder are the older ones, and look out of place on the new design, but they can easily be modified. Also we get yet another Luke minifig, I've counted, I've got about 20 Luke minifigs (half off them are pilots). Wouldn'tbe so bad if he came in his Hoth outfit. I hope Lego continue the Hoth themes and give us some sets like it, ideal ones would be a Snowtrooper battle pack, a Hoth trooper battle pack, a Taun Taun partol with Wampa cave, and maybe a command centre.

"Ant","2007-11-07T13:04:30.92Z","The epitome of the sticker problem","The thing that really, really upset me about this set, is that stickers are used for the 2 computers (in the snowspeeder, and in the base).
TLC has always printed slope bricks when they're used as computers. One might forgive them for doing this for the computer in the base (I've never actually seen this one before). The computer in the snowspeeder though (a screen showing an AT-AT) has DEFINATELY been printed by TLC for both previous incarnations of the snowspeeder.
There are other pieces like this, the nose of the speeder, and another piece, which TLC also printed for the last version of the snowspeeder.

Barring this, the whole set feels like TLC just tried to use as many pieces as possible to up the piece count.

This set comes with two/three rooms. there is clearly the map room. Then there is the hanger, where the snowspeeder sits snug. The crane could either be counted as a repair room or part of the hanger, and it can take of a piece of the speeder to work on it. But what about the door? What room is that in? In SW 5, a rebal dude says: &quot;We'll have to close the doors,&quot; &quot;Do it.&quot; Leia says. Then, with a slight close-up to chewie, you see the doors close... the same as these doors. At first glanse, the doors look hard to close, but they fit farkky well and open/close at the turn of a dial. The turret is good, It fires, a troop an enter/exit it, and it is VERY cool!

"yodaccm","2008-11-18T23:48:59.983Z","Wonderful in it's simplicity","Man, there is just something about this set that I love.  I guess it reminds me of the old Castle sets from back in the day where the playset was just the castle front and the rest was left to your imagination.

 The Hoth Rebel base is basically just a set of huge blast doors that open and close.  Doesn't sound too great, but wait, there is more!  Beyond those blast doors are two little fold out sectionals, one a mini command center for your officers to plan out their escape from Imperial forces,  and the other is a cradle for the sweet snowspeeder that accompanies the set.  You can repair your snowspeeder with the repair platform and defend the base with the laser tower that actually shoots lasers!  (You'll see what I mean.)

The snowspeeder itself is a great design.  You can fit two figs inside with enough room for your trusty lightsaber, too.  It has the invaluable tow cable in the back for taking down those pesky AT-AT's  and two removable engines.  Also, it can actually fit through the blast doors, which is pretty important.

The best thing about this set are the great minifigs that come with it.  By itself, the set may not be worth the $50, but throw in 7 minifigs, and it's definitely worth it!  Comes with Pilot Luke, Dak (I think), K-3PO (exclusive fig), two Hoth troopers and two Hoth stormtroopers.  Also, it comes with a nifty little probe droid and E-web repeating blaster.  

The sky is the limit with this neat set.  Pair it up with your motorized AT-AT for the ultimate Hoth assualt.  Check it out!

"guybrush_threepwood2","2008-11-24T15:06:04.59Z","where do I start?","this lego set is just plain great. I always loved the battle of hoth. with a realistic turret, snow speeder, and main entrance, you can create a hoth battle of your own. the probe droid is very realistic and has a stand of its own
the snow speeder needs to have more orange on the wings\wing like things. the mechanism to open the front door is great, but, mine sometimes jams. yours may not  have that problem, but no guarantees. if you by this set and you don`t like the lasers (aka light saber blades), then put them inside the light blue painted pices on the front of the base and in front of one of the door halves. the bases is a simple build, as well as the snow speeder. 

now the snow speeder:
as i said, there isn`t alot of orange on the snow speeder, but I got over it.
the loading system is much better than 4500, and the engines  come of and are put on nicely. the minis are comfortably seated both front and back and luke`s light saber fits nicely next to him. the rear gun is better than all before it. the winch is nice and handy. the snow speeder is realistic to no end.

Finally, my dream came true yesterday. I found this set at a collectors shop and bought it for $35 dollars. I got to building immediately and was astonished by the snowspeeder the most. This is the best snowspeeder so far and is hands down the most sturdy. The base itself is niice and the circular shape of the door adds to the movie accuracy. It is really more of a hangar than a base, but nevertheless, it is very well built. The turret is also massive with a long barrel and a nice rounded shape. I'd also like to point out that this is one of the few non-xpod sets to use the canester covers. 
Minifigures: Here, we get another pilot Luke and another pathetic looking Dak. I really hope we get a new Dak in the Wampa Attack snowspeeder. We also get more snowtroopers and seriously one of the meanest looking turrets I've ever seen. More rebels are always nice, but I feel that they should have included one more to man the turret. Finally, on to the droids. The protocol droid is magnificant and has a great amount detail to it. The star of the set is the probot. I mean, this thing is awesome. It is larger than I expected and definately a keeper. 

Pros:
The figs are great, but Dak is truly a shame
The turret
The probot
The base itself

Cons:

For a ground base AND a limited edition set, the price is perfect at $50 for 548 pieces. There's obviously the base, two Rebel and Imperial cannons, a snowspeeder, and a repair crane for the snowspeeder. The minifigures are great, but in my own opinion, there should be figures of Wedge Antilles and Wes Janson minifigs (so if you had the Walking AT-AT you would have the pilots who did it) but this set also goes perfectly with 6212 X-wing (which has Wedge at least). Nonetheless, this set has rare and exclusive minifigs. Luke, Dack, 2 Rebel troops, 2 snowtroopers, K-3PO, and a Probe Droid are all must haves.

The Base itself, though more of a gate, is just excellent to play with. Two gears open the doors (you can also use your hands to get it opened) and the snowspeeder can just barely slide through the door but it nonetheless fits. I have to give this set the best remarks, because it fit everything I wanted.

Inside the door there is a landing platform for the snow speeder to land on and on the other side there is some tools and a screen of the battle ground. The snowspeeder is the best part of the set. It is very movie accurate and opens easily compared to past snow speeders. In the snowspeeder there is also a ledge where luke puts his light saber. The blaster turrent is okay. The fire-flick missles come out easily and don't work well. Overall the turrent looks nice on display though. Included in the hoth base is a small yellow crane. It helps hold up a part of a snow speeder to show it's inner workings (stickers). The probe droid is a bit over sized. It looks good and stands easy though so its not all bad.

 much better.&nbsp; This one seems a little too ""round"" at the top. As I said, my set didn't have the probe droid so I can't comment on that piece.&nbsp; <br></p><p>With many older sets, the price jumps up because of the minifigs.&nbsp; With this set, the minifigs are generally rather generic and don't include many ""main"" characters.&nbsp; This is good for army building but doesn't really enhance the value of the set.&nbsp; In particular, the Rebel soldiers are the ""old"" style (with the weird helmets) and I vastly prefer the new ones with the correctly-shaped helmets.&nbsp; You get two rebel pilots, which are fine for army building even if one is supposed to be ""Luke.""&nbsp; At this point I have so many Rebel pilot Lukes that they start to look like a generic pilot.&nbsp; Nothing rare there&nbsp; Extra snowtroopers are nice, of course (provided you are building a Hoth battle scene). The set also comes with a white protocol droid (K-3PO), which may or may not be rare -- I honestly don't know.&nbsp; I guess I would prefer this mix of figures -- even with out of date soldiers -- to more Chewies, 3POs, R2s, and the like.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><p>Pros<br></p>
<ul><li>The shield doors are a key design feature of the Hoth part of Empire Strikes back.<br></li><li>Snowspeeder is good for army/scene building<br></li><li>Fits well with the assorted other Hoth sets (Echo Base, Hoth Echo Base, Battle of Hoth, and Wampa Cave</li><li>Minifigs include pilots, troopers, and soldiers that are good for army building and don't duplicate ""main"" characters that you likely already have.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Other than a white protocol droid, no rare minifigs</li><li>Out of date rebel soldiers<br></li><li>Big bulky ""ice walls"" that look bad<br></li><li>Some issues with the sliding mechanism for the doors.</li><li>Out of date turret design<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall, I was content with my purchase.&nbsp; I would not have been happy if
 I had paid more for a complete set, much less one sealed in the box 
because it does not ""stand alone,"" has out of date minifigs and building
 design approaches, and is just too expensive on the secondary market 
for what it is.&nbsp; But the value for a used and opened set was worth it, 
given the set's relative scarcity and the relative importance of the 
shield doors to any Hoth battle scene.&nbsp; The set fills the gap among the 
other Hoth sets.&nbsp; Extra snowspeeders and turrets also add to 
scene-building, even if they are out of date compared to ""current"" 
designs.&nbsp; The minifigs are also useful for scene building, and further add to the playability, which is this set's real draw.&nbsp; Probably worth the hunt for a good deal on a used set.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,5,3
"Chills","2012-05-02T10:25:31.483Z","The shield-doors must be closed","<p>Being a huge fan of ESB and the Hoth battle I just had to have this set. I ended up getting it from Bricklink used and paid about twice the original RRP. That being said I'm pretty happy with my purchase. The set is really cool, has fun features and good playability.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: One of the iconic moments in Episode V was when the shield doors have to be closed while Luke and Han are stuck outside. That's what this set is, and it is well designed. The set brings you back to that moment, and you can feel the chill as the doors lock down for the night. Nice job, Lego, for the design. <br></li><li>Pro 2: The minifigures are great. You get Dak, Luke, a couple of snowtroopers and Hoth Rebel soldiers, and a 3PO unit. I like the old-school Lego face on Dak and the soldiers. Great additions to your collection</li><li>Pro 3: The snowspeeder is really cool. I like how the engines come off for ""repair."" Nice addition. Its also a solid ship that's swoosh-able.<br></li><li>Pro 4: Included in the set is a turret cannon, a probot, and what looks like an e-web gun. The turret is well done, kudos to Lego for this model. The probot is also pretty realistic. The e-web, not so much.</li><li>Pro 5: I like the yellow crane, too. It's similar, but not exactly the same, as the one in the Death Star (10188).<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: I am not too keen on the small ""command section"" on this set. It looks like an afterthought. I think Lego should have kept with the central ""hangar"" theme of the set and left the command center for another set (which they ended up making).<br></li><li>Con 2: The e-web gun isn't too realistic. Lego did a much better job with the one they included in the next main Hoth base, set 7879.</li><li>Con 3: The blast doors look incomplete. If you notice the parts that dove-tail together there are open studs. I think Lego should have put flat plates on these studs so the doors get a good ""seal"" with each other like in the movie.<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>I really dig this set, it's got great playability, cool features, and really creative. I also have set 7879 and the sets go together pretty well (with some imagination). If you're working to build your ultimate Hoth battle this is a must-have set.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"zipsforbananas","2012-08-28T09:55:24.763Z","What a genius idea for a playset!","<p>This is possibly Lego's best Star Wars playset in my opinion, there doesn't seem to be much to it, but what there is is so much fun! I'm gutted I was too late to buy it new as well, it was really good value for money, and it's not so easy to pick up cheap anymore as it's both good and quite rare.</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>Snowspeeder</b> that comes with the set isn't far off the Wampa Cave (8089) version, you can tell they're from the same stock. Because of that it's really good, and the height the computer screen is at is actually better in this version. I like that it's grey too, perhaps Lego knew they would be releasing another quite soon.</p><p>In terms of the 8089 version, the gun at the back isn't as good, but that's only one piece; the piece coming from the engine to the guns is quite poor, but again it's not a huge detail; and the engines actually lift off, which is simply different, not really better or worse. And I do really like the stickered detail under the engines and the crane and maintenance bay that come with the set. Again, it's a detail that makes it different enough to be worth having both.</p><p>There are a few details that I don't think this or 8089 got right, like the winch mechanism not being symmetrical, and there being no smooth runners on the underside and the posts that there are only being in the middle, but those aren't so hard to improve yourself if you want to. The figures sit lower in the ship in this version too - I customised the 8089 one quite heavily so that they weren't impeding the roof, so it wins on that point!</p><p>The <b>base </b>itself is quite minimalistic, but I think is the better for it. I'm not a fan of the amount of imagination that went into 7879, although the bacta tank is superb! I've said already, the cradle for the snowspeeder and the crane for lifting off the engines are really great; I like the maintenance features in the B-Wing and Home One sets, put them together and you've got a great hangar bay. The screen that folds out is wonderfully geeky, looking just like the display in the film. The main feature however is the doors, and they are great! The walls of snow around them are fun to build and look great, and the way they slide into place is just right. I found I needed to add some 1x2 tiles to plug the strange gaps where the doors meet, and if you slide them fully open you can sometimes lever the bottom brick off rather than sliding them closed, but those hardly detract from the overall effect.</p><p>The set does fall down on the <b>turret gun</b> and the <b>web gun</b>. They are both very crude looking, and have pretty pathetic missiles. But both have been updated in 7749, so if this is one set in a Hoth collection you don't really mind.</p><p>The <b>figures</b>&nbsp;feel like more of a booster pack too, but again that's no bad thing if this is part of a larger collection. Two more snowtroopers and rebel soldiers are always useful, even if the rebels are a little dated next to the newer battle pack versions. And I like having Dack Ralter, even if he's got a stock face (like Wedge Antilles. Shame.). K-3PO is a bit of a mystery to me as he looks a bit too washed out, but he does look at home in the&nbsp;Arctic-type setting, more droids are always good to have, and I suppose he was in the films (unlike the brashly red one in that new set that I don't think much of!).</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The hangar doors are brilliant and really make a Hoth scene complete</li><li>The snowspeeder is good, perhaps not as good as in 8089, but different and in some respects better</li><li>Nice details with the maitenance bay and tactical screen</li><li>A good set of figures to boost a Hoth battle scene</li><li>The sparseness is a pro if you want to create a hangar bay for all your ships - it can be as big as you like!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The two gun posts look dated and poor</li><li>On it's own the set seems a bit empty</li></ul>
<p>I do love this set, but I wonder if I didn't already own the Wampa Cave, the 7749 bunker, turret gun and Tauntaun and an AT-AT if I wouldn't have been a bit disappointed. You need to be able to fill the space to make it seem good. Perhaps not the best set to start a Hoth collection with, but as a booster set to an existing scene it is top drawer!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
