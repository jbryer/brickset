"Nased","2007-09-25T09:42:04.53Z","It's really close to perfect.","After owning the set for a few weeks, I have no regrets buying this set. It's awesome. Initially I couldn't understand why must the ship be bigger than the harbour. However, I think that is not a big issue. Come to think of it, all my pirate ships are bigger than any of the pirate base. Doesn't look good either. What matters more is the playability, cost, value in owning one set and many more.

This 7029 is really great. The theme itself isgreat, Land versus Sea. It is much better than the Knights Kingdom. There was one set from the Knights Kingdom which is something like a ship lanuching an assault on the Gateway. Anyway, the catapult works well, the skeletons are cool. I love the new weapons. Flails and Sickles. They look wicked and this set is truly a great addition to the entire series. Trust me, just get one of each and arrange them in whatever way you like. My set look absolutely cool in my house.

I love this set because the Wizard does not appear again in other sets. This pirate skeleton captain is exclusive to this set only and all the warriors have different facial expression. This Castle series is truly unique and a great masterpiece. I will give it a perfect 10 if there are less than ten sets in total. Not too many or else it will spoil it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-12-20T21:19:58.31Z","It grows on you","This set is limited edition and includes an &quot;exclusive skeleton pirate captain&quot;. I got it on sale for about $65 dollars. 
You start by building the little castle/port. The bags are numbered, 1 and 2 are for the castle, and 3 and 4 are for the ship. The castle consists of three main parts main tower with dock rock with catapult and a small room containing a table and some food. The fort is modular as in there are different arrangements or you can add it onto other castle07 sets so you can have one huge castle. 
The catapult works well and there is storage in the main part of the castle for the rocks. One thing that bothers me is the treasure placement but that is easily fixed. The main part of the port has to towers and looks good. Under the dock there is a small platform that when pulled back part of the dock collapses. The last room is also a nice addition as it offers a place for soldiers to rest and eat. 
When I first seen the skeleton ship I didn't like it much but after building it I'm starting to like it. The ship is made of two black Viking ship hulls. It also has some glow in the dark pieces on the ship. Since I didn't get any classical pirate ships I was glad when I found several &quot;pirate pieces&quot; like the steering wheel anchor and the captain’s hat. The little catapult on the front of the ship works well and is like the catapult featured in Crossbow attack. My only gripe is that there is no door into the captain’s room.
Over all this is a very good set with many good pieces like the barrel crate rat, frog, and Pirate pieces. No castle fan should be disappointed with this 5/5

"greenfrog_7","2008-05-09T02:12:59.14Z","Skeleton Ship... Attack!","This set was much larger than I expected, and was a very satisfying build. The fortress section is definitely a great addition to the Castle line and the number of figures included is satisfying. The ship is a bit awkwardly sized, but overall the set displays nicely and a number of fun features reveal themselves within the set that make it worth the price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-11-30T21:10:57.17Z","Can't do much nitpicking here...","This set really can't be criticized that much. It includes a good number of rare pieces, figures, and parts in general. The harbour is very well-built and fortified, and I like the trap on the dock. The ship, on the other hand... looks half-built, is too small for any real action, under-enforced, and the mast is right in the helmsman's face. But, like I said, there are a good number of rare pieces, including the frog, hat, anchor, steering wheel, and chicken leg.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"castleguy182101","2010-01-29T22:21:46.857Z","Awesome!","This set is totally awesome. It is a great set to add to your evil fleet (this and the Troll Warship) and you also get a Crownie place to attack, which is pretty nice, with a cool gate, a tower, a catapult, and a tavern area to the side with a cool roof and windows. I definitely recommend this set if you can get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2016-04-17T17:21:38.587Z","Skeleton Ship Attack; The Pirate Ship Ambush predecessor.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks :</strong> Another set in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Castle/subtheme-Fantasy-Era"">Fantasy Era subtheme</a> that in my opinion finds its origin in a Lord of the Rings scene. In fact a scene that was brought out in 2013 but without the harbour, namely <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79008-1/Pirate-Ship-Ambush"">The Pirate Ship Ambush</a>. That makes this set much better and more complete in my opinion. Another look-a-like set is the 2015 Ninjago set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70732-1/City-of-Stiix"">City of Stiix</a> which is also a great set. Because this set is <em>THE</em> original I like this one the best. All lot of sets of the Fantasy Era can in way be&nbsp;related to the LOTR theme thanks to the dwarfs, orcs and other fantasy figures. This set is a hard to find one but a great one to own for a Castle collector but also has a lot of playing features. If you get across one below the price of &euro;100,00 I would advise you to grab it, it is worth it and you will love it !!</p>

<p><strong>Building 4 bricks :</strong> Building this set is fun but not especially difficult or exciting so 4 bricks here. We start with the 2 side buildings, the first one is a kind of restroom where the soldiers can eat when not on watch. The second one is a hidden treasure room behind a rock with on the first floor a defense catapult. Then we get the center part with on the sites 2 green/grey rock parts and a hidden trap in the scaffolding. No drawbridge in the center but only a fence, the center part looks nice from the front but it is a bit of a disappointment that there is now real room to play in the towers. Then we get book 2 which gives the Skeleton ship, in fact it is compared to other bigger Pirate ships just a half ship.&nbsp;But it is designed very well, is strong, has a catapult and a command room with as best part the awesome Skeleton sail.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks :</strong> No real special parts in this set but still all very useful. An extra remark for the good number of 7 mini figures including the <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?M=cas346#T=P"">Skeleton Captain</a> and as best part the <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=sailbb40&amp;idColor=10#T=P&amp;C=10"">Skeleton ship&#39;s sail</a> !!</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks :</strong> Look at it : the two opposite factions with on the one side a ship and on the other side a good defendable Fortress with a load of weapons and 7 mini figures. Ready for action and hours of playing fun !!</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks :</strong> In 2007 the RRP was I think some &euro;75,00 which was a good price in those days and worth 5 bricks. The set wasn&#39;t available in regular toy shops I think so it became a hard to get set over the years. If you find it MISB it will cost you over &euro;245,00 and even used <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?S=7029-1#T=P"">Bricklink </a>offers an average of some &euro;130,00. If you are a collector it will maybe be worth it but if you want it just to play it is overpriced so I distract one brick here. If you can get it below a &euro;100,00 grab it and run because I think it will get worth more in the future !</p>
