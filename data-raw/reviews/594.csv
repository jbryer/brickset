I remember building many things with it, including snapping 2x4 bricks together to build a skyscraper, complete with a flag at the top. The set didn't come with any green 1x1 bricks, therefore, I always used the flower stems for the green light when building a traffic light. The wide variety of bricks allowed endless possibilities. Freestyle minifigures were also included. Many years later, my collection expanded, now all the parts are scattered in different piles. Most of the pieces are now too old and worn out to use.
