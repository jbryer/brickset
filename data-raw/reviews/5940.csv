What you get is a flip wallet containing a card with special agent and a place or your name and photo. On the other side is a gold, removable shield shaped badge with LEGO and a 2x2 brick on it. The wallet also has a neck strap so you can wear it like a detective and the neck strap clicks together using a LEGO pin in the clip.

Overall I think it is an awesome idea and a great thing for children who are real LEGO fans and love police. Its not a necessity to have in your collection but a great toy just the same due to the thinking behind it with the badge being removable the neck strap making it more realistic and everything being related to LEGO. I feel this model is a 6/10 or Above Average. This is one of those items I can't recommend or not as it really is up to the individual and you will need to make your own judgements on it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
