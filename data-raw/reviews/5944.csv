Are you kidding me? This set rocks!
Orange Muscle Car: Looks much better in person than on the package, built using great parts.

Blue Tiny Turbo: Just like its' red cousin from the Tuner Garage. One of the best Tiny Turbos out there. When I built the Tuner Garage I wanted to build this car in blue but didn't have the blue cheese slopes. Problem solved!

Police SUV: Thankfully it is not another police cruiser. I already have 2 from the Tuner Garage and the Tiny Turbo set. This SUV looks really great although I can't imagine a Hummer catching up to a muscle car.

Yellow Tiny Turbo: I love it. I can't wait to build similar cars to this model. 

The cars make buying the set worthwhile on their own.

Now onto the buildings.

The Gas station looks pretty cool and detailed. The filling pumps are simple yet fun to look at. There is a simple yet elegant design feature of using 1x plates (orange on top of black) that is striking. I was impressed with this design feature. If this was minifig scale these stripes along the building would have probably been made out of bricks rather than plates and the plates are an example of less is more.

The bridge absolutely blew me away! The way it rises up and down is just intelligently designed. The motorized function is a really cool addition to this set. The fact that the bridge is partially constructed using tan bricks is even cooler.

The slammer is similar to those included in the Tuner Garage and works but looks strange in a LEGO display.

Cons:
The ramps that lead up to the bridge are flimsy, thin and feel cheap. The stickers look ridiculously cool but WHY can't this detailed effect be accomplished by using printed parts? 

Thanks Lou and Mike! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
