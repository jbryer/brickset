Also, the whole of the roof + doors and back swing up.
The engine is just a model, no moving parts.
The Nitro tank inside is a nice addition.

The tyres are about the only cool thing about this set, they look so awesome and carry this set so much.

But in terms of everything else it is just an average set, nothing special.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Kyon_Pwns_You","2017-12-12T16:57:40.837Z","That one car that looks like a car on Street Outlaws","<p>It was about two years ago when I was in my sophomore year of high school, and I was rapidly expanding my inventory of Lego technic sets, I saw this set on sale on eBay for about $35 dollars with free shipping and was located in my state, and I was always interested in this particular set, due to it resembling the stereotypical street drag racing cars I saw on Street Outlaws; I decided I had to make the purchase.</p>

<h3>The Build and pieces</h3>

<p>The build was like mainly any mid-sized Lego Technic set in the $50-$80 dollar range, simple at most points of the build; consisting of pieces that could be seen in mainly any technic set, and generally, was a fun build that could be performed in a two hour sitting, At the time when I would build Technic sets, I would usually build them in increments each day, to savor the build; but due to my passion for cars, I wanted to build this amazing machine in one sitting.</p>

<p>Despite it was missing a wedged beam, as well as maybe one other unimportant piece, the build was still able to be performed without the two pieces. Another thing to note about the set was the two large rear tires which are exclusive to the set, which resembles&nbsp;most big tire streetcars from Street Outlaws, like the Crow or Murder Nova.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Despite the set is a technic set with the racers logo on it, it can make a great addition to any car lover&#39;s Lego car collection.</p>
