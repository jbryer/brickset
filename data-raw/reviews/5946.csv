There's a lot to like about the Tiny Turbos line; good price point and plenty of good parts for a quick, fun build, and hours of play. The only thing better than Tiny Turbo sets, are 4 or more Tiny Turbo sets combined into one! 8147 Bullet Run is a fantastic set with a wide range of great parts in a good selection of colours, with tons of play value for you and a buddy.<br><br>The set comprises a whopping SEVEN Tiny Turbos models; a heavy-duty tow-truck in red, a white fuel tanker, a blue heavy hauler loaded with flex tubes, a super-stretch white limo, a black and lime muscle car, a red exotic supercar and a large rally truck or buggy complete with flag on the back. Included in the set are TWO yellow slammers for propelling the cars into the trucks or over the pair of supplied ramps or over the supplied ramps INTO the trucks - it's good value all round.<br><br>The set also includes white bricks, dark grey plates and four smoke coloured windscreens that make up a toll gate with two booths. My only gripe with this is the vastly different scales between the toll booth and the trucks and cars - the booths are easily minifig scale whereas the Tiny Turbos sets are slightly smaller than fig scale. On the flipside though, this could well be a TLC descision to enable Town and City collectors to add fig scale toll gates to their layouts, with a plethora of useful small parts in a range of colours.<br><br>Overall, I couldn't really fault this set; just like the box art depicts, it is loads of fun and includes a heap of great parts. The price was maybe a bit high for my liking ($80 here in Australia so I picked mine up at 15% off) but I am not disappointed with the sum of the parts =). Heaps of stickers too, many over multiple bricks, but if you're not into stickers, the models look great without them too. <br><br>My favourites of the set are the limo and the muscle car, but the standout is easily the blue heavey hauler truck; the bed which holds the flex tube is suspended between the front and rear of the trailer, so it swings! Very cool and makes for great action when you slam the cars into the side! <br><br>If you're a fan of the Tiny Turbo line, you probably already have this on your list. If you're new to it, this is the perfect entry point with lots to offer.",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
"Legonater","2007-10-16T18:08:37.39Z","Perhaps My Last Tiny Turbo","I have really been into Tiny Turbos, as I have many sets. But as I bought them, more kept pouring in, and soon I seemed lost, unable to by everyset from even the first year. I have 'retaired' from the TT (Tiny Turbos) but this one, along with the bridge chase, look preatty good. These might be the last of the TT I buy. It looks awesome. It has many vehichles, and, from what I hear, a 'push off' area for racing. I can't wait to buy it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rifraphy","2008-12-27T23:27:05.343Z","Best lego set ever!!","I got this for my birthday from my mom, and when I saw it, I was so overwhelmed. I mean, look at all those Tiny Turbos! If Tiny Turbos didn't exist, Lego would be a passion to me. But with Tiny Turbos, it's an obsession! First of all, I would like to point out that this set has 7 cars, 2 slammers (push-off areas) and a great toll-station. (Captain Obvious). Here are the pros and cons:

:: A whoppin' 7 cars!
:: Great colors, very bright. 
:: Includes two slammers that work better than I thought. 
:: A surprisingly realistic toll-station!
:: The stickers were fun to put on - if not annoying at times. 
:: New designs! Lego puts serious TT effort into the multipacks. 
:: Playability: YEEHAW!
:: Great details. very realistic. 
:: Crunch into the tanker and the fuel will topple off. 
:: Smash into the logger and the logs (pipes) will fall off. 
:: Go through the toll-station and the barricade will fly off. 
:: They're very tough! I thought I'd break them with ^^, but no. 

;; The stickers are a pain to put on.... But it's worth it. 

Now onto a description of each car:

Racecar: Red-black, shiny, elegant, and it has flowy lines. Fave!
Musclecar: Lime-black, muscley, and fast. Second fave!  
Limo: White, elegant, long, uncluttered, shiny. Third fave!
Monster truck: Yellow-blue, tough, neat. Fourth fave!  
Fueler: White-orange-black, tough, big, sleek. Fifth fave!
Logger: Blue-gray, tough, abnormally huge, sleek. Sixth fave!
Wrecker: Red-gold, tough, huge, very functional. Seventh fave!

Overall, this is the coolest set I've ever achieved. All I can saw is wow. Tip: If you are going to buy this set, treat it like an advent calendar: Build a car a day!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The reason that I got it was that it possessed a toll building, which I used when&nbsp;I&nbsp;was building a city. There were lots and lots of cars too! The only problems were that the frontal&nbsp;stickers on the red racing car bend upwards, and that I think I&nbsp;received&nbsp;the wrong tubes for the blue truck. They were too short, and they always fall off. For some&nbsp;strange&nbsp;reason, the carriage with the oil tank (attached to the white truck) can bend in half thanks to a hinge brick. I don't know what that's for, but it just makes a crash look more realistic.</p><p>Overall, this set will be a great starter off set for someone who has decided to collect on Tiny Turbos cars. Get it, especially if you need a toll for your city!</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,3
"Boss_302","2014-03-04T20:36:43.637Z","The best set Racers ever made!","<p>The box is what got me from the start.&nbsp; I saw it at the store when I was like 6, and told my mom that I &quot;needed it&quot;.&nbsp; The lime green muscle car and the big rigs caught my eye.&nbsp; I got it for my birthday about a year later.</p>

<p>The parts are terrific.&nbsp; The slammers include plenty of Technic pieces, and the tow truck is a great example of a less is more, especially on the boom.&nbsp; I love the wreckable trucks!</p>

<p>No minifigs included, but the toll booth&#39;s windows can hold one.</p>

<p>Its been about 6 years since I got this set, but I remember it being fun.</p>

<p>Overall, its a handsome set, and you can arrange it many ways.&nbsp; The ramps are just thin plastic, and refuse to stay on a hard, flat surface(eg. a tabletop).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tiny Turbos is one of my favorite themes.&nbsp; This is easily the best set they made.&nbsp; My favorite car is the lime muscle car.&nbsp; I like how this set is placed in the desert, meaning its in America.&nbsp; Only thing that gets me is the price.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think this is worth $50.&nbsp; It should be $40.</p>

<p>P.S. I&#39;m new to Brickset, that&#39;s why you&#39;ve never heard of me, but I&#39;m on TV, so you can trust me.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"The_Brick_Guy_87","2017-06-17T08:30:05.827Z","The best Tiny Turbos set","<p>I got this set off Ebay&nbsp; in 2016 when I became a fan of Tiny Turbos again. Even though I don&#39;t own 8186, 8135 and 8154 yet, I think that this is the best Tiny Turbos set by far. Read to know why.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>There are 796 pieces in this set. There are a few rare parts like the tubes on the truck, the dark grey piece that holds the black part, on which the string is on for the tow truck, the pieces that make up the tank of the tanker and the ramps. There are also lots of colors (lime green, orange, blue, etc). Decent selection of parts overall.</p>

<h3><strong>Build</strong></h3>

<p>Takes about 2 hours and a half. Kids might need some help for the string of the tow truck. The build is a little bit repetitive, since the 3 trucks are very similar in design. There aren&#39;t much inspiring building techniques here.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>This set comes with 7 vehicles, a tollbooth, two slammers and two ramps. I will describe each component separately.</p>

<p><b>Limousine</b></p>

<p>Let&#39;s start off with this vehicle. The limo is white in color and has a wing as well as two horns as decorations. Due to its length, it doesn&#39;t turn very well, but it does the job. There are 2 skylights on the roof. Well built car overall.</p>

<p><strong>Sports car</strong></p>

<p>It is red and similar in design to the 8662 Blue Renegade. There is a black stripe going through the car. It has a racing number 42 on one mudguard and the sides. On the &nbsp;spoiler there is a decal which says &quot;Bullet Run&quot; which is also seen on the other 3 racers as well. I guess Bullet Run is a race competition which takes place around the whole USA or something and these cars are taking place in it. My favorite vehicle in the set.</p>

<p><strong>Muscle car</strong></p>

<p>Lime green in color. Has two golden stripes running through it. I liked how they made the rear set of wheels higher than the set at the front. It has a racing number 28 on the hood. It also has &quot;V8&quot; stickers on the side suggesting what the engine is supposed to be. There are also some exhaust stickers at the rear. Pretty nice car.</p>

<p><strong>Off-roader</strong></p>

<p>It has a color scheme of yellow and blue. It has more basic build in comparison to the previous vehicles. There is a chrome engine on the hood and a flag with a racing number 33. There is a bar at the rear and front as well. Like the muscle car, the front end is lower than the rear. I think it could have had more detail, though it is not bad overall.</p>

<p><strong>Tow truck</strong></p>

<p>This one is kind of obvious. How do Tiny Turbos get to a repair garage when they are wrecked? With this thing of course! It is red and has similar design to the 8664 Road Hero. There are chrome exhaust pipes. Clever use of binoculars as horns and car doors as doors for storage places. The front and rear bumpers are yellow 1x4 flat tiles with black printing on them. A Bionicle&nbsp;hook is used to hold cars at the rear. A well-detailed vehicle with some functions as well.</p>

<p><strong>Tanker</strong></p>

<p>Like the tow truck, the truck is very similar in design to the Road Hero. It is white and has an orange and black stripe running through it. It has stickers reading &quot;Fuel 4 Speed&quot;. There is a license plate reading &quot;F4 5P33D&quot; There is a rotating 2x2, which connects the truck to the trailer. The trailer has the same license plate as the truck and there also 4 stickers reading &quot;Flammable Liquid&quot;. It has a hidden function-it can break in half, meaning this is a great possibility for crashes. A good vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Hauler</strong></p>

<p>Again, truck is similar in design to 8664. It has a color scheme of grey and blue. On the sides and rear there are stickers reading &quot;Phoenix Club&quot;. There is a license plate reading &quot;TR 38813&quot;. &nbsp;Again, a rotating 2x2 connects the truck with the trailer. This trailer has a function as well- it can spill the tubes that are being hauled, if a car crashes into it. There are stickers reading &quot;Wide Load&quot;. There also stickers on the side reading &quot;Warning! Long&nbsp;Vehicle&quot;. And they aren&#39;t kidding- the trailer alone is long 28 studs! All in all, another good truck.</p>

<p><strong>Ramps and slammers</strong></p>

<p>The&nbsp;slammers are very similar to the ones in the 8681 Tuner Garage, but these are yellow and black. There&nbsp;are also stickers on the sides reading &quot;Slammers. Rubber band is used so the slammer raises up immediately after it is pushed down. The ramps to me don&#39;t really feel like LEGO, they can not even attach to plates! Nevertheless, they get the job done well to make the cars fly and crash into the trucks.</p>

<p><strong>Toll station</strong></p>

<p>Now this is the reason non-Tiny Turbos fans may buy this set. The toll station is perfect for any City as it can fit &nbsp;minifigs inside. There are stickers showing routes, speed limit and where to go through the toll. Very good and useful component of the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Boy, was this a long review! But if there are so many components, what do you expect? Overall, this set is a must-have for Tiny Turbos fans, although I recommend it &nbsp;to City builders&nbsp;as well because of the useful toll station. I&nbsp;apologise for any grammatical mistakes and if you find my review unhelpful, please contact me to give me some advice to make better reviews.&nbsp;Goodbye!</p>
