All of the letter tiles (A-Z with others) are printed and you get about 60 of them. Also included are 4 Metallic Silver 1x1 round plates and 4 Metallic Silver 1x2 plates with grills. Metallic Silver! These are a great bonus in my mind. I have never been happier with a 98 cent set before. I have used the letters to make signs for a book store that I built and posted pics on my brickshelf gallery.
