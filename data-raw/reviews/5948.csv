"AddictedToStyrene","2007-11-03T07:55:39.53Z","Rare droid on a key chain","This is a nice little key chain/figure. The key chain has an evil, black Astromech Droid, only found in the Star Destroyer playset, as far as I know. Also attached is a 2x2 tile with a round end and a hole, printed with the Lego logo. Both are firmly attached to the keyring, and it would take some effort to remove them. Why would you want to? Well it's Lego - there's always another use for it - and it's a much cheaper way to get this almost unique droid.
As a keyring, it might still be a bit fragile - I think being banged around in your pocket with keys would eventually scratch it up and remove the painted details. So, I like this set, and I recommend it for the collector, but for display or modification, not for joining your carkeys and nailclippers.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"GreatBear","2008-05-19T15:01:22.7Z","This is the Droid You're looking for...","I agree this is a good value if you want an R2 without buying a major set. Unlike some of the other keyring figures you can take with one apart somewhat. The legs are removable - and this is the only way I know to get Astromech legs separately - bodies and domes you can get from Shop@home.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
