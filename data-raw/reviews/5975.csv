"SJPlego","2007-07-31T21:36:44.723Z","Jailer of the Pit","At first, I admit that Hydraxon didn't catch my attention.  After reading a bit on his story, though, I became interested and bought him.  I have yet to regret doing so.

THE BOX
On the front, Hydraxon is posed, seeming to be &quot;running&quot; underwater.  He is looking up at something to the upper left (something not on the box), and is firing at whatever he happens to be looking at with his blaster.  It's a good pose, catching the attention of consumers.
The back shows him in a different pose, the one seen here.  This mirrors the pose that is found on the back of Dekar's box, a possible reference to their connection in the story.  Also shown are pictures of Voya Nui, Mahri Nui, the Cordak Blaster, his back blades, close-ups on his hands, and the two other main titans of this year.  Having a very underwater feel to it, the box art makes the box art of last year seem a bit... boring.

THE PIECES
This set includes 165 elements mainly in black and silver.  Most notable of them are the following:
 - Hydraxon's face.  Similar to a Kiril in design, this might be yet another reference to the relation between Dekar and Hydraxon.
 - Tubes.  This set has four wide tubes and two narrow tubes.  In appearances, they are cool, but be careful that the narrow tubes don't bend in ways you don't want them to.
 - The various blades in the set.  Included are two Mahritoran blades (another reference?) and a silver Shark Tooth Blade.
 - Cordak Blaster.  With just a bit of mastering, this can be a very cool projectile-launching part.
For MOCers, this is a very good supply of parts.  For people like me, this is a supply of parts for building a black and silver titan.

BUILDING
The building goes in the following order:
 - Body and Head
 - Feet
 - Right arm
 - Left arm
It is pretty straight-foward, and easy to follow.  However, several parts, such as connecting the wide tubes to the +/o and o/o parts, are just a pain in the neck... erm, fingers.

PLAYING
Hydraxon is very fun to play with.  He has tons of points of articulation, including fingers that are not oversized like Axonn's.  All his blades are easy to deattach, so he can throw them at the Barraki and Toa Mahri.  The Cordak Blaster is pretty neat.  Although I'm not too fond of it - after all, it is a giant gattling gun, and I never like those - it seems perfect on Hydraxon, and is easy to fire.
In any case, Hydraxon is a pretty good set, among the best sets of this year for BIONICLE.  If you're someone who likes either him or his parts, go get him!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2008-02-24T14:44:10Z","Almost a 5","The key to Hydraxon is the box he comes in. He's in a super cool pose, huge claw visible while he's floating the water, looking up at the enemy, and shooting him with the Cordak blaster. The finger design is visible, and the whole thing is just so visually appealing. 

There are a few things noticed when you dump the pieces out. Theres the mask, which isn't actually a mask, but a face (it's still possible to use as a mask). There's the Cordak blaster, and there's a tri + rod, an interesting piece I hadn't seen before. Most of the other pieces are old and have been seen/used before on previous sets, so thing truly special about them. 

The build also isn't too spectacular. Harder than building canister sets, but if you've built any of the box sets from '05 or up, it's not necessarily any different. The pipes you see behind the Piraka foot on the front of the chest can be difficult to place, but it's otherwise like any other box set. 

Where the set looses points is when it comes to posing the set. The heavy Cordak blaster weighs the arm down a bit, and it makes it worse when the elbow joint is loose in the first place, which mine seems to be. The fingers, while they look greatly designed in the picture, have problems on the actual set. Some of the fingers have pretty loose connections, and they don't necessarily like to stay in place. This is a parts issue, so some sets may have better connections than others. The claw is also really big, and kind of awkward to pose, but it works (I actually find that the Matoro claw, and Nuparu foot limit the rotation and posability of the arms). Lastly, there are tubes that connect from Hydraxon's mask to the back of his torso. This stick out an inch or so, and can be visually unpleasing. I've since gotten used to it, but some people may not like it. 

One posing aspect that is great are the legs. The piston supports allow Hydraxon to have different poses, without having to worry about him falling over (quite unlike the '05 Titans, the '04 Dume and Nivawk set).

Overall, Hydraxon is a pretty decent set. A few posing issues mainly with his arms, but an otherwise good set. If you've got money, and are wanting to add another '07 set to your collection before they all disappear, Hydraxon isn't a bad set to look to. A 4 out of 5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"DarkLordMakuta","2007-09-12T11:28:20.827Z","Hydraxon","Well, it's a set. That's pretty much it. Although cool, he doesn't really bring anything new to the table, and he doesn't have a lot of parts.

Pros:
- Cool hands
- Well-balanced (except the Cordak arm, it tends to flop around)
- Blades out the wazzoo

Cons:
- Hands aren't very sturdy
- Rather uncreative design
- Cordak blaster is too heavy",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Pulsar","2007-12-27T20:18:01.06Z","Very Cool!","Hydraxon is an awesome set. I like his tools and his mask/helmet. He  powerful looking but he has some downfalls.

[Pros:] 
-Ears!
-Blades everywhere!
-Cool helmet.
-Very aquatic looking.
-Fingers which fit his porportions(unlike Axonn).
-Cordak blaster rules!
-Awesome MOCing peices.

[Cons:]
-Feet have uneven amount of cordak missles on them. Lego could have added a fourth.
-Body looks a little strange because the chestplate leaves some holes uncovered and needs too 3-stud pegs (with no covering)too keep it from looking bad.

"Gus_263","2008-03-07T12:04:31.903Z","Good, but gadunka is better","Great warrior,contain 165 pieces, not much than some titans, but include new features. He have a rahkshi leg and piraka feet, isn't very tall than brutaka and stronger than axonn or gadunka. The inika feet are used as armor, it looks like cool. One silver piraka foot is his central armor, and another silver on body are the kalmah's armors. He have too some weapons, the boomerangs, blades on back, cordak blaster, and blades on the left arm. His hands are different, liking more real, and have little spikes to like a claw. But these can't carry weapons. This is a innovation, but no very a feature, gadunka is better because is very different to a warrior or titan. The mask isn't a  mask in the storyline, but it is his face. A great option for 07' underwater figures. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-05-13T15:04:37.997Z","Jailer of the Pit!","I got Hydraxon on Christmas '07 and thought he was very cool for Fifteen quid. In the storyline, Hydraxon was a member of the Order Of Mata Nui and was assigned to guard the Pit along with Botar. However, a gigantic earthquake called the Great Catacalism occured, shattering the Barraki's cells and injuring Hydraxon, which Takadox killed. However, the Kanohi Ignika transformed Dekar into an exact copy of Hydraxon which had both Hydraxon's and Dekar's memories.

Anyway...

Pros:
Hevily armoured
Cordak Blaster
Back Blades
Wrist Blades
Exploding Boomerangs (sadly do not explode or fly back to you in real life)
Stands upright very well

Cons:
Big rubber pipes sticking out of his back which bend if you lay him down on his back
Cordak Blaster doesn't fire very well
The big poles sticking out of his legs look wierd

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-29T05:03:37.617Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Warriors) - Hydraxon Review","This is a great set and fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well. The arms, the claws, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved. One arm has a nice looking gun with some flick-missiles. The only problem with this gun is that it doesn't shoot really well. But I still like the design of this figure. I also like the colors which LEGO has chosen for this figure. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms

"james3426","2009-10-28T21:03:22.2Z","""Welcome to the pit, runner.""","This guy has so many weapons! He has: Exploding Boomerangs, Wrist and Back Blades, claws, and a Cordak Blaster (Names from the story). I like his mask/helmet (At first, I thought it was his face, untill I saw http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Hydraxon's_Tale.) He has a very complex design, although his legs are lately being cloned (ex. Tuma, Icarax). The middle wrist blade is my first ""air sword"" (From Lessovikk) and it is one of my favorite blades! I love the rubbery ends of the blade! He is very pose-able due to the back blades and claws.

pros:
Many weapons.
Very pose-abble.
""Air Sword'
Claws are move-able.
Cool helmet.

cons:
Drops cordak blaster easily.

A great titan with many interesting pieces. I highly recommend him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KodakKid365","2010-11-17T17:55:41.78Z","Pretty darn cool!","Hydraxon is very cool. He is big and has cool designs and parts. His gun is a good shooter but you have to make sure you press it hard. If you don't, it probably won't shoot. The hands are awesome, the way the claws work. The rest of the parts are cool. If you like bionicles then you should get this set.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"PaulTR","2010-12-08T19:51:37.49Z","One of the Best Bionicles Ever!","<p>I first saw this set&nbsp;on LEGO.com, and my mouth hit the floor when I saw it. I couldn't believe how cool Hydraxon looked, and I was&nbsp;determined to save up enough money to buy&nbsp;him. Fortunately, my parents got me&nbsp;this set for Christmas in 2007. I was hoping Hydraxon would be&nbsp;a tall, strong,&nbsp;brute of a&nbsp;Bionicle.&nbsp;After building it, I was not disapointed in the least!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, Hydraxon is one cool looking dude. With his silver knives, hands, armor, and mask, Hydraxon evokes a menace that few Bionicle sets can match.&nbsp;I think Hydraxon's&nbsp;gives off a very cool ""underwater bad-guy-jailer/hunter""&nbsp;vibe, if you can get my drift ;) This is examplified by his&nbsp;wrist knives, mean looking mask, and Cordak blaster.&nbsp;He's also a very tall set, measuring in at 9 inches.&nbsp;My only complaint with his looks are several blue axel/rod pieces that ruin&nbsp;his color scheme; I don't know why the designers&nbsp;didn't substitute some gray pieces instead. Overall, Hydraxon is a great looking set, and is&nbsp;one of the sweetest looking&nbsp;things to come out of the 2007 Bionicle year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hydraxon was a challenging and fun build.&nbsp;His&nbsp;chest&nbsp;is cleverly constructed from a silver Piraka foot, coupled with gray tubes emerging from his back.&nbsp;His legs are strongly constructed with&nbsp;ball and socket supporters, and re-inforced with&nbsp;socket pieces containing, strangly, shock absorbing rubber between them. His fingers are constructed out of Exo-Force&nbsp;Robot arms, and his fingers are constructed of grey talons.&nbsp;Overall, he was a&nbsp;fun and challenging set&nbsp;to build, and really refreshed me after building so many mediocre Bionicle sets. The pieces themselves are&nbsp;excellent and useful.&nbsp;MOCers will&nbsp;rejoice over the abundance of grey armor pieces, and the utility of all the knives, including a&nbsp;slick Pridak blade in grey.&nbsp;However, while most of the&nbsp;pieces are great, there are no completely ne wpieces besides his mask. Also, the box shows the Cordak blaster with a glossy, silver sheen on it; however, the Cordak blaster is just like the Mahri's, with a silver front plate and a dark grey back:(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hydraxon is a joy to&nbsp;play and pose&nbsp;with.&nbsp;I personally love to pit him against my Barraki collection, making him ambush them with his easily detached head-knives. His Cordak blaster&nbsp;can also&nbsp;be fired,&nbsp;and be used to bring down runners.&nbsp;However, while Hydraxon is fun to play with, he does not include any action&nbsp;feature besides his&nbsp;Cordak blaster;&nbsp;I don't mind launchers, but the Cordak blaster is&nbsp;hard to shoot.&nbsp;It looks like it fits into the underwater universe of the Pit, but&nbsp;I have to take points off for its difficulty of use. However,&nbsp;Hydraxon is no slouch&nbsp;in the poseablity department:&nbsp;with over 20 points of articulation, Hydraxon is extremly poseable. You can make&nbsp;him&nbsp;run, swing his arms, and menacingly glare down at other Bionicle figures.&nbsp;As a bonus, Hydraxon is incredibly sturdy, and won't fall apart easily.&nbsp;And at&nbsp;165 pieces for $20 US dollars, he is&nbsp;well-priced for a Bionicle set.&nbsp;But enough&nbsp;talk!&nbsp;On to the pros and cons!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Beastly looks 
<li>-Fun build 
<li>-Great&nbsp;weapon pieces 
<li>-Poseable 
<li>-Good piece-to-price ratio (for a Bionicle)</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-No new pieces 
<li>-Cordak blaster is tricky to fire 
<li>-No&nbsp;gear features&nbsp; 
<li>-Those annoying blue axel/rods!</li></ul>
<p>The bottom line? Pick Hydraxon up as fast as you can! With great weapons, poseability, and that venomous mask of his, you can't miss out on what may be one of the best Bionicle sets of all time!</p>
