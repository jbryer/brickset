"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-07-31T21:46:07.957Z","Once again...","Once again I am the first to review this set! Gadunka is an okay set. I HATE how the neck is connected! All it is are two Toa Inika legs with no armor! I love how the Skull glows in the dark! The only problem is, how did gadunka get a Squid shooter? They were made for barraki only! Any way the teeth are awesome! I love the blades as fingers! Overall a nice set to get!

Pros:
- Unique
- Cool teeth
- Cool claws

Cons:
- Hard to pose
- Unexciting arm design
- Squid launcher",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Nate_Wan","2007-12-13T14:24:22.827Z","Finally a known Giant Toa Titan!","This set is great and is the most unique Titan since Nidiki.
Pros:
Original
Great mouth that can bight my Axon in half
Nice Claws
Great posibility you can make him half the size of a Toa and the change him to make him taller then Hydraxxon

Cons:
Why silver piraka feet?
His arms are pretty much just thrown on there
The leg armor falls off alot

This is probally one of the best Titan this year and is worth the $20 you pay for him",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-04T14:57:08.81Z","Monster from the deeps","I only have this warrior for now, and this is one of my favorties of the year. Gadunka like all new, with old pieces but used in a new form. The new piece is the skull, that glows in the dark. Without it gadunka can't have a good head. The spines are used as teeth, and the claws on hand are awesome, very playable and cool. It is small, to have a toa size, but it can turns in a titan size too. One of the cons is the squid launcher, why it if have cordak or sphere launcher ? And of the pro, lots, like the poseable head, legs, arms and mouth (this have a red piraka foot claw like); the colors (blue schemes with black and silver is great); the glow in the dark piece and size.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Claws

cons:
Squid launcher doesn't fire
Rubbery teeth

I think this set is a bit disappointing, with the squid launcher 3/5",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-14T17:20:15.357Z","GADUNKA!","Gadunka is a really great Bionicle. His head is glow in the dark and his teeth are the Ehlek spine pieces. His claws are the Mahri Matoran blades and look really great.

Pros:

Glow in the dark head
Ehlek spines used as teeth
Claws
Cool build
Suspension on legs
Hakann foot used as tongue
Leg armour
Chest armour
Highly posable

Cons:

Squid launcher sucks

Other than that squid launcher con, which is easily fixable, Gadunka is one of thee best Bionicles ever made.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"knuclear200x","2009-04-13T18:53:46.827Z","One Freakin' Frog","TRU had a few previous generation big bionicles left on the shelves, and at a price I can easily accept (and a free bucket with a 30 dollar purchase promo they had as well). I was able to pick this up days before they ran out of them, too.

Pros:

Well let's see...it's a big one, but not as tall as Maxilos, in its initial pose anyway. It has three-pronged claws, a menacing appearance, a glow in the dark mask and a mouth that opens wide. However these are all the pros I can think of. 

Cons:
Despite its design, it suffers a lot of poseability limits. We'll start with the neck, it's connected by the two wrench pieces to support that big head of his. The problem with this, it can only swivel its neck side to side but you can't turn its head. As for the articulation between the neck and the head, the piece has this obstruction that keeps the neck from bending to a point to where you want it. 

Then there are the legs, like with a lot of the other giant sets, they are supported by this train piston so that it can support the weight of the whole figure to avoid inconvenient leg-bending. Too much posing in that area may cause the piston to disconnect at times. 

The feet appear to be a terrible choice by the creators. They're too small. With something so big, you'd think they'd put bigger and more supportive feet. As for the claws, only two of its fingers are poseable. 

And the arms also suffer from poseability limits. You can't really turn them the way you want since the ball joints would be built diagonally.

Other things worth mentioning are the teeth. The pieces used for the teeth are also used as a spiked bumper for certain vehicles like that one in the recent Castle line. They're rubbery, and don't connect when they close. Also, the monster's tongue is a talon. Probably not the best idea for a tongue but it works in some levels.

Probably an even worse idea, is giving the monster frog the small squid launcher. It doesn't really need one with its immense strength. The launcher isn't even that great and hard to use so its best to remove it and give it someone else.

Conclusion:
Despite all the flaws I mentioned, this is a toy worth having. Just replace the feet with something better, if any, and the toy still gets points for being an awesome looking, Mutated Frog-beast with teeth. And it still has a few poseability options that you may be happy with, but not that much.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-10-14T13:21:31.593Z","Gadunka","I got this for Christmas in 2007.
Story info: Gadunka are tiny, harmless Rahi. But this is a Gadunka grown to massive size by the Ignika. It battled the Toa Mahri twice, then got shrunk again. That's it.

Pros:
Opening jaws
Claws
Glow-in-the-dark head

Cons:
The Squid Launcher doesn't work well and it's rubbery
Rubber teeth

Overall, 4/5

</p><h4>Parts</h4>This set has some nice and interesting pieces. Some
 of them are rubbery and one of them glows in the dark. We also get some
 great looking teeth. These pieces are great for future MOC's (My own 
creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br></p>

There's also a nice looking launcher but the only problem with that weapon is that it doesn't shoot really well. I really like the design of this figure. I think it makes him looking very cool and scary.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Squidtron","2009-12-21T21:24:45.45Z","YOUCH!! Bionicles aren't suposed to bite!","This set is totally chompy, and awesome. He can bite through anything(not really) and crunch things to bits with his claws(same as last time).

Now onto the Cool/Not Cool things.
Chomper(YOW he bit me again)(+3)
Big(+2)
Squid Launcher(+1)
Glows in the Dark(+1)
You can stuff the squid down his ""throat"" then it falls into a sort of ""belly"" and then can be pulled out of a hole on his underside (yum! :9)(+2)
Only 4/6 of his ""fingers"" can move(-1)
Kind of an empty hole for a nose(-1)
To expenxive(-2)

So then his total is...5/5
A must buy for any Bionicle collector.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
