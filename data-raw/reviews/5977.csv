"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-07-31T21:42:54.49Z","LOVE HIM!","Once again I am the first to review this set! The first thing you might notice is Spinax the energy hound. I love him! His mask is new to! All you bionicle collecters out there should love that! I also like Maxilos. The shoulder mounted Cordak Blaster is awesome! I love how the lego company used Fenrakk mask's for the Shoulder Armor! (Another thing you bionicle collecters might like!) Maxilos is tall! He's as tall as Brutaka! A must have for any bionicle fan!

"dy_enforcer","2007-11-24T23:52:27.14Z","The Guardian Robot of the pit and his Energy Hound","Ok I split this into two reviews so that I can do it one at a time.

Spinax:

This energy hound is a good design of a dog.His four claws,spines at the back and his head are all shiny silver,well almost.Also is red eyes really makes him the vicious hound ever.

Maxilos:(AKA Makuta)

Is this really the guardian robot of the pit? Wow,he is really tall,isn't he? Maxilos has some great designs.The first one is that his armour is metallic.He has some nice foot design and his weapon a Twin Blade Black Fire Sword.His metallic armor is made of Toa metru feet for the leg armor,Toa hordika(webbed)feet for the chest armor and finally two Vezon's mask for the shoulder armor,Yup,you heard it Two Vezon's mask.This mask really shocks me a lot.His sword is like a spear although the long 12 inch axe piece is quite short,so it really is a sword.What I don't like about Maxilos is the stomach joint piece.Its really annoying to balance and can be a bit disappointing.The mask however is really cool.I don't know what kind of mask is this but this mask really is the best for me,I mean look it has two barraki blue eyes on the right side of the mask don't you think its pretty cool to see it.And the shoulder mounted cordak blaster well it does not suit him well,but if you look at the color of the big button at the back,its the same color as the body of Maxilos.Welcome back red bionicle pieces.The chain that holds Spinax is actually short,LEGO should at least make it a bit longer.Well I'm done with my review,here are the results.

Pros:

Spinax:
-Lots of shiny silver parts
-red eyes makes Spinax the most vicious dog ever

Maxilos:
-Great metallic armor design
-Vezon's mask in the shoulder armor
-The return of the red bionicle pieces
-Cordak blaster button suits the color
-So does the mask

Cons:

Spinax:
-The tail is too short

Maxilos:
-Sword is almost like a spear
-The stomach joint piece
-The chain that holds spinax is very short
-shoulder mounted cordak blaster is a bit of a drag

Overall: 5(10/10)This is a best two-on-one set.A must buy for all bionicle fans out there",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Pulsar","2007-11-25T08:08:30.53Z","Totally Makuta!","This set is awesome! The colors are good and the posability is amazing-17 points of articulation! His weapon is fairly big and looks very powerful. His Shoulders are very armored and robotic looking too. Spinax loooks very menacing also!

"Nattyd31","2008-01-10T19:18:43.64Z","Best of 0'7","this set is so cool! there is so much to like here. spinax has cool spikes,and head but is kind of boring. maxilos has a waist joint, awsome parts, like gun metal grey vezon masks, cool weapons, and much more! It is so worth the money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Imperial13","2008-06-08T14:42:40.747Z"," A little over rated."," This is one of the hundreds of sets in the highly popular Bionicle series. Sadly, this theme has been infected with things that shoot and cheap looking flame swords. The Shooter is hard to shoot, it is much larger than some other &quot;classic&quot; sets! The downer of this set for me is pretty much Maxilos. To much junk on his body, mostly weapons. Spinax! I love this cute little beast who looks like he could rip anything off anyone, which is a great look to maintain. finally, why does spinax need a chain, since you would think as they are packaged with each other they would have telepathic links or something along those lines.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"pirate_mason","2009-01-09T23:13:35.997Z","One word: Tall!","this is a great titan set. First of all, Maxilos is NOT 8 inches tall. He is more like 11 in reality, easily towering over any toa he may want to crush under his heel. His sword/axe weapon is nice and quite large and deadly looking. The cordak launcher, like all cordak launchers, refuses to fire very much. Also it is located in a bad area on his body. The mask..it looks like the original Tahu's mask.. Hmmm... Well, Spinax looks like a dog you wouldn't really want to pet. while his spikes and pieces are good, the chain is nowhere hear long enough.

For $30 i really recommend this set. It is very very good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T13:53:05.2Z","Teridax 07' Form","The latest set of the main villain of bionicle, Teridax or &quot;the Makuta&quot;. This is a good set that looks like his first set because the colors, like the gray and red and silver parts. In this titan set he is  a robot with his energy hound, spinax. Maxilos is the robot's name, have great additions, like the playability in the arms and in the legs. The weapon is made with some blades too included in the toa mahri, and he have too a cordak blaster. One great thing is that some of his armors were used different in another pieces, like the vezon's masks on the arm. His feet are large, different to some titans. The Spinax is too playable, and have cool gray and silver. His mouth can moves and he have pieces that looks like spines. They are connected by a chain. I rate this titan set 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lego12","2008-03-16T12:02:13.543Z","This is HUGE!!"," I got this set on sale at Target for $20.00 instead of $30.00!

                   - Maxilos is really tall
                   - Spinax is bigger than I expected
                   - Really cool body Armour
                   - Fun and a challenge to build unlike any other Bioncle
                   - Mask is SWEET!!
                   - CHEAP!!

                  
                   Cons:
                   - Cordak blaster doesn't shoot very well
                   - Hard to pose
                   - Leash is way to short

"jrathage","2008-06-04T00:11:43.187Z","A great homage","One of my favorite aspects of Maxilos is his resemblance to the 2003 Makuta. The gunmetal armor, giant shoulders, dual-bladed sword, big claws, and color scheme all pay homage to the original incarnation of BIONICLE's biggest, baddest villain. He even looks fantastic wearing the Krahkaan, for those of you who've been around long enough to own a Mask of Shadows.
Plus this time around, he's back with an incredibly articulate form with an amazing 18 points of articulation (Double that of the 2003 set!), including waist and shoulder motion. The only way that it is inferior to the 2003 set is his weak hip joints, which pose some minor difficulties when posing.
The set is huge, easily the tallest BIONICLE yet. Including his Cordak, he's more than twice as tall as a Toa Mata. Plus he comes with an agressive-looking, very silvery robot dog. Easily worth the price tag.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"irnakk4431","2008-12-18T18:03:09.17Z","great set !","this is one of my favourites. maxilos has a blaster, a big blade and a bendable torso and long legs and of course spinax.this is a set that i would recommend this to bionicle collectors.
this would be good in a combiner set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"IndyMan","2009-05-09T12:34:29.78Z","This is a great set to have!","I found this set long after they stopped selling. I found him in a new Toys R' Us store that just opened. I bought it for $25 total (its usually $30). I think this set is great, you might have a hard time finding it though. 

Heres what I think about it:

Pros: Maxilos is about 10 inches tall, Spinax is the same size as regular $13 BIONICLEs, Maxilos is really stiff and has a good balance, Maxilos' weapon is about 7 inches, and has a few really rare pieces.

Cons: Gun on Maxilos' Shoulder doesn't fire well at all, and the chain that hooks up to Spinax is to short. 

I rate this great set a 4 1/2 out of 5. I would recomend this to anyone that loves BIONICLEs and big Action Figure Toys.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-29T04:57:59.62Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Warriors) - Maxilos and Spinax Review","This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well. We get a cool looking figure named Maxilos and a skeleton dog named Spinax. The arms, the legs, the feet, the hands and the head of Maxilos can be moved and on one shoulder you can see a gun which can shoot some flick-missiles. The only problem with this gun is that it doesn't shoot really well. I also like the design for this figure and the weapon he got in his left hand. The Spinax figure looks very awsome as well. The legs, the feet and the head can be moved and the mouth does open and close as well. This creature is attached to a chain which is attached to Maxilos as well. I really can't complain about this set. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
