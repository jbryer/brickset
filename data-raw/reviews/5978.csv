"chuofred","2007-06-13T17:12:22.293Z","A Fantastic Model to Launch Modular Design","The Market Street is one of the new themes from the Lego Factory collective that introduces modular construction.  This set is designed to promote advanced building techniques using unique pieces and connection, and it is a superb set for someone who seeks a solid introduction into modular constructions.  Some of the ideas that I personally admired are the following:

1) Details and Constructions  
Ground level twin spiral stairs, food items/crates, rounded balcony, artistic design above the market store, roof housing with deck, and especially the usage of a green exo-force hair piece as a lettuce.  Frequent introduction of filler pieces to make the walls less perfect, therefore more detailed and city-like. 

2) Combination of Colors
Dark blue, regular blue, light blue, dark bluish grey, light grey, white, and light tan all provide a harmonious framework, integrated beautifully and easy on the eyes.

3) Modular Design
Interchangeable modules from one floor or one building to another.  One can purchase similar pieces from Lego.com Pick-A-Brick to construct more modules with like colors, making this building into a majestic high-rise condo.

Since these modular designs provide such a strong foundation and are so versatile, we are going to see more and more of them showing up in the near future within Lego Factory community.  They have established a new standard and open up a greater frontier for town buildings and cityscapes.

The Market Street comes with three mini-figures and currently is only available on Lego.com Shop-At-Home, where it is priced at $89.99.

Thank you for taking your time to read over my review.  Please let me know if it has been informative.

"Mr_Hobbles","2007-06-22T19:17:43.607Z","A really nice set on it's own, and the perfect addition to 10182!","My copy of this set arrived just this morning and I've spent the last few hours building it and modifying it slightly.  I must say I love this set!

Unlike Cafe Corner, where a lot of the walls are made out of 1x6's and 1x8's, all the walls in this set are made out of 1x4's and 1x2.  This means you get lots of pieces and lots of building opportunities.

It also includes quite a lot of rare colours and pieces, such as the Medium and Dark blue, the Croissant, Apples, Cherries, and the green Exo-Force head as a cabbage!  I especially love the curved stairs at the front.

The only thing I have to mention is that the small module on the left needs slight modifications to the sidewalk mix in properly with the rest.  Fortunately, no additional pieces are needed and it takes like 30 seconds.

Other than that, a really nice set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LEGOmyeggo","2007-12-01T22:08:55.293Z","This is great, except for one thing. ","   This is a great lego set to add to my model of New York City outside Akron, Ohio. It has got a cool new style, with navy blue archs like the Cafe Corner. It also has tan at the top with tiles sticking out, and that is different. This also has rare minifigs- a girl with a jacket, man in overalls, and a kid with blonde hair and glasses. The balconys on the front are a great addition. The fact that you can easily remodel it is also great. But the only problem with me is, Lego is asking $90 USD for this set, and it is only worth $50! So I'll find all the pieces, and find instructions online to build it.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cashcleaner","2008-02-13T16:39:53.327Z","Good and bad points...","I paid $90.00 CAN for this kit on eBay (LEGO online sells it for $129.00) and feel a bit underwhelmed with what I get for the price I paid.  Market Street is a great looking kit on it's own right and is fairly well-designed, but I find the exterior facade and colour scheme really clash when attached to the Cafe Corner model.  

Another problem I've found is a lack of special elements that should have been included for the produce stands.  You've got a fruit and vegetable shop attached to the main building, but there's only two bins with fruit included.  A sales desk and cash register should have been included, as well as a few more produce bins.

As for the main building, the overall look is great with some really imaginative details.  I especially like the front railings and first floor steps.  I did find the blue and white awning over the main entrance to be a little difficult to keep straight, however.

I'm giving this kit a 3 out of 5; mostly because while it is a nice model on it's own, it doesn't fit in all that well with the Cafe Corner model and the produce shop is a little shoddy.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"brickbuilder711","2008-01-02T14:29:30.687Z","Great realistic house for your Modular Collection!","I got this set back in June and loved it. The model looks much better in real life than the pictures. I enjoyed the inclusion of medium and dark blue, and surprisingly those parts are on the online PAB and LEGO Digital Designer! The inclusion of the &quot;fruits and vegetables&quot; did well to this set and so did the realistic, aged design. The stairs make a great technique, as well as the different kinds of details to the house. Great value for the money. Only flaw may be the strength of the balconies. They can easily fall off if you try to add or remove minifigs to or from the balcony. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you enjoyed it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoGirl","2007-12-27T22:15:09.717Z","A Nice Looking, Realistic Set","I've always enjoyed the sets that are true-to-life; I'm not into the Star Wars, space, etc. types of sets.  My favorite types of sets tend to fall under the &quot;Town&quot; or &quot;City&quot; category.  Thus, this set looked mighty appealing to me.  

The reason I rated the set a &quot;4&quot; was only because of the price.  $90 is a lot for me to spend on a hobby.  The set is certainly well made and contains lots of basic as well as new and unique pieces, but spending that much makes me cringe and ensures I won't be able to buy very many of these types of sets. 

The set itself is not very difficult to put together.  The only annoyance is spending a while hunting through all the pieces to find the right one, but then again, that's part of the satisfaction of finishing the set!

Bottom Line:  If you have the money, I definitely recommend adding this set to your collection!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-18T15:50:48.483Z","Great-looking set.","This is a great-looking set, is fabulously detailed and quite fun to put together.  Included are fruit barrows, fancy-looking gateways and a towering building with balconies.  The only problem is the inside of the main building.  Instead of being one solid piece, each floor is four boards held together underneath by eight long thin plates.  No matter what I do, the plates just won't stay in place, keep coming loose as I'm building the set.  This means the walls above the floor become impossible to keep in place, and you can't not have the plates because otherwise there's nothing to hold the sections of the building (which sit on top of each otrher) in place.  Like I say, a nice building, but I think more attention should have been paid to its interior.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2008-06-18T18:36:43.36Z","Navy Blue, Medium Blue and Tan! Awesome Color Selection!","I bought this set when it was released and couldn't be happier. I know our hobby is an expensive one so I won't complain about the price ($89.99) and if you use the $10 per 100 parts, you are getting a great deal only paying 90 bucks for 1248 pieces. The design of this set is extremely detailed and thoughtful. The courtyard on the left of the main building is a nice touch as are the decorations above the gate. The fruit baskets out front are awesome. The alternating gray and navy blue 1x1 plates that are above the windows look cool. I enjoyed the balconies on each floor and the top floor can be laid on top of the 2nd floor more than 1 way. The curved stairs in front of the building are realistically designed and are a brilliant design as well. This set has so many great details that there are too many to mention. I would recommend this set to anyone reading this review whether you are into town building or not because the colors included are not your usual white, red yellow and black.

"Zac","2021-06-27T18:43:08.91Z","Underappreciated and innovative","<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Eric Brok&rsquo;s lovely Dutch row house, 10190 Market Street, occupies an anomalous position relative to the other modular buildings and has, I believe, been consistently underappreciated. It possesses striking character and aesthetics, and its design and production were innovative for their era. The first section of this review describe the set&rsquo;s inception and reception; for a discussion of the building itself, skip down a section.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Circuitous canonization</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">After the release of 10182 Caf&eacute; Corner in April 2007, Lego followed up with 10190 Market Street, released in October 2007. There appears to have been a convergence on the idea of modularity from within and without Lego. 10182 was designed by Lego&rsquo;s Jamie Berard while 10190 was designed by a Dutch AFOL, the late Eric Brok. The boxes and branding of these two early modulars thus differ completely and 10190 came in a blue &ldquo;Factory&rdquo; box, which has subsequently been the cause of much controversy.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">At the time of the release of 10190, the Factory program allowed individual customers to develop their own sets on Lego Digital Designer and then order the parts directly from Lego, complete with a customized box. 10190 may have been intended as a demonstration of the program, and to my knowledge was the only proper set released under the Factory imprimatur.</span></span></span><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">&nbsp;Its production process, in which Lego designers worked with an AFOL to realize a set for commercial release seems prescient in 2007, and Lego launched the program that would eventually become Ideas the subsequent year, in 2008.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">As further modular buildings along the lines of 10182 Caf&eacute; Corner were released in the years following 2007, the status of 10190 occasioned much debate: Had the set constituted part of the &ldquo;official&rdquo; line of modular buildings?&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">In 2017, however, 10190 appeared in the collection of modular buildings behind Jamie Berard in the designer video for 10255 Assembly Square, settling the question in favor of including 10190 in the canon of &ldquo;official&rdquo; modular buildings.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Sadly, Eric Brok died in his sleep of cancer in early June 2007, shortly after 10190 was announced in May. His premature death gave the release of 10190 a degree of poignancy that October, a sense that still inheres in the building for me. I believe the minifigure who wears glasses and appears on the upper balcony of the building to be a representation of him.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Modularity of design</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Ironically given its disputed status, 10190 is the most modular of any of the modular buildings. Indeed, given that the term &ldquo;modular building&rdquo; merely denotes buildings with floors that can be lifted off one another, one could describe 10190 as the only truly modular building. A single quote from Eric Brok appears on the back of the box and at the rear of the instructions and suggests this modularity: &ldquo;I chose a square shape for the floors so the house could be rearranged in many ways.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The three floors of the house and the roof of the market each rest on a 16x16 base and can be exchanged for one another. The staircase inside the house comes up in the center of each floor, so the floors can be rotated and still permit staircase access. The front balconies on the uppermost level of the house can be removed, and the system of tan Erling bricks on the front of the house allows the white flag and croissant sign to be repositioned on any floor. In contrast with 10182, 10190 rests on two 32x16 baseplates so that its two halves can be exchanged or even separated.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">One cannot help but admire Brok&rsquo;s imaginative system of modularity, but 10190&rsquo;s ambitions overstepped its capabilities. Each of its modular functions work, but the results are usually aesthetically disappointing or architecturally nonsensical. Rotating the upper floors of the house results in sheer walls facing the street. Moving the dark blue ground floor of the house on top of the market works fairly well, but results in a door opening onto empty space, a lack of staircase access, and a strangely truncated light blue building next door. The house looks best arranged as it is in official images; Brok&rsquo;s system, although visionary, would seem to require an architectural style more like modernism to succeed aesthetically as well as functionally.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Architecture and aging</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">I find 10190 to be one of the most characteristic and architecturally pleasing modular buildings. Only a few of the modular buildings evoke a sense of place: Paris in the case of 10182 Caf&eacute; Corner and 10243 Parisian Restaurant, and Amsterdam in the case of 10190. Its details all contribute to the effect: the decreasing size of the windows as the building rises; the 1x1 plates and tiles used as bricks above the second-floor windows; the ratio of the house&rsquo;s width to height; the stone lion grotesque at the top of the fa&ccedil;ade; and the stepped, triangular climax of this fa&ccedil;ade.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The house of 10190 is one of the few modular buildings to look good from the sides and rear. Its sides include textured bricks in light gray to break up otherwise monochromatic walls, and on the back light tan bricks have been used to fill in old window openings. Moreover, the brick-built effect has improved with age. I have had the set assembled and on display continuously since 2007, and all of the light blue bricks, and the dark blue 1x2s and 1x1s, have yellowed with age on the house&rsquo;s exterior. The 1x4 light blue bricks have yellowed consistently, but the 1x1 and 1x2 light blue bricks now appear in three slightly different hues, creating a gorgeous, subtle effect of variegation and age that suits the style of the house well.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Some reviewers have criticized 10190 for its lack of interior furnishings, an absence it shares with 10182 and to a lesser extent 10185 Green Grocer. Its interior is admittedly less than functional: the modular design and central staircases leave little interior space to be improved, and the door leading to the balcony on the uppermost floor opens directly onto a hole in the floor. I couldn&rsquo;t care less about these problems.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">10190 Market Street offers plentiful detail, architectural distinction, and boldness of design. Had it not been released in a Factory box, or had its innovative modular interchangeability been realized by subsequent sets it might be more widely recognized as the equal of its celebrated older sibling. Five stars.</span></span></span></p>

"legokoala","2010-07-30T12:30:30.543Z","Cool set!","<p>I have had this set for a couple years or so. Its really one of my best. It survives the various times I had to stick it in my closet while cleaning. But you probably aren't reading this for my stories, but for my review. So lets get to that review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Basement</h4>
<p>I will start my review off my review with the basement, which has extremely low roofing. I have so many minifigures that one of them has to live in the basement. Poor Violet...anyways, its so small that the people can't stand without the part above them to be taken off. So whenever I want to put the 1st floor on, I have to lie everyone in the basement down. But its a basement, of course its not going to be perfect. Still, it wouldn't have hurt to place another layer of bricks on. I'm sure Lego has their reasons why they didn't do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Rest</h4>
<p>I didn't do anything special with the first floor. The second floor is another person's house. The two people don't have much room but it is not really meant to be a hotel or apartment so I won't complain. The top floor is a squeeze. An old couple live up there and they don't have much room at all. One of them always is out on the balconey since they both can't fit in the room very well. When I get more houses, I will move the old couple out and have the second floor person have more room. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Other Part of the Building</h4>
<p>I used the roof of the other building as someone's house. Yes, I know, weird but its better than them being homeless. I have too many minifigures!&nbsp;The streetlamp is a nice finishing touch on the place. But you probably just want to get to the point. Yes, there is more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Overall View</h4>
<p>I love this set. Its pretty amazing. It may seem like I have alot of complaints about it with the rooms being too small but I really like it. It completes my city and will complete yours too if you get it. So get it. I don't mean to be bossy but get it. Why else would you read the reviews if you weren't going to get it?</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"EpicMindvolt","2019-06-13T04:42:45.537Z","Stunning set if you can afford it!","<p>This set really is amazing. Many people do not like is as a modular, but it is really much better than people think.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Well, you see, I actually have neither of these! I Bricklinked this set instead of paying over $1,000 USD for it, and I did not spend too much on it. Because of that, I cannot really give an accurate review of these two aspects of the set.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>A lot of the pieces in this set are common things you would find in a lot of places. However, there are a handful of interesting and valuable parts. Those Dark Blue arches (part #3308) are very rare so instead I used the newer version (part #16577). I tried to get many of the original parts, but cost prevented me from doing so. Along with the arches, I did not get the original white hose pieces. I bought and older version of that piece and paid $5 each for them. If I were to pay for the actual pieces (not yellowed ones which are ~$6 each), I would have paid probably over $10 for each one, and that was a no from me. However, the Light Bluish Gray doors I did buy original, and one of them was really expensive. I lucked out and found the cheapest one on the internet and bought it quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>If you have a large amount of town/city minifigures from the 2000&#39;s, you&#39;ll find most of the minifigure pieces to be quite common. The three minifigures included in this set are very plain, but are a very nice addition to the set. They are interesting though, since they were the only old modular set to include expressioned faces in the minifigures. The only valuable part of these minifigures is the torso for the female one. It is worth ~$10 but I was lucky to find it for just $1.85.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build is very entertaining, at least for the front of the building. You are always putting on more details on the front, using a wide variety of techniques. It was a very enjoyable build too, since each floor is built differently and with different details. The back and sides are the most boring part of the build since it is juts straight bricks, but you do get to add in some bricks here and there so the walls are not just one solid color.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>This is the best aspect of the set. It is an absolutely beautiful set, and pictures of it do not do it justice. You can see the details in the picture, but it just looks better in real life. It lacks an interior (minus the stairs), but it totally makes up in the details on the front of the model. It is one of the more detailed modulars on the exterior, and the details not only enhance the set, but provide a nostalgic feel for it as well. Even the little tiny market side of the build is packed with detail on the front, and it fits right in with a modular city. Even with all the praise I have given the set, I am still confused as to why the deck on the third floor faces to the side and not the back. Placing it against another modular would just result in the minifigures looking at a wall! However, said deck is nice and even provides a swivel chair.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>This set is an incredible modular building. Despite being the smallest, you could argue that it is the most detailed on the outside, which totally makes up for its lack of interior. I would totally recommend this set to anybody, if you have a way to pay for it! I wish I could tell you about how much I paid for it, but I have to estimate because I never kept track of my orders. I probably spent around ~$250 on this, and that is with some piece substitutions. If you were to Bricklink the original pieces, I&#39;d expect to pay upwards of $300. If you were to buy the set itself used, be prepared to pay over $400, and don&#39;t even get me started on sealed copies!</p>

<p>In the end, I am glad I spent the money on this. I think it is totally worth it, and it would add great display and monetary value to any LEGO city. Now its time to Bricklink the Cafe Corner!</p>
