The feet are great, but no very are the piraka legs. Two vakama hordika's heads are included as armors, without these, the legs are strange. Have two takadox's swords, and with the armors, the arms aren't very playable. The head don't likes a mask, (includes pridak's feet), but in the story it is(the maxilos' and hydraxon's face looks like more a mask than karzahni's). Karzahni wears a black cover, and have two chains. The set includes two matoran, idris and sarda, a blue and a red. These have useful pieces, their weapons, and feet. Some toa like the ignika have shorter feets, than these. The idris matoran have a ruru, and this mask don't like a female mask, and some blue characters too.

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-23T22:11:22.763Z","No complaints!!","I got Karzahni '07 Christmas, just before he got sold out.  Oh, and as for the title for this review, I actually do, infact, have ONE complaint: his burning chains are too short.  I was thinking about calling this set a four, but because of the two Matoran (Sarda and Idris) and the trap, it just deserves at least a 4.7/5.  I like the interesting Mask of Alternate Futures.  It's actually made of lots of different elements.  Let me get more organized here, just a sec...

Pros:

Interesting Mask of Alternate Futures

Two Matoran! (nice change from Dekar and Defilak)

"Carl","2009-11-07T05:46:13.67Z","""Your such a beautiful freak""","This will be a part by part review of a truly amazing set.

1: Sarda

Sarda is the red Matoran. He has Toa Metru Vakama's mask, a silver Toa Mata Onua claw and two of Mantax's claws, the latter looking sort of strange but still cool.. His build is the same as Defilak and Dekar, apart from the feet. The Hordika chest plate is great, and the Toa Inika feet add a nice touch to Sarda, seeing as Matoran feet are usually quite boring. Although, Idris has Toa Metru of Earth(black colour) Whenua's mask but in blue, whereas Sarda's was red on Toa Metru Vakama. I think that they could have had Toa Metru Onewa's mask in red, but otherwise Sarda is a good Matoran.
Sarda: 4/5

2: Idris

Idris is the blue Matoran. He has Toa Metru Whenua's mask, but in blue, a silver Toa Mata Onua claw and a Solek sword with fang-hilt. The feet are great and the Hordika chest plate looks good on the Mahri Matoran. He is built using exactly the same pieces in exactly the same places as all the other Mahri Matoran, but with different colours. Unlike Dekar, Defilak and Sarda, Idris's leg connectors are transperent blue instead of dark grey. In my opinion Idris is the better of the two Matoran.
Idris: 5/5

3: The Trap

The trap function is really well and it stands up straight when placed on the ground. It securely holds Karzahni when he is put in it and it is a really neat little addition to the set, seeing as most Titan sets only come with the Titan. The trap is really cool in my opinion.
The Trap: 5/5

4: Karzahni

Karzahni is a mutated being, once the ruler of the realm Karzahni. and he certainly looks mutated to me. His head has finally made Pridak's size 17 feet look good: coloured green and with two transperant red fangs as eyes on top. Karzahni's head also has two horns, in silver, which just add that little bit of awesomeness to him. The Carapar chest-plate/Mantax shoulder-pads are used as Karzahni's chest-plate and shoulder-pads, and they look amazing in green. Toa Vakama Hordika heads are used as leg-pads and Mantax's feet in green are Karzahni's feet. Ehlek's heads are Karzahni's hands, with a dark green horn in each eyehole, like fingers. The Vezon chains look cool and are his primary weapons. Vezon's cape is also used as Karzahni's cape and that looks quite cool too. Two of Takdox's blades are on his chest as... well I actually don't know what they are. But they still look cool on him. The squid launcher however, as I've said in previous reviews, sucks. It can't even fire properly, and from what I've read on Brickset it seems that almost everyone agrees with me. But you can just take it off and so it's fine.
Karzahni: 5/5

In this set there are lots of re-coloured pieces and they have re-used lots of awesome pieces. The Matoran and the trap add extra awesomeness to an already awesome Bionicle.

"Cirvihi","2020-11-08T08:50:03.62Z","So this is Karzahni, the jailer of Matoran, the would-be avatar of evil.","<p>When this set first hit shelves, I was beginning to attend middle school in Florida. Around this same time, Toys &#39;R&#39; Us stores were starting to disappear around my state, so grabbing a limited edition set from a store that was going to be a long drive my parents wouldn&#39;t take was not in the cards for me. When the ball joint system got updated (twice!), I gave up any hope that I would ever acquire this set and even convinced myself that I didn&#39;t need it at all. But as years passed, and the pandemic hit us, I decided to rethink my stance on getting this set. Rereading reviews and scouting the Internet for&nbsp;listings, I decided to grab this set sealed in the original box since used copies weren&#39;t significantly cheaper and many of them had reasons to not get them in the first place. After having the set built for about a month now, I can say with full confidence that while I&#39;m glad to finally have this set in my possession, the overall feeling is bittersweet.</p>

<p>Sarda) Easily the most basic model in this set, Sarda is nonetheless a welcome inclusion here. With a standard colour scheme of dark red and dark bluish grey, along with a non-recolored great Huna, Sarda partially gives off a Toa Vakama vibe. This isn&#39;t a deal-breaker or anything, but it&#39;s harder for the figure to have his own identity, especially since the other three Matoran don&#39;t have this problem themselves.&nbsp;The Inika feet on this one are slightly slimmer than the ones on Idris, so the figure doesn&#39;t always have to be in an active pose. The claw on him doesn&#39;t look bad, and while I do like the two blades on his left hand, they seem a little impractical to use on account of his pre-bent wrist, though that could be because I see it doubling as a shield.</p>

<p>Idris) The more interesting of the two Matoran featured in this set, I have always been a sucker for the trans-fluorescent blue colouring, and its inclusion alongside the dark blue just makes it work even more effectively. Whereas Sarda could have benefitted from a recolored Komau or Mahiki, Idris actually manages to take a dark blue Ruru and make it feminine enough for this set. Where I wish dark blue had been applied, however, is in the arm pieces. Dekar had black arms because yellow arms would have been too overbearing, Defilak had green arms and Sarda had red, so why couldn&#39;t blue arms that were previously used in Bordakh not be used here? I fixed this problem beforehand with a simple&nbsp;BrickLink purchase, but the point still stands. Once again, the claw doesn&#39;t look bad and I actually dig the extended blade that she wields, adds a bit more personality to her. The feet look fine on her, but are too wide and make posing her casually more difficult.</p>

<p>Both Matoran have the unique characteristic of having coloured eyes with a breathing tube that wraps around the back. Unlike the Piraka spines of the previous year, these don&#39;t hinder the head articulation in any concernable way, though them coming out the back of their skulls is certainly an... interesting look to say the least. Overall, these are welcome foils to our titular villain, with some welcome cosmetic changes from the Matoran released earlier that year. While they aren&#39;t perfect, I am at least glad that they went for something different.</p>

<p>Trap) I figured that it would be most appropriate to tackle this right before I covered the big guy himself, so here we go. The trap has a bit of a hodge podge quality to it, which makes sense considering it was created from weapons and other bits found inside a Barraki weapons cache, and it&#39;s certainly not a knock on the final model. The red bits help to stand out against a base colour scheme of grey and silver, though it occurred to me mid-build it was only used to show kids where a function was, whereas something like the Exo-Toa at least used it a little more to give it some life. One of the main things I&#39;ve been trying to avoid with this model is having it posed in a way that ends up bending the Bordakh staves on the bottom over time, and I do think this could have been remedied with a 4x4 Technic liftarm placed at the bottom.</p>

<p>The function itself works pretty well, utilising the same mechanism as the legs on Lesovikk&#39;s Sea Sled, and it has a decent grip on Karzahni whenever you pose him right inside it. Having said that, I do think that a mechanism where the button was located in the middle might have been more effective for play. Picture it, your hulking brute of a figure is running when he suddenly trips, lands into the middle of the trap, and SNAP! And this might just be me personally, but I kind of wish the trap had a finger-lock orientation instead of one half overlapping the other. Overall, it&#39;s a very interesting inclusion in the set, certainly something I don&#39;t think anyone would ever anticipate being used in a non-system based line like this (But then this set is a bit of an anomaly to begin with).</p>

<p>Karzahni) Finally, I want to talk about the main character himself, and trust me when I say there&#39;s a lot to talk about here, and it unfortunately isn&#39;t all great. This figure is why I insisted I get the set brand new instead of going for half-measures, though as I&#39;ll touch upon, it doesn&#39;t make much of a difference at this point and will all depend on your preference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting with the legs, I very much like the use of the Mantax feet with the added heel supports, definitely fitting for a titan set like this. The Piraka limbs are perfectly utilised here, they&#39;re not lanky looking like the Rahkshi limbs, which I would say are better used for the arms than for the legs. I want to sing praises for the upper legs as well, but they sadly aren&#39;t perfect. I will say that whoever decided to use Vakama Hordika heads as armor deserves points for creativity, and its transition into the Metru chest piece gives it a nice look. However, while I imagine that was the only Hordika head that wouldn&#39;t move up and down, its side-to-side movement could have easily been prevented with a longer pin piece going through the Metru chest. The other issue, and I genuinely don&#39;t know if this is due to age or my nostalgia preventing me from remembering the truth, is that the friction pieces don&#39;t work nearly as well as they should. The figure can hold itself up just fine, but moving the whole figure around will cause the legs to flail in all directions.</p>

<p>Regarding the torso, while I do think the wide hips help to show him as a hulking figure, I can&#39;t help but wonder if there was a way to reduce it from 11 studs to 9 or even 7 studs (I&#39;m looking at you, Kongu Marhi torso). The combination of three torso pieces is an interesting choice for sure, but it only seems to be done for the sake of having two Takadox daggers on the sides. I am personally glad to finally own this part after so many years, but I cannot for the life of me figure out their purpose. It&#39;s like a less well-thought-out version of Brutaka&#39;s back blades, and I can&#39;t imagine they&#39;re extra limbs &agrave; la Voporak. The overall front look is fine, having a good amount of silver broken up with a nice two-toned green armor shell, and the claw placed below it doesn&#39;t look bad.&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure if I care for the red gills at all; I feel like they&#39;re only present to either match the eyes or to justify all the red axles, and using silver or black or even making them in lime would have&nbsp;fitted much better.</p>

<p>One thing I don&#39;t think I can take much away from this set is the head, because it not only has a nice and mutated fish-like appearance, but the usage of the Pridak feet is honestly something to beholden. The red eyes contrast the green very well, seeing the toes double as mouth and nose features is nice detailing, and even the silver spikes on the side have grown on me, since the original Olisi also has silver spikes jutting out of it. This mutated mask necessitates a thicker neck, and the&nbsp;posability can get you all the important positions if you&#39;re patient enough. And lastly, there&#39;s the cape which I&#39;m very 50/50 on. The connection made with the Technic through the cape into the neck is ingenious, and I&#39;m glad to finally have Vezon&#39;s cape again since it&#39;s a very nice looking cape. However, it&#39;s also a little too small on this figure, to the point where a new one or even a resized one should have been commissioned. Have it drooped down to about his knees, relocate the lower-right tear&nbsp;so that the right gill doesn&#39;t run into it, try to justify it as something more than a covering for his gappy back. Also, this set is why Maxilos has Lehvak-Kal shields in gunmetal grey instead of any other Bohrok shields, and you can&#39;t convince me otherwise.</p>

<p>The arms are basic in their overall construction, but the inclusion of more recolored Mantax armor adds to the bulkiness of the character, and the spikes are welcome as well. Going all the way down will talk you to the hands, and here&#39;s where things go sour. I like the creative usage of the Ehlek heads, and I&#39;m even not terribly bothered by the fact that they aren&#39;t recolored (though I hope they at least considered it). But I just have one little question: WHO DESIGNED THE EYE SOCKETS FOR THIS PART?! One of the reasons I shelled out the money that I did for this set new was because I knew those claws would be loose, but I hoped they would&nbsp;stay in place if the parts were mint. They are loose from the moment you put them in, and they barely stay in afterwards! I had to put tape on the connection point just like I did when I built Rocka XL, but I don&#39;t know how well it will stay on a hard plastic piece versus the rubber spikes from that set! The hands look good on this figure (even if I don&#39;t know what those two small claws in-between are supposed to be), but this error is honestly unforgivable!</p>

<p>Everyone has talked about the Squid Launcher already, it&#39;s a nice and inventive idea based on the setting that should have been less of a hassle to shoot with than it ended up being, and I blame that on the fact it should have been made out of hard plastic. But do you know what would have really been an ingenious idea for this set? What if the malicious Karzahni, in an effort to take down his water-breathing foes, was instead equipped with an Inika-style Air Launcher to poison the Matoran or Lesovikk? I&#39;m just saying, you have to think outside the box on these things. And there isn&#39;t much to say about the chain, I have always liked these chain link pieces, and they are used very well in this set.</p>

<p>Overall, Karzahni has a great silhouette, standing roughly a foot tall and simply radiating both sheer power and madness. It&#39;s clear that a lot of thought was put into this figure, and certainly a number of things were carried over from his depiction in Bionicle: World to better showcase how both figures convey the same character. However, a lot of things don&#39;t work for this figure, and I sadly can&#39;t say that many of the things people complain about on him are entirely misplaced. He is top-heavy, his visual cohesion is questionable, and many of his design choices ultimately are not executed as well as they either should have been or as they may have been conveyed on paper.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts) If it seems as though I&#39;ve been running this set through the ringer, I genuinely did not set out to make a negative review. But just like Mutran &amp; Vican, this is a set I had built up for myself over the years and was just left wanting more from it when it was finally in my possession. There is a lot to get out of this set; it&#39;s not only a great display piece, not only is it a nice collector&#39;s item, but it&#39;s the best example of the &ldquo;conflict-in-a-box&rdquo; that you could ask for in a Bionicle set from either generation. I paid about $300 for mine brand new in box, and I think that I satisfied myself in making that decision. But I would not make that same recommendation for the rest of you, unless you simply demand your sets be purchased sealed in their original packaging. As for the rest of you, all I suggest is make sure every piece is being included, and you probably won&#39;t be able to tell the difference between a used set and one straight from the box.</p>

<p>In the end, this set managed to swim for a couple of minutes, but that wasn&#39;t enough to keep it from ultimately sinking.</p>

I&#39;ll be going over the 4 builds and their pros and cons individually.</p>

<p>Exceedingly rare Ruru mask in dark blue.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Wide feet limit leg movement (wider feet than Sarda).</p>

<p>Works well (can wrap around Karzahni).</p>

<p>Tons of blade pieces (8 Vahki Bordakh swords, 2 Hewkii Mahri spears and one Mahri Matoran blade).</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>The two swords used to support the trap are put under a lot of strain. The axles on the swords may break because of this.</p>

<p>Karzahni:</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Complex titan build that can move well.</p>

<p>Several rare recoloured parts (Carapar armour in lime green, Pridak feet in dark green, Mantax feet in dark green and dark green Vakama Hordika masks) and a rare cloth cape.</p>

<p>Set is very well armoured in all areas.</p>

<p>Has a *functional* squid launcher and chains for weapons.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karzahni&#39;s&nbsp;balance is on the poor side.</p>

<p>Fingers can swivel and fall out easily.</p>

<p>Squid launcher does not work well.</p>

<p>Squid ammo constantly&nbsp;falls out of the storage clamps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, after that mouthful of a recap, I have to say that this is a favourite set of mine. The four complex builds, the rare and colourful pieces and the building experience make for an awesome set. The only issue I have with the set is the price tag. 5/5</p>
