Firstly, to review small sets, is necessary makes a comparision with small sets. Secondly, if it is playable, have good and useful contents altough is small, this deserves a good rate. The good contents are the crossbows, the minifigure, his helmet, the two paddles and the shield. The colors too are useful if combined with the small sets. The builting is easy, due to have few pieces. The playability too, makes the knight uses the padles to drive the boat. The builting of the boat is solid and don't dismantles easy. If this small set have good things in comparision with others, why rate it low? And one thing more: This set, altough small, can increase the castle sets, is playable, is easy to build, being recommended to also little childrens, and was released in small package!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
