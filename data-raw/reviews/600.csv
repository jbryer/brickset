"jman","2007-03-08T20:02:44.47Z","Brilliant!! Small Aqua Set","This is a great little set that in light of it's small size offers great play adventures on it's own. An Aqua diver whose equipment (knife and flippers) become part of the scooter when not being used and a control panel (no sticker...yeah). Well Worth the money if you can find one!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-07-30T13:49:13.13Z","Worth every penny - if you see it buy it.","Very inexpensive LEGO set around one US dollar. Great mini figure with flippers and a silver knife. The helment is different than most Aqua Divers I have in my collection. Simple set with just a few pieces, easy to put together, little set has alot of playability. Recommend this little set if you happen to come across it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

And I'm an Aquaphobe in real life, well not entirely, I just can't put my head under water or I'll start to panic and tense up and such. But I digress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LEGO Aquazone introduced under water adventures as the Aquanauts searched through the depths for the powerful and mysterious energy crystals. Their competition were the Aquasharks, the Aquaraiders and the Stingrays. Their allies were the Hydronauts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was one of the few sets I picked up, it was an impulse buy with a unique looking Mini-Figure and a small underwater vehicle. Like something out of James Bond or something. The model is a simple build with few pieces, but it is fun to play with. There are endless possibilities with this little set, also it is the only one with the Mini-Figure with the black visored helmet if memory serves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd recommend this set to any fans of the Aquazone Theme, there are a lot of possibilities and buying up more than one of this set troop builds your Aquanauts. As a bonus you get two silver chromed daggers and if memory serves this set also included flippers for the Aquanaut to use while exploring.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5
"Pheedle","2016-05-17T06:49:44.543Z","Nostalgia is a powerful, blinding force","<p>When I was a young lad, maybe 10 or so, ever few weekends my Nana and Pop would take us kids to the shops. And back in these ancient days, you could expect to stroll into a shopping center and find an array of tiny lego sets like this one for about $5. It became tradition that Nana would sneakily give me a $10 note and tell me to buy two. Nostalgia is indeed a powerful force.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For such a tiny set, there are some worthwhile pieces here. The chrome knives were a mainstay of sets at the time, and they give great detail to any set or scene.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Whilst the fellow himself is fairy common fare for the set, its the helmet and mask that I remember best. The big, white piece fit over head and body and added to the underwater explorer feel. Sadly I don&#39;t feel that Ive seen enough of these in recent years.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>From an objective view this set is at best a filler piece for a larger display. However from a nostalgia perspective, it brings back great memories of itself and much of the 90&#39;s lego. I still have the original set, proudly displayed alongside the larger Aquazone&nbsp;sets.&nbsp;</p>
