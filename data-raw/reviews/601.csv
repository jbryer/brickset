"pod120","2009-02-23T22:50:34.983Z","The Perfect Stocking Filler!","I spotted this at a Lego shop in December 2006 and I was with my parents as they were looking for gifts for a Christmas party. Just as we were leaving I asked if I could get it, but my parents said they had already chosen something. However 3 weeks later on Christmas Eve I received sets 7240 and 7896 and did not realise at first that this was also beneath the wrapping paper!

About the set, I love the background on the packaging, it improves the look of the set. The sleigh is a great design for a set from 1995 and this is the set that Lego City needs, Santa, His sleigh and the joy of Christmas!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I wrote to Lego a letter with my ideas in 1995 as I was 13 years old. After some weeks i got a big A4 format envelope with full of Lego Factory prospekts and this set.
I was very very happy becouse of it!

"zipper","2012-02-25T00:47:19.823Z","Great Christmas set!","The first time that I saw this set I knew that I had to have it. The santa minifig is really cool due to the beard and cap. Honestly, there isn't a lot to look at, but that doesn't matter when it's Christmas time and everyone is looking at the cool Christmas Lego set that you have out on display. It's easily worth the money.",FALSE,4,4,2,2,5
