"oldfan","2013-08-06T13:17:08.66Z","Oddly appealing","Growing up the son of an airline pilot, I've always been fascinated by airplanes, so it's natural that I love collecting LEGO airplanes and related sets as well. &nbsp;So, I was going to get this set regardless of its design, looks, appeal, cost (don't tell the wife I said that!), etc. &nbsp;As I grew the collection over the years, I kind of developed a soft spot for the various small ""airline-exclusive"" sets from the 90's. &nbsp;LEGO tends to stretch their design and aesthetic boundaries when putting together these exclusives, and they really stand out when displayed next to the excellent but similar-looking planes in the ""standard"" system sets. &nbsp;1808 is no exception, let's review my impressions:<div><br></div><div>-While general aviation and its multitude of single-engine propeller planes is a large community in the USA, there are not very many LEGO sets that capture this type of airplane model (there are lots of twin-propeller planes in the catalog, though). &nbsp;While you build this model, you start to appreciate the difficulty of rendering this type of plane in brick form, and you can understand why most LEGO GA/propeller planes use engines on the wing instead of in the nose. It's not easy getting that look in such a small model with so few parts, and since the end result is less than perfect, I totally understand why it's not replicated very often. &nbsp;But again, it looks accurate enough, and fills a place in your LEGO airport layout.</div><div><br></div><div>-The old rounded vertical tailpiece from the '70's makes a rare modern appearance, and fits in well in this scale. &nbsp;I'm not sure why the ""exclusive airline"" logo is used on a single-passenger private airplane, but you can always leave the sticker off for more realism.</div><div><br></div><div>-Non-retractable landing gear is typical for these small planes, but the rear wheel carriage seems a bit blocky. &nbsp;Considering the great detail at the front and rear of the little plane, this is a miss in this model for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>-The mechanic's shed is a nice excuse to provide a second minifigure and the ""wheel of tools"" that was fairly new at the time. &nbsp;The presence of a large second propellor mounted via technic pin on the side of the shed usually prompts a double-take from me; it almost looks like a badly-designed windmill on the side of the building! &nbsp;While I understand that the intent is to provide a ""spare"" propellor (both for repairing your damaged plane during play, and for allowing the build of a twin-prop MOC with this set's parts somewhere down the line), the mounting point on the shed looks a little strange to me.</div><div><br></div><div>I love the unique looks of the exclusive sets, and while this one isn't perfect, it works pretty well on its own and as part of your classic town's airport layout.</div>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,3
