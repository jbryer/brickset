So the predecessor of a great theme like <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space"">Space</a>. The set shows a small command centre, a launching base with probably an Apollo rocket and the fueling installation. Also present a small car to take the astronauts to the Rocket. All very basic but very recognizable which is the strenght of sets like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 4 bricks : great fun to built a vintage set like this, not difficult thanks to the white dots on the rare red baseplate. The base itself is easy, the fuel installation asks more attention. The rocket is based on 2 trainrails and has a great launching device made of black slopes and round studs. The rocket is made of macaroni bricks, looks great but a bit weak : it falls apart easily. The car is very basic but nice. A great detail is the transparant radar with turntable&nbsp;on the command centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 4 bricks : great parts for a set this old but basic. Several good blue plates and a lot of round studs and the macaroniparts are usefull too. I love the transparant plates.&nbsp;Best part of the set is the unique red baseplate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability&nbsp;3 bricks : no minifigures yet in 1973 so that reduces the playability, certainly compared with more recent sets. Still&nbsp;3 bricks because of the posibility to move the Rocket and the small car. You have to see it in the perspective of the year of production.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks : <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=358-1"">Bricklink</a> offers an average price of € 45,00 for sold sets and an average price&nbsp;of € 63,00 for sets for sale. I bought it in a lot together with other vintage sets and had it for less but without original instructions. I think a reasonable&nbsp;average price (if complete) can be some € 50,00 for a good vintage set like this.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,4
