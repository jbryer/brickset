The model lacks playability of course, but it blurs the line between being a toy and a purely artistic object. If you're a vintage car fan, there's pleasure to be had here.</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,5

I threw away the box not long after building it. I used to be able to take it apart and put it back without the instructions. It got put away when we moved, and I found it in the attic of my parents house when I moved out. I am now 50 and still have it. It&#39;s a great set, I love the shape without the modern special shaped bricks you get now. Although I own 2 of these now, I am looking to convert the newer set to a pick up body with some spare parts I have collected. I am on the hunt for a box. To sum up, a great set that now displays well as a retro sculpture. I often get asked about it.</p>
