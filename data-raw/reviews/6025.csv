I got this set when I was 6 or 7, and more than 30 years later decided to build it again. I dug out the instructions, managed to find nearly all the old pieces, and replaced a couple of missing bits via Bricklink.

An excellent set, and a great trip down memory lane. I just wish I still had the box.

I had really wanted the Thatcher Perkins train but it was too expensive. But our local shop had sold it by time I had saved enough pennies. After finding my old cadilac, I embarked on a mission to complete the set of my childhood dreams. I first bought a unboxed set at a car boot for &pound;5. But recently bought a superb boxed example very cheaply off eBay. This is another really good set. The shape is really nice, the blue colour&nbsp;stands out, especially with those white wheels. A real work of art, great display piece, even the girlfriend likes these old sets as display items.&nbsp;</p>
