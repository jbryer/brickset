This F1 car is really, really detailed and looks like one too. These sets should be rereleased because they're so good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

My local shop never had this one on sale all those years ago so it was off my radar. I picked up my first set very cheaply as it was missing a few bits, it is now complete and displays great, a real conversation piece. It is quite a difficult build compared to some other sets but the shape is really good. The stickers set it off nicely. The engine in yellow is quite a nice touch. I managed to pick up a boxed set recently for a song from a school sale, followed by another unboxed set from a charity shop whilst on a business trip. These hobby sets are set to be a design classic, I love them.</p>
