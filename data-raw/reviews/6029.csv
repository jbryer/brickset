1) It's totally out of scale with all other Lego sets you might have owned at the time
2) The wheels are totally useless for anything other than building vintage cars
3) There was no alternative model to build
4) The windscreen was rubbish
5) No steering

Now the good points

1) This was really good fun to build.  Back in the mid-70s, Lego kits were SMALL, and SQUARE. This was big and had lots of round pieces and contours made up of lots of fiddly flat bits.
2) It looked like a real car.  Finally I could build something my parents actually thought was good!
3) It was surprisingly good fun to play with, if a little delicate.  Surprising, considering it had no working parts.

It somehow stood apart from all my other non-Technic sets - it's the only one I ever kept apart in its own box (and a biscuit tin after the box disintegrated), which explains why it survived to this day.

Maybe its the name Rolls Royce, or maybe its just a good set.  But I like this one.

This set is a little different from the other hobby set cars as lego&nbsp;attempted to add detail to the interior by putting in a steering wheel. It looks great in white, the matching white wheels compliment&nbsp;the body nicely contrasting against the black mudguards. I would like to get enough parts to make another, but modify it to make the Rolls&nbsp;Royce armoured car from the First World War. The red solid wheels would be perfect. These early sets have a style that really appears to me.</p>
