My local shop sold out of these before I could save enough, then they stopped production. I was so exited when I finally got to build this set, there are a few tricky bits that are not too clear on the instructions. The cab does seem to be a bit large when compared to the rest of the model and lego&nbsp;could have tried to put a little detail in the cab. I now have another box less set that is on display with the other hobby sets I have. I have seen photos of the real train, and am currently designing a tender on mecabricks to match the train, so far so good.</p>

I can still remember building it and how big it seemed compared to the smaller lego models that I had at that time. &nbsp;By today&#39;s standards, it&#39;s extremely basic and in places, quite fragile. &nbsp;But it has so much charm it&#39;s off the scale. &nbsp;You can&#39;t build that into a model, it acquires it in the mind of the builder</p>

<p>Today, 35 years later, it sits on the shelf next to my Star Wars UCS collection. I&#39;m sure the lego designer of the time would have been amazed if they could have looked ahead to see the detail and construction techniques of lego models of the future. But if my house was on fire and I had to run back in to grab one lego model, it wouldn&#39;t be my UCS Falcon, or ISD, it&#39;d be this blocky, fragile train - no question!</p>
