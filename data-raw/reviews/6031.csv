For its size and presumed cost it was quite a good set, featuring a minifig with a removable safety vest and articulated loader element. Also, being in Australia I could move the steering wheel to the other side. Giving it a 5. Obviously sentimental reasons have something to do with it but it's hard to fault anyway.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Mawich","2010-09-30T17:29:20.36Z","The set that started it all...","I'm 99.99% sure this was the very first Town themed set I ever received.&nbsp; My parents had previously purchased set 50 (Basic Building Set) for my brother and I, but set 607 marked the beginning of what was to become a life long (with a few dark ages thrown in) interest in Lego Town.&nbsp; <br><br>The Town theme at the time was essentially divided into three price points: Sets that kids could purchase with their pocket money such as this one, larger sets that kids could purchase if they saved a bit for it and the largest sets such as Fire and Police stations that required the purchasing power of parents and relations.<br><br>The set came with a few pieces which were rarely if ever seen again as the workers vest and the shovel but the rest of the set was pretty standard.&nbsp; It wasn't particularly useful as a loader simply because the shovel couldn't be lifted above the height of the side of a dump truck but it was gainfully employed as a clearer of debris on streets in the town I had as a kid.<br><br>Though this set may appear overly simplistic compared to the modern City range, it has a simplistic charm about it that is common with many of the smaller sets from that era.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"jmupton2000","2017-12-30T17:24:10.39Z","My First Ever Set...","<p>This was my first ever set way back in 1979 and somehow managed to avoid being broken up all that time.&nbsp; It&#39;s a classic&nbsp;example of simple, fun, low cost little sets that these days are catered for by Polybags&nbsp;in the same &#39;pocket money&#39; price bracket.</p>

<p>I have as a result collected dumper trucks in the Legoland/Town/City range ever since right up and including the most recent included in Set 60184 released in 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>If I am correct, the box was a fairly small one and many sets of this price bracket and era came in similarly sized boxes.&nbsp; The instruction leaflet is one of the long fold out double sided sheets with seven building stages on one side whilst the other features a general view of various Town theme sets of the time (many of them now regarded rightly as classics) on a large number of the old style 32x32 road boards.&nbsp; In addition a number of featured products are highlighted including the road board packs and the workshop/garage set 361.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Just twenty three parts made up the set including the classic metal axle fitted 2x2 plates with red hubs, the hinged yellow bucket part and&nbsp;of course the minifigure himself.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>The minifigure&nbsp;does not really get any more classic Lego Town/City than this chap here who wears the traditional red safety helmet, classic smiley face head, plain blue torso and black legs.&nbsp; The vest part (long since out of production sadly) is in yellow and had black/yellow warning stripe stickers supplied to fit both front and back although the box picture seems to indicate these were also issued as a preprinted part rather than applied with a sticker.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>Not much to it really, a set of wheels/axles fitted to a few plates with a steering wheel and a few bricks on top plus the hinged bucket on the front and that is about it.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>The finished model and its accompanying minifigure&nbsp;was a nice little simple vehicle with lots of playability at a very reasonable price.&nbsp; Many a Lego fan seems to have started with this set and a number or related construction vehicles of the same period.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Conclusions:</strong></p>

<p>A classic little set that still looks good even now.&nbsp; Mine is still in one piece although its minifigure&nbsp;looks decidedly worn now, his hands have faded, he had to have his legs replaced in about 1983 after a nasty accident and the stickers on the vest are very grubby and worn.</p>

<p>Even if I ever disposed of all my Lego, this is the one set I would still keep.</p>
