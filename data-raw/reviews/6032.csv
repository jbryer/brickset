I would buy it again.
It's easy that it is devidable in 3 parts for transport.
Some parts are a little bit weak once put together but it isn't for children I think.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ant","2007-11-20T02:24:49.763Z","Monster of a Set","This replica of the Eiffel Tower weighs in at 3428 pieces, standing 1.02 meters high and 0.5 by 0.5 meters at the base. It is the third largest set ever, tailing second (UCS Death Star) by 14 pieces! Being a lot larger once built, and me not owning the Death Star, I'm happy to believe this is the second largest set.

It took me about 7hr15 to build. The construction is divided into 3 sections, each with its own instruction manual:
- The base, consisting of the promenade below the tower, the stone feet on with it                  stands (along with some stores), the 4 legs of the tower, joined by arches, and even 4 cable cars (2 each on opposite corners).
This took me the longest to build at 4hrs

- The center section (from the glass to where the legs meet), again with 2 cable cars (1 each on opposite corners)

- The spire, which is the tallest individual section, with a center column with a few lift cars this time. It has a great cap, showing off good use of the (relatively new) 1x1 cheese wedges, as well as a French flag and 2 satellite dishes on a silver rod (some people mention receiving a bley rod however.

The tower is constructed mainly of dark bley pieces, with tan being used for the feet and some bley for the promenade. Other small details (the stores and cable car/lifts) use brown, yellow and red pieces.

This set amazing, showing a lot of detail as well as being massive once built

pro's:
- a lot of clever building techniques
- set is huge
- small details
- set is easy to move, since it can be separated into 3 sections


cons's:
- some building techniques are quite unstable
- some pieces (I noticed the 1x2x1 corners) have variations (such as the center rod underneath being hollow in some and solid in others)
- building can get very repetative

This great set is a must for any serious Lego collector",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

All I could dream of after a visit, is how cool it would be to get such a HUGE kit like that and be able to build it. I hope against hope that under the Christmas tree would be some impressive, massive, challenging lego structure for me to spend the rest of the holidays building and rebuilding, until I could do it by memory alone.

Now I am a card carrying ALOFL, and Lego are bringing out these huge dream kits. I mean you just have to know their marketing department's figured us out. We have the credit cards, and the dream, they just have to provide us that irresistable challenge.

Sure there are many pieces, and there is a lot of repetitive steps - but hey - the Eiffle tower is a rather large geometric shape, it is bound to be a bit symetrical and thus a bit repetitive, much like a 3000pc jigsaw puzzle can be a little repetitive. Anyone who buys it and complains about the boring nature of building four legs should probably return to Duplo.

This was fun. I am not a fast builder, so around 14 hours for me, a couple of hours a night in front of the idiot box. about 2 hours to unpack and pre-sort the pieces and 12 for the build. Besides you would hope $299 would provide more than a few hours of distraction.

For me the wonder of lego, is how the designers can get such seemingly innoculous pieces to form such impressive shapes. I love the way the lego rises in 3D to fulfil it's potential.

It was immensely satisfying to finish and step back from the Eiffel Tower and see it in it's entirity.

I am glad I got this kit, and happy Lego is looking after us.

Next up will be the Taj Mahal. Can't wait.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I really like the little French flag on top of the tower which gives it an authentic feel. If you like Legos and live in France, pick this up.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-02-08T19:34:27.84Z","majestic","HHHHEEEEEYYYYY! Another supergiant! And entirely worth the price,too! What more couldja want? Great details! Amazing tactics! I really don't know how the overall rating for this lego right now is 3.9, I'll have to read some of the other reviews after this. Looks great if you have the statue of liberty lego as well, and if you think its un accurate, then compare it to the scene from rush hour 3 and you'll see how accurate it really is. Lego got lucky on the simplicity of the french flag, or else they'd have to have used another blasted decal, which this lego is thankfully free of.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lego12","2008-07-22T12:49:58.56Z","Welcome to Paris!","   The Eiffel Tower is the biggest set I have ever built! It is HUGE!  I mean it is GIGANTIC! It took me about 2 days to build (I am a slow builder):P

   You start out with the bottom (arch) and that was the hardest and took me the longest (one day). There are four &quot;legs&quot; and on two of the &quot;legs&quot; There are two elevators that are yellow and on the other &quot;leg&quot; red elevators.  It was fun and frustrating building the arch considering the fact that the bags aren't numbered, and 3,428 pieces is A LOT!

   The second part you build is the middle section that I thought was easy. The building here is fun and not frustrating. The elevators continue to go up the tower...  You get less and less pieces as you build (duh)! 

   The last section is the tallest and the easiest section to build. The elevators get smaller. You continue your way up the tower.....then you build the flag(not a sticker, NO stickers in this set!) :D  

   Then you finish it and it looks wonderful! I have it on a small desk so when I stand next to it I am pretty even with it, and it doesn't look that good, but when it is seen from a distance it looks AMAZING!


So here is a list of pros and cons:

Pros:

-TALL!
-Hard build
-NO stickers
-3rd biggest Lego set EVER! (To my knowledge)
-Takes time to build
-Bottom section, middle section, and top section can be taken apart for transport or storage.
-TON of Dark grey pieces, great for MOC's!

Cons:

-A little repetitive, not a big deal.

   This set is a GREAT set and perfect for Lego collectors and builders alike! It is a wonderful model and looks JUST like the Eiffel Tower! Here's a link to a picture: http://neatorama.cachefly.net/images/2007-07/eiffel-tower-day.jpg  See!

  So I 100% recommend you buy this set! Thanks for taking your time to read this review! :D

"jamal_lts","2009-08-11T16:23:18.797Z","High Tower","This set is stunning! I remember trying to imagine the height of this set before actually buying it and building it. So when i was done building it, its massively huge! The height, of course, was anticipated. But what i forgot to take into account is the entire volume of it (square width and length)

The build it self was challenging at the base. Carefully building it as its fragile. The engineering of it is that the four corners supports each other pushing each other in a synergy. I had a tough time building the base as it collapsed a few times. 

But once u got through the base, the rest is easy. and its also the best, when it starts to tower up higher and higher. A bit repetitive at the mid and top end but these are one of the few sets where the repetition is easy and enjoyable. And it get thinner so repetition gets faster and faster. 

I must say, this is a must have for large scale model collectors. The presence effect is stunning!! I always have it compared (height) to any kids visiting.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It doesn't include any minifigures or stickers. This set comes with 3428 pieces and this is my largest set I now own. This set will take you about a week to build.<br />

<span style=""font-weight: bold"">Features:</span><br />
<br />
There're not many features in this set. The only feature is that you can take off the second and the third platform very easily for better transport. If you build this set I would recommend you to build this one on a wooden board or on an empty box which is really sturdy.<br />

"Citizen_Piper","2011-09-05T19:57:49.423Z","an icon in any lego city","the lego eiffel tower brought me out of my dark ages, it made me start collecting again.&nbsp; Building it would be like therapy because it entails days (3 days for me) of repetitive building with bricks that are mostly of the same color.<br><br>the base is made of four separate green baseplates connected/covered by big smooth pieces that serve as its tile. This is also where the elevator lobby/s are located...it is initially wobbly until you get to build and connect the arches. By this time you will appreciate how much detail the designers have put into this set. <br><br>the second part of the build is where the observation deck is located -- lego has provided a plentiful bunch of smoked frameless windows for this purpose. At this level you will be reminded that it is less than half of what should be minifig scale -- the windows reach only half the height of minifigs.<br><br>the third and the last stretch of the build is like the icing on the cake...by this stage you will see and build a narrow elevator shaft/column that reaches the top. A very nice detail because of the bright yellow and red lifts that nicely pop up visually. a craftily done sideways build of the topmost point detail, where the french flag sits, caps the whole build.<br><br>this set deserves its own sturdy place, at almost 2 feet wide,&nbsp; 2 feet breadth and 4 feet height...it occupies a lot of space. Though it could be easily broken down into three sections...moving it should be avoided because the base could crack in half -- believe me, its not a pretty picture.<br><br>any builder below 16 deserves a pat on the back when he finishes this build. Its big and its iconic and relatively fairly priced on a per brick basis when i got it in manila. I highly recommend this set to anyone who still has a chance of getting it.&nbsp; <br><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,5
