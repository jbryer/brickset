Of course, the minifigures included aren't like these that you find with the original sets, these have a magnetic capacibility.

Like all the magnet sets, this have this cool effect, but also, like all the magnet sets, it is so much small (commonly 3 minifigures, the magnet sets don't includes more than this). The minifigures included this set are three common minifigures in the theme, a skeleton warrior, the &quot;good king&quot; (I dislike this name), and the knight general.

The skeleton warrior have black and red color schemes in the body, and a white coloured face. Unlike the skeletons from the old themes (some of the new, in themes like Indiana Jones, still being released), this have a face with red eyes. Well, this effect is to say thet they are reanimated dead warriors, but these looks like to be very silly, though. Some increasements included are the the helmet and the armor. The both are black, a good color scheme, and the armor features some details to looks like more a skeleton warrior. Also, a sword is included, but the sword isn't like the common swords of the knights, this is common among the skeleton warriors from 2007.

The knight general (or how he is called in the storyline), is well detailed, and also have some increasements, like the helmet (this is totally silver and is common among the entire castle theme), armor (the crown printed detail is unnecessary, it could be only silver), and a silver sword. Almost completely silver, the knight's face is also common among this new theme, and also in the knights kingdom playsets, as the knight Rascus). Overall about this minifigure, it is a bit better than the skeleton.

The &quot;good king&quot; (really bad name) features a blue and golden color scheme. The cover is blue and also the body, legs and armor (this armor also have unnecessary crown details wth golden parts). The face is common among some other themes, like aqua raiders, vikings and of course, castle. The crown is useful for the theme, since the first minifigures of kings were being released (an example is the king of the royal knights).

Overall, the minifigures have a cool magnet effect (altough unnecessary), have useful parts, but aren't that great (especially the skeleton and king). And don't worth buy it by &#163;5.99, this is the same price of the set &quot;Final Just&quot; from the same Castle theme, and this includes more pieces. Like several other magnet sets, this is a bit unuseful.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
