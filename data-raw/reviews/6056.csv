They have magnets in the hollow part of the figs' legs, not the bottom. I had never owned or saw LEGO minifig mags up close so I always thought the magnets were in the bottom of the feet, which would not let the figs attach to studs. I was wrong! Not only can these figs hang out on my fridge, they can also be right at home in a LEGO display. Mr. Freeze has magnets in his ice tanks on his back as well. I just checked my magfigs and it seems that you can't separate the legs from the torso. I also had trouble removing the hands from the arms. The heads come off so you can customize a tiny bit. I was hoping to be able to remove the legs so that you can mix and match them with other minifigs in your collection but it seems you can't. If the legs were interchangeable I would have scored this set a 5 but being that they are not, it received a 4, which is much better than I would have thought before I owned this set. Now I might try to buy the rest of the Batman Magnet sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
