It&#39;s just a simple keychain &ndash; but&nbsp;it&#39;s still great because it&#39;s a <em>Batman</em>&nbsp;keychain, not one of the newer <em>DC Super Heroes</em> keychains. However, after using it as a real keychain for a couple of years, it&#39;s taken a bit of a beating...</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Set:</b>&nbsp;852090 Riddler Key Chain</li>
	<li><b>Theme:</b>&nbsp;Batman</li>
	<li><b>Pieces:</b>&nbsp;5 (glued)</li>
	<li><b>Minifigures:</b>&nbsp;1</li>
	<li><b>Price:</b>&nbsp;$3.99 USD</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Keychain</h3>

<p>The hands, arms, and legs will move independently. The hands come off, and can be replaced. The legs can come off the hips, but the hips stay put glued to the torso, which in turn is glued to the head, and so on and so forth. That makes it so it couldn&#39;t be&nbsp;played with it normally, but will stay&nbsp;together on my keys for a day of work.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is a great keychain. I loved it when I bought it, and I am amazed at how it had&nbsp;stayed in perfect mint condition all those years (until I started using it). Needless to say, I&#39;ve enjoyed it the five years I&#39;ve had it. Thanks for reading my review!</p>
