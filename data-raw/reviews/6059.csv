<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only down side is that there are stickers for eyes to be placed on the blocks. Not something I'd have put in a box set like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from that, the box the blocks come in is great for storage of the Duplos after play and keeping everything all together. It is a great gift and was well recieved.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5
