"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-23T02:19:12Z","Fun Little Set!","This is an intersting set that includes (sort of) two items, a seaplane and fishing cabin. The seaplane is fine and the cabin is OK (could have included the back of the cabin. But by putting them both together into one set and throwing in 3 minifigs, Lego has done a great job! A total of 131 pcs for this little set!! This set was an airline promo set and I recommend this wholeheartedly!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Mr__Mini_Man","2011-07-04T10:42:13.723Z","Favorite Airline-promo","<p>I spent a good amount of time hunting this set down on bricklink for a good price and&nbsp;got it for $25.&nbsp; Now, before I go on about how this was $10 over the origional price, lets get into the review!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Upon un-wrapping this set from it's package,&nbsp;I found a long, thin, box... Saying specially made for airline companies! The box art is very pleasing, after being stuck with what we have today, bright, detailed, background images... That being said,&nbsp;I will point out that there are two instruction booklets, one for the plane, which is a model of a Lake Buccaneer. The other is for a nice little cabin, which has nothing on the inside to get exicted about, which DOES, leave room for modding. This set has pleasing box-art, and nice instructions. 4/5</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>All&nbsp;I can say, is very useful and&nbsp;very pleasing! I'll give a quick run-down of the noteable parts.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red I x 1V x V door</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Pine tree, II x II x IV</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red I x II x II window with fixed glass</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slope II x II with flight control pattern</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1817 sticker, with clouds, sun, and plane</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over-all, great parts. The sticker on the plane's tail is bueatiful! 5/5 for them!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>3 minifigures, all with the same smiling, glasses wearing face. The torsos included are a black shirt with yellow arms, a brown pilot jacket, and a green jacket with white arms. We get blue, white, and red baseball caps, these peing the old version. Also included is a life vest. Put together, the minifigures look lively and excited, like they just ate that delicious large mouth bass they caught while camping! 5/5</p>
<h4>The build </h4><p>Very basic build, its really throw the plates down, and build up. When building the cabin, you get many I x II profile bricks and 2 BUWPs (Big ugly wall piece).</p><p>When building the plane, you get many slanted parts, making up the fusulage, tail, and wings. The build was a quick 10 minutes for me. The canow featured&nbsp;took a quick 20 seconds.&nbsp;A fun build. 4/5</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>We get the lake buccaneer, a cabin, a canoe,&nbsp;and 3 minifigures with accesories. The build was quick and easy, and took 10 minutes as I stated earlier. 4/5</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This set has great instructions, box, minifigures, and parts. We get a great fun build that takes little to no time! Overall, 5/5! Get this NOW! If you find it for a low price, Why not?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Mini Man</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"Taggerung1","2022-08-18T09:45:48.26Z","A Nice Little Set","<p>This set encapsulates a lot of what I love about this era of Lego sets.&nbsp; It&#39;s small, nice and simple, but when I got it, it unlocked so very many little adventures.&nbsp; There were no ninja skeletons or giant dragons, and it didn&#39;t have the name of a popular movie on the box.&nbsp; Instead, I got to make my own adventures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three campers taking shelter from a storm with winds so strong it blows the plane into the hut.&nbsp; Exploring the wilderness of The Backyard National Park to find a crashed alien spaceship (6975).&nbsp; Getting mixed up in aerial one-upmanship with the far more qualified pilot in (3439). (you can tell because his window is darker blue!)</p>

<p>The number of times that seaplane has crashed, exploded, crashed and then exploded, exploded and then crashed, and has otherwise been destroyed... is beyond count.&nbsp; That said, it&#39;s still around.&nbsp; As is the boat.&nbsp; The cabin became spare parts long ago, but I could rebuild it.&nbsp; I came to find the set to review it here because I just found one of the minifigs from it (green jacket guy) hiding inside of set (7893) Passenger Jet.</p>

<p>What I like about this set is that its playability doesn&#39;t depend on having any other sets; all you need is an imagination.&nbsp; Which you have by default, unless you&#39;re told that this vehicle has to fight the skeleton dragons or battle droids or whatever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also I just found out this was a promotional airlines set?&nbsp; I ordered it out of the Lego Shop at Home catalogue in like late 2001, so that&#39;s weird I guess.&nbsp; :P</p>
