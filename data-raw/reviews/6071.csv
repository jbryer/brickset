It's quite an interesting set and the selection of minifigs is pretty mind-boggling. If you don't care for Chess this is great to beef up your Lego minifig collection. As a chess game it works tremendously well, but all the colours tend to be a tad distracting.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The minifigures count as pieces which is nice and pretty cool. It is a very good game. Now, I am waiting for Lego Monopoly!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-06-26T11:40:11.687Z","Chess","This set is one of the chess sets released, it was released yesteryear and is a part of the current castle theme. Like several of the other Lego chess sets, it includes a piece with black and white parts, it isn't very creative, is really basic and not very useful in another type of set, only in castles (as the castle floor, to big creations it is cool)or chess like this, but is very playable and of course, don't dismantle when playing with. The chess board isn't very useful to increase very sets, with few exceptions, but it is cool to play chess with this, and have a good size for Lego minifigures, the board measures 25cm X 25cm.

The minifigures included are common among the entire theme (castle from 2007-2008), and a side have the knights and the other have the skeletons. The skeleton pawns are just the black skeletons with weaponsand shields, common and useful to make an army, but the faces aren't really good. The red eyes are unnecessary, the old skeletons were so much scariest and the arms were more free to movements, the new skeletons have only arms' movements to up and down, not to sides, like the old skeleton minifigs had.

The two skeleton bishops have a cool style, are basically reapers, and the scythes are long, made with a stick and a &quot;skeleton sword&quot; (common among the skeleton warriors). These have also black covers, and a simple black and red schemes in the body, arms and legs. Again, the faces are skeletons with red eyes, but nothing scary or real like. 

The skeleton rooks are so much basic, but it is common, is basically the same of the set G577 (vikings chess set), with few differences in color and shape. The black and red pieces connect the shield with the skeleton army symbol and two spikes are connected to the sides. The same building is made with the rooks of the knights, but with gray and blue colors, and also, the knights' shield is putted in the front. The spikes aren't included in the knights' rook, these were replaced by two torches. Useful, but simple.

The knighs are also basically the same in each side (knights and skeletons), with the same basic building featuring a horse armor, but with different colors. The knights' have the common blue and gold, when the skeletons' have the black and red colors. If you don't want to use these in the chess game, it can be useful to horses in the common shape.

The bishops of the knights' side are well detailed, and their faces are the same of the vikings' king. The bodies are too common among the theme, but could be better, are very detailed, but unnecessary and unuseful with the classic knights (70's to 80's years)due to the details. The bishops also have brown covers, like some of the jedi's  covers, cool and useful. The staffs of these bishops are increased by torches.

The pawns of the king's side are the common knights of the entire theme, and are very repeated with the theme, making it useful to make a new knight army. The helmet is silver and the body is well detailed with golden details, but with more blue and silver schemes. The shields are the same of so much other knights from the current theme. The se pawns are useful to the new sets, but the classic sets had so much differences, making it unuseful to them.

The skeleton's queen is like a skeleton, but have a red hair piece and dress (completely black), and also a black cover and a staff made by a red glowing stick (the light &quot;blade&quot; of the sith), with a lightsaber piece in the top, with a diamond. The face isn't good, is another silly skeleton face.

The queen of the king's side is the same minifigure of the 7093 set (Skeleton tower), well detailed, but it have a mistake (in the castle storyline she is the princess, not the queen, something is very wrong with the set, maybe). The blue and gold colors are very common with the entire theme, making it useful to the current castle theme. The only difference between the both minifigs (from 852001 to 7093) is the face expression. A good minifigure to this current theme.

The king is the same of the 7094 set (King's castle siege), useful (only to the new themes) but not so rare, altough the golden crown, blue cover, king's armor and golden longsword aren't that easy to get. The kings of the classic castle theme were a bit of more realistic, altough simple.

The king of the skeleton side is called &quot;The Evil Wizard&quot; (I personally dislikes this silly name), with a hat, a cover (like the witches' covers) and a staff, is the same minifigure of the set 7093 (Skeleton tower).

Overall, this set is a good option to get some of the new castle theme, and to play chess with the Lego style. But it could be more increased, with armors to the knights, biggest rooks and more detailed horses, also, this set could show more classic castle characters, not just the new, and it should show more creativity with the chess board, not just a plate with different colors (the chess board is so much basic, could be increased). Currently, the price is good for this set (&#163;19.99 worth the money if you like something about the new castle theme, or just about the set). But &#163;29.99 was close to a ripoff. So, this set could be more increased, I hope the next chess will be better, this still a 4,4 of a 5 in comparison with a chess. Good try and good execution, but could be a bit better. As the description says, chess is a good game of skill and strategy, I personally like it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"keexko","2009-11-02T00:36:31.623Z","A good problem","I got this off of eBay. The seller actually used pictures of another castle chess set (knights Kingdom). He had me surprised when he sent me this chess set instead. I wanted to say that it was not as described and wanted to mark him down on the DSR (you would not get it if you do not use eBay) but, I found the set rather delightful and well, better since it matches the newer castle sets that I collect. Perfect Army builder for play & display! 5 starts out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"iamcjb","2011-01-16T15:22:08.187Z","Good chess set which is great for army building","This is the set which encouraged me to return to Lego. My girlfriend purchased me this for Christmas after I agreed to teach her the rules of chess. The minifigs are distinctive enough to easily identify the various pieces. Having the minifigs from distinctively different factions also gives this an advantage over regular sets which usually only diversify by colour. Having the pieces attached to the board also is an improvement over traditional chess boards, where I often find pieces falling over shifting their positions during movement.<div><br></div><div>The second side to this set is what it can offer to Lego collectors that are no chess players. The board is black and white chequered squares, which can act as an indoor floor to either a castle hall or a city building. Then there's the minifigs. Each side (Evil Wizard and the Crown King) gets 16 chess pieces. Four are constructed pieces designed to represent the classic knight and rook chess pieces (which include two large shields for each faction). The other 12 are actual minifigs meaning the set has a total of 24 minifig, with each side made up of the following:</div><div>8 pawns - Knights with sword and shield / Skeletons with mace and shield</div><div>2 Bishops - Ranger/thief style characters / Grim reaper looking guys with large scythe</div><div>1 Queen - Crown Princess / An evil Queen character</div><div>1 King - A King with gold grown and large sword / An evil wizard similar to Majisto</div><div>Then of course there's the rooks and knights I mentioned above.</div><div><br></div><div>Considering the prices most places are looking for 5 man battle packs, this set is a very cost effective way of starting a good and evil army.</div><div><br></div><div>In terms of downsides to this set, when playing chess the weapons can sometimes be annoying and get in the way. Other than that, there are no problems.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you buy this set for the troops, then my complaint would be that the choice of weapons is a bit poor (probably to keep the pieces generic for chess), although I think the unique main characters more than make up of this. Also if you are not a fan of the fantasy side of ""Castle"" then the evil side may be a waste.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall I think this is a great set for either a chess player or a Lego ""Castle"" fan. The minifigs look great, and although the choice of weapons is minimal, it's a good set to start an army, meaning the lack of chess knowledge doesn't ruin this set.</div>",TRUE,4,5,1,5,5
