"lego12","2008-05-12T19:01:16.687Z"," Lets move out Troops! Go Go Go! Steady Fire!"," I got this set for free at a Lego store! It is overpriced if you are planning to buy this set. It is pretty cool for your backpack. It looks really cool. It has NO playability at ALL! I mean you can move him around and play with him, but he is not meant to be played with so he has NO playability. I later gave this set to my friend as a gift and he liked it. I would not get this set unless it is on sale for a $1.00, which I highly doubt is EVER going to happen. Thanks for reading my review and I hope it helped for you to decide if you should get this set or not! :D
