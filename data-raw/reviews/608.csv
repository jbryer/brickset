The set makes a nice steam engine and carriages with car transporter at the end. The Nostalgia value alone is worth picking this set up, from the hollow black slopes to the retro instructions and dodgy coloured train track.

The Engine is well made and looks the part, the carriages are simple but effective (would benefit from doors or a hinge roof) the car transporter is poor by todays standards but it was made 35 years ago so can't be too harsh.

Comes complete with oval of track and offers endless expansion with track or buildings. Chugs along nicely even if spare rubber grips for the wheels come in at $2 a go. 

Not as good as later train sets  but a solid start.

Pros
Lovely engine, realistic colours.
3 carriages
Solid motor (still works after all these years)

Cons
No minifgs (why?)
Random coloured track

A solid four stars, my earliest lego set and one to keep for another 35 years.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
