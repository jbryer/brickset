Back then it was difficult for me to buy separate parts like Pick-A-Brick, so such canisters would come in handy.</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s this canister about?</strong><br />
Well, I would say, it&#39;s&nbsp;a classic Basic lego set, which includes a variety of large, medium and small bricks, typically found in the series. Of various colors &ndash; red, green, blue, black, yellow, white, orange, etc. and shapes. 700 pieces in total.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Possible Builds</strong><br />
5528 allows you to make various very simple figures &ndash; animals for the most part. There are no EYE bricks here however, so you create animals based on texture and form rather than exact details. As the canister pictures suggest &ndash; it&#39;s possible to make a whole zoo with an elephant, a giraffe, a gorilla and many others.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not impossible to build a house, though the set lacks any kind of windows or doors. Interestingly there are a few slopes, though not to many to create a red roof. Green and brown elements are good enough to make trees though. In any case even with this collection of bricks it&#39;s not impossible to make anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong><br />
As mentioned before &ndash; there are no limitations to this canister. You can use the bricks in any possible, yet simple variant, as all classic Lego bricks do. The combinations are endless. I still feel, this one could include some printed eyes, doors and windows, and perhaps &#39;side&#39; bricks, and even wheels, like this <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/330-1/Basic-Building-Set-3"">330</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, AFOL would find this set cute, but not challenging or useful for their creations. Small kids would enjoy such a collection to make funny things and adventures of their own.</p>

<p><strong>Some specifics</strong><br />
As this is a canister for free creativity and imagination with no boundaries, there were no instructions or any leaflets inside. This set lacks any minifigures, but allows to make characters of your own.</p>

<p>Strangely, there are only 10 different small bricks of lime color, 8 of medium blue and 2 orange mini-plates.</p>

<p>The canister itself is made of cardboard (28 cm in height, 23 cm in diameter), but the lid is of red plastic. Good enough to store large blocks, like 16x8 baseplates or rocks, walls from other sets.</p>
