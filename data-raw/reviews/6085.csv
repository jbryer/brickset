"ljames28","2008-07-26T14:59:08.187Z","Great unit","I bought this storage unit when it was on sale for &#163;17.50 so &#163;20.74 with shipping was a real bargain.

It's a painted wood unit (real wood not MDF) with 4 storage trays that slide in and out. Each storage tray has 9 compartments, 4 small, 3 medium, 2 big for holding various peices. Each compartment can hold about a 700 peice lego set excluding wheels or massive bits.

It's really good if you get a new Technic set and you need to sort out beams, pins and other various bits to make finding the parts easier. It's also good if you have a big box of assorted lego and you want to seperate out the important bits.

Overall it's highly versatile and you'll find lots of uses for it. At it's current price of &#163;10..49 I'm tempted to buy another!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Branko","2008-09-24T19:45:38.653Z","MDF, not wood","When these units were for sale I bought 4 of them (1 as a gift) and while putting the first one together I felt a mix of disappointment and satisfaction.

This is a VERY nice cabinet, made from MDF (all 4 of mine are, for sure) with a very good thick layer of paint on it that will protect it well during use. The disappointment I felt was because several people had posted comments that the unit was made from real wood, but really MDF is an excellent material for something like this.

When putting it together I immediately noticed that this was much better quality than your average IKEA furniture. The shelves themselves are sturdy and quite large with quite a few separate compartments to sort your LEGO, although I did need at least 3 units to sort through my kid's pile of LEGO. The shelves are easy to remove and put back (my 3 year old kids could do it themselves without any problem).

Pros: 
  -Build quality:
      nicely coated screws
      grooves for the back panel
      a nice LEGO logo on the side of the cabinet
      plastic feet on the bottom to prevent scratching of your floor
      high quality paint-job
  -Easy to take tray in and out of the cabinet
  -Contents of trays easily visible when in cabinet
  -Usable as a small build table when sitting on the floor

Cons:
  -MDF not real wood
  -not stackable
  -full pice is a bit high",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AndreasL","2008-10-28T23:08:02.78Z","Very sturdy and good sorting system for your Lego","We have bought 15 of these units. Most of them were bought on sale at Shop-at-home, others on eBay.<br/><br/>We use them as the main containers for nearly all the bricks we own. They are very well dimensioned and the 9 compartments in each tray can often be used very effectively when sorting the bricks.<br/><br/>It is a very high quality product. None of the 15 units have had any scratches, misaligned holes, etc.<br/><br/>The units are (obviously) stackable as opposed to what other reviewers writes.<br/><br/>Get'em if you can find'em.<br/>",TRUE,5,5,5,1,5
