All kidding aside though, it's pretty sweet looking.  There is a sort of a mining bucket conveyance system and lots of weaponry.  Tucked in the corner is a little blacksmith shop.  The only thing missing seems to be carts that actually roll away the ore (the buckets are stationary) but that can be easily made.  And we get ore (actually aquazone crystals) in gold and silver!  It's only at Target (and I am assuming later the Lego website) but is pretty detailed for $50.

This is my second set of the latest fantasy castle line.  It has been quite a while since I built it but I gotta say I still love it because I had as much fun playing it as when I built it.

Okay, now pros and cons
pros
- Everything works perfectly well including the catapult, the rail and the carts, the two buckets on different transportation systems. Two thumbs up for all these well-designed details!
- Not too many technic-pin-connected parts so that the whole building is structurally sturdy.
- Great color theme with all the brown, green and grey bricks.
- Cute little gold and silver ores.
- Fair number of minifigs (2 orcs, 4 dwarves and 1 ogre) although I would not mind if there were more lol.
- Good amount of armors and weapons.
- Diversity in helmets and beards of dwarves.
- Good value for money for 500 something bricks.
cons
- Wrong helmets on orcs.  Was it just me because I think this kind of helmets are for the skeletons.

For the castle fans, it is a definite purchase because it is pretty much a flawless set. 

p.s. My first review in here and hopefully it is of help to some of you.

"the_lead_general","2008-11-25T16:16:36.903Z","New ideas","Dwarves' mine

Plus+
     lots of new minifigures! Golden helmeted dwarvish king, dwarvish prince/warrior, blacksmith, miner, 2 troll warriors and a giant troll. The number is outstanding! The forge is cool and I love the anvil. The train tracks are long which is unusual. Unusual but good! The devices for transporting the gold and silver around are devious. The meals area and fire-place are helpful in making the scene as is the big doors. The chicken drumsticks and golden goblets make it a much better set. The 4 gold pieces and 4 silver pieces are much more than you would expect and there is a ruby. The price is very good and it is usually cheaper than $70 in Australia. The trucks are cool and hold a lot of pieces of gold each. It comes with three barrels and you only need one. so used the others elsewhere. The amount of tools is amazing. There are three battle-axes, two picks, a spade, a war-hammer, a hammer and three shields. There are lots of imaginative place to put the spair bits. The green slopy thing goes on top near it's friends. Also it comes with a helmet, a breastplate, and a sword. 

Minus-
      The giant troll is brown and doesn't look very good. He comes with a club though. The trolls have bronze swords and silly helmets, I like the other ones better. There is a gap in transportation between where they haul the gems from the mine up (then where).The table in the meals area should have a circular rim to extend it to a table from a stool. The mine is hidden behind the blacksmith's shop and is very empty. The catapult is functional but looks silly. It could have a bigger mine in it because where do the carts go to?

Equals=
       This a very different set to most of the sets in the castle line and has no main weapon. It has no other sets like it ever. There have been other castles but no other mines. It is very cheep and extremely good value for money. The pluses easily outweigh the minuses and altogether it is a great set.

Compatibility
             This set needs a larger circular table in the dining room. So buy a good wizard and use the circular piece, it doesn't ruin the crystal ball. Also the dwarves mine defender is a must and Tower raid also goes well. Most sets are great to buy with it and it is very good compatibility wise. 

You start by building the figures and carts. Then you build the middle section of the mine where the throne is. Then you build the mine section on the right and finally the left section. But you still have to add certain bits after-wards and that is why it comes with two instructions.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Paradosis","2009-06-16T01:59:20.077Z","An Enigma To Me","This set is very popular in the Lego community, and to be quite honest I'm not exactly sure that I fully see the appeal. Don't get me wrong, I agree that it has overall a nice design, and has lots of play features, it just seems to be lacking something to me, though I can't put my finger on what exactly.

First, the positives. The set does have some larger pieces, but thankfully it's mostly brick built. It has a nice brown, light grey and dark grey color scheme, with green and black accents. I really like the brick-built mining carts, which have a very nice design. There are lots of nice little details, such as lots of mining elements, an anvil, helmets, armor and axes, a throne, a fire, torches, and a brick-built hammer. There is a contraption for pulling up mining materials to different levels, for transporting mining materials from the back to the front (and vice versa), and a place for sliding them down a shoot into mining cars. There are seven minifigures (4 dwarves, 2 orcs, 1 troll) in this set, which is a nice amount for a set this size and price. I think that the dwarves are especially nicely done. And one last positive is that there is lots of railing to push the mining carts along.

And then there are the shortcomings, in my opinion. The set uses ladders to get to some areas, but not all areas can be reached by ladders, leaving you with the need to make huge leaps while playing to access some areas. While I like the catapult from a design perspective, and not a big fan of it from a play perspective. The set isn't built on a baseplate, but rather on plates, which would be more acceptable if it were more easily able to be rearranged. The doors don't extend to the ground, which I'm not a fan of, though that's a minor gripe. And finally, while there is a nice variety of helmets and lots of axes, a few more shields wouldn't have hurt.

In the end I'd recommend this set, but not whole-heartedly. I would have liked to have seen a slightly better price point with this one, or... I dunno, just something else that I can't quite explain. I'd say it's a good set, just not a great or classic set.  I'd give the set a 76/100.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Lint","2010-03-06T04:17:29.31Z","Oozing with dwarfish character","<p>At first glance the Dwarve's Mine looks lacklustre especially given it's price point which is why its taken me about 2 years to finally buy it. Once you get round to building and interacting with this set you will begin to realise that it is oozing with dwarfy charm. </p>
<p>The set consists of three main towers. The left tower houses a crib room/mess area and has a gigantic lava rock catapult on top which fires exceptionally well, the central tower is comprised of&nbsp; the main mine doors, the dwarf supervisor/king's lookout and a rocky spire. The Third tower is a mine shaft which houses a bucket elevator which is operated by a giant wheel. Running through and about these these three adjoined towers is the mining system which consists of a long set of tracks, a cart hopper and a dump slide. In addition to this is a space out front in which the blacksmith uses the ore to make weapons tools and armour.</p>
<p><b>PROS</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Oozing with dwarfish charm. The colours, architecture, fire, axes, blacksmith and abundance of shiny objects really add dwarfish character to this set.</li>
    <li>Interesting to build, not dull at all. A lot of useful castle construction pieces.</li>
    <li>Lots of entertaining gimmicks, the bucket elevator, giant doors, mine cart railway system, overhead rail mounted bucket, ore slide and catapult all work without flaw and are fun to play with. Playability of this set is awesome.</li>
    <li>An ABUNDANCE of weapons, tools and armour. Most of which and shiny. Three shields, three greataxes, two normal axes, two mining picks, a hammer, a war mallet, a sword, two troll scimitars, one troll shield, two pewter evil 'skelly' helms, one golden winged helm, one silver winged helm, one copper dwarf helm, one silver dwarf helm, one knight's grilled helm, one knight silver armour and a giant troll club!. Hope I didn't miss anything.</li>
    <li>Lots of accessories, shiny ore, goblets, barrels, torches etc</li>
    <li>You get a copper/brown giant troll! And two regular trolls which is a more respectable 'enemy' force than most other sets give you.</li>
    <li>I really love the build of the blacksmiths anvil. I prefer when objects are built out of common pieces instead of single piece molds.</li>
    <li>Quite solid, no problems picking up the set and moving it unless you're careless.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>CONS</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>A cool as the gimmicks are, the mining system doesn't make much sense at all. The overhead bucket dumps ore into both the mine cart hopper and the slide. I would have preferred a clearer flowing process where ore is elevated out of the shaft, transferred into the rail bucket then dumped into the hopper which loads the cart. Education value = zero.</li>
    <li>I know they're meant to be short but the unarticulated dwarf legs make me sad.</li>
    <li>Full RRP is very discouraging</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary I would say this is a must get for Castle collectors and a great gift for kids. Even if you're not you get a ton of cool weapons, parts and accessories. It's definitely got more playability and character than the wizards skull tower.</p>

"legoDad42","2010-01-18T22:30:11.28Z","FANTASTIC CASTLE SET!","Just a fabulous Castle Set from Lego the Dwarves' Mine is. Plenty of fun, cool play features and a nice enjoyable build with good details throughout. It's designed to be a Castle and quarry for the Dwarf King built out of a mountain-side. The King's Throne room overlooks his Dwarven subjects from his miners, to a black-smith and a rail system which runs through the Castle. Just FANTASTIC! 

CENTER SECTION - 2 large double doors (which open and close) with gold details (nicely designed), King's Throne Room with throne and two shields adorning the front of the balcony left and right, King mini-figure with gold winged helmet/gold goblet/red gem, above the throne room outside are two battle axes(copper colored) and then atop you see part of the mountain with 2 torches left and right. 

RIGHT SECTION - Atop you have a working wheel/pulley system that hooks to a bucket and runs 3 levels top to bottom (top is where the large wheel is with ladder out front/2nd level un-adorned with a ladder out front/1st level is a quarry (cave) where a Dwarf miner can be working (Dwarf miner mini-figure has a pick-axe and copper helmet). The set comes with gold and silver ore so you can set up the cave with this and have the Dwarves dig them out and place them into the bucket or carry over to the rail section. 
Now in front of the quarry we have a neat little black-smith's work station. Comes with black anvil, 2 barrels to hold weapons, a large hammer and also a silver breast plate and helmet. Dwarf Black-Smith mini-fig. has a black hammer and silver helmet. 

LEFT SECTION - Atop this section is a large catapault (nicely designed) with a large bolder detailed to be aflame (snap down on the front of it to send the boulder soaring. Good distance you can get on this). 2nd level is unadorned but a wench system runs through it. 1st level out front has a slide for the ore (but I rather see this as a pretend conveyer belt actually). Now at the 1st level behind, we have a nice area where the Dwarf's take a break from their work. In here we have a small black fireplace with red coals burning, a barrel with a large chicken(or turkey)leg, and a small table with a gold goblet. 

RAIL SYSTEM - Another great play feature. This rail runs through the front and back of the castle. Comes with 2 mine carts that tilt left and right to empty ore(nicely designed). The rail runs through the double doors and towards the back is another section that has a small tower with ladder. Atop this is a curved wench system with a bucket you can slide from the tower to the left of the castle through the 2nd level to dump ore onto the slide/coveyer belt. This bucket/wench system also can dump ore through the back small tower onto awaiting mine carts which then can also bring ore to the front of the castle. Might seem limited but provides a fun play feature to keep your Dwarves busy as well as your child's imagination. Also at the bottom near the conveyer belt/slide is a mount to hold a tool (hammer, pick axe, weapon, etc.) 

This set also comes with a Dwarf warrior with silver winged helmet, shield and battle axe. A large Cave Troll figure with spikes atop head and back and large stone club plus 2 Troll warriors, one with shield and both with copper colored swords. 

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this set for it's playability, details, fun rail sytem, multiple levels and great mini-figures. Young and old alike will enjoy this Castle set immensely. Might be the best of the Castle kits from Lego the past 2 years or so. 
Final note, this build is for your 7 year old on up. Can use help on this at certain stages. Not a difficult build but just make sure all things are tight and lined up properly.

"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-24T14:15:01.34Z","It's all mine. ","<p>Ask me what the greatest faction to ever come out of Castle is and I will point towards Fantasy Era's Dwarves; specifically, I will point precisely at Dwarves' Mine because I think it's possibly among the best sets ever released for the Castle line, save perhaps for the famous Royal Knights' Castle (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6090-1"">6090</a>) and other popular choices for Castle's top spot. To me, the greatness of Dwarves' Mine stems from it being a perfect combination of the best of any LEGO set: it's unique without being weird, it's aesthetically coherent, it's got a ton of playability but without being ""kiddish"", and it's got an absolutely fantastic selection of Minifigs that are bound to please any fantasy fan. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A generous selection of seven Minifigs populates the mine, though, unlike the haphazard crew that comes with Drawbridge Defense (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7079-1"">7079</a>), the Minifig selection here is logical and pretty much what you'd expect. Four Dwarves work the mine, and the varied&nbsp;selection of&nbsp;beards, helmets, and torso pieces means that you're sure to find&nbsp;unique roles for all of them and won't feel any sense of repetition. Inevitably, you'll feel compelled to pick up the Dwarf Warrior Battle Pack (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=852702-1"">852702</a>)&nbsp;- provided you're able to sell a kidney to raise the cash for one - but by no means will you feel shortchanged by the Dwarves included in this set. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Antagonising the Dwarves are a pair of Troll goons who, curiously, are sporting ""Undead""-style helmets as opposed to the usual Troll ones that most of their other comrades are wearing, but I suppose a bit of variety is not to be despised. Backing the Troll invasion is a much-coveted Giant Troll. I can't say I particularly care for this colour scheme, but it's not offensive, and hey, it's a Giant Troll. An early precursor to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/?m=lor027"">Cave Troll</a>, perhaps? Who can tell?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There's no secondary build here: you get a huge mine and that's it, and that is by no means a bad thing. The build is loosely divided into three different sections: the central section where the large doors are, and the two stone columns on the left and the right. I say ""loosely divided"" because while all the sections connect together via Technic pins in a usual fashion, the mine doesn't really have the modularity that, say, Trolls' Mountain Fortress (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7097-1"">7097</a>) has, in&nbsp;the sense that one is free to rearrange sections to suit one's fancy as in the latter case. There's really only one way to put this bad boy together, and you're looking at it. The reason for this unusual rigidity (for a large Castle set, anyway)&nbsp;is due to the intricate interconnectedness of the various components of the mine. The various parts obviously do not function together in a 100% logical way, but the whole point of LEGO is to use one's imagination a little bit, right? </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We'll consider the set from right to left, with ""right"" referring to when the front doors are facing us, as in the main BrickSet picture. This part is probably the one most divorced from the rest of the set and could conceivably stand by itself for display purposes, since, I suppose, it's meant to represent a mine shaft that brings to the surface whatever it is the Dwarves are digging for. The big wheel makes for a really cool mechanism, although the string can be a little fiddly at first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the centre is the visual nexus of the whole design: overlarge double-doors for the mine carts and the ""throne"" upon which the Dwarf Lord oversees the day-to-day operations, or whatever it is Dwarf Lords do. The reliance on a BURP&nbsp;to add mass to the&nbsp;top of the throne is slightly unfortunate, but the set up, on the whole, looks amazing and suitably fantastic that it distinguishes itself from any other Castle motif thus far. The dark blue/pearl gold colour scheme&nbsp;alludes to the&nbsp;Crown Knights, giving the&nbsp;suggestion that the two factions are allies; this is further corroborated by the work of the blacksmith near the front of the set, designing helmets and armour on a cute anvil that could not possibly be worn by Dwarves. This is a great bit of thematic continuity that works all the better if you have a couple of Crown Knights to visit with the Dwarves. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of things are then packed into the stone column on the left, the base of which is a sort of lounge area for the Dwarves, if you will. The fireplace and table are humanising (Dwarf-ising?) aspects to the mine that make in seem that much more ""livable"". Of course, the contrast here is that this Dwarvish lounge is housed right beneath a comically large catapult that, sadly, cannot be operated via the&nbsp;wheels attached to the sides. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What remains hidden by all of the pictures of this set is what's behind the mountain facade, and what lies behind is actually pretty significant. A track is connected that runs through the front doors and to the back, where there is a kind of sorting tower or something where the Dwarves can pick up the crystals they want and put them into a basket that connects the back to the front with a bendy piece that the basket runs along. The basket then dumps the crystals into a chute in the front&nbsp;which, um, returns the crystals back to the mine carts and through the doors again, which makes the purpose of this loop a little mysterious, but whatever: it's still cool. It gives the mine a lot of fun playability, even if the mechanism isn't entirely sensible. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The whole package amounts to a coherent Dwarvish ""base"" that serves a number of functions, and it's honestly difficult to find a set comparable to this one, either in terms of theme or what it sought to accomplish. This is an absolute must-have for any fan of fantasy LEGO and definitely among the best sets released in recent memory. My advice? Make this mine yours. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

<p><strong>Initial impressions:</strong> This was one of many sets in a massive unsorted Lego bin.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was excited to find a large castle set.&nbsp; I generally prefer self contained structures (a fully enclosed building, a complete ship) so I was worried that this model would feel one-sided and a bit loose.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building experience:</strong> I built the model while watching TV.&nbsp; The minifigures look great, and the two rail cars used the car door coponents in a wonderfully unorthodox way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the&nbsp;beginning of the mine construction was boring and uninspired.&nbsp; Lots of big pieces to make it big with fewer bricks.&nbsp; The model started to gain some presence once I finished the second tower and attached them together.&nbsp; The construction of the rock-launching catapult was interesting, and the addition of the train tracks gives the model a sense of completion.&nbsp; I like the details which include the curved pipe which the bucket slides on, the ramp and the integration with the rail cars.</p>

<p><strong>Finished Model:</strong> The model comes together better than I expected. &nbsp;The model is a bit wobbly since it is built out of several modules, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend moving it a lot. &nbsp;The overall design is a bit &quot;loose&quot;, without that much continuity between the areas. &nbsp;I don&#39;t generally prefer play-oriented models, but this one has lots of interactive areas to make it pretty interesting. Definitely more interactive and complex than the castle sets from the early 90&#39;s which I grew us with.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> 7/10 on a 10-point scale. Good minifigures,&nbsp;a perfectly good set, nice play features, although the overall design lacks substance.</p>

<p><em><strong>Using the instructions, this model took a little over an hour to complete.</strong></em></p>

<p>The instructions are mostly easy to read but they made the brown peices more dark than they should.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are many interesting parts in this set like the wheel that is used to turn. The rock is rare. There are also many use full peices for your own designs. I love the axes and gold. On of the parts that I didn&#39;t like was the Line that the basket slides on this set is one of the olny things you&#39;ll use it for.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I loved the giant troll he is very nice to have. The dwarfs have a good design and I like there mini legs even tho they don&#39;t bend. The trolls also are pretty good and are fun to play with.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build isn&#39;t way to challenging but has some fun parts to it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I love the many play features on this set including the carts,catapult, the shoot and the wheel thing. It&#39;s easy to fit the dwarfs in most the areas. The castle also has good details. On the sides you could make your own add ons.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a great set has many great play features and peices.</p>
