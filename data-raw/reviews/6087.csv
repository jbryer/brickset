"BRICK_101","2008-06-15T00:47:16.967Z","Very unplayable","I got this set because it was 50% off at my local Lego store. Even at that price, I'm not sure it was a good buy. The little yellow mech is cool and well made, but the big walker is just sloppy. The leg don't articulate and fall off very easily. The design is also nothing spectacular. The little good guy ship is okay. I mostly got this for the robot figures. I wish I had gotten a couple 8115's instead.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Captain","2008-09-26T19:02:38.84Z","The       itself is lacking, but if you scrap it for parts it's better.","The walker: While it looks cool at first, the construction on the main walker is kind of bad. The legs don't move except for the front two, and their articulation is very limited. I thought it was cool that there was a small prison cell on board, and that the launching turret comes with 2 missiles for re-loading. The turret's kind of cool also, so it's okay.

The Yellow Mech: This was probably the best part of the set. It looks pretty cool and has claws and 6 missiles. That means you get lots of those little 1x1 cylinders with fins. I also like the un-orthodox leg construction.

The Flyer: It's just a few technic pieces built around the launcher. It's really nothing special, but it has cool golden stickers.

Overall: The      s for this set are not quite satisfactory, so it might be more useful to just take it apart and use the pieces. I disassembled mine, and used all the great parts. That's the main reason I'm giving this a 4.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard&nbsp;exo-force&nbsp;instructions for the time, nothing unique.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>An assortment of black and yellow parts, but nothing amazing other than a piece which lego&nbsp;refers to as a fenderbender&nbsp;1x1x2. Look it up, and you&#39;ll see how weird it is.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One red chested silver drone, one copper colored drone. Ryo sports a green outfit&nbsp;and purple hair, which actually look okay together. The best one is&nbsp;the silver-red drone, IMO.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty fun, but at points it is a little repetitive in certain parts, like the legs.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is big and impressive, but I wish the mech was black or grey so it blended in more. It is also unfortunate that only the front two legs move. I don&#39;t think this will matter to kids, as they will be just lifting it across the room. The play feature of the mech&nbsp;coming&nbsp;off is awesome, and both Ryo&#39;s&nbsp;vehicle and the crawler feature firing guns. You can also detain Ryo in a prison cell in the crawler, which is cool.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this will be a great set for kids, as with all the play features it makes for a cool battle. Not as great a display piece, as you can&#39;t do anything to make it look like this Crawler is... well, crawling. And if you take&nbsp;the mech&nbsp;off, an ugly black rod protrudes very far from his back. Overall, good for kids, bad for collectors.</p>

"Shepp","2012-09-19T10:12:07.62Z","Some missed potential, but overall okay","This set was probably the last one I purchased in the Exo-Force line. It was hard to find, and in many cases wasn't even listed in the series.<br><br>All that aside, I find this is a neat set. The combined mech and crawler idea is great. The execution falls a little short of expectations.<br><br>First, the set really needed articulated legs. Probably ratchet action, because of the weight of the crawler.<br><br>I mainly see the crawler now as a mobile heavy gun platform towed by the yellow mech rather than its own vehicle. Which is fine in itself, but really deserved to be more.<br><br>The yellow mech (Iron Condor II) is the best part of the whole set, and perfect to go up against Hayato's blue mech from the Aero Booster set.<br><br>And really that's all this set is supposed to be, the Robot equivalent of Aero Booster, but land based.<br><br>As for Ryo's little ""vehicle"", well I think they just needed an excuse to put a named character in the set, and to have someone you can place into the crawler's prison. I'd rather harvest his vehicle for parts and incorporate them into the crawler or make a hand held weapon for the yellow mech.<br><br>Really good set to harvest for parts (especially the cannon, pop that sucker onto something else as is) or alter into a better crawler.<br><br>Essential to complete the Exo-Force line, but I'd say a pass for younger children. There are much more playable sets in the line.<br>",TRUE,3,3,4,2,4
