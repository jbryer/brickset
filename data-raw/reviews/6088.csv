I have to say I was a little disappointed that it is not really very accurate in terms of correct wheels etc, and it looks like a customised racing truck rather than anything you are likely to see thundering down the interstate, as It does have a low-slung aggressive look to it.

As this is a creator set, it seems compromises have been made on the parts and details so the pieces can be used to make other things. I liked the engine detail, but the tilting hood should really incorporate the fenders too. The exhaust stacks are in grey, yet I know they do chrome ones, so why not include those in the set as we all know how those owner operators and racers like their shiny chrome stacks - so despite my title the “Chrome Shop Mafia” have clearly not been at work on this baby. Also why are the fenders and bottom details in black? – they would look better in red to match the rest of the body. The 5th Wheel also seems over large with a grey brick in the middle (why?) that should be black to match the rest. Top of the cab lacks detail with binoculars and lamp holder bricks supposed to represent the air horn and light combo. Construction of the chassis is quite flimsy and mine broke apart several times during construction, and when finished it is still not very sturdy.

If you want an accurate truck, a MOC will do a better job, but for a creator set that is intended to be broken up and made into other things it is not bad. I would have preferred more accuracy and better build quality, but no doubt the price would be more. I can’t fault it for price at 20 GBP, but I see our U.S. cousins can get it for 30 USD (equivalent 15 GBP) so once again we in the U.K. are paying too much!

"lego12","2008-04-24T16:34:10.013Z","  BIG Truck...."," This Creator truck is even BIGGER than it looks on the front of the box. The name of the truck (Big Rig) fits the description of the truck perfectly, considering the fact that it is BIG....containing 550 pieces. This truck can convert into 3 other models which are a Go-Cart, a Semi, and a Convertible. The Convertible and the Semi's doors can open and close. The Semi has adjustible mirrors and the front lifts up to see the REALLY detailed engine. The color red was a nice color to choose because it looks great on all 3 models. Thanks for taking the time to read this review and I hope it helped.

"Paradosis","2009-06-16T01:47:17.827Z","Not Great, But Pretty Good","This set is another of the Creator sets that has a lot of value and fun. The primary model is a big rig, which has quite a nice design, and includes details such as an engine, seats, gearshift, steering wheel, side mirrors, working doors, and a working hood. And with this main model it's tempting to think what it'd be like to have a trailer to pull with the truck (good inspiration for a MOC). The other two models (a kart and car), while not as nice as the big rig, are still pretty good. The color scheme is predominantly red, black and dark grey, and looks quite good. There are accent colors of tan and light grey. The designs are not really that blocky, but are pretty realistic. This set is definitely worth the price, in my opinion. It's a great parts pack, and you get instructions for three solid models to build. I'd give the set an 82/100.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2019-03-20T00:03:11.95Z","Heavy Fuel","<p>The Creator theme releases models of any theme it wants but you are almost always guaranteed a quality build, model and alternative designs too which is why it is continually popular. The theme took a few years to get going but was more established by 2007 when this monster arrived. Its big, red, shiny and displaying a multitude of features and components instantly recognisable&nbsp;on a &#39;semi&nbsp;truck&#39; or &#39;tractor unit&#39;. This made it a highly attractive and&nbsp;a &#39;must have&#39; for many.</p>

<p>First just to cover the other builds, you will find the car&nbsp;very solid (particularly the doors)&nbsp;and complete. Riddled with studs I hope it does not offend those who see such bumps as &#39;<em>so</em> 1970&#39;s&#39;. It&#39;s a very broad open top speedster, not bad either. The chunky wing mirrors are a nice touch and it is pretty comprehensive and an enjoyable build but it&#39;s not a patch on the truck. Perhaps instead you fancy a go-kart?&nbsp;Well you would probably enjoy building the amazing engine, it is so detailed. The design is near perfect with a chunky seat, pedals&nbsp;and bodywork but it&#39;s not the red truck cab either. Nothing really distracts from the main feature unless you love go-karts or open top sports cars.</p>

<p>Technic sturdiness makes for a good frame in the &#39;Big Rig&#39; but sometimes in Creator sets of this size you notice strange choices of brick that enable&nbsp;the alternative builds. For example why have two beams joined together to make other&nbsp;designs possible one long beam would work strongly. Obviously the build is a joy. You get loads of layering and strengthening before fuel tanks materialise&nbsp;with buttons and all the&nbsp;gubbins, fifth wheel slider - even ready to take a locking pin from a trailer you may build. The whole concept here makes for&nbsp;great constructing&nbsp;but the parts in this set in&nbsp;general are excellent, as an inventory providing the enjoyable build. Some choices, again are a little weak such as one&nbsp;stud cylinders to make the exhausts with their swingable top pipes or the swinging&nbsp;wing mirrors and the doors that could have done with one more hinge. However these are all well built and fun to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The engine is a major highlight with a satisfying covering and bonnet. The dashboard is fine and the interior also with hinged seats and the fat steering wheel yet more detail may have been possible here. The grill is a crowning front and the design achieved overall is so accurate to a Peterbilt or the like that it is a credit to the time taken by designers to get it so right. The finished model is very complete; the&nbsp;horns, speaker, aerial, grills, lights and cylinders (I am sorry to say I am unaware of the purpose yet, air brakes?). With its massive tyres&nbsp;and imposing shape there is not much to pick fault at with this&nbsp;vehicle.</p>

<p><b>Long Distance Haulage</b><br />
Always far too interested in scale, I decided this was a definite minifigure buy. Far too big as an ordinary truck for Lego people it suits best&nbsp;as a giant logging tractor unit from the Canadian forests that I was lucky enough to ride in once. It had many many gears and mandatory ear protection in cab. For minifigures&nbsp;this model is clearly also amusing. Obviously&nbsp;the seats and steering wheel are comical- you can imagine&nbsp;them fighting over it.&nbsp;I can fault a few weaknesses in this set (have fun keeping&nbsp;those aerials on) but it otherwise fulfilled all expectations. It remains one of the best models seen in the whole Creator range.</p>
