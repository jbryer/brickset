"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-08-02T14:04:25.207Z","Best One","This is the best Play set ever! Look at all the Cordak ammo, squid , and the cordak blaster! It comes with two sea creatures! I like how they used Mantex's head for one! The Toa Undersea patrol is awesome! It's heavily armored! Cordak blasters are awesome! You should really get this set!
