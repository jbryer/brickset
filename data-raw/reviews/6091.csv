"Arkahn","2008-02-10T22:22:49.81Z","an excellent addition.","This set is probably by far one of the better bionicle playsets.

Pros:
minifig scale
lots of Bionicle parts
10 bionicle minifigs
Squids, spheres and cordak

cons:
dont step on it, it will break
the sea creatures get boring but thats okay for MOCers
the spheres seem to fall out often

I hope this has helped someone in the decision of buying this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

(I don't know cause she doesn't live with me.)I read the reiviews and by the sound of it, it looks good. My mom said it was either the biggest or second biggest she saw at toys r us.

it will look awesome! i like how it has three segments. i like how it includes two animals- because they have real Bionicle masks instead of just normal masks. now for the cons: it seems a teeny bit overpriced. it should have some animals for the toa besides the terrain crawler, because the barraki have animals also.

"Marin_S_","2009-05-30T13:28:45.28Z","Great Bionicle/System mesh","I love it. It's my second Bionicle set. I've got 8947 Radiak but I don't like it, just like the rest of the standard Bionicle sets.
But these playsets are awesome, especially TTC! I like the weapons and the Bionicle pieces You don't get in System sets. I would, and have, recommended it to all System lovers who have a ""fear"" of Bionicle.
