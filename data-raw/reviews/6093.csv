Magic Box is a menu in a fast food restaurant named Quick (in Belgium) and this LEGO set can only be obtained in Belgium when you go to Quick and buy a Magic Box.

It contains very nice parts and is a great addition to every Lego City of 2007!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Anyway, a nice little set, with plenty of useful bits, woo, a dark red dish :) a girl minifig is a nice change and the jet ski is nicely made also.

a precusor for the new 2008 rescue team sets maybe?

Anyway, this set made eating all those burgers worth it, maybe i should have got some more ? :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It is good for a Lego beach. The lifeguard minifigure is cool too. This is the best promo set by far!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
