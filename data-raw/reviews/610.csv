It is nicely constructed with some nice features, however in terms of realism this set is not so good. There are no controls for operating the sub and there are so many &quot;holes&quot; in the submarine it is anything but water tight. For me that was a negative but for others it may not be an issue at all.

"Blade","2008-01-17T00:40:03.81Z","The Hidden Claw!","This set is very special for me because I was such a big fan of the series and this particular model never appeared in any of my actual LEGO catalogues. It was only by chance that I spotted it in a pre-Christmas sale catalogue from Toyworld. Surprisingly Santa was able to add it to his list for me upon seeing how excited I was. The other strange thing about this model is it's number. All of the main Aquazone models appear in the 6000's but this and Paravane (1749) come in the 1000's. Just an observation.

The model itself is a wicked style of submarine. It's got everything an Aquanaut would want. On one side of the model it has moveable arm to collect boxes and bring boxes to crystals. The arm is equiped with a harpoon gun for defence and has a spare pair of flippers on it for the team. The magnet on the end of the arm allows it to pick the boxes quite easily in play.

On the other side on the sub it has a flat triangular platform and blower. It doesn't look like much but the triangular platform in front of the blower splits in half to  reveal a set of jaws with teeth. The jaws can be operated by pushing and releasing a block behind the blower. This is quite a cool thing as it is well disguised but could fall apart if you are too rough.

The cockpit is quite cool with its big neon blue looking dome. The dome splits in half and opens up to allow access to the driver. The real let down with this is he has no controls to steer the sub with, no computer, nothing! On either side of the cockpit are to doors which fold down to reveal two compartments. The one on the left is for the crystal box and it can be easily reached by the magnet arm. The one on the right is a place to store the crystals one safely inside the ship so the box can continue to be used. On top of each door is a spear to be used if necessary. 
NOTE: This set comes with the box and crystal, which goes in the box!

The back of the vehicle is quite good also with good shape, three propellers, a gate that opens to let in the Aquanauts when they need to get back in and it also has a compass on the top. The compass moves but doesn't actually work. It would be nice if it did but this is only LEGO.

The sub also comes with a small Aqua scooter consisting of a whole nine pieces. The little scooter has its own mini-fig and is great for doing repairs of helping collect the crystals. The scooter has an arrow on the font and a peg at the back for the fig's flippers. The other two accessories that rack up this models playability are the standard one piece, black octopus and the green and red bush.

There are two mini-figs for this model. The driver of the sub is dressed in the standard Aquanauts blue outfit with black sleeves, white helmet and neon blue face shield. The face is the standard Aquanaut face with a smile, freckles and a headband. The driver of the scooter is in identical dress except for his face shield is black. His face is the red hair, smile and green sunglasses. Both are equiped with a pair of knives.

Overall allot of thought and detail went into this model. It really has allot going for it and cant understand why it wasn't one of the main models in he series. The model has NO stickers and no real flaws, just the few points I made above. I feel this model is a 9.5/10 as its really good but the lack of controls on both models can't go unacknowledged. A must have for any LEGO fan. This model is everything in aesthetics and playability.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-22T15:34:24.467Z","Cool sub, but some slight problems","This set is a 5/5 but it has a few cons that take the 5 luster away. To start the set is cool, really cool (but obviously not as cool as its counterpart). The details on this sub are awesome. The parts used to rotate the arm are unique, especially since it could have been done easier, but wasn't, which is cool. The claw is spectacular and the sytem that moves it is ingenious, up there with the LEGO technical marvels like the Spy Trak's turning system. The cockpit is cool, especially with the minisub. The triad of propellors ads a neat touch and give it that space-aged touch. The ladder in back is a cool way to seal the ship, but there isn't much room for the second diver, a similar flaw to the Star Hawk II from Unitron; it goes to show you can't just throw in a second minifigure and have nowhere for him to go! The crystal and box along with the plant and octopus add some scenery, while the side compartments are cool and the angle they make is almost unique to LEGO, since most everything is always angled specifically, with the exception of hinges. The sets at which a hinged panel rests above or below normal have an added detail. All in all a great set, if the cockpit weren't open from the compartments. Too bad it wasn't a full release, though...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
