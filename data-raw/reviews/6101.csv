"AndreasL","2009-07-04T05:57:24.7Z","Super Duplo set for young boys","This set comes with two new Duplo boat designs. A very large twin-engine police boat (not shown in the Brickset image) and a small boat for the thief to use (shown in the image). Both boats are made to float and thus they come pre-assembled. Besides the boats the set includes two police officers and a thief minifigure.
An okay selection of different bricks are included also. These can be used for a light tower or something else.

The set offers a lot of playability with the police chasing thief scenario. Both our three year old and six year old boys have played with it a lot.

Pros:
- Great boats.
- Good selection of bricks to build your own stuff.
- Nice minifigures.

Cons:
- Unable to fit thief in police boat storage when the police has captured him.
- Red briefcase does not fit the hands of the minifigures very well.
- A little expensive if you cannot get it on sale.

Overall:
- One of the greatest Duplo sets out there for boys looking for action.
