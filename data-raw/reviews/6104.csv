He's a big fun of construction site toys in general and has various toy diggers, mixers, cranes etc. But the one he loves most is this large Duplo digger.&nbsp;Something about the range of movement available seems to really appeal. He sets up a pile of 2x2 bricks and transfers them in the bucket from one pile to another.&nbsp;He also enjoys seating a Duplo figure at the controls, and hiding tools in the compartment in the back.<div><br></div><div>It's composed of &nbsp;a few large custom parts, with limited opportunity to attach to other parts, which is a shame. I'd love to attach the caterpillar tracked base to a different Duplo top, but this is not possible.&nbsp;Sadly, the centre joint soon lost it's grip, so there's not quite enough strength to keep it extended, meaning the arm goes a little floppy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Still, I'd be happy to recommend this set to any parents of digger-mad toddlers.</div><div><div><br></div><div><br><div><div><br></div></div></div></div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
