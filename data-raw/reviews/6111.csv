But when I finished it 3 hours later ( I'm a slow builder) it was quite sturdy and ... it moved perfectly.. Its head swings from side to side and ... yeah it reallly moves just like in te movies.

But it is not to scale, every snowspeeder I have got(and I have all) is a little bit to big... or the AT AT is to small... well it doesn't bother me, I now can recreate the battle of hoth with two AT AT's multiple snowspeeders and a rebel base. The only thing these sets lack is snowtroopers and rebelhoth troopers

What makes this set so awesome?
- challenging to build
- more than 1100 pieces
- walks great when you have been careful while building this set*
- nice assortment of minifigures
- it looks great when it is ready
- the motorised walking is an excellent idea and makes this set outstanding

*If you have problems to get this thing walking, stop the motor and check all positions before you kill the engine. It is very important to have the four thingys in the right position like shown on page 34 in booklet one. Also be careful when you mount the four legs to the AT-AT.

Surely this is not one of the cheaper Lego sets but this is really worth the money.

This model is pure technic, and walks with an ingenious system. Yo MUST be careful when building: the legs must be in the exact same position as in the instructions. Otherwise it will not walk.

-it has an AT-AT pilot, luke, a snowtrooper, and an all new general veers!

-hard to build. pay close attention to the instructions.

"quin1974","2009-07-26T16:07:14.123Z","Stunning, challenging and a LOT of fun","What do we want out of a Lego Star Wars set? 1) a nice result, 2) a challenging build, 3) a long time building the thing. The Motorized AT-AT delivers all this in spades.

I was convinced that this set was never going to appear at my local toystores. I gawked at it on Lego.com several times and almost bought it as many times. But then I was shopping for Duplo for my son and came across a stack of these babies. Not really cheap (180 euros), but that was of no concern to me. I had to have it.

I am glad I went against my better judgment, because this is by far THE best set I will ever buy. I dare say that this could even beat the awesome Falcon (which I do not have yet). The build was very very challenging. It is very important to keep exact track of the parts and the way they should be put together. Because this AT-AT walks it is crucial to get everything right. I have built numerous sets, but this set I had to take apart near the end because the mechanics did not work due to ONE part not added right. Now that is a challenging built.

Several hours later there was the stunning AT-AT. It looks absolutely real. The designers really did a cracking job on this set. Then I flipped the switch and it started walking. I expected it to shuffle a bit and take a long time to cross the room. But that is certainly not the case. This thing really lifts its feet and shifts its weight.It is fairly fast too. My son (nearly 2 years old) had a hard time keeping up with it.

If you want a set that is true to the spirit of Star Wars and are not taken aback by a brilliant build. Then this is the set for you!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minifigs: The minifigs are cool. It comes with general Veers, AT-AT driver,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snowtrooper, and Luke Skywalker (rebel suit). You can also find the snowtrooper in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lego set 8084 (snowtrooper battle pack).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AT-AT: Well, the atat itself is a nice vehicle. It has superior details, on the head&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the legs, and it&nbsp; can still be motorized. My&nbsp; walker walks perfectly just like in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the movie slowly lumbering across my floor with its head swaying fron side to side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems like it's going to tip, but it doesnt once you actually get a chance to use&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the motor. Luke Skywalker hangs from the bottom about to cut the thing up. This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set is very similar to lego set 8129 but 8129 has less pieces, and is not motorized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, this set has NO STICKERS! Another pro about this set is that if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a hoth or endor scene, you can use the AT-AT. One con about this set is that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main and secondary turrets fall off easily. This set can also go in reverse. Who said&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said the empire didn't have reverse?&nbsp;</p>

"hga09","2010-02-15T15:57:19.327Z","The best Star Wars set so far...","<p>There are bigger sets like the Millenium Falcon or the Death Star, or impressive looking sets like the Tantive IV or the Imperial Cruiser, but this must be the best Star Wars set in terms of overall fun, complexity, function and looks.</p>
<p>Despite what is visible from outside (the gray plate sheel), this is basically a Technic model in the core. It has an ingenius mechanism that moves all four legs in coordinated fashion from a single M motor so that the model can walk. The mechanics of the walk is very similar to the AT-AT walkers in Episode V. It also bobs its head from left to right while walking.</p>
<p>The build is definitely not simple, so it is probably not recommended for those who don't have any experience with Technic models. It took me about 3 hours to build, and a good portion of that was spent on sorting the pieces and building the Technic core. The mechanism that couples the motion of the motor to the legs requires very cafeful following of directions (e.g. placement of axles to within 1/2 plate height for the gearbox section). The precise alignment of the direction of the four tan pins in Step 20 is critical, otherwise, the AT-AT won't be able to walk.</p>
<p>The built in handle is an excellent feature, especially if you have a younger child/sibling who wants to play with it.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Very good looking model.</li>
    <li>Excellent motion: Walking and head bobbing.</li>

 removed a LOT of pieces already. <br><br>Then I followed the step by step instructions. Once I reached the finished part. I just installed it.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Gears/Gears/Gears:</span><br><br>The
 power function system is great! During the body frame construction, 
interconnected gears in the neck, front legs and back section make this 
move in synchrony. Just like a regular walking beast. A flick of the 
switch lever inside can make it move forward and backward too! This 
makes the AT-AT also move its head side to side.<br><br>The downside, 
once you stop it, you can't force the legs to move because of the gears.
 I guess you can force it,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> but I don't like to break it.</span> (<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> I DON'T</span> recommend you try)<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Space!</span><br>No
 its not outer space but space for the minifigs. The cockpit in the head
 fits 2. The driver and General Veers. How about Luke? He is hanging at 
the side. The snowtrooper? He is running. The inside of the beast has no
 space for minifigs due to the motorized system.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Showing the innards:</span><br><br>First
 the head, you can move it up just like a cockpit glass of the Y wing. 
The side plates also can be raised to access the on and off lever. The 
front and back section  of the body can also be raised. The top can be 
raised to make it a handle. Good thing LEGO made it this way in order to
 handle it easily.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">NOW The bad part(s):</span><br><br>It is a sturdy build 
but of course, there are those parts that easily get detached. And these
 are the plates in the body when you lift it up. As for the head, the 
side guns are the one that easily fall off.<br><br>As for the 
instructions, be careful since the color black and dark grey parts are 
sometimes confusing and if you mistakenly interchange one from the other
 it may cost you a lot of delay.<br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What I like the most.</span><br><br>The
 intricate system of the gears, the elaborate connection for the legs 
and feet are something I appreciate the most in this set.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall.</span><br><br>Standing
 12 inches high and 14 inches long, this behemoth will make anyone stop 
and glance to look what LEGO has created for the builders. The box say 
14+ years old. <br><br>But since my 4 year old daughter is already good 
with following instructions, she was able to do the feet section with 
some minor guidance.<br><br>If you dream of a SW beast that made the Empire win, then this is the set to get.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
