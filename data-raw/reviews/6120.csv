"Skafte","2007-08-01T09:30:09.44Z","Excellent value","This box of 600 pieces is a great addition to any collector's bulk brick box or for basic constructions. The only drawback is that the black and green pieces are not as many as the other four colours.

I got this set for 99 SEK (about $15), and it's just a question of how many I'm going to pick up! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AndreasL","2008-09-15T03:55:19.293Z","Too many 2x2 bricks","As is often the case with Lego's boxes of random bricks they contain way too many of the 2x2 bricks. In this case you get more than 200 of them out of 600 bricks. And 2x2 bricks are not very useful.
I got two of these sets pretty cheap. Now, I have to build a mountain or something that I can fill up with all those 2x2s.
