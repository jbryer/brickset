Vader like all pen minifigs has a hole right though him. The neck and leg joints(where they atach onto the torso) are cut short so the figs fragile and vaders mask won't come off his face. The pen still works fine but is bigger than most pens so it takes a bit off time to get used to it. This set would be a good set to put in christmas stockings, or a small gift.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The minifig can move its arms just like a regular minifig can, and the cape is life like. The actual pen comes out with a twist, and the middle is rubber for comfortable hold. Also, set includes interchangeable pieces.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
