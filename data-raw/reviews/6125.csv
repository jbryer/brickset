But I think as with all Lego pens the minifig gets messed up because a hole has too go right through it so it can go on the pen. Its very easy to change around the pen by unscrewing the top half off the pen and than sliding on differnt decroations than screwing it back on the R2 minifigure doesn't look to dffernt from a regular minifig as it already has a stud coming out off its head but its still a bit weak The pen works and looks great though which is what really matters.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Also, R2's legs fall out easily. I say that you should stick to the other lego pens unless you like R2. But if you do get it, don't mess with it, just use it as a pen!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
