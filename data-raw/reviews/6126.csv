To switch the decorations on the pen you unscrew the top part of it and pull it out you than can add or take of the decerations and they stay on a small metal stick and won't come  off when the top part is back onto the pen. The only problem is that the minifig's got a hole that goes right through it and the neck and legs are alot shorter than a normal minifig so its hard to keep together yoda should come with  his lightsaber but doesn't. The pen itself works well. 3.5/5 ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
