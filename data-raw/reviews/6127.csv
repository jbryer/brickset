Pros:

-Awesome vehicle!
-The mounted Cordak works well

Cons:

-A tad short
-Not a lot of new parts
-Hard to mount Toa onto sled ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The mask is the same of hahli mahri, and the body, feet, and arms, changing only in color. Have more difficult to light-up the eyes in this mask than anothers like the piraka and toa mahri. The armors on the body are strange, they moves easy. The toa isn't very cool than the sea sled. This contains two power swords, a cordak blaster and propeller parts never included in bionicle. Because of the toa, this set have a rate 4/5. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-13T22:27:58.92Z","Not Bad","This is a good set, but not the best set of 2007 as someone said. I am not a Bionicle fan and this is the reason why. I don't like the vehicle the figure is riding but the figure sure does look nice. The gun is cool but that is pretty much it. It is not the best set of 2007 but it is good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-24T07:23:48.42Z","I got this for &#163;15","This is a great set.  I got this last year in Tesco's for &#163;15, it is a special edition set as it says on the box, and it is definitely a great set.  You get toa Lesovikk and his sea sled.  Lesovikk can connect onto the sea sled and when he jumps on the sea sled, you can flip three blades and they go down into a standing position.

First I will review Lesovikk.

pros:
cool blade
Cool mask

cons:
limbs snap a lot

I think this set is really cool 4/5

Now I will review the sea sled

pros:
cool blades
cordak blaster really fires

cons:
none

4/5 Lesovikk, 5/5 sea sled overall 5/5.
