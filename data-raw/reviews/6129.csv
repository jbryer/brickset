As such, this is not suitable for play (unless you remove the aforementioned ring and chain with some pliers - not something I recommend), but it's ideal for collectors like myself.  Of course, you can always use it as an *actual* keychain if you prefer.

Oh, one last thing: despite the official Lego description (and the name at the top of this page) stating this is a ""Clone Trooper"", this minifig is actually a ""Clone Pilot - sw118"" (like you find in the ARC-170 Starfighter set no. 7259) - the air-hoses printed on the chest are a dead give-away.  Go and check it out!

Enjoy!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
