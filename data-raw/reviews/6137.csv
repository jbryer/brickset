Pros:
Ha-Ya-To!
Hikaru!
Takeshi!
You can take off all the parts except the little part of the pants!

Cons:
Magnets.

over all, This is a REALLY great set! (even though I havent got it in the mail yet) :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The reason I gave this set a 5 is because of the many uses of the minifigs.</p>

"alexfig8","2021-03-03T22:50:49.253Z","Easy way to get Exo-Force minifigures","<p>This is a pretty easy way to get the main Exo-Force characters without having to buy all of the sets.&nbsp; Unlike Star Wars minifigures, they don&#39;t have any sort of base, the magnets are directly in the minifigures&#39; legs.&nbsp; This does mean that the torso and legs do NOT come apart, however, this isn&#39;t a huge deal since the figures are still fully poseable as a normal figure would be.&nbsp; The heads and hair seem to be normal, the hair fits a little bit looser but not anything terrible, and the heads are still double-sided as the figures normally are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s worth it to get the main figures at a fairly cheap price.</p>
