While I may not ever buy any, that doesn't stop anyone from giving one to me as&nbsp;a Christmas Gift. I'm grateful for the gift, always fun to get LEGO. And it went up on the refrigerator and has joined my holiday decorations to put out every year now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My particular set doesn't match up to the picture shown, but this one is the closest. Red Bricks/magnets for where it's white. The tree, box of gifts and Santa Minifigure are the same. The tree, Santa and box of gifts all detach and come off from this set. (A feature as I understand it, won't be in future Magnet Sets).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the standpoint that this is to be a LEGO themed Holiday Decoration/Magnet... there isn't much you can do with it for playing as you put it on your refrigerator. It looks cool and you show off being a huge LEGO Fan. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these are intended for decoration, then yes, I actually would support LEGO gluing all future Minifigures and other parts to their Magnet bases. Nothing worse then you bumping the magnet and pieces go flying off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're buying this for the Minifigure and parts. That's a bit too expensive and alittle on the wasted money side - where this Magnet set is concerned. I can see why with other Magnet sets people were buying them and taking the minifigures. Hence why if it's the minifigures that people want, LEGO should do more Battle Packs and Minifigure Collections for people to buy.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,1,3
