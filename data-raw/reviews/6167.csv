First, the torsos are unprinted - this of course is not necessarily a bad thing. However, the knights all have the same Rascus face (a bit of a downside). Still great for army building though; the castle line already had plenty of footsoldiers, but even if you want limited knights, five extra (although no horses) perhaps makes for a more impressive army. The armoured undead figures with the printed armour are much better opponents in my opinion than the skeletons.

Another point to note is that you actually get 20 flat black tiles in this set, which is at least a useful extra. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the board, as it is glued to the box (if you don't mind wrecking the box, I guess you could rip it out). The box is lovely, but to be honest, few people are likely to store this on a shelf as a tic-tac-toe game. So really, it's not entirely useful to have the nice box.

In summary, it's worth the price to get 10 armed minifigs with the plates thrown in. You'll just wish you had a use for the box and that the board wasn't attached.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
