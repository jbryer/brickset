The car is the same as all cars from that period, a 4x10 base plate, two wheel sets, a head lights beam in front and a 2x4 brick as a trunk. Windows are &#189; frosted roofs. What makes this into a taxi is the 2x3 bricks with taxi on it, one tallow sign on top of the roof, and the black colour scheme. The black colour scheme is used in many countries so this taxi is universally usable.
Quite simple but very effective, is it instantly recognizable as a taxi. The 2x3 bricks with taxi are of a quality the don’t make anymore these days because they haven’t lost colour to this date. So for a starter set this is a very good one. And while you are collecting sets for your Legoland town, why don’t you buy two? They’re not expensive, and what is a town with only one taxi? You can use them with the 1970s train station and a 1960s 1x6 beam with TAXI on it to make tour town complete.
