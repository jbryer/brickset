"Brock_the_Builder","2008-05-06T14:48:37.843Z","Simplicity at its best","I have been re-assembling Legos for days after pulling them out of the closet after 20+ years.  I had the instructions for 98% of my sets.  At the end, I had certain pieces left over that were unique-- in this case, the forklift piece.

After searching Brickset for 'forklift', I stumbled upon this gem, and my memory was awakened.  I had all the pieces to recreate this little beauty.

This is a very simple set, and may be my earliest memory of Lego.  A real classic.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kramii","2013-01-09T05:00:57.443Z","One of the great pre-minifig sets","<p>As a child, this was one of my all-time favourite sets.</p><p>This model has just 21 pieces, and its simplicity meant that I regularly disassembled and reassembled it (often following a ""car crash"") and took great delight in being able to rebuild without glancing at the instructions.</p><p>The minifig included with the set is old-style, and this may be a little off-putting to some collectors. However, these minifigs were real progress before the introduction of articulated minifigs. Indeed, I vividly recall that this little guy found himself protagonist in many of my LEGO-based adventures, and driver of many a MOC. Moreover, my 8 year old son is as happy to play with these old-style figures as he is to play with their modern counterparts.<br></p><p>Of course, compared to modern sets, this set looks rather primitive and ""blocky"", so if you're looking for an elegant display piece this isn't for you.. However, considering the piece-count and parts available when it was released, this is a great-looking set - it is, after all, unmistakably a forklift.</p><p>The best part of this set, however, was the forklift component itself. Its 
sprung mechanism made it great for lifting the supplied load, as well as
 being the perfect launch-pad sending your little bricks sky-high!</p><p>Considering it small size and low piece-count, this set had tons of playability. From shifting loads to launching parts to supplying a minifigure, this set has a lot to offer a child's imagination and an adults appreciation. I recommend it for both adult collectors and children with an imagination.<br></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Easy build even without the instructions.<br></li><li>Excellent use of available parts</li><li>Lots of playability<br></li><li>Sprung fork-lift part!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No modern mini-fig<br></li><li>A bit blocky-looking compared to modern sets<br></li></ul>
<p>In comparison to modern kits, this set looks rather primitive. On the other hand, if you want simple playable model that invokes 70s LEGO nostalgia, then look no further.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,5
