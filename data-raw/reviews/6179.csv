I think every big theme such as ex-force does need some mini sets.
they do make a good addition.

Pros:

good minifig &quot;ryo&quot;
every big theme needs some mini sets
nice set

cons:

you mite need some more sets to have some fun,
but you can still play with it.

overall good 4/5 set! Well done LEGO!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
