I knew once the movie was out of theaters it wouldn't be long until the set was discounted. 20 bucks for this set? Not me, I got it for 3.48! At this price you can't go wrong!

There are 9 Creator sets inside. 
A frog (green and dark green bricks make this set a winner).
A whale (blue and white, nothing special)
A Hummer (black, beautiful simple design, one of the sets that made me want this set)
A Triceratops (cute design, great dark red, red bricks)
A Helicopter (similar to the 3 in 1 Creator set from 07 #4918)
A Jet (great looking design, again similar to the 3 in 1 Creator set from 07 #4918)
A lion (great for tan parts, plates with tooth, not a bad design)
A Speedboat (simple, easy build but it does include cheese slopes)
A Backhoe/Frontloader Construction Vehicle (the other set that I wanted to own and major reason I bought this set).

Out of the 9 sets, I enjoyed the Hummer, Construction Vehicle, and Jet the most. There are a lot of parts in this set that I now have in my collection of parts. I save sets that I really enjoy as complete sets in their own Ziploc bags and sets that I don't particularly care for I sort out into my parts collection to be used for MOCs. Out of the 9 sets I saved the Hummer and Construction Vehicle as complete sets and sorted out the rest. 

If you can find this set on clearance it is up to you if it is worth 20 bucks. It does have 324 pieces so the 10.00 per 100 parts rule is broken here to our benefit which part of the reason why I scored this set a 4. I am curious to see how LEGO is portrayed in the movie this set is from.

"Smallsam99","2008-04-07T13:29:03.513Z","Good Buy","If you are able to find this set for about 10.00 or less it is a steal! This set is a lot of rare creator sets, some unique and some ordinary. None the less it is still good. 

Pros: 9 mini sets

hummer and backhoe

Frog and whale can be used for sea creatures

other uses can be used for the other sets.

Cons: box has no seals?

a little too many ordinary pieces(doesn't bother me that much)

nothing else

Still i only got it for 10.00 bucks so whose's complaining. It is about an 8.5/10.0 barely enogh for a 5 rating.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AndreasL","2009-10-01T22:23:41.09Z","A nice book of wonder","This set was released with the average children movie ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"". Not a great film that had little to do with Lego - other than it was about a toy store and it featured many different toys. Actually the most prominent product placement in the movie was Brio trains.

Anyway, this set comes with nine small kits that were also released in 2006 with very limited distribution. So this set is a great way to get most of these small impulse sets. The big container box is nice. It is shaped like a book (Mr. Magorium's big magical book) and is more robust than a normal Lego box. It can be put on a shelf and looks nice.

The nine sets are listed below. All have been given a small grade (1 to 5):
7602 Black SUV (5)
7604 Triceratops (5)
7606 Frog (4)
7609 Rescue Chopper (2)
7610 Speedboat (3)
7871 Whale (4)
7872 Animal Set - Lion (5)
7873 Aeroplane Set (4)
7875 Backhoe (4)

The content in the nine sets are a very nice assortment of useful small bricks that are great to have for your own designs.

The set was only released in the US but it can (or could) be found on eBay for non-US residents.

The set is great with smaller children from four and up who can exercise their Lego skills with these small sets.

It is very recommended.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"tkettle9719","2011-12-28T17:11:36.467Z","A truly amazing, imaginative set","<p>This set was a Target exclusive I just happened to find at the very reasonable 20 dollar price tag, which I received from my grandparents for Christmas. It is a very amazing set for small children, and I still love it. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-All of the sets are good in their own little ways.<br></li><li>-This set also has a great assortment of vehicles and animals.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The overall playability of this set is with each individualized set, not all nine at the same time.<br></li><li>-The animals seem to be more heavily flawed than the machines.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is a real gift to all children, and now comes at quite a high cost, but I would gladly spend 50 dollars on this. This set is just short o perfection.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
