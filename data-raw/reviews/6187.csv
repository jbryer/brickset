Magic Box is a menu in a fast food restaurant named Quick. This LEGO set can only be obtained by buying a Magic Box in Quick.

It contains very nice parts and is a great addition to every Lego City of 2007!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-12-26T08:21:28.7Z","Great  Brickmaster Set","This set came along with the Fire Boat with my Brickmaster subscription. I couldn't believe that there were 2 sets and both had minifigs. Good job LEGO. The set itself is cute. As a child I couldn't understand how the helicopters and spaceship cockpits could be open (don't the pilots suffocate?). This set reminds me of that same question. The use of the technic beam is brilliantly executed because it looks great, is sturdy and a cheaper alternative than using bricks and plates to create this part of the helicopter. This was a great welcome back to the Brickmaster club. I would recommend subscribing to the Brickmaster if the sets they send out are as good as these 2. The magazine itself has a few Brickmaster exclusive pages but other than that it is nearly identical to the LEGO Club magazine that we can get for free by mailing in the post card that comes with all LEGO sets. If you are debating whether or not to sign up for Brickmaster, let the sets you get be the reason, not the magazine. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"shima55","2008-02-29T20:03:01.7Z","Great promotion","This set, along with 4992, were the Brickmaster exclusive sets one month. This would be a good buy if priced under $4.00, but for free it can't be beat.

Pros:
Neat Minifigure face 
Add-on to police force
Solid build
Opening cockpit
Beleivable design

Cons:
Suit on Minifigure seems out of place for a pilot
Helmet does not match suit
Cockpit is too open
Technic piece used for tail is too thin

Overall, a good promo and add-on to any city, but don't go bankrupt trying to get it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BrikmanMcStudz","2008-02-25T20:54:17.247Z","First review","This is just a cute little helicopter. I love it!
Minifig
9.5/10
I kinda like the new head
I also got my first grey shield with the helmet and includes police uniform

Hellicopter overall
9.9/10
The helicopter comes with many unique pieces. The two propellers are more aireplane scale but this is a small helicopter, not a large one, so i'm ok. The shield could've been a bit covered up more, considering some rouge crook my snipe the pilot(huh?)I also like how the cokpit can be rasied up with the flipper piece, unlike most LEGO helicpoters. Get it today!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguysw","2008-10-22T13:50:26.09Z","For a free set, this is excellent!","(Please note this is written for the perspective of someone getting this free with the Daily Mirror. I DO own this set.)
As a  promotional, this set is great! The minifig is cool, and it has some greatparts, like a video camera and megaphone. If you live in the UK, get the whole collection form the Mirror!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EL_Mo","2008-01-26T09:41:45.903Z","Completley useless.","I got this set from the brickmaster. I was very upset when I opened it. This is because the instructions were for a completely different model along with the second set. Luckily, they did throw in another instruction guide for this set. I built it, and found it to be useless. It is way to small for it to even be able to lift the guy. And the cockpit is hardly covering any of the guy. I would give it a one if there wasn't the couple cool pieces and the minifig. Only get this if it is free or close to it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Stayontargetprod","2009-12-02T22:35:02.187Z","Good Set","This is a pretty good set for a brickmaster. That's how I got it at least. Good for like a cramped city. Really my only police set I can keep put together. LoL!
The minifig is nice too. Nice head. Not just your average smiley face.
Overall around 4 1/2 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rinaldo","2011-12-09T08:24:13.737Z","Very nice small helicopter","<p>
 This article si based on a special set that are normally not found in stores but are sold on special occasions at malls or in magazines typically attached to American or British newspaper.</p>
<p>
 The LEGO set 4991 was released in late 2007 and early 2008, it is part of the series City Police , consists of 31 pieces and a minifig. Was sold in a plastic bag, with brick and directly into the instructions.</p>
<p>
 The installation is very simple and returns a very nice mini helicopter, accompanied by policemen with a minifig helmet and visor</p>
<p>
 The helicopter while being made ??with a few pieces (31 to be precise), is well done, has two runners with megaphones and lighthouse light, respectively, a cockpit with a glass lift that allows you to easily insert the minifig, a steering wheel, and finally well proportioned two helices that return harmony to the set.</p>
<p>
 PRO<br />
 &bull;Overall structure of solid<br />
 &bull;Glass Cockpit lift<br />
 &bull;Well proportioned Two helixes<br />
 AGAINST<br />
 &bull;I would have liked some more brick on the back of the queue to give greater harmony.</p>
<p>
 Conclusion<br />
 This is a mini-set of&nbsp; LEGO , very nice, well that goes well with the various feasible scenarios based on City-Police . For those interested in buying the network to seek advice from private English dealers.</p>
<p>
 Overall Rating<br />
 GOOD</p>
