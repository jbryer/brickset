Magic Box is a menu in a fast food restaurant named Quick. This LEGO set can only be obtained by buying a Magic Box in Quick.

It contains very nice parts and is a great addition to every Lego City of 2007!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The minifig is cool and overall the set looks good.
As done before the windscreen is pointless as the minifig see's over it. Nice pieces though!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I enjoyed building this set and couldn't believe that it included a minifig and there was another set as well that was mailed along with this set. The parts are very basic but the fire boat does come with a water cannon. The engine for the boat is a small 2x2 sloped wedge part that looks good in the rear of the boat. I was pleasantly surprised with both of the Brickmaster sets that came last month. It seems like LEGO realized they made a mistake last year sending out sets that you can buy in stores (they were advertised as Brickmaster exclusive sets so why could they be bought in stores). If this set were to be bought in a store it would be a 3 but being that it was a Brickmaster set, I scored it a 5. It is definitely better than other sets that I have received from LEGO's Brickmaster program.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
