One of the spring impulse sets that can sometimes be found in the stores. I like this set as it does come with a construction mini fig and a little street cleaner. Not much use for the street sweeper but it does a good job of keeping the gas station drive ways clean and of course it's always nice to have another builder. A solid 4 on this one so if you see it, pick it up as there are always parts of your city that need cleaning that the street sweep vehicle can't get too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legocityfanatic","2010-11-08T17:34:28.177Z","Awesome little set.","Hey, first of all, I got this set in the mail today. (I ordered the parts from lego.com) And I was really happy! I opened the small bag, dumped the pieces on the table and started building. The build is pretty simple, as it requires few steps and was made in under a minute. I played with it a little then I had to do some college studying. The price is awesome since I got it for free. I would use this for my currently expanding Lego City as a driveway sweeper. That's my review so far, hope you enjoy!<div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Yes, I do recommend it!</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
