"Kid_Paddle","2007-10-26T04:16:23.747Z","Docter and Patient","This set is very simple, but I think many people would like to own it because of the female doctor. Female minifigs are very popular because they are in minority.

In Belgium, the set can be obtained for free by buying LEGO for â‚¬ 30,- in toy store FUN.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"AddictedToStyrene","2007-11-05T08:40:35.717Z","Cute","A cute little promo set. Just a doctor doing her rounds - with a coffee cup of course, and a patient on a very simple hospital bed. The black and green thing is probably meant to be a stand holding a drip. Who knows - maybe it's the alien alert scan button for when the little guy mutates into a Martian?
Overall it is a very simple set, supposed to inspire you to build a clinic or a hospital for your town - the best part is the detailed painting of a stethoscope on the doctor's torso. Nice little touch, that.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BludChylde1","2008-06-21T12:20:38.78Z","Nice set","Got this set in one of the cookie tins at TRU.

The female doctor is a definite plus, the parts are all usefull.

I just wish I had picked up a couple more tins because I'm enjoying the cookies as much as I enjoy the Lego.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The female doctor is cool, I like the looks of the patient with his crew cut hair and face. Very inexpensive set can still be purchased on S &amp; H. Goes well with the ambulance set or the new Coast Guard sets. Great addition to any LEGO collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Pepper","2009-01-29T12:57:02.03Z","This set is actually my sister's","Well, as the title states, this set is my sister's. It is a nice little set. But it would be better if we had other 'rescue' sets. <br/><br/>pros<br/>nice female doctor<br/>cup<br/>price<br/><br/>cons<br/>patient (I don't like his head)<br/>not that good by itself<br/><br/>Overall, pretty decent set. It would be better with a hospital or something like that, though. ",TRUE,3,3,2,2,3
"samuraiturtle","2009-11-11T05:10:43.873Z","A Hospital Battle Pack?","A hospital battle pack?  That is the best discriptin for this set. All it is a female doctor and her patient (a guy in this case) with a bed.  You will probley want a couple of these if you have a hospital to go a long with it.  The set come with a cup and a bonus robot arm witch I use as an medical tool.  The bed is not to complex to make, it does have an iv drip to help get your mini-figures better.  The set did come in a poly-bag so that should tell you the price and size of it.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"meyerc13","2010-10-31T02:01:57.14Z","Friendly Female Doctor","I just built a hospital for my Lego City, and thought it would be a good time to review this set.<br><br>The good - a female minifig, and even better she's a doctor!&nbsp; Plus you get a second minifig which generally isn't the case with these small impulse sets.&nbsp; With two minifigs you can act out a hospital scene with only this set and nothing else.&nbsp; <br><br>I wouldn't say that there is anything bad about this set, but the bed is fairly uninspired.&nbsp; I've seen some great hospital beds created by Lego fans, so if you're building a Lego Hospital you'll probably want to build a better bed and use these parts elsewhere.<br><br>Overall this is a great impulse set and goes great with a Lego Hospital or clinic.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"AETerry","2011-05-09T20:01:35.883Z","Doc & Patient Review","<p>At the risk of creating a fallacy of reviewing a set I didn't buy... I did how ever manage to make this set from pieces on hand that I do own after finding a pdf copy of the instructions and assembling it from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The female minifigure I was able to ""put together"" from a LEGO store Build-A-Mini feature and with&nbsp;pieces from&nbsp;extra Lego bricks &amp; elements that I've amassed over the years. So putting this set together was an exercise of ""can I do it?"" Yes I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build is fairly simple, one can build it without even a copy of the instructions, just from the picture alone. That easy and straight forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What pulled my interest to this small set is 1) the new print design for minifigure doctors and that this one is female. And 2) the pieces used to create an IV drip for the patient. And the IV drip is what really did it as I feel like an old dog some days learning new tricks and seeing new ways of looking at these bricks and elements with how to use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a very fun, simple set and easy to build. And one who's build I plan to incorporate into the Hospital set that I do own to expand on it. There is indeed a lot of playability with it too for scenes. My little one has already taken the completed model and is busy playing on the floor with it.</p>",TRUE,4,2,3,5,5
