"Luftlego","2007-12-13T10:54:14.78Z","One of my best Lego purchases ever!","I bought this set, along with the rest of the Indiana Jones collection (all Indy sets are available now at TRU - Richardson TX 12/11/07). I was amazed and excited to find all of them out on store shelves, especially before the end of the year. TRU has them all priced above msrp, but worth it since these sets are selling for crazy amounts of money on ebay.
Anyway, back to the review. This is a great set! Probably the best minifigs I have ever owned with lots of little details. 

Pro's: Awesome collection of new minifigs. Maybe even the best ever created by Lego.

Con's: The motorcycles are too modern for the early 1940's, and the gate is a little on the plain side.

Overall, this is a must buy for any Lego or Indy fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

3 great minifigs
lots of new parts for 2008

"Yeow","2008-01-07T00:30:04.17Z","Great Addition","I definetely enjoyed this set a lot. It's nice to see 2 wheeled motorcycles again, even if they do look a bit modern. Kudos to Lego for not making the sidecar one juniorized peace, definetely adds more value to the set. I'm also a sucker for guns, and this is a cheap way to get them, plus my set had an extra gun :D. Other than that, the Guard shack is pretty lame and useless to the set (better off as a gate in a Lego town) and the barricade doesn't sit parallel with the ground, it's slanted down. I am definetely digging these modern crates though.

dr. jones and nazi figures

motorcycles

realistic crates

The motorcycles are KEWL (tho I agree, too modern for the 40's, but the Indy flicks were full of allegories anyway).  The 3 figures (Henry Sr, Indy &amp; a generic &quot;nazi&quot;) are fun.  The minifigs are my favorite part of Lego, so three in a $10 set is a great feature.  Sidecar is fun.  Was glad to see its built and not a molded piece attached to the cycle.

"Tri_pod_king","2008-05-20T20:18:21.437Z","Not bad at all...","This is my first review of a Lego set(but definitely not my last ; ) . ) Sorry it took me until May to figure it out. Anyway, on to the review:
                      I got this set for Christmas because I REALLY wanted it. Once I unwrapped it, I was all like, quote:''Victory is mine!''. These were the 3 following steps I took: #1:Opened it #2 Built it #3 Loved it.
This set is a cute little set, but unfortunately has a few flaws. The one that bothers me the most is that it includes a diary printed on Indy's father and a map. As I recall, after they got the Nazis off their tale, they were arguing about whether to go to Italy to get the map, or to go back to Berlin to get the diary. So for that set to be more accurate, it should not include a map or diary, but include a cross sign pointing one way saying Italy, and the other pointing the opposite way saying Berlin. Other flaws include the lack of Nazis, the lack of detail on the tollbooth, and the lack of articulation on Indy's whip. (Well, I guess they need the lack of articulation for when he's swinging over the pit in the Temple Escape.) Well, I guess that just about wraps up this review, but I still highly recommend this set to Indiana Jones fans and Lego fans all alike.
                                                                                                -the Tri-pod King

I have to say this is a very good set to start off with! You get three min figures in a $12.99 [ $9.99 U.S] set,pretty good deal :) Most sets nowadays have 1 or 2.... for $26.99 or less.Lego sets don't often come with two motorcycles! yet in a $12 dollar set. 

   Indy figure:  The Indiana jones figure is Fanstatic! as well as his father! very nice detail! Indy's hat is great design compared to the johnny thunder one , in fact more realistic looking. The hand bag is a neat idea but sometimes it can get in the way. The whip is a cool piece to have! Although you can't see it in this picture. It is all curled up but it can be uncurled for play! The legs have a nice belt picture on it, which is always nice to see some print on the legs now and then.     
 
Henry Jones:This min figure is cool! First off it has a good colour scheme to it! The details on the torso is very creative! It even has the Grail Dairy in his pocket! The face is realistic looking ,Good job lego!    

The guard:Not much to say, good colour scheme.  

The rest of it: I think this set for accurcy is a rating of 9.7/10 because the gate in the movie [last crusade] the gate has a another bar at the bottom. The motorcycles are cool pieces to have. I like the side car how it can detach from indy's bike.

Nazi Face could be more Detailed
Only one Nazi
Nazi Motorcycle Doesn't Balance
Flag tips
Only half a guardhouse

The Build was simple and fun, it took about five minutes altogether. The Double seated Motorbike is wicked! It can fit both Indy's Whip and a Backpack on it, and the seating for Henry Jones is comfortable, as it should be! 
The Nazi is quite well done too, his body is neat and similar  to the movie, his helmet is new, and bis bike rocks!
Finally onto the Post thing. It really is brilliant! I mean, the barrier goes up fine, but it can also be knocked off when Indy's bike strike's it! And... it's handy to have the Flag and the boxes for added games.

You get two bikes with frames and enduro fairings. Of course, you can always ditch the latter and use your imagination to create a different bike - which is why I got this one in the first place.

Add to that 3 minifigs (Indy, Henry and a soldier). Oh, and what really made my day - a bikers' helmet with an extra pair of goggles that you can use on your other helmets.

I would have liked it if there was more than just half of a guard shack. The flag doesn't stand up. The boxes look good on a harbour scene. I gave Mutt the Nazi bike. Also the side car doesn't detach very easy, and it has a big ugly axle sticking out. Also the bikes don't look like motor bikes, they look like dirt bikes. if want some good figs and some dirt bikes, get it. But I am kind of disapointed in it. So I give it a 3.5 out of 5.

I would have rather had two nazi motorcyclists than the boxes and the flag - the other nazi could have had a different face and maybe an extra hat if he wants to stand at the booth instead. Also the booth could have had more detail, even if just a lever for the guard to pull to raise and lower the bar. Maybe the booth could have been a proper box with a door on the side and a bench with a mug on it and a walkie talkie?

I guess these changes would have bumped up the price though and this is already a little expensive for the cheapest Indiana Jones set. The two motorcycles are nifty and I like the Henry Jones Senior figure.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

My older brother had seen Last Crusade around my age, and at some point I got this set. Well,&nbsp;I need to admit that The Last Crusade is&nbsp;my favorite Indiana Jones movie, so I like this set a lot now. Anyway, onto the set review!</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>I can&#39;t remember, I&nbsp;was six years old.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The set has three minifigures,&nbsp;Indiana Jones,&nbsp;Professor Henry Jones Senior, and a guard. They all have good printing (none of which&nbsp;lasted by the time of reviewing&nbsp;this). Indy and the&nbsp;guard both have standard revolvers, while Henry has a treasure map. Odd choice of parts for Henry, they could have done a book for his diary (which is already printed in his left pocket) or been more accurate and not given him an accessory at all. There are two motorcycles, one of which has a sidecar for Henry to go in, while Indy drives the motorcycle itself. The guard, on the other hand, just has a regular motorcycle. As for the other builds, there is a generic flagpole, two boxes, and a toll gate. The gate reminds me of the one in the Scarecrow: Pizza Delivery set, which also had a motorcycle with another vehicle attached.</p>

<h2>Playability</h2>

<p>You can knock over the gate, containers and flag.</p>

<h2>Value for Money</h2>

<p>I can not really say, my parents gave me it. But at the original retail price, seems hit or miss (somewhat hit).</p>
