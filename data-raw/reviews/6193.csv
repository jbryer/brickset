"legoguysw","2008-01-07T06:17:00.233Z","Come on Lego!","Lego has made a fantastic start to 2008 with their latest theme: Lego Indiana Jones!
 
The Ark Of The Covenant: Nice gold pieces, not too big, fits nicely in the temple!
Traps; Falling Statues: These work well, and look like real Anubis statues. When a technic rod is removed from each side, they fall into the loose walls, and on one side reveal a hanging skeleton! The other side could have had something behind it, such as a stairway like in the movie. Do this at home.
Traps; Snake Shower: Very simple but effective: Pull a lever at the back and the bottom of the trough opens up and snakes (ten in total, 5 red and 5 green). Sometimes the front of the trough pops off, and this is a bit tricky to put back on without the whole thing (by that i mean the mechanism) collapsing.
And the rest: Very realistic. There are steps leading up to a platform with the Ark, and there are spare hieroglyphics to stick on the plain parts up and above it (not on it). In this set, the stickers don’t make it any worse. They are not in a position where they could come off, and if Lego had tried to print them on it wouldn’t have worked well. There are two spaces next to the platform, were you could add more treasure if you wanted. The colour scheme in this set is very good and realistic.
Minifigures: Only two, Indy and Marian. Both very detailed, and Indy’s shoulder bag, hat and whip look very cool. The whip can expand, but doesn’t stretch and curls back into shape. 
Additional info: the Red bits on the end of the technic rods you pull out come off the rods easily. I took them off and put them somewhere else in the set. They work well there. The front of the trough has golden bits, and has a picture of C-3PO and an Egyptian  worshipping R2-D2! This set fits right in with Adventurers sets.
Overall, a great set. I recommend this set to Indy and Adventurers fans alike!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2008-01-17T03:39:31.013Z","A fun little set","Despite being a rather inaccurate representation of the tomb in the Raiders movie, this set is still pretty fun, packed with nifty play features. On the whole, the tomb does look a little plain and too small, but the little details spruce it up. The minifigures of Indy and Marion are excellent, and the Anubis jackyls don't look too bad either. The Ark of the Covenant looks quite alright, although I do wish they had molded Cherubim as they did with bats. The small red technic bits on the ends of the rods fall out far too easily, but the falling statues are a great play feature. The collapsible walls work fine as well, but my favourite flourish is still the roof from which the snakes fall into the tomb. The stickers look great, especially the little touch with R2 and C-3PO, a great nod to the film.

Usually when I get a lego, it looks smaller than on the box, but for this one it looked bigger. Reminds me of the old Egyptian sets for Adventures. The Marion figure is nice, and so is the ark and falling snake trap. The bad part of this lego are the round red balls on the technic pins. They come off way too easily and are pretty much just used for decoration. The walls some times don't fall down when the statue hits them, and there's no top floor so Indie and Marion can fall down in to the tomb. It should have included a trap door at the top. Still, a good set. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

In that case its a great display set! It is well built and has many traps. But it is also very small. But for a $20 dollar set... who cares?! I love this set for these reasons:
- Minifigures Marion Ravenwood, and of course Indiana
- 2 traps (actually 3 if you count the other falling Anubis statue) 1. At the top of the set there is a secret container that holds 10 snakes (5 green 5 red) and if you if you pull down on the brick handle the snakes will fall out onto the floor. 2. In the set you see 2 Anubis statues. There is a technic piece that holds the statues upright if you pull the piece out the statues will fall and crash into the two weak walls thus making an opening for Marion and Indy to escape!
- crystal (blue)
- Ledges (for Indy's whip to latch on and send him flying up)

Includes two minifigs, Indy and Marion (with a two-sided face). There are two traps: pull a lever on the back and ten snakes (5 red and 5 green) drop down (they sometimes get stuck though). Pull out the sticks on the sides and the Anubis statues drop down and crash through the walls (though you have to attach the walls loosely or they don't break). The main reason I got the set was for the Ark of the Covenant - which is also the one thing I can find significant fault in. some of the pieces are brown, and I modified it slightly to look better (there's a yellow bit that to me looks kinda rubbish so I replaced it with a brown bit from one of my boxes).

"Paradosis","2009-06-16T01:50:09.92Z","A Solid Set","This is a nice little set that is part of the Indiana Jones theme. It's a fairly compact set, measuring in at only 7"" wide by 3 3/4"" deep by 5 3/4"" high. But there are a lot of details in this set, and a lot of plusses, which far outweigh any issues someone might have. 

The color scheme is a very nice tan, with gold, black and other colors as accents. This gives just the right atmosphere to a setting like the one being portrayed. The mostly black statues are done well, with arms, ears, etc. And the statues have a mechanism that lets them fall through the back walls (revealing on one side a skeleton hanging on a chain). I particularly like the torches in this set for some reason. There are some stickers, which are a turn off to some, but they are well done, and add quite a bit to the set... indeed, the walls would be quite plain without them.

There are two minifigs (and 1 skeleton) in this set, which is adequate, though a third minifig would have been nice. The Indy fig is well done, with a whip, satchel, hat and nice printing on the torso, legs and head. The Marion figure is much plainer, but still adequate. She does have a two sided head, one side witha  frown/scared face, and the other side with a smile. There is also a generally well designed trap door which drops ten snakes on unsuspecting minifigs who would try to get too close to the ark; however, some of the snakes usually get stuck when you try to use the trap door.

The ark of the covenant is adequately done, though a little understated, and to some extent fades to the background. Also, viewed from the back the set is rather plain, so this is definitely one that must be normally viewed from the front or sides.

So, would I recommend this set? While there are definitely a few issues I have with the set, overall I think it's a good set, and would indeed recommend it. It has a pretty good value to it, and the playability factor is also pretty good for the set, even if it's a bit cramped for space. I'd give the set a 78/100.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legonater","2009-01-06T20:56:07.013Z","Wait... Another Ark?","It's interesting to find that most of the Indy sets have a few differences from the movie. In this one ti's less obvious, however still there. Yet except the one thing, it's an excellent, detailed set. The new torch peices are cool, and the falling statue technique should be used again. Inspecially how it breaks through the wall. I love the Threepio painting, which is actually in the movie. And all those snakes!  But what's with the crystal? It wasn't in the movie! What's it there for?
Anyways, the differences: 
Marion was not there when the Ark was. They removed the Ark and Dropped in marion, And it's the only set with the actual Ark! There Boxes and chests, But no Ark! And there were no crystals in the ark! And this one won't even open! That's actually the only con. Averything else is fanatstic. A great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MandalorianCandidate","2008-12-07T19:44:28.75Z","Snakes....I hate 'em, but I l love this set","This was my first Indiana Jones set, quite appropriate I think being one of the most iconic sets/scenes from the four movies, and one of my favorites.  I've had it sitting on my desk shelves since Dec. 2008 because it's just a neat set.  Like my 1999 Snowspeeder, I just can't stop going back to it and fiddling around.  Sure it really has no swooshability, but if it did it would be kicking some serious Nazi trash.

I've thought about how Lego could have made this set and I think they did the right approach.  They could have made a fairly large setup with taller Anubis (dog-headed) statues and a more elaborate crash-down wall (another skeleton for the other panel would have been nice), but other than that, what else would we need that wasn't in the film?

This set is a faithful Lego-type recreation of the scene and pretty much all the 'necessary' elements are present:  the ubiquitous Indy+whip, Marion in her white dress, the Arc of the Covenant (yeah, it looks OK), a couple of torches, and a butt-load of snakes!  The only thing missing that would have made the set just right would have been a Sallah minifig, but I can forgive that because it can be set up easy for the scene after the Arc is removed from its resting place.

The structure itself is nice and sturdy.  The collapsing panel feature is slightly too stiff as I need some force to get the walls to pop off.  I also like the falling snake mechanism as there were snakes dropping out of the walls in the movie.  There's even a nice nod to the easter egg of C-3PO and R2-D2 from the movie in the form of a (*gasp*) sticker, which is my other beef--I HATE THE STICKERS.  I guess we'll just be stuck (no pun intended) with them for a while as Lego shows no sign of going back to the tampographs.

As for the parts selection, we get a little better than 10 cents a part, but there aren't exotic or rare pieces except for the tan pearl/C-3PO color of the arc and the carrots...I mean torches.

Also, the 'falling statues' gimmick is a bit dodgy and doesn't always work as designed, and some of the snakes don't fall properly through the gap, and the yellow bars don't fit properly though the arm sockets leaving black marks on them, and the red balls don't fit very well on the grey rods and tend to come off when you pull them... some of these might not be problems with other people's sets, but I'm taking it down a rating anyway. Also, why does the skeleton look so 'angry'? They should have used the round-eyed skeleton head instead.

On the plus side, there's some good details and designs here, the statues and the ark and the stickers are great. The removable torches are a nice touch and I like the gold pieces on the ark. The Indy figure is awesome, but he's in lots of other sets too so nothing special there.

                                  pros: cool ark with gold pieces
                                           realistic statues
                                           star wars sticker (just what i wanted)
                                           cool gem and scary sceleton
                                           Marion in white dress which isn't cinda common

                                  cons:WHERE IS SALLAH!!

"AETerry","2011-04-15T11:52:54.243Z","Snakes, why'd it have to be snakes?!","<p>Of all of the Indiana Jones sets I have, this one ranks in at one of my all time favorites. From Raiders of the Lost Ark, you have a play set for one of the iconic scenes of the movie when Marion and Indy are trapped down in the chamber/tomb area and trying to get out. Snakes that drop down, a skeleton that pops out to drop on Marion. Statues falling over. You have a printed piece/sticker for C-3PO and R2D2 that's funny to see and is even found in the movie. While the ark wasn't actually in the scene with Marion, it's there, included in the set so you can play Indy having found it, the Germans claiming it from him and then dropping Marion down with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set was a lot of fun to put together and then display with lots of little details in it. So it was well worth picking up and getting.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p>Pros:</p>

<li>The pull pin to make the anubises fall and break the wall 
<li>Breakable wall 
<li>Arch</li></ul>

<li>The fire is a wierd shade of orange 
<li>Mine came with an Anikan (I think that's how you spell his name) Skywalker head that was supposed to be for Indy</li></ul>
