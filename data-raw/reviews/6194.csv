pros
nazis
great uniforms 4 the nazis
truck
jeep
gold treasure chest (lost ark which isn't shiny)
 
cons
peach skin (i like classic better)
truck end is a bit 2 short

"Doctor_Sinister","2007-12-15T10:54:48.153Z","100% brilliant.","I absolutely adore this set - you get four really cool minifigs, some weapons, a GOLD crate, lots of nice pieces and TWO - count them - TWO military vehicles! And the price isn't too bad either - &#163;24.99.

I will definitely be buying at least one more of these for the troops and vehicles.

The mudguards and wheelarches are masterfully crafted with little &quot;wing&quot; pieces. The entire chassis of both vehicles are built up from plates - aside from the cabin base in the truck, there are NO juniorised parts here. Note also the silver 1x1 studs - there are a LOT of these, at the side they look like suspension springs.  No specialised pieces for those here, it's really nicely done IMO.

The canvas hood to the rear is attached with technic pins and held in place by a new piece I personally haven't seen before

The Afrika Korps torso is excellent and will be mega-useful I'm sure for military builders like myself, but one word of warning - that little patch of skin showing beneath the shirt is peachy-fleshie skin, NOT yellow!

It has instantly gone to the top of my list as favourite set ever.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The minifigs themselves are very well detail, and Indy himself is just so cool. 

For me, as a child of the 80's, seeing Indy and Lego together is just a awesome marriage of imagery.

This was the first set I got for my Indiana Jones collection and I can't imagine a better army builder set then this one! This set is one of my favorites but it should come with one more (just one more) soldier minifigure. Anyway let us start with some of the special features this set comes with!
- 4 Minifigures including: 3 soldiers, and Indiana Jones
- 2 (count them!) 2 army vehicles (one including a machine gun)
- Golden treasure chest 
- 4 Diamonds (2 green, 1 red, and 1 blue)
- 4 Golden coins
- white horse with gray saddle
- a pistol 
- Shotgun that fits nicely to the Jeeps side
- Canvas (i don't know what else to call it) that goes over the Hauling truck

So accurate and in proportion that is somehow bypasses some SW lego sets! Love the horse, but the color isn't white-its brown!

The jeep is pretty utilitarian, and I like the simple turret plus the spare tire. The classic horses are always fun to own. However, I wonder why Lego didn't include an actual Ark as they did with the Lost Tomb set. Anyway, the shiny gold treasure chest is pretty unique as well. As for minifigs, I'm very happy every set in the Indy line includes an Indy figure, and three Nazi soldiers in generic khaki uniforms is a pretty good deal.

"Carl_Sagan","2008-05-08T01:44:25.997Z","7622-Review by Carl Sagan","I have this set, but there is no point in me reviewing seeing as there are already two pages worth of reviews. I am reviewing this set in part because it a, deserves recognition, and b, has some very ominous indicators.

I urge the reader to go to lego.com, go to the 'themes' page, and count the number of themes that are based on movies and tv shows. Now, compare this number to the themes based on original concepts of TLC, and perhaps you will start to get the trend of what I am trying to say. It seems that lego as a company is reliant on media production for its own financial success. 

There is of course, nothing wrong with that... who can blame lego for smelling the money? I have to say I enjoy the Indiana sets myself, and when those sets don't receive as much attention in a few months from now, lego will probably have had a good run with the theme, and we, the lego addicts that we are, will enjoy some of the fruit as well. 

But what will happen when Star Wars is no longer a theme, what will lego do then? take a look at the browse menu, you will see that on the first page of 'most owned' that every set but one is Star Wars, the case is similar with the most anticipated page, star wars is also the first tab under favorite themes. 

Legally, lego cannot market any more star wars sets past 2012, but I'm not that worried about lego, already it is starting to get less popular. It seems like four years is a long time, but lego has been selling Star Wars for the past ten years. 

Obviously the real tie-in with all of this talk is financial worry. But I'm not worried because even with these themes derived from the media, It's all about the interpretation of the brand as an awesome lego set (like this one). Seems to me like thats mostly what lego is all, but i dont think I have to argue that sets like city are more original than the X-wing.

Bottomline: don't worry about it, because this set is cool anyway, and lego is the perfect system, It's never all-bad or all good. Get this set because it does explore cool new concepts like fenders, headlight design, and other designs that give me nostalgia for the adventurers sets. If you do end up getting this set, get the motorcycle chase too, It all goes towards building up your army of treasure hunters.

"legoguysw","2008-06-01T14:34:01.403Z","Go Lego Indiana Jones!","This is a great set, a great way to start off the new Indiana Jones theme. You can almost here the classic Indiana Jones theme going on in the distance…One of the best parts of this set is the detail, but lets get the review started so I can show you them.
First off, the all important Minifigs. We have, of course, Indiana Jones, and then 2 Nazis, and... Belloq? That’s what it says in the January 08 Lego catalogue, i think it's changed in the latest one... ...yes, it has. Now he's recognised as 'Guard', and strangely the other two which are very similar to each other are recognised as 'Guard X2'. The Nazis are very good, in a tan uniform colour, good for army builders. Indy is the same as other sets, with his hat whip and shoulder bag, which I used for my Sig Fig. We also get a horse, with a new (to me, at least) thing that fig stands on when riding, which has hooks on either side for a gun and whip. Talking of guns, mine came with 3, one long one and 2 short Han Solo style ones, whereas the inventory says there should only be ONE 'Han Solo gun' and one long one. Not that i have a problem with that, though, in fact I… :D
There’s also a treasure chest included, which is meant to be the 'Stolen Treasure' stated in the set title. So yeah, it isn't the Ark, but that has some Biblical value, and is already in another set. And the treasure chest is golden, cool. It has gold coins and diamonds in it, another plus to this set. I put some of the spare flat silver 1X1 pieces from this set in there to add to the treasury.
Now, the vehicles. The smaller one, the jeep, looks like a display model. It’s so beautiful, I have fallen in love with it. Detail, that’s why. From the mudguards to the from the engine thing on the front to the spare wheel on the back, from the mudguards by the wheels to the wind screen on top, this is pure class. It’s 6 studs wide, just the right size for the vehicle. There are headlights on the front, and side mirrors on the, um, sides.  The right side mirror (that is if you are looking from the front) has one of the long guns in it, a good storage place, or you could just use it as an aerial. The mudguards are brilliant, they are basically the flat flag pieces, but still do (more than) the job. There is a little ‘step’ on each side of the car between each of the mudguards, a simple detail with a big effect. It makes the whole thing look much nicer. Behind the drivers seat, which is 4 studs wide, is a small space for the gunner. There is a barrier at the front of this on which sit’s the gun, which is basically a Lightsaber hilt on a piece a bit like the BIG blasters/the cameras. It looks really good. Around the gunners space or those small seat pieces, I don’t know how to describe it. Basically it’s cool. Finally, there’s a little silver stud atop where the engine is, which I feel finishes it off well.
OK, next to the truck, which actually isn’t the best part of the set, cause its equally good as the rest. (but it is still superb!). We’ll start at the front. The very front bit is the gate thing, I don’t know what you call it, it’s basically that thing that big 4X4 trucks have that’s a bit like a gate (and believe me, wrecks a car when it hits one! : P). Anyway, it looks great. Now, we have another little silver stud atop the grill thing, which is actually very necessary, cause in the movie Indy is on the front of the truck and as he clings on he bends it right back. That’s today’s history lesson for you! So, it is a nice touch, and would you believe it; a single stud took up almost 4 lines! :D Next, we have the grill, which is actually two pieces as a  small bit, the thing that’s basically the bars in the grill fits into it, like a plastic Lego glass pane fits into a window. I’m sure this has been used in a castle set as a window, I don’t which usage the piece was originally made for. Next to the grill are the headlights, which were also used in the jeep, so no explanation needed there. Wheels are under these, and, like the jeep, the headlights are connected to the same piece the mudguards are connected two, nice work there designers! The rubber bits on the wheels  are bigger than the jeep ones, and come out more, no problem there. The designers have used a technique they, assuming they are the same designers, used in the Greivous StarShip set, which is put a curving piece over some tiles to get a cool effect without have to create specially curved tiles. This has more of an effect in the StarShip, but still looks cool here. On top of this, the piece which is the curved piece I was talking about (my reviews are so long you lose track easily!). This makes the truck look more sleek, and good looking. 
The next part of the truck is the cockpit, which is great (how many times have I used that word in this review? I think that the fact that the answer is ‘lots’ shows I like this set). It is a fairly new piece to me, which starts as 4 studs wide, and finishes as 4 studs wide. It’s the middle part that is interesting! At an angle, it looks like an ordinary piece, which is good. But the piece can actually hold two Minifigs, and has doors, sadly which don’t open, but that doesn’t really matter. Anyway, it sort of comes out at the sides, so two Minifigs can sit in it. At the back of the piece, which is raised, are two bits that resemble the backs of seats, which look very nice. You can put a steering wheel in there as well, not that that isn’t already in the set. In between the seats is a small bumpy bit, which I assume is meant to be where the gear stick goes, though there isn’t such a thing in the set. The piece really helps the truck adjust from 4 studs to 6 studs wide.
The windscreen is nothing new. The roof of the cockpit has two 1X2 grill pieces, which strangely make the set feel a bit… meagablockish. So does the cockpit piece, strangely. The roof is supported partly at the back by 2 of those pieces that others snap onto… basically its 1X1 and supports the roof.
I can now skip quickly through the rest, as it is very simple. The back part, where our stolen treasure is stored. At the back of this place is an arch, which sadly at the other end is covered up by a wall. I think with some modification at least some of the wall here could be cleared. Anyway, the back part itself does not fit the treasure chest with it fitting sideways, but by putting  a  1or2X4 brick underneath the handles on the sides go over the side of the truck, enabling it to fit safely in there so you can put Nazis there like in the movie! The canvas over the top is paper, I don’t know if it has been found to be plastic in some cases, though I have heard rumours of it. The canvas goes up a bit at the back, which slightly spoils the set. I don’t know why that is, it SHOULD go straight but for some reason it goes up… never mind. The canvas is attached by blue Technic pins that go through holes in the canvas and into a long brick with holes in it, alcove red up by pieces on click hinges, with look really cool and neat, like in the movie!
Wow, we’ve come to the end of this super long review! Thank you for reading. This set seems a bit overpriced, but through in an extra Nazi and I think it’ll be worth the &#163;24.99 I paid! GET THIS SET: YOUR INDIANA JONES COLLECTION IS NOTHING WITHOUT THIS! It works very well with Adventurers sets as well, so it’s a definitive a buy for Johnny Thunder fans. Get this now!

Both of the vehicles are very well built, being wide, my favorite part of a vehicle.  Both are very classic looking, and really do justice to the original vehicles in the movie.

The overall deal is great being that you get 4 minifigs, two large vehicles, a horse, and a smattering of weapons.

I like that they called the set &quot;Race for the Stolen Treasure,&quot; but anyone who knows the movies, knows that this golden box is clearly the Ark of the Covenant.  I am sure that Lego tried to stay away from any of the religious tones of the movies, and stay with the action.  I do however thank Lego for going out of their way and actually giving us a golden chest when they could have just as easily thrown in a standard brown chest.

The three &quot;Nazi&quot; minifigs are great too.  Each has a different face, and some pretty great expressions.  Gotta love that Lego men have evolved the five o'clock shadow and facial hair.

I love the design of both vehicles, they look great and very realistic. I like the cloth canopy for the larger truck, it's perfect. Besides the totally awesome cars, the set includes 2 revolvers and a rifle, Indy and his horse, and the never before seen GOLDEN treasure chest (full of treasure, of course). One thing I found interesting was the fact that this set came with a lot of little 1X1 studs in a shiny silver color. That's pretty cool, because it comes with 2 of those silver studs as extra pieces so you can use them on your own creations immediately.

"DVDWow","2008-05-31T21:58:15.92Z","Very solid Indy set","I picked this one up at Target while it was 10% off this week, and I have to say, overall I'm very pleased with the set.

First off, both trucks were a pleasure to build, and they both look great and very much like they do in the movie. The tarp over the larger truck is a good aesthetic choice, but I worry about it ripping as it's pretty cheap material. The smaller truck's machine gun turret is awesome, and clearly a very clever design by LEGO, as it seems to be the focus of a lot of the reviews here. Also with a little bit of effort, you can fit two minifigs in the larger truck (plus a few in the back), but it requires some interesting arm angles.

Indy, is of course, great. He's got a whip and a pistol and his horse. As mentioned in prior reviews, his horse is not white in the movie, but that's easily fixable if you have a brown horse lying around, but still a puzzling choice by LEGO when everything else is near-perfect.

Also, the treasure chest is really a letdown with just some gold and gems inside. Additionally, the box show a lot more gold then comes with the set (there are only 4 gold pieces), but that's sort of par for the course with some of the box art.

Probably best of all is the fact this set comes with 4 minifigs (Indy + 3 &quot;Nazis&quot;), which makes up for the small piece count otherwise for the set. The set has a lot of playability and is a lot of fun to reenact the scene with your LEGO minifigs and vehicles.

It features a truck, a jeep, a white horse and 4 minifigs including of course Indy and all his gear. The truck looks very very close to the one in the movie down to the cloth cover, the opening sides, the grille with a silver stud on top where Indy was hanging on and the front guard. It even has hook pieces where Indy can hold on while the truck is moving. The jeep is just awesome and full of little details like a place to attach a rifle, a gun turret, steps for getting in the vehicle, mudguards and an old-style grille like they had in the 1930s. There are  many ways to position Indy and make up any action scenes you want. The bad guys come in 2 different faces. They looked almost too nice to me though, so I used the growly/mean faces from other sets. Their outfits look great and really detailed. <br><br>There are tons of accessories in the set, including guns, rifles, a treasure chest filled with gems and gold pieces and even a saddle with a hook for Indy's horse. There are also plenty of special and rare lego pieces to use and reuse and collect. You just can't go wrong with this set and with 2 great vehicles and a horse you can have tons of other action-packed adventures if one day you ever get tired of Indy (but who would?!!). The construction is fairly easy but still fun and the extra pieces allow you to build any new vehicles you want. And for the collectors, displaying it will just make your friends drool! <br><br>Even my mom who is not an Indy or even lego fan likes to look at my set! So don't look at the price per piece.

"silent_help","2008-08-29T14:51:00.437Z","Solid military set.","This is a great set, for military, Indiana, and vehicle fans alike. It has four figures, two cars, and one white horse.

     The set comes with only one rifle and one pistol so unless you use the machine gun on the jeep or get an extra pistol the set does not come with enough guns to arm all the guards. The guards themselve have a very nice torso and kepi. However the torsos do have flesh colors on them, right below the neck. So, if are wanting to convert them to yellow keep that in mind. The Indiana Jones figure is very good for parts if you multiples of him. The whip, hat, bag, and legs can be used to customise other figures. 

     By far the highlight of the set is the truck and jeep. I'll start with the truck. Looking good from various angles the truck has weakness's although there are very few. Coming from the side the tuck looks a little short although it is not bad, and is more than offset with the ability to see pretty silver shocks that don't work. Also the minifgs when set up beside the truck look short. Althought that isn't a major problem because you will most likely keep them in the truck so you can drive it around. Which I might add the figures look very good in the two figure wide front seat. It has enough room to put multiple figures in the back and still look comfortable.

     The jeep is another well designed vehicle with a construction similar to the trucks. It is tall like thhe truck so they go well together, it is designed for only one figure to sit in the front. While it is feasible to fit three figure in the back I'd suggest no more than two otherwise it looks crowded. Because of the lighter gray used in this jeep it stands out from the truck. So it's hard to confuse them.

    Treasure! Looks very pretty in the sparkly gold chest. Two green gems compliment the four gold pieces. (Five if you are smart.) And the georgeous white horse with the grey saddle finish this set up very nicely. 4 out of 5 stars.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2010-11-06T15:31:56.64Z","The Set That Glorifies LEGO Indiana Jones","I am a complete history freak, especially modern history. I like the Indiana Jones movies very much, but they are not without their faults. The two films involving the Nazis madly chasing after some ancient sacred relic get several things wrong. These errors transitioned into the LEGO Indiana Jones line. Still, these are truly nit-picky, whiny qualms of mine. As far as the movies go, they are quite entertaining, and as far as LEGO Indiana Jones goes, ""Race of the Stolen Treasure"" is a mighty set. Here's why.<div><br></div><div>PROS</div><div>As with many of my reviews, I love reviewing the Minifigures that come in the set. No exception for this set, as I just love the figures. Probably rightly, the Indiana Jones figure is present in every single set in the line. LEGO makes up for this repetitiveness by designing different versions of the Indiana Jones figure, but the one in this set is by far the most common. Still, I have to list the Indiana Jones figure as a Pro simply because he is truly a fine figure. Pioneering LEGO's new ""satchel"" piece and with the new Fedora hat, there is truly nothing I have to complain about the figure. His horse is an excellent addition as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Easily though, the best Minifigures in this set are the German Soldiers. Fortunately, the films get German Soldiers in their desert uniforms pretty spot-on, and despite LEGO's seemingly ""anti-swastika"" policy, the figures still look amazing and intimidating. The tan Kepi pieces are wonderful, as well as the torso pieces which give the three soldiers a good uniform look. They even look better when deployed or driving their vehicles.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The next big Pro are the vehicles. Everyone agrees the two army vehicles make the set; and they do. The ""covered truck"" as LEGO put it is definitely the best. There is plenty of room in the back section of the truck to put whatever you want inside it. I would've liked to see some kind of barrier protecting the back of the truck instead of leaving it open for Indy to slip in and grab the treasure, but if that were the case, playability may have been reduced (or increased depending on your view). The truck also has room for two of the soldiers to sit in the front, and you can actually put all three in the back of the truck (if you remove the treasure I mean). Also, LEGO managed to make the truck look very true to the time-period, and it possesses a very, if I may, ""German"" look to it. The golden treasure chest that goes in it, though it isn't the Ark of the Covenant like in the movie, &nbsp;is a beautiful feature and looks wonderful in the back of the truck.</div><div><br></div><div>The escort car/jeep is another great addition to the set, even if such vehicles were almost never used by the Germans. It has a very rugged look to it, and the mounted machine gun is a great feature on the vehicle. I am very pleased with the black ""lightsaber hilt"" attached to the ""camera"" piece. It gives it a deadly look. With the three soldiers in their respectable positions in the set, the two vehicles look wonderful together.</div><div><br></div><div>CONS</div><div>This set has plenty of Cons. One of them is the instructions. The soldiers in the instructions have brown gloves rather than flesh hands. I like both combinations, but I just wished LEGO had made the instructions true to the pieces. Also, I am somewhat iffy about listing this Con, but the set image shows the German Soldier driving the truck with the revolver pistol, but in the instructions, it says to give it to Indy. I like giving it to Indy IMO, since Indiana did have a revolver in the movies, and since German soldiers during prewar Germany and Germany in WWII NEVER used revolvers. Still, I like all of my soldiers to have some weapon. The soldier driving the jeep gets the grey rifle, the one in the back mans the machine gun, and I would at least like to give the soldier driving the truck to have a pistol. Oh well, minor Cons in the end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CONCLUSION</div><div>Do not let my whining about historical accuracy and my tiny dislikes with this set fool you. ""Race for the Stolen Treasure"" is easily the best set in LEGO Indiana Jones series of toys, and it ranks as one of my all time favorite sets. This set caused me to get into the movies. Even if you are not a fan of Indiana Jones, get this set. It is well worth it and its playability factor is very high. 5/5, final score.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You start off my assmebling the figures (obviously) and then the horse,(placing the saddle on) then the smaller of the two cars. I thought it was a neat Idea to use the rear view mirriors as a place to store one of the Germans gun. The larger truck is last. I just love how many playability features and cool parts are on this. It was very exciting to get a shiny golden treasure chest and all those jewels and coins! Plus you could put indy under the truck, and there are many hand holds and what not to replicate the chase seen in the movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figures are amazing. I bought this set, two of the motorcylye chase set, and found some other tan body peices, and I now have a german army. It was cool to get the soldiers and Indiana jones was nothing new. I actually have nine or ten Indiana joneses. And upon reccomendation from a friend, I took all except one of those apart to build custom figures and such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is no longer avaible, but can still be bought from amazon or ebay for a pretty penny. This may not be a set for you, but I have had hours upon hours of enjoyment loading troops on it, sending them to battle, and carrying cargo. Also, a side note, the cloth canopy on the back of the large truck is held on loosely by 4 1x1 technic pins and can easily be removed, then you can put four figures back there facing outwards to shot to the sides of a vechile. I would reccomend this to a friend, and in fact, I have! Thanks for reading!</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"AETerry","2011-04-22T15:31:31.233Z","Race for the Stolen Treasure Review","<p>At first I was confused trying to remember what movie this scene's from and all I could remember was shouldn't there also be a tank too? And then it hit me, that gold chest should be the Ark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That aside, this is still a great and fun little set. This is the first LEGO set I've seen featuring a gold chest, so that was fun. You've got 4 minifigures and a white horse. And then two vehciles, the transport truck and a smaller jeep offering escort and protection for the treasure as Indy boldy comes riding up on a horse to steal back the treasure/Ark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The builds are solid fun and decent and like all of the Indiana Jones sets, they've all been well worth picking up and geting. I'd still want a tank, re-enact Indy loosing his hat and running to get it before it's ground under the tank treads.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

"RaiderOfTheLostBrick","2020-01-17T00:25:09.813Z","We Need More of These!","<p>Today, secondhand Lego Indiana Jones can leave an empty wallet to the buyer. I was very fortunate to get a few of them when the line was available and Race for the Stolen Treasure is one of the two which is&nbsp;still in one piece. While this is my favourite moment from the franchise,&nbsp;is it worth keeping it that way?</p>

<p>The Good:</p>

<p>This is one of the very few sets Lego has made that features military figures and vehicles. The three German soldiers are certainly very welcome and I have used them for a number of WWII dioramas. In addition their torsos are very detailed for 2008. Indy is a necessary addition, but he comes in all the other sets anyway.</p>

<p>The builds are also exceptional. They are very accurate to Raiders of the Lost Ark and pack some very good detail and building techniques. There are also some cool handles on the truck to recreate some stunts from the film.</p>

<p>The Mixed:</p>

<p>The only really annoying thing about this set is the accuracy regarding the treasure. In the film, the cargo was actually the Ark of the Covenant, whereas in this set it&rsquo;s a gold treasure chest. My theory for this is that there was another set in the same wave (The Lost Tomb I think it was called) that had the Ark included. I can therefore forgive the designer&rsquo;s choice to include this chest instead.</p>

<p>As usual, Indy&rsquo;s satchel has some issues fitting in the truck and horse.</p>

<p>The Bad:</p>

<p>Nothing to see here.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>This is a great set. As we raely get any military sets from Lego, this is welcome enough. The figures are excellent for 2008, builds are fun to build and highly detailed and there is plenty of room to recreate moments from the scene. With Indy 5 on the way, I really hope this set can be remade given it&rsquo;s iconicity and plenty of room for play. Therefore, out of every Indiana Jones sets&nbsp;I own (This, 7620, 7197 and 7626) this is the best! 5/5</p>
