"ngclarkiv","2008-02-05T20:10:32.2Z","Temple Escape: a nice touch","I have recently just bought this set and probably my most favorite part of the whole thing is the figure Indiana Jones.  When I first bought this set and built it, I wasn't quite stunned or thought it was one of the best sets I owned but it does bring a nice touch to my collection.  I think it is more of a set built for youngsters to play with because it only 554 pieces to build with and its easy to build.  So if you are a collector and are looking into get this set, don't be prepared to be amazed.  The stone and door do not work the greatest although the stones falling from where Indy grasps the golden idol is not bad.. I give it three because I fealt that it didn't meet my needs as a collector. However if you want to relive the first scene of Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark it is a great set and I personally suggest that you buy it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"lego12","2008-04-30T19:39:32.543Z"," This set is awesome!"," The set has a TON of pros so let me give you a list....
 
  Pros

1. The Bi-plane is really cool.
2. All the traps are nicely built and work well....except for one...
3. The golden idol is really cool and its rare.
4. The boulder is a rare piece.
5. The spiders and bats are cool.
6. It gives you lots of leaves.
7. It has 2 skeletons, Indiana Jones, Belloq, Satipo, and Jock(the person who flies the plane).
8. It has TONS of playability.
9. It has six traps.
10. It has a good amount of gold coins.

  The traps include: The swinging knives(later used for skeleton swords for the Castle series), the boulder, the closing door, the big gap or hole, the flicking spears, and the tumbling rocks that fall when the idol is removed.

  Now there are some cons.....

   Cons

1. The spider web is in the way of the passage so Indy can't get through.
2. The Bi-plane can't fit Indy unless you remove his backpack.
3. They didn't include a native(indian) in the set.
4. The set is overpriced by $10.00.
5. The closing door closes too fast, but its the best they could do.
 
  Those are the only cons and this set has a lot more pros than cons and it is a fun set to play with and to look at. Thanks for reading this review and I hope you enjoyed it!

"DVDWow","2008-06-05T09:03:27.623Z","A Fun, Huge Indy Set, With A Few Flaws","The biggest of the classic Indiana Jones sets is simply wonderful in recreating the arguably most famous scene from the original. This set has a pretty low piece count for the amount you spend, but it uses the pieces extremely well, and has a superb artistic design and numerous traps.

Now the traps, despite including the famous boulder chase and numerous other clever traps straight from the movie, work mediocre at best. They fall under &quot;work better in theory than in practice.&quot; The boulder while clearly the cornerstone of this set, is quite figidity, and requires a lot of effort to get it set up correctly, and the falling door that allows the boulder to fall doesn't always stay up symmetrically due to the way the lever is set up. I did like the falling &quot;rocks&quot; when you steal the treasure at the end of the temple though, and it works wonderfully. 

Another odd choice by LEGO was to have a bunch of coins just lying around the set. I just opted to remove them as it's difficult to move the display without knocking them all over the place.

Also the display is unusually bulky especially in terms of its length. It's one of the longest sets I own, and has quite a bit of filler space at certain points. I don't particularly like how the set takes a 45-degree turn 2/3 of the way through, as it makes it difficult to display in my setup.

The Biplane is superb, and is easily one of the best planes LEGO has come out with. Indy doesn't fit in it with his bag, but that's easily fixed. 

One of the best parts of this set is just the sheer number of minifigs it comes with including Indy, Jock, Satipo and Belloq as well as a few skeletons.

Building the set overall was a very positive experience, though it was difficult to build some parts of it while the baseplates were connected by the somewhat flimsy hinges. Part of the problem for me was that I don't have a large enough hard surface to build on, but it was easily solved by hinging together the set at the end. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this set, but it has too many flimsy traps, doesn't display easily, and is a difficult assembly to rate it with a 5. Obviously, this set is a must have for Indy enthusiasts, especially those of the classic films, but it's also too overpriced for the number of pieces included.

I'm not a fan of action gimmicks, being more interested in more complicated adult-oriented designs, but I AM a fan of Indiana Jones, so I had to have this set. I do acknowledge that as action gimmicks go, these ones are actually pretty good. I like the way when the door drops down it tips the boulder over.

First you get 5 bags of parts, 1 bag 1, 1 bag 2, 2 bag 3's, and 1 bag 4. Bag one builds the minifigs, and plane. You get 4 minifigs, and 2 skeletons. The minifigs are Indy (of course), Jock, Belloq, and Satipo. Only Jock has back printing, and it says ""Air Pirates"". I find it funny how the plane says OB-CPO (Obi Wan, and C-3PO). Jock even has his fishing pole. Bag 2 builds the entrance to the temple. There is not much to talk about there. Bag 3 builds the middle of the temple. You get 2 blades that swing down, and the boulder. To activate the boulder you close the door, and it has a piece that hits the boulder, and then it starts rolling. You also get where Indy walks across to get to the idol. Bag 4 builds the end of the temple. That includes the idol, you pull that up and a wall collapses, and two 2x2 round bricks come crashing down.  When you put it all together it is freaking huge. It is quite large, 21 inches to be exact. It took me about 2.5 hours to complete. I built it while watching Raiders Of The Lost Arc.

<p>Indiana Jones, is obviously in every set. This set is no different. He comes with a whip and and that is about it. He has his leather jacket and his fedora. He also has a rubery side bag, which is very neat. His whip can fold out just like in the movie ;P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Satipo:</strong></p>
<p>This figure only ever appears in this set. He was with Indy at the start, but obviously he turns evil and he dosn't throw him the whip, like he promised he would. He has a very unique torso and that is about it. His face is the same as the majority of the other German Soldiers. His hair is also the same hair piece as Harry Potters. It would of been nice if they made him a little more unique, by making a printed back for this figure of maybe spiders on his back?? That would of been nice. A tourch is also included for this figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dr Renee Belloq:</strong></p>
<p>This figure is exclusive. He has a very nice looking jungle outfit, including his torso and his beanie. His Beanie is the same as Dr Henry Jones, just a different colour. This figure is one of the main characters in Raiders Of The Last Ark movie, but sadly this is the only set he is in. This figure does come with a revolver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jock:</strong></p>
<p>He is a pretty rare fig. He is the guy that owns the biplane in the movie and ofcourse in this set. He is the only minifig in this set that has printed back. On his back it says ""Air Pirates"" which is exactly like in the movie :D He as a pretty simple smiley face, which I think is new. It's not Luke Skywalkers face by any chance. He also&nbsp;has a fishing rodd which I also think is exclusive. He also has a pet snake which is placed in the biplane, like in the movie</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Skeletons:</strong></p>
<p>There are 2 skeletons included in this set, one that comes with a spear, which should be placed near the spider web and th other one should be placed near the 3 spikes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biplane:</strong></p>
<p>This is Jock's biplane, in the movie. The biplane is slightly different to 7198 biplane. There is not much to say about the plane, it has some stickers and ofcourse it has a green snake inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Temple:</strong></p>
<p>The temple has&nbsp;a sticker on the front, showing some spiders, some plant and a skull piece. Inside there are 2 spiders and a little trap which is supposed to work on Satipo on the way back and thats how he gets killed. There is also a spider web and 2 Skeletons as mentioned above. Then there is the pit. The pit is&nbsp;a bit small, I would have to say. Then there is some spears, representing the darts that are shot in the movie. Except the spears are&nbsp;a bit too big to be used as darts and they fall out unlike the&nbsp;flick-fire missles. Then there is a bat and if you go to the end, there is the golden idol. There is also a set of coins on there.&nbsp;The golden idol is an exclusive piece and it's only in this set. To activate the idol play feature, you have to take the whole bar piece out with the idol attached to it. Not just the idol piece, but the whole bar. Then what that does, just like in the movie, it drops 2 rocks. There is also a lever that when you push up on, it closes the door. Now the problem is, not only the door closes way&nbsp;too fast, but&nbsp;also at the same time, when the door closes it also activates the boulder.&nbsp;Both the&nbsp;door and the boulder are way too fast for Indy, but still it's nice that they went to all that detail. Another accurate thing is that the boulder dosn't fit through the&nbsp;door ;P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>This is a good set to get, both the play features and the figures are really good and I really like the movie scene, which was one of the main reasons I bought this set. If you want this set, go a head and get it now, it's deffinetely worth it for about $60USD to $80USD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>- Lots of&nbsp;animals and accessories</p>
<p>- 3 exclusive figures</p>
<p>- Lots of play features</p>
<p>- Lots of exclusive parts, such as the boulder piece and the golden idol</p>
<p>- 5 gaint base plates (good for mocs)</p>
<p>- Good value for the piece amount</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;You have to take the whole bar out to activate the idol mechanism instead of just the idol</p>

"Brickdroid","2012-11-16T21:17:47.297Z","A Good Set for a Famous Scene!","<p>Indiana Jones took the movie theaters by storm in 1981 with the release of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", so it is only fitting that Indy get's his own line of lego sets! When this set was released in 2008, I was in elementary school, I remember saving up every bit of my precious allowance for months so I could buy this set. &nbsp;As soon as I got enough money, I rushed straight to my nearest Wal-Mart and purchased this set. &nbsp;So let's don the fedora, pick up the whip, and take a look at this famous scene, brick by brick!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The packaging was pretty standard for the time, with an exciting action scene on the front cover, and the back showing most of the play features for the set. &nbsp;The instructions, like all sets in the Indiana Jones series, were printed to look like one of Dr. Jones' diaries, and were quite easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>For the most part, the parts in this set were pretty standard. Aside from some neat green-and-grey mountain pieces, which can be good for MOC's, the golden idol, and 4 grey dinousarus, the pieces contained in this set were common.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The Indiana Jones minifigure in this set is the standard Indy from the early batch of sets, but he looks exactly like the adventurer, and even comes with Indy's famous whip and fedora. &nbsp;Satipo is a minifigure exclusive to this set, and, apart from his torso, is made up of common pieces. &nbsp;He has the face used for most german soldiers in the Indiana Jones sets, and has Harry Potter's hair. &nbsp;Rene Belloq is another set-exclusive minifig, and is very nice to have, given that he is the main antagonist in the film. &nbsp;For the most part, he DOES look like Belloq in his jungle gear, but I never liked this particular minifig's face. &nbsp;I really just didn't like his sneer, but it certainly could have been worse. Finally, we come to Jock, who is really neat in that he had a very small role in the movie, &nbsp;but is featured in the set anyway. &nbsp;I really liked this minifig, even though he was pretty generic.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The actual construction of this model was very straightforward, and very easy, to the point that there is really nothing more that I can say about it other than the fact that you will have next to no trouble with it.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This set came out looking fantastic, and it will not break easily.&nbsp;Among my favorite features are the lowering door, the scythes coming out of the wall, and, of course, the rolling boulder!&nbsp; The sheer amount of booby traps that they were able to fit into this single set was astounding, and it represents the temple well from the movie.</div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: bold; "">Summary</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space: pre; "">	</span>This model came out very well, extremely if you are looking for playability. Due to the simple construction, this is a very robust set, which is good. There are very few things that could go wrong and break. &nbsp;It is perfect if your looking for a set that represents this iconic scene in film history, and can be played with, too. &nbsp;This is a fantastic set, and is highly recommended to all Indiana Jones fans, and people who just want a fun set.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4
