I bought only one and it made 5 people have weapons and helmets. Only one thing missing. The chest armor w/ the knights helmet. But all in all its very good. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-07T22:21:39Z","Almost flawless","This is an amazing accessories pack. Of course, what accessories pack was flawed? Anyways, This gets you all the castle elements you really need. It gives you almost every minifig accessories ever used in a set. It even gives you the Ninja accessories!

The only flaw in this is that there is no Samurai armor. The Samurai armor is probabally one of the best armor pieces ever made. It would also be nice if it had a simitar as well. Aside from this however, this set is flawless.

"Gus_263","2008-06-27T14:38:31.873Z","Useful additions to your castle minifigures","This set is from the &quot;Bulk bricks&quot; theme, and is a part of the Castle subtheme. Released in the year of 2002, this set features additions (weapons and other pieces to add your castle minifigures), with some likeness with the castle theme from 2000-2001, the first knights kingdom subtheme, altough also have additions from other subthemes, like the wizard's blue hat, ninja's cover, katana, the batlord's sword, shogun's helmet and the wolfpack and forestmen's hats and helms.

Some notable weapons are the spear, crossbow, swords (a normal sword and a silver sword from the batlord), two different axes, a longbow, a crossbow, a joust spear and two katanas. At all this weapon variety can increase very well a castle collection.

Also, this set features other elements such the different helmets and &quot;feathers&quot; pieces (with the red color), and &quot;horns&quot; pieces (with white color, common among the &quot;bull knights&quot; from knights kingdom), to increase any helmet. So much helmets are included, and also there are two shields, one from lion knights and other from bull knights. Also, the set includes a golden and chrome painted crown, and a skeleton (from the old version, more playable and realistic than the new).

Overall, this set is one of the most useful from the &quot;Bulk bricks&quot; theme, if you want to increase minifigures, and of course, it is very good for the castle theme. So, if you're a Castle fan, this is a good set for you, can increase any collection. So, if you buy it by a decent price (maybe like the impulse sets or few more or less), you'll be receiving so much stuff to add in your collection. A 4,9 of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
