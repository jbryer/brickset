i think every big theme such as ex-force does need some mini sets.

Pros:

good minifig
every big theme needs some mini sets
nice carft

Cons:

nothing really, it's good!
accept that really, you mite need some more sets to make a game.
*Not as fun on it's own*

over all good 4/5 set! Good going LEGO!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
