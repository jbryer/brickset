"bmwlego","2007-12-26T10:21:04.747Z","Lime Green Parts a Plus!","This was one of three sets included in a Brickmaster mailing and it was the best of the three in my mind. The front of the car looks unfinished because you can see studs but other than that, this is a nice set. The white slopes in the back are great parts as is the windshield slope. The lime green parts are nice and this was a fun set to build. Another good set to come with a Brickmaster subscription.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2008-10-24T18:06:56.75Z","Nice Supercar","This is an unique Tiny Turbo because of the lime green pieces and it looks like a Mercedes CLK GTR or a Maserati MC-12. The clear piece is very cool too. This Tiny Turbo is one of the best in a long time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
