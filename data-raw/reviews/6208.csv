The model looks fine and approximates the design of a hummer quite well. The sloped gray parts in the back of the car are great as is the mudguard. This set and the others mailed along with it can serve as a great starting point for TT MOCs because of the car specific parts included with these sets. This car really seems like a Hot Wheels car until you pick it up and feel how light it is because it is all plastic and not die cast metal. For some reason, LEGO failed to mail me the sets when they first came out. Fortunately I asked about them and received them about 2 weeks later. Just another example of the LEGO commitment to customer care.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
