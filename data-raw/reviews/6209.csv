"frogstudio","2008-03-10T22:19:38.45Z","Awesome set","Another really great set for this year of Castle.  I must say it's the best siege tower ever designed by LEGO.  The only thing I don't like about it are the huge wheels (I really hate this wheel piece, it's so childish!), which I replace for round 4 x 4 bricks.  Minifig selection is great, with two diffrent type of torsos for the orcs and a new armour piece for one of them aswell.  The Crownies tower isn't that great (the prison itself has no back, which is rather stupid), but you can use the pieces for a MOC.  I would advise getting this set, it's worth the price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mike2008","2008-03-19T16:05:45.717Z","It could have been a wonderful set if only it was a stand-alone tower/wizard tower ","Generally, towers are quite rare in the Lego castle system. 
This set would be rated 5 if only it was the tower alone with a wizard or 3 minifigs of soldiers preparing to defend the tower. 

Think of the tower as an outpost at the border of the kingdom or as a wizard tower within the realm studying and protecting its surroundings. 

Well, you cannot have it all.

"greenfrog_7","2008-05-09T02:19:11.827Z","Tower Raid... Siege!","The star of this show is definitely the siege tower, and definitely reduces the impressiveness of the included tower and its figures. The tower itself is smaller than the mobile troll siege tower, which doesn't really make a lot of sense if you want to pick at it. However the set is worth it for the siege tower alone, the battering ram functions, the bridge is great and the construction was interesting.

I feel that LEGO would have liked to include a larger tower section but was forced to reduce the size to make sure that sets were kept to a certain size/price range. Which I understand - and the great part with LEGO is that I am not limited and can easily mix and match these with other sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legobuilderguy","2008-05-31T11:08:14.513Z","Raiding party!!","Okay, had to pick this one up at my local TRU yesterday. What a nice little set. This is one of the sets that made Lego great! In this set you get a nice little tower (with a classic castle piece!!)with 2 knights in residence to watch the prisoner on the 2nd level. Now this is a small tower but still very nice touches which we will get into in a bit. The siege tower is wonderful and the main reason I bought this set to start with. The over sized wheels and the kind of patched together look make this a wonderful addition to the castle series. I know that Lego calls them trolls but they and their emblem remind me of the Orcs from WoW so I call them orcs. On the siege tower you get a battering ram to knock down the tower wall to free the orc prisoner and a small bridge which connects nicely up to the tower wall with a pull out feature which is really nice. Now onto the pros and cons.

Pro's:
3 orc figures
2 knights
brown crossbow and quiver
Orc commander with armor
new handcuffs (mine had 2)
nice little tower

Con's:
Tower is kind of small
not enough orc weapons
knock down wall tends to just fall over

This set is really good all in all. 3 orcs to help build that army and 2 knights with weapons. This looks really nice with the other castle line. The siege tower looks really nice next to the battle wheel and the assualt wagon, set #7038. This is also a great stand alone product as well and should provide hours of fun.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Yloquen","2008-07-14T04:41:05.857Z","Here comes the big bad machine ... ","Set contents:

 - Five minifigs - two crownies and three trolls one of which is a prisoner;
 - A siege engine with a battering ram and a sliding assault bridge for breaching fortifications;
 - A small tower with a prison in it for the captured troll;



Background:

 The evil troll is captured by the crownies and his buddies come with their big, bad machine to smash the royal outpost and release their mate.



Score:

4/5

The siege engine design is good. While I don't particularly like the wheels, they feel right. Wagon wheels would look too flimsy and these have that sturdy, barbaric design that I associate with trolls' building skills - rough but strong. There's a lot of decoration following the same spirit.

The tower is sort of a filler - it's there to provide play value and the elements in it are as many as needed. Not much to talk about in its design - the basement has a hinged wall that the ram can hit and the prison has removable floor, so that the troll can escape to the basement.


What I don't like about the set is the tower to siege engine proportion.I understand that it's a medium sized set, so piece count is limited, but the tower should have been a bit bigger. As it is, it's smaller than the siege engine and that makes the whole set a bit unrealistic as a whole.

However, the proportions do not diminish the play value, so if you are not concerned so much with the aesthetics of the original model, you will probably like the set. There are a lot of useful pieces in it - dark and red brown - for building siege machines and other wooden models, a lot of &quot;barbaric&quot; decoration - tooth-like silver plates, black-glitter wheels and plates simulating roughly forged iron, and some chains.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2009-01-04T15:42:33.467Z","Surprisingly Grand","This set is without a doubt an upgraded version of the old Knights Kingdom siege tower. It's significantly better built, and it also has improved playability functions. When you pull back the battering ram of the siege vehicle and hit the wall of the tower, it falls inwards and causes the floor of the jail cell above to collapse and free the troll. Most of the time, complicated maneuvers such as this fail miserably. However, this one actually succeeds at working the majority of the time. Anyway, the top of the tower has a gold crystal, and for some inexplicable reason flick-fire missiles, which (according to Lego) apparently existed in medieval times. ",FALSE,4,3,3,4,4

Plus+
     Nice characters. Two knights, three trolls. The tower is actually taller than the siege machine thanks to it's flag. It comes with two handcuffs! The battering ram smashes the wall which leans back, triggering the floors collapse which releases the prisoner. Sometimes he slides Down the wall and runs off safely! The third floor houses the gem, table and spare weapon. The top floor is where the flick fire missiles are and the battlements. The flick fire missiles are only usable if you actually flick them with your finger. Then they fire a long way. It has some pre-built battlements and looks great. The siege tower is larger in volume than the tower and looks if it had been built by the lazy trolls they are. It is not very pretty and is not symmetrical. The troll captain has a very nice breastplate which looks trollish and his henchman has full weapons. The flag is much better than the Dwarves mine defender one. The batering ram works ok as does the sliding bridge.

Minus-
      The siege tower dwarfs the tower and is too big. The battering ram swings up and the elastic band falls off often. The sliding bridge is not well positioned to attack either the tower or castle. Also the trolls should have another sword but if you buy Troll warship that is accounted for. The wheels are too big but look like they were made by the trolls. The prison should have another wall so the prisoner can't escape. The bottom layer should have four walls not two. There could be another knight but most sets have too many good guys so what.

Equals=
       A nice small set containing a troll attack machine. Well priced and designed. Great playability and options.   

Compatibility
              Get a troll warrior and dwarves mine defender. Troll warship also goes well with this set. Any set that has walls or large doors also goes well because the siege tower can break through, Kings castle siege is great too.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"legoDad42","2010-04-03T16:56:37.153Z","Excellent Playability!","<p>The Tower Raid is a fantastic Castle-line play set. You have a 4-story prison tower holding a Troll warrior prisoner (guarded by 2 Knights) and a wonderfully designed rolling siege tower (with Troll Warrior and Troll Commander/General). Both models are well made/sturdy and well designed. Excellent playability for your kid and of course the 'kid at heart' AFoL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Prison Tower...</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Well designed, 4-story Prison Tower. Keeps an open layout throughout for playability, ease of use and expansion. Great addition to your large castle's sets.</li>
    <li>From the top-Open parapet with pennants and 2-flick fire missile w/red cone tips(simulating these large arrows being on fire). This weapon is meant to be some kind of ballista.</li>
    <li>Third level-Open layout design containing a table with a large gold crystal atop it. This is meant for additional playability. Perhaps the Troll warrior came to steal the gold and was captured or this is some sacred artifact the Crown Knights must keep from falling into Troll hands, or even this could be used by the Troll Sorceress, etc...keeps the imagination and playability flowing for kid's. Also here we have a clip to the right holding a halberd.</li>
    <li>Second level-The prison cell itself. Bars on 3 sides. Smooth floor. The floor here is not snapped down so it can collapse, releasing the prisoner(s). Note the set comes with 2 sets of handcuffs.</li>
    <li>First floor- Nicely designed door(opens/closes) adorned by 2 torches left and right. The wall adjancent to the door can be pushed in. This wall is what's holding up the prison cell floor above and once pushed in, collapses the prison floor and then your prisoner either slides down and out of the tower or falls back into the first floor looking to flee from the Tower(or perhaps goes back&nbsp;up and gets that lovely gold crystal!).</li>
    <li>Tower has 2 Crown Knights defending it. One with shield and sword (w/Nasal-like helm)and the other with crossbow and quiver (w/Kettle-Hat like helm).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Siege Tower...</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Excellently designed 3 story Siege Tower with rich dark brown/chocolate colored bricks throughout and 4 large, detailed wheels.</li>
    <li>Top level-Protected by 3 armored plates to the front and one on each side(left and right). 2 spikes in the rear and 2 chains adorn the sides as well (both left and right).</li>
    <li>Second level-Here we have a sliding, boarding platform. Uses a small rope/string which hooks underneath and when pulled from the back, slides the platform forward. Works great(!) and easily resets. Excellent feature. Also left and right on this level are 2 large spears with pennants.</li>
    <li>First level-The Battering Ram itself! Dragon-headed design with horn/spikes left and right uses technique pieces and a rubber band to swing the 'Ram' forward, smashing into the collapsing wall of the Tower to help release your fellow Troll prisoner. Pull back with a little tension and it snaps forward beautifully. Works well!</li>
    <li>Siege Tower has 2 Trolls, one warrior with shield and copper-colored sword and one Troll Commander/General with grey sword, copper helmet and body/shoulder armor and of course the aforementioned Troll prisoner(no weapon for him).</li>
    <li>Additionally this tower comes with a very large standard(Troll Skull&nbsp;graphic onto large&nbsp;spear&nbsp;and two pennants)&nbsp;for the commanding Troll to rally his forces.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Suggestion</em>-When standard is not being 'weilded' by a Troll, I suggest using a plate(1x2)w/knob&nbsp;and round brick(1x1) attached to the top, back of Siege Tower and mount the standard there. Gives a great, menacing look!&nbsp;</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2012-02-25T21:44:02.59Z","Siege the day.","<div>Would you like to see a set of extremes? How fortunate for you, you’re looking at one right now! You get two components with Tower Raid: an excellent siege machine populated by a healthy number of Trolls, including a self-styled armoured captain, which is accompanied by a lacklustre, half-finished tower manned by a pair of rather generic human foot soldiers. You tell me which is the good bit and which is slightly less so.</div><div><br></div><div>This is among the first Fantasy Era sets that I purchased, and I was immediately impressed by the quality of the Troll siege tower. In addition to having a slew of features - an extending/retracting platform for crossing over walls, a powerful battering ram powered by a clever elastic band mechanism, and adjustable axes to menace and otherwise maim hapless enemies - the siege tower is also emblematic of the high level of detail that the few Troll sets all possess. The large flag, the diagonal planks of “wood” along the sides, and the carefully arranged spikes all give this lumbering tower of death the feeling of having been hastily cobbled together by, well, by Trolls, and go a long way in establishing a wilderness kind of aesthetic that would not seem out of place in, say, the <i>Might and Magic</i> universe.</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, you have a flimsy outpost whose function is indeterminate since it is unfinished on two adjacent sides and whose crowning turret is oddly exposed from the rear. Now I know that this is meant to facilitate playability, but to me it just doesn’t work. Even taking that aside, the whole tower has a very simplistic build that looks rather kiddish when completed. Even when compared against Drawbridge Defense (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7079-1"">7079</a>), which I already find is somewhat lacking in detail, the outpost just doesn’t work. Outpost Attack from Kingdoms (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7948-1"">7948</a>) does a much better job of this, I feel, sacrificing height in favour of a more fleshed-out second level. Of the two human Minifigs, the crossbowman is certainly the cooler of the two, and he’s worth having since ranged troops are relatively rare overall anyway.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In spite of these shortfalls, though, this set is very much worth having, even if just for the Troll siege machine alone. The Troll Minifigs look great, and the siege machine partners up wonderfully with Troll Assault Wagon (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7038-1"">7038</a>). If the outpost ends up displeasing you, there’s nothing stopping you from cannabilising it for its useful pieces, which I suppose is always one positive aspect of being generic (genericity?

There is also a jail, a room with some gold, and the main floor. The siege tower has an extending bridge, a top platform, and a battering ram on the bottom. When the set is built correctly, the battering ram hits the main level of the tower and the floor above collapses freeing the captured goblin (Lego calls them trolls, but they are more, like goblins).

"Septim_s","2022-03-03T06:48:52.553Z","Nostalgia strikes again","<p>Once again, I got this second-hand since getting one brand new means having to pay frankly absurd prices.</p>

<h3>Instructions/Parts</h3>

<p>Since I got this set second-hand it didn&#39;t come with printed instructions, however the colour accuracy of LEGO&#39;s instructions (at least from what I could tell from the pdf version) left much to be desired.</p>

<p>As for the parts, besides the minifigure accessories, a few notable parts are the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4519210/wheel-%C3%B856x22-w-spokes-lacquer"">wheels</a> of the siege engine, which only appeared in a few sets in this specific colour, and the &quot;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4275857"">wolf&#39;s head</a>&quot; used for the battering ram.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51915124131_c6305b1d07_k.jpg"" style=""width: 1536px; height: 2048px;"" /></p>

<p>The build techniques were nothing spectacular, with the main play feature of the tower being the flick missiles, which LEGO used to include in as many sets as possible before the advent of spring-loaded shooters. The floor above the jail cell has some &quot;treasure&quot; for the human faction to protect (although why there would be treasure in a watchtower visible to everyone in the vicinity is best left unexplained), with the lowermost floor featuring a door that leads to... nothing. Smashing the wall repeatedly will eventually allow the troll prisoner to tumble down to the lower floor, thus escaping.</p>

<p>All in all, it is a simple build which prioritises playability rather than authenticity, which is perfectly acceptable for its intended target audience. In fact, it doesn&#39;t look too bad from most angles, with my only real gripe being the lack of space to place multiple figures on each floor, which does limit its functionality somewhat.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51914154802_def922a7ce_k.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The siege engine fares much better, with ample space for minifigures and a reasonably good battering ram. Personally, I dislike mechanisms reliant on rubber bands, as those tend to be unreliable as the rubber ages, however, leaving the rubber bands off does not really affect play much. The wheels do seem a bit too wide in proportion to the entire build, but they serve their purpose.</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>If you are lucky enough to get one second-hand for a decent price, it is a good set with plenty of play value for kids, especially since both factions are fairly evenly matched. Five minifigures is a decent amount for a $30 set, which seems unheard of today.</p>

<p>Besides the somewhat repetitive build, there ain&#39;t that many negatives about this set, and it has aged remarkably well for something that was released over a decade ago. Not having to apply ANY stickers is also a major selling point, as you don&#39;t have to worry about aligning them perfectly.</p>
