Not a bad happy meal toy, much better than the Bionicle stuff included in Happy Meals now.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Pepper","2011-03-13T18:17:25.957Z","the Hamburglar will steal your hamburgers!","<p>&nbsp;This set was available at McDonalds in Happy Meals back in 1998.&nbsp;It consists of some basic bricks along with a special printed brick with&nbsp;Hamburglar&nbsp;on it that was exclusive to this set. These happy meal sets were my very first legos.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>It includes mostly basic bricks and plates. It also comes with a propeller and an exclusive printed brick. The printed&nbsp;brick has Hamburglar from the shoulders up printed on a normal 33 2x3 red slope brick.</p>
<h4>The plane</h4>
<p>The plane is a very simple build. It has no interesting build techniques, but what can you expect from a happy meal promo?</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This is a below average set. There is nothing overly special about it except for the printed brick, and even that's not that special. I wouldn't reccommend buying it, unless you find it for less than $0.25.</p>",TRUE,2,2,1,2,5
"Lego_mini_fan","2021-07-22T17:07:42.72Z","The hamburglars plane ","<p>Way back in 1999, lego and McDonalds collaborated and produced 8 sets that came with happy meals. Now onto the review! &nbsp;<br />

-Parts&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set consists of 13 parts. Which are 2 green plates, 2 small wheels, 2 black plates, 2 black bricks, a black piece to put the wheels on, 1 black slope, a green&nbsp;technic brick,&nbsp;a yellow propeller and a special red printed slope of the hamburglar from McDonaldland.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
-Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build of this set is simple and no special techniques are being used in the build, but the again this is a happy meal toy</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-summary&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is very simple, and&nbsp;I don&#39;t recommend picking this up unless you get it for a good price or for the printed slope. In my opinion this is better than most of the McDonald&#39;s LEGO toys.</p>
