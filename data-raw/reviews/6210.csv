Though minifgs included are great (though there aren't hand weapons for the dwarf nor shields for none of the minifigs), the vehicle itself isn't a good design.  If I had the chance to go back in time, I wouldnt pay 7 pounds for it...  Sorry TLC, sometimes you nail it, sometines not.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Pro
* The figs are great, My first dwarf, the beard is clever and the evil orcs are amazing. 
* New sword and flag
*Catapult is clever with the pullback chain

Cons
* The spinning blade doesn't work because the wheel doesn't roll. 
* To simple design
* Poor dwarf is defenseless without handweapons.

"Gus_263","2008-04-20T15:51:46.03Z","OK set, but with some problems","This is a set of the castle theme, one of the newest, and this don't have a small size, but it isn't big. The set includes three minifigures, two trolls and a dwarf. The trolls looks like to be silly due to the color and face designs. Some details are good on the armor, but the helmet have a bad used metallic color, it hidden these details. The dwarf must be small to be a dwarf, and the legs are really short, but these cannot moves, is an unuseful piece . And another bad positioned thing is the beard, it is so long for the minifigure, and with it the helm don't fit very well, making the arms be the unic playable things on the minifigure. Altough the minifigures have each problems, the color scheme stay good, and these includes some itens, like the helmets of the trolls, the helm of the dwarf and the sword of a troll. The set also includes a flag from the trolls, well designed and positioned (it fit well in the sticks, altough the flag don't have the previous material, used in other sets). The building involved, in the &quot;vehicle&quot; (it is a catapult with wheels, and in the  same time it features spiked wheels on the front), is made using four wheels with a considerable size, and two long bricks on each side, connecting it to the plate used as a base. The two wheels on the front have a elastic connecting these to the spiked small wheels, and it don't moves well with it, but without, it is worst. The silver small spiked wheels on the front are bad positioned, one to each other, but it makes a good effect in the design. Above some brown colored bricks and plates, making the base, there is the dwarf, where it stay. The position is good for the mini figure, but the legs of the dwarf minifigure aren't playable, and it makes the position bad. Few blocks builted on the front of the dwarf's position are increasing it, and these makes another effect on the design, the dwarf looks like to be more protected. On the side of the dwarf, there is the catapult. It works well, and it is big, features some gold and brown schemes. The playability is good with the catapult, troll minifigures and wheels. The design of the set too still good, altough the trolls looks like to be silly and the dwarf isn't much playable (it only moves the arms, and these are so much big for him, but are in the normal lego shape). Overall, it still good, but the minifigures could be better, and the front of catapult don't shows a good building for current sets, but the price is considerable. In comparison with other sets of the same price, size and theme, it gets 4/5, good but can be better.   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I have many of the same comments as for the Troll Assault Wagon - it feels very minimal and I wish I could have some more pieces added on there to give it some weight and some decorative flare.

Saw blade pieces
Pull chain catapult
Trolls!
Banner!

Cons
Trolls lack weapons/shields
Saw blade mechanism function is mediocre
Dwarf has no hand held weapon/accessory

I love the troll banner. My biggest gripe is that the dwarf did no come with an axe. The pull chain catapult is surprisingly entertaining and I appreciated the tiltable frontal shield assembly on the vehicle. This set has its greatest value in providing 3 minifigs and awesome vehicle parts and a banner!

"rabk295","2008-11-24T09:49:55.64Z","Pretty good...","This set is pretty good. The dwarf is cool and the trolls are also very cool. I am very pleased with the helmets of both races. It is a cool idea to have the rotating blades, but I find that the wheels only rotate well if they're on a rug. Either they should have a tighter rubber band, or they just shouldn't have the blades. The one major problem for me was that the set didn't come with the silver sword it was supposed to, and even though they sent it for free, it was shipped all the way from Denmark. I do very much like the way you fire the catapult with a chain. That adds a bnit of a realistic, good lookng touch to the set. Overall, this set is worth buying and if you have 10 bucks that you don't know what to do with, buy this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-05T08:50:42.7Z","Halt! And prepare to be..",".. disappointed. The trolls are again clones. The flag is cool. The vehicle looks quite ugly though. It looked like a combine harvester they use in fields to harvest grain. Also they shouldnt use a blue rubber band there because it makes the set looks very juniorized. I took apart the combine harvester and built a Dwarve's Mine Assault Wagon - a MOC out of it. I used the blades as wheel (three wheeler) and the four large round pieces as chassic support. All the brown, grey, chains and blades makes the MOC looks somehow steampunk-ish and aesthetically pleasing. (Picture in my MOCPages soon). If you are low on cash and want to get a decent-sized Castle set, this would be it. The dwarf is awesome! Reminds me of the dwarf Gimli from LOTR.

"the_lead_general","2008-11-26T01:00:57.497Z","trolls?    splat     Where?","Dwarves mine defender

Plus+
     Two trolls with weapons, cool mine defender and well designed dwarf. The catapult comes with two chains which can be removed as it fires better that way, plus you have two spare chains. The mine defender goes great with the mine and acts as a body guard.

Minus-
      The troll flag breaks apart, the one in tower raid is better. The blades don't work very well, and the dwarf doesn't come with any weapons. It could come with another dwarf full armed. It is hard to get the dwarves beard off.

Equals=

Pro(s):
 - Two really realistic goblins, and of course the dwarf 
 - The Trollâ„¢ flag
 - A small easy to use Dwarf Miner with fully working functions 
 - Handy additional weapons
 - A Catapult perfect when using your own creations 
Con(s):
 - The Mining spikes on the front of the Dwarf Miner only work on uneven surfaces.
 - Maybe if they added on a few Euro they could put in a small Barracks for the trolls.

Over all I would give it about a 4/5.
Hope this review helps.

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T17:58:39.807Z","Defend the Mine Dwarves","<p>Set # 7040 Dwarves' Mine Defender: I bought this on sale I think... It was a great addition to my Castle themed sets and offered some unique mini-figures from the Fantasy Era. I'm kind of sad to see them all vanish off the shelf so quickly, makes it harder to collect the Fantasy Era stuff, going back to Kingdoms is kind of not the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you get with this set. Two Trolls, a dwarf and a very bulky looking vehicle - something that looks modern and medieval both at the same time. Building it shouldn't take you too long and there really aren't that many tricky parts to it, though some pieces can get in the way when you're trying to build the saw bladed cowcatcher. (That's what I'm calling it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are great, as is anything from the Fantasy Era Castle theme. The Trolls are pretty ugly looking and they come with some very unique helmets and swords. I was greatly impressed by them and they break up the monotony of my army of knights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dwarf is made using the shorter leg piece and the beard is also a nice new touch to my Mini-Figures. I particularly like that it's red and not just black or even grey. I think the Set could be improved upon only by adding weapons for all of the figures, the Dwarf should have had an axe to use to defend his position should the Trolls manage to get past the front saw-bladed cowcatcher thing. And what's up with a Troll Warrior carrying only this massive banner into battle?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still it is a worthy addition to your Castle collection and if you can buy more than one it's a sort of cheap alternative for troop building Trolls. (Minus the fact that only one of them gets a sword.) I recommend this set to any fans of Castle who have been on the fence about the Fantasy Era due to its lack of traditional mini-figures. Also I find the new printing used on these Mini-Figures to be rather impressive compared to the older plain blue or black shirts.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
