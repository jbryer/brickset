"LegoImperialSailor","2008-02-17T14:38:11.78Z","O.K","This set is most definately the best castle set out there, though it is pretty cool. Now on to th review:

Pros-It has a sand-green troll.
     The dragon and knight are awesome. 
     The sails, they give it a evil appearance.
     Lots of trolls.


Cons-Looks too much like the viking ship.
     The net is kinda funky-looking. 
     Having the back mast be the taller one looks somewhat awkward.
     WAY too overprised.

I am gonna give this set a 3/5 because there are just as many pros as cons.

"MEGADETH","2008-03-13T06:13:19.81Z","My fav set on 2008 so far","When buying this set the first thing i'm looking for are actually the armoured dragon and the green troll (or was it orc?), but the warship itself is awesome and well contructed, the prison and the back deck of the ship are both great, there's also a cool weapon contruction on the front of the ship. The number of minifigures contain on this set is great compare to this set size, you also get the small boat as a bonus. finally the orc logo banner is what make this warship looks cool!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legobuilderguy","2008-07-03T03:09:53.403Z","Really great set","Just got this one and have to say this looks great. I wish the sales pictures gave a shot of the ship bow on so you could see how truly nice this one is. Yes, it does look simlair to the Viking Long Boat but only from the width of the vessel and of course it uses the same bow piece as the long boat does. Pro's and con's time.

Pro's: 
6 orcs
1 ogre
nice ship details
another dwarf
a pet rat

Con's:
Sails crinkle easily and wrinkle
only four swords

There have been complaints about the price of this set but I am not sure why. You get a really nice looking vessel, 9, yes NINE mini figures, 2 row boats and some other nice pieces and parts. All in all this is a great set and if you like either the boats or the Castle line this is a winner. Enjoy!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lint","2008-07-17T12:06:59.687Z","Great Naval Set","Pro's
*8 minifigures with accessories!
*Giant Troll with stone club!
*Dragon!
*2 boats
*Spring fire cannon
*Rat!

Con's
*Price
*Lack of common ship accessories, barrels, chests etc
*I would have liked the dwarf to have his own dedicated weapon, the troll captain only gets a whip.

I got this on sale for about $69 AUD so i'm pretty happy with it. I would have felt quite ripped off if I had bought it at full retail price. Overall its a great kit if you're looking for a ship. The mast+sails are rotatable, the prow of the ship has a mean battering ram, you get 2 'raider' boats and the prison cage + net don't hurt. The winding mechanism for raising or lowering the net is a nice touch. The rear platform of the ship can be easily removed to reveal the interior of the cabin which has 4 catches for storing the swords in.

You also get a decent amount of minifigures (compared to similarly priced kits) plus a huge dragon. I would have liked the knight/general to have some difference with the one in 7009 Final Joust, but what the hey, i'm happy that he came in full armour.

Troll army builders will love this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-12-26T19:45:30.593Z","Man, that was some Christmas.","I got this set for Christmas and spent the rest of the day with it. Honestly I don't see how we were all so blind as to the brilliant marketing move on Lego's part: Release nautical sets that use pieces not seen in ten years,  and after observing the reaction, rerelease Pirates. Sheer brilliance. Anyway, enough chitchat. Let's get down to brass tacks.

Pros:
enough figs to fill THREE smaller sets
ballista is way better than '07 design
a blooming DRAGON (VERY rare to say the least)
also rare is the knight general
rowboats!

Cons:
the piece count is closer to the Joker's Ice Cream Surprise, but for $25.00 more (Canadian, that is)
dwarves are more rare than they should be",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"RangerFett","2009-02-01T10:13:29.483Z","Terrific set... when the price is right","I won't reiterate everyone's comments but I must echo the praise; solid.
Lots of figures, an awesome dragon, great design, and all my pirate ships quake at the sight of this ship bearing down to ram opponents to the bottom.

The best part though is finding this on clearance.
$32.
That's over 50% off.
WalMart.  Go now.  Build your fleet or squadron.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"keexko","2009-06-21T05:56:47.53Z","Exceeds expectations","I didn't get this from Walmart or anything like most of the reviewers did nor did I get it full price! I got it from eBay!

Anyway onto the review. The reason I said it exceeds expectations is because the ship is very detailed for it's size. The only thing left that I could wish for is another troll armor for one of the six trolls! (yeah you heard it right, six trolls + a giant one!)

Pros and cons have already been stated in the other reviews. Only thing left for me to say is, this set is perfect for play and display!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Pileggiv15","2009-12-25T14:53:27.31Z","one of the best sets ever","This was one of the best sets i have ever built amazing detail. The cannon is very cool but the minifigs can't fit in the crows nest. The boats are fun to take off and play around. it is bad because it can not float but if you try to make it float it has holes to drain it out.not enough minifigs for slaves though",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"marko5000","2010-01-10T04:30:16.967Z","Cool ship..","I'm not really good at reviews so I'm gonna make a pros. and cons. list:

Pros: 
- 6 trolls
- dwarf and knight
- GIANT troll
- fun build
- the ballista type thing
- prison cell
- dragon
- plenty of space
- the length is perfect
- little ships on the side with crossbows
- 4 troll shields
- u can take off the sail in the back and store the swords there

Cons:
- there are 6 trolls and only 4 swords and shields (at least there are some crossbows)
- the knight doesn't have a sword
- no weapon for the dwarf
- no place for oars when u don't use them
- hard to put the dwarf in the net

Overall this set deserves a 4.5/5 I think, cause of it's playability and number of minifigs. 

Advice: get more knights or dwarfs and trolls if u get this set cause the trolls that come with this ship are supposed to be the crew and there aren't any warriors, knights or dwarfs cause there aren't enough good guys.
