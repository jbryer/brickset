It is also a much better way to get shadowtroopers instead of buying a tie crawler.  Here are some pros and cons

nice looking ship
great minifigs

"Jedd_the_Jedi","2008-01-13T02:32:31.81Z","Rings in the new year Imperial-style!","I was estatic to find the new battle packs in stores and quickly snapped both up. I opened this one first, and must say it does not disappoint. The Shadow Trooper looks excellent, and the stormtroopers come with improved helmet designs. Plus, you get the lovely molded guns. My first impression of the dropship was disappointment, but I have to say that once I put it together, it really doesn't look half bad! The dropship is not as flimsy as I expected, and the removeable platform makes for a fine play feature. All in all an excellent way to stock up on troops for your Imperial army.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Deinonychus","2008-01-04T23:44:01.95Z","Imperial Assault!","These recent smaller Star Wars sets have all revolved around a central premise; army building. So it was a pleasant surprise to find the new Imperial Dropship is actually a pretty decent vehicle in its own right.

In this set, three standard Stormtroopers make up the crew with a Shadow Stormtrooper acting as the pilot(Cross-training for Shadow Stormies?). The troopers are armed with two of the smaller carbine rifles and two of the longer rifles for hefty firepower. 

A totally LEGO manifested design for the Expanded Universe, the Dropship continues the LEGO TIE Starfighter coloring philosophy of gray, black, and blue. Building is what you'd expect from a set with 81 pieces (many spread out across the Minifigs).Three Imperial Insignia stickers add a little flash, and it's nice to have sticker placement over single bricks instead of over multiple parts that make teaing down and rebuilding difficult.

Once assembled, the Dropship is a joy. As far as LEGOs go, it has a very &quot;Classic Space&quot; vibe and wouldn't look too out of place among the Space Police or Ice Planet guys. It's not straight from the screen, and therefore an abomination to many Star Wars purists, but it's fun and actually acts as a DROP SHIP  because flipping the tail section up releases the rear seating platform and leaves it behind as the craft heads off to pick up another load of Imps. Overall construction is fairly sturdy.

There is a lot to love about this set, but there are also a few low points for me. Personally I'd have preferred an Imperial Pilot flying the thing, but I suppose this is a nice way for LEGO to provide other fans with easy and affordable access to a Shadow Trooper. The look of the ship is a bit clunky and there's really no good place for me to hold it without my hand engulfing the entire ship. Again, while I understand and appreciate the black and blue color-scheme, Imperial war machines should really be gray tones. The price is a little hight for 81 pieces...but I suppose that's mostly due to the Minifig count, which always pushes the cost up. (Still beats the price of individual Stormtroopers on Bricklink)

Overall, a good set. I can't think of a single reason not to buy at least one. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

though he broke it several times right away. so, a few simple additions and it's much better.  We put one of those upward sloping detail bits, I don't know the name, but they're from the classic space theme if I remember right, usually the front of a space ship or small car.  That and a plate across the bottom to firm up the wings and this thing is solid.  That added a little height, so we added another brick under the support for the troop platform.  then substituted a larger plate, and we can fit more troopers easily, as well as have them standing.

The place where the troopers sit can be detatched which was pretty pointless. There is no controls in cockpit and the window piece keeps faling off.

The minifigs are great, but it seems that the vehicles included in these packs are just an after-thought. The drop ship has way more pieces than the speeder pack - at the same price.
In any case, this set along with the Rebel scout speeder are the best among the 4 sets.

Pros: 

3 stormtroopers with upgraded mouthpieces (gray with black lines)
All-New shadow trooper- this is a nice little detailed figure that works great in anyones imperial army.
2 detailed long blasters and two detailed normal sized blasters- it's nice that they've  given all of the troopers their own blasters
two slots on the top of the dropship- 1 for each of the long blasters, or you can switch it around if you'd like.
the landing platform is a nice new feature, and it works pretty well. every once in a while you have to tip the vehicle to get the platform to come off, but it usually works fine. 
If you have other imperial recruits, there's an extra spot on the platform for them.
the cockpit is nice two because you don't have to pull a piece off to put a mini fig in or take him out. It's more life-like.
The set has wonderful playability so you won't get bored, and it goes hand in hand with the rebel battle pack.

He’s actually a stormtrooper with black armor which in my book makes him a shadow trooper (aka: elite stormtrooper).   I bought four of these sets so with the four stormtroopers that came with the imperial landing craft and the 12 with these four sets I had a sizable squad of 16 for my modifications to the landing craft (see my review there).  My four “shadow troopers” then were used to compise an elite shadow trooper commando team (and four seems like a reasonable number considering that during the Clone Wars a Republican Commando team was also made up of four elite clone troopers).  I then used the parts from the dropships of these four sets to make them some heavily armed and modified speeder bikes for use by my Shadow team in their elite secret missions in support of the Empire.

Pros:
+Price
+4 Mini-Figs including the Shadow Trooper

Cons:
+Hard to put weapons in the holder holes on top
+Cockpit always comes off
+Part the the Stormtroopers sit on always come undone

 I like this set a lot. It has some blue colors, which would look sooo much better in grey! (Have you compaired the old TIE fighter with the new TIE fighter yet??) The back part with the, uh, thruster-things, goes up so you can slide the platform off with the stormtroopers on it. The cockpit window moves so you can put in and take out the pilot. The stormtroopers have new helmets, which look really cool and movie-accurate! Anyways, on to the pros and cons!

Pros:
Stormtroopers
Shadowtrooper
The stormtroopers chest-pieces have print/pictures on both sides.
Rare cockpit window piece
Four blasters, two small, two large
Imperial logo stickers (I have no idea why everyone hates stickers! None of mine have fallen off!)

Cons:
Cockpit window part falls off easily when opening and closing it.
The platform the Stormtroopers sit on is really wobbly
There is a emty space on the platform, which is the ideal place for a fourth stormtrooper
The stormtroopers faces are black
There's this thing on the top of the cockpit piece thats like a hook or somthing a minifig can hold onto, but it's completely pointless.

Conclusion:
Buy like fifteen-THOUSAND of these things. The dropship could use a little improvment, but the Stormtroopers are worth it. You can also buy some of those clone wars clone battle packs and use their heads to rplace these stormtroopers black ones. You'll have your army in no time!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

And the vehicle could probably work as something of an addition to any Tatooine displays. Or Imperial Displays even.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Imperial Dropship is built with a combination of blue and black pieces with some grey thrown in for good measure. Stickers are used to deck out the airspeeder (I'd have to say it's more of an Airspeeder or part of a larger vessel since I doubt it would work outside of a planet's atmosphere.) with Imperial Emblems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three Stormtroopers and one Shadow Trooper are included with the set, I don't know why they decided to call him a Shadow Trooper as opposed to an Imperial Pilot, although I suspect it's because they used the Stormtrooper armor/helmet for him in black as opposed to the Imperial Pilot. Four blasters are included as accessories, two long and two short. Overall I'd have to say that as far as Battle Packs go it's a nice addition and good for troop building Imperials, but the vehicle is a tad on the odd side of things. But Star Wars is full of strange looking vehicle designs. I'd recommend you to get two or more of this set if you can, and as far as displaying it with larger vessels, the Imperial Landing Craft would make an excellent companion to this little vehicle.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

I decided to actively go for it and during my most recent trip to Spain I won an ebay auction getting this set for a pretty good price. For $9.99 RRP this is a really cool set. Its main function is definitely an army builder, but the drop ship is a pretty neat part of the set.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The dropship has a great Imperial feel to it. I have this sitting next to the Imperial Landing Craft 7659 and they compliment each other well. This set has cool playability, its swooshable and has a deployable platform to land stormtroopers in the heat of battle. Nicely done for an inexpensive set.</li><li>Pro 2: The minifigures are definitely a pro. 3 stormtroopers and a shadow trooper (basically a black painted stormtrooper). The later only appears in this set and the TIE Crawler. So you have an army builder and a rare minifigure for your collection.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Its hard to think of a con with this set, its well done for a good price. I guess if I had to be picky I'd say there could be a couple of clips on the side for the stormtrooper rifles (they sit on the top in open hole studs). But that is a very minor point.</li></ul>
<p>This really is a cool set, and a good army builder. I paid over RRP for a used one, which is normal for these types of sets, but I am definitely happy with my purchase.

The second I saw the new battle packs, I was intrigued by these sets, though most of my attention was caught by the Rebel Alliance Trooper battle pack. Still, I picked up this set and was very impressed.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is somewhat small, has the same Darth Vader banner at the top since 2005. The instructions had no mistakes, and were clear to read. The box, however, has a slight error, and uses the full black lined mouth helmets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set were mostly ramps and plates, though it did come with some technic pieces in the bunch. The parts could easily be used in a larger model is one desired.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Minifigures are what make a battle pack, and while this set didn&#39;t provide any new Minifigures, it had a very nice ratio of storm troopers. We get 3 regular, white storm troopers, 1 with a blaster pistol, and 2 with a blaster rifle. We also get a superb shadow trooper, and while it makes more since to have a pilot, the shadow trooper fits in nice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is a very fun 5 minute build. There is very limited use of the SNOT technique, and is mostly made out of ramps and a cockpit piece.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is great, and very reminiscent of a LAAT. The wings move up and sideways, and a little carrier piece is attachable for the storm troopers. It is somewhat nice to see Lego make their own vehicle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A nice set for only 10$, and really makes me wish Lego would stop trying to force battle packs to be 13$. The completed model is nice, the Minifigures are great, and is an overall good set. If you can find this set for under 25$, it is worth a buy.</p>
