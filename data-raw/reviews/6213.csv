It comes with four new rebal troops, three of witch sit crammed in the front with the last manning the cannon. I noted the extra stickers in confusion. I decided I'd using them later in a drawing of some sort. The blaster holders are a nice bonus, so you don't have guns ratteling around in the speeder as you drive. The cannon detaches and makes a nice turret. The cannon itself has a minpr flaw, the trooper who controls it is vulnerable to some shooting at him, which means others must rush to control before an imperial troop. The speeder is longer then I thought It would be. I you only have one person in it, it cuold be used for cargo. The helmets are too bulky. When I saw the LSW2 Game, they seemed a little large, but here they seem larger. The viser can't come down to protect their face either. In the game, though, It appeares to be painted on. But if so, why didn't they do that here?

* the picture of this set is misleading - you get 4 minifigs, not just the 2 pictured (tut tut Lego, way to undersell your own product!)<br />
* the set is possibly a bit overpriced for Australian buyers at AUD20, but hey I guess filling a set with minifigs costs more than filling it with 4x2 bricks.<br />

"AFOSL","2009-05-14T04:30:33.56Z","Not Found In The Movies But Looks Every Bit The Part","Simple design, minimal parts, quick to build, cheap to buy, great army builder.  These are the plus points for this little vehicle, produced purely to help Lego expand it's minifigure line up.
Since Hasbro own the rights to produce Star Wars figures, Lego had to make this craft in order to get their figures out there.
The craft itself is based on typical land speeder design - flatbed, repulsorlift driven, cargo or personel transport for shorter distances.
The build is simple, taking no more than ten minutes to assemble, and to keep the look authentic, the colour palette is a little drab - greys, black and tan.  A few white pieces brighten it up a little, but you won't find any block primary reds, blues or greens here.
The main splash of colour is introduced in the form of stickers.  This might be a bad thing for many.  The stickers are of the plastic kind, instead of paper, and these seem to be more hard wearing, if my memory serves me well.  I recall owning a small truck when I was much younger, and this had plastic stickers.  The stickers never peeled, didn't rot or crack, and never fell off in the ten years I had the vehicle.  Paper based stickers are prone to all of those negatives.
Hopefully the plastic stickers found in this set are as long lived as the plastic stickers found on sets from 25 years ago.
The stickers are very small and hard to place correctly.  The use of tweezers is advisable to help you acheive a perfect finish.
The minifigures are upto Lego's usual high standards and are a must for any Rebel army.  For the collector, these figures are the reason to purchase this set and it should not be overlooked.
Overall, a neat little set, if a little basic for some builders, and the use of (such small and fiddly) stickers lose this set a brick.  4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

LEGO did a great job making this set, with the removable turret tower on the back, and being able to carry 4 passengers.

<ul><li>Price is a bit high, but the minifigures make it worth it!</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this set now may go for a bit high, but it is worth it especially if you are trying to build a large Rebel army, as this is only 1 of 2 sets that comes with these figs. &nbsp;If you can get it for less than $25, go for it. &nbsp;If it is more, it isn't really worth it. &nbsp;Thanks for reading, and hope this helped!!</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,5

<p>Not much to say really, this pack is the only way to get (normal) rebel troopers at a cheap price, sadly they all look the same? This is a big con for me, couldn't we even have a sargeant?&nbsp;They come with two blaster rifles and two&nbsp;smaller&nbsp;blasters&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speeder</strong></p>
<p>Bad, for a start theres no seats! No controls either. The turret is nice, could take a nice chunk out of&nbsp;an AT ST. You can also take it out, though that makes the rest of the speeder look rather empty... When the turret is on and all the mini figs are in it looks very 'sleek' :)</p>

<p>In fact I believe&nbsp;that this set marks the first time we get to see the LEGO Rebel Trooper represented in Mini-Figure form.

<p>The Rebel Scout Speeder is an interesting vehicle as well, it could fit in with any Yavin IV display I'd wager and it has two seperate pieces, the speeder part which can seat two and the weapon tower that sits&nbsp;a third&nbsp;trooper and is detachable as a stationary defense unit. The stickers for details are minimal and don't get in the way as some stickers have a tendancy of doing, and the fact that you get four Rebel Scout Troopers and four blasters for them is great incentive to pick this set up.

<p>Por mi parte, lo compré en ebay junto a su gemelo por parte del imperio, 7667, por 15€ cada uno. Hacía tiempo que quería tenerlo pero los precios de los pocos que quedan en tiendas son muy altos.</p>
<h4>Caja/Instrucciones</h4>
<p>Desgraciadamente no venían en el lote, pero he podido seguir el montaje gracias a las instrucciones que hay en esta magnífica página. Fácil montaje y divertido.</p>
<h4>Partes</h4>
<p>El speeder tiene un buen diseño, pero a la hora de sentar a los cuatro minifiguras se hace complicado, por lo que hay que poner una es la torreta. </p>
<p>Para mi sorpresa la torreta se puede quitar y dejar separada del speeder como avanzadilla o apoyo a las tropas que acaban de desembarcar.</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Contiene cuatro minifiguras con buen diseño de vestuario con sus armas. Son Minifiguras dificil de encontrar y caras. El hecho de que tengan la misma cara o graduación no me parece un handicap para comprarlo. Te abre la imaginación para que los rediseñes.</p>

<h4>Construcción</h4>
<p>Fácil montaje y rápido. Divertido, ya que haces dos partes el speeder y la torreta.</p>
