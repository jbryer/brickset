"David1971","2008-06-01T18:20:41.513Z","Nice, but strangely overpriced","My reaction to this one is affected by the price. For &#163;14.95 it would seem just right, and a very nice set. &#163;12.95 would be even better. But for the actual price of &#163;19.95 (UK) there's not quite enough here.

If we consider another 2008 set, #7621, Indiana Jones and the Lost Tomb - also a Lucasfilm tie-in - it's quite a big thing made of 277 pieces, including two minifigs (plus a skeleton), and it costs &#163;18. Meanwhile this set is a not-very-big spaceship with just one minifig (plus R2D2), and costs &#163;20.

So Lego made a strange choice there. Leaving that aside, this is a nice ship to look at (especially from the back), and the new Anakin minifig is great. The 'ejector seat' for R2D2 isn't great -- at best you can make him plop out of the ship. But it's nice to have a 'hidden' moving-part function.

Basically it's a nice &#163;14 set, and then you are making an additional voluntary contribution of &#163;6 to Lego to support their good work in the community.

"Manxboi24","2008-06-21T17:50:47.03Z","Great set! ","Well, I got this set for my B-day so I'm finally getting around to reviewing it.

Overview:

This set is the first of the anticipated Clone Wars line as is a great one to start with.  It contains 153 pieces and costs $19.99 here in the US.

The Build:

The build takes roughly 20 minutes and is surprisingly different to that of the set 7143 Jedi Starfighter.  During this fun build, the only down side is having to attach all of stickers (such as one the tail and the yellow SNOT at the front.

Minifigs:

This set comes with 2 minifigs - R2-D2 and Anakin Skywalker.  There's nothing new about R2, just the same cute but standard droid as seen in many other sets.  The Anakin minifig is in cartoon form which looks slightly weird but you get used to it.  

Fighter:

The fighter itself is very cool and looks really good.  Under where R2 is placed, there is a little lever with you and push and the poor droid is pushed out of the fighter (providing you apply the right amount of pressure).  Under the wings, LEGO has once again managed to include the flick fire missiles.  This variety is, however, different to those we saw last year and are better at staying in place.  Although you'd except them to be the same size, this fighter is smaller than the version that we saw in 03 but not by much.  Overall, the fighter is pretty good and has some interesting features.

Summary:

I'd recommend anyone who's a fan of PT to get this set as it is loaded with cool features.  Very swooshable!  4.5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-01T21:00:31.17Z","Cool Starfighter","This set is one of the Star Wars sets and is from this year, part of the Clone Wars subtheme. The set is good in the design, building and too in th pieces. The two minifigures included are the R2-D2 minifigure, that is good with the correct shape of the R2 and also good with the details and pieces. The Anakin minifigure in this set is customized to looks like the Anakin of the Clone Wars, and the details of the body are good like the original lightsaber. The anakin's head is nice detailed, but the eyes are not in a good style, makes it looks like more exo force and the scars aren't in a good size. Another thing that this minifigure have that can be better is the hair, due to the shape and color, this brown is not the best for it, altough the anakin of the Clone Wars have this color of the hair. The Jedi Starfighter features some characteristics of the Star Wars sets of space ships, like the missiles, in good style and color but with bad building, don't works very well, altough the position is right. Another characteristic of the current star wars spaceships sets is the landing gears, that like the other works very well. The base of the starfighter is good builted and it have some characteristics of the building of the Obi Wan's delta 7 starfighter set, released in 2002 as one of the episode 2 sets, the Jedi Starfighter. The wings (not exactly wings), have some limitations to the movements, but it works well due to the spaceship still in a better style. The cockpit is simple and the figure stays in it also very well. The minifigure of R2 stays in this Jedi starfighter too and it is good positioned. On the back, some pieces are used to looks like turbos, and these are good like the &quot;flag&quot; piece, that have a part hidden, to it looks like exactly the aerodinamic back of the delta 7 style Jedi starfighter. The front is very simple and made with few plates and few stickers. Altough the set is good builted, the front is so much simple in comparison with other starfighters and this starfighter is more small due to it. Overall a good set,  useful pieces, but the minifigure style can be better and too for the front building, like the sides, so much simple to a set with this size, including few plates and making a boring building, but still cool to play with.

"MandalorianCandidate","2008-11-20T19:54:33.06Z","This little set has swooshability","Anakin's Jedi Starfighter is the preview set for the Clone Wars Lego line, as was the original 7143 Jedi Starfighter (2002) for the AOTC Lego line.  Having seen first hand much of the CW sets released in August, I'd say Lego set the bar high with this edition then failed to clear it.

I'll start off by saying that I really dig this starfighter.  Just a nice addition to the Lego SW collection.  The design of the set is lifted closely from 7143 but there are many improvements.  First off we get two minifigs instead of the one (Pilot Obi-Wan) and the R5-D4 droid dome.  This is because of the droid socket that was designed into the CW ship, which holds the included R2-D2.  Although most older collectors probably have plenty of R2s, the younger crowd may not have him yet.  I suppose this isn't Lego's fault (the droid dome vs. full on droid) as the ship from AOTC was designed to have a fully integrated droid (although the EP3 JSF did have the droid dome and the movie version has the pop-out droid socket).  Still, for a $20 set there should be at least two minifigs.  

I like that Lego/Lucasfilm kept the Anakin ship color consistent between EP1, EP3, and now the CW toons (it was blue and white in the original CW).  That being said, the yellow color plays off nicely with the dark blay (bluish gray) of the wings.  It also adds to some easy modding as it shouldn't be that hard to find replacement parts in other color schemes for other Jedi Knights (I was able to scrounge up some dark red pieces from bricklink for an OB1 fighter and some dark blue pieces for another Jedi).

The pop-out socket is kind of neat but it doesn't quite get R2 out of the socket, but I score Lego high for the effort.  The two flick fire missiles are an improvement over 7143, which had none.  I also like that the front of the ship is fully integrated into the structure unlike the 7143, which was a clip on.  Besides the stickers (five of them, grrrrr), my only real complaint is that the rudder/flag element is attached to the fuselage by one clip brick instead of in two places on the 7143, making it less stable. At least the stickers are see-through, allowing modders to put them on differently colored pieces and letting just the foreground be seen.  Oh yeah, the creepy minifig face.  Don't dig it at all.  I like the different hair piece but the CW-style face has gotta go.  I'm hoping they won't carry over to non-CW minifigs.

There are some interesting parts, like the 4x4 circular plate, the rare 1x12 plates, and all the wing tiles.



One last note.  I'm surprised that the JSF has a lower rating that the Magnaguard ship and the V-19.  I'm thinking that many are equating quality with price, which is never an automatic correlation.  The rest of the CW sets to me are either OK or are kind of a waste of money (**cough**twilight**cough).  With this set I thought we'd be getting some nice stuff at a reasonable price.  I suppose whether we did or not is up to debate, but I think Lego did a nice job at getting the hype up by delivering well with this first CW entry.

Pros:
New Anakin mini fig- really cool, comes with blue lightsaber with gray hilt.
R2-D2
Cockpit- has contols and a spot for Anakin, window piece must be pulled off to get inside. Not enough space for lightsaber(I added a piece to the underside of the cockpit to hold it).
Slot for R2 to sit in while in flight. Unfortunately, when the ship turns past 90 degrees, R2 slips out, but I customized it, and now R2 stays in place.
2 flick fire missles- stay in place well, I'm not usually a fan, but these ones are kind of cool.

"DevDevBeck","2009-06-06T16:35:40.81Z","This is one of the Worst lego sets ever!","This is a Anikan's Jedi starfighter from the Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series. The ship has flick fire missiles, an R2-D2 launch feature, and a detailed underside.

The Minifigures:
R2 D2 is a good and rare addition to the set. A good R2 figure is hard to fiind now.
The Anikan Minifigure is a DISGRACE. Why did lego change the mini figures? The Anakin figure from the 2006 sets was much better. And where did he get the scars that are on his face? I mean, I haven't seen the TV series, but I guess Lego just wanted to make him look more dramatic, but if you ask me, they FAILED.

The Ship:
Anakin's Jedi starfighter itself has a good overall design, but it lacks in quality. The R2 launch feature doesn't work, and you practically need to slam your fist to get it to work anyway. When it does work, it launches him very high into the air and he will never land on his legs. Plus, the hollow space in the middle of the fighter where the launch mechanism is causes the middle section to collapse on it. On the bottom, there are some flick fire missles, but you can't flck them becuase there are too many parts in the way! Why did they switch to flick fire missiles anyway? I think that was a dumb move.

All in all, this set is terrible. Don't het it unless you want some of the pieces. I made the mistake of choosing this over a Star Wars video game, which I now regret.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"legoreviewer","2009-06-16T11:54:41.34Z","Suprisingly Awsome!","When I first saw this set, I was thinking it looked kinda lame. But I saw it on the store shelf and there were no other good sets out at the time so I went ahead and bought it along with Ahsoka's Jedi Starfighter. I was very im pressed with the design and overall look of the set. I mainly got it for R2-D2 and anakin but as it turned out the set was really good.

Minifigs: R2-D2 I didn't have so I got this set for him and Anakin both as an addition to my Republic army. So the minifigs are greatbut Anakin looks pretty scary eith his scars. Ugh..

Build: Simple and easy. Took me about 25 min. to finish. This set would be nice for beginners due to the fun and easy build.

Finished Product: Looks pretty cool and the landing gear works very well. But the R2-D2 launching function is suckish unless you pretty much slam the set.

Overall: A great set and the launching function is the only problem but it's no big deal. Very nice set. Get it before it sells out!! 5/5

"TheDarkKnight","2010-04-09T01:11:15.903Z","A Set That Takes You To ""a galaxy far, far away...""","<p>Introduction: Well, this is a pretty nice set. Not the best in the world, but worth the $25 price tag, I'd say. There's a really nice piece selection, and, while not being the best, it gives a few nice yellow pieces and yields a small amount of useful technic pieces. Also, I haven't seen the trans-blue cones in a while, so that was nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Packaging: What better place to start than what you first see, in fact, the only thing you see until the boc is opened. The box is pretty nice, but is comes complete with those new flaps that are ruining the LEGO Company's boxes. The box art is nice, and despite what others are saying, the new Clone Wars figures may differentiate from ""normal"" Star Wars minifigures, but however ""ugly"" they may be, they do resemble the new cartoon characters a lot and I respect that the LEGO Company is keeping up its standards in that respect. The ""old"" R2-D2 is included here in this set, as this was released in 2007 as a ""trial"" Clone Wars set along with <em>Hailfire and Spider Droid.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigures: Only two in this set, but they're suitable. Who else? The title, of course, is <em>Anakin's Starfighter</em>, so it does make sense to include the title character. And, by the way, I don't care what anyone else says, Anakin and Padme will never be as close and Anakin and Artoo. Never. R2-D2 is his same old self, and by old, I mean the previous version with the white head with the silver stripe&nbsp;around the head and the detailing that looks vaguely like the movie. He has a nice design, as he has since his first outing in 2000, but I do sincerely wish that he were a little shorter. He really stacks up against normal minifigs, but that's pretty much unpreventable given that his conception came around the same time as the first AT-ST. That one that looked like... I don't know. Anakin... This is where the set, all sets with ""Clone Wars"" Anakin drop the ball: His face and hair are perfect, spot-on, beautiful. Then... the body. The torso is just.... weird. The actual Clone Wars Anakin has a sort of dark blue torso and crimson arms. Why LEGO felt the need to change this to black and brown, I don't know. But, while not fitting as a piece of <em>Clone Wars</em> merchandise, it is a perfectly acceptable LEGO minifigure. The detailing on the torso is pretty nice. Not very accurate, but nice. Overall, I'd give the minifigures a solid 4.5 out of 5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Vehichle: Wow. After my rambling about the minifigs, that's about all I can say. This thing tops the original (Episode II) so much, starting with the glorious fact that <em>the wings bend!</em> Yup, you got it: <em>The wings bend.</em> Man, I was so happy to know that it's not even funny. Love it. I don't really care for the way the back was designed, but other than that, it's nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Build: Very nice. Sturdy, holds together even after a drop on carpet. I didn't actually test it on purpose, but, y'know, things happen. I really, really, really (no matter what anyone else says) loved the Artoo popping-mechanism. It's just awesome and very creative. Fortunately, if built right, it works <em>almost</em> every time; but if it doesn't, that's not a reason to come on here and complain. Maybe gripe, but some reviews are just <em>pitiful.</em> I'm sorry, I just can't abide it. Anyways, enough of my self-indulgent rambling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall: A very nice set with a minifigure selection that's pretty nice. Good job, LEGO, I'm lovin' it! (much more than McDonald's. *shudder*)</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"penguin999","2010-01-23T21:09:59.17Z","a jedi can fly too"," This set is a great set for any jedi or clone wars fan. the minifigs are great as well. You get a clone wars Anakin with a new and double torso plus new hair and a lightsaber. Also includes R2-D2 which can fit in front of the cockpit to help Anakin navigate or pilot. Also you can push a button on the back to make R2 jump in the air but this does not work at all. The cockpit is not that big and hardly has room for his elbows but it does have a detailed control panel. It has nice engines and flap on the end. There is also missles under the wings and directly above are the laser cannons. look at the pitcher above and see the light grey piece attached to the missle....it looks stupid right? so I just moved it further back so it is hidden. And lastly one of the best parts of the set is the landing gear. It has 3 landing feet which fold in and out of really good.

"bricksaber","2018-01-02T14:46:23.077Z","Happy 10th Anniversary Clone Wars!","<p>This year marks the 10th anniversary of Star Wars The Clone Wars and as both a member of the show&#39;s crew and a big AFOL I wanted to highlight a couple sets to mark the occasion.</p>

<p>First a little background on me. I worked on the entire run of CW starting as the coordinator&nbsp;of the design department and ending as the script and continuity assistant production manager (I like to think of it as a long title for &#39;big nerd&#39;). It had been a life long dream to work on Star Wars and I did pretty much everything there, I know I am lucky. During that time I was always playing around with my Lego so no one was more excited than me to see the first official piece of merchandise was a Lego set of Anakin&#39;s Jedi Starfighter.</p>

<h2>Box Design</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t know if this set was the first but I know there can&#39;t be many sets that have 2 completely different box designs. Though the red Vader version was technically first, I prefer the Clone Wars branded blue and white box.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>This is the most disappointing aspect of the set for me and for many others I am sure. It wasn&#39;t the number of minfigs or who&nbsp;were included but how they were designed. I have no idea why it was decided to change the basic look of the minifig faces in the Clone Wars sets but it was a terrible. Instantly, Clone Wars became separate from the rest of Star Wars which was a huge mistake the line could never shake. A fact this AFOL&nbsp;took particularly hard since I also happened to work on the only other show where the minifig faces were&nbsp;altered (Avatar). I am glad the&nbsp;latest Clone Wars sets have since corrected this.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>Though the build was fairly simple, I enjoyed it. The set did a good job capturing the look of Anakin&#39;s&nbsp;ship with few stickers and the fun R2 socket play feature.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>This wasn&#39;t the best Clone Wars set but it was a good one, especially as the first one ever. It was a dream come true to be a part of the Star Wars mythos and I am very proud that people still enjoy the show today. And if the rumors are true, I can&#39;t wait to see how&nbsp;Lego does&nbsp;a new version of Anakin&#39;s Jedi Starfighter.</p>

<p>I will be doing another Clone Wars review soon, for my favorite set and will talk a little more how the subject matter came about. Stay tuned!</p>
