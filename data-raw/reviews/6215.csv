                         The hailfire droid
the hailfire droid is realy cool. it is smaller than the first by alot. the new missles go really far. the wheels are a pain to make but work great.    I rate the hailfire droid a 4.2 of 5

                         The spider droid
the spider droid is ok i guess . i think they should have left it out and lowered the price.  I rate it a 2 of 5

                         The Droids
i guess i would call it a army builder or a super battle pack. i like the old commander droid better. 4.8 of 5

                          Overall

But what I didn't know is that the hailfire droid was freakishly small! It was funny 'cause someone I know saw it and asked me, &quot;Hay, where did you get that one set, you know that MINI hailfire droid?&quot; I laughed! 

Anyways, I think that the prievious spider droid was better designed(the leggs mainly) but I like the brown. The minifigs are great!

excellent army builder

cons 
hailfire droid is too small. When I compared the size of my hailfire to my turbo tank I was dissappointed in how primative it compared to the turbo tank. I agree that the technic hailfire droid looks a lot better compared to this hailfire. Still it does look good. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Manxboi24","2008-05-24T18:06:04.95Z","Nice Little Set","OK, I got this set a few weeks ago and I'm finally getting around to reviewing it.  If you don't already know, this set contains two battle droids, one droid commander, a super battle droid, a spider droid, and last but not least, a hailfire droid.  

Pieces:

This set contains 249 pieces, eighty of which are treads.  It does include some very nice tan and brown bits, as well as the new variation of flick fire missile, one of those space bubbles, the clear dishes, used to hold the chains, and some exoforce-looking parts on the spider droid.  In other words, loads of great pieces to make MOCs with!

The Build:

The build is fairly simple with the minifigs, then the hailfire, and then the spider droid being built.  The only tedious parts in this build are putting the chains together and building the legs to the spider droid.  Other than that, it's smooth sailing!

Minifigs:

OK, mostly, the minifigs are nothing special.  The two regular battle droids are exactly the same as those found in the newest MTT and the super battle droid is the same one that is in the droids battlepack.  However, the droid commander is a new variation of battle droids, getting its full torso in yellow as opposed to the ones in earlier models.  

Spider Droid:

I actually like the spider droid more than the one in the Wookiee Attack set.  It is the right colour and it has a much better size and shape compared to the blue one.   The only problem with it is that the legs are extremely annoying to have to align.  Although they are a lot better in mobility as compared to the old spider droid, they are extremely hard to keep in the same position and can be annoying to move.

Hailfire Droid:

This is, without a shadow of a doubt, the centrepiece of the set.  The wheels, made up of little treads on top of a clear disk, run smoothly and look pretty cool.  The missiles are cool, even though there is only eight.  It's better that they stay in place and are still flick fire.  However, it's strange that the small front gun is added.  As it is kinda easy to mod on, I find it strange how TLC didn't include it.  

Overall:

This set is one of the nicest for the first half of the year and is definitely a larger army builder type set.  It is also worth the $20 it costs.  Overall, I'd say 9/10!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It comes with a huge tank which I think is called the hailfire droid. The treads are able to sviwel and the flick-missiles are also able to move. You get 8 flick-missiles in total which is very cool for a LEGO set. This set also comes with 2 regular battle droids, a commander droid with the yellow battle droid torso and the dark gray super battle droid.<br><br>The other vehicle which comes with this set is called the spider droid. This small droid has two legs on each side and on the front is a movable turret. The eyes can sviwel too and this vehicle also has a brown ball piece which has an antenna on the top. I really can't complain about this set and you also won't have to worry about stickers.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

Opened the boxed and slid down the lego pieces in plastic and hmmmmm, not to much bricks. Knowing how lego is, sometimes you would thing that there is not much brick but you will be amazed how it turned out in the end, so I kept my good hopes going. It was an easy build, but I was not happy with the result. In fairness the Hailfire Droid looks cool, but rather too small for my taste, same goes for the spider droid. This set is definitely a must if you want to recreate the clone war battle, other than that it's a one time buy for me.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"DarthSteve","2009-11-23T20:41:36.217Z","Another Great Set","Firstly, I am rating this set as a 5 out of 5, but I have to say that I think the LEGO Makers should have put a little more thought into this one, namely the Spider Droid. Don't get me wrong, I love the Spider Droid - there's absolutely nothing wrong with it; it's really cute actually, and I love it! I'm merely suggesting that they could have made it larger with a little more solidity given to it, like the Hailfire Droid.

In my personal opinion, the two droids should have been equal in size and that's all there is to it. My main issue here is the Spider Droid's legs. If it was even slightly larger, maybe some mechanics could have been incorporated into it and some sturdier pairs of legs could have been attached (similar to the legs on the Separatist Shuttle or the Clone Walker, for example).

On to the Pros of this set; and trust me, there are plenty of reasons to love this set! One of those reasons is the price, sold at about $30.00 Canadian.

The slew of minifigs included in this set is fantastic. Not only do you get two more regular Battle Droids for your Trade Federation Army, but you also get a Battle Droid Commander (distinguishable by its yellow body) and a Super Battle Droid, which are usually only included in the larger, more expensive sets, like the Armored Assault Tank. However, please note here that the Super Battle Droid included in this set has two regular arms - no Blaster Arm like the ones in the AAT set have.

Moving on to the parts of the set itself, I consider this a great value because you sort of get a two-part set. We have the Spider Droid that I already mentioned, plus the Hailfire Droid, which is very impressive, in my opinion anyway. The two glass wheels are surrounded by brown interlocking tread pieces, creating a very cool and unique design for the wheels on the droid. It also comes with eight flick missiles for heavy fire. The Hailfire Droid can fold up and fold out for both combat and non-combat stances.

In summary: If you love LEGO STAR WARS, buy this set!

Pros:
Minifigs: Battle Droid (x2), Battle Droid Commander, Super Battle Droid
Two-part Set: Hailfire Droid, Spider Droid
Price

Cons:
Overall Size of Spider Droid/Spider Droid's Legs",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Building experience: Its Fun, But Too Much Reiteration. What is not So Fun. And The Wheels are Slow and Strenuouns. But it don´t taint this set.

Parts: The parts are good, Brown is Good Color. And Shape of Parts is good too. And very much Extra parts.

Playability: Is good, is you have Clones Already. Play in it is Trikcy without they. Else Playability is Good, Al parts move good.

Value for money: This is a Little expensive set, but price what i bought it is an very inexpensive. 

Briefly:

Pros:
-Color of Parts.
-Shape of parts.
-Spider droid is Cute.
-Halfire droid is Cool.
-Cool Minifigs.
-Much Extra Parts.

Cons
-Prise In Finland.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, let us review the set. I'm not sure what others have said already about this set so let's start with a few interesting observations. This set features a new straight armed Battle Droid design, which allows the Battle Droids to hold the blaster pieces given to them the correct orientation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dwarf Spider Droid in this set is built fairly simply, but it is a bit on the loose side as far as the lower legs are concerned. The connection piece slides in snuggly, but it doesn't click, so the lower legs are always flopping around and around in circles when you try to pose it properly. Not to say though that they are going to move around all of the time, it seems to depend on some factor that I haven't quite nailed down yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hailfire Droid is a clever design. Although much smaller than the original Technic design (which I don't yet own) it still looks impressive in any display. And the build involves some nice steps and equally interesting pieces. (This was my first experience with the little interconnecting LEGO chain-links.) There are also flick-fire missiles, eight of them, and they work quite well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>True you only get four mini-figures with this set, but in a way the Hailfire and Dwarf Spider Droids are like Maxi-Figures for your LEGO display since they represent varied tools of the Droid Army. Overall I really liked this set, the new Super Battle Droid coloring looks metallic and passably shiney and more Droids for your army can never be bad. I liked it so much I bought two of them and would probably have picked up more later on down the road if I could afford it.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
