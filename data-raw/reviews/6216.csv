My only problem, is that it comes with shock troops. Like the battle pack, they shouldn't have shock troops on Kashyyk. They are created later, and go to Mustafar, the lava planet. But, except for that, It looks like a very good set. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cys07gz","2007-12-21T09:33:31.263Z","Many moving parts...but one too many...","Yeap, just got it for HK$470 from a parallel import shop, that is, about US$60, US$20 more than Shop@Lego and US$12 more than the cheapest in BrickLink. This price-hike kept me wondering why Lego refuses to take orders from Hong Kong - it only helps the speculators.

OK, back to the set. The AT-TP is very very sturdy with the 2-3 legs - the 3rd can only touch the ground when the body is slightly inclined forward - I think this is the resting, or parking, position.  This 3rd leg in my set doesn't drop down easily.  In fact it sometimes take with it the white anchor piece from the ceiling when I tried to put it down.

All 6 pieces of armour that made up the body can be opened, and all 3 legs are adjustable.  So many movable parts make this set very playable.

If you stretch the 2 main legs, the body can point almost 130 degrees upward and still standing.  This angle allows the adjustable main and upper guns to point about 160 degrees.  If you hang a Snowspeeder or other Rebel aerial vehicles above the AT-TP, it makes a very nice anti-aircraft battery. 

The main problem comes from the &quot;top gun&quot; - the loose swirling base peice makes it swing like mad whenever you move the set and if the gunner's seat is not rested in the 2 catches. This position will make the main and top guns pointing rather upward.

I agree that the cabin is boring, and there are no hatches for the drivers to look forward.  All they can do is to look downward from the floor-less cabin.

Standing with the AT-AT in UCS, mini-fig and mini sizes, and the Scout Walker, they together look a very formidable AT-vehicles.

If not for a point deducted from the swiling top-gun and boring and hatchless cabin, it could have been a 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Manxboi24","2008-01-18T10:07:06.95Z","Brilliant Set","First of, this set is brilliant. I love it!  It has a considerable likeness to the actual craft in the film. The bulky shape really suits it well.  Anyway, on to the review:

The Minifigs

This set comes with two shocktrooper clones, which have white hips, a new feature on clones.  Although I don't think that 2 is a good number for minifigs in this set, 4 minifigs would have been better.  Also, why shockies?  Clone scout troopers would have been better but I'm not complaining, I like shockies. 

The Set

The set uses some interesting building techniques that give it its bulky shape.  The legs are reinforced which helps the back legs support the walker.  The third leg folds up and attaches to a brick hanging under the cockpit.  The interior of the walker is nice and simple with a space for one clone to operate the walker and another space for another clone.  You can open up the side hatches to look inside the vehicle as well as lifting the roof off.  The cannon is cool.  The main cannon moves up and down.  The clone-operated cannon is on top of this cannon and moves side to side as well as up and down.  

Overall

This set is brilliant for those Prequel Trilogy fans, especially those wanting to recreate the Battle of Kashyyyk.  I can see the prices for this set rising in two or three years so I'd recommend getting it now.

"Moscadini","2008-01-18T21:20:38.343Z","New type of Legs?","I just bought this set last week.

As some of the people that put a review on this set...they say it &quot;wobbles&quot; because the 2 main legs are not all that great; and so they have to put the &quot;3rd&quot; leg to hold it up.  Well...if you put the 2 main legs right, you will not have the issue.  I put it on a &quot;wobbly&quot; surface (aka my bed) and I didn't have the problem for it to fall forward.

Pros:

- 2 Shock Troopers
- 2 New rifles
- 3rd leg
- Cool design

Cons:
- Legs cannot move at the &quot;ankle&quot;
- The button &quot;area&quot; could have been easily 'fixed' with gray plates
- Could have come with 3 mini-figs for the price since that is what it comes with in the movies

I think that this set is not worth your money, i mean its good but not that good for $40! Who came up with this idea? It is true to the movie and is a must have for all SW lego collectors. It also comes with 2 shock troopers, but however they are modified a little bit to the battle packs. Look at your battle pack shock trooper. Under the belt where they keep the ammo, grenades, etc. is the black stuff, right? but in this set, they replace it with white! whats up with that!? now my shock trooper army consists of 8 (i know pretty small) and 2 of them have the white belts! so i need to down grade it to a 3! Nice try to please me lego! The 3rd leg doesn't snap down. you need to unattach it, put it down, its a lot of work. The big heavy laser cannon and the top gunner looks cool, but i'm going to have to stick with a 4! Heres a descrption from starwars.com about this attack pod:


As the Clone Wars escalated, the Republic military built up their ground forces with newer, more versatile models of walking battlefield armor. This two-legged model, dubbed the pod attack walker, featured artillery cannons and a third retractable leg used for stability during long-range weapons firing. Clone trooper drivers piloted this walker model in such heated campaigns as those found on Kashyyyk and Felucia.

Well, its true to the movie! the instruction booklet looks and is extremely well created, so it was easy to build. And if you have this set and are build ing it now or in the future, take your time building this, if you do 1 wrong mistake, it WILL mess up your set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Also, this set comes with two cool minifigures: two shocktroopers. I am really glad that lego was able to see this in the backround of the movie.

this thing is magic in the form of plastic

ever since i saw this thing here on brickset i want it more than anything else and when i saw it at wal-mart for the amazing price of $24.99 i almost screamed &quot;holy cow!&quot; right in the middle of a group of people!

it barely ever falls over even on 2 legs and the 3rd leg is just awsome. the minifigs are great even though they should have put scout troopers but shockies are still awsome. the cockpit inside is wasome and full of space. it comes with 2 rifles for 2 troopers so they can easily defend themselves and they have a special clips to attatch them to.the hatches on the  outside make it pore realistic because if your trying to make a stop motion video for youtube or somthing you want it to look life like and a gigantic gun isnt going to throw itself upside-down for people to get inside.

now ill go to the pros and cons

pros
~very stable
~guns are very big and and playable
~third leg is awsome
~hatches on sides make it more realistic
~the tallest republic walker yet(i think)
~very roomy cockpit
~place to store weapons

Yes, you can see the clone troopers piloting the walker, but that doesn't bother me. I like how the legs are sturdy and the third leg is really neat to have.This walker is just another reason why the clone army is so tough! It would have been nicer if the set came with one more shock trooper, but since I have a lot of shock troopers from the battle packs that is not a big problem.Overall this set is great and the price is a little high, but I guess it is worth it if your a star wars lego fan like me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The legs are very sturdy and it is very easy to keep standing when on display even on just two of the legs. It has great guns and a good interior. It is a very satisfying build. One of the bad things about this set is that there are a few gaps in between bricks on the top of the pod and the shock troopers legs are completely white instead of white with a black waist as in the past. However, aside from these minor flaws, this is a great set the guns stay in place when in use and the side hatches don't fly open of their own accord.

I really like the design of the cockpit/(head) it's sleek and looks like the armor designs of the AT-TE and such. The construction is solid, and the third leg for stabilazation is a nice touch. The only downside I saw to this set was the price. It's comparable to the redesign of the At-St (only about 100 more pieces) but a price difference of $20?

The tank looks great with the Turbo Tank which will really intimidate your CIS foes!The set came with 2 shocktroopers (which by the way are sweet!) The interior design for the cockpit I liked cause it showed TLC is willing to try different designs. I like the open cockpit to the ground! The legs to this walking piece of destruction can go up to 90 degrees making this an awesome anti-aircraft vehicle. And I don't see why people don't get what the 3rd leg is for? It's for the AT-AP to rest in a stable position. Acting as a unmoveable command post. I have 2 clone packs and made it into fence for the clones like on Kashyynk. Sorry if I mispellings. Anyways so I have the small wall and I have the AT-AP behind the reinforced wall. It looks very pleasing and it keeps your clones some heay artillery cover if they're going to charge and AT-AP just follows suit.

Cons:
-The legs can't bend.

-The passenger seat is kinda weird (There should have been controls there).
-Only two figs for $40. Another Shocktrooper and maybe a droid or Jedi would have been nice (Maybe Aayla Secura?)
-Not a big problem, but why Shocktroopers? Their primary funciton is law enforcement and security. 327th Star Corps troopers would have been nice. This isn't a big complaint though. I do like Shocktroopers.

Pieces: Two MEASLY clones. Nice blaster rifles, though. Ugh.

Playability: Legs move fully. Unstable side-wing thingies. The turret is nice and has great range (Up and down and side-to-side) but beyond that, nothing. For diorama battlefields, it poses great, and cross sections nicely for display.

Compatibility: If you can find a lot of other ground based vehicles for both sides, sure. I enjoy having the Droid Gunship hover around it, making good use of the swiveling turret.

Since it wasn't part of the Clone Wars line, I never gave it a chance. Although I did see it flashed in one episode, I didn't even consider it. Now, my Republic ground forces are slim and I don't want 2 AT-TEs, so I bought this set. I was shocked at how the designeers built such a great design out of simple bricks. The set is tall, but overall, not big. The turret has a lock feature so it doesn't swivvle constantly. The third leg really makes no sense. When I play, I usually convert the third leg into a holder to make the walker look like a portable turret. The control room inside is well detailed. The navigator seat is kinda pointless though. It has two clips to hold accessories, but serves no other purpose. It coulda used a control panel or some kind of button. 

Pros:
TALL
Works excellent with the Clone Wars collection
3 turrets
Figs
Nice detail

This thing makes an ace toy and an even better dislay model. Its fairly movie accurate and it the large two leg/tri leg waker to date. The third leg is neatly tucked away and comes, presumably when you needt use the bi cannon as a sort of artilary piece.

The figures for me are the only disapointment. The Red Elite clones dont quite fit, seemingly as you would have pilot versions. Still they look good when placed on the gun or inside the cockpit.

The interior is an interesting design with lots hinged plates using many technic pieces to assist in the design. It works out well I think especially for the legs.

The biggest flaw of this set is the price. I got this new for £40 which for the size and piece ratio is highly extortionate, especially for anticapted set like this was.

So:

Pros:
-Nice colour scheme.
-Movie accurate
-Nice 'fine' details such as rear vents and grill pieces.
-Interior isnt too bad.
-More clones for the collection
-Box isnt too oversized for once.

Cons:
-Way over priced
-Clones are bog standard
-Some gaps in the paneling.

"Legodarthclone","2012-10-10T22:15:48.11Z","Pretty Good","When I first saw this set on eBay, I had to have it. I eventually got a used one for 50 bucks. I have to say, when it came in the mail, the build was awesome, it turned out perfect, it looks amazing, And the shock troops are great! My only complaint is the round peices on the legs fall off really easy, and the legs cant really move, but I use it more as a display thing.",FALSE,4,4,4,3,5
"psychman7","2013-08-31T20:12:39.143Z","Star Wars Set #14: 7671 AT-AP Walker","This is one of those walkers that didn't get a huge amount of screen time, but it's still a very nice walker. It's also, in my opinion, the most interesting out of all of them.<div><br></div><div><b>Box/Instructions:</b></div><div>It's about as big as you would expect for a forty-dollar set. It's also in the environment of which you see it. On Kashyyyk, possibly shooting down Wookiee soldiers. It really looks intimidating just looking at the box. The instructions are, like always, easy to follow.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Pieces:</b></div><div>A lot of these pieces are what you can expect for a set like this, but that doesn't mean they are bad ones. There are even a couple printed pieces, like for the open circle tile and the control panel. I like the idea of using the trapdoor pieces, that's a clever use in case the minifigures need to escape to the outside.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigures:</b></div><div>The two minifigures given here are pretty much identical to each other. They are both clone shock troopers, with lovely red decalling (is that even a word?). Their helmets are really awesome. The one thing I don't like is they have an all-white leg piece. The waist should be black, like all clones have.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The AT-AP:</b></div><div>Like I said, this is the most interesting-looking walker out of all of them. Starting with the middle, you get a gapped but spacious command center that can hold two minifigures: one holds the driver, who controls the vehicle, and the other is in the passenger seat looking after the rifles. The next thing constructed are the legs, and I like the way these are built. The one thing I would change about them is to actually make them movable. Of course, they can move backward and forward, but the knee joints could use the same pieces used to make the leg move backward. Then you get to the retractable third leg, which, in my opinion, is a nice, proper way to build a movable leg. It can fold up and attach itself to a white plate at the back of the vehicle. It holds well, but I think it looks better when folded down. After the legs, the panels are built. The trapdoor pieces work well for the vehicle, in case a shock trooper needs to climb out and shoot enemy droids or Wookiees from the side. But if you don't want them to escape from the side, you can open the back or top for them to climb out of. On the top panel are two cannons. The large one looks absolutely fantastic, It's not one I would mess with. The other cannon can swivel if the large cannon is elevated properly, and it can also pivot up and down to fire at air or ground targets. The other weapon is at the front of the vehicle, using the cool technic stick with a cone.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Final Verdict:</b></div><div>Pieces - 10/10 - Decent choices, especially those trapdoors.</div><div>Minifigures - 6/10 - Cool troopers, but flawed and could include more. Maybe another clone for a gunner?</div><div>AT-AP - 10/10 - It's stunning.</div><div><br></div><div>Final result - 8.67/10. It's a lovely set, and it's a cool vehicle overall.</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
