the rogue shadow is so cool. on the left side it has a gun that you pull a lever it comes out and the trigger hits the ship and shoots. on the right side in the front there is a compartment for two of the new snipers. on the right in the back are some weird red grey and tan missles that dont really fire. the cockpit is roomy compared to others. this set has alot of secrets compartments and doors. it also has some cool landing gear on the bottom.

The ship on the box looks kind of cool but, it just didn't grab my attention.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting it to be as fun as it was to build.  This set is very, very cool.  

Pro's:
Very cool design.  Images don't do it justice because there is a lot of detail just doesn't come out.  Every contour and compartment was well thought out when this was designed. The engine and wings are especially interesting.

This set has lot's of hidden items, features, and functionality: The missle compartment, the spring loaded gun, the landing gears, the weapons stash.  Even the cockpit's opening mechanism was creative.  

Sturdy construction.

I was disappointed that only one of the mini-figs fit in the ship.

The Juno Eclipse minifigure is all new too. The ship itself with an opening cockpit has plenty of room for any of the figures. A flap on the ship opens to reveal a cannon that automatically shoots, and a hyperdrive back engine that flips the wings. One flaw about this is that the wings cannot flip completely when the ship is stationary. It has to be airborne for that to transpire. Another flaw- the support legs for this ship are absolutely flimsy and are only present to aggravate the owner. Also, I don't understand why a store of guns is included in a compartment of the ship.

"David1971","2008-10-02T12:26:45Z","A bit of an odd-looking ship","This is a good Lego version of the Rogue Shadow ship designed by Lucasfilm, and has lots of clever hidden-away bits and bobs, and a good wing-rotating mechanism. (Amazon UK was selling it at 23 per cent off the standard price, which was a good thing too).

The original design of the ship, though, is not that nice. The classic Star Wars ships such as the X-Wing and the TIE fighters were very cool, sleek, and symmetrical. This is a bit clunky and I personally very much dislike the lack of symmetry, so it has different wierd big bits sticking out on the left and the right.

The three minifigs are nice, but this of course leads to the other notable problem with this set - only one of them can fly in it at once, despite its rather huge proportions! What an oversight. Darth Vader has to leave both his apprentice and his pilot at home when he goes off on a mission. No wonder he ended up 'battle-damaged'. Add some seats for your crew, Darth! They might be helpful. Mr Vader really is not a team player, is he?

Not many sets have this very rare &quot;pro&quot;, but this set does. Anyways, this set comes with three multi-rare minifigs and a great model that fires a hidden missile and comes with two drop-out missiles. Also, the wings and engine adjust easily, the landing gears go up and come down, and the cockpit is easily accessible. One other thing that I have to say is that this set's model was designed very creatively: the shape of the wings, the shape and placement of the engine, and the whole cut-down-the-middle sceme of the front of the ship all add to this.

But I believe it to be a great set for anybody now and it makes me even more excited for the video game, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed to come out!!  This set is all black which made me happy because most imperial sets have the blue on it that I'm not very fond of.  Landing gear is great on it, making it easy for it to come out or put away.  I really like the all of the weapons on it including: The launch missile, two flick missiles,  and four guns on the front for detail.  There are several accessories including the gun storage area that holds to rifles on the right side, The booster on the back, when pushed up, the wings are pushed up also, a compartment to put one figure in (which I wasn't a big fan of) and only one sticker thank goodness.  The characters are also very cool with battle damaged Darth Vader, Juno Eclipse, and Vader's secret apprentice.  Vader's secret apprentice is way cool which basically makes this set a reason to buy.

However I pretty much have every model now so went into my local shop and it was a choice between this or &quot;The Twilight&quot;. The figures included in the Twilight set are the same as the figures in the new Clone wars AT-TE so I went for the Rogue instead.

This is one of the quickest, and most satisfying Star Wars lego models I have ever built.
Numbered bags made it really easy, I was able to build it on my lap whilst watching TV and my drinking a cup of tea.

Each bag builds a seperate module which eventually all join together to make the ship.
There was little repetition so didn't get tiresome.

The finished model looks great, very aggresive. The rotating engine looks very smart and works well with the turning foils.

The asymetrical design looks good, almost like a super Tie-bomber in style.

There are lots of hidden compartments and extras. The opening cockpit works well, with a clever mechanism. The launching missile workd really well for me and looks impressive.

People have said it's not great as it doesn't hold all the figures but I don't feel this to be an issue, it's a super charged 1 person gunship, not a troop carrier.

I feel the use of a divers helmet to simulate a battle damaged one is a great idea, i'd prefer this to using many &quot;custom&quot; one off pieces.

They had the ship broken down into pieces that you built from individually numbered bags. I was intrigued to find out that the broken vader mask was just an inverted aquazone mask, however I feel the vader figure is a good representation of the vader after Starkiller whoops up on him in TFU. The cockpit could afford a resizing, and the extensive use of canons seems to overdo it compared to the videogame model. (maybe this was developed off of an early concept sketch of the Rogue Shadow?)

Pros

1) The levers on the sides to operate the missiles and the spring-loaded projectile are really a cool feature, as are the rotating wings on the sides.

2) The mini-figs!  My daughter loves the female characters so Juno was a big hit.

3) The storage spot for two blasters (although if it had room for two lightsabers instead that would have been better).  I geek out over hidden compartments!

4) Holds together well when ""flying"" around the basement :)


Cons

1) Landing gear comes off easily

2) I wish there was a bit more space in the area behind the cockpit so that the Apprentice could ride in the ship (a mini-fig can fit in now but then you can't close the roof all the way).

I went on to build this ship and was amazed of how it was after, the actual ship is sleak in my opinion and very playable. One of the thing I liked about this is the booster at the back and how it is an unconventional design. The ship is quite big but easy to swoop around, wings at first looked very weak and I thought it would fall off but was actually very sturdy.

It's just an ugly and quite frankly odd looking ship. The way the wings and engine move into ""flight"" mode leave bright yellow pieces right in plain view that just don't look right on this grey/black ship. The landing gear feet fall off any time I move it and the two smaller missles are pointless. You can't flick them or fire them in any way and they don't even look cool.</p><p>The cockpit opening is kind of a cool design though and the mechanism for firing the big missle is really clever. Plus I like the minifigs even though there is no place for Vader's Apprentice to sit in the ship because the cockpit can only hold Juno.&nbsp;</p><p>To sum up, it's&nbsp;ugly, the landing gear constantly falls off, so do the other missles that are useless, and a Battle Damaged Darth Vader minifig is just not reason worth getting this set. </p><p>Pass on the ship but if you find the minifigs by themselves get those.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,2

But after a lot of taking apart and putting back together I got it looking right!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After construction, I couldn't believe how big and bulky it was! I only own two other spaceships, the&nbsp;original x-wing fighter from 1999 and also the the naboo starfighter from around the same time. This dwarfs both of them! It's pretty solid, so its fine to 'swoosh' around without worrying its going to break, and has lots of playability in terms of a pop out cannon that fires a missile, a hidden compartment with 2 imperial blaster rifles, and another missile storage compartment, though I have trouble shooting them out. I think they are supposed to be flick out, but I still fail at it!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One issue I have with the ship is the cockpit simply will not fit Galen Marek and and Juno, its either one or the other, which is a shame as in the force unleashed game you see that the cockpit can hold Master Kota and PROXY as well as Marek and Juno. so it is a dissapointment only one character can fit in the ship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The mini figures are fantastic with this set. The Marek figure has some form of training outfit on, with a bandaged wound from where he was stabbed by vader,&nbsp;(though in the game he never actually has a bandage on!) Vader comes in battle damaged form, with two alternate head pieces, either his helmet of an upside down divers mask piece which looks suprisingly like a shattered helmet. Juno is also brilliantly done, with either a blonde hair piece or a pilots cap. What I like about the facial printing is that with the cap on, she has a fringe printed on her forehead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So aside from the tiny ammount of room in the cockpit,&nbsp;in all this is a fantastic set. Its a shame it didnt come with any interesting pieces, exclusive to this set, like perhaps a sith holocron, or something so as you could make the apprentice into the alternate evil version unlockable at the end of the game. But this set is definately brilliant, an accurate depiction of the&nbsp;Rogue Shadow&nbsp;in the force unleashed, and a must have if you plan on starting&nbsp;a Rebel Alliance!</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"raymondg","2011-08-03T19:54:22.313Z","Great and unjustly overlooked little gem!","I recently purchased this set and I was pleasantly surprised by it. Although this ship is largely unknown as it only appeared in a SW videogame, the model itself is outstanding in every way. This is one of those rare asymmetrical models and although it mostly fails aesthetically, this one seems to pull it off. Playability of this one is through the roof; It offers the most play features I ever saw in one vehicle / ship! Overall it is quite sturdy and landing gear falling off is something I did not experience nor foresee in the future. I guess it's all a matter of proper assembly...<br>The colors are mostly grey and black so it may seem a tad boring to look at but that's all a matter of taste. It certainly will stand out in your SW collection where most stuff is grey and white.<br><br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Sturdy and quite swooshable <br></li><li>Lots of play features like: a catapult-like missilething, a 'missile-silo' and a gun compartment. <br></li><li>A very nice cockpit with a mechanism similar to the top hatch of the Republic MTT<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Color palette may seem a bit dull but in real life it looks the bomb!</li></ul><br>In summary I can wholeheartedly say: buy it if you find it for a 
reasonable price as most of today's models certainly pale in comparison

"Chills","2012-10-12T09:45:20.867Z","The ship that helped start the Rebellion... according to The Force Unleashed.","<p>I'm a fan of ""The Force Unleashed"" video game, which is what prompted me to get this unusual set. Overall I think this is a decent set, it has some cool features, but it isn't great and it feels lacking in some areas.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: LEGO did a pretty good job taking a video game ship and turning it into a set. The Rogue Shadow is a highly unusual-looking starship, it has engines off to one side, the wings are different on each side, the cockpit is far back and behind part of the fuselage, and the fuselage itself is asymmetrical. All are reflected accurately in the set.</li><li>Pro 2: The build is pretty fun. There are 8 different sections and all are held together with Technic pins and bricks. This is quite a different building technique than what you normally see with SW ships.</li><li>Pro 3: There is good playability with this set. It is sturdy, swooshable, and has quit a few features. Each section of the fuselage opens up to reveal hidden weapons, and the cockpit actually hinges back in a most unusual way. The engine bank also rotates, which causes the wings to rotate from horizontal to vertical.&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 4: I really dig the minifigures. Starkiller (our hero) has some good detail on his body, as does Juno Eclipse. Vader is the best, though, with a battle damaged helmet (actually a diver's mask turned sideways) and body.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The biggest negative about this set is its unfinished feel. There are no bottoms to the fuselage, its just open. I understand its part of the design to allow access to the weapons, but it makes the ship feel like LEGO forgot to add pieces. The same goes for parts of the fuselage. On the starboard side the top part, which rotates up, just kind of sits on the sides with a large gap in the pieces. It just looks unfinished and not up to the usual LEGO refinement.</li><li>Con 2: Even though 3 minifigures are cool this set should have had Proxy, too. Not only is he integral to the plot of the game, but he would make a really cool mini figure for your collection.</li></ul>
<p>Overall I am pleased with this set, but I don't think it is one of LEGO's best efforts. It is a cool set, fun to build, but the unfinished feel keeps me from giving it more than 3 bricks. The minifigures are great, and one of the reasons I wanted this set. Unless you must have all SW sets or are a big fan of the video game I would say most collectors can pass on this one.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,4

"psychman7","2013-08-28T22:11:09.257Z","Star Wars Set #11: 7672 Rogue Shadow","Even though this set doesn't come from the six films, it's a pretty cool ship. It's packed with features like the TIE crawler, and it looks amazing.<div><br></div><div><b>Box/Instructions:</b></div><div>The box is a decent size for a fifty-dollar set. It looks intimidating as it flies over Mustafar, firing its missiles from it's port-side...wing, I guess you could call it. And for the first time, I got a box that contained numbered bags. They play a pretty great role later in the Star Wars line, especially as you approach 2010. I believe this is the only 2008 set that had numbered bags. I have no complaints, though. It makes the building more fun and interesting. Eight numbered bags are included in this set. This is a thing that will appear in most of my reviews: what each numbered bag holds. They too will have their own section of the review.</div><div>-Bag One contains the three minifigures and the cockpit of the ship.</div><div>-Bag Two contains the rear starboard section of the ship.</div><div>-Bag Three contains the starboard ""wing"". Let's just stick with that term.</div><div>-Bag Four contains the rear port section of the ship.</div><div>-Bag Five contains port wing, as well as the section that crosses in front of the cockpit.</div><div>-Bag Six contains some extra detailing. (landing gear, weapons, and outer armor)</div><div>-Bag Seven contains the starboard-side wings. These don't use quotes, because they legitimately are wings.</div><div>-Bag Eight contains the port-side wing and the special weapon.</div><div>The instructions are split into two booklets. Book one constructs bags one through five, and bag two constructs bags six through eight. The build goes so much faster this way.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Stickers:</b></div><div>There are only three stickers here, and all of them are the Imperial logo. To be honest, only one is used, and is placed on the port-side rear section.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Pieces:</b></div><div>Lots of black and dark gray pieces are used here, but that's how most sinister Imperial ships look. The technic shooter is introduced once again, put into the ship at bag six, but I'll get more in-depth about that later. The cockpit piece is also a great piece to have.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigures:</b></div><div>All of the minifigures are built in bag one. The first one built is the battle-damaged Darth Vader. He is an excellent figure, and I love his ""blown-up helmet"" piece. He also includes a full helmet. Starkiller is the next figure, and he is probably the best figure of the set. Like Vader, he includes a red lightsaber. The front detailing is phenomenal, so I wouldn't mess with him. The third figure is officer Juno Eclipse. She also has two headpieces. One of them is a black officer cap, and the other is her blonde hair. She is also a very great figure.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Rogue Shadow:</b></div><div>I'll divide the review into eight sections, because of how many numbered bags are included.</div><div><u>Bag One:</u></div><div>The first thing to be constructed is the cockpit module. When finished, the cockpit can open up to fit one minifigure inside (I've put Juno in there most of the time). There is also a little back compartment, and I use that to store a weapon of some sort. When Starkiller pilots the ship, that's where I store his lightsaber. I would say the cockpit could open at the front, but seeing as it gets blocked off by the crossblock (which I will talk about later), it doesn't really count as a feature.</div><div><u>Bag Two:</u></div><div>After the cockpit is finished off, you build the rear starboard section. This is how the rotating wing mechanism is born. As you rotate the awesome-looking engine module, it rotates a technic gear, which will move the wings. The gear is yellow, so it stands out in contrast to the almost-completely-black ship. Nonetheless, the feature is very much effective.</div><div><u>Bag Three:</u></div><div>The front starboard section contains the panel in which the technic shooter pops out. The shooter itself isn't built in this part, the panel is. The panel opens up almost all the way back.</div><div><u>Bag Four:</u></div><div>The rear port section contains two ""flick-fire missiles"". They aren't really flick-fire, but they are removable. A lever at the side of the ship pops them up. Sometimes they actually come out of their spots, so it's somewhat effective.</div><div><u>Bag Five:</u></div><div>The front port section is thinner than the starboard side, but it too has a panel that you can open almost completely the whole way. In this section, however, is a storage area for two blaster rifles. This section also builds the crossblock, which prevents the windscreen from opening outward as mentioned in Bag One.</div><div><u>Bag Six:</u></div><div>More detail is added to the ship as you begin the second manual and the sixth bag. The shooter is added into the starboard panel, where it pops out with a lever underneath. when the shooter's lever makes contact with the edge of the ship, the shooter pops out. The shooter, of course, isn't added until last. The landing gear is also attached to the ship. It folds in and out as it flies and lands. Finally, the weapons are added onto the ship.</div><div><u>Bag Seven:</u></div><div>The starboard-side wing is added. There really isn't a feature to this, except it rotates thanks to the mechanics of Bag Two.</div><div><u>Bag Eight:</u></div><div>The port-side with is now added on, as well as the rocket. That completes the ship, basically.</div><div><u>Overall:</u></div><div>When finished, the ship looks very nice and sinister. The asymmetry is a good look for the ship. The one thing you have to keep in mind is that you should fold up the landing gear before turning the wing mechanism. When that's done, you're good to go and ready to fly!</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Final Verdict:</b></div><div>Pieces - 10/10 - A great selection of parts, especially the cockpit and technic shooter.</div><div>Stickers - 10/10 - Only three, and only one is used!</div><div>Minifigures - 10/10 - All excellent!</div><div>Rogue Shadow - 9/10 - The missile function (not the shooter) doesn't work as well as one would like, so that docks a couple points.</div><div><br></div><div>Final result - 9.75/10 - A very nice and fun ship that's loaded with fun. Enjoy it!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
