"tomahawker","2008-01-03T21:44:43.14Z","Too much, Magic Bus!","This is a nicely designed set that suffers from a few annoying flaws.  

The build is in 3 steps, each with a numbered bag.  Step 1 is the minfigs, bus stop, and ticket dispenser.  The Patrick and SpongeBob minifigs have been seen in other sets, but the bus driver is a new.  The fish head is perfect, with the classic scowl exhibited by Bikini Bottom residents when SpongeBob is around.  The fish head even features a dorsal fin!  The ticket machine has internal storage and includes 6 1x2 tile &quot;tickets&quot; with a simple dispensing mechanism.  The bus stop sign is simple but effective, and interestingly includes separate stickers for the left and right quarter circle bricks.  This eliminates the need for a STAMP, but leaves an obvious line up the middle of the sign.

Step 2 is the body of the bus.  The bus itself is very colorful, and the build is straightforward, with all studs-up construction, except for the headlights and clear &quot;cheese: slopes around the windshield.  The bus is small with just 3 seats, including the bus driver's seat.  The portholes are clear 2 x 3 thin walls that are painted inside.  These wall sections are semi-translucent, so the painted orange does not match well with the orange bricks.  Also, the bus driver must lean back, since his cap interferes with a red arch over his seat.  Consequently, the driver is barely visible through the windshield, unlike the box illustration.

Step 3, is the top of the bus and periscope, plus the fins and propeller on the rear of the bus.  The top is very sturdy and is constructed from a nice selection of orange slopes and curved pieces.  The top is held on by 10 studs and so removes easily to insert and remove passengers.  The periscope is a simple construction, but it is held on by a single stud and falls off easily.  The fins attach with click hinges and along with the propeller complete the model.

In summary, the minifigs are great, and the bus is a nice selection of orange parts, marred by the poor color match of the porthole pieces and the inability to place the driver as shown on the box.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.

"JC3275","2008-01-17T20:33:09.78Z","great set","This is a fun set.  The only part I didn't like was the driver must lean back to fit with is hat on, but thats only a minor detail.  This set was a surprise &quot;get well&quot; gift from one of my best friends since I just got home from the hospital.  It was very entertaining and I did like the fact it was divided into three &quot;step&quot; bags with all the minifig parts in the first bag.  The bus could have been made to fit a few more minifigs, but that doesn't detract from this set as it seats all figures included, unlike alot of sets that leave out someone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"donneyboy","2008-10-11T21:35:16.077Z","i finally own this","well today i found this set at wal-mart, i havent seen this set in about 7 months, so i had to choose between this and the 20 dollar castle set so i chose this one. now on to the review-
the build is really simple and short (if you dont watch t.v. like i do), you really dont need the instruction booklet on some parts. the bus driver minifig is just awesome, i love the new head, and i needed another suit torso, nothing special about patrick, same one that was in the one with his house, spongbobs pineapple, and squidwards house, and spongebob, well he is just a normal spongbob fig. the ticket dispenser is really great, how the tickets come out and everything, the bus is cool, the white wheels will be useful fo other mocs, and the orange will be good for my general lee moc. all in all i give this set a 4.5/5 because i think it could be improved a little bit.

"cassidyarch","2008-06-14T17:31:18.81Z","All aboard the Fishbus!","This set was purchased as a compromise between myself, my six year old son and my two year old daughter.
Unbelievably, we all ended up REALLY liking it!

A great orange parts pack. The curving slopes on the top are a left/right set, not the solid windscreen piece. The fish bus driver is a great, bizarre minifig. And the wheels are WHITE RUBBER. Do these exist elsewhere? Great for moonroving space MOCs.

Great little set. With a lot of nice, unique bits.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"galonschiente","2009-09-05T13:10:40.67Z","What kind of nonsense can sponge and pat get up to at the bus stop?","Galonschiente again with the bikini bottom express review! Got it for my birthday and built it in 15 minutes! Pros and cons like last time.

Pros: Angry Bus driver (can fit a hat on)
        Kelp peice (just love it)
         Ticket dispenser (actually dispenses tickets)
        Bus (flabbergasting design)

Cons: Bus driver has yellow hands (Like Mr. Krabs has Grey!?)
          Bus stop sign is flimsy (not too flimsy butstill flimsy, nonetheless)


This set is a delightful biuld for kids and adults alike and not that challenging, so if you can find it pick it up! ;-(=)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"alva","2011-03-03T00:25:05.09Z","Another Great Job for the Spongebob Sets","Again, Lego has proved that they can create resemblance with the real thing.<br>I remembered the Spongebob episodes from which this bus came from, and Lego really doing a great job for recreating that episode into bricks.<br>The bus is design very detail. Really fun to build and to play with. You can actually use the ticket dispenser to really dispense a ticket. Cute!<br>You also will get the Fish Bus Driver, which you can not get from any other set.<br><br>There's only one point that I don't like from this set&nbsp; I think they should use a larger plate, so the ticket box and the bus sign can be put on one plate, not in two different plates. But this problem can easily solved.<br><br>So, Spongebob lovers, go get this set. It is definitely worth collecting!<br><br>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4

The minifigs are just basic Spongebob and Patrick and the driver's hands are yellow :\. The bus stop is too plain.&nbsp;The actual bus was pretty nice and detailed.
