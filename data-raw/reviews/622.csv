I've always been a fan of spyrius but i hate that design.  besides that though, the set is really good and i love the figures.  The box is neat aand worth keeping.  the combo sets were always really cool. overall i would get it for the figures and the catapault, but not the space ship",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
