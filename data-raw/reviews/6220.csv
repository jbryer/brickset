"Rgijaba","2008-03-23T20:48:19.39Z","hey, sandy! i see your poorly made rocket, but wheres your  tree dome...","this set is pretty dull, and the rocket is ugly... even with out the stickers (witch i put on)... this set comes with: Sany Cheeks (wheres her flower?), Spongebob Squrepants (in a space suit), Patrick Star (also in a space suit), and some &quot;moon&quot; jelly fish... who are more related to coral than fish (true fact)! anyway,  this would have been pretty good if it were Sandys tree dome, if way more expenceive... the rocket is big and ugly, and realy stupid looking... the sets also based on one of my LEAST favorite episodes! theres also a little sea weed clump with some jellys stuck to it for some readson, and it also (how odd!) has a &quot;Sandy&quot; slag on it for sum reason... the rockets interior is also pretty cramped, and contains some odly colored doo-dads in it, and a place for the odd rovers &quot;moon jelly fish&quot; tank on it, and the rover is also very weird and out of place, also being ugly, but still better looking than the rocket. it comes with some rare jelly fishing nets, and theyre a plus, and so are the jellies, who can be put in your LEGO jelly fish feilds, and your minifigs can go jelly fishing! all-in-all, get it if your a big spongebob fan, wanst some jelly fish, or are DEASPERATE for a LEGO rocket. also, our moon's name is Luna (true fact).",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"alva","2011-03-03T00:17:31.943Z","A Snapshop from Spongebob Episode","What I love about the Spongebob sets done by Lego is they really create a real detail sets based on the real episodes from Spongebob. If you are a real Spongebob fans, you will definitely remember from what episode they come from.<br><br>Very great set, and you got three minifigs (Spongebob, Patrick, and Sandy), all using special astronaut costumes that you wont get from any other set, other than this set and the magnet. <br><br>What also interesting is how the designer can come up with the idea of using pink Cook's Hat for representing the jellyfish. Really great idea.<br><br>The building process is quite fast since the rocket is not build from bricks, but using panels. <br><br>What I don't like from this set is that they use too many stickers. The rockets is basically covered with stickers, inside and outside. What I hate about stickers is that in time, they will loose their adhesiveness and start to peel off.<br><br>So for recap, for you guys Spongebob fans, just go buy this set. I think this will serve you better than the Pineapple house if you like to play with it.<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
"legofanatic2414","2009-03-24T23:39:02.653Z","3..........2...........1...... LIFT OFF!"," this is a cool set! it comes with a spongebob (space suit) patrick (space suit) and the FIRST ever Sandy miifig! 


                            THE ROCKET

           well the rocket is very awsome it is very detailed on the outside and  
on the inside BUT the ship falls apart VERY easily. it is great for imaginative playing but it can break! but the ship is still cool

                           OTHER STUFF

              Sandy comes with a cool moon buggy! that has a connecter to the ""alien"" jellyfish container. the wooden platform is cool it works too it just needs a little push. and i like the little plants its a cool place to house jellyfish

                   PROS: 
                        first sandy minifig
                         cool rocket
                         moon buggy
                         platform

                   CONS:
                       ship is to fragile
                             none  
                                                    I GIVE IT A 4/5

"legospongepotter","2010-03-05T18:40:29.45Z","Pretty Good","It is actually a pretty good set, despite the fact I don't often play with it (I make lego videos and post them on YouTube under the name haqq17). I mainly use Sandy, put the moon rover that comes with it is pretty sweet, and the rocket has a bunch of cool stuff inside like:

The guns Spongebob and Pat use in the episode Sandy's Rocket
A fire extinguisher
A hammer
Two cool computers
a storage area

Really, the Treedome would be much better and I don't see why Lego couldn't make it  but it is a cool set with cool minfigures. Overall, I give it a  4/5",FALSE,4,4,4,3,4
