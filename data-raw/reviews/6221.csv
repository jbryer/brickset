"STK","2008-01-19T06:20:18.06Z","It's okay","First, there is definatly NO Rat in this set as described.

I like the Design of the Wagon, because it just looks like its built by trolls. I also like the mechanism (hidden behind the flag, which can be moved down) of how the missiles can be shoot out. You have to load it once, and you can shoot out 3 times - like an early mashinegun or something. The thing with the chicken leg is a funny idea, but sadly the lance is too short, so the big troll easily can eat it ;) The little warrior has a new helm and a brown big sword.

The little handcart of the knights is nicely built and looks just good. they come along wit only a crossbow and spear - So they have no chance against the big wagon.

Overall you get a good set with 2 human knights, one little &quot;troll&quot; and a big one. The Assault Wagon does its job being a warmashine and thats it :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"frogstudio","2008-03-10T22:14:49.09Z","Great set","Really nice set.  Great design and minifig selection. The little cart for the Crownies is a bit strange (wheels too big for such a small carrying space). The sand green troll is awesome, and I specially like the detail of the chicken leg. Anyway, if I were you, I'd rush to get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greenfrog_7","2008-05-09T02:23:03.013Z","Troll Assault Wagon... makes me hungry","So this set looks great, and I love having it on display as it really is a great one that captures the feeling that I think LEGO should have. It all looks pretty neat, the banner, the spikes, the ogre chasing the food. However I feel that it doesn't live up to the potential it could have had. The overall construction seems very minimal and leaves me wishing for more pieces and more structure that isn't the repeating cannon (which works and is also pretty neat - don't get me wrong). Mostly I feel that my opinion of this set was influenced by the earlier Skeleton Prison Carriage which set the bar pretty high for Wagon-type sets.

Still a good pick up, though not the equal of the Skeleton Prison Carriage.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legobuilderguy","2008-05-31T16:48:47.983Z","Revamp?","Okay, had to get this one when I saw it a few days ago since it had one of the ogre (I know Lego calls it a giant troll) figures. Now since I have put it together here we go. First off, the giant green ogre is great, looks a little Duplo-ish but not too much so. This set also includes an Orc with a bronze colored sword which is very nice. Also this adds to the knight army with two more soldiers and nice little cart for them as well. The assault wagon looks very orcish with it's slapped together look and uses the same catapult action from the Viking sets which works very well.Now with that said onto the Pro's and Con's if you please.

Pro's:
1 ogre
1 Orc
2 knights
1 brown crossbow
1 classic short sword
2 classic cart wheels

Con's:
No Ogre weapon
no quiver for the crossbow
chicken leg bait staff is too short

All in all this is a good set for the money (19.99 here) and doesn't look to bad at all next to the others from the line such as  Tower raid #7037 and Battle Wheel #7041. The only real complaint I have is the lack of weapons for the orcs, but a quick call to Lego solved that very handily and they weren't too expensive so I ordered 10 more to have spares as well.

"Urgthetroll","2008-06-29T16:33:17.373Z","Cool, But not enough Trolls (Orcs).","Awesome set, but there are a few mistakes.  First, sometimes the flag gets stuck while it moves past the the missile launcher.  I hate it when it happens.  The Troll(Orc)forces are not very strong because there is only one Orc(not counting the big one). In all, I give           it a :@.

"Lint","2008-07-17T12:21:08.983Z","Buying the wagon for the giant troll","Pro's
*Giant Troll!
*Aweosome 'hidden' spring-fire cannon
*3 minifigs
*You get some interesting pieces: horns, chains etc

Con's
*Giant Troll has no weapon (unless you count the 2 chains) I would have liked the giant club mounted somewhere on the way.
*Would have appreciated a/some troll or even knight shields
*Whip doesn't really extend far enough to dangle chicken at 'suitable' distance
*Would have liked a shield or armour instead of a crossbow in the knight's cart.
*Chicken is kind of poor upon inspection.

Overall this set wins more on principle than content. You're buying it because its an assault wagon pulled by a giant troll with a 'sneaky' cannon hidden behind the orc banner. Unfortunately the 2 long halberds are vital for supporing the orc banner so I'm not counting them as usable weapons.

For what you pay, it leaves quite a bit to be desired. Once again, I got it on sale, so I don't feel so bad.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-08-22T16:33:10.827Z","Cool set all together","I finally got it at target. It was easy enough to build, and the missles are quite a nice touch!

Pros:
A giant troll
Chicken leg is funny idea
Neat missles
Crownies have a lot of weapons to chose from
Wagen is easily moveable and is pretty sturdy

Cons:
A small set
Big troll has no weapon and looks like a slave
Only 2 trolls


You can put this set with the seige tower set, as the loose crownie can go in the prison tower

A pretty good set overall, i love the new troll theme!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-19T23:09:31.64Z","STOP CALLING THEM ORCS! :(","Look, people, if Lego says they're trolls, they're freakin' TROLLS! THEY ARE NOT ORCS! They are big trolls and little trolls! Got it?! Now that that is out of the way  this set is GREAT! Since my computer is a piece of **** and I couldn't post this review earlier, I will just give you the basics.

Pros:
good number of figs
troll wagon has a slapped-together-in-twenty-minutes look that I really believe
I'm all about the giant troll
knights have extra weapon
shooter is NICE

Cons:
could come with one more troll
I don't like Technic pieces in regular sets. In Bionicle sets,sure, but not in regular Lego",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"allencao3","2008-12-23T04:50:47.747Z","A tamed ogre pulling a menacing wagon","Another great set from the fantasy castle theme! I noticed a relatively low average score on here, which I guess is a result that some of the larger-scaled sets of the theme set really high expectations in our minds. But I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes castle.

Firstly, it is really funny to see how obedient a gigantic creature like an ogre could be because of some tasty chicken leg. I gotta admit the design of this is kinda basic and somehow childish but it just feels right. Now onto the pros and cons.

Pros:
- The chicken thing as mentioned
- Another ogre in a different color (sand green works equally well for me as tan for an ogre)
- Another banner for orcs. When the orc army grows in size, more banners will be needed.
- An orc warrior with a bronze scimitar! The bronze scimitar looks a great lot better than the grayish one. Gotta have more of those.
- The design of the stand for the mounted missiles and banner is awesome. Therefore, parts for the stand from this set could be of great use in future.
- Cool missile launch thing. With the parts available in this set, I can easily design another ballista that shoots far better than the lame 7090 for the crownies.

Cons:
- The chicken bait is not long enough that the ogre can easily reach it if everything is put according to the manual. But it can easily be solved if you put the chains one or two studs backwards. Not really a con in this sense.
- It feels a little empty on the wagon especially at the back. On the other hand, either loading on a few orcs or adding a bit of accessories would make the wagon more intimidating and well-defended and simply add to the playability of the set.
- I am not a big fan of the sand green color of the tusks. It goes with the ogre and orc but what kind of tusk is in this color?
- Umm…The small cart might be the ugliest thing ever!
- Last but not least, I am not fond of the new torsos of crownie soldiers in 2008 but that’s just me.

To sum up, a solid 9/10 for the set but on a 1 to 5 scale, I would give it a 5 I guess because I got it on sale. lol

I had seen the clicker things before, but i didn't know how to shoot it. I figured out that you have to let go fast to shoot. On to the pros and cons!

Pros:
-Rare Pieces(chicken leg, giant trool, clicker, etc.)
-Giant troll pulls the wagon
-Many Knight weapons

Cons:
-Sometimes, if you shoot the rocket really hard, the other two missiles go under the wagon
-Giant troll has no club
-Little wagon does not hold weapons very well

Overall: 9.5/10

AWESOME SET!

"CrzyLCF","2009-06-24T21:31:51.497Z","Great troll wagon.","This is another wicked castle set for $28. It comes with a menacing looking wagon with four gigantic wheels and missiles hiding behind the troll banner to surprise the brave knights, a giant troll who is obligated to pull the wagon only because of a turkey leg hypnotizing him wherever it goes, the most utterly horrible cart ever seen in LEGO history, 4 weapons (bronze scimitar, crossbow, spear and sword), 2 peasant knights and 1 troll warrior.<br><br>The Troll wagon is well designed and it has plenty of detail such as the green bones and the spikes that make it look more menacing. The Troll banner is a clever disguise for the knights who think there is nothing possible hiding behind that banner, but as soon as it is pulled back there are 3 missiles going right at them! (yes they are outsmarted by not so intelligent trolls...) The firing system behind the banner is nice and quick. Once you shoot one missile, the next missile is ready. I really like the idea of the giant troll pulling the wagon only because of a chicken leg dangling right in front of him. The only thing that disappoints me about the wagon is that there is so much room at the back of it and it lacks some troll warriors.<br><br>There is only one thing that I will mention about the cart. It is a total disgrace to all of the other LEGO carts. Like come on LEGO! You know you could have done a way better job on a cart than this... but oh well, it is how it is.<br><br>Overall, despite the cart this set is really great and if you have the siege tower, troll warship and the troll battle wheel combined with this set, it will take tens of thousands of knights to stop the almighty trolls!<br><br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"thejoker34","2010-02-14T17:34:25.45Z","The trolls are on the move!","This set is a great castle set if you can only afford smaller sets. Good if trying to build a troll army.
Minfigures-Troll-10/10-This troll is regular but is still cool. Helmet looks like stone.
Giant troll-10/10-oh my gosh this is awesome. The giant troll has spikes that run down it's back along with huge arms. armor makes him look even cooler. 
Knight1-9/10-nothing special but not bad.
Knight 2-10/10-same as above.

wheelbarrow-10/10-a great little knight vehicle. However it doesn't do anything...

Troll assault wagon-10/10-a nice battle machine perfect for battle. Flick fire missiles add to the fun. Also wheels look as if they are made out of stone and luke rugged and beat. There is room to fit trolls on the wagon. Also to make it look even cooler it has crossbars on it for details. The flag is nice but is easily lost (at least for me)

Perhaps I don’t entirely disagree.</div><div><br></div><div>By now my love for Trolls is well-documented, but don’t worry: I’m not shy about continuing to extol Troll virtues again. Every aspect of the titular Troll Assault Wagon is awesome: the “rib cage” spikes, the large, speckled wheels, and the cobbled-together look of the ballista mechanism all spell certain doom for any Human antagonists silly enough to get in the way. The assault wagon looks great next to the siege engine from Tower Raid (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7037-1"">7037</a>), and together will form the backbone of any Troll army.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Just one Troll Minifig comes with this set, most likely because this set comes with an elusive Giant Troll, an absolute boon to the forces of evil. Another Troll to work the missiles would have been a great addition to this set, but a pair of Human soldiers round out the Minifig count to this set.</div><div><br></div><div>What? You mean that there’s something else in this set besides the assault wagon? Why, yes, there is, if you look really close. The two generic Human soldiers come with a wagon of their own, only that it’s as unimpressive as the assault wagon is sweet. In fact, considering that none of these extraneous components are barely worth mentioning, I have to wonder why they were not ditched in favour of another Troll Minifig and perhaps some accessories. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But I doubt you’ll find that the shortfalls of the Humans detract from the Troll Assault Wagon itself, and whether you already have experience with some Troll sets or have a desire to begin collecting them, this is a great place to begin.
