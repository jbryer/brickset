"mrmitch","2008-08-03T11:39:31.247Z","Construction crew gets added man &amp; machine","LEGO doesn't put out enough of these liitle sets in my opinion. Simple to build, unique addition to the construction crew in my City. The drum does rotate when you turn the handle at the front of the wheel barrel. If you have any collection at all I'm sure you may have another shovel he can use - agree it should have been included with the set. Price is right, works well with the other crew mempbers in my city - a good buy - great little set. You will be happy to have him in your collection, I recommend this one highly.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-13T13:49:54.843Z","Another Great Impulse Sets for 2008","2008 is a great year to stock up on impulse sets. This one is a very good addition, as I doubt that many of you have a cement mixer in your collection. Even better if City is your main priority. At that price, you just can't pass it up before the prices rise again.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"_obelix_","2008-12-11T16:56:27.81Z","First set i am giving less then 5!","This is a good little set. Good but not great. As with other impulses this set has i minifig, a cart with a cement mixer, some left-over cement for playing and that's it. This set would have been great if only it had two small parts: a shovel, and something to hold it. It would have been great and would fit right beside the mixer. Without it it's still a good set for building up your city.

This brings up the final, a 4 out of 5.

"lotographia","2009-03-15T20:44:11.623Z","A small set with a nifty gimmick.","The gimmick of this set is that if you push it forward, the wheels also spin the barrel. This is the smallest set I've seen with a movement-based gimmick like that, and it's implemented with a neat, simple design.

As a previous reviewer noted, this set really should come with a shovel. That's why I'm not giving it a five, which I would have for the gimmick alone.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"galonschiente","2009-06-26T15:15:21.217Z","MINIFIG FACE","I really enjoy lego sets especially this one bcause of the minifigure's face

  Pros:
  Face
  Price Â£2

  Cons:
  Should be more wheels to keep upright
  Not much playability


 This set is fantastic i got it at asda. This set could have had an extra set of wheels but its still perfecto!

"legomaniac","2009-08-31T00:14:52.327Z","Great little mixer","I got it last week on sale, must say I love to have many construction workers as possable, and the mixer is perfect for fixing lego potholes in the road.

     As others say i like how the drum rolls on the wheels making it turn, he could of had a shovel though, but I have plenty of spare ones.  

Also I never had the cone shaped part before, use that piece for a jet engine",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kaboomlegoman","2010-01-03T17:36:31.903Z","bad.","I'm serious, this set has some serious issues. First of all, the cement pieces are really annoying and get lost easily. The spinning thing doesn't go far. And you have to spin the steering wheel really hard to get them out. Really, I am dissapointed. The minifigure is basic and pathetic. Overall, really bad set and don't get it.:(",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Boidoh","2010-12-22T16:09:45.493Z","Small, Boring and Ugh!","<p>This set is quite small and boring on its own. I understand that its an impulse set but really, why cant it be likes it brother ""5611 Public Works"" with 31 pieces and many stuff, that set was like a 5 usd set. Ok back to the review, this set would go GREAT with the Front End Loader and the Dozer and I know, i have them. Now to the pros and cons:</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>A minifigure (well thats what impulse sets are about. collecting minifigure at a small price) 
<li>Little cement mixer 
<li>A wheel i havent seen in ages</li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Well where i live its for 9 Belize Dollars which is 4.50 US Dollars, so its not such a good deal. 
<li>Lacks Pieces 
<li>The cement mixer doesnt turn very well 
<li>Not good on its own</li></ul>
<p>Its a nice set for any construction fan or city fan. But not on its own. The people in the US would have it at a better price, maybe about $6.50 in Belize currency so&nbsp;i cant talk the price for the people up there.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"CMoore","2009-10-02T18:27:20.577Z","good set","This set is real nice but there are some pros and cons.

pros
- it has a nice minifig
- it does not take to long to build

cons
- the drum does not tilt all the way

But the rest of it is real great. You may think that the builder is not very good but it is; you will see.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"United_Bricks","2009-11-17T14:47:53.28Z","Excellent","This set is excellent it is good for young builders and old. I would give this set a five out of five because it is good if you are building a construction site.
I got this set when it first came out. It is good if you just got some pocket money. I liked the minifigure because he has good detail.
I especially like how if you turn the wheel piece the drum of the mixer will turn side to side.
You get grey studs what you put in the mixer.
This set is very good value for your money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legofan3810","2010-02-12T21:57:14.047Z","Builder","This set is pretty OK. The figure is particularly regular, but that's fine with me. I got this set as a free gift from my first brick master. Now on to the Pros and Cons.

Pros
Nice figure
Cement Mixer really turns
Cool wheel thingy. 

Cons
Cement peices get lost easy

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model is a mini cement mixer, the&nbsp;mixer can turn because of the wheel at the&nbsp;end.</p>

"i_luv_lego","2016-11-26T22:28:53.767Z","nice","<p>I got this set in January this year i found it to be very good, here is my review on it.</p>

<p>Lets start with the minifig,&nbsp;so the minifig in this set is just a generic builder with a red hat orange uniform wearing dark blue grey gloves, his face show that he is very hard working and happy towards his job.</p>

<p>The build.&nbsp;I think the build is very simple for what features the set has</p>

<p>So the main part of the set is quite realistic as when you move the cement mixer the drum spins around this is quite realistic to the real thing, also you notice that there is a wheel&nbsp;that you can turn to let the cement fall out, the cement is is 3 dark blue grey round pieces.</p>

<p>Praise</p>

<p>-the cement mixer is realistic</p>

<p>-the minifig is nice</p>

<p>-nice play features</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>-should have a shovel for the builder to pick up the cement</p>

<p>Overall 9/10</p>

<p>I hope this review was helpful&nbsp;:)</p>
