I like the trash can, the simple dumpster to throw away the &quot;trash&quot; and the price can't be beat. He works well with the city construction crew members. Good value and a nice addition to any collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-12-07T11:05:43.06Z","Keep your city clean","This set is a impulse set of the city theme and was released in the first season of this year. As all the other impulse sets, this set is cheap and have a considerable number of pieces and price per piece.

This set has 31 pieces (very good for a impulse, seeing that some have 16 or 21 pieces only), whcich makes this good to your collection or just to add more stuff on your city layout.

The contents are very useful to many other things, and the color scheme is nice, being also compatible with the color scheme of the set 7991 (recycle truck).

As a Impulse set, the building involved isn't complex, it is way too easy, but the result is good in this case. To build the container you have only to connect 11 pieces (the building includes 2 plates 2X4; 3 bricks 4X1; 2 slope bricks 2X1; a white plate 2X1 with a handle on side, and a black &quot;flag&quot; 2X2 square piece).

The set includes also a garbage can and a small cart which the minifig carries. As the set instructions indicates, the small cart (&quot;wheelbarrow&quot;) can carry the can above it.
Another useful content included is the minifigure.

The playability is average, isn't very complex (with additional functions, but the contents makes it a nice set to add on your city layout. It currently costs aprox. 3,50 US dollars (USA) and 2,00 GB Pounds (UK), but the price variates. Anyway, this set is cheap, and as a Impulse set, I recommend to the collectors who wants to make their city layouts bigger and more complex, buy one or more. 

This is overall, one of the best impulse sets from this year. A four out of five.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"_obelix_","2008-12-02T02:02:33.043Z","Fantastic!","I find this a fantastic little set. For its prce its got everything a nicely painted minifig, a trash can, very clever dumpster, a shovel as an accessory and a non-standard wheelbarrow for transporting just about anything in this set. It is a great addition to any city, as well as any other collection. There isn't a thing i dislike about this little set.

"lotographia","2009-03-21T23:25:56.28Z","The worker actually has a degree in astrophysics. What else was he going to do with life?","The one thing that prevented me from buying this set for a long time was that the trolley didn't look like it would be very good at containing the little pebbles. It seemed completely pointless. However, in the instructions the trolley is actually for carrying the trash can around. This makes MUCH more sense, and makes me rather more comfortable with the set.

I wasn't sure what the orange container was for, though. Another, less portable bin for trash? In the end I've decided that it's for bottle recycling, maybe for all the bottles that come with the service station.

The objects in this set are very much open to interpretation.

A good buy, though, with probably the largest piece count for this price point, and even something that the tiny cement mixer should also have come with - a shovel!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"alva","2011-03-02T01:08:35.563Z","Nice Design Impulse","Comparing this set with other impulse that coming out in the same year, this set is lack on the side of unique/special part. While the other impulse is very royal giving you animals or some minifig accessories, etc, this set only gives you some bricks and plates to play with.<br><br>But don't get me wrong. I think this set is among the best impulse coming out in the 2008. Eventhough it only contains regular bricks and plates, I think this set is more about the spirit of Lego itself. To build and use our imagination to create something new.<br><br>The design of the cart and the dumpster is really nice. It teach me that even though I only have small number of regular parts, I still can create something as long as I can use my imagination.<br><br>Really nice impulse and you should get one.<br><br>As a bonus, the trash can will look really nice and making your city more alive and real.<br>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4
"Boidoh","2009-12-06T15:18:50.717Z","Not So Great","I really dont like this set as MUCH. The cart is ugly and the studs usually drop out. The only extra piece i got is a extra garbage can lid. 

Pros-
1. Cool Construction like minifigure
2. He has a pen in his pocket
3. Cool Garbage can and Garbage dump.

Cons-
1. Only 1 extra piece
2. no banana peel or garbage only grey studs as garbage
3.  the pen in the minifigs pocket is painted on. atlest make a real pen.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Jito","2009-12-05T11:04:03.75Z","Good little set","I bought this little set twice because I wanted to have some more trash cans and dumpsters for my city. I think it's a real nice addition if you want it for that. Also I think the price is OK.

Pros:
-Garbage can and dumpster make great addition for your city
-Garbage men
-No stickers

Cons:
-Not a big con but the cart you get isn't really a great addition

"AETerry","2011-09-03T20:52:19.79Z","Public Works Review","I recently picked this up in the mail probably for a dollar more then I should have and then double that easily with the S&amp;H I shelled out on top of that. Still it's good to be able to ""back track"" and snag up a smaller set from earlier that I missed but still wanted for my collection.<br><br>Otherwise, small impulse sets like these should be picked up when they're available on the shelves. These small sets are also perfect for filling out City scenes. <br><br>As this is a small build, I'm not expecting anything over the top or a wow factor. You've very simply got a minifigure who's your Sanitation Engineer, a.k.a. Garbage Man with a shovel for scooping garbage and a trolley he pulls behind him with a trashcan on it. Plus there's a larger bin for dumping all of the garbage (grey 1x1 round plates) into.<br><br>In the mean time, til a LEGO Garbage truck comes around (that doesn't have Lotso in it), this little set will have to do for adding character to my LEGO City collection.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5

Reminds me of the small pocket money sets in the 1980's my Mum or Dad bought me.<div><br></div><div>I bought it today for Â£3.50 at The Entertainer as it goes extremely well with 2008's 7991 Refuse Truck.

"av8r1973","2011-02-12T01:53:20.107Z","Decent set for the price, adds nice detail to the city layout","For a tiny little set, this one really hit the spot. &nbsp;Yes, there are recycle trucks and several sets come with trash cans, but the addition of a dumpster and the cleanup worker goes well in either the city, the suburbs or the construction scene.<div><br></div><div>My 3yo daughter built this in about 10 minutes with no problem. &nbsp;She was disappointed there weren't any stickers, but I wasn't. &nbsp;:)</div><div><br></div><div>There are a couple of drawbacks that lower the playability a bit. &nbsp;First, the handcart is open on the bottom end. The use of the L-shaped pieces to make the sides of the cart was ok, but the one on the bottom allows the trash (little grey studs) to fall out. &nbsp;Second, the top of the trash can pops off. &nbsp;This is a problem across the LEGO sets, so it's not specific to this one. &nbsp;As other reviewers mentioned, ""real"" trash would have been nice. &nbsp;A newspaper, fruit or fish would have been good instead of the studs.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this little set adds some great detail to an otherwise building/vehicle-centric city layout and I will likely find a few more of them.</div>",TRUE,5,3,3,3,5

All you really get is a mini-fig, a dumpster, a trash can, and a wheelbarrow, but that's all you need! It's yet another thing that any real city would have and it can fit almost any City set by simply placing the dumpster along side it or around back.
