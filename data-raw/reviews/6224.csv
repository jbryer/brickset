I'm one of those people who doesn't like constantly removing the figures from their vechiles so a set like this is EXTREMELY handy.

"brickbuilder711","2007-12-22T13:09:37.763Z","Nice Addition to Your LEGO City!","I must say that Impulse sets were a great decision for LEGO. This one is one of my favorite Impulse Sets because it includes a sign piece not seen in recent sets except for the advent Calendars, and also because of the radar gun and the dog. If you want the sign piece, you might as well get a few copies so you can scatter them around your LEGO City. At $3.49, this is a great deal.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I like the little Lego sets with, say, just a very basic vehicle and a minifig. Those ones tend to be great value. This one is not great value, and I think most purchasers are likely to be surprised by how little is in the box. On the other hand, you get a dog!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"legofan5445","2008-03-16T10:53:05.577Z","Great Value !","This is a great impulse set ! IMHO, the best impulse set in 2008!

Cool Police Dude with a real nice face ! 
Dog ! Hard to find !
Speed Radar - Exclusive to this set, i think, do correct me if i'm wrong..
Speed Sign ! - havent seen this in a LONG time !

Cons:

Don't really understand the walkie talkie &amp; hand Signal Holder.. Kinda Wierd..

"Loganwan","2008-03-01T02:55:42.36Z","Some good stuff","This set has some good things for your Lego city, and for $3.50, you get some pretty neat accessories.  The first thing I noticed about the set is the great expression on the face of the officer.  With this set, he looks to be running a speed trap, and he is not too happy about what he is seeing.

You get a dog, which is great in my book since it looks just like my real dog, so that was a neat surprise.  You also get a walkie-talkie, and a blue light wand thing that I have never understood.

The final part is the speed limit sign and the radar detector.  The detector looks high tech, but the police officer in set  7236: Police Car also has a radar detector, and his has a little computer system to go with it.  I think the two could be combined to make a really good safe driving campaign in your Lego city.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It is a big dog when you compare it to the minifig which is nice because police K9s are always big. The radar gun is simple and good for catching speeders. This is a pretty good set and great for town fans to pick up.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"asianlego","2008-09-25T08:48:28.623Z","Please pull over your vehicle now!","The policeman is wearing his usual outfit except that he has that 'Officer Grumpypants' face. The rest of the set is really an organizer and a speedtrap. The speedtrap has an acceleration scanner mounted and also the speed limit sigh is printed, rather than stickers which are a great relief. The policeman comes with two blue beacons and a radio walkie talkie. Also present with the policeman is a brown dog which was nice because I've never had a Lego dog before. I think this set is nicely designed albeit very basic as you can simply prop it up anywhere beside roadplates and still look nice without modification!

"_obelix_","2009-01-09T12:32:58.903Z","Small policemen - great set","This years police force is indeed a very good theme that there really is no set within it that can say otherwise. This one is no exception. A cool grumpy face officer, a dog, radar and equipment stand, and a speed sign all point to a truly great set. I feared that it would have a sticker, which would have reduced this sets overall score. But, it didn't, to my great joy. A truly awesome set.

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-28T11:22:15.487Z","Speeders will be Prosecuted","<p>Set #5612 Police Officer: An impulse set from a couple of years ago, the Police Officer was in abundance for the longest time. (Oddly enough I never saw some of the Impulse sets from the early years when they first started with them at retail.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This little set cost 4.99$ at retail, in Canada at any rate. And it was everywhere, you could find this one the most prominent compared to the Firefighter set or any of the Castle ones and I don't see why. It was a cheap way to get not only a Police Mini-Figure, but the new LEGO dog and made for a nice little addition to any LEGO City display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You build a speed trap, a little utility stand to hold the officer's walkie talkie and traffic directing stick and that's pretty much it. But the impulse sets are not about building they're about collecting cheap Mini-Figures with a few accessories. (I suspect LEGO may choose to phase these out if the Collectible Mini-Figures really take off, and since they're impossible to find in stores I think it's safe to assume they've taken off.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set rates 4/5 for me because it was my first LEGO dog, a neat little set and a great way to bulk up my collection until I can afford the more expensive Police sets. If you can still find it in stores or even get it in a lot on E-Bay I'd say he's worth having. Although you have to wonder just how far off the beaten path he's stationed if he has a dog to protect him from the nasty speeders, but no pistol or other weapon. (Do LEGO Police even use guns though? I don't think so.)</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,4
"coldcomfort","2011-01-08T04:04:31.68Z","5621 Police Officer - A superlative minifigure impulse set.","<p>First of all, I have to point out that my ratings of sets are subjective based on what I believe the overall intent of the set to be. For example, my expectations of $100 USD+ major sets are much higher and more detailed than my expectations for middle price point and inexpensive impulse sets. With that in mind, my view towards sets like these is that they are marketed to provide Lego enthusiasts with an inexpensive avenue of adding 1) minifigures, 2) minifigure accessories, and 3) an assortment of basic bricks and elements to their collections. I also keep my expectations of the building experience in context. We're only buying a minifigure here, after all. We can't honestly expect a challenge. I keep only those criteria in mind when reviewing sets like this one.</p><p>Flat out, this is an excellent impulse set. It meets the criteria I've outlined and then exceeds them. The accessories included in this kit add real depth to a City layout and go a long way to enhancing playability. On top of all of that, you just can't beat the price. I never see impulse kits like this for sale in my local retail outlets and as a result must buy them on the secondary market. Even at that, I see no problem with paying $6 or $7 USD for a set like this.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The focus of the set and the reason everyone buys it in the first place, the police officer minifigure.<br></li><li>The speed trap accessories in this kit (including 50kmph Euro styled speed sign, sign post, traffic camera and mounting bracket) give it a real purpose within the City theme and suggest a story as soon as one opens the box. <br></li><li>The new dog is included in this kit, and I view it as an absolute bonus considering that I feel that this set is worth the price even without it.</li><li>A nice handful of basic bricks and elements are included. On top of this, I received a total of seven extra pieces with my box, one of which was the officer's hand held traffic signal.</li><li>This kit really does give you quite a lot for a little bit of money.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons NONE!<br></h4>This kit is the best example yet that I have seen of what an impulse set should be. It delivers everything I expect from a minifigure box and then gives even more. The fact that the accessories come together to suggest a play premise shows that Lego is really making an effort to keep their products - even the least expensive of them - fun and interesting. If you like the City theme you should definitely pick up at least one of these as soon as you can.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
