"Stash","2007-12-20T12:06:19.077Z","The new &quot;impulse sets&quot; are absolutely great and the price is perfect! The firefighter is no exception.","I really love these new &quot;impulse sets&quot; that they are putting out in 2008 (I got the term from the cashier at the lego outlet. He made the comment that they are a great idea and are selling really well, and I have to agree). They are like very tiny army builder sets that help to expand your forces that come with excellent extra bits as well. 

The mini-fig:

The fireman is very nice, and has a non-standard head as well as a hard-hat accessory. The only thing that could make him any better would be an oxygen tank and/or printed arms/legs/back (I think it makes the mini-figs exponentially better). 

The tool rack:

Very hard to complain about anything here. You get 4 different accessories with the set including 2 different saws (one blade and one buzz-saw), an axe, and a fire extinguisher. The saw blade is a great piece (not all that common and useful for different mods) but I am not sure what you are supposed to do with it in the context of this set. I like that they included it vs. not including it however and it can surely be useful when combined with other sets. If one of the saw-blade mounts had been included it would be even better. There is an empty slot on the rack where it could be held. 

There is a small addition next to the tool rack whose purpose I am unsure of, but you could stand the fire extinguisher on top of it if you wanted. Again, extra bits are never a bad thing.

Other:

You get a flame piece with a stand to give the firefighter something to do, and more flame pieces are always great to have. The tool stand is well formed and can be added on to the bigger firestation set or used for bits.

Overall, I would say this set is fairly perfect, and anything that I thought should or could be added is really only refining something that is great on its own. For the low price of 3.50 (which the lego store used to charge for a mini-fig with one accessory and hat anyway) I don't see how anyone could not like this set or type of set. It is the perfect way to make your individual sets just a little bigger (or a lot bigger if you want to buy several) and I really hope that lego continues to make these tiny impulse sets.

I have already picked up the small bulldozer set, the castle knight, and the jet engine maintenance technician sets as well (4.00, 3.50, and 3.50 respectively; also great sets). I know there is a policeman available in addition to these, and probably a few others too that I will check for when I go back to the lego outlet. Some have not been released yet (like the castle wizard).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"bmwlego","2008-06-17T13:52:01.67Z","Firefighter to the Rescue!","Great set for a minifig set. Scores of tools (fire extinguisher, circular saw, axe, saw, fire hydrant and fire). The simple fire hydrant can be built easily so you can place them throughout your city scenes. Why can't LEGO make a dalmatian for the fire house? That would have been an awesome addition to this set, much like the police officer has his dog. 5 out of 5. Great idea by LEGO to create these Impulse sets.

The fireman is very common so I don't really wow over him. The tools rack is very superbly done and there is even a fire hydrant beside it, although its very very simple. A tiny flame scene is also included. The selection of tools for the fireman is nice and there are two axes, two fire extinguishers, a buzz saw, and a chainsaw. However this set would serve nicely if you own a fire station.

In my opinion it doesn't really add much to the allready huge amount of fire brigade sets lego produced. For € 1,- it's a good deal, but given the price the LEGO company askes for it I give it a 4/10 rating.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-28T11:30:25.717Z","Firefighting Training Class","<p>Set #5613 Firefighter: Impulse sets interest me not only as a Semi-Completist (which is an insane type of collector to be with LEGO themes.) but because they offer up many opportunities to gain Mini-Figures when you're on a shoestring budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set comes with three things, a buildable Firefighting Equipment stand, a buildable fire to put out and the Firefighter. I think this set is meant to represent a training exercise for the Firefighter, since they have to be quick to handle any emergency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tools he comes with are nice too, he's got an axe, a fire extinguisher, a fire hydrant a hand saw for cutting someone out of a car after a traffic accident (or dealing with fallen trees in the middle of the road.) and for some reason something that kind of looks like part of a chain-saw. (Guess he has to cut through fallen trees by hand if he runs out of juice for the other cutting implement.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this is a nice set to pick up and play with if you're in the mood for LEGO, but (like me) can't afford to get a more expensive set. (Unfortunately by now your only chance of finding this set is on E-Bay or through sites that specialize in selling older LEGO sets.)</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"coldcomfort","2011-01-08T04:29:12.5Z","5613 Firefighter - Another minifigure impulse set that's right on the money.","First of all, I have to point out that my ratings of sets are subjective
 based on what I believe the overall intent of the set to be. For 
example, my expectations of $100 USD+ major sets are much higher and 
more detailed than my expectations for middle price point and 
inexpensive impulse sets. With that in mind, my view towards sets like 
these is that they are marketed to provide Lego enthusiasts with an 
inexpensive avenue of adding 1) minifigures, 2) minifigure accessories, 
and 3) an assortment of basic bricks and elements to their collections. I
 also keep my expectations of the building experience in context. We're 
only buying a minifigure here, after all. We can't honestly expect a 
challenge. I keep only those criteria in mind when reviewing sets like 
this one.<br><br>This set is exactly what I want from a baseline impulse set. It delivers another very cool firefighter to help protect your City (and I really enjoy this one because it just happens to be a dead ringer for my brother), a handful of really great accessories and a small pile of useful basic bricks and elements - all of this at a price that can't be argued with.<br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>This set hits all of my requirements perfectly and delivers everything I want from a minifigure set.<br></li><li>The accessories are excellent. You receive a fireman's axe, a jaws-of-life-styled chainsaw, a circular saw, a fire extinguisher and a very cool little fire hydrant made from a few 1x pieces. You even get a little fire to put out. I guess my imagination has atrophied a bit since I was a kid because it never occurred to me to put those pieces together to make a fire hydrant even though they make a spot on likeness.<br></li><li>Once again, this set delivers an excellent value. When you really think about what you're getting (even without the few extra pieces that are always thrown in for good measure) you can't go wrong for the money. If you added up the cost of buying the minifig on its own and then buying the remaining pieces on Pick a Brick you'd be well beyond the price most of us pay for this kit.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No cons whatsoever.<br></li></ul>
<p>Despite the fact that my primary interest in Lego is the building experience, these small impulse kits are quickly growing on me. You get so much in such a tiny package. I consider them to be a tremendous value and great fun. In fact, I think that from here on out I will put at least one in each of my nieces' and nephews' Christmas stockings. If you enjoy the City theme you will certainly make good use of this set. I highly recommend that you buy at least one.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>On the front of the box it shows the set in full detail: A firefighter and his rescuing tools.<br>This is good, because then you can see exactly what you are getting.<br>The instructions are folded up into a tiny square, there are no mistakes in the building steps.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4>The parts are good for a set this small, chainsaw, disccutter, an axe and a fire extinguisher.<br>You also get a fire element which is good, because this adds playability to the set, rather than just pretending there is a fire element. <br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>The minifigure is a standard firefighter, with a white helmet. It has the firemans printing, and a face which is becoming regular in non-Fire sets.<br>
<h4>The build</h4>The build needs no skill to complete it, it takes 10 seconds to build, and it is very strong too, so unlike other brands of LEGO, it won´t fall apart as you are building it.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4>The completed model looks awesome, but it is easy to knock over, I can blow it over(!) but nonetheless still good.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4>All in all it is a good set, worth getting to enlarge your LEGO City/Fire collection. 4/5.<br><br>LEGOSLUG<br><br>P.S. Please see and rate my other reviews and bricklists.<br><br>",TRUE,4,5,1,4,3
"Minifig290","2018-02-14T23:53:45.203Z","Small Great City Set","<p>This is my first Throwback Thursday so i thought i&#39;d review one of my oldest sets i own the 5613 Firefighter set, this set was released in 2008 and retailed for &pound;3 or $4. It comes with 25 parts meaning the price per part is 9.8p or 14c</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The firefighter is the only figure in this set and it isn&#39;t anything to amazing but is always nice to get a figure in a cheap set, definitely seen as a blind bag costs &pound;3 or $4 the same price as this.The face, torso and legs aren&#39;t anything to exciting but the hat is a cool piece to get (for me anyway).</p>

<p><b>Build</b></p>

<p>There are a total of two builds, the main build is a rack that holds some firefighting gear: a chainsaw, Disk saw and an axe with a spare place to put other tools. There is also a flame build which uses only 3 pieces and isn&#39;t to exciting at all.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To sum up this review this set was worth the &pound;3 price and is still worth getting now if you can find it for a reasonable price. The rack could be used in other scene like in a garage and has some useful parts for it time like the saws. If this set was released now days it would retail for &pound;5 which i wouldn&#39;t mind paying.</p>

<p><strong>Pros- </strong>Great main build and tools included and a decent figure</p>

<p><strong>Cons-</strong> The flame isn&#39;t anything exciting</p>
