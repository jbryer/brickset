"lordofdragonss","2007-12-29T10:27:43.39Z","My First Review!","I think this cool impulsive sets wouldn't come to Poland.Sadly.
I love the colors and prints on Wizards torso and cap.

Pros:
New wizard!
Owl
Crystal Ball

Cons:
Where is a starshape wand?

So -5/5 for the wand. I hope lego make a smal set with the bad wizzie too.

"STK","2008-01-19T18:21:08.763Z","The Good one","I like the new line of the Impulse sets and cant wait for the upcoming ones.

Good:
- A good wizard, who can fight the bad one
- the printing on his hat and legs
- the owl
- the magic wand (i dont like much the fairytale looking of Cerlin or Willa)
- nice little table
- jewel &amp; crystalball

Not so good:
- some kind of expensive
- the torso is not printed, its only sand(?) blue",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-03-17T08:37:47.86Z","WIZARD!","Well, as an impulse, this set has done its job (attract hose who haven't know about LEGO) very well. I was used to like EXO-FORCE, but I turn my back since I know about the discontinue of it and began searching for another unique theme. I buy this set with a 10% discount on my local toystore. This set is impressive. The bird were nothing, although it's still unique. The glass globe was cool, with a yellow-colored jewel in it. Most of all, the wizard. His appearance is very attracting, mostly the hat and the beard. This set also has a lot of playability. Great set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-18T14:04:36.013Z","Impulse: The Good Wizard","This set is another set from the Castle new sets and also a impulse set. Like all the other Impulse, the set have few pieces and is so small. It have some useful pieces like the crystal ball, but 16 pieces are really few. The minifigure included is different from some of the new castle sets and also different from the old wizards on the classic castle sets. This minifigure is good designed but not like the old wizard minifigure. This have a gray cool color, but stars on his hat makes it is silly, like the name good wizard, because the story is made by the owner of the set. The staff is small and with no new features. The owl minifigure is nice detailed but with bad color differences, is completely white. This set is basic, and with really few pieces and so much easy building, that makes it be boring. The useful pieces are few and bad builted in this set. The figure have a cool color but the simple design of the old wizard minifigure in the classic castle is much better. Finally, i say again that the 16 few pieces are bad used in this set. So, i rate the Impulse and Castle set &quot;The Good Wizard&quot; 3/5",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"mike2008","2008-03-15T01:55:31.75Z","The good wizard. An essential part from every army.","The good wizard set is a small set with a great price tag (wish I had 2 of them).
Let’s start with the minifig: The wizard looks great, but his torso is unpainted. This is ok as long as the wizard got his beard. 

The wizard's wand is great, not like the fairy tale type wand found in the earlier castle sets. 
The only draw back to the set is the lack of base. 
Even a 4x4 base would add a lot to the set. 

My rate is 4.5 out of 5.

Considering that I wanted to have at least one set of this theme and I love minifigures and this one was a good addition to my collection of almost 500 minifigures.
The set is basic only 16 pieces, a very cool minifigure, a table with a crystal ball and another table with an owl

"legoguysw","2008-06-02T13:48:11.187Z","A nice addition to any Lego castle","I got this from LegoLand Windsor, and its my first ever castle set! Anyway, the review:
MINIFGS
Like all Impulse sets, this set includes 1 minifig, a wizard. Yay! He has a nice hat, and a beard, and nice PRINTED legs. You don't see many of those. His torso is plain, which is fine cause of the beard blocking it. Did I mention the beard yet? I love it! You don't see many of those, either. He also has a brown stick, or staff
FURNITURE
This wizard has a crystal ball. It has a crystal inside it, no surprise there. The part that makes up the 'ball' in 'crystal ball' is cool, It fits the part well. I think I have to say that it is does fit over a minifig head, sort of.
The wizard also has a shelf thing, which his nice owl sits on. Nothing more to say there.
Throw in an potion or 2, and this set will be BRILLIANT. For now, its just good, but still a 5. Lego fans, get one. Castle fans, get multiples!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"greenfrog_7","2008-05-09T02:05:33.39Z","Good Wizard... not Great","The Good Wizard set is obviously quite small and to be honest I only picked it up to fill up my collection as it currently stands. The set is really not that attractive as a counterpart to the evil wizard packaged with the Skeleton Tower set. I don't think I'm the only one disappointed with the diminutive excuse for a wand included here. However, everything is there as advertised, so you can't really be too surprised.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

PRO
- New wizard, with far higher detail than original 1993 wizard. Softer colouring
- Cristal ball, simple but good design of table
- Owl and stand make nice addition

CON
- Staff, as said by others, is unimaginative",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"allencao3","2008-12-10T21:43:56.81Z","Where is the robe?","How could the crownies possibly win the battle against mighty creatures like dragons without a wizard? And that’s why this set appeared on my shopping list. It is still kinda weird to me why the wizard came in an impulse set though. I guess nobody would buy a whole bunch of wizards under any circumstances… But it is still good for castle fans, price wise.

It IS really a small set so I don’t have much to say just a couple of points, mainly things that I am not satisfied about
- ROBE!! The wizard looks lame without a robe or a cape for the necromancer would do too.
- I am personally not a fan of the grayish blue color.  Maybe he will be upgraded to a white wizard later like Gandalf?
- There could have been a nicer staff too.
- The white owl is a nice idea but cannot be recognized from a distance.
- The color scheme of the crystal ball and the table is not that good.

I probably should not be too harsh on such a teeny set. But there are certain improvements that could be made. Like it or not, a castle fan would still buy this anyway.

"the_lead_general","2008-11-23T18:11:38.187Z","Nice set","This is a small set so I will only write a small review
 
Plus+
     The table with the crystal ball is great and looks authentic. The addition of the owl is a great idea though it could come with a potion rack. The wizards hat is great and the rest of him is not lacking. 

Minus-
      He could have a more imaginative staff like the dark wizards or a potion rack.

Equals=
       A nice impulse set for add-ons to a castle, not very good by it's self.

Compatibility
             To get the best out of this set buy a set with a tall tower, preferably Kings castle siege or tower raid.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Lint","2010-01-22T21:58:22.28Z","SET DOES NOT PASS!","Forgive my corny joke of a title

I held off on getting this until they were almost off the shelves because it didn't look like great value compared to the other impulses. Ultimately I was right.

PROS
-The wizard hat really is very very nice
-Beard, nicely sculpted
-Crystal ball, I suppose

CONS
-Not a lot of pieces overall
-Nonsense play value
-Wand/Staff is very lame compared to the ones other castle mages have (i.e evil wizard, troll sorceress and even the classic castle wizard)
-Poor value compared to other impulses.

Overall the hat would be the only reason I would consider buying this set again. You are better off getting something else.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
