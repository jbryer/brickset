"legobear","2007-12-13T06:38:08.56Z","For Castle Fans","I am a fan of small sets, however, some LEGO forum members have voiced their dislike at the price per piece disparity. Having said that, I do like this small set because it gives those new to LEGO the basic equipment a knight truly needs: sword, spear, two helmets, shield, armor, and an arm's rack.  Small sets are always fun, this set is no exception =)  

Pros:
*Fully armored.
Rare metallic chest plate.
Rare metallic helmet found in more expensive sets.
The only '07 castle set as of Dec '07 to have this new printed torso.

Cons:
$3.49 is expensive for the piece count.
Pieces here can be founded on BrinkLink for cheaper.
The only '07 castle set as of Dec '07 to have this printed torso.

By assembling all of 8 in my possession, I say, it is great for arms-buildup.  But it costs a bit too much, I expect US$2 to US$3.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-02-28T06:32:43.263Z","Weapons Galore!","Bought this set the other day when I went shopping for birthday presents and decided to get something small for myself. This set is definitely an impulse set or as I call them “keeps the children quiet” set.

The set contains 21 pieces making it a bit rich for piece to price ratio but it doesn't make it any less of a good set. It comes with a mini-fig, a weapons rack and a fair few weapons. The rack is something I have been wanting in a set since I was a small child. Having a great love affair with weapons I was always making shelves and bits for my figs to keep their weapons on, this is what I was looking for.

The fig is a soldier dressed in light grey pants, light and dark blue shirt with a crown in the middle and a face that isn't very happy. He has two helmets one being open face with a nosepiece and the other being a full face with bars. He also has full torso armour and shield, that's design matches his shirt. His two weapons are a sword and a spear.

Overall I really love this set and think it is perfect for someone who is trying to build an army and want their warriors to come with a full arsenal of gear. Aesthetically it looks good but has very limited playability. I love the instructions as they are so clear and give a number to each part, the future of our catalogue system. I feel this model is a solid 5/10 for a little model and would recommend it to anyone who likes the castle series, loves weapons or wants to build an army.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Da_LegoBuilder","2008-02-08T20:39:02.107Z","its not bad, but not good either..","This set has everything what a good knight should have, spear, helmet, sword, armor, and shield. At least they got the basics down, should have come with a horse! They made this set smartlyish, has everything a knight should have ready for battle! I somehow like the castle theme for some reason... and it is at an extremely low price!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Stash","2008-01-08T09:48:53.967Z","Despite a higher price/parts ratio, the accessories compensate very well.","I'll start out by saying that I love the new impulse sets, and I plan on buying at least one of each. They all offer great piece selections for a price (3.50 US up to 6-8 USD). At 7 or 8 dollars it perhaps becomes less of an impulse set. The Doctor's Car set that just came out falls into this category, being much more expensive for a low piece count than it should be. I feel that THOSE are the sets that deserve such negative talk for price/piece count ratios (that being said I also really like the doctor's car set). 

Here, we have a knight with a stocked armor rack. I think that the reason that the price/piece ratio is higher than the 10 cents/piece border is the high amount of non-standard pieces included( I find anything under or up to .10/piece average to be fine if there is a nice selection of rare/non generic pieces included; if there are a large number of minifigs a higher price/part ratio is fine to me as well).

Mini-Fig:

The knight you get has a new torso, as mentioned before, and is for now the only one that has it in the new Castle collection (though I am sure this will change). He does not leave much to be desired, coming with a full set of armor including 2 alternate pieces (extra helmet and spear/sword). The face does not stand out much but is still different from a generic minifig head with a slight sneer/scarred lip area and larger eyes.

Accessories:

A full complement of equipment comes with the set. You get a sword, a spear, armor, a shield, and 2 helmets. This allows for an extra helmet and weapon to be used with other figures you have. The high accessory count makes this set very worthwhile since you can never have too many. 

Weapon Rack:

Not much to say here. It is plain, but functional. There are not enough holders for all the accessories, so either a weapon or the shield cannot be held on the rack. That could have been improved with just one more piece, but isn't anything to really complain over. 

Overall, a great little set to buff your army with and the price is right in my opinion. Not sure how much more you could really ask for out of a tiny cheap set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set is like the other impulse, a small set with few pieces. The knight minifigure is one of the most used in the new lego themes and comparison with the other castle new sets, this minifigure have no much changes. The two helmets and also the armor, sword and spear are silver colored, that makes a good effect. The basic green plate and the few brown pieces are useful and good builted to guard the weapons or armors. This set is useful, playable and with a cheap price, but it have no new things or a different effect from the castle sets, and also have really few pieces, only 21, just small.

You just pop off the hat or red helmet, at the visored helm and chest piece and there you go!! Another knight that doesn't look too bad at all. All in all a good buy mostly because the short sword is back at the shields look good as well.

"allencao3","2008-12-03T23:12:38.937Z","Hate the printing on the torso! But still bought a lot of those.","I still don’t understand why LEGO chose to have a new printing on crownies in the first place. Can’t really see any reasoning behind this. The new printing looks cheap as though the crownies cannot afford to forge any armor this year! Financial crisis in their world too? lol

I really cannot stand the printing so never did I take the silver breastplates and the barred helmets (which are simply gorgeous) off them. They are now serving the kingdom as heavy infantries! Plenty of weapons included and a shield! LEGO is not very generous on the number of shields in other sets and now you can have a lot of thme.

Nothing else to say about such a small set. If you want more infantries (heavy infantries in my case), this is what you want!

"the_lead_general","2008-11-23T20:59:00.28Z","Nice set","The knight
 
Plus+
     Great number of weapons for such a small set. The new top is good for special troops like pike-men, royal guards and javalineers. The rack is very good for holding what is required because he would always wear a helmet and carry a weapon, if not most of the available ones.

Minus-
      The rack is way too big and in real life a rack would be much smaller, but in Lego they can't make one better. The shield could be the large one but that may enlarge the rack again. Also the breast-plate could have decorations on it.

Equals=
       Another great small set with a large amount of critical stuff like weapons, men or value for money.

Compatibility
             This set is good for adding better weapons to a fighting force or army but you can have too many. They take up too much room, but if you have 4 at the castle, one at the dock, one at the dwarves mine, one at tower raid etc. Youll have lots but it is not noticable. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>This is a great impulse set and a good buy. The minifig is equipped with a silver helm and spear, which I guess are used in peacetime, and another set of armor to answer the call to arms. And either could be stowed away in the nifty storage rack.

So that leaves you with just the brown, round brick. I can imagine arranging these racks and putting the&nbsp;extra pieces so you could have a complete armory. And the sword, of course, is made of pliable plastic, so do be careful fitting this in.</p>
