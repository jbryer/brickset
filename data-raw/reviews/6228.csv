"Rgijaba","2008-02-05T19:27:49.86Z","small set, BIG fun!","this is one of those minis LEGO released this year, and it took me a while to find one in a store... but i fornd one in King Aurther's Court (a locle toy store in our town)!its a great mini, and comes with a lota things for its sise (the price is a bit high; it should be $2.99...) it comes with: astro pilot (shouln't it come with miner...?), a mini robot, and lots of tools! sadly, theyre part of the mini robot... so we cant use them! but WHO cares?! we have a robot box that can hold, like, seven energy crystles (that i like)!to wrap up this review thats a bit long for a set this sise, i must note the gun, MARS MISSION GUNS DONT LOOK LIKE THAT! they ARE megahones, but with a lightsaber bas piece with a blue cone on one end! mabye its mission commander's private blaster...? anyhoo, get the set if youre a mars mission fan  or want some rare parts!but DONT get it if you dont plan to get any other mars mission sets! why isnt mini robot in crystalienconflict?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-05-24T21:44:02.81Z","Nice Impulse","Well, this is a nice set, and it's cheap too. The robot isn't too great, but there is a slot for one crystal inside it. The best of all is the gold visor. It's very nice The pickaxe is quite rare too. 4/5 after all.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T14:01:25.92Z","Impulse: Mini-Robot","This is another little &quot;Impulse&quot; sets, little like the promotional. This includes a mini robot and an astronaut  minifigure made with 24 pieces, more than the other impulse. But this is bad builted, too simple and don't very playable. The colors aren't the coolest, but still good. The minifigure have nothing new, and the all set too. The green pieces were used in classic sets like the insectoids and ufo, more coolest than this line. But this is greater than the another impulse sets, of mars mission or castle because it, i rate this 5/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KDog","2008-02-24T22:21:33.7Z","Eat me some crystals! Munch!","This set proves that after 30 years, Lego still knows how to come up with creative designs for robots. The giant mouth on this robot is inspired, and I like how he &quot;eats&quot; the crystals the astronaut finds. The astronauts in Mars Mission are nice, a combination of the more realistic astronauts from the Space Port series and old Lego Space, since they have the original Space Agency logo on their suits. I am not fond, however, of how air tanks have been replaced with a printed apparatus on the minifig torsos.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legomarsfan","2008-08-17T04:47:32.187Z","many rare pieces","i bought this set for the rare pieces and they are a picaxe binougylars storage box and a detector tool overall its a nice impulse set and a great upgrade for every mars mission set except the the other MM impulse set the alien jet",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Obi_Wan9994","2008-08-27T09:42:47.123Z","Like it, not love it, but it deserves a 5.","When I was at the store recently I wanted a Lego set, but I didn't have much money, so I decided to get this one out of curiousity. I'll admit I'm not a fan of the large Mars Mission sets, but the smaller ones interest me. 

Pros:
Astronaut mini fig- cool, I'm not sure if all of the astronauts have the same face under the helmet or not.
Mini-Mining Robot- my favorite part, 2 movable arms and legs (arms can hold stuff), a body that can open and close and can hold things, and nice little details for eyes, etc.
Accesories- pick-axe, green gem, something that looks like a metal detector, and something that looks like a blaster from star wars, though I'm sure it's not.
Playability- not much playability by itself, but it's probably more fun with other Mars Mission sets.
Price- inexpensive, it's a good impulse

Whether you're into Mars Mission or not, this is worth getting. I give this a 5 due to it's price.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-13T13:09:26.34Z","Great for Parts and Minifig","This set being so small gave me many of my first parts even though I've been buying Legos for years. The small ore-detecting device, the pickaxe, the gold visor and my first astronaut minifig. If you weren't very thorough looking at the box, you might have thought that the robotic assistant is WALL-E. Except without caterpillar track wheels.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"travisco_nabisco","2008-12-31T18:46:35.03Z","Great Little Set","Overall I am not a fan of the Mars Mission sets, however when I got this one in my stocking I was very impressed.

The set provides a detailed mini figure with painting on his front and his back. The best part of this set is the little robot. It is made with very few pieces, but is an excellent design.

I also enjoy the fact that I got an extra 4 pieces in the set, including a third robot arm.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"nath8888","2010-10-18T20:13:00.46Z","Perfect to add more minifigs!","This is one of the best mars mission sets. In my opinion, there were 2 fantastic cheap ones, and this was one of them. This set contains 1 robot, one human operator, and a few tools. The robot is an ok design for playability, but a great design for animation and to create little robot mine-squadrons. The only thing that I wish that they had done with the robot is give it the exo-force robot arms, as they look a little more durable.&nbsp;<div>The minifigure is very straight forward. I really like the space-suit, but in a set as small as this, I would have liked for lego to have included an oxygen tank/backpack.</div>",FALSE,5,5,3,5,4
"Darthleapyous","2009-08-26T04:08:52.78Z","an OK set","this is a fairly good set.I got it from the supernova pop culture expo,here are the pros and cons:

pros:
robot
pick axe
gun
space guy

cons:
a bit two small even for a miniset

overall:
A fine set,get it if you wish.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bajadogq","2009-12-14T20:24:47.497Z","Little but flawless.","This small set includes an astronaut (with a blaster) and a box-shaped mining robot (with a pickax and crystal detector). Both the robot and the astronaut have the same orange-and-white color scheme as all the other Mars Mission Astronauts/ Astronaut Vehicles. The robot has a storage compartment for crystals. It looks simple yet high tech. The build is incredibly easy.

Pros:
- Minifigure
- Robot
- Color scheme
- Mining Gear

Cons:
- None

Mars Mission fans MUST pick this up if they have the chance.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Squidtron","2009-12-23T00:07:01.577Z","minirobot...","The Robot isn't really that ""mini"" compared to a minifig. Not much else to say.

now for the cool/not cool things about this set.
Nice Parts(+2)
Cute(+2)
Too Expensive(-2)
Robot can contain the Crystal(+1)
So it gets a 3/5 Average.

"patch","2010-03-26T14:46:12.653Z","It's a letter box with legs!","<p>This is a good little set with interesting parts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>mini robot has a place to store crystals, a pick axe, and an energy crystal detector</li>
    <li>arms move in and out on robot</li>
    <li>good price</li>
</ul>
<p>cons</p>
<ul>
    <li>I don't know why the astronaut has an alien gun, the 1x1 round transparent brick on the end should be blue, like all other lasers in the astronaut theme!</li>
</ul>
<p>overall, this is a great little set as a gift (it looks like WALL-E!) or to add to your collection. Just don't start your mars mission collection with this, though!</p>
<p>see you soon!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"alva","2011-02-27T19:55:30.847Z","The best Mars Mission Set","For me, this impulse is really the best designed Mars Mission set ever, not the big set. <br>Because it doesnt come with an alien minifig. <br>Man, how I hate those guys:P<br><br>I really love the space themed Lego set. My favourite one is the classic space and the Blacktron. I think, space theme should be about exploration, not fighting with some strange looking creature and aliens. And this little impulse is really representing it. <br>They have an astronout minifigure, and it owns a mining robot. The robot design is really a cool design. You put some common parts, and voila, you got a really cool robot. <br>Very thorough design if you ask me.<br><br>You can build a space mining camp and put some of these set around it.<br>I got mine for 40% off, and it really felt as a bargain for me.<br><br>My suggestion : grab one of this baby whenever you see one!<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"charliebucket","2016-06-13T01:17:53.403Z","a smallie but a goodie","<p>One of the smaller Mars Mission sets... but still, it&#39;s Mars Mission so it&#39;s awesome :)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is square and tiny. &nbsp;The instructions are on a leaflet with the guide on one side and ads for sets on the other. The only thing of note is that they tear easily, so store yours properly.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing of note for this. The binoculars, the pick, the megaphone/blaster, the power crystal&nbsp;and the metal detector are all good parts, although most people will already have a&nbsp;lot of them.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There is only one minifig with this set and it is the normal astronaut so, nothing special with him!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build will take&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;30 seconds to a minute&nbsp;for most people and there is no use of special techniques.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The robot looks, well, small to say the least,&nbsp;but having said that, it still looks good. &nbsp;I think it would work well as part of a&nbsp;big diorama rather than a stand alone model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>With 24 parts, 1 minifig and not much else you would expect that it would be quite poor for a retail set, but, Lego produced a well designed set for it&#39;s price. &nbsp;So well done them!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope this helped you&nbsp;choose your next Lego set :)&nbsp;</p>
