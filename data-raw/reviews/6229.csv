The pieces are useful, but still few and with not new features. The building of this alien jet is easy and is bad due to it. Also like the other mars mission sets, the jets or aliens ships does not have pieces like the old space lego themes, the alien ships looks like incompletes. This set includes a alien minifigure, but like all the other mars mission aliens, the color makes a weird effect and also the design or builting of the minifigure, not in the lego original style. This set looks like incomplete, with no new features and really few pieces. The minifigure is also also bad. But the set have a cheap price and some pieces are useful. So, i rate the Impulse/Mars Mission set &quot;Alien Jet&quot; 3/5",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"andy87","2008-12-02T06:43:48.45Z","Very skeliton-like","This is the only cheap way to get a quick alien ship, but unfortuanatly the design is just not worth it. If it looked more like the little sleek ship that comes with the switch fighter, it may have been better/ But this thing barely resembles any of the other alien ships.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-05T08:32:00.797Z","We are watching you, human!","The fact that they certainly did a lot with 21 pieces surprises me. The Alien Jet is superb! Sure, it may not be like what you expected (you did pay a small amount of money for this!) but the structure of the jet is simply splendid. The color scheme is great! To top it all off, they even give you two hinged pieces, the kind you use to split buildings into half. I was about to give this set a 5 but gave it a 4 instead because of the minifig. Never mind its weird looks, it is also designed badly. And it is also see-through. The hands are stuck fast to the sides of its body. There is even a hole through his chest! And there is no detail at all on the alien. Apart from that, you should try picking up this set, it's pretty good!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-28T15:52:28.997Z","glow in the dark?","Mine never glows in the dark bu then again nothing that used to glow the dark seem to any more, oh well. I like this set. The only con that i've spotted is tat the charactes doesn't seem to have any proper arms. The ship looks cool.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"P13c30fch33s3","2008-12-13T19:42:03.263Z","Small and nice...","This is a little small and weak, but still, I think that it is worth it.

Pros:
Cheap alien ship (most are quite expensive ships)
Neat gun swivelling
looks complete and sturdy

Cons:
Too Small
alien is a little 'cheap' or incompatible with most other sets
weak
fangs don't work as a harness

get a lot of these and you may have a lot of fun.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"merkinized75","2008-12-14T04:25:03.793Z","Nasty aliens!","I reviewed this set because i had nothing interesting to do. This set is good if you are an army builder. I am not like that. Just bought it when saw it. It has some missing features, or should i say cons. Etc. it would be more better if it came with crystals instead of those red studs on the ˝cabin˝. Those hinging guns are neat(more-sided defense). It looks like a spy scout flying pod. Overall a good set. I recommend it to army builders.

P.S. Alien is handless!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"alva","2011-02-27T19:47:46.52Z","Worst Impulse I Ever Have","What I really do not like about the set is the martian as minifig. It is really not represent what a Lego minifigure should be. It cast on one piece, meaning you can not move any part of it. The alien also have a hole in his chest, making it more unreal.<br>Yes,it is a glow-in-the-dark minifig, but I think Lego is not using their best resources when designing this minifig.<br><br>Maybe if you use the alien as a dead alien specimen, like in the 7694, MT-31 Trike, it still works. But having this one as a healthy alien driving around a spaceship, quite strange for me.<br><br>The shape of the plane is also bad. It's like giving some random part to a 3 years old kid and ask him to create a plane. The kid even probably can come up with a better design than this.<br><br>I bought mine for 50% discount after it collecting dust in store and no one want to buy it. And I still regret my purchase here.<br><br>So, my suggestion, avoid this set, just don't pick it up. Unless probably if you want to have a glow-in-the dark minifig.<br>",TRUE,2,1,1,1,2

"Sobel","2020-06-17T21:29:05.3Z","It's small, it's cheap, it's really not much.","<p>After having finished my first complete series review (check them out, if you like), I have made it some sort of a good routine for myself to review some sets of my collection in my free time. And with that and my deep passion for LEGO Space,&nbsp;I&#39;ll go on to review this space-themed series from the late 2000&#39;s.<br />
Let&#39;s start with this inconspicuous little set, that really has not much to it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>21 pieces, what do you expect?&nbsp;At least, the two green fang-like cockpit enclosures are worth mentioning.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One minifigure is included, a Martian pilot. First and foremost I have this statement to make: these&nbsp;alien minifigures SUCK. I mean, come ON!! Just two pieces of transparent plastic, no moveable arms, fixed legs with only one joint and a whole in the torso like having been shot with a disruptor! These things alone were a HUUUGE negative factor to the whole series for me. I guess, I&#39;ll be mentioning this fact here and then in further reviews for this series.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing for clumsy hands, since this thing is SO fragile, it might just completely disintegrate when handled too roughly.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>With a little&nbsp;hint of the cool design, that the alien ships of this series can have this spacecraft still is sooo simple. The &quot;cockpit&quot; can be opened and the pilot be ejected forward. The two &quot;wings&quot; with the blasters can be moved sideways.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Yeah, I know, the small amount of pieces is very limiting to the whole set. But still, the whole thing looks so odd and unfinished, I simply can&#39;t get myself to seeing it positively. The ugly minifigure and the instability do their parts in adding to a negative resume. There&nbsp;CAN be small sets that are convincing, my reviews of the Atlantis series have shown that. But this thing simply does not.</p>
