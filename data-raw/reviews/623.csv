"Novelty","2007-05-11T06:28:36.197Z","Full of Rocks","This review is for the Castle half of this set.  Basically, this is a catapault with a soldier and some rocks to throw.  The catapault looks nice and seems to be solidly designed and built.  The only thing that's bad about it is the fact that it doesn't throw the stones that far, but of course, that's only because these stones are bigger.  The rest of the set seems well thought out as well, with quite a bit of accessories and fluff to make it look nice.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-17T15:31:32.187Z","Two sets at one","This is a double set, this have a spaceship from the theme spyrius and a catapult from the royal knights. 
The spaceship isn't big, have itens, used as other things, like the black weapons, used here as two jets with glowing green pieces. This have also control panels, one isn't next to the minifigure, but it isn't a problem. Black wings are made by plates, in these have claw pieces keeping the jets. Glowing blue pieces are also in this set, in the front and in the sides of a part under a control panel and above red ramp pieces next to the other two panel controls. The glowing green visor is a cool piece to make a cool color scheme with the red helmet. Some pieces of this first sets are useful, like the red plate under the front of the set, and a piece that keeps in feet the UFO spaceships. Altough the cockpit isn`t completed, the minifigure is good positioned.
The other set, from castle, is too useful, and the colors make effects. The blue and black were very used on old sets, and still useful for the newer ones. Four wheels are included, for the catapult run well and the playability be greater. Ramp blue pieces are in a good size for the shooter part of the catapult, and a hose piece don`t makes this part dismantles. A plate also keeps the carrier part of the catapult to this don`t falls. This shots well pieces of lego system. The minifigure, of a royal knight, have a helmet, and in this can also be putted a shield and two axes. A white flag is also included. This is an useful set and have contents for castle themes. 
Overall, these sets have useful pieces, good playability altough some parts incompleted, are greater than the new castle and space(mars mission). The minifigures are simple, but also are more well designed than the trolls or the aliens. This double set deserves a rate 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

	<span style="""">This set came along side a space ship so it is hard to judge it fairly as a castle collector is only getting half the actual LEGO goodness they pay for, it&rsquo;s also US only which is very disappointing. I like the set, it&rsquo;s got some good accessories and is a nice sturdy build but it&rsquo;s just not worth going to the trouble of getting it unless you like space too. One minor note this set is the only siege weapon available for the Royal Knights.</span></p>
