Bought this in Toys R Us","I bought this plane because my mum couldn't afford the Airport or the Cargo Plane, and anyway this plane is already half the price of a Cargo Plane and almost the same size as it. Once assembled, the plane is great and quite sturdy, but the wings are quite horrible and I wish they would use moulded large wings for it instead. If you plan to place a car or objects larger than the door in the cargo area, make sure you do it WHILE assembling that area. Once fully assembled, it's gonna be really really difficult to open the roof up and the sides so you can insert a car inside. However, if you have a motorbike (I am trying to recreate a scene from Indiana Jones in which Mutt's bike is also brought along) you can easily place it just by removing the wing, opening the door and push it inside. Then just place back the wing and tada. The rear wing is quite nasty and it doesn't look very nice. It's shaped the like end of a Fish and Chips fish and not a shark's fin.

Overall, this set is not bad, if you're looking to start an Airplane section in your town layout, get this one, it's not bad. If you have spare tiny wheels, you can transform this into a normal airport-landing plane rather than a pontoon plane. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

i hear you ask why 3? the reason i rated it three out of five is because its quite delicate and as i said, no fun without some sets to do with it. it doesnt float so thats a let down. but apart from that its held up by 2 long bricks, limiting the space for minifigures and litttle things, but with the detailed control panel and the classic lego city police character if you have a set to do with it, it will be a good buy. i wouldve rated it as a four if i ahd a set to do with it, which hopefully i will

thankyou for reading
