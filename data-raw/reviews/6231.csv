The yellow colour may be not so appealing for adult fans, but this set offers a good variaty of quite useful parts. Very recommended for LEGO beginners. This is very basic, but never boring.

"Cashcleaner","2008-02-05T20:20:57.56Z","Nicely detailed Creator kit","I picked this kit up at the local Toy R Us for $40.00 CAN and I really believe it's the best Creator kit thus far.  While the building itself is smaller than the other Creator house kits, the overall design and internal details of the Beach House are unsurpassed.

The building is laid out in a pretty realistic manner, and features a small staircase, outside patio, and second floor balcony.  There is  also a good variety of large and small windows which gives the house a lot of character.

The only issue I have is the colour scheme.  Yellow, black, and white clashes a bit too much, and I think I would have prefered colours similar to that of the previous house models.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Skut","2008-02-20T08:18:11Z","Outstanding house but price warning to Aussie buyers","Sorry to make this review title so specific to Australia, but a number of the US reviewers have commented on the excellent value of this set in the US.  Aussie buyers beware: at AUD50, this set is much less good value although still not really a rip-off.  

Now, with the warning out of the way, to the review... this is one of Lego's best ever house designs.  It's a real step up from the 06 and 07 Creator houses, not least because of the inclusion of a floor in the upper level.  The overall design is modern, functional and, with lots of glass, very light and airy.  If you hate yellow it's not for you but I think, for a &quot;beach house&quot;, the colour scheme works.  

The build is non-challenging, non repetitive and generally fun all round.  The only annoying lapse is the omission of a dooe for the upstairs balcony but it does not really detract from the looks of the model as it is well concealed - a bit of a drain on play value though.  A real plus is the little details and knicknacks such as the doorbell, satellite dish, staircase, fireplace and, my favourite, the barbecue!

True Lego afficionados will note the revanp of the doors and windows - there are pluses and minuses here.  The main minus is that it is now almost impossible to open a door or window from the outside without removing the roof to gain access and push from the inside.  Not really a problem in this model but a possible concern for custom creations (which, after all, is what Creator and indeed Lego is all about).  

Nevertheless a great set and, at minifig scale, an excellent addition to any townie's layout.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The Satellite dish is a nice touch, so is the fire place. Additionally, all the skylights are neat. There is really no flaw to this set, and you can make two other superb models with the parts.

In the distant past, a Lego house may have tended to be like a child's drawing of a house, but *this* one is like a proper architect-designed construction, with lots of nice details.

It's surprising they didn't put a few furnishings inside - but of course you can add those yourself - and the lack of minifigs might seem odd. Before I got it, I wondered if the house is perhaps not on minifig scale. But it is, and I have added some people who are very much at home there.

I suggest not building this model, it doesn't make any sense. The rooms are more like cubby holes, and in one of the rooms, the instructions tell you to put a random black heap of bricks in the corner. I don't know if this is supposed to be a tv or a deformed couch. In the second floor there's a cheap chair and computer. The cafe and the beach house are great, though, with a removable roof on each, unlike the creator house models. The beach house includes a grill, a patio, and a table with an umbrella protruding from the center. The disappointing aspect is the barren inside of the house, but on an optimistic note, it allows one to personalize the furnishings. Buy this set for the cafe,(which has a good inside) and for the beach house. Forget the apartment building, it's basically worthless.",FALSE,4,3,4,3,4
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-12-29T14:33:24.03Z","Great house, can use more of these!","I got this for Christmas and loved it. Set includes a bright, yellow house with  nice windows (inside, there is a fire place and stairs [I have lots of pieces, so adding furniture isn't a problem], outside, there is a chinmey, a RADAR DISH!, GUTTERS!, balcony, and lights), picnic table with cups, BBQ grill with turkey leg, flowers, checkered walkway, tree, mailbox and flowers. This set is very convenient beacuse you can take of half the house to add furniture to the main floor, and if you want to add furniture on the second floor, you can just open the sky roof for full access. This is ingenious! The only problem in this set was that the black door kept bending when it opened and closed, but this was easily replaced.

"Brock_the_Builder","2008-04-25T10:02:24.53Z","Nice set with unique features","As soon as I saw a picture of this set, I had to have it.  After checking more than 5 stores (where it was all sold out), I bought it from Lego.com. 

I chose to build the beach house first, although I love the other build options as well.  The house has some unique features and details like the outside lights, the swing open windows on the roof, the grill, the mailbox, and much more!  I love how they make you actually build the tree (like the old days) instead of just giving you a tree to stick on there (recent years).

My only complaint about the set is that it is small (but hey, for $30, it rocks) and that it is a little flimsy in certain areas-- namely the yellow pillar pieces and the stacked clear windows.  I had a hard time getting these pieces to click.

Other than that, this set is a nice addition to any collection, and a must have for the low price.  Even better, the other builds include DIFFERENT UNIQUE features such as a kitchen setup in the cafe build, and a laptop and computer desk in the high-rise build.  I love LEGO's ingenuity on these tiny parts.  The grill is simply awesome.

You get 10 full sized windows and a bunch of smaller windows too.  The house was very fun to put together, and the attention to detail is great (I love the chicken leg on the grill!).

A must have at the price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Paradosis","2009-06-16T01:45:16.7Z","Great Set","This set is one of the better-liked Creator sets that has come out in recent years, and for good reason. Measuring ten inches by five inches, it's smaller than some of the other recent houses released, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in the details, both inside and outside the buildings.

The yellow, black and greys of the color scheme are nice enough, if a bit unrealistic... it's not like you see a lot of bright yellow buildings around. But Lego houses have never been known for their realism (bright red rooves, anyone?), so this can't be considered a major gripe. Thankfully here we have black roofs, which look fine. Though I do have to admit that it'd be nice to have some other color roofs some time. There are also some nice accent colors like brown, red and green. 

The only issue that spans all three models is the haphazard way in which the flowers are arranged, though the flowers do add a nice touch and provide some color to the set.  Not really an issue, but something to look out for, is also the sheer number of 1x1 dark and light grey tiles used for walkways, steps and patios. It can get a bit tedious at times, especially when taking the walkways apart when it's time to tear it all down.

The design of the first model, the beach house, is pretty good, with lots of nice details added, including a satellite dish, a brick-built tree, a fire place, a mail box with mail in it, and stairs to get to the second floor of this ""beach house"". This model also has a food-centric theme, with the outdoors table and chairs, and the BBQ complete with a piece of chicken on it. One issue that I need to point out is that the roof of this main model is a bit awkward, and looking in through the windows at the top of the roof will merely give you a view of the roof on the other side. The only other issue that I can think of--and admittedly it's a small one--has to do with the yellow and black fencing, which matches the color scheme and thus it fits in, but overall is merely adequate.

The design of the second model is also good, this time presenting us with a very small-scale eatery of some kind. We continue to see the food oriented theme, with a fountain drink area, a place to make chicken, bottles/drinks, and an outdoors eating area with a bench and table. This design doesn't have as many details, but does have a nice design feature here and there, such as the angled front door. Again, the yellow and black fencing shows up, though that's not a huge issue in the whole scheme of things. The top of the roof for the second model has a more interesting and less awkward design than the first model, though overall the second model doesn't quite reach the same level as the first model. Also, the gutters are a nice attempt at adding detail to the model, but to me they somehow detract rather than add to the model.

The design of the third model is also good, though the least enjoyable of the models in my opinion. It's just too small and doesn't really have much of a presence to it. So, while it's the tallest of the buildings at ten and a half inches tall, it's still too slender and doesn't have a lot of meat to it. Thus it's a shame that so many pieces were left over once this particular model was completed. There is also an odd design feature, where the windows are doubled up, with one in front of the other, and these windows are also partially obstructed.

On a more positive note, one nice feature though is that the back left open for easy internal access. As for details for the third model, there are two balconies, which is nice, even though there is no way to get to them from the inside of the building. There are also mini-awnings over the doors and front windows, nice walkway and front steps, a table and a couple seats inside, a desk and computer, a mail box, and lights on the balconies. This model isn't as food oriented as the other two models, though there is still a mini-bench and table for eating outside on the covered patio. Also, the dark grey and black fence lining the lefthand side is more attractive in my opinion than the yellow and black fence used in other models. 

So we have some solid models here, with lots of little details added, and a few minor issues here and there. I think it's a nice change that the instructions give ideas for both residential and commercial buildings. Is it worth the price? I'd say yes, definitely. Even as a part pack it's a nice set, and with the model designs you get it's all the more a good value. I'd definitely recommend picking this one up, as you get a lot of value and fun for your money with this one. I'd give the set a 90/100.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

What a fantastic little house. So far we have only built the main model, as I'm not 'allowed' to build the others just yet.

The second floor is easily removed to show the fireplace and the stairway.
To access the second floor, the 2 large windows in the roof open up.

The BBQ is a great touch, as is the outdoor setting.

My only complaint is that there is not more interior furniture, such as a bed upstairs, and maybe a couch downstairs in front of the fireplace.

"MetroiD","2009-01-22T18:08:47.357Z","Gives you plenty of food of thought","I was quite happy to see that LEGO have decided to keep this set and not replace with a new product like the Town House. The reason for that is that, out of all 3 ""house"" creator sets, this one seems to be the most reasonable & vivid one. Very nice color setup, 3 designs, all of which are awesome and different from each other, and best of all - a bunch of bricks which can not only be used as a stand-alone set to develop your imagination, but would also make a marvellous addition to any city building LEGO fan out there.

I was so impressed by the designs that this set came with that I am building all three of them before I take it to pieces once again and use the set as a part of my city.

The rain gutters, porch lights, the BBQ with movable top and not to forget the amazing satellite dish! The mailbox was a bit disappointing, I expected it to hold more. But it still looks very nice. 

The build was fairly easy, aimed at a younger audience with clear instructions for each 'layer' of the walls and detailing. I spotted an error in the instructions where 1 1x1 yellow brick was missing from the inventory list. 

I've combined it with the City Mini-Figure Collection to have someone live in it. Although they don't have any inside furniture (so I put the wooden bench in the living room), sleeping on the top floor will be cold as there is no door to the balcony.

The house roof can be removed so you can manage the interior easily, there are quite a number of windows and doors that can be opened, all these make the house highly playable.

One special thing that differentiate the beach house from the other ""House"" based sets is that, somehow it gives a sense of relaxation, and even perhaps, romance for some people, it is casual, and imagine, Beach, sunshine, summer breeze...

I find that this house is the most aesthetically pleasing of the Creator houses on the market at the moment.  If the town house set was still available in stores I would recommend getting that over this set but this set is your best bet if you're looking for a house available in stores.  The price to brick ration is great and you can also build the apartment building and a cafe in addition to the beach house.

The house is very detailed on the outside.  A picnic table and umbrealla, cups, bbq with chicken on it, satellite dish, chimney...it's a great set.  Using circular light pieces to create flowers is a great idea.  I used this method to create flower beds in other parts of my lego city.  Constructing the tree out of bricks is another nice feature of this set.  I also like how there are stairs leading from the main floor to the top floor.  Many other lego sets do not include stairs in multilevel buildings which is a simple but I think necessary detail. 

The set does have its flaws though.  The mail does not fit all the way into the mailbox.  There are no minifigures.  I think all lego sets should come with minifigures. There is no detail on the interior of the house.  As with most lego houses there are a lack of windows at the rear of the house.

I had this set for about two months before I deconstructed it for its pieces but I kept the instructions in case I want to build it again.

This set is worth every penny and as far as I can tell the only drawback to this set is that the mail didn't actually fit all the way inside the mailbox, but that is a small minor detail that one should not pay much attention to.

"taffer1979","2011-05-17T00:15:19.723Z","Awesome House, No Furniture?","<p>I bought this to add some regular houses to my Lego city. The house is designed perfect, its structure is very sound. I put it in the middle of my city since it can be viewed from all angles.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>4 sided design 
<li>Sound structure(hinges and 2nd floor remove perfectly) 
<li>Bar-B-Q 
<li>Tiled walk ways 
<li>Tree 
<li>Stairs</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>No Furniture 
<li>No Minifigs</li></ul>
<p>I bought this off Ebay for $40, but it included 3 minifigs that the previous owner must have threw in. I would recommend this to anyone adding to your Lego city. This was my first creater set and I will be buying more of the houses.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<ul><li>No minifig, unlike newer creators</li><li>no furniture, but that's to be expected</li><li>interior is a bit cramped</li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>I actually enjoy the coffee shop alternate even better than the standard house build. That one gives you a nice counter with built in display case, an espresso maker, and a ""warming bin"" to hold your pre-cooked food (the turkey leg in this case), along with a couple of coffee cups.</p><p>Solid set really. &nbsp;The plethora of 3-pane windows is great for future MOCs and the table with umbrella and outdoor barbecue are nice touches.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4
"dsdoak","2011-05-19T16:05:58.153Z","A superb model with great playability","<p>This is an excellent set thad adds to LEGO's great selection of Creator houses. My personal favourite of the three models is the original beach house, which looks nice and is built very well. It is quite interesting to build with a variety of shapes and sizes. In terms of playability, I like the apartment-style model as it is easily accessible from the back and provides instructions for indoor and outdoor furniture. I don't care much for the cafe model, but others seem to favour it.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A variety of windows</li><li>Unusual but attractive colour scheme</li><li>An awesome barbeque!</li><li>Lots of colours (red, green, yellow, black, grey, white, etc)</li><li>Instructions for three models</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Tree falls apart easily</li><li>Chimney tends to fall off</li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>A modification I made with the beach house model is removing the small windows on the roof and switching the extra layer of sloped bricks to the opposite side, as I find it looks nicer. This set is great for people who want value for their money (3 models for the price of 1, like most Creator sets). It gives a cheery look to what might otherwise be a drab LEGO town. I'm verry happy and glad to have spent those forty dollars!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"middleton83","2012-06-22T18:29:04.61Z","The beach house that's a bit cramped","<p>I thought it was quite a good model, especially since I borught it for about 25 euros, when I went to France on a holiday.</p>
<p>I think thought that the worst feature thought is that there is basically no room to move around in, By the stairs and lego person can't get through because the gap is too small, there is not enough room for furniture, well maybe a cardboard box and a small TV.</p>
<p>Also On the 3 storey tower thing you can build, there is also very little room to put furniture, but the ground floor has a post box, the second floor has an office, that's pretty cool actually, and the third and final floor is well, ummm, I don't know becuase it's too confusing it's like a very bad bathroom or something.</p>
<p>The other model you can make, is a pub or restraunt, probally a pub and that is pretty good but there is not much room on the inside but it does have an amazing counter to make up for that, but there is some room upstairs for a quick nap or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I would buy this model but possibly make my own models out of it.</p>
<p>PS you can make a train station out of as well, I know becuaseI've done it before.</p>

"Puffypolo","2023-01-29T12:58:24.523Z","Awesome house","<p>A great house from the Creator line 3 in 1.</p>

<p>The main build and one of the models goes very well with an urban scene. Build several in&nbsp;another colours&nbsp;and you&#39;ll get a nice residential area.</p>

<p>I changed mine to medium blue and a single white stripe in the middle, kind of wooden houses from northern Canada or something.</p>

<p>Recommend it.</p>
