"bsmarthen","2007-11-24T11:31:03.89Z","Nice set","Unlike the other review I own this set. This set is very nice. The set I have didnt come with the dog. The truck is good same stud width as the 2007 trucks. Four minifigures and a fourwheeler which uses pieces from the racers sets. This set fits very well with the rest of my city. THe only thing is now police cars have blue in them instead of the black. Still a must have for anyone with a city.

The piece for the trailer can also be used to make a low boy train car.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2008-08-22T12:52:13.233Z","Cool Truck but Too Big","I think Lego should make more of those police trucks, but this one is too big. It will hog up the road in your town. However, it is useful in your town. The interior is pretty nice with the computers and other stuff. This is good, but needs to be smaller.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"TXClark","2007-12-09T22:46:01.09Z","2008's are arriving!","Picked up this rig at TRU today, nice to see some new city material on the shelves again. Just to clear up previous reviews on 7743, there is not a dog. It's not pictured so either so not sure why some think it's expected to be included in this set.

Pros- I like it all for the most part.
*Big Truck
*Bigger Trailer
*4 wheeler ATV
*4 Minifigs

Cons-
*Driver sits up too high, his head is above the top of the windshield (easy fix, remove 2x2 plate under seat).
*The slide out in the back of the trailer slides out too easy IMO.

I really enjoy the trucks, so a tractor trailer is a nice change and this one is big. Looking forward to more trucks soon...",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2008-06-16T22:39:25.61Z","The Cops Are on the Move! ","When a stakeout is needed to catch  a crook, the police know what vehicle to use: the Police Command Center! Anyways, this set comes with amazing features like detachable rear, turning wheels, opening compartments, an ATV vehicle, an openinig toll booth, handcuffs, and a great list of minifigures. This set really completes the classic city police collection; without it the police would have no way of catching and locking up criminals on the go. Great set! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"skipp","2008-01-24T09:58:05.7Z","not bad","I got this set not to long ago, It's not all that bad but the old mobile command centre had a few things better. The roof was better, not one big old piece. Also it turned better and didn't get stuck, plus it had a radar and light on top.

Pros:
Nice big computer
First ever lego handcuffs
4 minifigs and a small HQ
lego quad

Cons:
2 doors aren't all that stable
No place to lock in prisoner
Can't turn all the way
Not enough room for all the warning signs

Otherwise, its a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Rad","2009-01-10T06:24:39.17Z","Very cool set!","As a kid I always used to build different mobile Police type command centre vehicles, so when I saw this set on the shelf I just had to get it.

The whole concept is cool, both sides on the trailer lift up, there is a pull out container for handcuffs, walkie-talkies and other stuff along with another separate cabin, which I'm not sure what for exactly.

I'm not too fond on the ATV and small HQ inclusions seeing as the command centre is mobile in itself. Perhaps 2 bikes could of replaced the ATV for 'escort' purposes..

"lotographia","2009-07-29T06:17:15.75Z","Bad boys, bad boys, watcha gonna do...","This is a pretty good set. It comes with three different models to build, from the very small to the very large; it contains a lot of details and accessories; the cab and trailer can function together or independently, with a yellow block to hold up the trailer when it's not attached.

The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that the criminal doesn't have his own accessories. The new Space Police sets all have a balanced number of police vehicles and criminal vehicles, but the City sets only have police sets. Why doesn't he have a van full of stolen loot? Or a getaway car? Or even just a motorcycle of his own? Maybe he's barricaded part of the street with barrels and wooden beams and is making a stand-off behind a tipped-over ice-cream van. He doesn't even have a cage within the police truck itself.

The playability of this large set would have been greatly improved by the presence of a criminal component. As it is, this set is for people who just want to play cops - not cops and robbers.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Krogh","2010-01-08T19:36:18.343Z","Awfull cab, all else is great.","Let me just start of by saying that i got this in a superpack that is currently not listed on this site. It's city superpack 3in1, 66305. It consists of this set, the 7245 prisoner transport, and the 7235 Police bike. I bought the whole pack for 249 DKR (about 50 USD), and i think it's a good deal, considering the inflated prices on Lego here in Denmark. It would normally have cost 500 DKR (about 100 USD), so it was half price more or less. Not bad.

Now, on with the review, this set has 3 units, the truck itself (cab & trailer), a small police ATV, and a small police building. So it has great value for the money, with lots of parts.

The cab is just awfull, so many flaws that it's really terrible. The driver is situated in the middle, unlike the other trucks where he sits a little to the left. On top of that, he sits so high, that he can't look out the front window, and it can't even be correctet without changing the main design of the truck. Just terrible. The cab has no rear lights, save for two lights on the back of the cabin. No lights on the frame, and no license plate on the back either. The frame is flawed in it's design. It's way to wide, and it's just a black plate, no detail what so ever. No tractor truck would be build like this in real life, and to my knowlegde, no other lego truck in this line is either. If i had the parts i would make a new, proper frame for it. The cab seemingly has no fuel tank?? Just fake compartment on both sides (mmmm, gotta love those stickers, NOT!). Lastly, there are yellow bricks thrown in at random. Spoiles the color scheme completely.

Now the trailer on the other hand, is excellent! Filled with crisp detailes everywhere. Only complaint is that the removable compartment in the back slides out way to easy.
It has 3 rooms, a storage room in the front, to store the cones that come with it, the main survaillence room in the middle, complete with computers, maps and so on. The sides of the trailer opens up for easy acces to this room. Then theres the removable room in the back. It has bars, so i would asume it is to hold the prisoner. Unfortunatly, he will only fit in there if he lies down, so it's not very comfortable at all, but who cares, right? Criminals don't deserve comfort. ;)
It allso has an antenna on the roof, wich can be raised when the unit is in ""survaillance mode"". other than that it comes with a stand for the trailer, used when it's not hooked up to the cab, two cones, and a fence, only downside is that the fence can't be stored in the trailer during transport, or, at least i haven't found room for it yet.

The small little ATV is a fun accessory, not much to say about it, just fun to build, funt to play with, and fun to look at. :)

Finally, the building. I think that this might just be the best designed thing in the whole set. It has a traffik boom, complete with stop and go lights, and a booth, a video survaillance camera, antenna on the roof, radar, complete with monitor inside, it has a computer screen, a radio, well, it even has a coffee mug. It's small but in 2 floors, with a staircase to the second floor. Really an excellent little building, i just love it!

minifigs are great as allwas, there are 3 cops, and a prisonor. There are a few accessories to, like hand cufs, radio, and the before mentioned coffee mug. :)

So all in all, this is a great set, although i am really dissapointed by the cab. If you get this set, you should also be prepared for lot's and lot's af stickers, located in tricky places. When will you learn lego, stickers are NOT a good thing! Just print the pieces like in the olden days of yor, hehe. Oh well, they probably don't even read these reviews anyway.

The set recieves a 4/5, because of the lousy cab. Get this set, your Lego city police force will love it, and so will you!

"SgtSmash","2010-11-12T14:24:20.357Z","Eh","<p>I bought this #7743 Police Command Center set a while back, thinking it would be discontinued soon. It definitely has a cool look to it, and seemed to offer a ton of play possibility. But once I built the set, I couldn't help but feel just a bit disappointed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truck&nbsp;looks&nbsp;huge on the box,&nbsp;and gives the illusion that you're getting this massive playset. But in reality, it's not all that large and&nbsp;doesn't quite offer a sense of reality.&nbsp;Something like this in human scale would&nbsp;probably stand about 12' off the ground and tower over a&nbsp;person, and would have more than just two rear wheels.&nbsp;The Agents 2.0 Mobile Command Center was quite the massive set, but that was $119 USD and had no hope of fitting on streets. This is why I'm sure Lego downscaled it quite a bit and made it more cost effective. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set isn't all that bad. But when you think about it,&nbsp;how often do you think Police have to&nbsp;bust out a mobile command center? Major cities or the FBI&nbsp;might have something like this for&nbsp;use in hostage situations or terrorist attacks...etc., but for play sake,&nbsp;let's say someone in Lego City tipped over the gas station. Rather than send a couple patrol cars to assess the situation, out comes the big guns with enough computer and sattelite imagry to track a small army? And there's just enough room in the rig to store 1 or 2 criminals to haul them to jail? Seems like a total waste of taxpayer money!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TLG tosses in a checkpoint center as well to help justify the cost, but&nbsp;unless you set it up near Police HQ, good luck finding a decent place in your town to put it.&nbsp;An outpost on the edge of town or thrown in next to area businesses&nbsp;or residences&nbsp;just seems weird. The little quad runner is cool,&nbsp;to catch up to the bad guys if they take off on foot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know, I guess I thought the set would be bigger. Aside from that, it's not a bad set, just one that really serve much of a true purpose. </p>

"MilkyBarKid","2010-11-03T13:33:13.99Z","A bit pricey","Overall I'd say this is a good set an a great addition to the City Police Force.&nbsp; The truck looks fantastic and has lots of cool elements inside which are great for playability.&nbsp; The mini Police Station is excellent to serve as a small hub to the main Police Station Headquarters Set 7744.&nbsp; I have located my mini Police Station from this set alongside the City Corner Set 7641 incase there are any robberies or break-ins at the Bike Shop or Pizza Restaurant.&nbsp; My only gripe with this set is the price.&nbsp; Considerring what you get in the set, I think £36.99 is a little pricey, I personally think it is worth about £20-£25.",FALSE,5,4,4,4,3
