Just got this set today (11/20/07) at TRU in Columbus, Ohio.  The minifig comes with a set of handcuffs and there is a storage compartment on the side of the craft.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brickbuilder711","2007-11-25T11:25:38.17Z","Just Perfect!","Well picked this up and 8290 at TRU in Miami, FL. 2008 is another great year in my books, and this is another great set.

I am happy to say that there is minimal juniorization in the copter, only in the bottom. The compartments are something new to a smaller helicopter as well as the handcuffs. The build is great, and I like the blue inclusion. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cashcleaner","2008-01-30T18:26:33.607Z","Pretty good buy","I picked this kit up at the local Toys R Us for 12.99 CAN, and I'd say it's a good deal for what you get.  As a helicopter goes, there's not a lot of special features, but the overall design is really nice and the mounted camera system is a nice touch.

The helicopter doesn't feature very many accesories, but the included set of handcuffs and binoculars will probably come in handy.

Nothing really amazing with this kit, but still worth the money.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

My highest buying price is $10.  But i gave in and bought it anyway.

Pros
everything!
Perfect for search and rescuse, hostage situations, and car chases

The handcuffs are pretty much awesome, only bad thing about them is that they are made up of extremely cheap plastic, and if you bend them the wrong way, they start the snap. Other than that, there are a ton of stickers, but it comes with spare stickers for each one, a major plus if you mess up. Overall, a great addition to anyone's city.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Great small set! A must buy.

 This set is a great add-on to your city. Nice color scheme. Great handcuffs. The only bad thing is you have
to take the window and the rotors off to access the control area.

"Loganwan","2008-03-01T03:03:35.653Z","I Like It!","The only other helicopter I had in my collection until now came out in 1989, so this one is a major jump.  The best part of the helicopter are the rotars.  They are big and sturdy, and fold up for storage back at the base. 

The double storage containers are a nice touch, and allow for the inclusion of some goodies for the pilot.  Another good addition to the set is the camera mounted on the skid.  Mine falls over often, so I have to be careful with it.

Overall a good kit.  This was a well thought out idea, and makes for a sturdy eye in the sky at a price point that is very good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-07-23T22:17:34.31Z","Nice and sleek","I've always wanted a police helicopter, and here it is! This is probably the best helicopter I've ever seen. The overall design is sleek and streamlined, not boxy like those 70's helicopters. This set comes with a pilot, a pair of binoculars, a set of handcuffs, a camera, and DETAILED controls in the cockpit. This set goes well with the new police headquarters. The only thing I didn't like about the set was that the arrow stickers don't go on the doors too well. Although this is a perfect set, I customized it a little to make it even better. All in all, a must have and worth the $12.99 CAD. Too bad the fire helicopter wasn't this nice :(",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DVDWow","2008-11-12T14:54:39.89Z","Wow!","We built this set last night and we were pleasantly surprised how awesome it is. My fiance picked this up at Target when it got clearanced out at $9.00, so it was a bargain. The number of pieces and the &quot;coolness&quot; factor of the set definitely make it one of the best $10 sets in recent memory in my opinion. The design is extremely sturdy, including some storage capacity for small items. The handcuffs do have to be bent to fit in, but the binoculars is a cool addition, and it's easy to throw a pistol in there as well.

The one minifig is very cool, he's a unique looking cop. I wish this set came with 2 minifigs, like a robber, but what can you really expect for $10?

All and all, this set was a real pleasure to build, is extremely fun to play with. The blades are extremely innovative in that they fold up for storage, which is awesome as well. I would say this is one of my favorite sets I've made in years, despite the small size.

"spyder38","2008-11-04T18:48:41.937Z","Worth The Money","First off, the price is good, and better than most Lego sets priced at $10. The rotors, as mentioned before, are genius. Especially the disc on top. So simple, yet I would have never thought of it. The two storage containers are nice, and you have two items to put in them, binoculars, and handcuffs. The handcuffs will not fit, you have to bend them. But no worries, their is a space right behind the seat to put them. The cop has a nice face and torso, but in the picture his plastic shield that comes down in front of his face looks gold. However, it is only see-through gray. But I do like it better that way. He doesn't have a weapon. The police mini-figures should at least come with some type of gun-maybe a revolver or the guns the agents have. But that is what BrickArms is for! The color scheme is great, and I love the camera. The stickers aren't too bad, it comes with a rare printed control console also. PS. Mine came with two sheets of stickers :) and on each sheet, it also had not only stickers in English, but also ones in some other language. Overall a great set, and I recommend that you get it!

"legospongepotter","2010-12-12T11:11:07.013Z","Cool Set","Now, I don' often get Lego City sets, let alone these Police sets. But my dad got this for me since I did good on my report card, and I thought 'Well, this is nice and cheap' so that's how I got it. Let's get to the review, shall we?<br><br>Minifigure: You get one standard police minifigure. He has a white helmet with a clear visor. His head is that normal smile with silver glasses. I like the printing on the torso. It's a cool black jacket with a belt, pockets, a zipper, and a badge. Then he had normal black legs. It'd be nice if they included a criminal or something, though.<br><br>Before You Build: Just a few things you'll notice before the build. The bags are NOT numbered, but there's only two so it's still pretty easy. The box is basically the helicopter with the cop rushing forward with a pair of handcuffs. On the back you get you see the cop in the set, standing in front of the helicopter, and taking out some accessories. The instructions are easy to follow and is decent sized, with a few ads in the back. Then the stickers. There are lots of them, but each sticker has a duplicate...in Spanish!&nbsp; Now for the set<br><br>Helicopter: I'm going to start with the back tail thing. It was simple and easy to build, and this black piece spins. On the bottom of the set where those gray pieces are you get two accessories. First, that piece did not come in a bag, and two, you get a nice yellow light and what looks like a camera attached to it. <br><br>On top the blades spin smoothly, and can be moved up and down and easily taken off. You can give it the effect that the blades have been destroyed. Very easy to build. Inside you get a 'seat' and this computer/control panel which is printed! it's kind of hard to put the Minifig inside because it ends of breaking the set a little, but it's easy to put together again. On both sides of the helicopter you get a nice blue tinted window and these storage compartments. One had a pair of handcuffs, which is my first one. The other has some gray binoculars. You get two handcuffs by the way. <br><br><br>Building experience: 4 bricks - Pretty easy but good for a beginner. I'm no beginner so it was plain easy.<br><br>Parts: 5 bricks: I like the glass windows, the two handcuffs, the printed computer, the top blades, and the Spanish stickers. <br><br>Playability: Of course, a criminal Minifig would have made it better. If you have one, though, no problem. Fun and the set is actually decent sized. Not too small or big.<br><br>Value for money: Should have been a dollar cheaper.<br>So it's a great set, not a must have but it's a cool addition. If you're
 wandering through Target or Wal-Mart, looking for a small set to add to
 your collection, this is good. I would recommend it to any Lego police 
fan. Oh yeah, it was ten bucks. Get this set if you see it. Cute and fun, basically.<br><br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"lego_octan_guy","2010-06-15T11:49:40.03Z","preety good.","It's a great set for price, but it's hard to put in the minifig and the back part breaks off alot. overall its a nice set for price and it's still pretty enjoyable and fun to play with, you cant go to rough on it though. overall i give it a 4/5.",FALSE,4,5,4,3,5
"AETerry","2011-11-21T19:35:03.313Z","Police Helicopter Review","At $9.99, this is a very good, modest little set worthy of adding to any City/Town collection, especially for those looking to expand on their Police Force. If you're not collecting City or feel a need to add to an existing Police Force, then yes, this set can be skipped over.<br><br>I've collected and seen several police sets over the years and while I'm familiar with and partial to the older style of helicopters, there's only so many variations of that old style build before you run out. This set updates the helicopter design to look more modern and sleek.<br><br>I especially love the look of the new rotor blades for this helicopter, the enclosed feel of the cockpit and the idea of storage areas on the side of the copter.<br><br>While I'd love to gush and go on forever about how great this new model and design is, there are some factors that do mar the experience for me. One is the stickers... while there are many who hate them and have expressed that time and again, for me in this case... the arrow stickers on this set are too long on the side compartment doors. They should be trimmed to prevent them constantly peeling off and not sticking out. The other factor is the lengths to which pieces (rotor blades, roof and mirror) must be removed first before placing or taking out the minifigure from the helicopter.<br><br>The last little bit, depending on view point, is that if you get the 2011 Police Precinct set, there may be a compulsion to feel you have to get this helicopter set for the helipad on top of the Precinct. <br><br>Despite those thoughts and feelings, this is still a very good set. I just don't feel it's one hundred percent perfect or flawless. <br><br><br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

"kallinan","2012-11-16T09:55:49.54Z","Great $10 Set","<p>Our four year-old son started earning an allowance for doing chores recently, so naturally our two year-old wanted to follow suit. &nbsp;After earning $0.50 a week for chores for several months, the kids went to Target to spend their hard earned cash. &nbsp;We showed our two year old what he could afford, and he was absolutely smitten with the police helicopter.</p><p>Although he had played with Lego bricks for sometime, this was his first set where he attempted to follow instructions. &nbsp;He needed a little help the first few times, as he would mix up the front &amp; back of the helicopter early in the build. &nbsp;Soon he was able to build it on his own. &nbsp; And has he ever... at least 15x and counting. &nbsp;The set comes with a police helicopter pilot minifigure, along with binocular &amp; handcuff accessories.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Looks great</li><li>Good playability - ""swoosh""-able, spinning rotors, has a minifigure</li><li>One of the best $10 sets I've seen</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Stickers. &nbsp;But hey, they included both English &amp; German stickers, which our young boys found to be pretty neat.</li><li>The parts. &nbsp;I was a little disappointed at specialty parts for helicopter rotor blades and the landing skid. &nbsp;Although admittedly, a one piece landing skid does make for a very stable base, and the specialty parts of course help the helicopter look great.</li></ul>
<p>In summary, this is a really great small set. &nbsp; A lot of the Lego sets are pretty blah under $20, but this one has a fun build and is very playable. &nbsp;It matches their police patrol car (#4436), and the police station (#7498) they will be getting for Christmas. &nbsp; I hear the police station even comes with a helipad that fits this helicopter.</p>",TRUE,5,3,5,5,5

Be careful when opening this though. You usually need to bend up the posable propeller blades in order to open the cockpit. There is a cool search light in the front that moves up and down as well as a side-mounted film camera that moves in all direction to help find the bad guys. There are two storage compartment on the sides to fit binaculars and handcuffs. There is also a tail propeller&nbsp;that spins and then of corse, the top one</p>

<p>Overall I think this set is awesome because it&#39;s great to play with, build, and display! I recommend it!</p>

"Th3_3m3rald_M1n3cart","2020-06-10T00:47:21.223Z","7741 Police Helicopter Review","<p>The first thing I&#39;d like to say about this set is that it is my favourite Lego set of all time. Now your probably wondering why is this 94 piece $10 set with only 1 minifigure your favourite set? Well because this was my very first set. In 2011 when I was 3 years old I was given this set by one of my grandma&#39;s friends for my birthday. I don&#39;t remember a single thing about building it at all but I&#39;m assuming I had help from my dad, and it brings some back some very good memories.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>There is only 1 minifigure included which is unfortunate, but is only a $10 set so that is understandable. The 1 minifigure is a police pilot to fly the helicopter. He has no leg printing at all which is fine, whoever he does have some pretty nice torso printing which has a zipper going down the middle which meets up with his belt. He has a radio in the upper left corner of his uniform and a badge on the right side. His face print is a pretty common head for male lego city minifigures from 2006 to 2014 so it&#39;s nothing special, but he does have some glasses. He does also have a white helmet for him to wear but no hair piece is included. For accessories, he comes with a pair of binoculars and handcuffs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Main Build</p>

<p>The main build of this set is obviously the helicopter itself. Starting at the front it has a 4-stud wide windshield defying that this is a 4-stud wide vehicle. It has a light underneath made out of a 1x1 plate with clip and a translucent yellow stud. It has stickers on the side reading police, along with 2 compartments that hold 2 pairs of binoculars on one side and a pair of handcuffs on the other. It&#39;s tail rotor on the back has yet another 2 stickers on the side of it along with a red light. It has 4 rotors on the top which spin well. Finishing it off the bottom uses the large helicopter landing gear piece in dark gray.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Packaging</p>

<p>Unfortunately I no longer have the box, so I can&#39;t talk about it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall Opinion</p>

<p>I have a much stronger liking for this set than most people because of the nostalgic connection due to it being&nbsp;my first set. So I would definitely recommend this set because it has pretty good play value in my opinion and would be&nbsp;entertaining for kids&nbsp;to play with and doesn&#39;t&nbsp;take up much room on the shelf. Overall I think this is a fantastic set and I&nbsp;recommend purchasing it.</p>

"BrickFactoryINC","2021-10-26T03:57:38.87Z","LEGO PD fits in anywhere","<p>I had received&nbsp;this set for Christmas back in 2013 2-to 3 years after its retirement.&nbsp; This police helicopter may not be like the big ones you see between 2011 - today, but it sure does look good with any version of the LEGO City PD you have.&nbsp; This helicopter was made for the 2009 collection of Police stuff, but it fits in with any collection looking like classic lego city.&nbsp; Now, mine did have some issues like the back wing broke after about 2 months of play only recently have I replaced the wing back to normal now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This helicopter is small and agile&nbsp;making it easy to play with, the helicopter can also surprisingly fit right on top of the 2011 police station who knew.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are looking for a police helicopter that is small and don&#39;t like the design of the new ones this is a good replacement it fits, looks well with any version of police you have, or even looks classic this is for you.</p>
