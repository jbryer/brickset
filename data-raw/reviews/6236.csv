"Cashcleaner","2008-02-05T03:08:34.607Z","Most impressive LEGO City kit ever!","I'm writing this review just minutes after completing my recently-bought Police Headquarters, and I have to admit it's possibly the best LEGO kit I've ever bought.

At $120.00 CAN, the value is actually quite good when you consider the overall design and piece count (953 elements).  The main building itself is rather large with loads of room inside for the 7 minifigs that come with the set.  You've got two well-detailed levels on top of  a two-vehicle garage below, as well as an attached jail area with a surveillance tower.  There is a good flow of design between the jail and main building as well, giving the kit a bit of a realistic touch.

Other notable aspects are the communications array that bridges the gap between the two buildings and spacious vehicle garage.  Also, the number of included minifigs must be stressed - You get 5 cops, 2 robbers, and a police dog thrown in for good measure.  The kit definitely scores high on playability.

I really only have two small problems with the kit, but they are more a matter of personal taste.  The &quot;jailbreak&quot; feature detracts from the general look of the kit and I'll likely modify the jail cells and take out the levers that cause the walls to break away.  Also, I think I'd rather have a police van similar to the Prisoner Transport model (7245), than a K-9 unit truck.  Again, it's not a major issue, though.

All said, it's a very nice kit and well worth the money.  LEGO did an excellent job with this new kit.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cbaoth","2008-01-31T17:42:28.653Z","lots of fun, interesting build","Just finished building this with my four year old, loads of great features. We both got quite a laugh out of the &quot;great escape&quot; feature for the bad guys. Great to see sets with seven minifigs, in my experience with my kids, it's the minifigs that make it interesting. Playing with the set comes first with them and then building comes later.

There's really nothing bad to say about this set but if I was going to complain, I would say the police car is pretty uninteresting, no trunk etc to open or store things in.

The best part of the set, in my opinion is the prison cells, the toilets are great feature. Also by having two cells gives lots of interesting play opportunities with the bad guys teaming up to outwit the cops.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

My favourite part of the set are the trick walls and the jails. Another good thing is that the building itself is very stable. There is one thing that confuses me. How come on the wall of the jail cell, there is a drawing with tally marks, stick person, house and tree? And also, how come the briefcase is put inside the refridgerator? Oh well, who cares. Overall an exceptional set and definitely worth every penny of it. Keep up the good work, LEGO!

"turtlespit","2008-10-02T18:18:38.797Z","Not bad","After a frustrating day at work, I bought this set as my first 'AFOL set' - my return to lego after at least 15 years away.  

This was a fairly easy set to build.  The prison cells were probably the most detailed (and therefore interesting) part, and in hindsight I was hoping for some more complex sections.  Still, I was pleased with the end result and then messed around with different ways to connect the prison section with the main station.  

I also switched around the minifig faces - add the &quot;gold-tooth prisioner head&quot; to a cop, and you've got your very own dodgy corrupt cop.  (I can almost feel the innocence of my childhood being stomped on *laugh*)

It does feel like some compromises have been made - the most memorable ones being the white 1x2 groove bricks used in situations where a groove wasn't required.  I assume including even a single white 1x2 non-groove brick in the set would increase the manufacturing cost, so I understand the reasoning, especially since the grooves aren't visible from the exterior.

Also, the pieces included feel a touch limited when trying to build something else without parts from other sets.  This could be my rusty building experience though.  I've since combined parts from one of the creator series houses to create a different style police station.

Overall, 4/5 feels a little high, but 3/5 would be too low.  I'd give it 7.5/10 if the rating scheme allowed this, so the score receives the benefit of a round up to 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"HQuiff","2009-08-09T10:45:44.637Z","You'd Think The Mechanics Would Fix The Back Of Our Cells. Ah Well! Haw-haw-haw! - Random Criminal","Ok... well for a start, this set is extremely cheapo (Pronounced: Cheap-O), coming in at 50 Euro, and comes with 900 + pieces! Epic win! Anyway, this set offers tons of playability and is extremely versatile. 


Build - 9/10. Not bad at all! As soon as I came home I put it together, and it was quite fun! However trying to slip those sliding windows into place s they can, well, slide up, is a royal pain! Anyhow, everything is smooth and fits together nicely, especially the two cell blocks.

Minifigs - 7/10. Great Minifigs! It comes with altogether a few random Policemen, and two robbers (One of which is actually looking down because he's caught, unlike the guy in his neighboring cell). 
Unfortunately one of the Minifigs had a scratch on his face, but then again I doubt that happens with most of them.

Versatility - 8/10. I'm sorry to say that it's now broken up, however I can say quite honestly that it's quite good in terms of useful pieces. It has some cool white walls, and a few dark gray ones too (For the cells)! As well as quite a few black and gray bars.
Unfortunately there ARE some pieces which aren't really useful, but to be honest, there's more useable pieces rather than none useable pieces here.

Playability - 10/10. Fallings cell walls, cameras, keys, handcuffs, spotlights, and police vehicles. What DOESN'T add to the playability here?! I mean the amount of endless scenarios you can come up with, even if they are revolving around Robbers and Policeguys only.

Comments - Maybe they could add more jail cells underneath the ones up high...! I've noticed a new color scheme too, instead of black, white and gray, it's blue, black and white! There's also some new stuff that the last Police Station didn't have... like two cells, rather than one, barriers, actual parking places for the vehicles, and Keys for the cells!


Overall a nice set with nice features and functions. I highly recommend this set to anyone, and to City fans like me... a must have City Set! Especially if you liked the first Police Station.

"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-16T12:40:02.077Z","Playablity: Endless!","Wow, so much to say about this set! For one, the best set for the LEGO City Police collector: two cars (one a K-9 unit no less), a motorcycle, and the station. You can play with this for hours, put it away easily, then take it out again to play with for more hours. Definetely worth the price (Part-wise and play-wise).

The build is good for even the younger builder, since the bags are divided into 9 parts (first and second are pieces for the cars and bike, while the rest are sections of the headquarters). I had my little brother build some parts while I built others so that we both had a fair share of building (Worked well). 

The interior is so detailed, that you could make any story or video you wanted with this set. The jails are good, especially with their ""break-out"" feature for the crooks. It's as easy to put the walls back as it is to make them fall. 

The only two problems are that the stairs fall (At least for me), and it's hard to prop minifigures in the jail cells, though not impossible.

I strongly recommend this set for any LEGO builder, especially those who are very fond of LEGO City. Note parents: Your child might need some help keeping parts stable, but it shouldn't be too hard. Good for all family members to help build. I hope this review helps many considering to buy this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"JenniferGDBC","2010-03-02T14:27:53.903Z","Great set!","<p>I bought this set a few days ago, and had it built within a few hours. The build wasn't difficult, but kept me interested throughout! I was dissapointed to see that the bags inside the box were numbered, however this was expected with a city set and was easily sorted by mixing up the bags myself. I guess that most people would probably be happier with numbered bags!</p>
<p>I was impressed with the motorcycle and cars, which added to the playability of the set as did the 7 minifigures, which included two prisoners and five police men. The dog was also a nice added touch.</p>
<p>The station itself was fun to build and I found myself getting excited about features such as the garage doors and moving yellow and black barriers. The rooms also had nice details such as a water cooler, coffee machine and a computer. I was suprised that the prison cells even had toilets, adding to my enjoyment when building the set.</p>
<p>I was dissapointed that the area underneath the prison cell building was left empty, however I used that for additional parking for the police cars and motorcycles that I already owned. I also thought that the cars that came with the set could have been made up of more pieces seen as they came with such a large set. The base plates provided with them did reduce the building experience for them as I would much have prefered to build the base blates myself.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm very impressed with the set and think that it was well worth the &pound;60 that I paid for it! It's definitely the best city set that I own.</p>

Well, the number of pieces for the price is a little above average at 9.5 cents a brick. There are 7 minifigures and 2 of them are criminals which is the exact amount of cells. The thing I don't like about all the police sets is that there is a lack of jail cells, but that's with all Lego police sets, so I won't make this look bad for it. The police dog was a nice addition, and theres even a K-9 Unit to go with it. The police car is average, like the other one in the City Series. Also the ability of the criminals to break out is humorous, and unlike other sets. The search light and satellite dish are realistic touches, and the cop's place to stay and rest are just like in a real jail. when I was almost finished this my pop noticed a problem and I had to rebuild it.

"123MrBrick","2017-12-20T03:46:46.567Z","Pinnacle of An Era, and Frankly of Lego As a Whole.","<p>It may very well be nostalgia speaking, but I have (and will continue to) expressed my undying love for mid-to-late 2000&#39;s Lego numerous times. Apart from a few outliers, throw a dart at a list of themes available during that time, and you&#39;ll find a wealth of sets that have so much to offer in just about every facet. City is no slouch, not being bound by the accuracy requirements of licensed themes or the sometimes restrictive nature of more specific &quot;yellow&quot; themes. And man, do the flagship sets deliver. 7744 is the epitome of everything that went horribly right during this era, featuring the perfectly delicious blend of minifigures, realistic (but not excessive) detail, and a smattering of play features and just all around <em>fun.</em>&nbsp;Is it the greatest set of all time? No. It doesn&#39;t excel massively in any one area to put it in the running for such a title. But I&#39;ll take a handful of near-hits over one bullseye and a load of misfires.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The least interesting part of any set. Like the rest of the City range, the box for 7744 is no-nonsense, simply giving us a view of the set in its entirety and showing off the various features on the back. Nothing to exaggerate or fantasize. The instructions are similarly efficient, splitting the job up between several manuals in full-color with clear, easy-to-follow steps. Good stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Parts </strong></p>

<p>Much like the set as a whole, the parts selection features nothing particularly interesting but plenty of useful elements to still make it worthwhile for that aspect alone. The various large wall sections, car parts, garage doors, window panes, antennae, car parts, and more, not to mention the large gray road baseplate and the smaller plate, are all useful for creating a variety of structures and vehicles for a city, town, or maybe even a moon outpost. The station makes sure to hit all the basic notes, and more, for a building that it lends itself well to customization, expansion, or total rebuilds (barring the rather limiting [but obviously optional!] police stickers, of course).</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Five cops, two crooks, and a canine companion is a perfectly adequate assortment of fellows for a single police station. All the minifigure components have likely been used dozens of times across various City sets as well as in other themes, but they so carefully walk the tightrope between generic and specific that they still seem fresh here. Three rather optimistic and friendly officers contrast well with the more stern motorcycle driver and his zip-up jacket, while the heroic and sculpted chief of police squares off with the rough-looking crooks. The police dog, likewise, has been featured in a variety of sets, with its simple but charming sculpt featuring molded-in eyes. Additionally, the set contains a wealth of handcuffs, radios, flashlights, as well as some other gear and even a wanted poster for the minifigures to play around with.</p>

<p><strong>The Build </strong></p>

<p>Relatively simple structures that are approximations of real-world buildings such as 7744 are rarely difficult to put together. Nevertheless, there are still a few interesting elements to the construction, such as the angled skylight windows at the top of the main building, and the overall build of the prison cells and their pair of play functions. It shouldn&#39;t be a challenge for builders of any ages, but it still does provide an element of satisfaction to see the sometimes- complex support systems to ensure the model remains sturdy come together. Working at a steady pace and without error, this set shouldn&#39;t take more than a couple hours to finish.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>Here, of course, is where the set shines. Starting off with the smaller and less impressive components: The trio of small vehicles. All of them share a basic build with similar or identical vehicles found in standalone sets or as part of other large sets. The motorcycle is mostly two pieces, just the chassis and fairing, with some headlights added as well as the saddlebag section that is standard for police bikes. A radio or any other accessory can clip back here while the officer&#39;s hands are occupied with the handlebars. The police cruiser is similarly efficient, using minimal parts to get the necessary details and shapes. It sits one officer comfortably but you might have luck jamming a partner or a captured crook in behind them. The K9 truck predictably follows the simple style of the other two, with a hinging bar window on the back that allows the police dog in or out. With a little effort, a criminal can be crammed in there instead, allowing for more secure transport to and from the station. The cabin will only hold one figure and only really needs to. Three vehicles send three officers out, the chief must stay behind to tend to affairs, and he could probably use that last guy as backup in case something goes wrong.</p>

<p>The proper model&nbsp;is impressively large and expansive and the two main sections, the prisoner area and the station itself, can separate easily. Technic pins and pegholes allow for an alternate combination that puts the cell block behind the main station instead of being next to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the prison block is elevated, there is a large amount of dead space underneath the pillars that hold it up. It&#39;s a useful area for play, or it could be used to store extra vehicles like the motorcycle, which has no designated parking area. The far end of the block features a simple watchtower design with large windows that allow the officer at the control panel to oversee the whole station. A simple spotlight up top provides additional visibility. A catwalk of decent width lies outside the cells, allowing for easy play or display of criminals escaping or being imprisoned in the cells. Security cameras and the keys &quot;required&quot; for opening the cells ensure the crooks (probably) aren&#39;t going anywhere. A satelitte tower at the other end of the block completes the look, featuring a trio of dishes of assorted sizes on a single large beam. A fire hydrant, a bush, and a mailbox dot the fenced-off courtyard down below. The main attraction of this part of the set is the prisoner escape feature. The cells, identically constructed with a bed, toilet, and small table on the inside of each, as well as a sticker with tally marks on the back wall, feature a red switch on the back. Pushing it upwards will &quot;blow up&quot; the back wall of the cell and allow the prisoners to escape. It&#39;s a simple feature that works well and provides a window for storytelling, as well as simpler access into the cells for positioning figures. The only real downfall is the lack of a dynamite or crowbar piece for the prisoners to &quot;use&quot; to make their getaway.</p>

<p>The main police station is much more impressive in my opinion. A simple bar gate out front, complete with red and green lights, ensures that only authorized vehicles get access to the station. The short road, lined with a handful of flowers and bushes, leads to the twin garages that are intended for the car and van included in the set. A few simple tools and other details are present down here to complete the look. Sirens, lights, and another spotlight are also present from the exterior, as is a small area on the second floor where minifigures can stand, although there is no official way to access it. A staircase on the right leads to the second floor, which features an adequately-detailed reception area and break room, featuring all of the amenities typical of City sets of the era, such as a computer screen, a cabinet or two, and a water cooler. Both rooms are large enough for a handful of minifigures each, allowing for many more than just those included in the set to interact here. The break room leads out to another catwalk, which allows for another way to get to the prison block. This particular area splits in half when the two chunks of the set are separated, and so details are sparse. The third floor houses a perfectly claustrophobic interrogation room, complete with articulated lamp and a corkboard of leads, and another room for detective work with a tape recorder and coffee machine. This room leads out to yet another catwalk, which provides access to a rack of tools and a pair of megaphones as well as the control panel for the satelittes should they need any kind of tuning.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I cannot stress how well-made this set is. Every component is wonderfully&nbsp;complemented and accomodated by the others and it just creates a perfect &quot;ecosystem&quot; in a sense, but one that is also easily modified or expanded upon with other sets. It has just the right amount of details to be charming and realistic, but not too many that it doesn&#39;t seem &quot;Lego&quot;. The size of the structure, the vehicles, the cells, and the variety of available rooms provide so very many opportunities for storytelling and play that a lot of sets before and after this period just seemed to miss. 7744 doesn&#39;t do anything perfectly, but it does <em>everything</em>&nbsp;<em>right.&nbsp;</em>It plays well, it displays well, everything about it is just such a treat and exemplifies the power of Lego as a toy, as something to&nbsp;<em>do&nbsp;</em>and something to have fun with. That spirit is lacking in so many more recent sets and tracking one of these down just to experience it is well worth it.</p>
