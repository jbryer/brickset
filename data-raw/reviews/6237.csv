"SquidBot","2008-01-03T18:28:41.593Z","Cool spider, not much else","I picked this up just for the pictured spider, which is really neat and fairly large. It's currently subbing for Aragog in my Hogwarts display. There are also instructions for a wasp and a snake, but neither are that good. Unlike some of the other Creator sets, this doesn't offer much in the way of pieces beyond the many hinges. Worth the price, especially if you want a big spider, but not that special.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"brickule","2008-08-02T19:46:42.747Z","Very nice set, with good desighn","I got this set specifically for the spider model, and this is what I have to say about it.

It is a very nice set, the legs hold up the body very well, and it comes with some nice parts, it is great to hang from your ceiling, as the brick in the back has a hole in it for fishing wire. This is a great set to get for castle creations, I don't know if it is just me or not, but giant spiders are way cooler than dragons. The mouth and head look a little weird, but it is not too bad, also the legs have nice articulation. I recommend this set whether you like spiders, or are in need of a new creature for your knight to fight.

"Paradosis","2009-06-16T01:50:58.937Z","Not Really Recommended","This is one of my least favorite of the recent Creator sets. The models are done well enough, I suppose, and when posed the models look fairly nice. However, for some reason they fall short on some level and I found   them to be lacking somehow. The models are realistic looking enough, considering the size of them and that we're using plastic bricks and plates here. If I did have to pick a favorite of the three models, it'd be the main one, which is of a spider (measuring ten inches at it's widest). There is a nice, primarily black and red color scheme, with a dash of brown, tan and other colors here and there. There are also lots of of black and brown hinges. There's not much to say about the set other than that, though. This one really isn't recommended, and I'd only give it a 65/100.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Nikoniko","2009-04-30T05:43:53.263Z","Nice but weak","I bought this set in spring 2008 for my son. We built it only 3 or 4 times and already 3 pieces are broken, which is really rare with Lego bricks. The pieces I am talking about are #4521427 (x2) and #74011 (x1). I wonder whether my son played roughly with it to get that result. But his other sets are all OK.

Anyway, it is a very nice one. I particulary appreciate the joints of the legs and body which are pretty realistic. You can imagine many postures (including the one of a dead spider on its back!). The hole at the end of the body is also pretty useful to hang the spider in numberless places (I am not sure my wife appreciated some of the ones my son choosed however...)   ;)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
