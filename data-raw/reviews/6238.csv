"Leggodt94","2008-05-03T12:16:13.153Z","Cool Copter! ","It is always nice to get another lego helicopter, and it is always nice to see that LEGO has not given up on these amazing vehicles. Anyways, this set features interesting details such as spinning blades, clear window pieces, and spinning wheels. Also, this set is very unigue in two ways: it is a cargo helicopter(most choppers are either police, fire department, or hospital) and it's designed with an automatic winch, but you need to lower it manuely, and then it goes up automaticaly(I was expecting a little bit more electric power, but I can't complain with such creativity). However, there is only one concern that I have for this set: tieing the rope is time-consuming as is most lego building anyway. So, with that said, this set is a great twist on a classic model, and I highly recommend it.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DevDevBeck","2009-01-05T19:40:39.06Z","A Suprisingly Good Set","     LEGO 4995: Cargo Copter is a suprisingly good set. There are some pretty cool features on this set as well.
~Glass Pieces (of course, they aren't real glass)
~Motorized cargo lift
~3 different models to build
     The cargo copter uses a motorized piece to lift the cargo crates. The Airplane Model uses power functions, and the speedboat uses the power functions as a motor for the anchor.
PROS: 
Helicopter: -fun, easy build -cool rotors -includes rare pieces
Airplane: -uses motor on propeller -nice design -sturdy
Speedboat: -uses motor on anchor (hook) -looks interesting
CONS:
Helicopter: -Rotors break easily
Airplane: -looks strange when seen from side -Prop dosen't spin very fast
Speedboat: -breaks easily -fins aren't sturdy

If you like Aircraft, like my father & I, Then buy this set. I don't kno about you guys, but I'm buying propeller power ASAP!

Here is the closing of that review:

Features
The main feature of this set besides giving you the instructions and pieces to make 3 totally different sets, is the winch. I thought the winch was battery powered but it's not. I was very disappointed in that. But I guess that is why the set was ""only"" $19.99.

Final thoughts
Each of the three different builds, the Cargo Copter, the Airplane, and the Speedboat all look very authentic. If you think about it, it's very interesting to see how three totally different things can be made out of 95% of the same Lego parts.


My rating
Playability: 4 out of 5. It is playable. Every build is sturdy and looks just like it's supposed to. 
Design: 4 out of 5. When you consider how many parts each build shares between the other two, it's very good design on how each build looks.
Build experience: 2 out of 5. Easy to build. No stickers and the only thing hard for some is cutting the string and making knots.
Overall: 3 out of 5. It was OK of a set. I still wish the winch was a powered version.

And it comes at low cost, little weight & little room! Ideal for building in minifig-scale!

It really works well and brings some action into your models, which is not achievable anyway else - therefore: MUST HAVE!

Besides some parts in orange and dark-blue, which are rare, there are a lot of wedges etc. - parts which are useful for anything that flies (in your imagination ;-).

 Winch is a cool feature on the helicopter and boat, but the spinning propeller probably beats all. Pros and Cons:
