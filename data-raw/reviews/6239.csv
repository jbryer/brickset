Two dogs -- one of them rare, and the other one super-rare -- are only the beginning.  On top of that there are the many pink and magenta and lime green pieces, but wait -- there's more!  There are dishes, there's a rare brush piece, and there are HOT DOGS!!

I would have bought this set for the hot dogs alone, I think, except that I knew I was getting all those other fabulous items along with them.  I heartily recommend this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
