"AndreasL","2009-08-08T14:49:54.327Z","Great dino set","This is a great set. It includes two trees and a T.Rex. A trap is build into the tallest tree. When you turn the handle a couple of bricks will fall on the head of the dino.

Pros:
- Great idea.
- Good playability.
- Great that Lego included a spear to make more than one scenario (not just the trap).

Cons:
- Larger base plates would have enhanced the robustness of the set a lot. I don't know why Lego is so cheap with the baseplates. They cannot be that expensive to manufacture. As it is now it is way to easy for the child to make the trees fall over during the play.

Overall:
Recommended
