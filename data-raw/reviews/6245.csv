This set is great because you get some cute dinosaurs and some very nice plants and trees (well, tree). There is an awful huge moulded grey piece that I have never used and have chucked aside, and CAVEMEN LIVING ALONGSIDE DINOSAURS is completely wrong! I don't want to be historically pedantic, but this is bizarre. Anyway me and baby Finn like the dinosaurs, not the cavemen, so the cavemen have also remained at the bottom of our Duplo box.

But if you get this set plus the very nice 5596 Dino Birthday (&#163;7.99 UK) then you have a wonderful set of dinosaurs and quite a lot of good scenery to play with. Stir in a normal Duplo baseplate and some bricks and you can make very nice dinosaur landscapes.

The triceratops and the pteranodon both have babies, so you can do friendly parent-and-baby stuff with them ... dinosaurs don't have to be all about fighting! (Again, we leave the T-Rex out of it for now, and bring in the lovely mother and baby diplodocus from the Dino Birthday set).

In Duplo i find the animals and dinosaurs much more attractive than the people (who look a bit wierd if you ask me) and this is a very good &#163;35 (UK) dinosaur set, even if you leave some parts in the box. Very good value.
