First off, the price is only $25.00 (USD) for 650 pieces!  Usually 600-650 pieces are in the 50 dollar (USD) range.
Different Colors:
(In order they appear on top of the box)
I've decided to split this review up into sections, each section corresponding with the bricks of that color in the set.  This is easiest, because basically this set is just a box of bricks.
Yellow:
 94 bricks
Plenty of yellow bricks!  This is great if you want to combine them with the massive amount of red pieces and make a McDonalds, but otherwise, yellow is only a highlighting color.  Even on the models shown on the box, there are very few models that use mostly yellow bricks.  The only exception is the house, but then again, I've never seen anyone paint their house a full-out banana yellow.
If you want to use tis set with your existing collection of Lego bricks (which I strongly suggest), yellow might come in handy to build a submarine, a truck, or even a race car.  These things you can't really build just using the pieces in this box however, because they need specialty bricks (slopes, wheels, etc.) to be recognizable.
Red:
95 bricks
Red has the most amount of pieces, and that's great.  If you want to use this as a stand alone set you can use red for helicopters (like on the box), a red brick house, or pretty much anything else.
When you combine red bricks with specialty pieces, the possibilities become eve more immense.  You can make sports cars, trucks, and spaceships.  You can even use red as a highlighting color on your black creations.
Blue:
94 bricks
There are just the right amount of blue bricks.
Ether way, you can use blue for houses, any body of water, or for clothing (if you want to build people instead of using minifigs).
The only two extra things you can build with blue bricks and specialty pieces are sports cars, and those classic spaceships.  Hay!  Maybe you could even use the massive amount of yellow pieces for canopies on those spaceships!
Orange:
58 bricks
Orange is the first color in which the amount of 1x1 bricks jumps from 18 down to 15.  There are just the right amount of orange pieces, as other than making pumpkins, orange is generally used as a highlighting color.
Brown:
49 bricks
As with orange, brown is only a minor color.  It is usually used for anything earthy (dirt, tree trunks) that doesn’t look good in green.
Lime Green:
58 bricks
It's great to see another color that can be used for plant life other than regular green.  However, Lego should have added more black pieces instead, and just stuck with regular green.
Green:
56 bricks
Lego decided to include the same amount of green bricks as brown, expect for the 2x1s.  This is ok I guess, as they are both generally used for earthy things.  However, you can't build a brown house.
White:
90 bricks
There are just the right amount of white bricks.  Whether you decide to use this is a stand alone set or not, white can be used for a base or highlighting color.
Black:
56 bricks
This is my only major complaint with the set.  There are hardly any black bricks, and I know that at least I use black a lot.  Not only that, but the largest black piece is a 4x2.  Even in one of the sample models on the back of the box Lego has to combine black bricks to make a 12x2!  If only Lego had decided to omit the lime green pieces and include more black ones.
Overall:
Price: 10/10
Verity of Colors: 10/10
Amount of Bricks in Perspective with Frequency: 7/10
Overall (not an average): 9/10 
Final Opinion: 
This set truly is great.  Whether you are a person just getting into Legos, and looking for bricks to start a collection, an enthusiast that needs more bricks to bulk up their collection, or a skilled builder (or an AFOL) who needs more bricks for a special project, you can’t go wrong with this set.  I mean we’re talking 650 pieces in 9 different colors for only $ 25.00 (USD)!

"brixton","2009-09-13T16:19:35.92Z","Perfect","This is perfect if you need actual bricks to build different things in your city.  An office tower or a few houses perhaps.  The red and yellow bricks can be used to build a small house.  There are plenty of these bricks for this purpose (more red than yellow).  I wish there were a few more black bricks in this set as I would have liked to use black to make the roof of a building.  Brown bricks can serve the same purpose but I would prefer to use those to build anything Earthy.  The possibilities are endless.  The different things you can build are limited only by your imagination (well maybe there are other limitations).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"IndyAJD","2011-02-23T14:02:25.093Z","Lots of Bricks, Low Price!","<p>Okay.&nbsp; Let me start out by saying that this set&nbsp;would be a&nbsp;great addition to&nbsp;any&nbsp;lego collection.&nbsp; It has 650 bricks for 30.00$ (USD)!&nbsp; Thats a great deal!&nbsp; With that amount of money you can probably buy a regular lego set with only 200-250 pieces!&nbsp; This is a must have as an addition to your sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It contains red, blue, green (light and dark),&nbsp; orange, white, and black pieces.&nbsp; It has more of the primary (red, blue, yellow) colors than the others.&nbsp; They are all mixed together in several bags.&nbsp; Its kind of fun to sort them, because whats the fun in having them pre-sorted?</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Has a good amount of bricks for the price. 
<li></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Could contain more black, brown, and white bricks, as I use these more often. 
<li></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I would highly recommend this set as a <strong>addition</strong> to any lego collection.&nbsp; I would not recommend this as a first set for a <strong>child, </strong>as they may want a regular set with more ""playability"" than this.&nbsp; But for someone who already has a few sets, this is a must have!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; If you mainly want 2 by 2s and 2 by 4s than you may be disappionted.</strong></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5
"Danielator36","2015-01-05T04:26:58.597Z","Nice set in general","<p>This set succeeds&nbsp;spectacularly in some aspects, and simply fails in others.</p>

<p>The design on the box is fairly nice. The parts included in the set are extremely great for building nice little structures. Sadly, there are no minifigures or an official build&nbsp;included in this set, which makes it lose playability. In all though, this set is great for people who need more bricks for their collection.</p>

"GamingXPLego","2015-11-07T13:44:13.793Z","More Bricks,But the white colour needs to have the 1x8s,2x6s and 2x8s and less 1x1s","<p>It is a very good set alright,I like on how it&#39;s cheap ($39.99) (It would&#39;ve been $69.99) and has&nbsp;alot of bricks,however,there are not many Bricks for White,Lime,Green and Brown</p>

<p>(I use white more often) The main bricks are Blue,Red and Yellow,which have 1x8s,2x6s and 2x8s.</p>

<p>On smaller Basic Brick sets,the White Bricks are the part of the main colours,meaning they have 1x8s,2x6s and 2x8s. Which is not fair,because for this set,they remove all the 1x8s,2x6s and 1x8s to put more 1x1s,in total in this set it has 132 1x1s,and only has 39 2x4s. The Large&nbsp;Basic Brick&nbsp;set only has 64 1x1s.</p>

<p>I would recommend this set only for building any animals,cars,etc But I&nbsp;would&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;smaller sets because they have less 1x1s&nbsp;and White becomes the main colour for smaller sets. And I would recomend&nbsp;smaller sets for those who don&#39;t like Brown. I build Lego Candy machines,and I use white for most of my machines,and I cannot use alot of 1x1s. So I would use smaller sets so I can get the 1x8s,2x6s,and 2x8s.</p>

"tommycarstensen","2018-07-01T15:48:13.137Z","Best value for money in the years 2008-2018","<p>This set (theme Bricks and More) was the best value for money in the years 2008-2018. It only contained bricks. They were in&nbsp;the classic colours&nbsp;(red, yellow, blue, white, black) and&nbsp;green, reddish brown, lime and orange. There has never since been a set that represented as good value for money. For example set&nbsp;10717 (theme Classic) of the year 2018 contains a lot of unwanted parts (cones, slopes, tiles, modified bricks, round plates, etc.). I hope there will be a set like 6177 in the future. There was probably a reason Rymdreglage used set 6177 for their music video:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpZpupMT1mc&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qsWFFuYZYI</p>
