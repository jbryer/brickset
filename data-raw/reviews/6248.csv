It features only one minifig (true, with a nice hat) and only one model that can be operated by the minifig - a very basic fork lift. The crane and the container ship are nice, but too small. I think this set comes slightly out of range of the Bricks and More series as usually you can fit a minifig in every (or in most of) vehicles and buildings you construct. The variety ot parts is not big and you get very few special parts (the long rope on the crane as the best one).<br>All in one - I wouldn't recommend this set unless you are a Bricks and More series collector like me or simply enjoy ships. Don't buy this as your first set, the payability is poor. If you already have other sets this can be a nice add-on but nothing more.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,2,2,3,2,2
