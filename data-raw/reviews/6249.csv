"Legobuilderguy","2008-06-01T02:17:12.733Z","Decent set","I got this set a couple of months ago for a couple of reasons. First off the mini figure is from the construction line which is one of my favorites in Lego City. Secondly there are some good elements in this set. You get some nice wheels and hubs, a pair of small tracks which is always nice. A dump truck bed, a dozer blade, and some doors. Not really a must have but for the elements and piece to cost ratio this is a winner. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:
-good variety of bricks
-minifig
-300 pieces for 19.99!
-all 3 pictured vehicles simultaneously and then some

Cons:
-Hmm...Oh,one mini fig

overall: great, but needs one more minifig.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"meyerc13","2009-11-17T00:30:12.043Z","Great set with lots of ideas!","This is a great set with lots of ideas, and one of the best values around.  You get a lot of bricks for the price, and some that are really useful for building construction vehicles.  You get some great wheels and tires, a dump bucket, a pair of treads, and a dozer blade.  You also get a 6 wide windshield, which is useful for making a lot of different trucks.

You get more bricks in the set than you'll need to build the vehicles pictured on the box.  You also get a lot of ideas in the instruction manual.  I personally like a bulldozer pictured in the book better than the loader pictured on the box.  That bulldozer along with the dump truck and roller pictured on the box haven't been taken apart since my son and I built them.  I may need to pick up another one of these sets to build some of the alternate models.

If you want to start a LEGO construction company, this is the first set you should get!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"yerdna","2010-12-09T14:43:12.847Z","Very nice basic set","This is a great set to start your city/building collection with. It offers an excellent value for&nbsp;the money, has lots of bricks. The best thing is that the set offers a great variety of bricks, including some that are usually found only in specialized city sets. The vehicles are quite detailed and realistic.&nbsp;Unfortunately there is only one minifig included.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",FALSE,4,4,5,5,4
