"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-28T15:41:34Z","Still Available from VELUX.com! (as of 1/22/05)...In other news, this is a fabulous set!","Just a quick note and a short review.

This set is still available cheap*(see below) from VELUX.com, so don't waste your money on Ebay or Bricklink just yet. I just received my order from VELUX today (1-28-05) at 2:01:53 (yeah, forgive me for all of my statistics, but that's the exact time). The shipping was lighting fast, especially for overseas delivery. I placed my order on Saturday the 22st, and it arrived to my doorstep on the Friday the 28th by DHL Express. (That's not even one week!) Now for the review...

Pro's:
-Good selection of parts (Has plenty of roof, a hairbrush(believe it or not), flowers, &quot;umbrella&quot; inverted dish, a flag, &quot;roof&quot; windows, and is one of the few sets that have the 6 pane door in blue.

-Plenty of extra pieces (has 7 extra 2x2 slope/roof bricks(at 45 degree angle), 2 extra 2x4 slope/roof bricks(at 45 degree angle), and 1 extra flower stem along with 2 extra flowers) these pieces are mostly for the alternative models (more about them later in the review).

-Has 6 idea pages for alternative models (including a &quot;snack bar&quot; sort of building and a little &quot;cottage&quot; type of house)

-Stickers! Yes this is a good thing, depending on what kind of person you are. In my opinion, the VELUX brand name is over-promoted. The male minifig is wearing a VELUX shirt and there is a VELUX flag. therefore I didn't put the stickers on the male minifig (the female has a printed white shirt with a collar and two pockets).

Cons:
-It should feature more rooms (the house only has a dining &quot;room&quot; inside and a dining area outside along with a upstairs bedroom with a one person(or minifigure) bed.

-Its over-promoted (see above, in the last thing mentioned in &quot;Pros&quot;)

(AND TOGETHER THE CONS MAKE A MINUS ONE) 10-1=9 or 9/10
Which is excellent on my standards with LEGO.

Overall a great set. One of the best sets on the market today!

*=Hey, and here's how to avoid those high prices on Ebay and Bricklink:

Follow these directions correctly and you'll be owning this set in no time.

1. Go to www.velux.com
2. Wait for the site to completely load. Then click on &quot;Go to VELUX International Site&quot;
3. After it loads, click &quot;Inspiration&quot; in the upper navigation.
4. After the page loads, you will see the LEGO house on the page. Beside it, there is the words &quot;Go to VELUX GIFT SHOP&quot; (click it).
5. BE PATIENT! The first time you visit, it will take a couple of second for it to load. Wait, wait, wait. After it COMPLETELY loads, click on the picture of the LEGO house.

10. Click the next/finish button and complete your order.

Wait 3-4 days to process your order and 3-7 days for delivery (by DHL Worldwide Express). It depends on the time of delivery. I live on the upper east coast, so it arrived within a week.

Hope everything works out for you when ordering, because this is really a great set to have.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-17T18:18:00Z","One of the few sets worth getting today","Bought this sealed on ebay at almost the same price it is available from VELUX.
It's a nice little house that gives me a home sweet home feeling whilst staring at it.
The lights inside the house resemble somewhat of a halogen spot which gives it a contemporary feel. I also like the parasol outside and the female minifig.

Now off to the cons: I would have appreciated a very small kitchen or bathroom and stairs that lead to the loft.
The alternate models really are pointless save the cottage which is quite picturesque.
Also, this set costs 25 euros at VELUX which is comparatively cheap for a set of this size.
Still an essential for every town setup as original LEGO houses are rare.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Heliatck","2019-11-02T22:53:01.297Z","80's Bungalow ","<h2>Velux Connection</h2>

<p>Lego has a long history of producing co-branded sets with various Danish companies. Examples of this are the well-known Maersk sets, but also the Vestas windmill and more obscure sets such as the Arla milk truck.</p>

<p>Apparently this was a promotional set which was available for sale on velux.com up until at least 2005 according to the previous Brickset reviews. It&#39;s unclear whether the set was ever offered for free with purchase of Velux windows or given out at fairs.</p>

<p>It should also be pointed out that this set is not the first Velux co-branded set. There is also a version of 6374 Holiday Home (1983 release), with Velux stickers. Though in the case of 1854, there is no non-Velux version of the set.</p>

<p>There are no printed Velux pieces in this set. Everything with &#39;Velux&#39; on it (even the minifigure), is a sticker. This is kind of a shame. At least having a Velux minifigure would have been nice.</p>

<h2>A Traditional 1980s House Released in 1996</h2>

<p>In the 1980s, the traditional Lego house was always a part of the Legoland lineup. This set is very comparable in style to some of those sets such as 6374 Holiday Home and 6349 Holiday Villa. It also fits well with 6379 Riding Stable, mostly because of the similar color scheme.</p>

<p>The big difference is that this set was released much later: 1996, a time where there were almost no traditional Lego houses being released anymore. That&#39;s not to say it doesn&#39;t go well together with sets of that time. It&#39;s just a shame that there weren&#39;t any more options available.</p>

<h2>Review of the House</h2>

<p>When looking at the actual set, it&#39;s quite basic. The house is mainly made up of white bricks for the walls and red tiles for the roof. There isn&#39;t much detail inside, but that has never been the case for these type of sets.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite a tiny building, but still manages to be slightly too big for the 16x16 baseplate. I feel that the house would have looked better on a 16x32 baseplate with some trees and a fence around it, but there&#39;s nothing stopping you from doing that.</p>

<p>Even so, the fact that the building is so small is not a bad thing. The sets I mentioned before like 6374 and 6349 are actually quite big (they&#39;re built on a 32x32 baseplate) and look way out of scale when you put them next to other town sets. They are almost the same size as a 6380 Hospital or 6389 Fire Control Center, which doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense when you think about it.</p>

<p>You get two minifigures in this set: a girl with a white shirt and red pants and a guy who is either supposed to be a Velux window installer or just a husband who happens to be a fan of Velux windows.</p>

<p>There is also an old school flag in this set, which was probably included because it just so happened to be produced again at the time for 6769 Fort Legoredo!</p>

<h2>Value for Money</h2>

<p>Despite what you might think, this set isn&#39;t particularly rare. You can readily find sealed copies online, which is usually not the case for 1996 sets. The difference between a sealed and a used copy is also quite small.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t pay much more than 50&euro; for this set, because there aren&#39;t any valuable pieces and the Velux stuff is just a sticker sheet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a nice little collectible though, which is mainly why I bought mine.</p>

<h2>Recommended Sets</h2>

<p>Other than the beforementioned sets, people who like this set might also want to check out Basic Building sets 710 and 725 which are very comparable in style, but not as well known. Pizza To Go and Breezeway Cafe have a similar color scheme as well.</p>
