Our first Bionicle. (bought for Son, but Dad's the real nerd for it)
I'm actually more impressed by this kit more than the Toa Mahri and Barraki we picked up after this one.
those are perhaps too poseable, they flop around a lot with so many joints that aren't very stiff.
Tanma's ball joints, at least this particular set, have a stronger grip and it holds his standing pose much better than the others we have.

"Gus_263","2008-02-22T15:13:22.967Z","Reasons for buy that playable set","Tanma, like all the other matoran of 2008 have few pieces, but costs expensive, for a set with only 14 pieces. This set can be expensive, but is also one of the most playable matoran ever created, with an good color scheme, mask and weapons. The transluscent head is not so awesome due to its color. An feature is the combination with the Lewa Nuva 2008 set, easily to play and &quot;team up&quot;. The mask and body, are really good designed. In Overall, Tanma gets 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-10T14:12:40.28Z","loads of new pieces","I got this for four quid in woolworths early this year. Tanma is really cool for a matoran.

pros:
jetpack
lots of new pieces
cool mask

cons:
green eyes

I think this set is really cool 4/5

you can combine it with Toa Lewa, Antroz and radiak to make Spiriah. If you want to get spiriah I'll just do a tiny review of him:

Makuta spiriah isn't a very good combo.

Pros:
cool Jutlin
cool wings
Midak skyblaster really fires
claw

Cons:
Bad colour scheme
lower body section is too wide
lower arm sections twist
green eyes

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T09:31:48.247Z","Best of the Av-Matoran","Okay, I know everyone who owns one of these are probably recoiling at my 5/5, but really, he earns it.  Sure he doesn't have many pieces (only 14!!) and sure he's expensive, but he's cool!  He connects to Lewa!  He's a good poser!!  Really, this guy is worth the $7.  Other than the two Cons above, I kinda wish he had red eyes or something, but that would make him look like a bad guy, so I guess I shouldn't have said that.  Pros and Cons:

Pros:

-He poses good

-Mask matches Lewa's perfectly

-Old Lewa's/Balta's katanas

-Great color scheme

Cons:

-Too few pieces

-A bit expensive

Even though he was pricy, I don't regret getting him.  Go get Tanma (and Gavla to fight) before he goes!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-10-15T23:48:19.293Z","Little green friend (no hes not Yoda)","Tanma was my first Karda Nui Bionicle and I was kinda so so about him. His arms and legs are only one piece which makes him kinda unposable. But then when Lewa came out and I put Tanma on his back it actually looked quite cool. So that's why Tanma gets a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

He can team up with Toa Ignika, Toa Lewa, Toa Kopaka, Toa Tahu, and Toa Gali. On boxes he teams up with Toa Gali or Toa Lewa. Tanma can actually team up with Toa Pohatu or Toa Onua, but he doesn't look right. Tanma is a Av-Le-Matoran. He is       lime-green and dark grey. He has two Air Katana just like Lewa Nuva. His Air Katana are silver. He also has a silver large jet-pack attached to his back. Tanma includes fourteen [14] pieces. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Tommy_60","2009-07-15T11:48:03.827Z","This little guy can pack a punch!","I bought Tanma last year and I have no regrets about it.  Despite the 14 pieces, this set can keep you occupied for hours.  Here are the pros and cons :

PROS (: 
New mask!
2 air katanas!
It can combime with Lewa or other Phantoka or Mistika!
Playability is great!

CONS ):             
Tanma's leg pieces can crack where they can hold a ball socket.  To make matters worse, you can't replace them on Lego.com!

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-23T10:11:39.9Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Matoran) - Tanma Review","This is a great little figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well. The arms, the legs, the feet, the hands and the head can be moved. On the back you can also see a jetpack. I really like the way how LEGO did the mask for Tanma. I also like the colors on him. This figure can be attached to set 8686 (Toa Lewa) as well. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"TangDynasty","2010-03-09T21:04:47.327Z","The Lego set that started it for us","<p>This set was our very first Lego. I was never into Lego till Christmas 2008 when my then 4 year old son got this set as a Christmas gift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started building it and I still remember clearly&nbsp;the experience.&nbsp;He had a tough time with the joints and I had to help him along. Besides that , it was an easy build. I must admit I did not expect anything out of it but I was impress with the final product. My son was also very taken with it and before long, we are collecting loads of Bionicle sets and then to the Star Wars ones.&nbsp;We kind of sad that Lego decided to end the Bionicle series but I guess they have their reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for the pros and cons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros </p>
<p>- Nice colour scheme</p>
<p>- Cool helmet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>- Can't really think of any as this is the one that started us on the Lego journey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to write more about my other Bionicle sets and also the Star Wars ones. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"thephantombohrok","2015-10-15T20:09:07.613Z","best matoran of 08","<p>This set was my first ever bionicle set and I remember it like it was yesterday, the Av-Matoran build is hated among many and liked by few.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The canister is cool for a set of this size it has nice little cave &nbsp;decals which&nbsp;make great cave scene things for MOCing,&nbsp;but its a canister its not why you got the set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This comes with very few parts 14 to be exact, but this is why I think this one is the best it has the ever awesome Lime green though lime green breaks easily it is still a really nice color to have. The mask&nbsp;that comes with Tanma is lime green also and great looking,he also comes with two of the same boring blades that TLG tends to use for the air element boring. The jet-pack piece is fairly cool and useful in its own right.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>none</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build shouldn&#39;t take longer than a minute really that&#39;s&nbsp;how easy it is it is quite easy and very dull, all&nbsp;it is snapping on the arms, legs, and head&nbsp;ect. All in all boring&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model by itself is nothing to look at twice but when put on the back of Lewa it looks incredible the pair do look rather awesome together and like they are ready for battle. In the end the original price was high for what it was, but now days you can find it on ebay for really cheap. I personally think this is the best matoran just because of the lime green, and the fact that his mask looks better than all the others.btw he is kinda cute</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>should you get this set? Yes and no, I would not just go out and buy this set alone I would find lewa first and then go buy this lill guy. The Av- Matoran build is dull but if you were to get any of them I woud get him just because he has great parts colors.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>-kinda cute</p>

<p>-cool mask</p>

<p>-good colors</p>

<p>-looks AWESOME with Lewa</p>

<p>-great part color</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>-really simplistic</p>

<p>-lime green parts break easy</p>

<p>-few parts for increased price</p>
