"Gus_263","2008-03-07T14:03:19.67Z","Light matoran","This have another parts, different arms and legs. The blades aren't very great, but with these arms that looks like vahki legs is very playable. He have a jetpack, like the another light matoran tanma and photok, also included on lewa. The head is too the same thing, don't very compatible in toa bodies. Solek can team up with any phantoka, but is more cool with kopaka than others.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-16T08:45:09.153Z","good jetpack","I think this set is realy good for 4 quid.

pros:
jetpack
lots of new pieces
cool mask
cool power swords
only 4 quid
cons:
when you fit him in a phantoka/mistika box his limbs could snap

I think this set is really cool 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"vezon8764","2008-10-11T12:38:02.153Z","Nice Matoran, but nothing special","I'm not saying that this is a bad set, but I only got it for four reasons: 1) My other Solek was broken. 2) Other than Mazeka, this is the only set that you can get these arm pieces. 3) Jetpack. 4) I needed him to go with Kopaka.
Pros:
Jetpack!
Rare arm pieces
Cons:
Breaks easily
See you next review!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"james3426","2009-10-29T19:38:51.263Z","The Toa-Crazed Av-Matoran","Solek Is my favorite 2008 Matoran that I have. (It would probably be Gavla if I had her) I like these Matoran more than the Agori for some reason. His tools or others would call weapons, are called power swords and are not rare, but they look good on him. His mask, I recently found out was a noble Akaku, (No wonder it resembles Kopaka's) and I love it! His jet pack is in a few other sets now, but like the power swords, they look good on him. Even though the design is not complex, I do not really care because, everything else ""drowns"" that out.

pros:
Power Swords are cool.
Jet pack.
Noble Kanohi Akaku.
Head.

cons:
None

This is a great Matoran. Get him with Kopaka if you can.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"modena","2010-11-20T16:09:10.987Z","Broken again.","This was such a nice set, but: When the arms broke, I had to order new ones from&nbsp;Lego, and they gave me green ones from the 8944.<h4>Pros:</h4><div><ul><li>Great colours!</li><li>Compatible with 8685!</li><li>Nice weapons!</li><li>Rare jetpack!</li></ul></div><h4>Cons:</h4><div><ul><li>Parts break easily.</li><li>Lego keeps sending me the wrong part, twice now.</li></ul></div><h4>Overall:</h4><p>The set was nice from the beginning, but these arms are so fragile, and I got quite disappointed that they are also found on the 7137. Overall, if you want to use these 14 bricks for something else, then this is a nice set. It does look nice on the back of the 8685.</p><p>This is then a nice set, but the parts will break unless you keep it on display.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,2,3,4,3
"tkettle9719","2012-01-01T22:18:05.963Z","Flight of the Matoran!","<p>I got this set at Toys 'R Us (where the government has put a tax on everything bought from there, it seems), and like the little guy, though I find him to be an odd pair-up with the new Tahu.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The new jetpack piece is a nice detail, and looks just right.<br></li><li>-Gray and white are also a nice pairing of colors.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The arm and leg pieces are not my favorite little detail ever, and make little Solek look fat {:(} (nice goatee)<br></li><li>-The green eyepieces also seem a bit out-of-place here, since the eyes for ice Bionicle are usually light blue.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a great little Matoran for the collection, and has many nice little pieces for MOCs. I recommend it, but get it with the new Kopaka. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
