My title says it all. All I will write is a pro and con list, hopefully then you we see.


          Pros: Color, mask and chronicler staffs.
          Cons: Stupid arms and feet, 14 pieces, goofy look.


          Stay away from the matoran of light unless you have a toa.
           6 dollars is too much for 14 pieces.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-07T14:29:48.95Z","Warrior of the air","This small set, the matoran photok, is a great addition to the theme. The color is a different, replace the yellow but will be replaced again, by yellow again(the brown, one of the six main bionicle colors was replaced by yellow). The subtheme of matorans, were different in years previously, from 2006 and 2007 had also hydruka sets, and were smaller, but with great weapons, and more useful, made with different forms, and same masks of previous set, sometimes the same but painted different. In 2008 was released the matorans of this subtheme, with more playable legs and arms, but for the body shapes the head were also made different, don't being very compatible with some newer bionicles, and being completly transluscent it turns more strange, only if in the size of these matorans that don't. This set, photok, have different size, with stronger arms and weaker legs, with a smaller shape of body. A jetpack is included, same of the others matorans and toa lewa nuva, making looks like that these can fly. The blades were previously used, and aren't big, but still in a good size to a weapon in little arms or in a little set. The mask is well made, and the hands and feet pieces have a little difference with the olders. This matoran can team up with the toas or makuta, this specially with pohatu nuva because have the same colors, orange and gray. It have 14 pieces and is more playable than some matoran. Matorans of 2007 had 37 pieces and were more cheap, but the matorans of 2008 are more expensive having only 14 pieces. Overall, only the price isn't good in this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-06T00:51:13.623Z","Orange Matoran","Photok is a really good Matoran. The mask looks like Pohatu Phantoka's. And seeing as I like Pohatu Phantoka, its cool.

Photok is a really great buy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-23T10:17:03.313Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Matoran) - Photok Review","This is a cool little figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The legs, the feet, the arms, the hands and the head can be moved. On the back you can see a jetpack. I like the design of Photok's mask and I also like the colors on him. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
