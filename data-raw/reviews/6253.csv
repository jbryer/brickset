This set is almost entirely made of new pieces including, new limbs, head, and torso. It is made up of very few pieces but the building experience is still great. I give this set a 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"greg_duncan","2007-12-26T13:43:06.34Z","WAAAAAAY too simple","I was pretty disappointed with this set. It was the first set I opened from 2008, and took me 15 seconds to build without the instructions. You see, this the first bionicle set since the mctoran that failed to include any small pieces at all. No small pins, axles, or anything that could pose a choking threat to small children. It is, unfortunately, a kids set. It does look good, though, and includes useful parts, like the tools and the mask and the wings. The single thing that ruined this set and indeed the other 2008 sets for me is the sockets, and on this set it would be the hands. They are newer and a different style which is plain that I don't like. In all, I don't really recommend this set over the matoran just because the build is made for younger kids and the look of the finished product isn't as good as the matoran. Oh well, maybe we'll get some better ones next year.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-08T19:30:33.39Z","Boring as Always","I never liked Bionicle at all. After 6 years, this theme is still going. It's just a bunch of random creatures Lego makes and what most people do is take it apart. This Matoran is too simple and should have more pieces in this set. It isn't that good at all. This is really bad and no one should pick it up.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-05T13:32:55.59Z","Good shadow matoran set","This set is one of the shadow matorans in the bioicle theme, releaed in this year. Different from some other matorans in the bionicle theme released early (2001 to 2007), the new have few pieces, 14 to 16. But altough these have few pieces and are more expensive, this is because the new are bigger and in relation with some other matorans, are more playable. With solid pieces, Radiak have four paws, each one are builted with the same pieces, except for the blades, the blades of the front are more tall. The Radiak's body is big for a matoran and makes the set more playable with the good positioned joints. The head have a orange color with translucsent effect. The color is not the best for it, but the design still cool. The head don't need more pieces to be connected with the joint, that is a bad thing to make creations with it, because the toa and makuta have another head type, but it still good for the matoran. The mask is too nicely designed and looks like the antroz's mask in a minor version. The wings on the back aren't playable but makes another cool effect or the design. Dofferent from some other shadow mtorans, the Radiak's wings are good positioned. The playability is good and this set like some other matorans, can &quot;team up&quot; with a makuta or toa Phantoka. The best for Radiak &quot;team up&quot; is Antroz. Altough the head can't be fixed well on some other bionicle sets, it still good designed and is good for matorans. The color scheme, like the Antroz colors (black, red and with some silver things, like the blades), and combined with a nice design makes it better. The matoran of 2008 not involves much building and isn't cheap for 14 pieces, but still a cool option to increase your bioicle collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-16T08:09:27.373Z","First four-legged Matoran","Very cool for a Matoran.  It is like a small Phantoka.

pros:
wings
lots of new pieces
cool mask

cons:
none

I think this set is really cool 5/5

you can combine it with Toa Lewa, Antroz and Tanma to make Spiriah. If you want to get spiriah I'll just do a tiny review of him:

Makuta spiriah isn't a very good combo.

Pros:
cool Jutlin
cool wings
Midak skyblaster really fires
claw

Cons:
Bad colour scheme
lower body section is too wide
lower arm sections twist
green eyes",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-29T20:17:58.17Z","Never let Mutran ""study"" you.","Confused? In the story, Mutran was moody the day Radiak, Gavla and Kirop were turned into shadow Matoran, so he mutated them into nightmarish things. Radiak was turned into a quadruped creep with razor-sharp feet and wings. 

Like all Shadow Matoran, he has a blended mask, which I recently found out is a Noble Jutlin.(Antroz's mask, except not ""great"")  One thing unusual about him that no other Shadow Matoran have are, rather than vicious-looking claws, he has bladed feet. He is rather pose-able compared to the smaller sets from 2001(Turaga)-2005(Rahaga). But I think the 2007 Matoran were the best. (You may have noticed I don't have one, but I have built some from my collection)

pros:
Wings
Bladed feet.
Noble Kanohi Jutlin.
Head
Has an evil look

cons:
none

He is one of two exceptions for my dislike for quadruped Bionicle sets, the other being Zesk. He is my favorite Shadow Matoran and my second favorite 2008 Matoran.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-24T10:04:45.877Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Matoran) - Radiak Review","This is a cool figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved. On his back you can see some nice looking wings. You can also attach this figure to set 8989 (Toa Tahu). As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Squidtron","2010-01-01T22:50:31.043Z","What does everyone have against Radiak?","Yes I know, he is simple. But who cares, he's awesome all the way! He's got a simple structer but he looks awesome and has some cool parts (infact all of the are cool but 1!). The only 1 that isn't good is the Body or base part. If you hold the head up to light the eyes light up (This is'nt really featured, but because his head is translucent it works). 

Well that's his description now for the Cool/Not Cool things about this set.
Looks Awesome and evil(+2)
Cool Parts(+1)
Combines with Antroz(+1)
Though his elbows can't move he is still posable(+1)*
Few Parts(-1)
AND THE GRAND TOTAL IS... 4/5 nice little set.

By the way to you mister hustla187 Bionicles aren't random or boring at all, they haved the most distinct storyline of any LeGO theme so far (there are even books and movies about it).

*The pose in the picture is impossible, but he ramains highly posable.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
