"Gus_263","2008-03-07T13:57:20.543Z","Good for a shadow matoran","Gavla acts as the eyes of blinded vamprah. If you have vamprah you can choose gavla to team-up. Gavla don't likes a female figure, it's face is strange. The head is the same of another 08' shadow matoran, and it isn't very compatible with some bodies of bionicle. Her body is little , to team-up with vamprah, that don't have great legs. The black colors are cool, in the feet and body, well designed. And the weapons are two parts that can make a carapar's claws.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

 So I give this set

"legoguy2805","2008-09-09T13:25:33.187Z","Gavla, the leader of the Shadow Matoran","This is Gavla, the leader of the Shadow Matoran. She was once an Av-Matoran (Matoran of Light), until Chirox drained the light out of her with a Shadow Leech. Mutran later mutated her into her current form. When Vamprah was blinded by the Ignika, he chose Gavla to act as his eyes.

Enough of the storyline, let's get onto the pros and cons:

Pros:
Good colour scheme
Stands up well
Exclusive Mask
Can connect to Vamprah
Many new pieces

Cons:
Wings look out of place
The blades are a bit too big

Overall, a good addition to a collection, 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-16T09:46:53.543Z","Cool mask","This is a great set but I think it's mask is the coolest mask out of all the Matoran of Light.

I think this set is really cool 4/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T09:38:25.983Z","Another Good 'Un","Gavla is a great partner for Vamprah, and I never regret getting her.  She is very VERY fun to pose fighting Tanma, as her swords are very long and curved.  The only problem with my Gavla is that I should switch out her red eyes for green ones, as Takanuva healed all the Shadow Matoran.  Oh well.  Here's the Pros:

Pros:

-Long, curved swords

-Poses are neat!

-Evil-looking mask, wings, and feet

-Color scheme matches Vamprah to perfection

-Mask matches Vamprah's mask, too

Cons:

None!

So go get Gavla (and Vamprah if you don''t already have him) and have fun posing and playing!  Happy collecting!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-02-18T09:42:05.81Z","Gavla","I used to think that she was called Galva but I guess it's Gavla.

She has really cool claw blades.

Her mask makes her look like a wolf.

She was worth the seven dollars, I think.

Gavla was the first matoran to have the light drained out of her, leaving her a 

Shadow Matoran, a twisted ally of the evil Makuta.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"J6Crash","2011-09-08T17:21:57.363Z","Thankfully I didn't pay for it","<p>There really isn't all that much to review here. You get 14 pieces for $7. I paid that much for the Toa Mata which had more twice the number of pieces as well as the gear functions and pretty colors. Looking past the issue of price, the mask is pretty good. The wings I'm not much of a fan of, and the swords might be nice if you don't have any yet. The rest is a one piece body, one piece limbs, and a set of feet and hands. The lack of knees and elbows really hurts this set as it hurts all av-Matoran builds.</p><p>I don't see much else to talk about so I'm going to leave it at: don't pay more than $3 for this set.<br></p>",TRUE,2,2,1,3,1
