"Gus_263","2008-04-03T13:33:26.483Z","Cool shadow matoran","This is one of the matorans released in 2008. Kirop, like all the other matorans of this year, have some new pieces like the body, mask, arms, legs and the new translucent head. Altough the few 14 pieces are no much for the price, it is a good option to buy playable bionicle sets for a cheap price, because these matoran are bigger than the previous released and the pieces too. The kirop's feet are the same of the makuta phantoka Chirox, are claws like the piraka but with two &quot;fingers&quot; (not exactly fingers, these don't moves). The legs are in a good size for it and the body also. The arms are so long due to the blades be short. Altough the blades are short and incurved, these are in a good size and are playable, to makes it better, only moves the &quot;hand&quot; of the matoran to another side and plays with it. The translucent head is good designed but the color is not much cool and too the playability of the head in other bionicle sets, altough the head shape is goog for these matorans. The wings on the Kirop's back are too nicely and simple, but are in a bad position. The mask have  an awesome color scheme and design, looks like a short version of the Chirox's mask. Overall, the set is good, with some useful pieces (the head don't works very well for other bionicle sets, except for the matorans of this year), an awesome color scheme, design, simple building, cool to play with (this is most playable than some other matoran) and it also have the capacity to &quot;team up&quot; with other phantoka, it is better with Chirox. I rate Kirop 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"kibble123456789","2009-07-26T12:07:19.467Z","Kirop the bat bionicle!","He is interesting when I got him I thought he would have much more parts then he did (my first 7$ set:P) but he still is pretty cool.  Here are the pros and cons.

pros 
cool weapons 
awesome mask
cool bat wings 
different feet 

cons 
shoulders are taller then his head 
arms and legs are one piece
his body is one piece 
overpriced (biggest factor)


Overall he would be worth it if he was 5$ if not I wouldn't waste your money also don't but him just because on the back of Cricka is says they go together (that's why i bought him)

"Alemas","2009-09-01T07:51:29.903Z","A (very) late addition to my collection!","When this set first came out, I wanted it and all the other Matoran. I got all the others, but when Christmas came, we didn't find this! Cue searches on Ebay and Amazon, until finally, as a surprise, my parents gave me this, still sealed, and direct from Amazon UK! Now I finally completed the 2008 Matoran collection! Onto the review: This Matoran has standard 2008/2009 Matoran/Agori parts. The main body has shoulders which are raised, giving Kirop a slightly ""hunchback"" look. This set can attach itself to any Toa or Makuta of 2008. Its big con is that the arms and legs are fixed, which limits posability a lot! Onto the pros and cons:

Pros:

Evil-looking
Nice claws
Good wings

Cons:

Fixed arms and legs
""Hunchback"" look

Overall, a good set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-29T20:59:51.763Z","Evil-looking contest for Kirop, and Radiak:Tied!","I cannot decide who looks more evil. Radiak's mask looks creepier than Kirop's and he is quadruped, but Kirop is hunched-backed and his eyeholes on his mask make him look even more evil somehow! On to the review.

     Kirop's claw blades are not too rare, but like some other sets, I think they look good on him. His mask, which I found out is a Noble Shelek, is awesome! It can be used in an MOC with some kind of actual hand-claw, and it might even scare me, and I am a teenager! The entire arms and legs are exactly opposite in color. (ex. arms are the same color as feet, and ""hands"" are same color as legs.
Note: The picture is slightly affected due to lights shining off him.

pros:
Clawed feet.
Claw blades.
Noble Kanohi Shelek.
Wings.

Cons:
None that I see.

I cannot decide who my favorite Shadow Matoran is, excluding Vutraz. I recommend Kirop .",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-24T10:09:28.033Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Matoran) - Kirop Review","This is a cool little figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The arms, the hands, the legs, the claws and the head can be moved. The back has a nice looking wing piece as well. I also like the design of his mask. This figure can be attached to set 8690 (Toa Onua) as well. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
