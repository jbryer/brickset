Pros:

Midak Skyblaster is better to use than the zamor launcher,squid launcher etc...

Good at posing.

The wings are very good on him.

Mask is intresting but the...(check the cons)

Has some new pieces for MOC.


Cons:

When the Midak Skyblaster is connected to the other hand...it makes kopaka less poseable and heavier.

The lightsaber eye is cool but WAAAAAAAAAY too long.

Kopaka could have had the Midak Skyblaster and a other weapon but no...



Overall:Good set though cons might affect the buy...but if you really like him or need some new pieces than this is the guy!

"water_jedi_17","2008-04-08T21:48:46.467Z","Toa Nuva of Ice","Kopaka is one of my more favorite sets from phantoka.He has two long wings and has two lightsaber pieces for his mask and bayonet. Speaking of that I was dissapointed that Kopaka's weapon was connected to his skyblaster.He should come with a sheild or sword at least.Also i hate how he needs both of his arms for the skyblaster. On the other hand, I was very impressed with the skyblaster and is very fun to play with.You should definately buy Kopaka.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-12T16:02:46.937Z","Toa Kopaka battling at the skies","Kopaka's legs and arms are all the same, these were used in the subtheme Piraka, and are useful, to toas or makuta, have a well designed shape and are in a regular size. The feet and the armor were from the toa inika subtheme, these are also compatible with this body shape. The Toa Kopaka set was very resized, his last set was more little and had gear systems, this don't have that and still playable, another changes were the mask, with the don't symetrical eye with the laser piece in other side of the mask and the weapons, now one little blizzard blade with the midak skyblaster. His equipments for flight are wings, don't natural ones like of the makuta, but another in silver color that looks like be more mechanical. The weapon is great to play with because he hangs this on it's back, and in the front he can put the blade and also the another hand. This is a playable action figure that still with lego pieces, these are useful to another themes also, like to technic, due to have common pieces. Is cool if combined with the matoran solek, turning greater the playability.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DarthVader_","2008-03-27T13:03:03.733Z","Cool set!","I like this set alot, and it is one of my newer ones!  I bought it before Christmas and I liked it alot!  I got the matoran for Christmas!  They are really cool combined!  His weapon is kinda like the Toa Inika's weapon.  Besides that, the product is pretty musch original!  I like this product alot!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Aleiobot","2008-12-28T20:31:43.89Z","Icey Cool!","This set is great and all, but there are a few cons I found in him. Kopaka is my latest Phantoka (along with Chirox), who completes my first half of the 2008 year  collection. I found him cool but a bit annoying. Below are pros and cons for him.

Pros:
One of the coolest masks I've seen.
sweet Ice bayonet
overall cool design

Cons:
 not well movable arms with midak skyblaster in both hands
not as cool overall as some other Bionicles

             can team up with Solek

"vezon8764","2008-09-28T16:18:30.17Z","What is it with these new pieces?","The pieces that connect the arms and body together have little cuts in them, so that if you bend them too hard: SNAP! That is what happened to my brother and Vamprah, and I intend to not let that happen to my guys, already having broken Toa Ignika. Well, back to the set, I had the original Toa Kopaka from 2001, and I still do, but as it is, the new Kopaka is better than back then, with more movable body pieces.
Pros:
New wings
New eyepiece
Midak Skyblaster, with bayonet
New Mask of Vision
Cons:
Not very posable when both hands are attached to blaster.
Armor pieces come off easily.

Kopaka is really cool because of his mask, his feet, and of course his wings are all awesome!

[this is my brother's]

this set was worth the 12 bucks, in my opinion

"modena","2011-01-04T12:07:21.28Z","Great wings!","<p>I bought this set together with the 8945, and I became pretty surprised!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Wings!</li><li>Midak Skyblaster really fires!</li><li>Midak Skyblaster&nbsp;can hold 4 balls!</li><li>Includes a blade attached to the&nbsp;Midak Skyblaster!</li><li>Nice mask!</li><li>Set contains two ""lasers""!</li><li>Wings can rotate!</li><li>The&nbsp;figure looks&nbsp;graceful!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Does not combine with the 8945 (you just attach it)!</li><li>Not much building, but not bad either.</li><li>Plates fall off sometimes.</li><li>Midak Skyblaster can also fall off.</li></ul>
<h4>Overall:</h4><p>I spent a lot of time choosing it from the&nbsp;catalogue, and it got chosen mostly because of the wings and the blade on the&nbsp;Midak Skyblaster.&nbsp;The first thing that startled me was that rather than combining it with the 8945, al you do is attach them together with a little grey brick! In the instructions, it tells you to let both his hands hold the&nbsp;Midak Skyblaster. This makes it&nbsp;impossible for&nbsp;him to get a&nbsp;sword, unless you take the&nbsp;Midak Skyblaster and put it on one hand, and then you place a blade from the 8434. Originally, Kopaka looks very graceful and handsome when he poses. You'll see that when you get him. What strikes me when I play, is that the plates on the arms fall off under pressure. The&nbsp;Midak Skyblaster also falls off when you Kopaka holds it with one arm, even if you try with black&nbsp;cross-axles. Finally, I'll say that the set gives you two red lasers, which are great for making your own Lightsabers&nbsp;(for Star Wars).</p><p>Overall,&nbsp;I don't think I need to say more!, and&nbsp;I can easily say that its worth getting this set! really&nbsp;recommended!</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,3
