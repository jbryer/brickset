"Gus_263","2008-02-24T10:49:14.64Z","Warrior of the air","Lewa is back with an new armor in 2008. His new color is awesome but i like more the old green color. The gray color is also an new color for him, but he is so much gray. His lime green pieces uses an new plastic, like all the Phantoka, making the pieces more strong. His mask looks like the Lesovikk's mask, but is better with some designs and size. The Midak blaster is another feature and shoots easily but is heavy for some sets. His saber is the best weapon for green new bionicles, and his pieces on his arm&#180;s top can be used easily to make an warrior of the air, due to it looks like some jetpacks. An great feature is the possibility to &quot;team up&quot; with the Matoran Tanma set, in a simple and good system. I rate Lewa Phantoka 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Aleiobot","2008-12-28T20:22:06.653Z","Didn't get the original, but I got the new!","I don't have the original Toa Lewa, but I got the new one! I've almost completed my 2008 collection and this is definitely one of the coolest Toa! The double jet packs and shoulder blades are interestingly cool features. His sword is massive and possibly the coolest sword design I've seen on Bionicles. If you don't own this set, you must have it before they're gone! Below are some pros. Sorry, but there are no cons!

Pros: cool new 2008 pieces
        midak skyblaster that really fires
        matoran can ride on Lewa's back!

pros:
jetpacks

cons:
green eyes

I think this set is really cool 4/5

you can combine it with Toa Lewa, Antroz and Tanma to make Spiriah. If you want to get spiriah I'll just do a tiny review of him:

Makuta spiriah isn't a very good combo.

cool Jutlin
cool wings

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-25T08:56:05.2Z","He's dangerously close to being my favorite Phantoka...","But no, Vamprah definitely takes first.  But, I mean, c'mon!  Second place is nice!!
Toa Lewa is totally new in this new version, and the new features are amazing.  I love, just absolutely DIG, those jetpacks on his shoulders, and I like how he joins up with Tanma.  His sword is big and really dangerous-looking, and the Midak Skyblaster is nice, too, shooting SILVER Zamors!  My only complaint is that his feet kinda look buggy (Karzahni has the same type).

Pros:

JETPACKS!!

Midak Skyblaster is new and good

Sword looks dangerous (even has some lightning zapping around inside!)

He's HUGE!!  (compared to the old one)

Mask of Levitation is cool looking

Cons:

Feet look &quot;buggy&quot;

Go get Toa Lewa before he's gone!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Awesome mask
Midak Sky-blaster is AWESOME!
Jets on side of arms
Sweet sword
Cool chest plate
Tall
Can team up with Tanma for even more awesomeness

Cons:
Grey not silver
Hooks on arms limit posability ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"knuclear200x","2009-02-17T02:08:14.95Z","My First True-Love...Bionicle","I first saw this on display at a Lego retail store. I had to get this guy:

Pros:
Look at that helmet. I think this is the first and only one I've seen that doesn't have ""angry eyes"" and it's wide-eyes certainly does attract. Other awesome features include the spike-jetpack-shoulders and the green/gray color combo is good too. And instead of some specific action-feature, it just comes with a sword. Personally, I haven't grown very fond of action features from previous lines as they sometimes affect poseability and appearance.

Cons:
The shoulder-spikes get in the way of the arm poseability a little. And...well...that's it.

Overall:
With only one minor flaw, cool weapons and accessories this is truly a Bionicle worth picking for ten bucks (plus tax). ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

*Sleek Body

*Great Mask-Good eyecolor/mask cordnation
*Ausome Sorwd

Cons:

"smasher","2011-01-08T21:09:31.833Z","The Awesome Toa Of Air!","Toa Lewa Nuva(Adaptive Armor) is one of the most awesome sets of 2008. He has a long electrifying sword along with two rocket boosters on his arms. I must complain that his legs are extremely thin. The Midak Skyblaster is not really such a big deal as his arms support its weight. Combined with Tanma is much better for playability.

Lewu and Malum are my favorite though. This idea was a great one. I really like lewus sword and the blaster fires strongly. (Note: Don't fire it at yourself it hurts!)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We enjoyed building it and some of the parts were nice. He is tall compare to the other Bionicle and for us, he is perhaps the best amongst the Phantoka series.</p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-17T10:47:36.637Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Phantoka) - Toa Lewa Review","This is a cool figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers. The arms, the legs, the feet, the hands and the head can sviwel and on one hand you can see a cool looking sword and on the other hand you can see a cool cannon. You're able to put in 4 balls into the cannon and it shoots very well. On each shoulder you can also find a jet-pack which is always a great piece to have. I also like the lime green colors on Lewa. On his back you can see a piece which is able to attach a matoran figure from this theme (for example: set 8944 - Tanma). As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
