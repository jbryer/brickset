Pros:lots of new pieces
Cool propellers that really spin 
Awesome mask!
Midak Skyblaster that shoots really far! Better than Zamor launcher!

Cons:kind of hard to control when playing with him

Overall, I would give this set a 4 out of 5 rating. If you love Bionicles you have to get this set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-13T20:03:35.093Z","my new favorite bionicle","this guy rocks. his gun is realy cool, it can fit four balls in it and you pull back the lever and it shoots very acuratly and is the best gun yet. the mask is realy cool, its the only one i know of that doesnt cover the whole head, it looks realy cool. the heads havnt changed, and theres no new peices on the body. the arms however have realy weird pecis so that a tachnic pole can go through them and when you twist the back the claws open up into proppelers which spin realy well. the feet are pretty cool, but there nothing new. the upper legs and arms have weird coverings, i dont know if there new or not, but i like them, and there in an orange colour which looks good on him. this is a realy good bionicle, theres realy no bad things and somthing i forgot to mention: on his back he has a peice which i think is to attach the little guy onto him.

"CyandraZ","2008-05-03T14:54:07.42Z","The best of the Phantoka","The Phantoka have started off 2008 with a bang, featuring amazing villian designs, masks for both villians and heroes, and a unique release schedule that pairs three villians up with three heroes every 6 months.

Pohatu Nuva is really a breath of fresh air amid the increasingly repetitive toa designs. One look at him and you know he's special. For one thing, his color scheme - while not anything like his original scheme - is extremely striking, with a ton of dark grey accented by bright orange armor. His weapons are also amazing: two giant propellers that offer both a return to functions in bionicle sets and some incredible uniqueness among the endless swords and claws. 

Pohatu as a set is fairly standard but offers some interesting design. His wide shoulders, short limbs, and unusual body design fit a Toa of stone perfectly. His mask also is interesting - a lower, vahi like half with a trans-blue visor for the upper half. However, despite the aparrent similarities to the mask of time, Pohatu's new mask really seems like a new version of his original Kakama - which is exactly what it needed to do, and what his first Nuva mask failed to do.

If you're a MOC'er, Pohatu also offers a lot. Besides the orange armor, feet, and mask, the unique pieces in his propellers also will be very useful, as will the grey body pieces. The only real flaw Pohatu Nuva has as a set is the awkward midak placement - a weapon that big just looks too clumsy in that position.

When it all boils down, Pohatu is wonderful as both a set and a parts pack. Whether you plan on picking up just one Phantoka or all 6, I highly recomend Pohatu Nuva. 10/10

WARNING: The new joints used in the 2008 bionicle kits are different than the ones used in the previous seven years. Whatever kit you purchase, heavy usage of the joints may cause some to break due to the new design, which seems weaker. Buy at your own discression.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-05-03T17:09:49.013Z","New Version for the Toa Nuva of stone","This set is one more of the Phantoka subtheme, from Bionicle. Pohatu Nuva is the Toa Nuva of stone of the year of 2008. Currently, there is not an exactly color for the stone element, so, Pohatu features some gray scheme, like all the Toa Nuva Phantoka, and an odd orange scheme (really, in comparison with the first and second Pohatu released, this looks like odd, but still cool).

This set, like the other Phantoka, don't features much innovations with the building, and is easy to build. The most notable difference on the building are the propellers, on each arms, connected by sticks, through gray pieces, the arms. These works well, and are easy to spin, also to play with without dismantle, because are fixed by pieces on the elbow. The silver propellers are small, but well designed, and cool to play with. The Pohatu's body is made like the Kongu Mahri's body is, combining some parts of the hordika's arms, to connect the arms, and make the shoulders. The arms are increased by the armors firstly released with the piraka, making it looks like more stronger, due to the designs of the orange armors. The legs are also, basically the same of Kongu Mahri, but with different armors and feet. The armors increasing the legs are the same on the arms, and the feet are the same of Jaller Mahri, firstly released with some of the Toa Inika.

This version of Pohatu Nuva isn't much tall in comparison with other of the Toa Phantoka, released currently, but this still cool, and with a great playability. As a Toa Nuva Phantoka, this set too includes a Midak Skyblaster, that launches the same spheres from the Zamor sphere launchers, released in 2006. The Midak skyblasters are well designed, and are black and silver, making it combines with all the toa. These weapons shots very fast, easily and well, but makes more weight and are large, altough aren't much longer than the cordak blasters, released yesteryear.

This set includes a Midak Skyblaster, putted on the shoulder of Pohatu. Pohatu's mask is a adapted Kakama Nuva, as the bionicle storyline says, but it looks like more a Vahi mask, of time, that makes an odd effect. Altough this mask looks like to be half made, it is increased by a blue visor, like Lewa in Phantoka version and some the Toa Mahri.

Like all the other Phantoka, Pohatu can &quot;team up&quot; with any 2008 matoran, but the best option to make it with him is Photok, the orange matoran of light. Increasing the playabilitry, these new matorans make a cool effect on the colors (the same of the Phantoka), and with some pieces included with the Phantoka, the matorans can be attached easily with the Phantoka, making the playability better in some aspects, but not at all, due to the weight.

Overall, this set, a new version of Pohatu, bring few innovations and also, an odd orange color and mask, but the playability is maybe the better of all the Bionicle sets from the Phantoka. If you can get this set, get it and you will not be disappointed. In compariosn with the current bionicle sets, it is a good addition, and gets a 4.6 of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-09-10T13:44:00.483Z","Pohatu Nuva, the famous Toa of Stone","At first sight, some people might say: &quot;What the heck is that? That isn't Pohatu!&quot; Well, let me explain: After the Toa Nuva were teleported to the island of Artahka (The ruler is called Artahka too), Artahka gave the Toa Nuva Adaptive Armour and teleported them to Karda Nui. The Adaptive Armour adapted to an air enviroment, which is why the Nuva look different. Onto the Pros and cons:

Pros:
Air-Adapted Kanohi Kakama Nuva, Mask of Speed
Cool Propellers
The first orange Toa
Photok can connect to him
Stands up well

Cons:
Only 7 orange bits (Too much grey)
Hunchback

His han propelers are one of the coolest things about him. He has nice mask and cool body. I dont like how easly his propelers close. I dont like his name eather but then again I never liked any of the bionicles names. there so hard to prononce.But all in all this is a cool set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-10-17T16:37:39.263Z","Helicopter","When I picked up Pohatu off the shelves, I admit that I had my doubts about an orange Bionicle. But, as I built him, these doubts disintergrated. Pros and cons:

Pros:
Orange
Helicopter hands
Short
Midak skyblaster is great

Cons:
Maybe a little more orange

Other than that, Pohatu is a must have for all Bionicle fans. And helicopter fans!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"knuclear200x","2009-02-17T01:37:56.733Z","Propellers?! I thought those were claws!","I must confess: I really did think they were claws. Though I wasn't too disappointed after finding out.

Pros:
The colors are a nice combination. Coolest parts of this figure are the shoulder cannon, feet, and the fore arms. You can also spin the propellers by spinning the section by in its elbows. It's a neat feature as that part isn't tightened so go crazy with it.

Cons:
He's is a little dull in the helmet department. And the idea of having propellers for hands is kinda weird. There are things that make it look good but not much that I can think of.

Overall:
I wouldn't recommend getting this as a first set. Better to get it after you have a few extra Bionicle pieces and connectors lying around. It does have potential for many good customization options like, different claws, or an extra shoulder cannon or other weapon. Unless you like what you're seeing right now, of course.

One thing that has usually been good it the difference in body structure.<div><br></div><div>This latest version of Pohatu is by far the best yet. He has a cleverly designed mask that not only makes great use of the visor (unlike previous toa where it has been used merely as windscreens for the eyes) but closely resembles his toa mata mask, a tradition only reserved for Kopaka. His weapons cleverly change from a mode of transport to an element appropriate weapon, this gives the only drawback, no hands, although MOCing these is not an issue.</div><div>At last colour, although with dark grey,but I happen to like these phantoka schemes a lot.

There have been comments about his arms being to long, but, they theoretically have engines within them to power the propellers so I think they are fine in fact their great!</div><div><br></div><div>All in all a fantastic set and my favourite bionicle figure of all, end of.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-17T10:39:40.57Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Phantoka) - Toa Pohatu Review","This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers. The arms, the legs, the feet, the hands and the head can be moved. The cannon does sviwel as well and you can put 4 balls in it. You're also able to shoot the cannon and this weapon works very well. I also like Pohatu's propellers on each hand. Both propellers sviwel full 360°. On the back you can also see a piece which you can use to add a matoran figure from this theme (for example: set 8946 - Photok). I also like the gray and orange color on him but I think that Pohatu would have looked better if LEGO used brown and tan pieces just like in the version we got in 2001. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All

"Nmfrey23","2022-04-10T23:34:55.417Z","Pohatu, back again","<p>This is my favourite Toa set from 2008. What I like most about this set is how it sets itself apart from the other Toa sets even without an upside-down torso.This set&#39;s awesome weapons, three good functions and orange parts (almost never seen before 2008 in Bionicle)&nbsp;make it stand out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New parts: Blaster, helicopter blades, grey lower arm pieces, Matoran connector piece and mask are all new.</p>

<p>Colours: Orange!! Orange was used sporadically in sets throughout Bionicle as an accent colour. Pohatu Phantoka is one of few sets to feature orange as a primary colour. The Inika feet and the Piraka armour pieces are new in orange.</p>

<p>Weapons: I love this set&#39;s weapons. I have no clue if they&#39;re meant to be claws, drills, pickaxes or propellers. All make sense for a Toa of stone who took to the skies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Functions: This set has 3 functions. The first is a grey piece on Pohatu&#39;s back that allows for a Matoran to connect. The second is found within his weapons. They can open and close like claws, but they also feature cranks on the back that make the propeller blades spin rapidly. The last function is the blaster. It works well and can hold 4 shots (also compatible with 2006 ammo).</p>

<p>Uncommon parts: This set has a few parts that aren&#39;t new, but are still rare. The blue visor and the&nbsp;flattened eye piece are rare, and the torso piece used is only found in 1 other set.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t have true hands due to the nature of the weapons. This makes the set&#39;s arm movement pretty clunky.</p>

<p>Some may not enjoy the mask covering only half of the face or the fact that it looks different from the 2001 version.</p>

<p>Neck is slightly wobbly.</p>

<p>The set uses a lot of grey as a secondary colour. Some may not like this.</p>

<p>The propeller parts are made of a softer plastic and can fray around the edges if spun a lot.</p>

<p>Brittle Joints (applies to all 08&#39;-10&#39; sets).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set was fun both during and after building. If you liked the original Toa Mata or Nuva versions of Pohatu, this change in colour and design might be a little jarring, but his new features ensure that he is still the unique one of the bunch, just like he was back in 2001.</p>

<p>4/5</p>
