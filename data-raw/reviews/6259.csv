"Nate_Wan","2007-12-22T14:20:05.093Z","Well this set......",".... is very intresting. On the upside there are alot of new parts including awsome wing parts and shadow leech container. The Only thing I dont like is the weapons he carries which seem out of place so...
Pros:
Awsome New Mask
Shadow Leech sphere bomber works well
Wings are nice and look like thoose are his main weapon
New joints hold well and look good
Most pieces of the Phantoka Makuta

Cons:
Carried weapons seem added on
Piraka legs, feet and armor
No armor under the shadow leech holder

In all this is a good set and the Phantoka were desighned well so
9.2/10

"Gus_263","2008-04-05T12:43:28.293Z","Makuta of Karda Nui","Antroz is one of the Makuta Phantoka. Like Chirox, Icarax, Vamprah and Mutran, Antroz includes a weapon on the body, the Tridax Pod. The tridax pod is orange and includes inside four shadow leeches with different color schemes. The Tridax don't shoots in a great distance, but works very well, only pressing the back of the weapon. This set have a nice design, color scheme (black and red), also a simple but in good style building (have few innovations, like the tridax, but still cool). The Antroz's feet are piraka claws, the same of hakkan, and his legs are in a piraka style, but black and with red armors. The body have a hole on it, because the Tridax pod must stay on it. The arms are no new and are like the legs, his blades are awesome and encurved, but no much like the Chirox's hooks. The head of Antroz is the same of the other Makuta Phantoka and his mask is so cool, good designed and with nice colors. Like the other Phantoka, Antroz can &quot;team up&quot; with a matoran of 2008. The best to &quot;team up&quot; with Antroz is Radiak, that looks like himself in minor form, also cool. Antroz too have wings, these are long, in a good size and it have a good position, near to the arms and still playable. The playability is like the same of other bionicle sets released in this year, is simple and good, with some features like the capacity to &quot;team up&quot; and to launch some things, like the shadow leeches. Overall, Antroz is an awesome bionicle new set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-09-10T14:24:16.653Z","Antroz, leader of the Karda Nui Makuta team","This is Antroz. He has 42 Kraata powers and a mask of Corruption. He was chosen to be the leader of the Karda Nui Makuta. 
When Karda Nui was discovered by Vamprah, the Brotherhood of Makuta chose the best of Makuta warriors to invade.
They sent 7 Makuta (Antroz, Chirox, Krika, Mutran, Vamprah, Gorast and Bitil) to Karda Nui. When Matoro used the Ignika, Antroz, Vamprah and Chirox got blinded. Antroz chose Radiak to act as his eyes.(Antroz summoned Icarax later.)
 Anyway, Pros and Cons:

Pros:
Kanohi Jutlin, Mask of Corruption
New pieces (Wings, body, claws)
Claw Blades
Stands up well
Good colour scheme
Tridax Pod

Cons:
Head wobbles about

Overall, a brilliant Makuta, 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

lots of new pieces
cool mask
cool blades

"Carl","2009-10-30T19:39:25.89Z","Well...","O.K. So the mask is good. The feet are good even though they are stolen from Hakann. But his true nature is masked by a shroud of CGI awesomeness on the canister. Pros and Cons:

Pros:
Cool mask
Cool feet
Nice build like all Phantoka Makuta
Shadow leech sac

Cons:
Wings are dumb and short compared to Vamprah's and Chirox's
Blades look just plain weird
Old armour plates
Limbs are stolen from the Piraka

Overall Antroz is a Bionicle that you should get but not one that you should expect to completely wow you.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Tri_pod_king","2008-12-22T13:25:05.763Z","Bombs away!","My friend got me this set as a Christmas present last year and I've enjoyed it ever since. When I saw Mistika Toa Nuva Tahu for the first time, I thought in a fight against Antroz, he would win. Now, I think Antroz would win. I'm not going to criticize about Tahu in this review,(I already did that in Tahu's review!) but I will talk about the good things about Antroz.
                     Antroz is solidly built and is very sturdy. His 'Tridax pod and Shadow Leeches' mechanism works well, and to top it off, he looks AWESOME. The only down side is that his head jiggles around a lot and it's incredibly annoying. Other than that, this is a great figure. They did a good job on making his mask look like the new face of evil. Oh, one more down side is that the wings are really cool and are a nice touch, but when playing with Antroz or setting him up in a pose, the wings can get in the way and can be very awkward and irritating. Other than those two cons, this figure is a must have.

"Derek2441","2008-11-14T18:34:45.123Z","I don't know...","This set is good, but there is a number of flaws. For a simple review, i will put it this way:

PROS
Cool mask
Wings
Neat weapons
Tridax pod works good

Cons
Wobly head(annoying!)
Incredibly thin
Identicle arms and legs
Wings are attached to arms, making it hard to pose
Matoran attaching thing ruins his look
Not much new pieces
Not very fun without Radiak
Not smart to buy Radiak because he is expensive.

"james3426","2009-10-26T18:41:26.093Z","""You play with pebbles, Toa, while your universe falls.""","Antroz is my favorite Makuta member that I have. (I also have Krika and Vamprah.) He has many cool pieces that include: Wings, claws, Kanohi Jutlin, and the tridax pod halves. He is fun to pose and make him look like he's flying. These claws are rare and cool. The base of them vaguely resemble Thok's ice gun. The wings can be used as arm blades in an MOC. I added a Piraka eye stalk because, I heard that he has the powers of heat vision and laser vision. The mask, like Vamprah's looks like a vampire.

pros:
Kanohi Jutlin.
Claws.
Wings.
pose-able wings.

cons:
Tridax pod doesn't always break open.

In all, a cool Makuta. Get him as your third Makuta if you already have Icarax and Mutran.( I wish I had Mutran.)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
