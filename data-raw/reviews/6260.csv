"Gus_263","2008-04-11T18:03:52.28Z","Makuta of Karda Nui, Vamprah","This is one of the main sets released in the begin of 2008, of the subtheme Phantoka, that consists in three Toa Nuva and three Makuta, in the storyline are in Karda Nui, a location in the bionicle story. This like the other makuta of the phantoka subtheme launchs a tridax pod, that have inside shadow leeches, and also looks like with bats and vampires. This is the blue set, have a different designed mask, with the principal color and silver. The tridax can carry some shadow leeches and works very well when launched. To launch is easy, pushing a part of a piece that looks like be two claws in the center of the body. The arms were used previously on sets, making that be useful too. The weapons are the hooks, additions for the wings located under the hand piece and in a part of the arm. The leg is small, but makes the set looks like more with a bat and the blue parts can be used as blades too, another useful pieces. For technic have too useful pieces, like the common that keeps the eyes of the set in the head and many others. The playability is great because the set is an action figure and in the same time a building toy with lego quality. With a matoran of karda nui set, the playability can be greater(is well if with gavla, because she have the same color scheme).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

pros:
wings
lots of new pieces
cool mask
cool blades

cons:
none

I think this set is really cool 5/5

you can combine it with Vamprah and Toa Ignika to make a Niazesk. If you want to get a Niazesk I'll just do a tiny review of him:

Niazesk are good combos.

Pros:
cool jaws
cool wings
cool blades

Cons:
Bad colour scheme
leg armour flips down
tail doesn't move

quite a good combo 4/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-21T20:57:45.34Z","He Drives Me Batty (and that's a good thing)!!","He was the first set i got for 2008, and was one of my favorites immediately.  In fact, I think he IS my favorite Bionicle of 2008.  I love his batty look; it's really neat.  I mean, even his mask has a bat aspect to it.  The wings are so neat; they are almost too bat-like.  I also like the way he joins up with Gavla.  They look really neat together.  I'm almost sad he died.  :(  Anyway, on to the Pros and Cons.

Pros:

Batty look

Batty wings

Batty Mask of Hunger

Tridax Pod

Overall batty look

Cons:

Claws fall out (you can solve this by switching the hands out)

Please pay no heed to the Cons.  It's just there to be honest.  Go get Vamprah before he goes in the next month!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Carl","2009-10-30T19:32:16.093Z","Big Bad Blue Bat Battles Brave But Bothersome Bigwigs (Toa) ","WOW! Vamprah is awesome!

The new Phantoka Bionicles had been long awaited by me and my brother after seeing pictures of them on Brickshelf. And then they finally arrived in the local Toyworld shop, and we simply had to get them. So I got Lewa, Pohatu and Chirox, because those are my Bionicle colours, and my brother got Vampprah and Antroz. He still hasn't bought Kopaka, now that I think of it. Now onto the review.

Pros:
Bat-like appearance is great
Shadow leech sac is cool
Good build - nice to see something new
Original old Gali hooks look awesome in silver
New wings are extremely cool
Mahri Matoran blades used as back legs
Really good posability
Mask/face is one of the best

Cons:
NONE!

Everybody should make Vamprah one of the first Phantoka they get because he is awesome!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-29T15:35:12.67Z","Silent Hunter","          Vamprah is a pretty cool Makuta, but like Krika, I do not like the way he is quadruped. The Kanohi Avsa, mask of hunger, looks like some cross between a horse and what he resembles, a vampire bat. (Ever notice how every Makuta resembles an animal?) I recently got his claws back from a friend who borrowed them, so I decided to review him. His ""arms"" are actually wings, just like a bat's arms are in fact, wings. The tridax pod does not break open easily over carpet, so try it on bare floor. The feet are Mahri Nui Matoran Electro-blades in BLUE! These never came in blue before!

          Speaking of recolored pieces, he also has a Takadox armor plate in silver rather than translucent blue! The wings are also in different colors: back wings have blended silver and blue, and the front wings are in light gray blended with silver. (Don't believe me because, of that picture? Look on the parts list.) 

pros:
Many cool pieces recolored.
Most bat-like Makuta. (In my opinion)
Blended blue and silver Kanohi Avsa.
Tridax Pod halves are awesome!
Fun to pose.

cons:
Quadruped.

This is a great source for many cool pieces in different colors. He is okay, but I like Antroz more. (I Only rated this five because of the colors.)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
