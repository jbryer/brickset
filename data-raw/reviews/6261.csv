I look forward to getting the other sets in this sub-theme.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-13T15:14:18.89Z","Phantoka Chirox","Chirox is the black Phantoka of the 2008 winter in the bioncle series, and is a makuta. Like the other Phantoka Makuta, this set have a design made to it looks like a bat, and the design is very good. The color is also, a black with some silver details. Chirox feet are like piraka claws, but are unic pieces with two &quot;fingers&quot; (they are not playable, being not exactly fingers), and his legs are black hordika, with two silver simple armors. This set is so simple, but the playability is great. The body have a weapon called tridax pod, that includes four shadow leeches inside, and if you press the piece on the back, the tridax pod falls and the leeches jump from it. Due to this system, the body is limited to more armors. His arms are also simple, but extended to the wings be fixed well, but this extension to the wings don't have armors, and again, Chirox looks like simple. The weapons, called hook blades, on each arm, are in a great size, and also awesome designed, but encurved. The head is like the toa head,but with the orange eyes, and the mask is very cool, and sometimes looks like a bat. Another feature of Chirox is the capacity to &quot;team up&quot; with the shadow matoran Kirop, but in the makuta, the piece that do them team up is bad positioned, but the set still good. Overall, Chirox is a cool and playable set, but with few armors, that makes he looks like simple. Due to the other features and functions, this set is a good option to bionicle fans buy. I rate Chirox 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Carl","2009-10-14T03:44:17.89Z","Watch the skies, Matoran of Karda Nui! Chirox is coming!","WOW! I never thought that so much freakish awesomeness could be achieved in a Bionicle. Chirox is by far the best Makuta so far. His wings and mask make him look like a really freaky bat and they got the colours absolutely right. Cool feet and weapons too. This guy is one of the most posable Bionicles in the history of Lego., and you can create really cool stalking poses and scenes using this guy. The leech sac* is really cool too but it doesn't always break open on impact with the ground. Apart from that, Chirox is a definite must have for all Bionicle lovers.

"greshmalum","2009-02-08T12:54:01.233Z","Chirox","Chirox specializes in making rahi, all of which were made by the Makuta at sometime or another. He is the best of all the Maluta, (other than Maluta inhabited Maxilos) in my opinion. He has the Great Mask of Silence which enables him to temperarily take away the ability to hear and/or speak. His HUGE shoulders are one of my favorite parts. 
Pros-
Character
Phantoka
Shoulders
Mask abilities
Cons-
Head teeters tiny fraction of an inche to the side

"james3426","2009-10-31T22:33:17.263Z","Scientist Makuta","This is my first review of one of my brother's sets. He is batlike, but not as much as Vamprah. The hook blades are very cool tools/weapons that look very lethal with their jagged edges. In this picture, it looks like the Kanohi Shelek, mask of silence is taller, when actually, it goes far back, but not even close to Krika-like. The wing-like arms I prefer to keep unfolded so I can pose him in many different ways. I like the idea of using Piraka arms to let them fold up. The tridax pod is okay as I said in the other Makuta reviews, but same problem of not always opening. i have also noticed now that the shadow leeches are easy to lose, since my brother dropped the pod once and one leech he could not find. The only other problem I see is those bright, screaming red axles that connect the upper leg armor to the leg. They stick out like crazy! I would replace them with black ones.

pros:
Hook blades.
clawed feet.
Kanohi Shelek.
Wings.
Loooong arms.

cons:
Screaming red axles STICK OUT.
Tridax pod does not always open.

The cons are not very big, so I still recommend him to any Bionicle fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Nmfrey23","2022-07-03T17:27:07.193Z","The REAL Makuta scientist","<p>&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure if this is personal bias, but I adore the 2008 villain sets from Bionicle. Each of them are ghastly and scary looking, and yet they are all vastly different. Chirox fits these criteria perfectly. This set stands tall and is reminiscent of a skeleton, while also packing a completely unique hidden feature in its arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New parts: Clawed feet, ribcage, torso, mask, wings, hooked blades, Tridax Pod and rubber leeches are all new parts for 2008. There are also a few old parts in new colours, like Nuparu Mahri armour in silver.</p>

<p>Overall look: This set is arguably the creepiest of the three Phantoka Makuta. Chirox is ghoulish and looks very threatening when his arms are folded up. Additionally, the silver pieces in this set work with Chirox&#39;s primary colours (black and silver) whereas the silver parts in the other Phantoka Makuta sets don&#39;t work as well with (Antroz is red and Vamprah is blue).</p>

<p>Functions: This set has 3 functions. The first is a connector block located by the hip piece. This allows for an Av Matoran&nbsp;to attach to Chirox. The second function is the ribcage.&nbsp;Since the plastic that the ribcage is made of is malleable, it&nbsp;can be pushed in to release the Tridax Pod. Ideally, the pod will explode in a shower of the rubber leeches if dropped from high enough. The final &quot;function&quot; is found within the set&#39;s arms. Chirox has a hidden joint in both arms. The set&#39;s box art shows them folded up, but they are freakishly long when extended. Chirox (swords included) likely has the longest arm span of any Bionicle set.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>While the set&#39;s arms do have four joints, the arms aren&#39;t great when it comes to movement. When extended, the arms might be too heavy to stay up. When folded, the elbow joints and the shoulder joint are never fully functioning. Additionally, this set doesn&#39;t have true hands, and uses Toa Hordika head blocks instead, limiting wrist movement.</p>

<p>Chirox is a pretty spindly set. While the thin limbs compliment the skeletal look, this certainly won&#39;t be a look that pleases everyone, since the set&#39;s limbs are either lightly armoured or unarmored.</p>

<p>Wobbly neck (applies to all 08&#39; Makuta except Gorast and Bitil).</p>

<p>Brittle Joints (applies to all 08&#39;-10&#39; sets).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Chirox certainly isn&#39;t a perfect, it&nbsp;still remains a standout set from 2008. It&#39;s creepy, cool looking, and brings a lot of new parts and features to the table. Definitely a solid choice for old and new fans alike. 4/5</p>
