Minifig:
The new Ha-Ya-To minifig is great and his armor looks like he's ready for a long survival trek

Model:
The nice red color is appealing yet is still abit basic. The best part is that you fet to actually build the feet! His main gun is kinda bland though it works for this model.

Mini-Robot:
This robot is very baisic but offers tons of playibility and is a nice addition. As a gun it looks really good but has a hard time staying on also the River Dragon looks odd with its right arm mising.
All in all it is a great set so

"CyandraZ","2008-05-04T16:48:23.763Z","The best small Exo-force mech ever!","2008 brings the Exo-Force series to an end, and thankfully makes up for the mostly lackluster 2007 kits with an amazing lineup. Sinister multilegged robot mechs, fierce human  mechs, the single best robot flying vehicle, and an awesome new gimmick make the final exo-force year a great one.

River Dragon puts Hayato out in front as one of the three different human pilots in the main lineup. This is unusual, as Ryo has usually been the third main pilot (along with Takeshi and Hikaru), but I think it’s cool that TLC is switching things around. His uniform, like all the human uniforms this year, is a combination of the simple 2006 designs, the shiny armored 2007 designs, and a bit of a camouflage pattern. This is pretty cool as well – but I’m not surprised, as the exo-force minifig torsos have always been great.

River Dragon is a small mech, yet it still is fairly decent in size and bulk, with legs that combine the 2007 design with brick built feet, and angled arms with huge shoulders. The weapons are limited but cool: a nice laser pistol, two small laser cannons on the cockpit, and a laser cannon connected to the transforming mini robot. The canopy is a lot bigger in the River Dragon than in previous exo-force small mechs, which makes it seem more armored and powerful. Other details include two small turbines attached to the shoulders, and an antenna and satellite dish. All in all River Dragon is a very sleek and impressive design, and unlike previous small mechs like Uplink and Cyclone Defender, is more of a miniature version of the large mechs than a small support vehicle.

The transforming mini robot on River Dragon is simple and a bit less impressive than the ones on Chameleon Hunter and Assault Tiger, and also doesn’t stay on the best. More disappointing is that when you take it off, the right arm of River Dragon looks incomplete – making me wish there was another weapon the mini robot attached to, instead of it being the right arm’s weapon.

Piecewise, River Dragon is decent, but not nearly as good a parts pack as other 2008 exo-force kits. A few rare red slopes, the white turbines, and a bunch of the bionicle/system hybrid joints are the highlights of the set, but there is nothing really that special. However, the piece selection is still good, and compliments the wonderful model very nicely.

Overall, River Dragon is a step up from all previous Exo-force small mechs. The design is powerful looking, considering its size, and has a lot of cool details and a great color scheme. If you are into Exo-Force, this kit should be a must have for you. 5/5

"Shadow_Crawler","2008-05-20T21:20:04.5Z","Cool Dragon!","Box &amp; Instructions = 5/5

The box is excellent, featuring the RD in action with a river as background. Surprisingly, there are 2 instructions in this set, although this is a small set.

Building = 4/5

The building is cool enough, MANY NEW PARTS. But it's pretty confusing when building the right weapon (the mini-bot) first, you build the mini-bot, then you must turn it to form the weapon. It's pretty confusing because the instruction's picture was pretty hard to understand. There are also (I hate this part) STICKERS! Although, there are only 7 stickers, I still hate them.

Playability = 5/5

This set is excellent in playability, but it doesn't have any can-be-shot weapons (like Sky Guardian's ion launcher or Blazing Falcon's missile). It does have a lot of articulation points, and it look fierce with red color.

Overall = 5/5

Pros:
Fierce red color
Many new parts
Transforminf mini-bot

Cons:
STICKERS!
Confusing when building the mini-bot

"Gus_263","2008-03-11T15:00:49.717Z","River dragon","This set is an little exo force of 2008. The set like some little of 2007 but still cool. The color is nice and the Hayato's minifigure is also included. The weapons are few and small. The playability of the machine is basically the same of the 2007 small exo force. The pieces are useful to make robots, and with the red and white colors. The &quot;mini robot&quot;, also included, can shift in a weapon, but is no much playable. The left hand is good but it was used so much in exoforce sets yesteryear. The weapon is great builted but really no playable like others. This set also includes mini proppelers  on each side of the robot, that makes an cool feature for the design. Unfortunately, the mini robot do not gives space to another weapon, like a blade, and the set don't have much playability and innovations, but it still nice. I rate the River Dragon 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Lint","2008-07-17T13:02:34.373Z","My first and last exoforce","Pros
*Decent number and assortment of lego pieces. Some a pretty cool
*Love the fist and short gun

Cons
*HaYaTo's hair piece doesn't really stay on too well
*The cockpit doesn't stick that well to the main frame in play. Especially when you open and close the hatch.
*The long gun thing design is kinda flimsy and uninspired. Would have liked another fist instead.
*Limited poseability. While there is articulation, it isn't brilliant.
*HaYaTo doesn't get his own weapon (unless he cannibalises the mecha's gun)

I guess you really have to be an exoforce fan to appreciate this one. Theres a lot of pieces you get in this kit that you wont find in other themed kits. Thats about all the good I can say about it.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Obi_Wan9994","2008-08-03T12:32:25.873Z","I never thought I'd actually say this, but Exo-Force is COOL!","I took second place in a Lego contest, and this was my prize. I thought, oh well, at least I got something. So I built it thinking it would sit around with no use, and boy was I wrong.
