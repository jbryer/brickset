Never has a set this small been so action packed, and come with so many features. It's really a treat to have, and a great way to start a year. The set features one minifigure, a silver robot, which I am glad to see lego hasn't changed the design of, as well as a mini robot, essentially four spider legs and a disembodied human skull. Nice. The mech itself is pretty cool with orange and black parts which are nice and similar to last year's claw crusher. All in all, I am left both shocked and awed by the simplicity and complexity of this funny little set, which interestingly enough features 2 INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS. I am left highly recommending this set. Well worth your money. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"justrock","2007-12-30T17:42:57.763Z","Cool and Creepy","This set is a quick build, but the end result is pretty neat. It seems so simple, but at the same time I would've never thought of it. Lego really did a lot with a few bricks for this one. However, it was weird to see two instruction booklets in the box. Really, they couldn't put it all into one? Anyways. The Halloween orange and black colors add to the menacing feel, though a little more firepower would be welcomed. The rear escape pod is a nice touch. Would like the front skull-robot thing to not come off so easy, but other than that the set seems fairly strudy.
Would like to see a slightly bigger version, though. Not to say that this one is small, it just feels smaller when next to another ExoForce mech. It is pretty cheap, so I might buy a second and combine them. Just a thought.

"CyandraZ","2008-05-08T16:11:50.013Z","Very unique.","In 2008, the third and final year of exo-force, the robot battle machines have taken an unusual route – abandoning conventional mechs for multilegged, melee attacking walkers. This interesting design route is one of the many things that has made Januarry 2008 the best exo-force lineup by far.

Arachnoid Stalkers has all the elements a classic spider mech – a lot of legs, a spider like construction, and features like eyes and fangs. However, it also has several interesting features as well. The most notable of them is the robot cockpit – which also doubles as a detachable scout flyer. The cockpit by itself looks slightly strange, but the nearness of the feature makes up for the slightly odd design.

The mini robot is really quite strange – a trans-green orb with 4 small robot arms. It looks fine when on the Arachnoid Stalkers, but when it’s detached it really looks quite odd – how is it supposed to move around anyway? Does it jet around, or does it hop on the ground?

The most interesting thing about the 2008 robot mechs is that they seem to be designed for attacking straight on instead of shooting weapons from a distance. The Arachnoid Stalker is lightly armed with two cannons on the front legs, as well as “eyes” that are probably small lasers. However, it looks like the Aracnoid Stalker's main way of attacking is to leap onto opposing mechs and shred them with its fangs and leg-mounted chainsaws. This certainly is a unique way of designing mechs, and I really like the variety.

Piecewise, Arachnoid Stalker is quite nice. Several orange tiles, orange Viking horns, black fins, and a couple rare trans-green elements make this a great parts pack for 8 dollars. For the third year in a row, the robots have no new figures at all – which is disappointing. I would have loved to see the Arachnoid Stalker piloted by an orange tinted Devastator instead of just a plain silver Devastator, but alas – no such luck.

Arachnoid Stalker is quite a cool little mech. It may be unusual, but it has some very novel ideas incorporate into it, and a lot of great parts. Besides the boring figure and strange mini-robot, Battle arachnoid is very well designed. f you are an exo-force fan or a MOC’er, you should pick this up. 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Captain","2008-09-26T19:16:20.81Z","A cool set, with a few pleasant surprises.","First off, this set looks nice. Very spider-like, and pretty sweet with all the fangs and such. My favorite part of this set is probably the fact that it comes with 2 skulls, which have the classic skull print. Now, if you remember, for several years following the underwater alpha-team series, all lego made was the retarded looking evil skulls. You know, with the evil eyes and the twisted grin. For some reason, they used these even on normal skeletons (like in the 2nd aqua-raiders theme). It really annoyed me, because the classic skulls looked so much better. Now, I'm happy because it looks like they're making them again. Anyway...

This set comes with a wealth of parts that are quite useful for building your own stuff. A few examples include a round 2x2 brick and two 2x2 domes, in trans-neon green. Also, lots of little fang pieces in orange, and a chainsaw body and 2 chainsaw blades.

So, buy it. It's awesome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-10-12T14:43:50.92Z","Smaller than you think...","When I first saw this, I thought ""That's big..."", but when I got it, it was A LOT smaller! First of all, a biology lesson to LEGO: Arachnids have EIGHT(8) legs, not six! This set has a mini-robot that can detach. However, when you insert it up front, it just doesn't look right! The cockpit can detach to make a small flying escape-vehicle. It has guns and saws up front, and spikes on all legs. Onto the pros and cons:

Pros -
Mini-robot
Devastator robot
Spikes
Saws
Escape-vehicle

Cons -
Smaller than it looks
Mini-robot up front spoils the look
Six legs: Arachnids have eight!

Overall, a ver good set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
