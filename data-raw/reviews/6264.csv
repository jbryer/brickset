"shima55","2007-12-04T22:40:15.653Z","A good, solid mecha for the EXO-FORCE team","EXO-FORCE mecha often have nice designs, but they are not very sturdy. The new Deep Jungle sets seem to solve that problem, and still keep the nice look.

Pros:
Takeshi Minifigure with new clothes
Yellow color, a first for a mech in this price range
New saw piece
Well armoured
Spy Drone
Broad, paw-like feet
Extremely sturdy
Seat for pilot
Chain saws for figures
Maroon Robot arms
Good poseability

Cons:
Back is unarmoured
Large stick piece on the back of the Spy Drone is cumbersome
Stickers
Antennae could fall off easy

Overall, it is a great start for EXO-FORCE 2008, with a solid construction, and the new mini-robot addition.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"j45per","2007-12-20T12:14:14.717Z","good set ","unlike most of the other 2008 mecs this one has a fully surrounded cotpit and is built better also but there are some bad points

problems

hand withe the mini robot looks odd

body is dwarfed by the legs (the legs stil look good)

good points 

buzz saw looks amazing

also a mini robot 

it is a must have set and good to combine with

"TinyHippo","2008-02-07T06:27:31.153Z","Awesome Set","The Assault Tiger is a great new set for 2008. The cockpit is a sit down one, which makes it feel like more of a vehicle. The weapons are good, the drone is fun and the spare parts are useful. It only missed out on a 5 due to the disappointing dependence on stickers. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"reidak49","2008-02-03T14:42:02.53Z","wow","this is cool the cockpit is disned different then previous battle machines and the shoulder pads look cool the legs are wel armored and that buzz saw is a must but a con is the enntena falls off to easily and the gun could be bigger but thats not a problem",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smjo26","2008-02-06T13:43:47.187Z","My Favorite!","This is my favorite Deep Jungle set! I love how it's built! The fully surrounded cockpit is nice and very air tight. Here is the pros and cons

Pros:
- The Legs (I don't know why I just love how they look!)
- Feet (they are so cool!) they are kind of paw like (thats what makes it so cool)
- Mini-Robot 
- Massive Saw 
- Missile
- Armor

Cons:
-The mini-robot gets in the way when you play with it attached

This is the Best of the deep Jungle. Its a Great display/play set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sith_assassin","2008-01-22T12:55:17.84Z","A Must Have Set","this set is amazing. as you can see from my collection i am more of a star wars person. this weekend i was in chicago for a hockey tourament and after one of the games i went to the mall. at the mall there was a lego store and i found this beauty.

the mini robot is cool but not mini compared to the figure. the robots arms are very poseable but not the legs. the pole sticking out off his is one of the minor flaws.

the assult tiger is great the buzz saw is big, cool, and it spins very well the gin on the other side is cool and big. the legs and feet are very poseable. the feet do look like tiger feet. the shoulders are one of the problems, the dont pose well. the cockpit is cool but the sides and the back are open but can be fixed with a few bricks. the stickers are cool but i wish they were printed. the tiger is very very sturdy compared to the stelth hunter.

Overall get it. with just a few ajustments the set is perfect. i look forward to getting the chameleon hunter and maybe not a star wars set. this could be my converionl.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-06-22T13:41:18.123Z","HUGE Legs","This set is good, let's see...
Box = 5/5
Nice box with the plastic thing (like in Mutran) and a good CGI.

Building = 4/5
Building this set is fun, but not challenging because it was only weapons, legs, and torso. The connection between legs and torso is very weak.

Playability = 5/5
Nice set to play with, the buzzsaw is nice, and the mini-robot is good too.

Overall = 4/5
Pros:
Huge legs
Nice buzzsaw
Good cockpit style
I like the chest armor

Cons:
Stickers
Weak connection between legs and torso

"MrHeadache","2008-02-23T14:34:41.873Z","My favourite Exo-Force set","I really love this set! I can see nothing wrong with it! It has an awesome cockpit and the mini-robot is really cool. Also it is incredibly sturdy for an Exo-Force set. Overall a great set, I would recommend it to anyone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-04-12T23:53:10.14Z","So Bright!  Yellow, Yellow, Everywhere.","This is an interesting vehicle.  I REALLY like the nice big feet. and legs.  It really gives the robot a good platform for standing.  The gun on the left arm is a good looking gun, and has a hand to boot.  The saw is okay.  It is not my favorite part since it does not swivel to change directions.  It would be better if it could twist.  It is nice to see a fully-enclosed cockpit.  So many of these EF robots do not protect their pilot much, but not this one!

I am not really a fan of these mini-robots.  They are usually just thrown on somewhere on the robot, and this one is no different.  The Assault Tiger looks much better with the mini not attached. I do however like this mini.  It looks menacing with the two saws, and nice shoulder armor.

Overall this is a well designed robot and can be posed a lot of different ways and still be very stable.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Inferno_Ratchet","2008-05-01T19:20:17.827Z","Mech of a kind(with a saw)","This is my first exo-force mech... Right on to pros and cons then...

pros:
cool saw
cool mini-bot
amoured legs(bolky)

cons:
skiny arms
gun part keeps falling off
mini-bot on arm makes arm movment difficult

Over all a good set.

"legomarsfan","2009-03-07T15:28:58.107Z","My second exo-force set","Yeah its my second so on to the review.The mech is awseome,looks tough and has  nice details on the stickers like all exo force sets.Another antenna or 2 one small with a dish the same as the marsmission mobile minning unit one.The big legs are so nice as for the buzzsaw there are no words to describe its awsemnoes.Minifigs takeshi and a minibot with a long rod on the back which i really dont like but its easy replaceble.So thats about it for my opinion get this set if your a fan of exo-force or you like mechs,robots,state of the art battles and ... Buzzsaws:) ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2009-11-20T04:37:46.297Z","Great mech!","The Tiger Assualt is a wonderful mech. It includes a blade and a nice little mini robot. The legs and the feet are awsome. You also get another exo-code which can be used for the LEGO Exo-Force website. The transparent-orange top always popps of when you want to open it and want to sit in Takeshi who has a double sided head. Takeshi's hair piece is rubbery. The instruction has no mistake and I didn't have any missing parts. It's an awsome model. I higly can recommend you to get this set.<br><br><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8113-1.jpg[/img]</span><span></span><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Positive:</span><br><br><ul><li>Blade</li></ul><ul><li>Color</li></ul><ul><li>Attractive box</li></ul><ul><li>Design of the feet and legs</li></ul><ul><li>Laser gun</li></ul><ul><li>Mini robot</li></ul><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Negative:</span><br><br><ul><li>Set comes with stickers</li></ul><ul><li>No controls in the cockpit (how is Takeshi able to control the mech?)</li></ul><br>All
