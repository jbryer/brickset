"Gus_263","2008-04-12T17:56:44.857Z","The Chameleon Hunter","This is one of the Exo force 2008 sets. In the last year of Exo force, the Hikaru's machine is the chameleon hunter. This set is playable, features a nice color scheme and also the building and useful pieces included. The legs are basic, with nice designed but too small feet under. Not supporting well, the feet and legs still very good due to the color scheme (some green scheme and black details), and too due to pieces increasing it, like armors for the machine. The body is small, the cockpit is much above in comparison with other Hikaru's Exo force machines, but the minifigure stay on it well. The machine don't features any head, is characteristic of the Exo force theme, but it looks like good, altough the body itself makes the set more small. The arms are simple also, thin, more than the machines of 2007, and with no new features. The green pieces increasing it on the shoulder makes it better, but also odd, because the arms are so much more upper than the cockpit. Altough this feature is not the best for build a  cool robot like machine, it is an innovation, and works well with a nice color. The weapon on the right &quot;hand&quot;, is a fire sword (the weapon of the first Toa Tahu, from the bionicle theme), that is good fixed with it, but is better with a bionicle set, this exo force machine don't moves well carrying it. There is also a mini sized robot, simple, altough good designed, but don't moves well, it unbuild when playing someteimes. The mini robot is a feature, but the best to make with it is use the pieces to increase the machine. On the left &quot;hand&quot;, there are three red blades, the same of the Bionicle Barraki set Mantax, well fixed but don't works well with the hand's movements. The machine is a good Exo force set, with some unnecessary  features, like the mini robot, the stickers, and also some bad positioned things, like the cockpit. The hikaru's minifigure is the same of his previous, but with some changes on details, to the forest (the 2008 Exo force storyline is on the forest). Overall, another Exo force set with some problems, but also nice features. This machine isn't the best to buy, but if you want to increase your Exo force collection with more fun, this is a good option.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-10-20T21:32:54.31Z","HUH?","This looks too jungle like to me even though this is supposed to be a Manga type of set. The arms are OK, but could have been better. There are too many green pieces and really doesn't fit with the other Exo Force sets. This isn't the best set out there for an Exo Force set. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Tri_pod_king","2008-11-27T13:02:35.263Z","Oh, come on, Lego!","You can do better than that! The Stealth Hunter was fantastic. The Sky Guardian was great. This was a sheer drop. Sure, you can throw in some cool pieces, but in the end, you're gonna' have to start putting some mind into it. The spinning claw? Oh yah, REAL original. I guess- oops, I accidently just sent my review from that point! Well, I'll send this one when I'm done-anyway I guess I can accept the claw, but the flimsy robot? The cheap plastic fins? NO CONTROLS!?! No, Lego, that won't do. And what's else, it has an open cockpit! GRRRRR. Could've easily been fixed. But the thing that bugged me the most was how awkward the legs were! The side fins kept getting in the way of each other. If you're a Hikaru fan, get this set. Otherwise, pass.

"gome4","2009-08-28T10:42:53.123Z","hi i dont know what to put here","most people would disagree with me, but i think this is Hikaru's best mech. 
my only issue is that it is all its weapons are close range, except the rockets. apparently, the cannon is in the middle of the claw though

pros
mini robot
flame sword
claw grips and spins
new pieces, rubber at tip
hikaru is not exposed, except for some small holes
blends in with the jungle

cons
it cant fly(apparently it can jump long distances)
antenna pops of easily
glass protection. if you move it to far up, it will come off(you need to loosen up the white and black bit holding it)

this set is like marmite. you either love it or hate it. me personally i love it

<h4>Pros</h4>
