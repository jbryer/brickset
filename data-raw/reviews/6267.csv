Assembling:
Easy. The manual is clearly and the construction consists only of columns and two house fronts.

Bright side of the moon:
+ Yellow tube (3 elements, moveable)
+ Helicopter
+ 2 road base plates
+ clever design of Window- and Door-elements (slips out of the mounting easily and therefore doesn't break)

Dark side of the moon:
- Clumsy construction

Additional stuff:
You better build this station upon basic plates or connect the road-parts with some flat bricks. Otherwise you will have to rebuild it more often, than my son pushes the dog through the tube :) The trailer made an awful squeeky noise out of the box. I fixed that with silicone spray. Ahhh... and we took away that evil siren. The WeoWeoWeoWeo-Noise made us nearly insane.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
