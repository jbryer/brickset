Just get 10 and you're good for a little squad of droids.  And, whgat is even better, is that the ship is really cool too and with tons of awesome peices.  This is a must have for any space fanatics.  The only problem is that the android has a helmet???/ why does a non living thihng need an airtank. overall it's a great set get it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-01-30T03:32:45.263Z","Space Scooter","Found this model in my collection yesterday, thought it was about time to rebuild it and review it. This model is the smallest of all the exploriens models and pretty basic to build. It has a similar shape to allot of the smaller models but is different in its own way. The model is a whole 23 pieces with 16 of those pieces in the ship.

The ship is white and black with neon blue lasers and a neon yellow booster. The ship also has boosters on either side that rotate 360 degrease, which is a nice way to change direction for such a small model. The vehicle is controlled by a control panel which is quiet different to most that I have. Both the control panel and front piece are painted on meaning another model with no stickers.

The mini-fig is an alien dressed in white pants and jacket, with silver and black on them. His helmet is a dark grey with a neon yellow visor. His face is black with circuits and a smile on it. The rest of his head is completely clear. He is also holding a black ray gun with a neon yellow bit at the end.

Overall this is another good model for the space range. It has good aesthetics but looks similar to allot of others. It playability is quite low but this is very common for a $3 model. I feel this model is a 5/10 or average as it isn't a bad model but has nothing ultra special about it. Still I would recommend this to any space fan or someone who is after small cheap models.
