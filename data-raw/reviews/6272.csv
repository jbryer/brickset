"Gus_263","2008-04-30T15:36:24.45Z","Roadster turbo","This tiny turbo was released in this year, with little innovations, like the glow in the dark pieces and the details(that are necessary). This have a building that looks like with many of the tiny turbos, due to the wheels and the pieces like ones with the flashlight details. Have too innovation in building, but don't in contents. 
 
These are more the roofless part, and two black pieces (used previously as small armors for the knights' kingdom action figures and exo-force battle machines) on this, to make this looks like with a roadster altough without any pilot. The ramp piece used as glass of the car is good made and with low height. The glow in the dark pieces(useful as flashlights or due to be used the same in all Tiny Turbos from this year) are placed under the front of the car. Can be putted pieces on the back of the car, altough don't have spoilers. Pieces like two red flashlights were putted on back, keeping a good design.

In playability this is great, also in the good contents, altough small and with the stickers (necessary to make details for tunned cars), and have no problem this be a tiny turbo without roof, because was the idea make a roadster. Like the other tiny turbos this deserves a 5/5 rate, in comparison with the size, number of pieces and price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rifraphy","2008-11-20T15:09:20.42Z","One of my favorites!","OK, first of all - this is not an ordinary TT. This is a spider, the first-ever TT cabrio! It's very flashy and the glow-in-the-dark pieces are a bit pointless (I've found they wear out after a few months, and kind of glow dully) but when built together on a piece with many studs, can glow quite nicely. It also has some very rare parts.

:: Very rare window piece
:: Flashy and shiny - and cute
:: Yellow/Black very nice color combination!
:: New design
:: Good parts pack
:: Nice stickers
:: Has he air of an unmistakeubly a very cool set ;)

;; A bit pricey.
;; Not many pieces, will do though.

Overall, 5 bricks! Very shiny and cute. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
