This car is beautiful. It is white, not gray as it looks in the pics. The stickers are metallic silver which make the car look gray/silver. There is a large Tiny Turbos sticker on the sticker sheet as well that is cool. The white mudguards are the first that I have come across im the sets that I own (although they come in the Bullet Run set). The car is similar to the yellow racer that comes in the Bridge Chase as well as the lime green Brickmaster exclusive set 7452. I don't know why the front 4 studs are showing. It makes the model look unfinished, like something is missing. I enjoy the color (you can only get excited about another red or black racer) and overall shape of the car. The stickers are a new color as well and look great even on the sticker sheet!

The glow in the dark headlights are cute little 1x1 cheese wedges but aren't that cool or necessary (who builds or plays in the dark?) I guess this is another ploy to grab the attention of kids.

In my opinion, if you only purchase 1 Tiny Turbos from the '08 lineup, this is the one to buy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Having said that, I do build them to check them out. The red one is cool, as the black with it is in a good proportion and it doesn't need the stickers.

This one however, cannot go sticker-less. Which is unfortunate for people like me, but for the kids it's aimed at, perfect for customisation.

It can take a crash or two.<br><br>The only thing keeping me from giving this a 5 are the stickers.  For a small set, there are 8 stickers.",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4
"Gus_263","2008-04-30T15:16:15.67Z","Racer of the midnight","This is one of the newest tiny turbos from 2008, altough with glow in the dark pieces, this don't have much innovations on pieces, and the review will like with my other reviews of tiny turbos. Comparing with the ideas of the set, reviewing the contents and the playability.

 This have the common pieces above the wheels, useful to tiny turbos or racers sets, but don't very for other themes(these pieces too are useful for city, but don't very because the city theme have more cars with minifigures, bigger than without them). The glow in the dark pieces are the same two of the other tiny turbos from 2008, but these are placed as flashlights. This don't have a ramp piece or any plate on the front of the &quot;glass&quot; piece, but it don't frustrates and keeps the design. A turbo, common in the subtheme, is included on back of the black &quot;glass&quot; piece, still good designed altough don't keeps the same height of the car. The plate as spoiler is on back and too is useful, once that many tiny turbos sets had and have this piece. The building of the sides of the set is basically the same of many vehicles of the subtheme, with plates on them, like in the set Rally rider(or rally runner). 

This set is playable and usable if in comparison with the idea of the set. This is tiny, but this being tiny don't means that this deserves a bad rate, so, like on my reveiews of tiny turbos, this deserves a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
