"thepeopleperson","2008-05-10T11:45:12.42Z","The Tiny Turbos Just Keep Getting Better!","I really just bought this set for the 8 black 1 x 1 slopes, the new 2 x 4 window slope, and, of course, the glow-in-the-dark lightsaber blades!  Here are pros and cons.

Pros:

Bigger than my other tiny turbos
Glow-in-the-dark lightsaber blades!
Lots of slopes
Shiny wheels
Stickers make the car look really nice (and if you want this set for parts, you don't get stuck with weird printed parts:-)

Cons: 

More expensive than the previous line of tiny turbos
The lightsabers get stuck in the holders on the side of the car. I replaced the holders with clips.

Overall this is a great set! It has lots of cool parts, and is definately worth the money!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"EXO_FORCE","2008-03-28T07:07:12.293Z","GREAT SET!!","First of all, i have to say that this is a very nice set!

1 Great number of parts [with this price!]
2 many black slope brick! [8 of 'em! nice for MOC]
3 A pair of GIDs[Glow in dark light saber] Nice for Star Wars Lover!
4 A Cool Stick Design
5 Tuner size car but it is a muscle!

And you can see, there is no reason that you don't buy it!
This is the best ever Tiny Turbo set made by LEGO!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguysw","2008-06-07T05:11:52.467Z","You call them glow sticks, i call them light up lightsabers!","Lets do a (detailed!) pros and cons for this one,
PROS:
1.LIGHT UP LIGHTSABERS!
2.Nice piece assortment (the reason I buy tiny turbos)
3.Lets say theres a 50% off all lego over &#163;30 at TRU. You want the 50% off, but you've only bough &#163;28 of lego. Buy a tiny turbo and pay &#163;15 for the lot!
4.The car looks very sleek!
CONS
1. DSS! DREADED STICKER SHEET! Atleast they are put to good use here, and if you want the pieces for other things, you have the choice of no detail, whereas you don't with prints.
2.The lightsabers (as i now call them!) can get in the way of the wheels, and its not very easy to move them.
OVERALL A 4!

"Gus_263","2008-05-01T14:22:50.047Z","Tiny turbo, ZX turbo","One of the most new tiny turbos, this, named ZX turbo, like the others, deserves a good rate if in comparison with the objectives of the set. Don't have minifigure, but wins playability due to the size, like to make tricks or races with more of the Tiny Turbos collection, and the pieces are useful, due to the shapes and sometimes to the colors, altough this have stickers, these are necessary to make more details for tunned cars. Being a tiny turbo with common things in comparison with the subtheme, my review to ZX turbo will like my other reviews to the vehicles from the subtheme.

Firstly, the common things are in this set, like the detailed (detailed in the shape, no with stickers) pieces on the front to looks like with flashlights, and too the wheels, from many of the sets, very used for cars that looks like with this. Also a black piece as glass for the car is included, keeping the design. Too a spoiler on back keep the design and the color scheme. This consists basically in black and red, and too details like the silver parts of the wheels and the stickers(with few differences, but these don't frustrates). As a feature from 2008, the glow in the dark pieces are included, don't the same of the others that are ramp pieces, but the glow in the dark pieces in the set are like the lightsaber pieces, that makes these be useful too for star wars. The building is solid, don't have plates on the side and have a good height. 

Overall: If you are searching for a little car for racers(don't city because the city's car needs a minifigure as a pilot) that have useful contents(to make creations too), is playable and have a solid buiding (if you don't like the building, is easy make another with these contents), searchs for that or any tiny turbo. This, like in my reviews for tiny turbos, deserves a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"bogdanst","2009-12-02T13:31:51.263Z","Great car","Ok, lots of ppl before me mentioned how cool these cars are. But, this car unlike the others has one big perk for those that do not just want a model of a race car, but want an addition to the town collection.

This car can easily be transformed into a car that can fit a minifig, just remove the central part, and on the plate add doors, steering wheel and windshield and you get on even cooler car for your LEGO streets.

And, on the other hand, this is the only set (from those that glow in the dark) where you can use its fluorescent part as a lightsaber blade, which are too cool.

The car itself is very elegant, and rolls smoothly, which made this model a ""must-buy"" for me, even if I do not collect tiny turbo model cars.
