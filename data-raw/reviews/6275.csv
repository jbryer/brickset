"Gus_263","2008-05-01T14:49:18.013Z","One of the 08' Tiny Turbo ","From the subtheme of tiny turbos, this set have common things in comparison with others from this subtheme. Like the contents, but a difference is the building. The playability too, is basically make this run and make races with this and more vehicles or too make tricks (is easy due to the size). Another common thing is the feature of the glow in the dark pieces, available on the 2008 sets. All the contents are useful and is easy make another types of building, make combinations or upgrade the car. 

The common contents are too the parts above the wheels, like one type of piece with details of flashlights, to the car. And the wheels too were used, but don't very on cars like this, due to be well placed, this isn't a con. And too the building with bricks with plates under and in the side keeps a good design and don't frustrates the playability. A common thing (that is really the same thing) is the spoiler on the vehicle's back, placed above, was used previously in other set, named &quot;TunerX&quot;, the spoiler consists in a piece originally used in the subtheme by the set named &quot;Street Maniac&quot; and a common plate. Have too a ramp piece on the front and one bigger as the glass of the car(this is black, like in the other sets of the subtheme). And too a turbo is included, could be placed better, but still cool and like with the design. Another cool things are the glow in the dark pieces, features from 2008. Like some tiny turbos(except ZX turbo), these are ramp pieces.

Overall: if you searchs for a small car for complete your collection for racers don't losting playability, and useful contents with a solid building, this is a choice (and all tiny turbos) for that.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2008-06-22T14:04:09.89Z","Odd Looking Tiny Turbo","I gave this set a 2 because the back half of the car looks unfinished. The 2 glow in the dark cheese wedges at the top of the windshield look out of place and strange. The same can be said for the engine that rests right up against the windshield. When I saw these sets on brickset earlier this year I was disappointed with this car. I purchased it with a Target coupon that was good for $5 off a $25 purchase so I got this set for free. There are great parts for MOCing with such as the blue cheese wedges, the car mudguards and the black plate with Racer Grille. Last summer I took parts from a Tiny Turbo set and created Tiny Turbo Go Karts. Check it out on my brickshelf page:

I decided to build this car without opening the bag. I read about challenges like this online and I finally decided to try an in bag build. I did it! You should try it if you get the chance. It is a little frustrating but worth it in the end when you have a completed model in the bag. The only thing missing are the stickers because they come packaged outside the bag.
I will take pictures of the completed model in the bag and put it in my brickshelf gallery. Good luck on your first &quot;in-bag build!&quot;",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"MetroiD","2009-01-18T10:48:14.593Z","Awesome parts!","This set has obviously received a decent amount of bashing, which in my point of view is quite unfounded. Bearing in mind that the set itself is a Tiny turbo, you can't really expect THAT much from it, now can you? 

However, in terms of bricks contained, this one is pure gold. It does not only come jampacked with great bricks for every car-building LEGO fan out there, but it also adds the unique glow-in-the-dark sloped lights... And at THAT price, you couldn't ask for much more than that.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
