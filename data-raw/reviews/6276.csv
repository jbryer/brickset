"Legonater","2007-12-17T20:47:23.153Z","What happened?","I find many of the new-er RACER sets are city-related. What happened to the traditional drone racing? That stuff was cool! But LEGO RACERS has left tyhat in the wind... and now other sets are taking over. And the Traditonal Tiny Turbos, with their own grages, those are going away too! And the CREATER X-pods? They are no longer pods! WHAT IS LEGO COMING TO? But anyways, I guess this is a good set.. but what happened to traditional racers?",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"jakelongdragon","2008-08-21T00:27:26.7Z","Great for racing and flying pieces!","If you like a wide variety of car and flying pieces then there plenty in this set will make you happy!

The set instructions give you 2 cool vehicles and a nice helicopter. The alternative instructions to make the other vehicles are fun but not really special. But to tell the truth this set is really best for parts! 

The set includes 8 wheels, 4 spoilers, fenders, airfoils, mudguards and rotating pieces. There are also plenty of technics parts, a clear cockpit window and 4 glow in the dark pieces. In short there is a lot here to add to your racing building collection. I have been using and reusing the pieces from this set in many different vehicles creations since I got it and I would say it was worth the money I spent just because of that.

Two small suggestions: 
(1) Save the stickers from this set for other sets/pieces. You'll be glad you did especially if you want to reuse the pieces. 
(2) Keep all the pieces from this set in one of those black plastic racer containers. They will all fit in nicely!

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-29T10:18:36.34Z","LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) - Speed Chasing Review","For a small set it does have some cool value. We get two small cars and a little helicopter. The vehicles are very sturdy and very easy to build and we also get some stickers. This set also comes with glow in the dark pieces which give this set a better value as well. The lime green car looks awsome and I love the way how LEGO designed the stickers. I'm not crazy about those stickers but they really bring the set to life - even if the bricks would be more valuable. The police car looks very cool as well with the glow in the dark police sign on the front and the chopper looks neat as well and all 3 vehicles can be maneuvered very easily. This set is a really fun set and you're also able to build a combination model.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
