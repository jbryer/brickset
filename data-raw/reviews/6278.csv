Pros
works well
looks cool
jumps over the blocker thing
fun to play with
Cons
None
a great buy and i think it's better than the desert hopper but that's my opinion
it also lands on all four wheels most of the time",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-05-24T14:41:24.967Z","Great car!","This car is very nice, as it has cool decals, a powerful pull-back motor, and cool black wheels! The ramp has a ""gate"" which can be easily smashed through when jumping!

Pros:

Cool car
Lot of cool stickers
Ramp
Cool wheels

Cons:

The ""gate"" is very fragile

Overall, a great car!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
