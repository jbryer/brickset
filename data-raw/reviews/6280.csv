This is a good looking racer, the color and graphics are very nice.
Nice detail with the cups making the mirrors.
The ramp is good and the car jumps very well.
Cons:
Low piece count.
Big juniorized pieces make the front of the car and the connection is not so sturdy.
The stickers are good looking but come off easily.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box size was on par with most $10 Lego sets from the time. Snazzy visuals- perhaps a bit cluttered and on the dingy and unprofessional side, but otherwise well chosen for this set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Immediately upon opening this set you will find... very little, to be honest. This set is rather light on parts, with a few large parts and a handful of smaller parts connecting them together. Of highlight is the pullback motor- as powerful as ever, these kind of motors are very popular to build sets upon.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes no minifigures... but oddly enough, two coffee cups. The addiction lives on!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Sadly, thanks to the amount of large parts, this set goes together rather quickly and simply. The build of the car focuses around sticking System pieces on top of the motor to form most of the styling and making a small Technic construction up front. The ramp is mostly built as a technic base to support the ramp- which itself is a thin piece of plastic printed. I would have liked for the ramp itself to be build out of actual&nbsp;pieces (such as Technic beams&nbsp;or large tiles).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While the build process leaves a lot to be desired, the end result is worth what little effort put into it. This model shows a good example of how &#39;juniorization&#39; and a simpler build process can be good- because the resulting car and ramp are very solid and playable, able to be easily tossed around and flung off each other. The pull-back motor works beautifully and as expected and, while forceful, doesn&#39;t fling the car so hard that it implodes upon impact with anything. I may also say that I personally like the pieces used for the engine block and the styling they give the car.</p>

<p>The suggested play is to try and launch the car off the ramp without hitting the flame pieces on either side. Thanks to the width of the ramp the latter objective is easy- but more often then not I found the car push the ramp forward then fly off of it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While not a shining example of complex build, intricate details, or perfect replicas, I feel that this set achieves exactly what it was designed for- to be a solid toy for children to play with. I myself had quite a bit of fun with this, and it was the perfect price and size to be given as a gift or bought with pocket money. It doesn&#39;t need to be the most amazing set ever- but it does what it does do very well.</p>
