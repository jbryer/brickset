i give 2 thumbs up for make Ferrari truck in TT scale. this is really good set.              
For this set:
- great truck with tiny spoke wheels
- tiny F1 car

cons:
- it's still using sticker.

but it's alright, so it's good to have this set!

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-13T11:16:42.78Z","LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) - Ferrari F1 Truck Review","This set is one of the coolest LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbo) sets which is licensed to ferrari. The built is fun and easy. The bags are numbered and we get a few stickers which you have to put on. The whole set is very sturdy too. We get a very cool finish line, a truck and only one formula 1 car. I really like the details on the sponsors and the truck looks really cool. The door in the back does open if you want to store the formula 1 car and the doors on the side open too if you want to take out the extra tyres. We don't get any minifigs and this set doesn't have much play features but it's still a cool set to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is a cool set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
