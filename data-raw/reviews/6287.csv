<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought this from another collector&nbsp; afew years ago, alongside the other Ferrari truck Tini Turbos set that came with a&nbsp;finish line. 8155 Ferrari Pit was released in 2008 as part of the Racers line. This set&nbsp;comes with a pit, 2 F1 cars, a truck with trailer, and a smaller pickup truck. That&#39;s 4 vehicles in total, in 1 complete package.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build: </strong></p>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward, mostly building with standard bricks and plates, mostly reds, blacks and greys. I do like some SNOT techniques used on the bigger truck and trailer. Took about 2 hours to build at a leisurely pace, nothing too fancy but nevertheless enjoyable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>Coming with 4 vehicles, there is plenty of playablility, bringing in the F1 cars to refuel, and to switch out tires, then race them back out. I do appreciate the stickered panels with &quot;FELIPE&quot; and &quot;KIMI&quot; written on, which correspond to real F1 drivers, although quite outdated by 2020 (this was 2008, remember!).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of stickers, this set really had a lot! And I mean a lot! Another gripe with the stickers is that due to age, and the material they are made from, in only 12 years, they have cracked and some have even ripped, not to mention the big stickers that the set places over multiple pieces. Another problem is that all of the cars rely heavily on stickers for their detailing, such as headlights, grilles, and sponsors. I am sure some of it could have been brick built like the headlights.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>Overall, 8155 Ferrari Pit is a solid set. It has decent enough vehicles and a fairly large building. It is at the mini scale so it doesn&#39;t take up too much space. It fits well with other Racers Tini&nbsp;Turbos at the same scale. If you can find it for less than $50, then I would recommend purchasing it if you get the chance.</p>
