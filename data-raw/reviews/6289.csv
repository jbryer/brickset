But hey, its the kanohi ignika so what can you do. the price is fair but any and it would be a rip.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-05-03T15:08:24.123Z","Toa of the Life, Toa Ignika","This is the toa form of a kanohi mask that was the main one in the storyline since 2006. This kanohi had a different shape, included in vezon &amp; fenrakk or vezon &amp; kardas set as the vezon's mask or in the Maxilos and spinax set, as two armors from maxilos. This is the final design of the mask, included on a toa body with a board. The playability is great if using the toa above the board, or simply using this alone. The set have useful contents for the bionicle theme, such as the blades on the board and with the toa, these that are:
1 power sword (from toa mahri jaller); 2 blades from the brutaka set; 2 Twin cutters (from toa mahri matoro or in a current matoran, kirop) and one blade(same as shadow sword from Mutran &amp; Vican, or aqua war blade from toa mahri Hewkii). Another useful contents are too the pieces used on technic or in bionicle sets or also the big sets (named titans or warriors) to connects with other parts, used in this set to make the board's structure. 

The toa ignika have too a midak sky blaster, included on the current toa nuva from the phantoka subtheme. This really shots spheres, the same from the zamor launchers(from 2006) in a silver color. The weapon shots very well and have an ammo of four spheres. Altough well desgined and useful to many bionicle hang, this is heavy, don't very great than the sphere launcher from 2006. The board too works very well, and the blades are good positioned, to make the board looks like with a board at the same time that this still in attack position. The armors of the toa were included previously, being useful now. This can too carry a matoran on back, like the other from the subtheme, to team-up with any matoran of Karda Nui. 

The playability is a pro of the set, the toa and his weapons are playable altough positioned in the board, and the blades are well positioned to don't hurt the hands when played. Another piece from the board is one on the back, half of the capsule from the bionicle playset &quot;barraki deepsea patrol&quot;, this is too well positioned altough odd in the design. Have many possibilities of playability, like play with the toa alone, the toa with the board, the toa with a matoran(from Karda Nui), or the toa with a board and the matoran. The price is good, but is better if with more contents, like the titans from 2006, these who had a bigger building with the same playability or more. Altough don't have much contents like Brutaka, Axonn, Gadunka or Hydraxon(these had the same price), this deserves a 4.7 or 5 of 5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"uberpuma1","2008-07-05T12:31:55.043Z","Surf Board Saved This Model","First off, you should know that I usually just take bionicle pieces and use them in other builds. I have never seen the attraction of little stick figures with weapons. For some reason though, I thought this one was different.

I walked by it in Target and saw that it was on clearance for 9.99USD and so I got a couple. (one to sell on ebay).

Went home, built it.  viola! it was done... and I wasnt too impressed... I will admit that somehow that stick figure is very dynamic and smooth looking while posed, but he just doesnt seem very lego-ish. 

The surf board is loaded with black technic plates, so if you were in the mood to build like... a technic batmobile/tumbler/batwing etc.. then getting a few of these might be a good thing for you.. (if you get the tow trasher you would get wheels AND plates though) Also if you like Battlestar Galactica, you could most definately use this helmet for the cylon raider.

All in all I gave it a three because its just not 10.00 worth of good, Much less 20.

Pros:
Gun could be used as an engine for a starship
Black plates could make any number of technic MOC's
Mask could double as Cylon Raider MOC
Blades are abundant in this model, so if you were looking for sharp silver pieces for wings or something, there are plenty here.

Cons:
This figure is like any other bionicle figure...  
Great set for parts (if you can find it below m.s.r.p.)

I give it a 3 based on the parts alone. Some parts exist in this set that could be used for some pretty cool builds, however, the set that they are intended to build is lacking. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"nmurray2","2008-07-18T16:39:24.357Z","good for $20.00","For $20 there is not a better bionicle you can buy! this set has the mask of life (which will be worth a lot in 4 or 5 years from now.), and an awsome sky-board thing. His sword is boring but the sky-blaster is fun and shoots far. He (I think it is a he anyway) has a great color scheme and a nice build that took me about 10 minutes. The wings on the board go in and out. Now on to the pros and cons.

PROS:
Fun build.
Cool color scheme.
MASK OF LIFE!
Long board flyer thing.
cool gun.
NO STICKERS!

CONS:
falls forward when riding
boring sword

Over all a good set that you can not afford to miss if you are a big BIONICLE fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vezon8764","2008-10-11T12:34:50.623Z","The most powerful Bionicle ever!","This set is SWEET! It comes with an actual Ignika, that was shown last year in gold, another Midak Skyblaster, and a sweet skyboard. Out of only this set, I created a clip-on jetpack, a snowboard, a rocketboard, and with Takanuva, a massive airship vehicle. Lots of rare pieces, such as Brutaka's swords, a rocket engine piece, and of course, the Ignika.
Pros:
Ignika mask
Excellent design
Sweet skyboard
Cons:
Another Skyblaster
No Matoran for him, even though he has the piece
I love this set very much. The only thing that I hated is that there was no Matoran, so I give it a 4.5/5. Get it if you see it!
See you next review!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-21T17:05:38.793Z","This guy is AWESOME","Okay, in a nutshell, this guy beats all except a chosen few Bionicles.  I love the skyboard.  The mask is nice addition to any Bionicle collection.

Pros:

Skyboard

Kanohi Ignika, Mask of Life

Gold and black color

Silver zamors in skyblaster

Cons:

None come to mind!

Get this guy!  If you think it's too expensive, well, save up! It's worth it!  Like, a lot!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-03-01T07:24:36.373Z","THE MASK OF LIFE!","The mas of life was inspired by Toa Matoro to make a body for itself. It is called Toa Ignika, after the Kanohi Ignika, of the Mask of Life. It also made a Skyboard for Toa Ignika to ride on, since Toa Igniia can't fly. Toa Ignika rarely speaks because he has not grasped spoken language.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-21T11:25:40.53Z","The Ignika's Body","This has to be my favorite warrior ever! He's even more play-able than Toa Mata Nui and Takanuva!

I'll start with the skyboard, his way of flying. I love how the wing can fold in and out. The skyboard has a cool design and has two Brutaka rotating blades, a power sword, and two twin cutters. At the back, there is a huge engine exhaust. It's fun to build and it isn't too easy and isn't too hard.

On to Toa Ignika, the mask of life's body. The Ignika is much better than the 2006 version. The storyline backround is, when it's turned silver, it's on the countdown to the universe ending. When I first got this, I wished there was a golden Ignika, but now there is Toa Mata Nui. The lifeblade is one of the best blades ever. Toa Ignika's shoulder armor is custom and also has those awesome lower leg guards. The midak skyblaster is my second favorite launcher. It shoots far, but won't stop when it hits the ground.

Pros:
Kanohi Ignika.
Lifeblade.
Fold out wings.
Many blades.
Shoulder Armor.

Cons:
NONE!

An awesome warrior! Get him if you can find him!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Also it comes with the Mask of Life which is a little disapointing because you have to use the red axle to conect it to the face and it falls off a lot when playing.
