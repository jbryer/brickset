Wish the blocks were printed (hate the stickers), and the van was 6 wide rather than 4. Really like the rear doors to the van. Simple set, easy to put together except for the stickers (pain in the neck). First time I can remember mail truck in the past 10 years or so since I've been collecting. Overall a good set, think it should be priced by LEGO at $5.99 not $7.99. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It's pretty small for the price (&#163;4.99 UK), but it makes up for it in UTTER COOLNESS!

Pros: Small but realistic like a real mail van. It has a compartment for mail and packages.  

Cons: the price is kind of unreasonable for a small set.

"Stash","2008-03-15T18:20:38.343Z","A great tiny set that should be ever so slightly cheaper.","
I happen to really like this set, however both this set and the Mail Plane (7732) have price points set too high based on the cost-per-brick. This set contains 66 pieces, which should put it at a price of 6-7 U.S. dollars reasonably, however it is priced at 8 USD (10 at Toys R Us unless on sale) increasing the cost-per-brick a decent amount over .10 (which I use as my target price). I happened to purchase mine on sale at TRU for 7 USD plus tax (which I imagine is about as good as it gets since it is 8 USD on lego.com). This set is priced far more reasonably than 7732, but still a touch too high unless you get it on sale.


The set itself has a nice design with good playability and has a few nifty accessories. 

The car:

The car has an interesting design and looks fairly sporty for a mail van, but I think it works pretty well. The rear of the truck has a nice cargo area with two outward opening doors that simulate the look of a cargo truck very well. There are some nice rounded/slope pieces that would be useful additions to a collection as well. The main problem here is all the stickers. This set has a lot more stickers than its counterpart 7732 and would have benefited greatly from printed pieces. Given the slight overpricing these pieces really should have been printed. 


Mini-fig:

The figure has a nice design with a new printed torso but the head is an older model being reused. I remember it was seen a lot in the Studio series on the director, though I cannot recall if it was used since then. He comes with a baseball cap accessory and several printed letter tiles which are very nice. 

Accessories:

The set comes with several printed letter tiles and a mailbox made out of the standard cargo container topped with a nice slope brick and a sticker for the front to indicate that it is a mailbox. I like the mailbox quite a bit (aside from the sticker) and it would be great to use in multiple spots across a town/city model. The one good thing about the sticker in this instance is that (aside from the slope piece on top) the sticker could be used to create mailboxes in other colors (like blue). 


Overall this is a great set. It fits perfectly in a small town and has some nice pieces that it would not hurt to have multiples of. The price is a touch high, but not so much that I wouldn't buy several of them, especially if on sale for 7 USD which is what I got mine for. Other than the multitude of stickers and the reused head design, the set is fairly perfect.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legobuilderguy","2008-06-01T22:57:20.687Z","Finally","This is one of those sets that you hope come out because you can't get the original one and you kind of need one of these. If you are building a city scene it's important to have certain elements to be more real to life if you will. And a mail truck with a mail box is one of those things. Now I have read the other reviews and I have to say that 7.99 for this wonderful set is not too much to ask for, .12 is not too much in my opinion at all. In fact I have two of these, one on the city street picking up mail and one at the airport waiting for a delivery. Pro's and con's time.

Pro's:
Nice little set
Easy and quick build
Looks good
A mini figure
Mail and mail box look good

Con's:
Only 2 letters, could have used more
Small cargo space but fairly easy to fix

All in all folks Legobuilderguy recommends this set to one and all who collect city because postal service is a must for a city to function properly.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"knuclear200x","2009-06-16T00:23:36.967Z","Special Delivery!!","Wow. Just look at it. I've never seen such a sleek van, with its...Scion-like design.

I've noticed lately that lego vehicles show a lot less pegs than back in the day. 

The circular wheel-guards have more authentic look than with the original mudguards or triangular pieces. Instead of a flip-top roof, it's just removeable and only the windshield's pegs hold it in. All while there is nice support in the back. Comes with a cool mailbox accessory and flat 2x1 envolopes that fit into the neat little slots. Mini-fig is nice too. The whole thing is probably a reference to the DHL mailing/shipping company.

Not only did I buy it for it's sleek design, but for its extra customizing potential. Just put the mailbox in place of the flat red blocks in the back, one side-rocket piece and an antenna on each side... and you got yourself a cool war vehicle. Awesome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2009-05-12T09:07:16.78Z","Van? Yes, Van","This set is to buy if you want to enlarge your city (After all, what is a city without a post office?) or if you have an army of wheelie.

Box : 3/5
Not ""catchy"", not attractive. The mail van seems ""boxier"" in the CGI rather than the real van.

Instructions : 4/5
Standard City instructions.

Building : 5/5
Very fun to build this set. You'll build the minifig, the post box, and the van.

Playability : 5/5
This set plays great! You can act as the postman, take the post from the back of the van, and drop it to the post box. It would be better if there's 2 post boxes, though.

Compare With Money : 4/5
US$ price is $7.99, I buy it for IDR 115,000 or equal to US$10.00, almost 150% the US price, it does worth the money, still.

Overall : 4/5
Good to span your City, it is also set to buy if you like / need bright yellow parts, plus you get a minifig with Steven Spielberg's head. Nice set with a van and a postbox, it does have a lot of stickers as a con.

"bryceg","2009-06-29T16:30:46.607Z","Awesome set! ","This is a fairly small set made by lego, but nevertheless is a great set.

It comes with one minifigure, 2 letters, and a mailbox.

The car is a small mail truck. I think they should have done a red, white, and blue one like the real one, but I wont complain. It has new wheels that roll a little bit better than the regular ones. The back opens up to a small compartment to put the mail in.

My only complaint is the the mailbox is kind of big but I can live.

"trumpet4751","2008-07-29T22:05:39.17Z","A Nice Addition to Lego City","The mail van isn't all that exciting, but it looks nice in a Lego city. First, the car is small, but it holds letters in the back and has room for one minifig. It has stickers, which we could all do without. The mailbox is awkward looking,and it also has a sticker. The minifig is cool, and fits with the set nicely. Overall, this is an easy set, and it's worth having.

"lotographia","2009-03-16T03:30:22.717Z","Is it a car? Is it a van? No, it's... car-van?","This is an odd set, in that the vehicle is too small to be a van but too van-like to be a car. It's a sort of in-between state.

The set includes a postie, some envelopes and a post-box, so it comes with everything you need to start a postal industry. A lot of sets don't include everything you would need to play with on its own - like, a doctor without a patient, a policeman without a criminal, etc.

Good for including everything you need, but the design of the vehicle will always strike me as slightly... odd.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>i got it exactly the day it was sold out in 2009 and i still have it in my lego collection,perfectly complete i lost one of the lego letters, heres my opinion.</p>

<p>.its good with the plane too but if you dont have the plane its still playable, if you got before it&nbsp;was sold out your lucky costs more than&nbsp;30.00 in u.s.</p>
<p>.it costed 7.99 when i got it,so if you find on a bid less than 20.00 try to bid for it at the last minute, there is a 95.99% chance youll&nbsp;win and if you find it in a garage sale grab it.its good for a stocking present for chritmas.</p>

"gigdoat2","2011-04-02T17:18:32.617Z","A simple yet great truck","<p>This is&nbsp;a neat set. I would recommend you to get it, so you can have a postal system in your town. First I'll review the minifigure, then the car.</p>
<p>The minifigure is good. He has a well-detailed torso with a letter logo and a zipper, which is very nice and detailed. He also has a belt, a shirt pocket with a pen and a cuff. He has plain black pants, and&nbsp;a plain red hat. His face&nbsp;have glasses and a thick grey beard. He is equipped with two letters.</p>
<p>The car is very nice. I like how the seat is a bit deep in it so the driver doesn't fall out easily. Its construction is different of those of other cars. Its wheels are like those of what they use on planes. There is a trunk, and you can keep letters in them. The trunk is a window piece, but the windows are solid and don't have openings. There is an antenna on top. Sadly, there are stickers.</p>
<p>Also, there is a mailbox, boosting the set's playability. The mail logo is a sticker. It is good there is a mailbox, you can add it to your houses that don't have mailboxes.</p>

"Nic1306","2020-03-01T10:04:19.25Z","Lego 7731 Mailvan, small but good","<p>The set may be tiny, but I think its still very good. The parts arent bad and there are not&nbsp;many stickers. The price was very good, so is the playability. The set has 66 parts and one minifig. The set got released in 2008, so one of the earlier city sets.</p>

<p>Minifig:</p>

<p>There`s not much to say about it, its a normal city minifig and no exclusive parts with it. But the minifig maches the set perfectly.</p>

<p>Building experience and parts:</p>

<p>The set has useful and cool parts, such as the three parts for the mailbox, also the van has some cool parts. The building experience was normal, what you excpect from a normal city set.</p>

<p>The build:</p>

<p>Its a very cute tiny mailvan. The van is solid and holds good. Only one minifig fits in the van. I really like this 90s look van with this round and curvy style.I think LEGO did a really good job on this.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>I really would recommend to buy this set, cuz as its nice (as already said)Also LEGO never made another mailvan since this one. Also the ebay Price of $28 new (stand february 2020) is quite reasonable. A small but good set.</p>

"RaiderOfTheLostBrick","2020-03-29T10:19:34.21Z","A Cute Little Van Which Needs A Remake","<p>This was my third or fourth set I ever got. My aunt brought it for me when she came to visit one time. I&rsquo;ve repaired it during my self-isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic, so I thought it would be nice to give it&nbsp;a review.</p>

<p>The Good:</p>

<p>This set is undeniably adorable. City mail sets are such a rare occurrence nowadays (though we have had a few here and there), but forunately the build does make up for this.</p>

<p>The minifigure is pretty nice.</p>

<p>Plenty of fun if you&rsquo;re a 5 year old.</p>

<p>The Mixed:</p>

<p>The main problem about this is its simplicity. The build process is pretty ABC with very few &lsquo;expert techniques&rsquo;. Given its small size though, I can forgive it.</p>

<p>The Bad:</p>

<p>Stickers</p>

<p>This set goes for about $100 sealed on eBay. This is not worth it for what you get here. It is simple enough to source the parts from Bricklink, but the stickers are another story.</p>

<p>Verdict:</p>

<p>This is an adorable set. I specifically remember playing with this a lot when I was just getting into Lego and it certainly makes up for the lack of mail sets in Lego City. My only real complaint is the basic building experience.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t recommend paying about $100 for this; AUD $60 is more reasonable I think. Or you can hunt the parts down on Bricklink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Otherwise, this is a pretty cute Lego City set.</p>
