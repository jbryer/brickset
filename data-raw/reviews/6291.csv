"Skut","2008-02-08T18:27:39.403Z","A few little flaws but nothing serious","This is a great set and, at AUD 13.99, good value too.  The set's looks are great, with a nice streamlined appearance which really evokes a real-life small twin.  Colour scheme is the simple (and, for Lego, traditional) red/yellow.  Playability is also very good, with a trolley included, easy access to the cargo area (which is large for the overall aircraft size).  The flaws?  Landing gear configuration is ridiculous, with the main gear much higher than the nosegear, giving the aircraft a very nose-high attitude on the ground.  You will need to source 4 2x2 plates to fix this (unless you want to do something more creative).  Plus the new window panes don't fit into the frames like the old version - obviously cost-cutting on Lego's part.  Also the wing loading seems very high - I couldn't get this plane to fly at all.

I happen to really like this set, however both this set and the Mail Van (7731) have price points set about 5 dollars too high based on the cost-per-brick. This set contains 88 pieces, which should put it at a price of 10 U.S. dollars reasonably, however it is priced at 15 USD (17 at Toys R Us unless on sale) doubling the standard cost per brick to .20 or so instead of .10 (which I use as my target price). I happened to purchase mine on sale at TRU for 14 USD plus tax (which I imagine is about as good as it gets since it is 15 USD on lego.com). 


The set itself has a nice design with good playability and is not lacking any essentials. 

The plane:

The plane has a large amount of cargo space for a small plane and is fairly well proportioned for a one person plane to the scale of the mini-fig. I would have liked to see the wings perhaps 1-2 studs longer as they appear slightly stubby, but it is a small thing to gripe about and does not detract from the set very much. The landing gear is a touch too high in the front but this can be easily evened out using a few common pieces. The window panes fit the plane well although perhaps a single window would make more sense with the scale of the plane instead of doubles.  

Mini-fig:

The figure has a nice design with a new printed torso and head with reflective sunglasses. He comes with a baseball cap accessory and a hand cart. 

Accessories:

The set comes with a new printed tile for packages, a handcart to move it around, and a baseball cap for the mini-fig. The printed tile is a great piece and if the set were cheaper would be tempting to purchase a few extra sets for (as well as other nice pieces such as the yellow 1x1 slopes on the engine housing and the hand cart).


Overall this is a great set. It fits perfectly in a small town that has a tiny airport but still needs to haul the mail (it could work in a larger airport but is definitely good for a small-town feel). The major detraction for me is that the price point is set unreasonably high for the piece count (88) especially with only one mini-fig. Nothing justifies the higher price. I would also love to see stickers done away with but since there are only a few in this set it is not as horrible as with other sets. For the extra price we are paying for this set we should have had nice printed pieces instead of decals and then it would almost be worth it. Due to the price this set gets a 4 out of 5, but with a price reduction could be worthy of a 5. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"_whateverist","2008-11-29T12:50:21.56Z","A classic design gone slightly wrong","I've loved Lego's small airplanes ever since I bought one on a flight to France. The old sets were pitch-perfect: straightforward planes that were scaled to the minifigs without looking too deformed.

This Air Mail set lives up to that ideal, but along the way it introduces a few design flaws that could easily have been avoided. The key problem of this set is Lego's new ratcheting roof pieces: while you couldn't put the old, normal-hinged pieces in any position you wanted like you can with the ratcheted ones, the new ones can't seem to be opened without accidentally ripping the hatch clean off.

A second minor problem are the side windows. The side of the cockpit is made up of standard small window pieces, and the upper part of their frame really gets in the way when you're trying to place or retrieve the pilot figure.

Look beyond these niggles though, and you're left with an excellent little plane. The red-on-yellow livery is cleverly done and doesn't rely on stickers save for the &quot;air mail&quot; logos, and those are confined to single bricks. There's room enough in the plane for the pilot, his cart *and* the mail box, albeit with a bit of squeezing and puzzling. 

Overall, the set looks good and it's a lot of fun. Shame about the flaws - a fifteen-year-old set like the Med-Star Rescue Plane managed to avoid them.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sikennedy","2008-05-21T18:52:54.233Z","nice wee plane, nice price","After so many terrible sets over the last 15 years its difficult to fault most of the city range, especially the stuff in the last 2 or 3 years. Again like many others, very frustrated about stickers! Please lego...just print em on! This is a good set though, the only weird thing is the wheel heights which means it tilts forward, a few 2x2 plates would have sorted it out, other than that its great. keep em coming lego",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legobuilderguy","2008-06-01T22:41:41.92Z","Great set","This is a great set that I was glad to see come out as it give me a chance to add a nice little plane to my airport collection. This is basically the plane that has been in all the limited edition sets in various color schemes with various insignia representing numerous airlines around the world. And since those have been reviewed to death let me say that if you need a nice little plane that can be used for small airstrips and that can carry a little bit of cargo this is the one. Price per piece is a little high maybe but if that is all you are concerned about then you will probably steer clear of this one, but if you like planes and want to have a really nice addition to the mail car then grab this one up.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-08-02T22:15:06.827Z","Great Plane!","I have just started the Airport industry in my Lego Town, and I badly wanted another plane to compliment my Police Pontoon Plane (7723). Toys R Us sold this to me at RM50 after discount (About $12) which is very expensive considering the size of this plane, but I bought it anyway.
The plane, if you notice, us only 4 studs wide (body).. and the cargo area is only 2x5 studs long. But however you can put alot of parcels inside, and the top of the plane has a hinged door that opens to let you chuck parcels inside. The hinged opening isn't very sturdy, you might as well take that whole part off because while trying to swing it open, it's bound to come off anyway. Minifig is great, love the 'cool boy' look with that sunglasses on.

If you notice this, you'll realize that this plane is really a tiny speedboat with wheels, wings, and a roof added on it. Anyone with a Paradisa Speedboat can convert it into a plane with the right parts and great imagination. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguysw","2008-12-22T04:20:42.31Z","Cargo plane or Personal Jet?","------------------------------------------------------------------
From the outside this little beauty looks more like a cargo plane than a personal jet. But infact, it works as each of those! (and at the same time as well!)
Let me explain. Inside the plane is:
1.A cockpit.
2.A 2X2 space behind the cockpit for cargo.
3.A slighty raised wall behind this, like a partition within the plane.
4.a 3X2 space behind this for Cargo.
Very cool! There is a lot of space in here for luggage, and it can be stacked up so there is a lot of room really.
But if you want another passenger seat, then:
1.This stays as a cockpit for the pilot.
2.This becomes a passenger seat.
3.The partition can either stay and make the plane more sturdy, or come out to make a litle bit more room.
4.This becomes a luggage compartment.
So, in 2 easy steps, this can be your very own Lego town't Mayor's private jet!
------------------------------------------------------------------
ANYWAY, onto the review.
The set comes with a pilot minifigure and a small 'package'
I mentioned the interior above so I'll leave that out.
The roof of the interior is very well done. Most of it cmoes off easily as it is on long, grey, smoove tiles like most modular houses have to let the roof come off easily. There is also a click hinge roof that comes up. This works very well most of the time. The cockpit also has a computer in it.
The wings are very good, and look like a real classic Lego plane's wings. The propellors stay on well. The back wings are very good aswell.
Overall, this i a very sturdy set, with good peices, an awful lot of room inside, and a brilliant classic look!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"_obelix_","2009-01-06T10:00:03.437Z","Air mail - away!","I just got this set, and i like it! A nice addition to any CITY fan's collection this set grew up to my expectations. It has a simple plane, mail man and a cart yes, BUT the simplicity of it is its beauty, AND it fits nicely with other mail sets. There isn't much point in saying how great this set is, just look at its marks...

A perfect 5 out of 5, from me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"claherre","2008-12-27T20:21:40.187Z","A good companion to 80s sets","After a lot of years, here we have a plane that looks similar to the mail &quot;subtheme&quot; of the 80s. I bought it as a complement to the 6362 post office and the mail vagon in the 7722 train. They certainly fit together, and now my town has a dedicated mail plane in the airport.

Anyway, I don't like the design 100%. I miss the old mailman jacket in the 80s sets and I think the front of the plane looks a bit odd.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"albcheng123","2009-09-18T11:53:59.45Z","Good Old-school aircraft Design","I bought the ""Air-Mail"" recently simply due to the following reasons:

1) It is not expensive of about US$11 to 12 to get an aircraft

2) Not many ""mail"" sets have been released in lego's history, and Lego released a mail van (7731) & a mail aircraft (7732) in 2008.  We are quite lucky to get 2 out of 5 ""yellow mail"" sets just in a year.
http://www.brickset.com/search/?query=mail

3) Old-school aeroplane design appears to be attractive, the previous ""old school aircraft"" set released by Lego could be ""Holiday Jet (Inflight)"" (4032) in 2003.

4) The set is highly playable with a mail-cargo, a trolley, a postman minifig in red.  Old-school aircraft sets should offer more fun to build........

<p>This is my first review and I&#39;ll make it a short one.</p>

<p>This has to be one of my favourite sets as a child. It is a sturdy build (didn&#39;t break when you held it, and was able to be thrown off of the back deck) and easy to hold in the hands. One of the things I loved about this set when I was younger for some reason, was the stand-up trolley. It was just a neat piece to move other pieces about. It was my first plane and I loved it.</p>

<p>Parents don&#39;t need to go and buy expensive sets or heaps of lego for their child, just get a few good little sets like this one, maybe a little firetruck (7942) and an ambulance (7942) and let your child&#39;s imagination do the rest of the work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope everyone found this review helpful in some way or even just a bit nostalgic.</p>
