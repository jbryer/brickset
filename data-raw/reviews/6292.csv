"Skut","2008-02-10T06:13:52.28Z","Best cargo truck ever","This is Lego's best ever cargo truck.  The truck itself is a Euro-style affair, in the new 6-wide format, with a 6 wheel front unit and a four wheel articulated trailer.  In a new design feature, the sides of the truck and trailer lift up for loading by the forklift.  The loads themselves are palletised and contain some suitable flammable-looking material - future work for your City firefighters!  The forklift is very functional as well as realistic.  At AUD40, the price is reasonable too.  Alot of play value here, particularly if combined with other cargo items (cargo train/cargo plane).  The only downside is the stickers - I like them but I know most people would rather paint the set decorations by hand than try to apply stickers.  Nonetheless, a great set and a City/Town classic.

"mrmitch","2008-03-06T15:29:33.153Z","Best new City set yet !","I picked up the truck and forklift set last week and I am impressed. The truck and trailers are 6 studs wide, this being a truck makes it a must. It is fills a much needed space in the newer City theme a Big Rig truck. I love the forklift, but can't figure out how to keep the forks in any position but all the way up(due to the spring). The new mini figures are detailed and unique. The truck does have stickers ( yuck ), but that is the only negative I can come up with. Fun model to build and play with a must for any City fan. To me this set is the best value priced set, I have purchased in the last few years. Buy it !!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legobuilderguy","2008-05-31T03:17:40.013Z","Good job Lego","Good job on this one Lego. This set is the perfect compliment to set #7734 of on it's own. This set includes not only a great truck but also a very good forklift. For those of us not into the train sets this is a boon. Not there is anything wrong with the train sets, I am just not into them is all. Now, back to the set review. When I started on this one I was impressed as the build was pretty straight forward and of course was built in parts. You built the fork lift, then the truck with trailer and the tag-a-long trailer. This set does not only go with the cargo plane but also looks great with the Harbor set #7994. Now, onto the pros and cons of the set.

Pro's: 
Great looking set
Top of the cab is the new single piece
Great looking forklift
Lot's of cargo

Con's:
Well, only two minifigs, could have used one more
Stickers not printed parts
No doors for the truck (still not a big deal to me)

All in all a great set and worth the purchase price. Also don't feel like you have to have either the harbor or the cargo plane to get alot of fun from this set. They enhance the fun of the set but aren't required to make this a winning purchase.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"legomaniac","2009-08-31T00:21:00.25Z","Better than expected set, but tiny stickers","I really like this set, although the truck looks too familar to other lego trucks, reminds me of a Scania.

The container for the truck could of been made 2 studs longer to be the same size as the trailer, so it can fit on top of each other.   

I love the forklift, first time I finally get one and its very detailed.

Had to use tweezers to put on the stickers, they were way to small


But overall I love it, i can stuff other lego cargo other than pallets in it, and I like the green, so used to white red and yellow legos",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BrickPiet44","2008-12-28T16:10:25.497Z","Excellent set, best city set since years","This is a great set! Lego has returned to sets that combine all the best features of the Lego sets of the 1970s and 1980s. The list of pro's is long, the number of con's is short.

Pro's:

- the truck is well designed. It is 6 studs wide, as all new sets. This is one of the greatest improvements by Lego of recent years. The green color is a good addition the the other colours of other sets (usually white, red, yellow). The front of the truck looks good. The top of the truck contains a high roof as many real trucks do.

- The cargo bays are spacious and very well accessible. The opening mechanism works well and is really inventive for this kind of set.

- The doors of the cargo bays work well. Only monir point is that the 'top hinges' have to be handled with some care because if you don't, they come off easily.

- The fork lift looks very good. The lift itself works good and is large enough for the vehicle.

- Two mini figures, as should be, one for the truck, one for the fork lift.

- Three - not one as could be expected, not two - bu three pallets with different cargo's. And cargo's that look like real cargo's.

- Good value for money: in shops usually around 25 euro's, in The Netherlands in some internet shops available for around 20 euro's.

- Great playability with 3 vehicles i.e. a truck, a trailer and a fork lift, two minifigures and lots of cargo.

The con's:

- Stickers on the sides of the cargo. Stickers on the truck and the fork lift as well. They're bound to get dirty and get off. Serious minus points for this!

Overall picture can only be if ratings could be higher than 5 this set would get a 6.

The advice can only be simple: get this set! It's the best city set since years, perhaps the best lego set since years.

"claherre","2008-12-27T20:27:18.92Z","Very realistic...","I bought this sets primarily because of the forklift. Also, I wanted a try with the new vehicles (6 studs wide) coming from Lego. They certainly look better and a lot more modern.

"lotographia","2009-04-29T07:39:26.64Z","An update to the vehicles in the cargo train set.","The best way to review this set is to think of it in relation to the latest cargo train set. Both sets have the same pallet design; both sets include a truck and a forklift.

Although I like the cargo train set very much, the truck and forklift in this set outdo the ones from the cargo train set in every respect. The forklift looks much more like a forklift, although it's slightly out of proportion with other lego vehicles. The truck in the train set is slightly too flat, making the cabin look too low to the ground. This truck is a great improvement.

I mentioned that the pallets had the same design, and that is my favourite aspect of this set. After two years, Lego carried the design from one set to the next. It really seems like the Lego company care about us long-term lego collectors and our need to have sets that match each other.

I do have some slight problems with this set though, like the fact that it's hard to get the container doors to close properly, they always seem to jut out slightly. Also part of the rear container is kind of flimsy, and I would have liked for the pallets to be secure inside the containers.

Apart from those minor details, I couldn't hope for a better truck to transport the product of my farm to the markets.

Note: if you want to make sure you put all the stickers in the right place, build the rear container first. A green block serves as a guide to the correct positioning of the big 'cargo' stickers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Noworrys","2009-08-24T17:47:26.513Z","Truck neat - Trailer weak... Great Forklift anyway!","This Set is a 3 overall.

First about the PRO's:

- Great Truck! Looks just fine, feels just fine - No doors, but very solid indeed. No Seat but lots of space

- Great Forklift - I only knew the old forklifts, so the new mechanics are very nice and fresh. Nothing to compare about on this one

- Color is fine for Cargo Theme, but as a display model this is a bit anoying. Just wont fit...

I'm sad, there are a lot of CON's:

- The Trailer is disgusting! The look is odd and it does just not fit. Model would be better as a 40t Truck...

- C'mon - 3 paletts of cargo and just space for 2 of them..

- Those stickers are a real pain - quite hard to get them lined up on the model.

- I just cant figure out what this kind of ""Atomic Bomb Style Looking"" Thing should be?

- The cargo doors of the truck just wont stay in place, really anoying.

Anyways, for the price of 15€ you get a lot of truck and a lot of parts. I wont recommend this for a beginner set but for a complete collection its fine.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Cons 

Forklift forks are tough to connect to the forklift

It was an easy build compared to other sets but i just cant over the price. Also it is perfect for any city. So if you are creating a city like me then buy THIS set. It works really well with the harbor aswell. I might even buy 2 of them",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-11-01T10:08:10.077Z","Cargo Carrier…","I was looking through the Lego catalogue when I noticed this set (7733) and thought was a great addition it would be to my collection of City vehicles.   I looked everywhere for it, all the usual places such as Toys ‘R’ Us, Argos, John Lewis, I had even looked when I was out and about on business but never saw it.   So I turned to eBay and low and behold there it was.   I think I paid a little over the odds for it (£24.99) but I thought it was going to be the only way to get hold of it so I bought it.   I have not been disappointed with it, it’s a great set, goes so well with the other trucks of the same scale and it looks right at home on the forecourt of the City Garage (7642).   To be honest, the set is more than just the truck; there is the forklift and the various pieces of cargo, so as usual I’ll separate the review into the following sections:

The Truck:

The truck is very typical of the many drawbars which can be seen travelling the length and breadth of the country along the motorways and in / around ports and docks.   The main truck features three axles, a small cab which can seat the supplied driver and the rear container unit.   The cab can comfortably seat the driver along with his coffee cup.   The windscreen is a solid one-piece affair to which the fully adjustable wing mirrors fit.   The high grill features lights, vents and a bumper with number plate attached.   The design of the lower area under the cab means that there appear to be ‘steps’ for the driver to use when entering / leaving the cab, very clever design.   Just behind the cab, on the road level are various tanks and lockers, there is also a vertical exhaust and large antenna.   The roof of the cab is a one-piece design and features the ‘Transport’ logo and associated graphics.   The container unit nudges up to the rear of the cab and has a full-length opening hatch allowing various pieces of cargo to be loaded / unloaded by the supplied forklift.   The hatch, when closed makes a good connection and remains in the ‘closed’ position even when the vehicle is ‘driven’.   The container unit follows the same white and lime green colour scheme of the cab and also requires various graphics to be attached, warning chevrons are also supplied to be attached to the rear of the container.   The trailer container unit is attached to the tractive vehicle and again follows the sane white and lime green colour scheme.   The trailer has a steerable haul axle at the front end and one fixed axle towards the rear of the trailer.   Like the main container unit, the trailer unit features a full-length opening hatch allowing more pieces of cargo to be loaded / unloaded, again the connection when ‘closed’ is good.   Graphics are also attached as are warning chevrons and a set of lights and rear number plate.

The Forklift:

The forklift is very modern in appearance and surprisingly robust.   This vehicle has a red and black colour scheme and a small cage in which the operator can sit.   Behind the operators seat is the counter-weight area.   Two spotlights face forward towards the upright mast onto which the forks are attached.   A load apron ensures that the load is correctly balanced.   Two small antennae and a simple amber beacon complete this mini-set perfectly.

The Accessories:

The set features two minifigs; the truck driver who is dressed in grey trousers and a blue sweater, and the forklift operator (with handheld CB radio) who wears overalls and a red hard hat, he also has various ‘tools’ tucked into his overalls.   There are three pallets of cargo which can be moved using the forklift.   The first pallet contains various boxes of ‘cargo’; the second has what appears to be a double tank (in Octan colours) with a grab rail, meter and vent.   The third pallet support what look to be three ‘toxic’ barrels, well they seem to be ‘glowing’ a little!

Overall, an excellent set, so much seems to be included in this set, and it’s so much more than just a truck!   If the City trucks are your thing then you won’t be disappointed with this one…",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legofan3810","2010-07-04T14:53:26.43Z","Lego Cargo Truck","I think Lego took a big step up in Cargo with this one. I love this set. It has many details, and playability. It is a great set which includes many features. I love every part of this set. This set will deliver, not disappoint.<br><br><br>The Figures<br>The figures are fairly decent. The truck driver is wearing a plaid buttoned shirt, sunglasses, and gray pants and he has brown hair. The forklift driver is wearing blue overalls, with little tools tucked in the pockets, blue pants, and a hard hat. He has a thin shave around his face, and has your average, ""you can count on me"" face. 5/5<br><br>The cargo stuff<br>I find the cargo to be the best part of the set. Not only does it look realistic, it has some nice pieces as well. One of the cargo is a trio of three boxes, two of them say cargo all over them (STICKERS) , and the third one has a warning sticker on the top. The other one, is a very odd piece of machinery with a pressure dial (not a sticker) Unfortunately, i don't know what it is. My favorite cargo is the one with three tubes. They each have a yellow transparent circular brick in the middle, which i find very interesting. I think they are atom bombs. 5/5<br><br>The forklift<br>I think the forklift is a great addition to the set. It has a lifting mechanism piece which you attach to the forklift to make it look realistic. It has a ladder roof, a light on top of it, which i like, and two of those antenna yellow pieces. There is a seat for the driver, with a steering wheel. On the back there are two red lights and two curved pieces. 5/5<br><br>The truck<br>The truck is very cool. It has a seat inside and steering wheel. It has lights lights on the front and back. There are some cool looking stuff on the sides that look like stuff you see on trucks. The container unit can be attached to the truck and can hold one cargo. It opens up one one side to put in the cargo. The same is for the trailer but you can put in two pieces of cargo in it because it is slightly larger.
