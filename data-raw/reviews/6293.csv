"benners30","2008-01-09T18:19:41.56Z","huge!","ok this is one of the finest planes of 08. it is for one huge, and very detailed!it has a fair price tag but i promise u its worth every penny. im gonna break this review into sections for maximum quality.

airplane:
the airplane is very large and sports 4 gingantic propellers, large wings, and great details. the fuesalage mainly consists of the 06 cockpit,floor, roof,tail and wing pieces but in a vibrant and trendy color green. it has one small door for the crew and a larger door for the main cargo. the doors are an intresting kind. they swing up. this is new for lego 06/08 airplanes as we are more used to the 4 stud wide swing doors. but then again, how would you fit in the pallets in doors that only have about 3 stud clearance? anywho, the airplane boasts a fair amount of space, a good design and good playability. plus it has large landing gear to make for a smooth landing.

ground equipment/figs.
the ground trucks and equipment are some of the best iv ever seen. they are realalistic, pretty sturdy and cool. starting with the truck. the truck is very flashy and features a hitch for the other 2 modules. cool lights and realalistic features like gear sticks and the works.it is a nice bright and flashy yellow in color and goes good with the equipment from 7894 and 7893. we also have a small moveable staircase to board the plane. it isnt much more than a ladder on wheels with a hitch up attached but hey its sometihing. finally we have the container loader. it is simple yet highly effective using a system of bar pieces attached to the wheel base and the cargo platform. once again we have a hitch up so it can be pulled around with the truck. we have three figs. a pilot and 2 ground crew. the pilot sports a blue jacket and hat unlike the 2006 pilots. the ground crew have blue pants and caps with cool orange jackets.

overall this is a great set. oh by the way, the plane is 50cm long!   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Skut","2008-02-09T00:42:38.7Z","Great set with some annoying flaws","This is a very good set.  It is not an all-time classic for the reasons I will go into below, but it is definitely worth it for the City fan or any parent whose kid likes planes.  Now, let's break it down...

Looks: These are a ten out of five.  It's hard to appreciate until you have built the plane, but something about its lines just seem to WORK.  It is one might fine looking plane.  Very &quot;swooshable&quot;, which is quite an achievement for a cargo aircraft.  The green colour scheme really works well, too.  I'm already considering a custom &quot;Jolly Green Giant&quot; name sticker!  The support vehicles aren't pretty, given they are built for utility not speed, but are appropriately similar to their real-life counterparts.  

Price:  At AUD80, this is a tad on the high side for what you get so make sure the kids are likely to get alot of play out of it.  AUD60 would be a fairer price. 

Build:  A good, fun build, not too long either (a bit over an hour).  However the stickers will annoy some people no end, particularly as they are in critical locations if you stuff them up (nurse, tweezers, STAT!)

Playability/features: Let me start this section by saying that I think any kid is going to get alot of fun out of this set.  However I think a few features let this set down.  There is no cargo space in the middle of the aircraft - ie. between the two doors you can see on the photos.  The area is taken up entirely by the wing box.  I think this is an adverse feature of the new wing - perhaps it should have been designed as 2 separate wings but too late now I guess given that Lego has shelled out on the moulds and tooling.  Otherwise Lego should have placed the wings lower or higher to allow for a larger cargo hold.   

The other frustrating thing is that, by choosing propellers rather than turbines and with a low-riding landing gear, Lego has gone for more of an &quot;airlifter&quot; look and feel to this set, like a C-130, in contrast to a &quot;jet freighter&quot; such as a 747F.  However the model comes with none of the fun &quot;airlifter&quot; features that would have added to playability such as a swing tail (or nose) or a rear ramp.  Instead we get (new) freighter-style doors which , though very good in themselves, aren't as much fun as raising or swinging the whole nose or tail.  

The support vehicles are appropriately functional.  The raisable cargo loader platform is a nice touch. 

Other features worth mentioning: new crates are excellent; new nosewheel design is fantastic; main undercarriage is extremely poorly finished underneath; you will need to add bricks/plates to the underside if you want to remove the wheels for a long &quot;gear up&quot; flight.  

So, in summary, good set, well worth getting, but could have been so much more.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Lost_Cosmonaut","2008-02-12T03:47:50.687Z","Excellent set!","Just finished building this set and I'm very impressed.  Compared to the passenger plane (7893), this plane is EXTREMELY sturdy and well engineered.  The styling is great, I love the heavy lifter effect of the large turboprop engines and chunky landing gear.  My only complaints are 1) the rear landing gear (I really really wish it could retract somehow, or had swappable pieces to improve the &quot;gear up&quot; look, but most people will only ever display this as on the ground with all the support vehicles so this is pretty minor, really.) and 2) mine was missing one of the large roof pieces.  Other than that it's really a great set with the very nice swing open cargo and passenger doors.  The support vehicles are very nicely designed and use some new pieces!  They go perfectly with the whole set.

Also a must have for this is the cargo truck with the fork lift (7733), which is also a very nice set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-03-07T20:54:59.717Z","Best in Class and Flight","This set is the best model of the large city planes, beating the red and blue ones by a great deal. It's definitely much more stable than the other planes, that's for sure. It has two stashing places for cargo. The rear storage area is intended for the package rack and the front storage is for miscellaneous items. It also includes three minifigs, a loading platform for cargo, and a runway staircase. Might I also suggest to buy this specific set at Toys R Us stores, considering I got mine ten dollars off.",FALSE,4,3,3,4,4
"Legobuilderguy","2008-05-31T03:02:53.75Z","Another good set","This is another good addition to the Lego City collection. The turbo prop engines are a nice touch and the fold up doors are great. The color scheme took a bit of getting used to but I think it's great. This set comes with some great accessories which I think make a for great playable set as well as great compliment to any airport. A boarding ramp, a cargo platform that raises to aid in loading and of course the little car to pull them to and from the plane. Now the pro's and cons of the set.

Pro's:
Great all around plane
Nice accessories
Turboprop engines
Nice build

Con's:
One pilot, should be two
The middle of the plane is just empty space

That's the list folks. For those of you looking to add to your airport and have the passenger liner (also only one pilot..sheesh) this looks great next to it on the runway.

"Sammael","2009-01-02T07:39:00.123Z","Great-looking, but maybe a bit too juniorized and too big","First of all, this is my first set review on Brickset, so please bear that in mind.

While this is the first new-style 8-wide plane I bought, I do own 7732 Air Mail, and I own the classic 6392 Airport, so I am not entirely without experience when it comes to aviation-related sets.

The set consists of the plane, three minifigures, and an airport cargo vehicle comprised of three sections.

Plane:

The plane is quite impressive, with a nice (and unusual for Lego) color scheme that follows the general cargo/transportation color scheme also present in sets such as 7733 Truck & Forklift and 7992 Container Stacker. 

Its gigantic size means that it's more to scale with minifigures, but it also means that it will be hard to display this set together with the more moderately-sized city buildings.

The overall look is great, very streamlined, sleek, and aerodynamic, thanks to the huge cockpit/tail pieces and wings. While the huge pieces certainly help the looks, they do detract from the overall build experience, particularly the wings which are cast as a single piece. Because of that flaw, the entire mid section of the plane is basically built only to support the wing assembly. In my opinion, two separate wings would have greatly improved the playability of this set and allowed for more detail to be added to the mid section.

The plane is relatively sturdy, though the cockpit and tail section have a tendency to separate if pressed too hard. Part of the undercarriage which holds the back wheels is pretty unstable and pops off if you look at it funny. I think that another 1x4 dark bley tile would have helped there. Wheels do not retract into the hull.

The plane lacks an interior, except for the cockpit (which has three computers, two levers, and two chairs). In the back, there is a tiled area which allows the palette with cargo to slide in and out.

There are entirely too many stickers. I would have greatly preferred printed parts. 

Minifigs:
Three minifigs come with this set: the pilot (blue pilot torso, blue hat, dark bley legs) and two workers (orange worker torso, blue baseball hat, blue legs). They suit their purpose, and it's nice that three are included with the set (since two would have generally been enough), but they aren't all that special.

Cargo vehicle:
This nifty little vehicle consists of the main car and two trailers - one trailer holds the stairs used to reach the plane's cockpit, and the other has a platform for lifting cargo. The vehicle is simple and effective, and looks very nice (mostly yellow and bley). 

In addition to the plane, minifigs, and cargo vehicle, the set comes with two dark bley crates, two brown parcels, two tan parcels, and two white parcels. Not all this cargo will fit on the palette.

Overall, I recommend this set - but before you buy it, please consider if you have enough space to display/store it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"FatSammy","2009-01-04T12:35:04.577Z","Close, but no Cigar","This is an airplane. It can also be an..... airplane. Yeah. This set is really cool, if it is on a shelf. The playability of this set is high, but I don't see how the game differs the second or third time you play with it. The set tells the story: Someone loads the luggage, someone loads the passengers. The Pilot hops in. The plane flies and then lands. The cycle would start again. Of course, isn't that how a real airport works? Personally, I think that a design like this could be cooler, but I really don't see how. I think if you tossed in some LEGO Agents in with this I think it may be what it is lacking, but is that what this set is aiming for? You decide. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"japkleine","2009-01-04T16:28:35.17Z","My son loves it, but ...","... the problem is that there are always parts falling of. That's also the reason why I give only 4 out of 5 points. 
As I said above, my son loves playing with this set, but every minute or so Me or my wife have to come to put parts back that have fallen of. 
I personally like the set, if you just display it it looks great. The little car witht he trailers are pretty cool, they have a great stability and are fun to play with. 
If LEGO would do something about the parts that easily fall of, then I would give this set a 5. It is frustrating after a while to always put parts back on.
But otherwise, I recommend to buy it, it will always excite children and they will love to play with it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"craigpowers","2011-11-16T00:18:01.143Z","A Cargo Plane that looks like it can actually carry cargo - well, looks like it at least","<p>Back in 2006 when I first saw the Lego 7893 Passenger Plane, I was off-put by the use of the very large, one-piece nose, tail and wing sections that made up the behemoth. &nbsp;Yet, the more I looked back on that set, the more I began to like its lines and came to the realization that, at least, Lego made the plane look good, even if it seemed to defy everything that Lego was about. &nbsp;And then I saw this set. &nbsp;The green color scheme; the twelve wheel rear landing gear; the high wing configuration; the enormous prop engines. &nbsp;I had to have it. &nbsp;The thought of a Lego cargo plane that looked like it was actually capable of hauling cargo was too much to pass on. &nbsp;I had two copies of Lego 6375 cargo plane as a child, which is the old-school, tiny jet plane that Lego used to make. &nbsp;They were great fun, but they were hardly a ""real"" cargo plane - more like a BAE-145 converted to hauling a handful of parcel packages.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Size/Scale. &nbsp;Although many Lego fans detest the enormity of the latest jets and large planes Lego has been pumping out, I have actually grown to love them, collecting almost all of them in sheer jubilation over the fact that Lego airplanes, now, are about the size of real airplanes. &nbsp;Given that this is supposed to be a cargo plane, it only makes sense that it be big. &nbsp;The largest flying aircraft in the world are all cargo planes (AN-225, AN-124, C-5).</li><li>Detail/Construction. &nbsp;One thing I have come to appreciate with the newer aircraft from Lego is a larger, more realistic cockpit and this one delivers, offering seating for pilot and co-pilot and numerous display panels and throttle controls. &nbsp;However, Lego has yet to put a yoke in their planes, but even these are becoming a thing of the past in real aircraft, as more are going to fly-by-wire controlled by tiny joysticks. &nbsp;The hinged cargo doors are very well-executed and are not at all intrusive when trying to access the interior of the airplane. &nbsp;The decision to go with prop engines may disappoint a few, but I think it is a nice departure that sets this airplane apart from the other models (also, the C-130 is one of the most widely used cargo planes today and it is a four engine, propeller-driven aircraft).</li><li>Ground Crew/Cargo. &nbsp;As if the plane wasn't cool enough, Lego did a knock-out job on the support vehicle and the cargo pallet. &nbsp;Both are very well-constructed and have high playability, especially when combined with Lego 7733 Truck &amp; Forklift.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Wings. &nbsp;The biggest drawback for this set, for me, is the wingspan. &nbsp;It looks like the wings have been clipped just beyond the last pair of engines. &nbsp;Where the passenger plane (7893) and even the Indiana Jones Plane (7683) have winglets that extend the overall wing length, this set was tragically left out of that group, and would benefit greatly from wing extensions, especially given that propeller-driven airplanes tend to have larger wings.</li><li>Blocked-off midsection. &nbsp;This has been discussed several times in other reviews of this set, and I was well aware of it before buying the model myself, so I knew what to expect. &nbsp;But the fact that Lego completely blocked off the mid-section under the wing roots is really a disappointment for many builders, myself included. &nbsp;However, looking at the assembly, I understand why Lego chose to do this, at it provides better support and stability for the wings. &nbsp;But it's not a deal-killer for me, and, like I said, the plane at least LOOKS like it could carry significant cargo.</li></ul>
<p>If you haven't gotten your hands on this set already, good luck, because it will cost you a pretty penny (my acquisition off eBay certainly wasn't cheap). &nbsp;But I feel it was worth every penny what I paid for it, given that the plane is really a sleek, attractive aircraft that really lends to the busy airport theme that I am working on. &nbsp;If you are an aviation buff and Lego fan, it definitely belongs in your set; how badly you want it, however, will determine what you will shell out for it, because there are plenty of people willing to pay over $100 for a used copy.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
