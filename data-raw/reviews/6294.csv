"bmwlego","2007-12-24T12:45:56.153Z","So happy that LEGO is creating these Tiny Vehicle Sets","LEGO has added this and the Mini Trains to their product line and I couldn't be happier. This truck is beautifully designed and the mini car is so simple anyone can build it. This set serves as an inspiration for more smaller scale vehicles. Not quite micro scale but not minifig scale either. The choice of orange really brightens up this set and I am thrilled that there are orange cheese wedges as well. 8 wheels in this set also add to the possibilities. There is a 1x4 clear brick that makes up the windshield of the main model that I didn't have in my brick collection before. I can't wait to see what else LEGO releases in this theme later this year.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Built the crane truck.  10 Minutes of good fun whilst watching the telly.  The lift arm moves up and down but with a few extra parts should be easy to make it turn from side to side.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

For me, the right scale should be a minifig scale.<br>But for this set, I am willing to make an exception.<br><br>I really like the color combination of the truck. And I really like the details the designer create for this set.<br><br>Really wish that they will come up with something like this truck for the minifig scale. That will be really interesting.<br><br>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-08T10:22:14.85Z","LEGO Creator - Mini Vehicles Review","This set is very easy to build and we also get instructions for 2 other models which you can build with the pieces of this set. We also don't need to worry about stickers. The orange car and the truck are very fun to play with and to maneuver. The little vehicle is also able to fit on the trailer of the truck. It's a nice set to have and I can't complain much about it - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Firox_5000","2010-09-25T15:41:30.4Z","A Truck and a car","<p>This is one of the mini sets that came out in 2008. You can built 3 models a truck and car, off roader and tow truck. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The car and truck is the best model and is really good. The detail is spot on for a mini truck and is absolutly amazing. The car however is sort of the opposite it does not look much like a car but yet does not look too bad. &nbsp;But yet the playability is pretty good. ar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tow truck does not look too bad and has a function with the crane at the back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The four wheel looks a bit retro but yet is quite a nice little car.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is very good and I suggest you try and find a retailer that still sells them and buy it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
