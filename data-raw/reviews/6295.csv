I am happy to report that it didn't disappoint. It is beautiful. The use of wheels to create train wheels is brilliant. I truly enjoyed building this set's main model. I am so glad that the main color is green. There are even dark green cheese wedge pieces! This might be a set that I buy multiple times. I have many larger wheels (like the ones that come with this set) but no tires for them (a friend bought me a pick a brick bag) that I can now use to build similar train engines. This is a brilliant set and one that I hope LEGO adds to later this year in the form of more 3 in 1 Creator train models. Great job to whoever designed this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"JC3275","2008-01-25T19:59:57.607Z","Great set","A friend bought this set for me because they knew my passion for Lego.  It was a pleasure to build and looks great sitting on my shelf.  I agree with the previous poster. I'd like to see more train cars and accessories to follow up on this little gem.  Thanks to my friend, and thanks to LEGO for putting out this nice set.  I'm partial to sets with minifigs. That never crossed my mind, neither while building this set, nor while admiring the finished product.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Paradosis","2009-06-16T01:55:53.89Z","Great Creator Set","I would recommend this excellent set, if only for the main model. The train engine is a fantastic build, very fun to put together, and aethetically pleasing when finished. The set has a great color scheme of green, black and light grey, with dark grey and white accents. The other two models (train cars) are not terrible, but they're definitely not up to the lofty standards of the main model. I'd give the set an 86/100.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"TinyHippo","2009-01-03T11:56:44.653Z","Clever design, excellent colour scheme.","I've given this set top marks due to the idea of the title. For a low price, you receive a good selection of pieces - in colour and style - as well as an excellent primary model. 

Pros: 

Lovely primary model.
Excellent pieces.
Decent value for money.

Cons:

Other two models: not anything special.
Not enough dark green. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jakelongdragon","2008-08-03T11:35:11.59Z","All aboard!","This is a really nice set and very fun to play with. The 3 models are realistic and if you get many sets you can build a complete train with locomotive, cargo, etc...You can even attach them to each other using the connectors! The special parts are great and you get 8 wheels of 2 different sizes. 

Note: The plastic container box is big enough to contain 3 or 4 sets if you want to bring them with you!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MetroiD","2009-01-26T12:50:58.06Z","Marvellous set","This set can brighten the day of any LEGO fan, even if they're not all that enthusiastic about trains and railways.

It's very cheap, comes neatly packaged in a plastic box like all small Creator sets do, but what's so special about it is that it has an absolutely marvellous color scheme. That, and the great design ideas that are shown in the manual, turn this one automatically into a must-buy if you see it in your local store. Trust me, you will never regret buying this set - more likely you'll learn a few neat building tricks that you could use on your own creations!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-08T10:16:51.38Z","LEGO Creator - Mini Trains Review","This is a fun little set to have and it's nice to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This set has instructions for 2 other trains which you can build. This train set may doesn't have any play features but it's still fun and easy to maneuver it.    As I told you in the beginning: This is a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"time1513","2009-12-15T01:58:51.89Z","Mini Train ","I was a bit surprised when i actually got this set. i was trying to complete all my mini creators then i stumbled upon this set and told myself i should buy this set because i was trying to complete everything (Mini Creators). 

when looking at the picture in the box you won't really feel the excitement of getting it but after building it i was caught off guard cause it looked very big compared to the other mini sets. i also like the color that they used and the parts in it. i like the part when they have the connectors in it. (if u buy two of these then can actually form a train with it.) 

the only downside with it is that it's not really playable (unless you have a track). 

but overall it's a nice set with a lot of surprises! :D",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Firox_5000","2010-09-25T15:29:14.643Z","Choo Choo!","<p>I would easily say this has to be the best mini creator set made even to this day. it may be small but the detail&nbsp; is fantastic. You can be build three individual models of your choice either a steam train,diesal train and tram. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steam train model is amazing and is very neat with it's good amount of detail. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the diesal locomotive is also very nice and also has high detail to it. The tram model is pretty good as well not quite as strong as the other two but is still pretty good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest getting this set if you get chance it is really good and i still love it just as much since I first bought it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"tkettle9719","2012-01-12T14:31:40.437Z","The Mini Emerald Night","<p>I got this set for Easter from the Big Bunny, and think that this is a truly excellent mini-model, for both play and display. Buy two and you have the train and the car. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-Very traditional steam train look is very nice.<br></li><li>-The greens are a very welcome addition to any collection.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-I wish that there was more green.<br></li><li>-I also find the choice of the 1x1 transparent yellow tiles an odd one.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a great example of a small set in an excellent form, and think that this is simple greatness. I highly recommend this for all train fans (this is superior to Thomas any day)!<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
