"arturovega","2008-02-05T11:49:17.14Z","Nice set","I got this set in Lima/Peru, South America... Paid the equivalent of US$ 30.00

Great set, it looks pretty nice, very playable and  functional. Nice 2 cyl engine, suspension system and others.

I highly recommend this set!

"Flying_Dutchman","2008-02-13T07:00:45.873Z","Not entirely perfect, but good enough.","OK, it's a nice bike with OK features and the build was fun too, but with 8420 still in my mind, it came a bit short on a few points.

First of all, the engine is attached to the frame with only two technic pins, which makes the overall construction a bit wobbly.
Secondly, the stand is at the wrong side of the bike I think. 

Maybe I'm being a bit too critical, because this set is only half the price and amount of elements of 8420, but still.

However, it's a nice addition to my collection and I'm happy with it. 
I would recommend this set to others, only don't get you expectations up too high.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Duq","2011-06-30T20:32:44.48Z","Pleasant surprise","<p>17 years after 8838 Lego released another dirt bike. I missed this set when it was in the shops so I recently picked it up on eBay. And I'm glad I did!<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>From the instructions it is clear that this set is aimed at young, beginning Technic builders; it takes 45 pages to put the 248 pieces together. In comparison back in 1991 there were 11 pages for the 251 pieces in 8838. The pages here are half the size but still, that's a big difference.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The instructions are easy to follow. Obviously in a fairly small set there are no elaborate mechanisms but the way the engine is put together is clever. In all I had a fun half hour putting the bike together.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some nice parts in this set. Those big wheels with nobby tires haven't been used much in recent years. It's also nice to see the old 40 tooth gear being used again. The mudguards are the same part as on 2005's street bike, a part that first appeared as a transparent canopy. There are three shocks, two for the front forks and a single one for the rear wheel. And of course it's got a chain and two cylinders and pistons.<br></p><p>The bulk of the parts though are studless beams and connectors in lime and grey.<br></p><h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed bike is bigger and looks much better than I had expected. The exhaust going through one of the panels is a nice touch, as are the minifig signal paddles for the brake and clutch lever and the round plate for the tank filler cap. <br></p><p>The only strange thing really is the boxer engine, like a BMW. That's an unusual engine type on a dirt bike.</p><p>Playable functions are like all Technic motorbikes; suspension, steering, working engine and a stand. Nothing new here, but it all works better than on some other models.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>So, as I said at the start, I'm glad I finally bought this set. A fun build that gives a good looking functional bike. Next time you see one on eBay just put in a bid. You won't regret it.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"Semantic","2008-03-10T23:02:14.937Z","Great, especially for its price","In my opinion this is best motocycle set for last 15 years. For its price it has great functionality: front &amp; rear suspension, two-cylinder engine, kick-stand and of-course steering :) It's good to have a big 40-tooth gear and chain - there are almost none in technic sets for last years.
Assembled it looks very good and works ideally. Front and rear wing are very useful.
Another good moment - it has two set of stickers so you can change model look if you want.
Weak points - pearl light grey tube instead of metallic silver and primary color of stickers does not completely coincide to lime green of parts. Also i personally don't appreciate blue long pins. I think it's wrong step in forthcoming color standartisation - so many blue dots in model are not good for its design.

Alternative model is good, but doesn't look so great like primary, misses rear suspension and unsteady.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vezon8764","2009-01-02T18:20:14.623Z","Rev' it up!","It's got more than 20 parts that i've never had before, and very few stickers!
Pros:
Construction is fast and easy
Looks cool
BIONICLE SIZE! That function I like the best, as I am a big fan of Bionicles
Cons:
Chain is a little loose
You can't really change it into your own creations.
I give it a 5 because it's my first Technic set, and I love it!
See you next review!

"Mandalorian","2010-11-11T08:35:07.663Z","Nice looks, some flaws.","Once you build this model, which doesn't take very long, you look at it and think: wow, this looks awesome! Then you start to examine it more carefully and think: in fact, this isn' THAT awesome. The chain is too loose, and when you take one of the parts off, it's too tight. The engine definately slows down the back wheel, but the suspension works great, and so does the kick-stand. After you rebuild it into the B-model, you realise the horrible truth - it looks sooo much like the dirt bike.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Suspension</li><li>Looks nice</li><li>Some good parts</li><li>Not bad playability</li><li>Cool build</li><li>Not that expensive</li><li>Bionicles (or Hero Factory villains) work well as riders<br></li></ul>Cons:<br><ul><li>Chain is either too loose or too tihgt&nbsp;</li><li>Engine slows down the back wheel</li></ul><br>That's about it. The pros definately outwheigh the cons, so why not buy it, if you don't have it already.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
