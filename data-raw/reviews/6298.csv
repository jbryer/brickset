"hurley_108","2007-12-26T23:44:24.513Z","A good way to get back into Lego!","I used to play with Lego all the time as a kid. From duplo through system, castle, a few themes I can't remember to the ultimate theme, technic. Then other things like high school and university came along and I put the Lego away. Ten plus years later, I asked for some Lego for Christmas and got this set. 

It's a good, simple re-introduction set, with rack and pinion steering, a two-cylinder imitation engine, pneumatic tires, and suspension. 

The one thing that strikes me, though, is the radically different direction Lego has gone in the years since I last bought a kit. Gone are the stackable strip pieces with pegs on top, cavities underneath, and holes through the sides. Now there are just smooth spars with holes through the sides. There are also a myriad of new L-brackets, spars with cross-slots to grab the sticks and 90-degree twists in the holes, and strange pieces with blade-like spans and interesting holes on each end. 

I may grow to like this new direction Lego has gone in. It certainly lends cleaner lines to the finished product. I can see the new ways of linking pieces together - by fixing them to each other with specialized pins rather than relying on features inherent in the pieces. I fear that this reduces the generalizations possible, but I also wonder if this perhaps simply requires a more advanced approach to construction, and ultimately makes technic a more sophisticated form of Lego than it once was. 

Ultimately, I'm willing to give Lego the benefit of the doubt and give this kit a 4/5 rating, more because I'd like to reserve 5/5 for truly exceptional kits rather than due to any failing sin this kit. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"turtlespit","2008-10-02T17:46:19.293Z","Great starter for Technic","I'm a recent AFOL, coming back to Lego after almost 15+ years.  When I was young, the technic sets never appealed to me.  They just didn't seem 'fun' enough.

However, after reading some reviews on Mindstorms NXT, and being thoroughly captivated by the though of buying a Mindstorms set, I though I would try the Dune Buggy as a taster for the 'studless' world of technic.

I picked up this set for &#163;9, which is better value per piece than the RRP.  I've built both the buggy and tractor models and they're both solid results that were fun to build.  

As one of the other reviews mentioned, only one of the wheels is connected to the engine... this feels like an omission, but I can see it was probably done to keep the set simpler, and therefore cheaper.  There is also the slightly longer wheel axel - once again another compromise.  Thankfully these aren't really noticeable when you're wheeling either model around your desk.

Overall, a 4 out of 5, and I'm looking forward to combining the pieces into some mindstorm creations once I psych up my credit card for the pain of an NXT kit.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoz","2009-01-02T15:23:13.34Z","Really cool","This set was very inexpensive and is fun to play with. You get 2 sets in 1, but you can only build 1 at a time. The results are worth it though, the dune  buggy has shock absorbers and you can run it over most things on the ground. The tractor has a motor that turns when you move the front wheels and is stearable from the top of the cab. There is also an attachment on the back that I think is a plow. This set is worth getting.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-05-23T15:33:32.497Z","The most fun Technic set I have!","This set is really fun, as you can race it against other cars! The suspension is fun, the engine is realistic, steering is great, and it has a sleek design!

Pros:

Great steering
Suspension
Engine
Realistic

Cons:

None!

Overall, a fun set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Mandalorian","2011-03-12T13:41:43.82Z","Really, really fun set.","<p>By looking at pictures of this set, you may think it's just another boring Technic set. How incredibly wrong you are. This is perhaps the most fun of those fourteen Technic sets I currently have. It's parts are good, lots of gears for a model this size, the build isn't very easy, but not too difficult either. It's just right and very enjoyable. Now to the playability. If I could, I would have rated this set ten bricks on playability. The steering uses the typical HOG system, but it also is connected to the steering wheel and can be steered via it. Also, the angle this little buggy turns at is incredible! Really sharp! It also has moving pistons in a V2 engine in the back and very, very bouncy suspension. Very bouncy. Also, this set doesn't cost a fortune, which is very important to most people. <br></p><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Cool pieces</li><li>Enjoyable build</li><li>Awesome steering</li><li>V2 engine</li><li>Nice colour scheme</li><li>Bouncy suspension</li><li>Affordable price</li><li>Steering connected to steering wheel</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>None that I can think of</li></ul><br>Now stop wasting your time in front of your computer and run to the shop and buy it. And to those of you who already have it, also stop wasting your time in front of your computer and go play with this awesome little thing.<br><br><h4>&nbsp; <br></h4>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-26T08:52:07.073Z","LEGO Technic - Dune Buggy Review","If you have a look in my LEGO Technic collection and if you skip the RoboRiders and the Slizer subthemes you'll notice that I don't have that many technic sets. This is one of my favourite LEGO Technic sets which I've got in my collection. The built of this vehicle can be a little bit tricky if you don't look at the instructions carefully. As in most LEGO Technic sets we get a feature which makes the steering-wheel and the tyres in the front moving at the same time. This feature can be done if you move the gear on the top to the left or to the right. The small seat does sviwel but it's too big for a LEGO minifig or a LEGO Technic minifig. If you turn the tyres on the back you'll see that the yellow pistons in the engine on the back are movable and you can also decide if you want to lift the tyres on the back up and down if you turn the gear.<br>This set also builds a second model but you can't build both of them at the same time. It's a fun set and great to play with. I also like the design of this vehicle.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Capitán_Skrall","2011-06-11T16:13:15.34Z","Fun starter set!","Hi there! This was my first&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;set. Even though there are lots of review for this one, here we go!&nbsp;<div><br><div><br></div><div>With 199 pieces, and at 20 US dollars (I paid 45 bucks. This set offers a nice value, with a reasonable sized box, if a little deep. The set contains a nice number of regular gears, a V2 piston motor, and some nice wheels. Nice inventory, doesn´t have many panels though.</div><div><br></div><div>So, about the build. A really nice one, quite&nbsp;intricate&nbsp;for the size. The steering has fun to put together. For both of the models (the buggy and the tractor). The secondary model as usual has some ingenious parts&nbsp;usage.</div></div><div><br></div><div>The finished models are both&nbsp;really&nbsp;sturdy and fun to play with. The buggy has front steering and suspension at the back. Also the V2,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is exposed. Overall has all the expected functions, only one wheel in connected to the motor. I think that is because there is no space for a differential, and that the wheels must spin on different axles (because of the steering). Also the steering wheel can steer the buggy, not just the HOG.</div><div><br></div><div>The tractor offers an even better building experience, it turns like a front loader. So kudos to the designers for using a different steering system. Also the V2 is present here, in this slightly smaller set, but a cutter one. Also has an arm thing (don´t know what it is) at the back. Its only poseable though.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div>-Really fun to play models</div><div>-Quite big model for the price.</div><div>-The functions are well executed.</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div>-It could have had front suspension, but its a small for that steering frame.</div><div>-Very skelletical look, I know its a Technic model, but it could have included some more panels.</div><div><br></div><div>A 4.5/5 from me! Hope this review was useful, I reccomend the set, if you have the chance to get it, do it!</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"Techman","2012-06-17T16:53:44.64Z","A good introductory set to technic","The reason I think this set is a good starter kit is primarily because it utilizes most of the real world aspects of a buggy. It has steering, an engine, suspension etc. The set is small, but it has been a great asset to me in constructing other technic builds. It helped me get to know what the cylinders are, pistons for example. I studied the rack and pinion. The shocks were a nice example and introduction for me. This set truly gave way to new opportunities to buy larger technic models with more features. This set, for its small size, packs a lot of real scenarios that can benefit others if interested. I knew I was intrigued, I got this for my birthday in 2008 of its release. I was stunned by it and immediately built it and gazed at its functions. The steering was new to me having never seen something like it before. I was curious and wanted to explore more about these techniques used to make that. The set is a useful resource and for pieces that I hadn't seen yet for its time. I own the newer version of the buggy which is 8048. The 8048 set is the larger version in red. This smaller version still keeps the same functions but more compact. The instructions also allow you to make a tractor out of it. I have made both and personally prefer the buggy. It looks great and serves as a good example of a real life vehicle. So, go buy one and see for yourself that it is a great tool to use to study and learn from.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,3,4,3,4
"N1ck3y","2012-01-18T12:18:40.58Z","Great","Me again most of the other guys have covered me on this great little set.
