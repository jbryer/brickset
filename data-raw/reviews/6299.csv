There were many innacurate details, none of the characters can jump, ONLY ONE of them can WALK THROUGH WATER, if you die as a certain character you lose him/her until you find another of his/her mask i bored with it quickly and hated the music. I disliked it soooooo much that i am actually thinking of selling it on Ebay. Don't buy this. it has some (with great emphasis on SOME)cool features but its not that great for $30. And if your a Hard-core Bionicle fan then you would probably, like me, be dissapointed by the games innacuracy. Again Don't Get It!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
