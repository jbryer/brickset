"SlyRaskal","2007-10-15T15:38:44.077Z","Great addition, but wish it was a limited production","<p>I managed to pick one of these up this past weekend at a local Toys R Us store after I found that they began selling at LEGO Retail and Toys R Us locations.<br />
<br />
Overall I&#39;m very happy with it&#39;s construction, detail, and look. My only quarrel with this is that it is not limited run and numbered like the other LEGO Gentle Giant Maquettes that were made of Darth Vader, Stormtrooper, Blackhole Stormtrooper and soon to be released, the Boba Fett maquette. 3 of those were released exclusively by the Star wars shop, the other was sold exclusively in Japan at a Blister event. At least the Luke Skywalker maquette does come with a certificate of authenticity, but making them numbered and limited production would have driven up it&#39;s appeal and exclusivity since it is a collectible and NOT a toy.<br />
<br />
I give it a 4 only because it&#39;s not a limited run like the other 4 maquettes released by LEGO and Gentle Giant.</p>

"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T10:33:45.043Z","Not as big as I thought","When I purchased this set at my toys r us store, I bought it for $20. I thought it would be at least 8 inches tall. Turns out to be just below 6 inches. It is probably worth $20 but definetly not worth $70 (Sorry for all the people who got ripped-off of their money) Also as Sly Raskal said, it is not limited addition.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"michaelvader","2010-01-10T07:54:34.28Z","one awesome gift....","why dose everyone hate this guy??? This set has 4 parts: head, body legs and arms, lego star wars sign, and the blue lightsaber.

pros:
head has lots of detail
you can move the head 360
awesome bendy arms but to big to put on minifigs
evrything is awesome

cons:
my mom and dad gave this to me and spent $70 on it.
I feel sorry for them.

"legocolecter_abu__h919","2008-10-24T15:50:12.153Z","This set seems better in the box!","This set isn't really as big as they saw it is. 
Pros
great for lego star wars fans
has a great look
Cons
The set is small
It breaks easily
The pieces are mostly magnets not legos
That's my pros and cons for this set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
