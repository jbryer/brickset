"brickbuilder711","2007-11-25T11:19:16.543Z","Neat Little Set","First and foremost, I'd like to say that 2008 sets are keeping LEGO on the right track. Picked this and 7741 at TRU in Miami, FL on Black Friday.

The build is nice. The model gets very firm and I did have gun adding the forks. Even the lights are represented by the circular 1x1's in TrRed and TrOrange.

Only flaw: the fork does not completely go downward without enough effort.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"skyscraper","2007-12-25T17:52:07.39Z","Very good just a few things ","THe set is very stable and lift's objects quite nicely . And it looks good to but it is a little bit expensive. I like the set alot, it cost normaly 9-8 US dollars. I'm surprized that this was updated recently i got it awhile ago. I think that the fork lift should have come with some more stuff for it like traffic cone and stuff to lift . ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-22T17:46:24.7Z","Little Forklift","This is a really nice but small Technic set. It has a forklift and a crate to put objects on. The forklift does lift the crate up which is a plus. This isn't bad at all and good for Technic fans. 5 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"pirakapro","2008-02-25T22:39:17.687Z","very poor","This set is not good and has an elastic (i do not like that) the elastic wears out and the fork thing wont go up all the way and it is worth looks like it is worth five dollers not the eight dollers it is now.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Xwing250","2008-12-02T12:13:20.31Z","Good for &#163;5!","I do like this set. Due to the price, the set is great value. Some Nice features to it and the practically of it is good. I use it to hold my pens at my desk. The lift-load function works very well and has some nice pieces. The second model (the buggy) is not as good. It doesn`t look convincing either. If you want a good buggy get the blue dune buggy at 13.99. I changed the forklift into a mini telehandler which is a good model. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2009-06-11T04:41:45.653Z","Really Cute","I hadn't touched a Technics set for a LONG time, so I thought I'd get this small set to have a feel of it again. I bought it because it was cheap, and I didn't think it might impress me so much, but after building it I was really impressed! The forklift is really cute and uses a rubber piece to move the forks. It also has a 6x4 cargo pallet in which you could put on minifigs or whatever you like and have fun with it.

The building process takes almost no time at all! But you could always disassemble the forklift and build into the other separate model, a race car.

"FlagsNZ","2014-08-10T08:21:24.313Z","Great small fork-lift","<p>I had given this set up as lost, but today I found it underneath some old picture frames after I cleaned out the cupboard under the stairs.</p>

<p>This set was a gift from my son several years ago.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It comes in a little box with two little instruction booklets. The first book is to build a mini-forklift while the second book is for the mini-dragster.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For such a small set, it does have a good range of parts albeit with a few instances of each.</p>

<p>The blue rubber band is the star part as it gives the fork lift its lift function and also provides some springy suspension for the dragster.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is an easy build. It is easy to zip around with either model once completed.</p>

<p>The fork lift is provided with a pallet made of 1x4 technic bricks and two 2x6 plates. I wish more technic sets had pallets or containers so that they could function in such a complete way.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The completed model</span></h3>

<p>I like the fact that such a small set with so few pieces makes two very different but functional models.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">I have been practicing my fork lift driving on my&nbsp;coffee&nbsp;table.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a nice little set and great value for money. I was rapt to get this as a gift and now really pleased to have rediscovered it again.</p>
