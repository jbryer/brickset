"ronbonne","2008-01-11T14:06:24.403Z","Must Have","This set falls into the same category as Cafe Corner and Market Street when it comes to innovative and creative use of parts and colors. It has an enormous amount of different parts (the parts inventory in the manual is 4 pages long!) and nice colors. The build is also very exciting; no repetitive steps. The cars are great and there are some very nice touches (like the golden bricks in the fountain). The set has 8 minifigs.
I am sure this set will go down in history as another classic. A must have for the true Lego collector.
The one and only disappointing thing about this set is the use of stickers. Some of the stickers (like the letters &quot;CINEMA&quot;) are stuck on the sides of multiple assembled bricks. This makes re-using those parts to build something else very difficult. Lego should really stop doing this i.m.h.o.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"bmwlego","2008-03-31T19:56:12.67Z","Wonderful Set to Commemorate 50th Anniversary of the LEGO Brick!","My wife bought this set for me for Valentine's Day '08. This set was worth every penny! Based on the 100 pieces per 10 US dollars ratio, this set could have easily cost much closer to 200 dollars because it has 1,981 pieces! The Town Plan set is one for the ages and I am sure that LEGO fans will truly enjoy building this set.

There are 3 buildings, 2 vehicles and a fountain to build and 8 minifigs to populate the town. This set almost feels like 3-5 medium sized sets in 1 gigantic set.

The Octan Service Station was the 1st building I tackled. I was pumped to get the classic clear garage door system that I had in my childhood sets from the 80's such as the Police Headquarters and Fire Department. This building also comes with a car wash, 2 old style gas pumps, a skylight, and many more details such as a workbench, cash register, tire rack, and a great SNOT technique built sign. 

The 2nd set I built was the Town Hall and this used offset jumper plates to set the windows back in the building. The front of the building has columns (again accomplished using the SNOT technique). There is a counter and 2 plants on the inside of the building and a clock and town map on the outside of the hall. Thankfully the color used here is dark green and boy are there a lot of dark green bricks, 133 of them to be exact.

The fountain is a cute detail that also has 2 park benches and 3 gold bricks accompanying it. I don't really see what the big deal is about the gold bricks, the gold color seems spray painted on and the quality doesn't seem like the LEGO quality we are all accustomed to getting.

The final building I completed was the movie theater and this set taught me that you don't need a lot of 1x4 bricks to build. This theater uses a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 1x3 bricks to construct most of the outer walls. This theater uses a bunch of harder to find colors like dark red, tan and medium blue. The movie posters are a great detail as is the popcorn stand, ticket stand, and small theater with 7 seats and a movie screen. Obviously this is a movie theater in the heart of a small town's downtown area, not a megaplex in a sprawling suburb. The marquis in front of the theater is simply stunning and another example of using the SNOT (studs not on top) technique. The angled look of the marquis is accomplished by using hinged plates and this technique is truly impressive. The long sign up the front of the building that says &quot;CINEMA&quot; is another great use of the SNOT technique and I passed a movie theater in Queens, NY that had a similar sign in the front, almost as if the designer tried emulating this particular movie theater.

The 2 cars are great mini sets as well. The blue sedan has fins in the back like a classic car from the 1950's. It is a simple build (when compared to the oil tanker in this set) and looks great. The oil tanker is awesome and does a great job of looking both like the  oil tanker included in the 1958 set and a LEGO toy that uses modern bricks to create the curved look of the vehicle's roof and front end.

This set is 1 that I would not want to miss and am glad that I have it in my collection. Now if it were only cheaper so I could add more of these bricks to my collection! The letter by Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen is a nice touch, too bad it came crumpled up in the box. This letter is the 1st pages of the instruction booklet and my booklets came folded/rolled up in the box. Why can't LEGO package instruction booklets so that they don't come messed up? Put them in a cheap folder to protect them or something similar. The only other downside to this set is the use of stickers but they really add to the realistic, detailed look of the set.

This set is a resounding 5 in my opinion and I would highly recommend it to my fellow Bricksetters.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"jgptee","2008-07-07T05:07:39.937Z","not just one you need.","i like historical buildings and this set is almost perfect for me. why i say, almost? 

i think most collectors are of the opinion that this set (which comprises of 3 1950's buildings, plenty of mini-figures, 2 vehicles and a fountain) is a must-get addition to any town building exercise that complements with all the market street modular buildings (cafe corner, green grocer and market street) released so far. i am not in total agreement with this because the town plan buildings, especially the dark green town hall, is too small when compared with the modular buildings if placed close together in a town setting. in addition, the town plan buildings are all not modular in structure and the back walls are missing.

the best building of the set has to be the iconic cinema, because it is of an architectural design that is true to that era, and it is huge enough to sit nicely next to the green grocer or the cafe corner sets without being intimidated. the only drawback is that the back of it is open like any city lego buildings. i don't quite like that. furthermore, the screening area looks very small.

the service station is the only consolation and the other great building of the set. it is second best because it does not have a distinctive architecture like that of the cinema. it seems to have 4 walls because its service features surround the building and has to be placed on its own, separated from the modular buildings by road plates. it comes with a car wash, a mini-mart, a repair shop, and a separate fill-up area.

the dark green town hall is probably the odd one in the whole set. my impression of a town hall is some grand building in the middle of a town, but this one is just too small, and looks like its back-half has been cut off, that makes you wonder where the rest of it is! it looks more like an elaborate leisure pavilion that you normally find in the middle of a green park with its many windows than a proper town hall. even the cinema is bigger than the town hall. and there is nothing much you can do inside!

with all these imperfections, is this a must-buy? the answer is still, a big yes. in fact, i would encourage lego city builders to get not just one, but two town plan sets! by connecting the same buildings back to back and with a little modification here and there, you have complete 4-walled 1950s buildings that look bigger, spacious and more appealing; and they sit perfectly with all the other modular buildings you have amassed so far.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"HQuiff","2009-06-01T06:00:59.14Z","The Greatest Set Ever Made!","What a way to celebrate the 50 Years of the Lego Brick. This is by far the best set created in Lego. With a fantastic 50s feel made by the great architecture. The Cinema is the highlight for me. It combines a Light Blue, dark Red, Light and Dark Gray, plus tan pieces, which in any ordinary set would be horrible, though somehow it is designed so well that it fits perfectly.

Right, now lets start a more compact way at looking at it!

Build: 10/10! Perfect! The Build is enjoyable and fun. It takes up the best part of a full day, but it's well worth it. Also it doesn't include Technic pieces making it more enjoyable. Overall the build is one of the best parts about it. 

Architecture: 10/10! I don't who studied it, but WOW is all I can say. The Cinema inherits this the most, as it really shows off the great detail.

Playability: 9/10! As yet I haven't played with it that much, because I've been filming scenes more (By use of Stop-Motion). But the parts I have played with are just as good as anything else!

Cinema: 10/10! The best of the bunch. Probably the best building of all time. With a lift-off roof, a food counter, flashing lights, movie posters, ticket thing, a screening room complete with five chairs, a screen, and a projectile camara, it makes this also the most detailed building in Lego History. I honestly can't find a single con about it. It's just special.

Town Hall: 9.9/10! Like the Cinema, this features a great look at architecture too. It's inside room isn't that big, but again it has a lift-off roof. As well as that it has two HUGE plants inside, and has a lovely white carpet outside. And if that's not enough, it has a MASSIVE rose bed. It's brilliant! The second best thing about this set.

Cars & Other: 8.99999/10! The Fountain is lovely, it has of course the Three Golden Bricks, and a new water piece. As well as two (Yes, Two) benches. Then there's the Octan Truck. The Octan Truck has quite a long build. But unlike the might think, this is a LOT better then meats the eye. Then there's also the blue car which is also nice, nothing more to be said there. Finally the have the Octan Fuel giver thingy (Don't ask me what it's called!) which is also nice, plus realistic.

Garage: 9/10! The Octan Garage is a mix of the old and the new. It features the older look and color scheme, but also has new things, i.e the Car Wash, Service Station, and counter, ETC. I'll try to rap this up now so I can get on to the overall. Anyways, it can fold it's self back in fourth and is a great edition, though isn't as good as the other two buildings.

Overall: 100,000,000,000/10! Best set ever! I don't care what it costs just get it! It's fabulous and everyone should have one. Plus in the instructions you get a letter from the new owner of Lego, who is actually the creator of Lego's Grandson.

Hope you enjoyed my review!

"lotographia","2009-05-31T20:18:12.763Z","A reluctant criticism.","Okay, I really REALLY want to give this set five stars. It's detailed, gorgeous, great value for money, well designed and uses a lot of interesting building techniques.

But it contains my biggest pet hate, stickers going over more than one brick. I don't mind stickers on their own, anyone who doesn't like them doesn't need to use them if they don't want to and I really like how they 'complete' a set, making it more than the sum of its parts.

But stickers going across more than one brick defeats one of the important features of Lego, which is to be able to entirely deconstruct a set and build it again from scratch, or use the pieces for other designs. I once tried cutting up stickers so I could take the bricks apart, but the result was awful.

The first time this set used stickers over more than one brick, I was willing to overlook it because of the positive qualities of the set. The second time, I was also feeling generous.

But when I was building the cinema and huge portions of the building can't be taken apart without damaging the stickers... I lost patience. I realise the detail of the set would be hard to achieve without having stickers over multiple bricks, but I would prefer a slight compromise in artistic vision to not being able to take the set apart completely.

I feel sorry giving this set that otherwise receives almost unanimously five stars a four star rating, but this valid criticism shouldn't be entirely ignored.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I also took the guy sitting on the bench reading the magazine and made him the mayors youngest son. The guy who is pushing the cart with the wheel is the mayors oldest son. The gas station is perfect for town travelers. I also love the garage. Last but not least, the Cinema. That is just pure awesomeness! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"icncu222","2009-08-25T01:17:11.047Z","Creating that ""Old Town"" Feel","I ended up buying this set brand new from ebay a few months back on the suggestion from my wife. I was skeptical at first until I saw that this town plan actually had minifigs and minifig scale buildings. When it finally arrived I was amazed at the detail on the box and the fact that the company president was on it with a older picture in the right-hand corner showing him playing with a girl his age back in the 50's.

Opening the box revealed several bags with numbers so that the builder wouldn't be overwhelmed by the 1900+ parts that build four different subsets. These subsets include a Cinema, Gas Station, City Hall, and Park Green with Cars and Gas Pumps. The buildings all incorporated very nice rare colors that tend to appeal to that 50's atmosphere.

My favorite building out of them all is the gas station which features the classic town garage door and the incorporation of a curved trans-clear front window (used in breezway cafe set). in addtion, the gas station also has a counter to where a citizen can purchase fruit or bread. The gas station is further littered with the typical aides such as barrels with pumps, a tool carrage and a tire carrage.

The cinema is also spectacular, with excellent details throughout like a gumball machine, ticket booth, snack counter with popcorn and a great movie room! Plus, the cinema incorporates some rare light blue and maroon colors and a SNOT (studs not on top) technique on the floor.

A city hall is included which also uses some rare dark green bricks and a nice stair setup so that the newly married couple can go down. This was the least favorite of the buildings for me but it is still very nice. I tend to think of the movie Back to the Future when looking at the completed setup.

I have since made this the ""old town"" in my setup and numerous time has been the backdrop for an ""alien invasion movie"" using my Alien Moon Stalker to wreak havoc for my Drive - In Movie Theater creation.

Considering the expensive price, this set is a must have and considering that technically this set contains four individual sets the cost is not that bad per unit...plus I don't need to mention that you will get three cool gold bricks.

In summary, any true lego collector must celebrate a set like this as an historical significance and for the fun of lego! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"legofan3810","2010-03-22T19:30:37.67Z","The greatest set ever","First of all, let me tell you this is a very long review, but will be detailed in every little way. Second of all, this is the best set ever! Get this set if you can! This is the ultimate LEGO set for the ultimate LEGO Collection!<br><h4>The Cinema</h4><br>The Cinema is my favorite part of the set and is my favorite build of the set. This set comes with a board showing what movie it is showing, how much the tickets cost and when it is chowing. It even comes with two red ropes (not real ones). Next to the boards and on the boards are a nice assortment of lights. The tallest part of the building is the sign that says cinema, and the letters are spelled in stickers The windows of the building are covered in several different movie posters. The outside is covered in tiles, and has a ticket booth with a cash register (actually a brick with a printed sticker).<br><br>Now for the inside. The inside has a popcorn stand with another cash register, soda dispensers, and a storage with yellow studs (signifying popcorn). It also has a gumball machine. On two parts of the ceiling, there are lights. There is a door leading to the movie watching area. This area has 5 seats so five figures can watch. There is also a screen with a sticker signifying the movie. There is also a movie playing thing (reel, or something). <br><br><h4>The Garage/Convenience Store/Car Wash</h4><br>The build for this building was good. On the outside there are garage doors that you can lift up, a door to the convenience store, A wide window (like the curvy ones) some weird accessories, A tree, a sign that have the Lego gas brand, signs on the roof that say car wash and service station.<br><br>On the inside of the garage are tools, such as hammers, wrenches, and screwdrivers. On the inside of the convenience store, is a stand with a cash register, a banana, a croissant bread, an apple and these weird tube pieces connected to some studs (maybe soda). On the inside of the garage is not much, it only has those weird turning squeaky things that roll every time you leave a car wash (very realistic!).<br><br><h4>The Town Hall</h4><br>The town hall build was also good. On the outside there are tiles, stairs, flowers, windows, columns, a clock, a map of ''Lego Town'' a door a lamppost, and the roof. On the inside their is a table, with some flowers on the side. Not too detailed for the town hall but ok.<br><br><h4>The Cars.</h4><br>I like the blue car because it looks a lot like a 50's car. The red truck is also cool and has a hose on the back (i don't know for what).<br><br><h4>The Pumps, Figures and Fountain</h4><br>The pumps were very realistic as they have actual pumps, and sines that said the name of the gas company. The figures include, two garage people, two newlyweds, two cinema workers, and two regular people. The fountain was nice because it had a water brick, benches and 3 gold bricks!<br><br>This is a great set and I suggest you buy one of these!<br><br><br>Overall, 5/5&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"SgtSmash","2010-10-27T17:03:51.41Z","An instant classic!","<p>There's nothing I can&nbsp;say here that hasn't already been said by others about this set&nbsp;in their reviews, so perhaps I can just describe a bit of the fun I had putting together each building. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gas station by far is my favorite, and offers the most play value. The detail that went into this set&nbsp;truly makes it appear like it is&nbsp;from the 1950's. You have your snack shop, old fashioned gas pumps, garage with&nbsp;skylight, a really cool&nbsp;old sign out front, as well a vintage gas truck.&nbsp;The garage is big enough for smaller vehicles, but todays' standard style vehicles which tend to be on the larger, wider side will never fit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cinema is&nbsp;a masterpiece&nbsp;in its own right.&nbsp;I would have loved to have had this when I collected Legos almost 30 years ago. The signage out front, as well as the movie posters on the outside of the building are incredible. The snack stand is wonderfully detailed, and the theater itself has plenty of room for minifigs. One&nbsp;feature I appreciate most is the ground tiling out front will allow you to&nbsp;easily include&nbsp;amongst your modular buildings for a seamless sidewalk and style. This set truly belongs amongst the modulars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that, I wish I had more good things to say about the town hall building. It has a magnificent&nbsp;outer facade and has a real presence in your town, but the&nbsp;interior leaves something to be desired.&nbsp;You could perhaps mod the interior to something more appealing, and you almost need to display it from the front at all times, as the open-ended back is not very flattering.&nbsp;I bought an extra green baseplate and put the fountain in the middle with this building attached. This really makes the building a meeting place of sorts for townfolk. </p>
<p><br/>The 50's style car that comes with the town is another nice touch but with such low headroom, only certain minifigs will fit in there. Since I have road plates connected to all the buildings in my town, it is difficult to achieve the look of the Town Plan that the picture shows, which is a quaint little setting.&nbsp;I basically have the buildings across the street from each other or very nearby so they do not lose the ""Town Plan"" purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one complaint I have about the entire set is the STICKERS. Holy cow, are there stickers.&nbsp;But, this is just part of the building process.&nbsp;There always were some stickers with Lego's, going back to the 80's, but&nbsp;Lego also used to include&nbsp;more pre-printed bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this set is no longer available in stores, and the sellers on Amazon are blood-thirsty vampires, you may get lucky to get this set at a reasonable price (or perhaps the buildings individually) on Ebay.&nbsp;At any rate, if you are thinking about getting this set,&nbsp;you really can't go wrong. Aside from maybe the 1980 Main Street set, there is/has been&nbsp;no other set that gives you an instant start or boost to a town than this.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"legokoala","2010-07-27T14:41:27.01Z","The Best :)","<p>Let me start off by saying, if you are going to by this, wait no longer. Buy this! It is a nice set, completing my city. If you still aren't sure, read on but don't say that I didn't warn you that its long. Now that I think of it, I didn't warn you. Well, its long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Cinema</h4>
<p>I loved this part, too bad it broke in my closet when I had to clean my room... anyways, it is the perfect little movie theater. I like the big sign. Its unique. Inside, there are two rooms. One is your snack stand, with a worker included. The other room is your movie showing room. An old movie is showing. There are 5 or so seats there and high up on the wall in the back, is a little movie projecter. Neat!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Town Hall</h4>
<p>I do think it is more of a church than a town hall but its really around the same thing. You can use it either way. The building design is too cool. I like everything about this set. The town hall has a little podium for the guy who works there to stand and greet people. In front of the town hall is a little map. Isn't that handy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Car Station Place</h4>
<p>My favorite part, personally, is the car wash. I am not sure all cars fit in it but its still cool. There is 2 gas pumps to the side of the building. Your lego minifigures can just drive on over and get some gas or get their car fixed. It has a store inside. The car station place is a really nice touch on this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Rest</h4>
<p>The small golden brick fountain is cool. Minifigures can just sit and read the paper in peace before or after work. The minifigures themselves are cool. There is a newly wedded couple, 2 workers at the cinema, numberous workers at the car station, a guy at the town hall who I think is supposed to be the mayor, and a guy reading the newspaper at the fountain. Did I miss a guy? I don't know. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Overall veiw</h4>
<p>The overall veiw for this set is...its worth your money so buy it. Lego did an amazing job making this masterpiece. I am glad I saved up 150 dollars for it. Its easy to play with. The buildings are cool and the minifigures are nice. Its worth the many hours of putting it together.</p>

<p>Lego, you did a great job! :)</p>

I think the large ""pillar pieces"" (yep, each of the pillars is made from only to pieces) are relatively rare, too, although I would have preferred lots of those small, circular prism pieces (sorry, I don't know their names). Nice printed (I think) clock piece, too.</div></div><div><br></div><div><h4 style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 1.1em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; "">The Service station:</h4><div><br></div><div>My favourite building in the set! It has a little shop, a unique curved design, a place to repair cars and even a car wash, but that's not my favourite part of this building. It's actually on two plates rather than one, which are attached together like a hinge: therefore, you can alter the service station's layout. Apart from changing the service station's look, it has an application in play: you can only get to certain parts in certain layouts. At first, this might sound like a bad thing, but in fact it prevents the need for an open roof, which I think is a good thing.</div></div><div><br></div><div>The service station also comes with a little traffic island with petrol (gas to those of you in America) pumps. You can ""fill up your cars"" with the nozzle, which moves, and the lights near the pumps look really good. I've recently expanded this so that it's larger and has a phone booth and railings, but it's fine on its own.</div><div><br></div><div><div><h4 style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 1.1em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; "">The Fountain:</h4><div><br></div><div>A nice little extra here, especially with the exclusive ""golden"" (gold coloured rather than pearl gold) bricks and benches.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><h4 style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 1.1em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; "">The Vehicles:</h4><div><br></div><div>The set includes a really nice looking 1950's car, and a truck, with petrol/gas for the service station.

"av8r1973","2011-01-08T04:37:37.887Z","Superb! Stupendous! Excellent!  Well done, LEGO!","<p>We have been building up our city with the relatively new sets and began to collect the modular buildings. &nbsp;We saw this online here in Taiwan cheaper than the beasts on Amazon carry it for, so we picked it up.</p><p><br>The box arrived factory-sealed in shiny plastic and in excellent shape. &nbsp;I began to feel guilty for wanting to crack it open and build it. &nbsp;I considered buying a second set for building, but the prices had already jumped, so we cracked it open.</p><p><br></p><p>Three separate buildings and some ""accessories"" complete the Town Plan. &nbsp;A service station, town hall and cinema are the main structures, while a fountain, car and gas truck finish the set.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the build, I ran across elements I used as a kid in the 70's, some that are present on the newer City sets, and some that I haven't ever seen before. &nbsp;Not just one or two, but several! There are some really ingenious build sequences that left me wondering just what it is they feed the LEGO engineers so they can come up with this stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>I'll try to list my pros and cons below, but it's mostly going to be pros.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>1. Hinged service station allows for play in the service bay as well as the car wash.</li><li>2. Car wash is awesome (except for convertibles)</li><li>3. Service station sign is incredibly complex and well thought out.</li><li>4. Fuel island is very realistic and was a lot of fun to build</li><li>5. Little blue car had a LOT of parts!</li><li>6. Service station tree is cool.</li><li>7. Cinema sign was cool to build and looks great!</li><li>8. Popcorn stand? &nbsp;How cool!</li><li>9. Theater seats are cool, projector was ingenious</li><li>10. Cinema marquee was fun to build and well thought out</li><li>11. Vertical area behind marquee is really complex</li><li>12. Town hall flower garden is cool!</li><li>13. Stair case was new to me - fun to build.</li><li>14. Hadn't seen the trees inside the town hall before</li><li>15. Mini figs are ALL great! From the bride and groom to the fuel truck driver. &nbsp;All of them are great.</li><li>16. Fountain really adds detail to my city!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>1. Most of the glass panels for the cinema had some kind of sticky oil on them that made them all stick together. &nbsp;Good thing the movie premier poster stickers covered them up.</li><li>2. Service station sign stickers cover up really intricate build. &nbsp;It's a shame.</li><li>3. Kit was missing 5 white 1x1 flat tiles. &nbsp;Fortunately, I had spares.</li><li>4. Price! &nbsp;I wish I had picked this up when it was for sale. &nbsp;Bummer.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>All in all, this is an excellent set! &nbsp;It really goes great with the modulars and even fits with the newer City sets (my City truck is delivering packages in front of town hall). &nbsp;Plan to add it to your City, but make sure you have sufficient real estate available. This really makes a big addition!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"RichieBitchy","2021-01-11T18:44:08.01Z","One of the Best of All Time","<p>I remember seeing this set in the catalog&nbsp;when I was&nbsp;about 6 or 7 and immediately wanted it. I had some smaller sets, so I imagined someone spending 150USD on a Lego set was ridiculous. But my mother surprised me with it and it&#39;s what started my collection of Lego City and town-themed sets.</p>

<p>This was a commemorative set for the 50-year anniversary of the Lego Brick, and the eponymous set released in 1958. You definitely feel the 1950s and 1960s in this set, with the architecture, design, and vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It features a cinema, with marquee, popcorn stand, candy dispenser, and theatre with two rows of seat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The service station has a garage, a car wash, and a convenience store. It also features two gas pumps on a separate baseplate.</p>

<p>The church has a gorgeous exterior, but not much inside; just the altar, the chairs, some frond leaves. The leaves made for play inside a bit difficult.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fountain is really the major focal point of the set, especially with the three golden bricks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The blue car has retro written all over it, as well as the oil truck.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great value of a set, with some unique features and styles that a diehard Lego collector or City fan must get their hands on.</p>
