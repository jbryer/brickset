"omgbrick","2007-12-28T20:29:57.28Z","Goblin Swords","This is part of the 2008 Exo-Force Jungle line it costs about 27 Dollars Canadian. There is almost 300 pieces in here most are used in the giant fans. There is 1 minifig in this set which is a brown devastator robot that we've seen in the past.
The bags are numbered 1 and 2, 1 builds the minibot and the minifig. The minibot resembles a large bee since it has a yellow and black colour scheme with a stinger. There are a few new pieces in it first there is a large black and yellow spike; the base of it is black while the end is a bendy yellow rubber. A new grille piece is also included it’s a one by two grill on a slope similar to a 1 by 1 slope. Along with this there are some yellow Viking horns.
Bags labeled 2 build the Storm Lasher. First you have to make the cockpit holding the window in place is a new 2 by 1 double clip, the chain guns are held in place via some Bionicle pieces. There is also two 1 by 4 plates that have some small hollow pipes coming out of them. For playability purposes there is a handle on it similar to the Sonic Phantom except it isn't attached to a gun. There is another one of those grill pieces on the ship the little minibot is connected to the Storm Lasher by a little clip on top of the Storm Lasher. The rotors are identical to each other; they are made mostly from hinge pieces connected to each other to form a circle. The rotors can rotate in almost any direction thanks to some Exo-Force hinge pieces. There is a grand total of 12 goblin swords used for the propeller blades so that’s very useful.
Overall besides the propellers and cockpit this set seems rather empty as there is almost nothing on the bottom portion of the ship though this is an under 30 dollar set so I can't dock much from it. Other than that this is a good value for your money because of the many new parts and a lot of click hinges. 4.5/5

"Shadow_Crawler","2008-06-12T22:18:20.763Z","Magnificent!","A magnificent set. Let's see:
Box = 5/5
Nice CGI picture, with a mini-bot and Id on the front, and the combi with Dark Panther at the back.

Building = 5/5
It took me 75 minutes to build this set (well, I'm a slow builder). Building the SL is fun, but watch out, because most of them is small parts. Be careful and always remember to build on a flat floor.

Playability = 5/5
Very nice! With two real-spinning rotor blades (this can work as a mini fan in case if the electricity in your house went off :D)The pincers can really be snapped too, I tried snapping Hayato in it. The mini-bot is huge! about 2-3 times bigger if compared with River Dragon's mini-bot.

Overall = 5/5
This set is magnificent! With two real-spinning rotor blades, amazing! The pincers, cannons, and rocket pods looks really cool too. This is a must-buy, even if you're not an exo lover, buy one and try for yourself!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Inferno_Ratchet","2008-11-10T02:19:22.983Z","hmm it would be good on my nic-nac shelf....","I dont have a nic-nac shelf and why would I put this awesome set on a shelf anyway? the scimitar(i hope i spelt that right)blades are very good and do make for nice wings but i do agree that the extra space should be used for a floor panel to carry in extra troops(seeing that the robots have only 3 mechs)

pros:
very cool wings
good guns(revolving machine guns awesome)
awesome pincers

cons:
extra space
flimsy minibot wings
one iron drone...&gt;:&lt;...-_-

over all though 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2009-08-10T12:26:58.327Z","Awsome design","The design of the Storm Lasher is so awsome. It comes with one iron
robot minifigure. This set even includes a mini mech which looks like a
mosquito to me. The wings can be folded in lots of directions. Also the
blades are cool. If you're looking for a Star Wars speeder then you
should get this model. You can also take the robots from the Exo-Force
for new Battle Droids. It also includes stickers and an Exo-code. The
blasters on the sides by the cockpit are also nice designed.<br><br><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8117-1.jpg[/img]</span><br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Positive:</span><br><br><ul><li>Design</li></ul><ul><li>Wings can be folded in lots of directions</li></ul><ul><li>Good model for Star Wars stories</li></ul><ul><li>Exo-Force robot minifigures can be taken for Star Wars Battle Droids</li></ul><ul><li>Blasters</li></ul><ul><li>Minirobot</li></ul><ul><li>Exo-Code</li></ul><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Negative:</span><br><br><ul><li>Stickers (but they're still fun to put on.)</li></ul><br>All
