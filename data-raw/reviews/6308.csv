"SJPlego","2007-12-29T23:42:19.343Z","The Final Game of the LEGO Star Wars Trilogy","“LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga, a game for next-gen consoles and the Nintendo DS.”

Above is the usual advert for the new LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga game, describing it “for next-gen consoles and the Nintendo DS.”  Not the computer or any old-gen consoles, except Nintendo DS.  Why?  Unlike the PC or the PS2, the DS version of LEGO Star Wars needed a serious redo.

And this is the redo.

PACKAGING
Despite not having a Wii or the Wii version of this game, I have an empty (albeit damaged) box of the Wii version, so I can compare the packaging of the DS versus the Wii.
The front of the DS version’s packaging is mostly the same as the Wii version’s packaging, a bit more compact, though, and with the words “NINTENDO DS” on the side.
The back, however, is much different.  Whereas the Wii’s box shows prequel trilogy characters fighting alongside original trilogy characters in the Battle of Hoth, along with three screenshots, all this has would be three screenshots.  These three screenshots are of freeplay in the level Negotiations, and the two mini-games Deflection and Pit Stop.  Not exciting like the Battle of Hoth image, but still informative and trying to tell the customer what he or she is buying.

CANTINA
Most of the game takes place in the good ol’ Mos Eisley Cantina.  Within the Cantina, you can:
 - Access multiplayer
 - Access episodes and levels
 - Access mini-games
 - Purchase characters
 - Purchase extras
 - Purchase hints
 - Create custom characters
 - View Minikit models
 - Start small-scale bar fights.
That’s right.  Unfortunately, unlike its predecessor LEGO Star Wars II for DS, this version lacks the ability to create full-scale bar fights in the Cantina.  Why?  Because there’s only two CPU characters wandering around a room in the Cantina at a time, players are unable to create full-scale bar fights.

GAMEPLAY
Playing as your favorite LEGO Star Wars characters in LEGO Minifig form, you are able to “Kick some brick in I through VI,” as the back of the package says.  This combines the levels of LEGO Star Wars and its sequel into one game for the DS.  For the first time, DS-owners are able to play prequel levels on their DS.  With thirty different levels, the gameplay is challenging, puzzling, funny, and of course, fun.  From here we get into specifics:

STORY MODE AND FREEPLAY

For every non-vehicle level, there are two modes: Story Mode and Freeplay.  In the case of vehicle levels, there is only Story Mode.  In Story Mode, you must play the level as specific characters with limited skills and capabilities.  In Freeplay, you are able play as any eight characters you’ve unlocked and purchased.  You get to select one character that you want to play as, and then the DS picks seven other characters.  During freeplay, you can use these new characters and their skills to access areas where you couldn’t before.

CUTSCENES
In Story Mode, occasionally you’ll see a cutscene, which will tell the story.  These cutscenes are based off of the cutscenes of the other versions, but done in a style that make them seem like someone took a bunch of screenshots of the cutscenes, then used the screenshots to create a Flash animation.  These cutscenes attempt to capture the humor of the other versions.  Sometimes this is done quite well.  Other times, not so well.

MINIKITS AND RED POWER BRICKS
Minikits, or sometimes called LEGO Canisters, are white spinning canisters with a red and green light on one side.  There are ten of these hidden in each level.  When all ten in a level are collected, a MINI Star Wars vehicle can be seen in the Cantina.  When all fifty in an episode are collected, a bonus MINI Star Wars vehicle can be seen in the Cantina.  When all three hundred in the game are collected, the MINI Rebel Blockade Runner can be seen in the Cantina.
Extras and Mini-games aren’t just handed to you for free.  First, you must find a Red Power Brick within a level.  There is one of these in each level.  When a Red Power brick is found, an Extra or Mini-game becomes purchasable in the Cantina.  Unfortunately, only a few Red Power Bricks are for extras, because sixteen of the thirty Red Power Bricks are for Mini-games.

ACTIVATION LOCKS
Occasionally, when a droid, Stormtrooper, Sith Lord, or Bounty Hunter opens a lock, an activation mini-game must be played before the lock is unlocked.
 - Protocol Droids must touch falling LEGO bricks on the touch screen that match those on the upper screen.
 - Astomech Droids must spin the lock so the LEGO bricks on the lock match those of the upper screen.
 - Stormtroopers and Sith Lords must memorize the positions of LEGO bricks on the touch screen, and then match the bricks.
 - Bounty Hunters must touch all the LEGO bricks on the touch screen that match those on the upper screen.
Four Red Power Bricks unlock these mini-games to be accessed from the Cantina.  All four of these mini-games are combined into the Mini-game called Activation.

CHARACTER CREATOR
Players are able to create two custom characters that can be used in Freeplay.  You can choose these characters to be Jedi (wields Lightsaber, uses Force), Sith (wields red Lightsaber, uses Dark Force, unlocks Stormtrooper doors), Blaster (wields blaster, can shoot targets, uses grappling hooks), Bounty Hunter (wields blaster, can shoot targets, uses grappling hooks, throws Thermal Detonators, unlocks Bounty Hunter doors), and Small (wields blaster, can shoot targets, uses grappling hooks, crawls through tunnels).  Not all characters’ pieces can be used in custom character (like Jango Fett or IG-88), and their arms cannot be changed from their torso.  Only Jedi, Sith, and Small can wear capes.

MUSIC
Beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.  The music in this game are fresh, crisp samples of music from the films, much better than the electronic-sounding music of LEGO Star Wars II for DS.  Ranging from Duel of the Fates to the Emperor’s Theme, the music is bound to fit your tastes.  Unfortunately, here are a few pieces that I wish were in the game, but unfortunately are not:
 - Battle of the Heroes (I was so hoping for this one)
 - Over the Stars (Episode II love theme)
 - General Grievous theme
 - March of the Droids
 - A version of Duel of the Fates with the choir
 - Princess Leia’s theme
 - Han Solo and the Princess

GLITCHES
Thankfully, there are not anywhere near as many glitches as there are in LEGO Star Wars II for DS!  However, here are two glitches I’ve encountered:
 - Only once or twice, the game froze up and I needed to turn off and turn back on the DS.
 - Only two or three times, character pieces in the Character Creator or entire characters during freeplay will become weird colors and pixel-y.
 - Only once, during Speeder Showdown, my Speeder Bike got stuck in a spot and could not get out.
As you can see, none of these glitches have occurred more than three times for me… unlike LEGO Star Wars II DS…

COMPARISONS WITH OTHER VERSIONS
As awesome as it is, there are unfortunately a bunch of disadvantages compared to other versions.
 - No new characters, like Lama Su or Aalya Secura.
 - No extra toggle characters, like Carbonite Han Solo or MSE-6.
 - Only Jedi, Sith, MangaGuards, and General Grievous have double-jumping capabilities.  Stormtroopers do not have their “falling” ability, and Han Solo doesn’t have his “diving rapid-fire” ability.
 - Arms are not customable in the Character Creator.
 - Not as many pieces can be used in the Character Creator as in other versions.
 - Characters cannot ride vehicles.
 - No snakes or bats during the Dagobah level.
 - Lack of the Naboo Swamps level.
 - Some levels are butchered greatly, such as Mos Eisley Spaceport.
 - No new Force abilities.  Although Wikipedia claims that the Emperor can do a “Force Kick” in the DS version, I have yet to find out what this is.
 - Most Red Power Bricks are for Mini-games.
 - Astomech Droids cannot stun enemies.
 - Protocol Droids do not lose limbs when hit.
 - Only two playable characters can be on-screen at a time.
 - No full-scale bar fights.
 - Chewbacca cannot rip arms off.
 - Cutscenes just aren’t as good.
 - No new levels, like Speeder Chase.

 - Almost no glitches!
Cons:

 - C3-PO does not loose limbs when hit.
 - Only two playable characters can be on-screen at a time.
 - No full-scale bar fights in the Cantina.

OVERALL
Do not take all those cons the wrong way; this game totally owns LSWII DS!  If you have a Wii, PS3, Xbox 360, or any other platform for this game, get it for that.  If you don’t, but have a DS… get this version before you think twice!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Generalstaal","2009-08-23T05:46:50.14Z","Best Hand Held Lego Star Wars","After the failure of Lego Star Wars II DS, this is a huge leap forward.
Pros: 
More Accurate to the TV consoles
All 6 Episodes!
Minigames!
A Small minigame that you play when using different access panels 
Very Fun

Overall it is a very good, and very fun game, but I have given it a 4, because, It isn't as good as Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, on the Wii, 360, or PS3

Cons:
Graphics still aren't as good
Only 5 levels in each episode, instead of 6 (although some levels are 2 in one)
No new levels or characters
No new extras, instead the new red bricks unlock minigames

I would still recommend this game to any Lego Star Wars fan, who owns a DS, but also get the Wii, Ps3, or 360 one too

"1UPminifig","2013-10-19T03:18:25.003Z","My First Review","<h4><strong><em>LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Sage</em></strong></h4>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">{For reference: Lego Star Wars: The Original Trilogy will be
referred to as LSWOT.]</p>

<h4><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></h4>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga was my second Lego Ds game
and a step down form Lego star wars the original trilogy. Don't get me wrong it's
a perfectly fine game but it felt like this was the predecessor to LSWOT more than
a sequel.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><b style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal""><em>Minifigure selection
and game play</em></b></h4>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">This is the one point where this game shines over LSWOT with
one hundred thirty-seven characters fifty six more than LSWOT including toggled
characters and this one had my favorite characters the clones added. From Samuel
L my bad “Mace Windo” to Gonk droids this game has an impressive list of characters.
There are five classes of characters in this game and they are Jedi and Sith,
bounty hunter, droids, small, and regular soldier.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Jedi and Sith use lightsabers and the force to fight their enemies,
My personal favorite force power was force lightning which is always fun. They
also have the power lightsaber block and double jump lightsaber block flings
blaster bolts back at your enemies but very rarely hits them.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Bounty hunter is the hardest class to group into one section
because there all so different. Bounty hunters usually have a very unique weapon
or ability. For example Jango Fett has two blaster pistols and a jetpack, the
only other character who has a jetpack {droids don’t count} Is Boba Fett and
the duel pistols Is unique to his characters. This is also one of the two classes
that have droids in it even though there was only one I think Ig88 should get
an honorable mention in this review.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Droids are the second worst class in the game the big problem
is that most can’t fight excluding Ig88 and battle droids. There only purpose
in the game is basically to open doors and say are game as R2d2, though to be
fair this was a problem in LSWOT to. They did however improve this class considerably
by adding battle droids but they can’t jump so you’re better off playing a
clone trooper. Two cool things about the class are that R2 units have bonus jetpacks
and destroyer droids are epic have abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The small class is the worst class and is a very small class
indeed with only a couple of characters, the only ones I can name off the top
of my head are young Boba Fett and Ewoks. They can go into small doors located throughout
some of the levels and that's about it</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>The regular solder
class has the most wide spread of characters in the game if not the most
diverse in unique abilities. The only unique regular solders are battle droids who can't
jump. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>Just about every one of them have
the same blaster and play almost exactly like each other so don't be scared to
just play the character you find most aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are two ways to unlock Lego characters the first and easiest
way is after playing a level you will automatically unlock the characters you
played, but that's just the bare minimum of characters you can get. The other
way to get characters and the only way to get the enemies and the more gimmicky
characters is to buy them from the bar in the cantina. There you can spend Lego
studs to buy the characters you want. How do you get studs you ask, well <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>when you’re playing a level <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>you will see little flashing Lego studs and
just run through them and there in your bank account. I don't remember what copper
and silver studs are worth but I know blues are worth a thousand.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">There's also a section were you can create a minifig from
the parts you have collected and you can save two of your custom minifigures. But
it's nowhere as good as LSWOT’s where you could save three characters and it
had lots of claver little additions such as the smile-face and Lego shirt. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><b style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal""><em>Game play</em></b></h4>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">If you have ever played one of the Lego star wars games you
know what to expect for those of you who don't I'll give you the run down. First
off there are six rooms each and, of these, they have levels from their respective
movies. Once you enter one of the rooms you’ll see five more doors and going in
one of them will enter you to the level proper. You are not restricted to one
movie but you have to do the chapters of a movie in order.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Once you enter a level you will be able to pick either story
mode or if you have finished the chapter already free play. Story mode is where
you play with the characters you’re assigned and some areas will be unavailable
unless you have the right class. Free play let’s you pick two characters that
you would like to play with and assigns you seven giving you a good amount of
each class. LSWOT’s free play was much better giving you all the characters you
had unlocked to play with in free-play. </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Something to keep in mind is that in a Lego game, there are
no game over-screens when you die you just lose some studs There are two kinds
of missions land and space. Land missions have you fighting on the ground with
slow moving but fun action and surprisingly good plat forming. Space missions
have never translated good to the mobile platforms and this is no exception. The
space missions play from a isometric view and are really slow and that's a big problem
because X wings shouldn't handle like star destroyers. Space missions also have
no free play option which is really disappointing because LSWOT had a free play
option which was really good allowing you to fly around in Tie fighters and
even the probe droid from <em>The Empire Strikes Back <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span></em><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Mini kits are back but totally changed for the worse instead
of like in LSWOT where they unlocked new characters and spaceships, these mini
kits are just models you can stare at in the cantina. Why they are quite nice
looking it feels like a step downward. Red bricks to the best of my knowledge
are new and all they do is unlock boring mini games.</p>

<h4><b style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal""><em>In Conclusion</em></b></h4>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">I would say this game is not that bad but it feels like a
step backwards for the series. Even though it got rid of the numerous glitches
and added a lot more minifigures then had LSWOT. I can't call it a good game because
of the problems it imports from LSWOT such as poor space missions and monotonous
level design and the problems it added like Mini kits being just models, can't
play all the characters you unlock at a time and space missions don't have free
play. I give it three bricks out of five.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,3
