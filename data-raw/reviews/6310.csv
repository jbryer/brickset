Pros:
Both LEGO Star Wars games on the new consoles
New levels
New Characters
Some levels were revamped
Revamped levels also available in unedited form
Playable Indiana Jones
Improved Cantina
High replay value

Cons:
Not enough changes
Still use old blasters
Still use old character designs
Not enough playable vehicles
Not enough new playable characters

Overall, the only reason to not buy it is if you have the first two, and even then it is worth a chance.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2009-07-12T21:51:17.343Z","""The [Saga] is Now Complete!"" - Darth Vader (Sorta) :)","Finally, after two years of development in TT Games, the Lego Star Wars universe is now complete with the joining of both prequel and original star wars triliogies into one awsome game. Lego Star Wars: The Complete saga for Wii is an awsome, funfilled game that, at first, didn't meet my expectations, but after playing it and finally beating it, it surely has. The prequel triliogy rounds(Episodes I, II, III) have been modified with power bricks unlocking new extras like stud magnet and force grapple leap; and new vehicles have been added like the stap and flash speeder. Also every round has been modified with power ups hidden within breakable lego objects. These power ups give you a list of extras right in the middle of the round if you pick one up, but they don't last forever. Also, the vehicle rounds of the prequel triliogy have been modified to the freeplay standards of the original triliogy. All prequel triliogy episodes have been modified with interesting character and minikit bonuses and super stories. Plus extra toggle use allows you to be all new characters like the buzz droid and the rancor! Other new characters include Boss Nass, Captain Tarpals, Watto, Pit Droid, Zam Wessel, Taun We, Lama Su, Ayla Secura, R2-Q5, and Indiana Jones! Also, there are 6 bonus rounds that include the Original Podrace, the Original Gunship Calvary, the Original Episode 4 round, an all new Anakin's Naboo Starfighter round, the original Lego City, and an all new lego city round called New Town. There's also even a new Two Player Challenge Mode that'sa lot of fun. The character customiser has been modified to include all character's peices. There's also a new feature within all the freeplay rounds that allow's you to complete a special challenge that consists of finding ten secretly hidden blue minikits within 10 minutes time. Also, an extra ten bounty hunter missions have been added to the original bounty missions that correspond with the prequel triliogy episodes. As you can see this game has tons of new goodies that makes it almost impossible to resist getting. The only thingdidn't like was the new stud fountain that only produces gray studs. But, it doesn't really matter considering that the score times extras are much cheaper than in the second game. So, if you're a big lego star wars fan like myself, you should definitely get this game for this great system.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It has all the important people(Luke Skywalker Obi Wan) in 1-6 and even some less important ones(Boss nass and TC-14).  The graphics are good and the levels are well designed.

minifigs;

"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-04-17T19:32:33.967Z","Great game; even better if it's your first time playing","LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga for Nintendo Wii is the two trilogies combined with some good extras. If you haven't played either games, this is the best package, each movie has 7-8 levels or so, and about each level you'll unlock some of the many characters for instant play or for purchase using the LEGO studs as currency. There are variants of two basic weapon wielders: lightsabers and blasters. Each category has varients, such as Darth Maul's double sided lightsaber, Count Dooku's Force Lightning, or 4-LOM's huge blaster, Bounty Hunters' thermal detonators, to name a few. Jedi and Sith can use their weapons via the Wii Remote to simulate in a sense using a lightsaber. Using the Z button on the Nunchuk you also use Force powers and build LEGO bricks. In addition to minifig levels, there are at least one aircraft mission per movie (from Anakin's podrace to the space battle and attack on the Death Star). Yes, for a first time player, you will be playing this game for weeks. If you HAVE played either of the games, you're getting much of the same package (moreso if you've played the Original trilogy version) but if you get bored with it, your friend can play with you cooperatively (no Wi-Fi, unfortunately) which adds a new feel to each level. My personal gripe was that Wedge isn't playable nor even referenced though his AT-AT move isn't even credited to him, and I mean theres a regular Rebel Pilot in his stead? I have to settle for this but thats my only gripe. This game's just the best, combining all three of my favorite things and it's only $20 since the other LEGO redoes of many other games. Great game--pick it up no matter how much of the other game's you've played.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"NickBrick","2011-04-08T21:08:09.587Z","This game is pretty good. But there are some bumps here and there.","GRAPHICS: Disastrous...jagged...bright. Those are the best words that describe this game's graphics. I mean, I have the original Lego game, Lego island, and it has better graphics than this.<br><br>Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty good. Although I cannot recommend this to people who already own one or two of the new Lego games because they're sooooo similar. You run around in a contained area, shooting(and occasionally punching) enemies such as battle droids and storm troopers. You have to solve a variety of puzzles throughout the game. Many of them involving building something out of Lego bricks. Most levels are on on-foot missions. Vehicle missions are a bit different and are my favorite part of the game. And, most of the vehicle levels are quite different from each other. For instance, The podrace in episode I is an on-the-rails arcade style level. While levels like the asteroid field level in episode V more like the the on-foot missions, where you fly around and collect torpedoes to <br>blast open hidden area's. There's one more level I feel I shout point out. The battle over courasant( sorry if I spelled it wrong) level. Its another on-the-rails level except it looks like<br>Lego tried to duplicate the excellent gameplay found in Nintendo's ""Star Fox"" series. And being a fan of that series, Its my favorite level in the entire game.<br><br>DIFFERENCES FROM THE FIRST TWO: There isn't enough difference here to make things very interesting. New characters as well some new levels are included. Unfortunately there isn't enough.<br><br>MUSIC: it's Star Wars. What else is there to say?&nbsp; <br><br>FINAL OPINION: (Edited on July 24 and December 23) This game is very good. As Ive been playing through it, Ive been finding more and more fun. I can easily recommend it. Overall 4.4 out of five.

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-19T14:21:13.727Z","Both LEGO Star Wars in One Package","<p>LEGO Star Wars the Complete Saga for WII: Combining two games into one, LEGO SWTCS gives us a slew of new features and expands upon the gameplay from the Original Trilogy game for the Prequel era... However, there are a few issues I have with this game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, the Prequel Era levels have not been changed in the slightest, they've added a few features found in the sequel, but the levels are still much shorter than their OT counterparts, it takes about forty-five minutes or more to get through a stage of the OT, when you're going hogwild and blowing up everything in sight to collect a massive pile of studs. Whereas the PT levels take less than 25 minutes, and if you're not blowing things up willy nilly and maxing out on stud collecting you can finish them in less than three minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, although the PT vehicle levels have been marginally improved, for some reason the Battle of Coruscant hasn't been altered too much. I mean all they added was a red Power Brick to that level. The rest of it is still on rails with certain checkpoints, but it does look a little more open compared to the original PS2 version of that stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am glad that TT and Lucasarts modified the game to include the music from RotS, it's much better hearing the actual battle Theme from RotS than just hearing Duel of the Fates again. (The PS2 Copy only featured music from the first two entries in the PT so as to avoid spoiling the new music in the climactic battle from RotS... At least I think that's right.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vehicles incorporated into the PT stages are also littered few and far between, and there really isn't any incentive to use them like in the OT. The new Bounty Hunter missions and the massive amount of Gold Bricks to collect is highly addictive and fun. Being able to play as Indiana Jones in the Star Wars Saga is also a real treat and a great feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More Jedi, more Droids, more Bounty Hunters, everything is great. I am sad to see that Yoda however has lost his mobility from the PT, since floating around in his little chair was always a hoot, but now you can't do that and so it adds to the tedium of playing as Yoda in the RotS Kasshyyk&nbsp;Stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My copy suffers from an inexcusable glitch, which I recently discovered, in the Droid Factory stage, if you are killed by the large presses, the game will freeze up and an annoying buzzing sound will happen. This isn't a big deal during regular stage play, but in Super Story mode, where if this happens you have to shut down the system and re-start it can be a pain having to go through the first two stages again only to fail in avoiding gristly death and passing that section of the game. I feel that this sort of thing should not be happening, especially since the game was basically already programmed for these stages on previous gen systems and as a port with only minor modifications these types of glitches should not even be an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, this game is a great bargain, great fun and still loaded to the brim with impressive and enjoyable LEGO Video Game fun. With brand new features for the PT and extra levels, it'll take a while to reach 100% completion. I still recommend this game to anyone who would be interested in it, but be wary of picking it up at discount prices, because you too might experience the unfortunate glitch mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could go into greater detail on the features, but we all know what they are by now I suspect. Many new characters and pieces for building your own playable character are included. And the improved vehicle stages in the PT are a definite good thing. Here's hoping that LEGO will continue to make these styles of Video Games avilable through their partnership with Traveler's Tales, because their games are genius. And don't be fooled by the simplicity of these titles, they're fun for the entire age bracket, from 5 to 55 and beyond.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
"LEGOSWHP102","2012-01-01T23:27:24.217Z","Kick some Brick in I-VI","<h4>Kick Some Brick in I-VI</h4>
<p>The Star Wars Saga returns once again in LEGO Style!</p>
<h4>Cover Art</h4>
<p>This Game contains a very obvious&nbsp;Cover(in other words, you knew the cover would be like this before looking at it). It's just like the previous&nbsp;LEGO Star Wars Games (LEGO Star Wars :&nbsp;The Video Game (2005), and&nbsp;LEGO Star Wars II :&nbsp;The Original Trilogy (2006) ) : Main Characters from the Star Wars Saga in the Front,&nbsp;Supporting Characters in the back, and a&nbsp;Major Villain's head in the very back (except in this game there&nbsp;are two villains: Darth Vader and Darth Maul).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<p>The Complete Saga still has all of the Wonderful Features from the previous LEGO Star Wars Games such as Build and Ride Vehicles, Create your own characters and play as them, and Play with a Buddy with Drop-In/Drop-Out Co-Op, but it also has lots of New Features that made the game Shine even more like New Force Powers (like using the force on Multiple Droids instead of just one at a time). The Game Introduces&nbsp;Brand New Bonus Levels that were never seen in the previous games (like Anakin's Flight), and New Playable Characters that were never playable in the other games (like Plo Koon who was later playable in the next game - LEGO Star Wars III : The Clone Wars (2011) ). Also, (on the Wii Version ONLY), you can actually move your Wii Remote as if it's a lightsaber and the Minifigure in the game will swing the lightsaber. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Like I said before, This Game Introduces Brand New Playable Minifigure Characters that were never playable in the previous games such as Plo Koon, Aayla Secura, R2-Q5, and Captain Tarpals. It still has all of the previous playable Characters/Minifigures.</p>
<h4>Levels</h4>
<p>The Levels are the same as the previous two LEGO Star Wars Games (I-II-III on the first one in 2005 and IV-V-VI on the second on in 2006), so this game is pretty much a combination of the 2 games [2 in 1] with&nbsp; 6 Bonus Levels. It should have been new levels with the same story instead of the same ones, but I still liked it.</p>
<p>It still has the Bounty Hunter Missions,(that can be unlocked once you unlock all Bounty Hunters), but instead of 10 Missions like the Original Trilogy Game, there are 20 Missions.</p>
<p>Total Levels - 62 Levels</p>
<h4>Overall : This Game Kicks some Star Wars Bricks</h4>
<p>After playing the previous games, I wanted to play this one and I am not disappointed with it.</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,5
