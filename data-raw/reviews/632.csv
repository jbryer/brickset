"MPH","2007-08-29T02:48:55.21Z","Bought it for the cannon","I like brown cannons, and this was a cheap way to get one. The rest is a pretty standard small pirate set: a minifig, a flag, a yellow baseplate, some rocks and some leafs. Not bad at all, but Lego could've been a bit more creative...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It looks like so much little, and really is, but includes some useful pieces and is good builted. The minifigure included is a pirate, also included previously in other sets of the pirates theme. I like the simple design and the color scheme. The minifigure also have a pistol and a characteristic hat of the pirates. The cannon is included and worksvery well. The scenery is also good builted and includes some plants and a flag, combined with some gray pieces to looks like stones. The cannon is in a good position to it and the small plate is also, supporting all the set. The playability is basic but it features the cannon. Altough this small set is good designed and builted, this includes no new things, but still cool. So, in overall, i rate the &quot;pirates cannon&quot; 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

You get a pirate, cannon, pistol, and other accesories. The tri cornered hat is very cool and gives it the Pirate feel. This is a good set to buy for any Pirate fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
