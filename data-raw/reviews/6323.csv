"BrickPiet44","2008-10-01T15:20:13.357Z","All time favorite","I often wondered why a fire station should have an ambulance and a tow truck. But after a visit to Legoland Billund I understood: fire services and road service were in Denmark with the same organisation. So after thirty years of so that was cleared.
The set has a simple garage with basic vehicles. 
The fire truck has a ladder and opening doors, but the ladder cannot turn around. The ambulance is a converted station wagon. But not with stickers but decorated bricks. That's a great plus.
The tow truck is, well, basic too. 
But it is the combination that makes this set my all time favorite. Three different cars are a guarantee for great playability. It takes only a few other cars and / or houses to have a complete Lego town. It's possible to play all kind of different events. OK, the flag has been broken a few times. But the tree still stands. In essence this set is a fire station, a hospital and a garage in one. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"peti7788","2022-12-07T22:27:03.397Z","Micro scale Fire station ","<p>This is one of the first miniwheel series large sets. This is the second official lego fire station, so don&#39;t expect too much.&nbsp;Fire station without life.&nbsp;Because the set does not include figures even built from bricks.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m only saying rare parts: flag, tree, base plate, 3 piece&nbsp;ladder</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>There is a special base plate that leaves space for vehicles, which is fantastic.&nbsp;The layout of the building is good, but it lacks details that would make it not a ghost town.&nbsp;For example, roof vent, street light, fire hydrant.&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are no inscriptions or stickers on the facade of the building that would reveal what kind of station this is.&nbsp;This could be some kind of mixed rescue station, since there is an ambulance, a tow truck, and a fire engine.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>It hasn&#39;t been invented yet.&nbsp;But it would have been possible to build a proportional one from 1x1 brick and 1x1 round brick.&nbsp;For example like this:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52549893625_127a34224d_k.jpg"" style=""width: 1920px; height: 1080px;"" /></p>

<h3>Vehicles</h3>

<p>The ambulance is completely correct.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem with the fire truck is that it has the same front as the tow truck, it doesn&#39;t have its own character. And only one color, too red, a white stripe on the side would be nice if it was replaced with a white plate.</p>

<p>And the tow truck is a missed opportunity.&nbsp;The same red hinge as the one used for the fire truck ladder should have been placed under the special hook part!&nbsp;The game function would be more.&nbsp;So it&#39;s too boring, and even the details are missing, nowhere is there a reference to the climbing ladder or the fuel tank or exhaust.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re a collector, I recommend it, but if you want to play with the set, it won&#39;t make you happy.&nbsp;Cute retro set but unfinished, lacking detail and life.</p>

<h3>My modification</h3>

<p>With this modification, there is already life in the set.&nbsp;Of course, I used parts available in 1970.&nbsp;The pine tree is the only exception, but I think it is forgivable.</p>

<p>First of all, I shifted the edge of the roof facade by 1 row, so it have a little depth, a more 3D effect.&nbsp;This leaves space for outdoor lights.&nbsp;I also put vent and 3 imitation windows made of 2x2 transparent bricks on the roof.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52549008527_e17ec97194_k.jpg"" style=""width: 1920px; height: 1080px;"" /></p>

<p>I also replaced the windows of the hose tower with transparent bricks. In addition, I added an imitation bell made of yellow round bricks in the upper part of the tower.&nbsp;I put a fire hydrant and a street lamp in front of the building.&nbsp;In the garage area, I changed the first row of bricks to black to give the wall a bit of contrast.</p>

<p>I modified the front of the fire engine so that it doesn&#39;t look like a tow truck, it has its own character.&nbsp;I put a step ladder on the side of the fire truck, with a 2x4 gray plate, above it with a 2x2 red plate.&nbsp;In order not to make the red color boring, I replaced the 4x12 plate with a white one, so there is a white stripe on the side of the vehicle.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52549965568_8356db6c8c_k.jpg"" style=""width: 1920px; height: 1080px;"" /></p>

<p>I completely rebuilt the tow truck to have more details, and to be able to lift the front of the cars with the hook.&nbsp;For this I used the same red hinge plate as on the fire truck.&nbsp;I also put an imitation exhaust and fuel tank on it.</p>

<p>Christmas is coming soon and I love the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10263-1/Winter-Village-Fire-Station"" target=""_blank"">theme of the lego winter village</a>, I checked out what the building looks like with a white base plate.</p>
