The tipper truck of course has a cabin that is slightly different from other cabins from that time. This time the top of the cabin has two 2x2 tiles for a roof.
The depot has space for two tipper trucks. So other trucks can join in the work or can be parked.
The belt, well, after almost fourty years it still works. It&#180;s not broken. It can be taken apart and can bet assembled again without problems. It still works as it did almost fourty years ago. And it has been played with for many years, and it is played with now again. My youngest son of 4 does need some instructions to make it work properly, but is definitely one of his favorites.
So, 5 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
