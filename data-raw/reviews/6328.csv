<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It is a simple build and I still have all the parts. The red digger arm has needed some gluing but otherwise it is all good.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I would build all sorts of vehicles using the few parts. Cabin forward, wide wheels etc. These big wheels had a unique connector system which has long been dropped from the Lego System.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>... sits on my shelf next to my more modern sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am happy that I have this set in its original&nbsp;condition.</p>
