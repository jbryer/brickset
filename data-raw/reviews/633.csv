"MPH","2007-08-29T03:03:36.973Z","Nice one!","What's not to like about this set? It's not very expensive, but you do get TWO redcoats which makes this a great army builder. I also like the whole set-up of the set, with the soldiers roasting their meat. They're hiding behind some rock formation so that those nasty pirates won't find them (although they might notice the smoke...). A green bush completes this rather peaceful scene. Great set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-27T13:36:56.437Z","Another small set to increase some big sets","This set was released in the year of 1994 and is one of the small sets of the pirates theme. Altough this not features much building, this is just to increase other sets. The building is easy and simple, not much good or bad. The minifigures are two soldiers, simple but nicely designed like all the other soldiers of this theme. The minifigures also includes two hats, a bag and a weapon. The small plate that supports the set building is little but the &quot;plant&quot; and the gray pieces that when builted makes a effect of stones are in a good position. This set also have a flame piece. Altough this set not features new things, this is good and two minifigures makes the value be greater. I rate the &quot;Soldiers Forge&quot; 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
