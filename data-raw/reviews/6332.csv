Once you know the fun and playability of minifigures, there was no going back. This car-and-caravan set therefore was something of a disappointment in itself, having no way for minifigures to ride in the car, or indeed enter the caravan (I&#39;ve just checked the brick inventory and it confirmed my suspicion that there was no door to the caravan).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bricks were versatile enough to be used elsewhere, and this is the only set I encountered which featured a hollow one-brick-high sloping windscreen, as opposed to the two-bricks-high version which became standard. However, if it had not been for this website, I might never have remembered that we actually had this as a set, rather than as another collection of bricks.</p>
