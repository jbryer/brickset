One of the small sets of the pirates theme, this is also good builted and designed. Like other, this includes a simple butnicely designed minifigure. The pirateincludes a hook and a hat. The small plate under the set building is in a good size for it. This set includes some gray pieces to make a effect of stones, a cove. The building is one of the better for small sets of this theme and it also have some pieces like the green leafs and a characteristic flag of the pirates. The treasure chest is also included. The playability is not great, but it is due to the size, so, it still cool. Altough this small set not includes new things, it is good builted for a small set. In Overall, it is a good set. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This is a perfect example.  So you have a pirate, right, and he has a treasure chest, right, and some shelter, and some signs that he's alone on an island, right.   What's missing?   With only one minifig, you can't have much conflict, and with few exciting pieces, you have to look at this as a pirate learning experience.  Say you're six or seven years old, you  learn how to build a hiding place for the treasure (good use of the LURP!), how to combine a few pieces in unexpected ways (those palm leaves become both the camouflage for the treasure hideout, and the awning for your pirate lair), and how to create an entire Pirate Space with only 45 pieces of Lego.   This prepares you for more complicated and exciting pirate building experiences in the future.  Not a bad thing, all in all.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
