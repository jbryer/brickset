"thepeopleperson","2008-05-08T20:14:31.09Z","Excellent Set! (and cheap too :-)","This is an excellent set, as I said before. Here are pros and cons.

pros:
Pretty big for $10
3 Great minifigs! (I especially like the new hairpieces for Irina and Mutt)
The cheapest set Lego has ever produced with a tent!
TONS of accessories (turkey leg, banana, guns, etc.)
The ants are cool, but way out of proportion.
Good playability (this should keep a kid busy for a while:-)

cons:
The table-breaking thing does not work very well.

","This set is great mainly because of the very intersting and realistic features which include the following: campfire, ant pieces, bannana piece, and chicken legg piece. Also, this set comes with three cool minifigures which include: Indiana Jones(with whip, of course), Mutt Williams, and the evil German lady(forgot her name); and this set's most interesting fearture, the tent which is what made this set catch my attention in the first place. Two other cool features are the rotating weapon rack and the spitting in half table. How cute! Another minor thing is that this set is also very inexpensive. This set may be very little after you build it, but as the saying goes a little goes a long way. Get this set! I highly recommend it!   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

First of all, even though it is pretty expensive at S$ 29.90, it's plenty value for money, containing three minifig representations of three of the main characters in the film. Irina Spalko and Mutt Williams also come with awesome new hairpieces. Also what's nice it that despite the relatively low piece count, this set looks like it includes quite a lot, which it does. It's always to see another of the very rare tents, and all the accessories add a very cute touch as well. The new ants, intricately desigined and amazingly coloured, look awesome, and it helps that there are three of them. The table that breaks in half during battle is a nice touch too, even if it is a little flimsy. Even though there are a few elements that seem out of place, unlike many sets this size, it doesn't look very thrown together. This is a must-have if you're on a relatively tight budget for all its admirable aspects.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"_add_um","2008-06-19T09:51:02.047Z","Mainly got it for the figs","One of the 5 sets based on The Kingdom of the crystal skull, unforuntly the scene in the film dosn't play out like the set (maybe some of the scene was cut out of the film). But this is a good set because you don't have to get a expenseive set to get Irina and Mutt,it also some hard to get pieces (3 cutlasses,gold ninja sword,2 knifes,knight's sword, a bannana, a tent, an dark orange flame, 3 ants and 2 gems). The table falls apart easily too which bugs me alot. Another indy is included giving you a hat,whip and bag which are handy for other things.

Pros:
*Its an Indiana Jones Set
*Many cool pieces
*Don't have to buy something big to get the minifigs

Cons:
*There was no sword fight at this part of the film nor were the ants
*Table breaks easily

"David1971","2008-06-01T16:30:54.28Z","Lots of little bits, but better than expected","If you bought this and were not already a fan of Lego, you might be a bit disappointed to find that the chunky cardboard box contains a couple of bags of little bits, and the tent, and not much else. 

It lacks a basic 'wow' factor. But I was assuming this set would be a bit disappointing, because it is a bunch of little things representing a 'scene' rather than being based around some solid thing such as a vehicle or building. But actually the scene is quite good because you get quite a range of stuff to play with, and, of course, three different minifigs, which is very good.

It's all tiny stuff, of course, but the cup, box, banana (banana?!), ants, pan, weapons, backpack, etc, are all nice things for the Lego enthusiast. You also get an unusual and new female hair piece - excellent.

The tent is better than expected, although not a very Lego item; but at least this is a set which contains no stickers at all, it's all printed (which is good).

Overall it's quite good, though I believe Lego is better off creating sets where you build a distinct *thing*, rather than just a number of bits and bobs.

"legoguysw","2008-09-06T06:48:04.687Z","Rather dissapointing...","With each new theme, leog releases a small set like this. It usually has around 3 minifigures, costs &#163;8.99, and has a bunch of small features, which is what this set is. It may seem great, but it doesn't always work.
This set depicts the scene in which Indy is captured by the Russian soldiers again. It has a small bench, a table that, because of the tooth pieces inside it, can stay together and be chopphed in half. It isn't cut in half in the movie, but we can assume Lego was going on Concept art here.
It also has a crate for the small pieces in the set, a campfire, and 3 ants. Lego obviously realised that the noly way to make an ant army was by buying loads of Jungle Cutters, and so put them here, even though they don't appear anywhere near this scene. Nice touch.
There is also a sword rack, for Spalkos sword, to substitutte for the suitcase that wouldn't fit swords if made by Lego.
The tent is a dissapointment, nothing inside it. It stays on the frame quite badly.
The smalls features in this set are a frying pan, banana, chicken leg, and of course the swords. None of these were in the movie, and should have been replaced with a crystal skull, which does. Dissapintment there.
The only good thing about this is the rare banana, frying pan, swords, and chicken leg, plus the figures. Indy is same as ever, if though he 20 years older than Raiders, Mutt has a cool new hairpiece and torso, as does Spalko. Oh, and the ants.
A dissapointment. Unless you are trying to build an ant army, need the small piecs in the set, or want the minifigures, don't get. This set is a 3 because Lego didn't give this set the coolness most other sets have.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-07-02T12:50:44.36Z","indy in the jungle","This set is avery small set but the great minifigs and rare little pieces make up for it. First off let me start with the features this set has.

The tent: The tent has a nice design and is a little bare in my opinion. It could have had a bed and a lamp inside. 3/10

the crate, table, and sword holder: One word for all this, EXELLENT! The amount of sword and types of swords in this set are a big suprise to me. It includes two dagers(mutt's sword), two pirate cutlasses, 1 old castle sword, and a very rare gold katana. The holder is a nice feature. The only problem is that mutt's dagers aren't shiny like in the cover. Next the crate is normal but includes a cool lego banana! Lastly the table is unsturdy and mechanism doesn't work that well but still looks nice and two gems is a nice plus. The map and lamp, along with the chicken and pan are very nice touches too this camp set.The new ants also are a big plus and can be used anywhere in lego building since they can be stuck to a baseplate. Overall these things total a 4.5/5

Last, the minifigs: Very nice miifigs are included in this set. Indy is still plain old indy which is a downer, a 3/5 for him. Mutt is a big plus because the only other set that includes are expensive. He also has a nice look and a cool hair piece. a 5/5. Last Iriana Spalko, This minifig is the centerpiece for the russian army along with the colonel guy. Nice look and very unique. 5/5

I don't really understand the weapons rack, but I like all of the swords and knives. Especially the gold kantana, which I put in my batcave. 
Also the figs, they are really nice. You know how sometimes hair pieces just won't stay on the fig? Mutt's hair is like that. 
I really like the fire, very good idea. Also the table is nice, how it splits apart. It has a nice lamp, and yet another map to the canyon of the crescent moon, I have a bunch of them now. 
And the ants which are bigger than a mini fig's head. Two ants to take down a guy. And you get three of them. 
Also some rare food pieces, I gave the banana to my monkey (the little lego monkey piece). 
No real cons, except it would have been nice to have a base for the tent, and the tent is really papery. Also in the picture Mutt's knife looks solver, but it is really just dark grey. Good set, get it. I love Indy sets. The next one that I am getting is going to be Shanghai Chase.

Other than that, this is one of the best LEGO Indiana Jones sets! Overall, 5/5!

"Dragon_Master_48","2014-01-12T19:09:35.09Z","Interesting Set, But a Bit Scattered","<p><b>7624 Jungle Duel</b>&nbsp;is one of the sets in the LEGO Indiana Jones line, specifically that of the movie Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. While I think the movie was a little bit of a disappointment, it is my opinion that the sets are absolutely wonderful, especially the Jungle Cutter.</p><p>The minifigures in this set are the standard fare for sets of this line: Indiana Jones (who appears in practically every other set, if not every set), Mutt Williams (who appears in all the major sets of this line except for the River Chase and Jungle Cutter), and Irina Spalko (who also appears in the Temple of the Crystal Skull and Peril in Peru). However, it can lead to a nice duel, as the name of this set implies. The characters, whether good or bad, also have to deal with the giant ants.</p><p>The individual aspects of this set are just okay (e.g. the tent, sword rack, and table), but mostly just provide scenery for the battle. The tent especially provides a place for the minifigures when they're not dueling, although it's a bit difficult to put them in without just lifting up the entire tent. In many cases, I feel as if this set doesn't realize its full potential in all aspects- it's more of a mishmash of different elements to build a scene of sorts.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A lot of interesting pieces, including that for the tent.</li><li>Nice combination of minifigures for playibility in such a small set.</li><li>Doesn't really represent a particular scene in the movie, but I'm fine with that!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Set is a bit scattered- literally all over the place.</li><li>Minifigs are not unique at all.</li></ul>
<p>This is a fair set, but one that doesn't really stand out among other small sets (specifically, those at or under 100 pieces). It's not necessarily a bad set, but one that falls into the category of ""I'm not sure whether I'd recommend this to everybody,"" and thus, I feel as if this set has a specific niche among collectors of this line or children who don't really care about the minor details of this set.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,4,4
"CamberbrickGreen","2019-04-10T21:36:53.507Z","More Camp Than Cate Blanchett's Peformance","<p>As a big fan of Indy, I love all the films even the dodgier episodes. The last film was unpopular, a lot of fun and somewhat tongue in cheek. I responded late to the range and managed to pick this up. You may, like me since have decided instead to stick to larger more prominent sets as you can have too many &#39;Indys&#39;. He comes with... yep, every set. Is this a keeper though? Lego rarely release camping themed sets....</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>[&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;]</strong></p>

<p>What so I&#39;m biased? Well maybe a little but genuinely, has any other Lego license so faithfully recreated a small dumpy version of a hero so well? The prints are top notch, the gear designs also and the supporting cast are a parallel in quality and effort. Though admittedly I can not see Cate Blanchett in this Irina Spalko&nbsp;minifigure no matter how hard I look&nbsp;(an actress of metamorphosis).&nbsp;Mutt&#39;s jacket deserves high marks for the detail. The leather shoulder bag is the best accessory.</p>

<p><strong>Dangerous In Tent</strong><br />
A silly fight scene ensues at the soviet camp. The symmetrical campfire is simply very good in fact, this is total mini-build territory but it gets kids some main characters for a neat little play set. The weapons rack has a nice touch of leafy jungle which the lack of, in this set is its main flaw. Pick a sword, any sword. A soviet bench and table looks the part with the camping gear: lantern, map, mug, frying pan, yeah, yeah, it&#39;s a recipe for slapstick comedy fighting. The crate has a banana and a chicken drumstick in it for crying out loud but despite insects in the jungle versus your food, this nicely represents that the soviet union at least fed their military on tour while some citizens at home just starved.</p>

<p>While you may not&nbsp;recall&nbsp;giant ants in the movie, I absolutely love these Lego pieces and think they work much better as a fun&nbsp;idea for the remote South American jungle than&nbsp;the killer swarms in the film. Large specimens of that continent are the stuff of explorer&#39;s legend.</p>

<p>And finally the tent, oh the tent. Maybe you only want bricks? Sure plate made tents are authentic but this Lego material model looks <em>so</em> good as old world canvas tentage goes, if it were not for the multiples of people, I would get more for a Scout camp. In fact based solely on this piece among a really smashing tiny inventory of pieces here, I may just keep it after all.</p>

<p>The set isn't small, it re-enacts a scene from the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull movie where Mutt and Indy have been captured and are trying to escape again. The set is made up mostly of lots of accessory pieces and props for the scene. There's a canvas tent that's a bit flimsy, but made of the same material as many lego capes and sails for the Pirate theme sets. The table build is designed to ""break"" like it does in the movie. </p>

"Jay_Kenobi_ZX","2011-11-07T20:58:11.18Z","Indiana Jones and the Tent of Doom!","<p>Okay, first off I would like to clarify that my title is not a negative statement as to demote this set. I picked this up from the LEGO Store at Downtown Disney, Florida.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box was rather small, but that's typical for a $10 set. The instructions were a little confusing at the tent building part, but after a little though I'm sure you'll figure it out. :) </p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Probably the main reason I got this: there are so many cool and rare, unique parts. My favorite is the golden katana (or ninja sword), which I thought was really neat, along with the banana, which I think was my first LEGO fruit piece. The tent is a unique structure, characterized by its rough cloth covering, which is similar in size and tecture to the cover on the wagon in 6716 Covered Wagon.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set comes with three minifigures: Indiana Jones, Mutt Williams (who I think is his son, but I never saw the movie), and Irina Spalko (who I assume is a villain). The detail on all the minifigures is great, Mutt's jacket has his name printed on it, and Irina's body could be used for a sheriff or other western folk.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Very short, to say the least. There isn't much fun in building it, unlike other larger sets where you can stare in awe at whatever is taking shape before you (at least I do that).</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed model is fun to play with, and the components can be spread out to create the illusion of a greater area. The collapsing table was also a very cool feature.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This is a nice little set with some nice parts and nice minifigures, but that's about it. Aside from the tent, I know I could have built everything else out of pieces from my own collection.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,5
