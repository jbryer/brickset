"thepeopleperson","2008-05-08T20:22:51.42Z","Awesome Set! Great Value!","This, like the rest of the Indy line, is also an excellent set. Here are pros and cons.

Pros:
A large set for only $20
4 minifigs (includes a new Marion and 2 russians!)
Again, TONS of accessories (snakes, backpack, guns, etc.)
Alligator in new Dark Green color
Include one of those mini-raft parts!
Vehicle is large and good-looking
Tree uses some new Dark Brown parts
Great playability, much like the 7622 set

Cons:
The net-trap does no work as well as it should, and the net always falls off on its own. :-(
Vehicle is large, but only accomodates one minifigs easily
Indy has to wear his shoulder bag at an awkward angle in order to fit in the vehicle

Even though there are 3 cons, I still think this is an excellent set. I recommend this to anyone who liked the 7622 set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BlackRabbit","2008-05-09T10:07:35.717Z","so good my mom wanted to play with it"," well this set was well worth itplenty of mini figs ,lots and lots of guns and a cool ampibious troop transport,the boat was alright and i made the things the gun sat on shorter because it just didnt look good and there a few animals in this set,and behind the tree theres a box just a box but you can remove it to hide stuff and the net thrower actualy works,though i find the design of the tree to be rather flimsy and frusterating,

nice car
good boat

guns

"SillyQuack","2008-05-15T09:43:26.28Z","Net-lauching, boat-tastic, Russian-ating Fantastic!","This set is superb. All you could want for a small $20 dollar set. Now lets move onto the review.

The amphibian car: Well, this may be the best part of the set. Nice position for the rifle, like the new semi-automatic pistol, VERY nice size. Love the way Marion can stand and put hand on Indy's shoulder. Only thing bad about that is that Indy's side pouch doesn't fit. 

The raft: Not much to it but amazing. The rifle looks a little out of place though. Even though I hate stickers, the ones on the raft make it look awesome.

Tree: I didn't know how well the ladder camouflages the Russian. Like how they hide the basket in the trunk. The tree itself when you take off the net is angled over to the right, making it have an old appearance. The net launcher isn't the best thing, but if you flick it it works very, very well.

All in all, this set rocks!! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The amphibious ship is good except that only one person can sit in the front of the vehicle because the chair spacing is off. However, the room in the back makes up for it. should have included another vehicle though. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lego12","2008-05-09T16:40:17.5Z"," This set is pretty cool...."," This set is fun to play with, but the trap with the net doesn't work to well. It doesn't go very far out and the tree is really small. To seat Indiana Jones you have to take off his shoulder bag. Those are my only complaints. Everything else about this set is great! This set is the only one with Marion and it has two cool russian guards, and of course, Indy! The car/boat is really cool and a pretty good size. The gas can is weird because the handle is a gun. What they don't show you is that behind Indy and Marion there is a machine gun. The set comes with really cool guns. It also comes with an extra pistol(which is used for a handle for the gas can). That is my review and I give it a 4.5 or a 9/10. Thanks for reading this review and I hope it helped! :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"jakelongdragon","2008-08-19T00:22:28.36Z","Another great Indy treasure!","Indy himself would like this set and its price! 

First, the amphibious vehicle is awesome even by itself. It is very fun to build, has really nice forest green and brown color pieces and a fantastic shape. It comes with a bunch of great features like a rifle holder, a pistol holder and tank, search lights and mudguards. 

The treetop lookout has a net trap and a camouflaged ladder with hooks on both ends. This is neat but it is not the strongest part of the set. It is more fun to reuse the pieces to make your own design/building for the bad guys.

The best part is that the set contains rare lego pieces, like a cool one piece boat with oars, a net, a large control panel, stair arches, pillars (in a single piece), some tree leaves and vegetation. The set includes cool minifigs: Indiana Jones with his complete gear, Marion and 2 bad guys (1 with the Belloq sneer). It also has a crocodile, snakes, 1 automatic gun, 3 rifles, 3 pistols, a shovel, binoculars, and a crate.

The Indy purists might say this scene doesn't show up in the movies but with this great Indy set you probably won't mind. For just $20 you have everything you need to make up your own Indy adventures and you'll still have lots of fun!

It's unusually good value to get four very nice minifigs in a licensed set at this price. The amphibious vehicle is great, and the new dark green colour is very attractive. The only shame is that Indy and Marion can almost sit side by side, like in a real vehicle, but ... not quite. There is room for both of them though, one behind the other.

  While I like the fact that the Duck is adheres as much as possible to the actual article, I'm not sure I'm too crazy about the tree hideout. While I like the fact that it adds some originality, it was not in the movie and could've easily been replaced by a third vehicle with Irina Spalko and maybe Mutt. (Correct me if I'm wrong, but was there not a sequence involving a sword fight with the aforementioned characters jumping from vehicle to vehicle?) That being said, I still love the raft and Duck with the serial numbers in AUTHENTIC Russian. (Yes, those actually are Russian letters.) I also like the fact that the set includes oars, old-fashioned rifles, and one of the backpacks that have become so increasingly rare since the end of Pirates I.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"THX_1138","2008-12-07T21:16:48.937Z","Good, but not very movie-accurate","This is a good and reasonably priced set, but it has some flaws.

-Only set with KOTCS Marion.
-The duck (Soviet amphibious vehicle) is quite cool.
-The gas cans are pretty good.
-While not in the movie, the boat is a nice touch.
-Four minifigs for $20.
Cons:
-Not only is the tree fort thing not in the movie, it isn't very cool. It should have been left out and instead a jeep like the one in Peril in Peru should have been included.
-There are a bit of stickers (I don't care but some people do).
-It isn't very movie-accurate aside from the duck (I don't care but some people might).

it has an adventurers (the older version of orient expodition) feel to it, maybe it's just me i don't know.
this set is definately worth the money.
it comes with 2 russians, indiana, marian, a bounch of guns and gas cans,
an aligator, 2 snakes, a car/boat, a raft, a tree house, and gear.

tree house:
definately my favourite part about this set, the tree house is very neat and compact. it has a table and plateu for sharpshooting.

car/boat:
definately to many stickers.
very detailed though.
it has 2 seats and storage behind them.
and it has a spare tire and a turret.

raft:
a very neat little raft,
it has a turret with a flood light.
it has storage and room for 2 minifigs.
and 2 paddles.

pros:

this set stands out of the regular lego indiana jones set's
being one of the only ones that brings back memorys of the old days with adventurers and pirates 1.
comes with alot of gear and guns.
comes with 1 minifig for every 5 dollars wich is the exact amount i like to see,
other than in battle packs.
the tree house is amazing, people of all ages could enjoy it.
and the raft is the first of it's kind in that color.

cons:

this set truly is the epitome of stickers, it comes with a ghastly amount of them.

overall this set brings up good memories but in the end the stickers and the fact that this set bores me means it gets 3.8/5.

- Flinging net. Can activate when you push a thing at the back.
- Brilliant boat/truck thing. It looks a lot like the movie's one!

<p>With the minifigures, you get four of them - Indiana Jones (which can be repetitive given he's in all the sets), Marion (who also appears in the Fight on the Flying Wing set), and then 2 Russians.

The net on the tree has a pole you can push from behind to make it drop down on a boat passing by.</p>

<p><em>Building Experience</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three things to construct in this set: the river boat, the small scout boat, and the Russian tree outpost. Building the car is intersting. There are covers used over the wheels, and a sticker to make a cool windshield. Yep, we got stickers. Some of the smaller ones may cause some trouble for you.</p>

<p>The small boat, being mainly one piece, doesn't really have anything special about it. Building it is easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Parts</em></p>

<p>This set has tons of gun pieces. You get three rifles, two pistols,&nbsp;and one automatic pistol, all in one set!&nbsp;There's also a lader piece, red coffee mug, two big leaves, four smaller leaves, one gray box, one windshield, two brown chairs, one printed piece (not sure what it is), two paddles, two propellers, and a steering wheel. That's a lot! There's also the giant piece used to hold the tree, the net, two brown poles, and five tires.</p>

<p>There are four minifigures, two Russian Guards, Marian Ravenwood, and Indiana Jones. Indy comes with his trademark fedora, a leather pouch at his side, and his wip. Marian has a dual-sided face (one side happy, the other scared).</p>

<p><em>Playability</em></p>
