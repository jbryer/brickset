"Jedd_the_Jedi","2008-07-04T01:41:47.797Z","Top of the Crop","Many fans were disappointed with the inacuracy of many Crystal Skull sets (with regards to the movie). While definitely not perfect, this set very easily earns the title of the best in the line. The Jungle Cutter, despite its brief appearance, is a truly iconic Indy vehicle and one created here with finesse and style. The ingenious solutions (such as putting wheels under the blades) and the very fun play feature of the &quot;exploding&quot; outer plates create one of the best vehicles in this line that we've seen so far. The trees are also decent, and the assortment of characters in minifig form while not spectacular is pretty cool. This is one of only two sets (to my knowledge) in which the henchman Dovchenko is included. 

While appearing nowhere in the film, the hideout is a pretty soild piece of Lego engineering, and the lifting spiderweb door is a very fun feature. Then there are of course the lovely ants. Even though they are way larger than depicted in the film, they are intricately designed and interestingly coloured. Using just the five provided, you can also re-enact the death of Dovchenko. 

Still, the selling point is the Jungle Cutter itself, and with just one look its easy to tell why this is the must-have Indy set of the season.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"MandalorianCandidate","2008-12-25T14:14:55.747Z","A unique set for 10 seconds of screen time.","I just want to say that I love Lego.  Their twist on media-derived sets amazes me.  The initial SW sets back in 1999-2000 were great in that they threw in their $0.02 on making sets that were close to what we saw in the movies but with a little derivation.  The Jungle Cutter carries on that tradition that has been unused since then.

Definitely not as large as what was in KotCS, it's a decent size that can be handled well by the younger Lego fans and doesn't take up too much room on the display shelves of AFOLs.  Lego could have taken the Clone Wars approach and made a more costly behemoth but I think their approach is nice.  Like the original SW sets, they added the odd colored bricks for some building variation; these are mainly in the tread section of the vehicle.  I dig the forest (dark) green and lighter green and blay accents that make up the body.  Nice touch that they made those colors match with the green of the River Chase set and the Jungle Cruiser brickmaster throw-in.  Other pluses are the greebly features, like the engine exhaust pipe and 'cam' pieces for the engine and the tank treads.  They add to the realism of the set.

However, other than the rotating cutter blades and pop-up engine cover there's not a whole lot of playability with the set.  With some modding you can add some handholds for some extra troopers to ride along on the outside, which would add some coolness value to it.  The other big negative for me is that the driver section (cockpit?) is juuuuust big enough for the driver to sit in.  You have to pop the top off to get him in OK, but from the design it looks like that's what Lego had in mind.  The rod to pop off the engine cover is just under the driver seat, which makes him sit up high, thus the tight fit.  It's doable but I would prefer a little more clearance.

The thing that really improves this set is the jungle temple entrance thing.  Much of the jungle plant elements are the typical ones from sets of this type (like the 7623 Temple Escape) and they give it some realism but they do get in the way if you are fiddling with the minifigs.  The geared raising spider web is a nice feature, something that could have been used in earlier sets like Jedi Defense 2 or Jabba's Message.

My big complaint of the KotCS sets is that they are so 1-D of the movie...the jungle portion of the film.  That being said, they all work together to make a nice continuous flow of diorama making.  The Jungle Duel miniset works well adding to the Jungle Cutter's 5 ants making Gen. Dovchnko's demise more fun to set up.  River Chase is a nice complement to the pursuit in the Jungle.  The temple entrance portion I think would work well with the Akator set.  One dimensional yes but all four mesh together well.

Other comments:

- Yet another Indy (I suppose this is nice if you only end up getting one IJ set)
- Only 4 minifigs (this is the only one with the Gen--he's not a big whoop--and the two soldiers are identical to the ones from River Chase) it would have been nice to have maybe an extra soldier and a couple more guns
- Treasure box with gems and a tool set
- Rocket launcher (basically a hex wrench, flick missile, and gray cup)
- No exploding blades like was done in the movie
- Three jungle trees (they keep coming off the base--but maybe it's that way on purpose)
- STAMPS--yuck! (STickers Across Multiple PartS)

All in all it's a nice set.  I suppose the price is fair and we are getting better than 10 cents a piece.  It's just not my favorite and I think it's slightly better than average, but a worthy addition to the growing IJ collection of Lego sets.

"Brickman193","2009-01-16T06:17:05.25Z","Blades, Bugs and Plants","Wow, what a set. I've seen this on the shelves since May 08, but I never got round to buying it. Then came the New Year sales and I picked it up.

THE MINIFIGS
Four minifigs: We get Indy (as always), Colonel Dovchenko (the awesomely detailed and armed Russian leader) and two Russian soldiers. I'm not reall impressed by the soldiers (one has the generic soldier / Bruce Wayne face and the other has Belloq's). However, it's nice to have Indy and Dovchenko.

THE HIDEOUT
A totally random little cave for Indy to launch his RPG attack from. The cave has a raising-and-lowering web, complete with spider and vines, as well as a small frog and a cache of tools and diamonds (yay!). The cave is well built, with a nice grey and green colour scheme and plenty of vegetation.

THE JUNGLE CUTTER
The centrepiece of the set. The Jungle Cutter is ably impressive and ends up with a whopping 23cm from cabin to blade tip. The Jungle Cutter, like the Russians and the cave, is rendered in a nice deep green colour with some ugly yellow, blue and red bricks thrown in (luckily they're not spottable once finished). Only two gimmicks with the Jungle Cutter, and both work; if you press the tube on the back of the tank, the engine blows up (and can be reconstructed quite easily). The second gimmick is the spinning blades. No gears or technic systems here - the blades spin with the wheels underneath them. All in all, a sturdy, cool looking vehicle of destruction with plenty of playability.

THE ANTS / TREES
I love the ants. They are freakishly huge (only two ants to take down a minfig) and you get FIVE of them! Add that to the three you get in Jungle Duel and you have an small tide of killer ants. The trees in this set are quite weak, but I suppose they need to be for the tank to cut them over. Nice green colours again, with a swampish vegetation look achieved.

CONCLUSION
All in all, probably the best of the KOTC sets in terms of playability and variety. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"SaintElsewhere","2009-08-06T23:56:43.857Z","That poor devil Dovchenko never stood a chance. All he had was a machine gun, two minions, and a grossly oversized sawmill on wheels; whereas Indy had a whip and five hungry army ants...","... Not to mention cunning; a rocket launcher; a PhD in goon dispatching; a boxful of tools including a wrench, a hammer, and a drill; etc. Wait... I'm starting to see where the Russians went wrong. Oh, well. They made a good effort.

The Jungle Cutter is an ingenious piece of engineering in the way of evil military intimidation. The two saws are just the right height to horizontally bifurcate an enemy, and they move when you roll the Cutter along the ground thanks to two small wheels on the undersides that just touch the saws. There's also a sort of cowcatcher device to shove debris out of the way, and four wheel pieces that I believe represent (and mind you this is just my opinion) a wood chipper. Perfect for chewing up trees and slow-witted goons. *wrings hands, laughs sadistically* And, true to the film, part of the Cutter detaches when you push the lever in back. Of course the result isn't as fiery as in the movie, and our hero doesn't have to duck a flying saw blade, but it's a fair representation. And, as an added bonus, the letters you see on the Cutter are, indeed, in Russian. I've yet to translate them, but I shall in due time.

Now we come to the small cave. It's really no great shakes, but it does have a boxful of tools and three gems; plenty of greenery growing all over it; and, as I'm sure has been noted no less than thirty times, a spider web that moves up and down with the rotation of a gear. That's all there is to say. Oh, and there's also a frog.

Now we come to the minifigures. The soldiers are nothing new, with Generic Face (sounds like a Dick Tracy villain) having appeared in River Chase and Tchotchkie Sneer (American Dad reference) making cameos in Peril in Peru, River Chase, and Temple of the Crystal Skull. Indy is the same ol', same ol' once again. The only interesting fig is Dovchenko. His uniform is incredibly detailed, his face seems very evil and arrogant, and the small scar over his left eye reeks of thought and planning.

Pros:
Dovchenko's death scene is easily recreated with the ants
Dovchenko is pure awesomeness
same applies to ants
Jungle Cutter's design is perfect for the tank fight from Last Crusade

"legoDad42","2010-02-28T22:38:00.967Z","Execellent Indy Set!","For me, this was a very nice surprise build. Upon first seeing it displayed in Toys R Us, it didn't strike me, but LEGO dot com had a sale last winter for $30 US and I jump on it to my delight.
Excellent representation of the 'jungle cutter' from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Good, fun build, nice mini-figs and a well designed jungle cutter/tank.

PRO's - Vehicle design exterior with the giant saw blades that spin simultaneously with 2 rubber wheels beneath along with the tank treads. Moves well on smooth and rough surfaces. Interior Jungle Cutter has a well designed engine. Simple but nicely designed driver's station and just below it (rear of vehicle) is a technique pin that when you push it in, snaps open the engine (middle of vehicle) simulating an explosion to the engine. Very well done!

The set also comes with a nicely designed cave. Here you have a technique gear attached to a web with a spider which goes up and down at the entrance. The cave is adorned with foliage and the playability is excellent as this can be an area to hide a box, jewels and tools along with an rpg weapon and extra grenade. 

Along with all of this you get 5 giant ants, 3 trees (nicely designed) for the 'jungle cutter' to cut and knock over (doesn't snap in half too well but they do topple over), and 4 excellent mini-figs (Indiana Jones, Colonel w/pistol, 2 guards with different  face designs, and the aforementioned box with 3 jewels(yellow, red, blue), One RPG with extra grenade, 5 tools (oil can, wrench, drill, screwdriver, hammer) and also one rifle for the guards. Ah...one more thing, you also get a neat little frog, small but very realistic looking (a nice surprise touch).

CON's - Really none except if you count the 'cave' in this kit which wasn't a scene in the movie and the original price at $50 US was a touch high but not a deal breaker.

Overall I highly recommend this kit to Indy fans and fans of cool working vehicles.

<p>This set is a war machine of devastation and destruction. Paired with other sets, it works really well, but by itself, it is also amazing. I would recommend this to any LEGO fan.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
"TheLEGOFanatic","2009-12-26T14:31:10.483Z","What a cool set (in my opinion)","Back in 2008, I wanted this set, but I only had $30 and it was $40 so my dad said I had to save more money unless I agreed to go to Panini's with my dad, which I did. The box was a contributing factor for why I wanted it. When I finished it, it looked so cool. Now here's my pros and cons:

Pros:
Nice hiding place (even though it wasn't in the movie)
Vehicle looks cool
A few weapons
Sturdy
Price was right

Cons:
None",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Montana_8","2009-12-26T20:01:12.967Z","Worth the money"," The Lego Indian Jones Jungle Cutter was a good deal. It had a very nice variety of weapons, tools, gems, and other equipment. This set works really well with other Indian Jones sets and even Lego adventures. The Jungle Cutter looks a lot like it does in the movie. It is a very nice representation. It is built perfectly at minifig scale. Great Gift.

Pros:
Detalied Pieces
Nice minifigs
Jungle cutter works nicely

Cons:
Some pieces break easily",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>PROS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 minifigs indiana jones (of course), colonel dovenchenko and 2 gaurds(russian)5&nbsp;ants</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hide out</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bazooka with flick fire rockets(2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 trees</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door on hide out(spider web) goes up when you turn the gear on both sides of hideout</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you can sit a minifig at the controls of the jungle cutter (obviusly)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as you roll around the jungle cutter the blades spin with it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tool box filled with lots of accesories</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; story is not movie accurate</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could have included irina spalko</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should have included at least a car for indy</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and thats pretty much it&nbsp;I would really recommend this set it is NOT availible at lego shop at home (but for some reason still in stores) well stay tuned for my next daily review!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AETerry","2011-05-22T13:21:53.307Z","Jungle Cutter Review","<p>It's not one of my more favorite sets in the Indiana Jones theme, still it's fairly good at $40. It recreates a scene out of the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull movie where the Russians are moving through the Jungle headed for the ruins and temple. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest part of the set is the Jungle Cutter itself and I found it's build very enjoyable and detailed. The engine has detail work for it so you can lift a part and see it inside. The treads were a bit difficult to work with and keep on the Cutter. Still it shows a fairly decent lego brick rendering of this vehicle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you've got a build for 3 trees that the cutter can chop down with it's blades. The ruins that provide the entrance to the Temple. Several large lego army ants that attack the Russians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4 minifigures fill out this set, further adding to the value with the General, Indy himself and two Russian soldiers. Plenty of accessories and some gemstone pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me the set works best for a Collector picking up the sets. Playability seems to be alright and the Cutter is built solidly, it doesn't fall apart aside from the tank treads.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
