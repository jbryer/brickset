"savepuffy","2008-04-26T19:24:53.437Z","Amazing!","I got so lucky to find this at toys r us in saskatoon. First of all there are many minifigures(10) and the akator skeletons are so cool.  The twisting staircase works well, so does the giant moving thing at the top of the temple.  The missiles behind the waterfall work extremely well and the spinning gold thing actually spins!  It's fairly big, nice detail and comes with Mutt, Indy,Irina, Ugha warriors(2)3 akator skeletons,1 normal armed skeleton and a russian guard with a tankish like vehicular unit.  The moving dragon heads also work well.  Overall,  IF YOU SEE IT BUY IT!

Has tons of rare lego pieces, such as the three crystal skulls, a clear diamond, and unique colored pieces. Includes lots of traps, I'll try to name them all. Has exploding stairs, flick a fires, skulls that drop, arrows that shoot from the wall, and a moving staircase and wall. The obelisks fall and drop down blades, though I think it should have been more movie accurate by dropping a trap door instead. The best part is the throne platform of the akator skeletons, which moves forward while spinning, kind of like the Tony Hawk's Big Spin ride at Six Flags. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ponkusjr","2008-06-07T21:08:22.077Z","Hours of fun","This is a great indiana jones Lego set with lots to play with. Ten nice looking minifigs but disapointing not to have a different indie. The indian guys look great and the crystal skull skeletons are nice.
The calapsing staircase works well but when displaying the set we fix the steps down and put the small gold square elements somewhere safe.
I find the opening column very stiff and cant get the sides to drop down onto the rubber pads.
I spinning chairs for the skeletons works really well and the waterfall looks great. The skeleton gate is good and fits really well onto the set for display. The tracks work well on the little car and it looks good to.
All in all this is a fantastic set and well worth the &#163;62.00 i paid for it.
pros :
looks great
nice stickers
lots to keep you amused
lots of minifigs
strong set

Cons :
same Indiana minifig

"indykid","2008-08-10T02:07:12.653Z","Incredible!","Although the akator in the movie only has about two of the traps from the set this set is still great! The extra traps make the set even cooler! As stated by many, it should have included Oxley (who should be in more sets than just this one) Marion, and Mac(who like Oxley shuld be in more sets than just this one.) this set has several decals too. now on to the traps! the falling stairs are neat but they fall off really easily but whatever. the falling skulls are cool. the obelisk/pillars are cool too and the have swinging swordson them. the missles shoot really far at first but eventually they don't fly too far. the moving stars are good especially with hte spike pit underneath. the door just like in the movie which leads to a room ( this room could be used for the treasure room, all you need is the golden idol, the ark from the truck chase and [optional] the ark from the tomb) and of couse the spinning throne room which uncovers an endless pit. oh and i almost forgot that the eyes in the archway pop out too. There is also a rare clear crystal included in this set which is really cool! a lot of the upsides to this set make up for the downsides so overall this set is a 11.5/10.

Pros:
10 Mini-figures
Amazing Traps
Cool Design
HUGE!
Very similar to movie (Throne room actually spins!)
Fun to build (4 hours or so)
Compliments a collection well
Comes with a neat Russian Vehicle 

Cons:
Obelisk is rather touchy
Stairs sometimes fall when not triggered
Only one Russian  
No Mac, Oxley, or Marion (I guess Marion comes with other sets)
Lots of stickers (I really don't mind)

Overall, well worth the money!

P.S. The Arch thing fits on the building, right after the first flight of stairs!

"saber755","2009-04-13T15:10:20.233Z","magnetic crystal skulls, wow. (o.o)","hello, this is my personal favorite indiana jones lego set out of everyone but peril in peru. (wich i do not have so i cannot judge by that) the playability is endless fun. the piece count is generously done, but i have to give value for money 4/5 because the majority of the pieces are extremely small. the minifigs in this set are endless. theirs 3 akator skelletons, 1 conquestador skelleton, irina spalko, russian soldier, mutt williams, 1 ugha warrior with black fro and 1 ugha warrior that is bald, and indiana jones. their are many weapons:2 black axes, 2 pirate swords, (for spalko) 2 daggers, a rifle, and a bull whip. the acessories for the minifigs are indys sachel, but thats it. the skellys have a hole in the back of the head where lego injected the blue plastic. the traps:

falling staircase
swirling stairs,
spinning chamber,
falling skulls,
lots of flick firing darts.

secret things:
secret door,
turning statue with gem,
huge tower that if pushed raises the blades.
now for the pros and cons.
pros: many traps, secrets, and minifigs,
lots of weapons, a giant chunk of beutifull dark tan plastic, (also known as the baseplate) and a cool mini tank without the gun.

cons: to many small parts for $80, (u.s.) only 3 akators instead of 13, (it doesn't bother me, but for the lego/movie purists that might be of importance) and the only con that bothers me is the piece on the bottom of the neck of the crystal skulls that isn't polished really well.

"HQuiff","2009-02-16T12:24:02.28Z","Go Indy!","I got this set just last year for my birthday, and let me just say, ""WOW""!
A few before I got it I saw the movie, so I can say that this set is the ""most like the movie"" set in years! It's almost flawless!
I haven't had that many skellies in the past, so this really boosted my army, and now I can take over the world! Hah! Sorry.
Anyway, I have to say, this set is enjoyable! I had so many games with it, I even played a completely different theme and yet still it didn't fail to content me. 
The functions are magic too, the falling steps, slashing blade (It activates when you push down the top thingy), shooting missiles from both the Temple and the other entrance, and of course the spinning table and opening door! 
So yeah, this is pretty much perfect!
The only thing I will say is that after a while (Two months or so) you start to lose interest, but I suppose being a versatile set with an awesome board it makes up for that small loss.
Onto the pros and cons now I suppose:
Pros:
- Ten Minifigs including the skellies and the crystal skullies.
- Falling Stairs.
- Detachable head entrance with firing missiles.
- Slashing blades and an easy to push down top thingy (What is the name of it?)
- Russian Soldiers' mini tank.
- Cool dark tan baseplate.
- Firing missiles by the waterfall.
- Spinning table with the chairs of which the crystal skullies sit.
- Movable Staircase with spikes underneath 
- And Falling skulls.
Cons:
- The falling stairs are sometimes tricky to put back up.
- Stickers!
- The moveable staircase is a little wobbly.

I highly recommend it to any fans with taste!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MetroiD","2009-01-26T13:07:52.827Z","A must-have set for Indy fans","Well, the title says it all - this one is a must-have set for all Indy + LEGO fans out there.<br><br>As to me, I personally can't say I'm that much of an Indy fan, so I got this set mostly because it was available at a knock-down price and I was intrigued by the multiple booby traps (and, of course, the parts used in them!)<br><br>Upon finishing the set, I must say I was pleased but not really impressed. However, at the end of the day, this one is aimed pretty much exlusively at Indy fans &amp; adventurous kids, so despite being neither an Indy fan, nor a kid anymore (well at least not in terms of age), I did enjoy this one. It really is a great adventurer's set, however, it's not THE best LEGO set ever, at least not to me.<br><br>The temple itself consists of several modules which are built separately and then placed on the huge baseplate. This gives the set an adventurous feel and is a source of seemingly endless exploration when it comes to booby traps and hidden passages. However, that is also the primary reason why the temple looks a bit ""unfinished"", albeit full of surprises. The entire construction looks and feels flimsy and I definitely think that it could have benefitted from some more work in order to achieve a more accurate portrayal of that distinctive Maya-styled pyramid look.<br><br>On the bright side though, this set offers plenty of minifigs, including quite a few special ones (Akator skeletons anyone?) AND a very good selection of diverse bricks which can be put to good use should you feel like creating an adventure set of your own. Furthermore, the baseplate can be used as an excellent starting point for any BIG creation.<br><br>Pros:<br>+ great minifigs &amp; Akator skeletons<br>+ tons of booby traps, high playability<br>+ huge baseplate and great bricks<br><br>Cons:<br>- flimsy and a bit unrealistic / unfinished look of the entire construction<br><br>To sum up, I must say this once again: this set IS great.

"kcrmccoy","2009-12-27T11:58:42.107Z","Awesome Temple Filled with Great Traps!","-------Introduction: I got this set for Christmas even though I didn't ask for it. It's really awesome! Let's Get Started!

CAUTION! GIANT REVIEW AHEAD!

--Basics:--
-------------------

---Box: Great presentation on this set. The front of the box shows you all of the set in the front and in the back it shows all of the back of the temple. The back shows off all the different features that the set has.

Verdict: 10/10 - Great

---Instructions: Normal except that there are two instruction manuals. Each one has an average of 75-ish pages

Verdict: 8/10 - Average

---Bags: This set comes with 6 bags that are numbered. Each one of the bags also have smaller bags.

Verdict: 7/10 - Nothing special, average.

---Building time: It took me 3 hours and a half, to 4 hours and a half to build. Except for the hour and a half that it took me put the stickers on the base plate (I'll get to that later...)

Verdict: 7/10 - Average

---Price per Piece: My parents got this set on a black Friday sale for $50 instead of $80. With or without the sale, it's still a good deal. With the sale it was almost 5 cents a piece which is a really good deal.

Verdict: 11/10 - Outstanding

-------------------

Ok, now that we have the basics of the set let's Break it down:

--Minifigures:--

There are 10 minifigs that come with this set. Here's my verdict:

--Indiana Jones-- A standard Indy with whip, satchel, etc. Verdict: 7/10 - Normal
--Mutt Williams-- Standard Mutt with dagger. I don't have one so the Verdict: 9/10 - Great
--Irina Spalko-- Standard Irina w/ sword. I also don't have one so the Verdict: 9/10 - Great
--Russian Guard-- A normal Russian guard. The instructions call for him to have a gun. He drives the mini-rover. 6/10 - Nothing Special
--Ugha Warrior 1-- An Ugha Warrior with black long hair. The design on him is cool and he has an axe although that the box shows that he has a spear. You can only get these warriors in the set so: 10/10 - Amazing
--Ugha Warrior 2-- An Ugha Warrior without hair. The face is the same as the Ugha Warrior with hair and this one still has an axe. I wish that he was a little different but it's still cool. Verdict: 9/10
--Skeleton Conquistador-- A newer style of skeleton with the arms like battle droids. It has the evil skeleton face, silver-ish body plate thing, and conquistador hat. I didn't have a conquistador hat so this is great. Awesome skeleton, Verdict: 9/10 - Awesome
--Crystal Skeleton (x3)-- Once again, a newer style of skeleton with the arms like battle droids with the special Alien Skull piece. It's not as shiny in the commercials and stuff, but it does have a blue brain. Pretty good, Verdict: 8/10 - Great

-------------------

Little Rover Thing:

This little rover thing was ok. It's pretty good, but it could have been a lot better. First off, it does look kind of interesting from the box, but when you build it, it's disappointing. It only consists of less than 50 pieces and looks like they through it together real fast without re-thinking the thing.

On the side of the thing there's a big whole in it. They should have inclueded more piece to fix it. And also there isn't a good sense of control for the vehicle. There are only two levers for the minifig to control it.

Verdict: 5/10 - Disapointing, could have been better.

-------------------

Statue/Entrance tower:

This is surprisingly a good part of the temple. The little rover can just barely fit through. The eyes have flick-fire abilities and they actually work. It requires two stickers on the bottom through. It also has a place on the temple where you can take it on or off. I leave mine on the temple to make it better. 

Great addition to the set, Verdict: 8/10 - Great

-------------------

Left side of the front of the Temple (You might want to look at a pic):

This is a great part of the set, on the bottom it has a swiveling thing with a diamond on it with two spears on the side. On the top it has a trap where you pull a skeleton head and a skeleton head falls on someone below. It requires two stickers.

Verdict: 9/10 - Awesome

-------------------

Right side of the front of the Temple (You might want to look at a pic):

Another great part to the set, this part has a set of light grey stairs behind it, a cool trap where you turn a technic knob and it shoots flick-fire missiles, another skull dropping trap, and a water fall. The waterfall sticker looks pretty cheezy, but I'm able to tolerate it. This part requires three stickers.

Verdict: 9/10 - Awesome

-------------------

Exploding stairs:

This is one of my favorite parts of the set. All you have to do is turn the dragon or Fenris wolf heads and a technic piece shoots the stairs back. Although it doesn't blow up the last stair piece very well. It just turns foreword for me. You have to reset the stair pieces afterward. No stickers

Verdict: 10/10 - Outstanding

-------------------

Stairs in the back of the exploding stairs:

A normal set of stairs almost the same as the exploding ones. These can be taken off kind of like the statue/entrance thingy (except your characters need this!). No stickers.

Verdict: 8/10 - Not jumping out of my seat, but still good none the less.

-------------------

Giant center pillar (Or what ever you want to call it):

This is a good part of the set except that it only kind of works. There is a scythe trap that is attached to it. You press it down and the scythe goes up, and when you lift it up the scythe goes down. When the giant wing looking things are up, I can never get them both to be identically standing straight. When the wingy things are down, they do rest on rubbery black things on top of the two sides of the temple. It can be hard at times to press the thing down, but it's still cool. It has 5 stickers to it.

Verdict: 7/10 - Good but kind of annoying at times

-------------------

Swivel staircase:

Now we review the back of the temple. The swivel star case is sweet. It is right behind the right side of the front of the Temple (You might want to look at a pic). The bottom of it is head down by a stud so you can have the stairs swiveling to the left or to the right. The only difference is that one side has spikes beneath it, and one doesn't. This is fun to play with and has no stickers.

Verdict: 9/10 - Awesome

-------------------

Weird roomy looking door moving thing (Look at the picture above):

A very small and weird addition to the set. It is right under the giant center pillar (Or what ever you want to call it). In the movie, it is a door that they need to go through to get to the skulls (which makes sense). If you look at the picture, that's the way I have mine. But when you move it to the side for you characters to go by, looks like a weird jail. It's very strange and I advise you look at the picture above to see what I mean.

Verdict: 6/10 - ...Interesting...

-------------------

Crystal Skull Throne Room:

A great part to end the set. It has three chairs for the three crystal skeletons to sit on. There is a very cool trap where you pull this tab on the side and the room turns in a circle thus revealing a bottomless pit of doom! Very fun to play with! Although, the room can be hard to have it turn, it can get stopped when turning, and only reveals half of the hole (kinda). Awesome part of the set.

Verdict: Awesome - 9/10

-------------------

--The Final Verdict:--

Ok so here's the review in a nutshell:

PROS:
- Awesome minifigs
- Great playability
- All parts of the temple can be removed for storage
- Great traps (There are like 10)
- Goes great with other Indy 4 sets
- Great pieces
- Great baseplate
- Great to play with friends
- Very big
- Worth your money
- Didn't relate to the movie that much

CONS:
- WAY too many stickers! (There are 36 of them and 20ish go on the baseplate! What the heck Lego!)
- Some of the traps kinda only half work.
- No Marion, Oxley, or Mac minifigs
- Didn't relate to the movie that much

OVERALL:

Buy it. Packed with good minifigs, great traps, a fun build, and much more, this set is worth your money. It gets:

9/10

It has a couple minor flaws, but in the end...It's amazing.

Hope this helps!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"dk_devilkid","2009-12-26T21:35:20.967Z","The best Indy set in my collection by far.","This set is so freaking amazing! I'm gonna have to break it down into multiple paragraphs. It comes with a car which isn't all that great but doesn't detract from the set. I do like the treads on it though.

This set has 10 minifigs. Mutt, Indy, my first Irina Spalko, a russian soldier, 2 ugha warriors, 3 akator skeletons, and an armored skeleton. Mutt is probably the minifig that looks least like the real character. Irina is probably my fav from this set.

The temple itself is the coolest terrain I have. It is enormous with many traps. A the top of the middle tower you can pull up which causes a blade to go down on the stairs and the two giant pillars go down. There is a place for the skeletons to sit. When you pull on the switch it spins out to reveal a ""bottomless"" pit. There is also a sliding door, moving stairs, and spinning statue.

Other traps include shooting eyeballs on the entrance statue. There is another one of those on the little stair way on the right tower. On the big stairs there are two traps that drop skulls. To top it all off at the base of the stairs is a lever that when you pull knocks the stairs away.

Pros: 
Many cool minifigs.
Awesome temple with movable entrance statue and traps. 
Movable throne room, door, stairway, and statue with spears.
Just looks friggin amazing.

Cons:
Stickers
Not much point in the car.

PRO's - Overall design, the traps are collapsing stairs, skull drops, darts, swinging swords, retractable stairs w/hidden spike trap, spinning bridge for the crystal skull alien pilots w/hidden pit fall, etc., cool small half-track tank, 10 mini-figures, unique crystal skull lego heads (which you can see a brain inside), hidden rooms (one spins to reveal a crystal gem), tiki headed designed archway that stands alone or mounts onto the temple (has darts for eyes and extra darts as a head-dress), large base plate to build the temple on which makes it sturdy as well as easy to move and pick up.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED set if you're an Indiana Jones fan or adventure fan in general. Lot's of fun!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-05-19T16:52:37.997Z","Temple of the Crystal Skull Review","<p>For a lego set, this isn't a bad design and version of the actual temple seen in the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull movie. On one hand you have to pretend that everything is inside and not out in the open. For the details put in, they got the main features of the Throne Room where the Alien skeletons are sitting, the ""obelisk"" on top of the Temple and some of the rooms. The details were fairly good too for Meso-American ruins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've got then too 6 minifigures, 10 in all if you're counting all of the skeletons. Three Aliens, Conquistador skeletons. Mutt, Indiana Jones and then the Russians. A tank mini build as the group heads in to the valley where the Temple is located.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all, it's not a bad set. Great for those who are collecting up the Indiana Jones theme. My real complaint has been with the ""obelisk"" build and that it's 3 sides keep falling down instead of staying upright as seen in the picture.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
