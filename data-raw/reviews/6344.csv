"Ant","2008-05-15T11:30:58.577Z","One of the best sets I've built in a long time","I was surprised to find this and most of the other Coast Guard sets available on a local South African Website, www.creativeplay.co.za.

The set is divided into two models, each having separate instruction manuals, the Life Raft and the Helicopter itself.

I built the Life Raft first, which is about 103 parts. Its a pretty sturdy (i tried dropping it from a bit of a height) and is quite a nice build. The floor of the raft it completely solid (I was worried it might not be) and even has a small crate to hold a life-jacket. Jedi star-fighter wings are used as the sides and I'm glad to see TLC found another use for them. I'm not sure if this is a new piece, but the hinges have a clip bar instead of the normal click hinges. This is also the first time we're getting a shark in dark-bley (the last set containing a shark was 7082 in 2004).

The helicopter is divided into 3 sections, the parts for each being contained in separate bags. 
The first bag builds the cabin and cockpit of the 'copter. The helicopter is very well proportioned. The cockpit is 5-wide and seats a pilot and co-pilot comfortably. It also has a detailed (sticker) console which is at the correct height for once (not a foot-stool like some vehicle consoles become). The cabin also has the right amount of room I'd imagine a helicopter of this size to have, and houses a winch with Power-Function mechanism, and a gurney for a rescue-victim. The Power-Function winch is brilliant - when folded in, it locks into place in the cabin (though not that well) and has adequate power to lift a minifig. It wasn't, however, able to lift the Life Raft. The nose cone also has a new piece - similar to the piece used for dresses by castle minifigs, but 1x2 instead of 2x2.

The next bag contains pieces for the tail section , roof, and windshield. Not much to say here, except that the only juniorised part here is the hull for the tail, as in the new passenger and cargo jets.

The last contains pieces for the tail rotor, doors and main rotor. The rotor blades are also new parts and the doors work well, opening on both sides and leaving no gaps for any nay-sayers to complain about.

Overall, this is an amazing set which I expect many will say is the set of the year, if not one of the best sets produced bu TLC ever.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legobuilderguy","2008-05-23T02:48:05.983Z","Great job","Okay I bought this set with set# 7739, the boat and tower set, and I have to say this is great. This set makes use of the airliner parts and the new cargo plane parts in the orange/white color scheme I am coming to enjoy. The build for the helicopter was challenging but not overly so. Once completed this thing looks beautiful, the box art and pictures here do not do it justice at all. This looks very much like the coast guard choppers that are in use today. The life raft looks good also. It is of the type in use by new ships, like tankers and cargo ships with limited passengers and crew. A good looking set all around I must say.
Now onto the pros and cons of the set.

Pros:
Beautiful chopper
Great life boat
Power return winch
4 mini figures
Orange/white color scheme

Cons:
The rotor blades of the choppers and pop off easily and being made of two pieces to make the 8 blades it was a bit of trial and error to get them to sit right together.

All in all a great set to build and display. I can see that it would have great playability as well because it's all pretty sturdy as long as you don't try to pick it up by the rotors, the pin will come out.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

First off, I love the colour scheme for the new Coast Guard kits and the rescue helicopter looks incredible with the blue, white, and orange paint job.  The main model itself is nice and big, exactly the sort you see in real life that perform maritime search-and-rescue.  No real downside to the kit other than the stickers that I never seem to get to go on properly.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The helicopter looks very realistic and same with the raft. the doors on the chopper open up great and stay there without falling back down. and the doors are on both sides! the Cockpit is very well designed and fits two pilots.the minifigs are sooo cool!especialy the coast guard figs! this set has lots of stickers that NEVER go on right. and the inteirior of the choper could have been designed better.the front wheels on the helicopter spin too much, especialy if your playing with it. it is easily modded.(i moved the front wheels back one whole and it stoped spinnig)

+beautifuly desined
+awsome figs
+realistic
+you dont have to roll the rope back up! you just use the motor!&lt;3
-stickers
-motor isn't very strong

"Loganwan","2008-06-18T02:45:14.92Z","Sticker Shock!","And no, I don't mean the price.  I think this has the most stickers of any set I have built.

This set is amazing.  It is HUGE!  The helicopter looks like it can pretty much pick up anything it wanted, with it's large size and six giant roters.  The copter is very sturdy, and has some fun playability.  It has two big doors for loading and unloading.  The winch works very well, and makes a great sound.  

Three Coast Guard men, and a survivor make a big body count, not to mention a shark, though it would be better if we got one of those new giant sharks like the Agents boat set.

These Coast Guard sets are proving to be a great addition to Lego City.  I am really looking forward to getting my hands on more of these sets, but for now I have to find a place to land this monster.

"jamal_lts","2008-08-20T20:11:04.233Z","GREAT SET","The price for what you'll be getting from this set is astounding. Compared to the tower and the boat, this set is really value for money.

This is by far the best helicopter set compared to the rest of the helicopters Lego has ever released. Its huge and detailed and looks like a real coastal helicopter. 

Power function is also included in this set in a form of a mechanical spring loaded winch. 

The only thing i find poor is the blades which looks flimsy. Its only connected to the main body by a small brown technic connector. And the six blades are just barely held together.

The rest of the body however is sturdy and strong. The wheels are a nice touch looking very proportional to the real thing.

"Emerald_Night","2009-04-04T14:11:00.84Z","Best Coast Guard Set by a Mile","When I first picked up this set I had high expectations. When I finished building it I was astonished. Heres my review broke up into sections.

Raft: The raft has a very good color scheme. The orange really stands out. However, the amount of room in the raft is rather small. However, the minifigure can still fit in. The raft is a easy build but fun.

Helicopter: From my point of view this is one of the best lego helicopters ever produced. The color scheme is fantastic. The blue white and orange mesh perfectly together. This helicopter is also nice because of the doors on either side. When you open these up youll see a nice vast open room with a stretcher. Inside there is also a moterized winch which can be used to rescue the stranded man at sea. The downside about the winch is that it cant lift the life raft which is dissapointing. Also the rope for the winch is very very short. 

I would definetely reccomend this set to city fans. Im thinking of getting another copy of this set just because how great it is. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"toofpikk","2010-12-09T05:21:55.217Z","why isnt the crane working!? help...","<p>emergency! the old mechanic man is stuck inside the life raft and cant escape! his life is at risk because the shark is approaching, but wait, no way! the rescue team have come in the nick of time and... the winch isnt working. well, thats the end of the old mechanic guy.</p>
<p><strong>story!</strong></p>
<p>i had my birthday, and this set wasnt very opular in my local high street and it was on special offer, so guess what? i got it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>everything!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as soon as i got home i was really excited to open the huge box supposedly full of lego and make my first lego helicopter, but as soon as i opened it,my heart sank with the amount of bricks, and as soon as i buit it alot of it collapsed. frst let down is that the life raft doesnt actually float, so if you do try and play with it in the bath, the man is going to die for sure! the builing of the raft is supriseingly easy yet quite complex, but the base is a unique brick which i dont think you can get on any other set. the men are quite cool, but there is not the right amount to make it a proer, epic set. the helicopter is very detailed; there are two control seats, a joystick, a control panel for each flyer and in the back a engined motored winch. the doors are easily miss read, as you need to go over the insturctions a few times before you realise the mistake, which is to put the blue flats on underneath. they work smoothly, but can scrape against the bottom if you dont close it properly which is easily done. the propellers are very .OK. because they work better than most of my other helicopters but they are very very very easily snpped off. and finally, the most important bit of the set, </p>
<p>the winch</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>firstly the string takes about 10 mins to fiddle into the hole and tie it to the spinner in the winch properly. you are supposed to pull it down and then it goes back up, butit doesnt go back up all the way. but, the shark is thumbs up for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so, put some sponge round the side of the life raft, buy more lifegaurd stuff and then buy a different winch, and then, just then, the life raft will fall apart!</p>

"craigpowers","2011-11-15T22:58:22.85Z","The helicopter Lego should have made 20 years ago","<p>As a child and young teenager, Lego sets were my staple choice of toys. &nbsp;I had sets from Castle, Pirate, Space, and Town themes, but the airplane and helicopter sets always had a special place in my collection. &nbsp;However, I always felt that the vehicles were not to proper scale, in that they were too small to be taken seriously (refer to sets 6354 and 6387 for examples of typical Lego helicopters). &nbsp;Now that I am a father and my son is building his own collection, I was more than ecstatic to see this helicopter that boasts a scale that makes almost all other Lego helicopters look like silly R/C models. &nbsp;And the Coast Guard Helicopter isn't just big, but it is a very functional set that has high playability. &nbsp;Plus, its appeal to me, as an adult, allows me to really get involved in playing with my son and helping him to grow his own imagination.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Size. &nbsp;This thing is massive and dwarves all other helicopters made to date. &nbsp;Some collectors may dislike larger sets due to the inability to store or display them in smaller spaces, but this is definitely not a concern for me.</li><li>Color Scheme. &nbsp;Although US Coast Guard helicopters do not employ the orange/blue/white scheme modeled here, what makes this color arrangement so attractive to me is that it has a look unique to itself and no other aircraft and is really eye-catching when placed alongside other sets.</li><li>Construction/Detail. &nbsp;Both the raft and the helicopter were designed with great care and attention to detail. &nbsp;Little space is wasted on either and, especially the raft, pieces are hinged and assembled in a means that surpasses even my imagination and really highlights what wonderful toys Legos are, given their near infinite possibilities. &nbsp;The addition of the ""power winch"" to the helicopter is a significant plus over having to manually re-wind the line. &nbsp;The helicopter's lines and shape borrow heavily from the Sikorsky S-61 Sea King, which was one of my favorite helicopters as a child, hence some of my bias towards the set.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Stickers. &nbsp;I know that Lego will probably never stop making them, so there is little value in complaining, but this set is very heavy on sticker usage - perhaps the most of any set I've ever built - and some of the stickers are hard to place on straight. &nbsp;The raft door stickers, in particular, were a real pain.</li></ul>
<p>I was lucky to snatch this set used off eBay for what was essentially the original new price (it's a hard set to get cheap), and it is definitely one of my all-time favorite City/Town sets. &nbsp;My only wish is that Lego had made this set sometime in the early '90s during my building heyday, because then I would have 20 years of fond memories of playing with it along with all my other sets. &nbsp;I guess I'll just to have make the most of the next two decades to come.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Sobel","2015-12-25T12:24:12.983Z","Great expectations, were a little disappointed","<p>This model appeared to be of many functions, great playability and a real good addition to my collection of LEGO helicopters. Buying LEGO in the pre-christmas-time is always a risk, but I got this one for 20&euro; via EBay.</p>

<p>The overall looks of the model are quite good, it is stream-lined and quite elegant for a chopper this size. The life-raft has a very realistic design to it and you get four minifigs and a shark with the set! The helicopter has a power-functions-winch for thrilling rescue missions. A stretcher is loaded to the helicopter, too, so an injured person can be transported quickly. So the playability of the set is pretty good at all.</p>

<p>Now for some major cons: The build is not very challenging, due to big parts. The whole back of the helicopter is one big chunk of plastic. This could have been designed much better, i.e. buildable for the owner and with some seats or toolboxes odr medkits or at least ANYTHING!. So it&#39;s just a big empty waste of space.<br />
The helicopter has no more features besides the openable hatches (wow...), and the winch. Oh, yeah, OK, you can spin the propellers! Woohoo! You can only access the cockpit and the pilots by dismantling the windshield section. By the way, this is a major flaw to most of the more actual LEGO helicopters...<br />
Also, the rope of the winch is far too short. If the chopper was going to rescue the guy in the life raft, it would sink the whole thing, because it would have to fly some 2-3 meters above it!<br />
And what was a real surprise or me: There was mistake in the parts list in the end of the instructions booklet!! Part number 4504380 is needed 10x, but the list only says 2x! The Ebay-seller relied on the list when he packed the parts, so now I&#39;m missing 8 parts... -.- This is the first time, I found such a mistake in a LEGO instructions booklet!!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite a good design and a great playability, this set really lacks to fulfill my expectations. Though it is large and cool looking, it has way too little functions. If you&#39;re collecting LEGO helicopters, like me, it&#39;s an OK addition, but I would not recommend spending more than 15-20&euro; (17-22$) for it.</p>
