"Lego_Fan","2007-11-23T18:48:05.217Z","Pretty Cool","This set is cool, seeing it's size. My brother got it as a present. It is comprised of a small mining car with a trailer, and an alien with a jet pack.  The car is a cockpit, with a missile and satelite dish on top, plus the sides open to reveal a mini-lab. You can also store a walkie-talkie on the side. The trailer has two small posts to brace it if the car is disconnected, along with a drill and a small chainsaw. Overall, a pretty good set. :)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Hedgehog87","2007-12-19T15:38:58.2Z","Strange Set!","I saw this at a store recently, and bought it. Its is strange set, and the alien has a weird jet pack. I'll get to the pros and cons.

Pros: I like how the alien isn't helpless.
      It has a pretty sturdy design
      It comes with a mini lab!
      It has a cute crystal droid!

Cons: It is somewhat smaller than I thought it would be.
      It's almost defenseless.
      The rocket and satellite fall off easily.

Overall, its a odd set, but not my favorite.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"GSX_R_4S2","2008-02-02T21:08:03.733Z","BUY THIS","This would have to be the greatest cheap set in the history of Lego. Normally I would do a two-in-one review for the alien and human ships, but I'll include it in this one.

Positives

What's not to like? Well, a couple things, but mainly this set is the bomb. The front looks really good (reminds me of that police tank in the World City police station) and the sides match. The satellite and the missile work good with the set, and it even has a place to put a little radio. The lab inside looks great, and it can hold a crystal in it. As for the trailer, the mining arm works great, and the satellite/land pads look perfect. I really like that mini robot on the back that can carry the crystal. Now on to the jetpack. It really fits onto the alien, and it fits the color scheme of the alien ships. It also looks really smooth and stuff, and not clunky like other letpacks Lego has made.

Negatives

Uh...Oh, well the side doors don't cover the lab pieces, so you san see analysis thingies when its meant to be closed. There's a hole in the back that should have been filled with a 2x2x3 brick. Only complaint on the trailer is that the mining arm does not go far enough. And no real complaints on the jetpack.

This is still the all-time best less than 20$ set ever, and probably will be for a while.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

In a 10 dollar set, I expect more than 100 pieces, a 20 dollar set more than 200 and so on. This set is a good value containing a whopping 130 pieces. Then I base it on content. Did it get all those pieces from little connectors or are they actually usable? This set over came my expectations. It includes a nice vehicle and a little drilling unit. SO:
Pros:)
+Great playability
+Drill can fold up for easy storage
+Includes a sweet mars mission man (to bad I already have him)

"Sobel","2020-06-21T21:34:11.227Z","Why can't I give half stars? This one has potential for more, but can't quite do it.","<p>After having finished my first complete series review (check them out, if you like), I have made it some sort of a good routine for myself to review some sets of my collection in my free time. And with that and my deep passion for LEGO Space, I&#39;ll go on to review this space-themed series from the late 2000&#39;s.<br />
Now this set is quite interesting, since it has some functions and good playability, even though being made of few pieces. But there also some negative points which had me swaying between three and four stars. In the review, I&#39;ll show why I went for three in the end.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Simple, standard parts for a vehicle, some bricks and joints, nothing too special. The large orange cockpit is OK, as is the drill. There is an annoying amount of stickers, twelve al in all. This is just too much for such a small set and a HUGE negative point for me. Especially because the stickers all tend to peel of after several years, even though not being played with much.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>An astronaut and an alien are included in this set. The astronaut has a communications device and a buzz saw at his disposal. The ugly green alien makes use of the hole in his body, having a buildable jetpack attached to its body via the hole.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple, brick-on-brick build. First the &quot;truck&quot;, then the &quot;trailer&quot;. Again, the applying all the stickers while building is a huge pain in the... You know where. But it&#39;s still a simple, fast build of approx. 15 minutes max.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Even though having little more parts that the MT-31 Trike, this set comes out smaller than the other. Still, it has clearly more functions. The cockpit can be opened, the hatches to both sides, too. Inside is some kind of mini-laboratory to analyze the crystals. The roof has a communications dish and a single rocket launcher. A mobile comm device is attached to the side of the vehicle.<br />
The trailer has two arms, which can be lowered to serve as some kinds of earth anchor, when the drill is in use. The drill is attached to a small, extendable arm which reaches a little further than the end of the trailer. It can&#39;t be rotated, though. In the back of the trailer, a small robotic vehicle with a single claw arm is attached.&nbsp;<br />
The alien has a buildable jetpack to attack from the sky.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Now, as mentioned in the beginning, I was unsure, wether to give this set 3 or 4 stars. For such a small set, it has quite some functions, as described above. That&#39;s why I gave it a higher rating in playability, for there&#39;s quite some action a kid can have with this set alone. And, of course, it&#39;s a perfect addition to any LEGO Space collection.<br />
But there are quite some flaws, at least IMHO. First up, the stickers. Seriously? Eleven stickers on a set of 130 pieces?!? Ridiculous. Next, the cockpit. No Levers, no monitors, no controls, nothing. Cheap. The single rocket on the roof looks so misplaced, why not just scrap it? The tow coupling between the two parts is WAY too small, the whole vehicle can&#39;t make any sharp turns because the wheels collide with each other. And the drill-arm&nbsp;would have been much better with a mechanism to rotate the whole thing.<br />
So, I would have gone for 3.5 stars for creativity and playability, but since that is not possible, the mentioned flaws pull this set down to 3 stars for me. Still, a nice set for younger kids, but nothing of interest for an AFOL.</p>
