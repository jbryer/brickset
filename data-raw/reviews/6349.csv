"TXPaul","2007-12-01T17:52:53.247Z","Mediocre at Best","I bought this one at TRU in Lewisville, TX today and I was kind of disappointed.  Of course there are way too many stickers, but what really got me was the fact that out of the five yellow pieces in the set, only two of them were the same shade of yellow (the quality of color in production was really poor). The cockpit slides forward and back for no apparent reason and the set just isn't that much fun. However, there are some new pieces that I didn't have in my collection and they really improved the flick fire missles (they no longer fall out when held at an angle).  Overall, I think a three is generous and I should have just bought another MX 71 Recon Dropship for a few dollars more.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Lego_K","2008-01-14T18:57:11.483Z","Lego meets MASK!","My first impression on seeing this set was of the MASK toys from the 80's, where a vehicle would transform into an attack form.

Anyway ...

Design wise in tank form it has a sleek, shell like shape, and the nice white and orange colour scheme works well throughout.
although for a transport/tank it seems a little under armed. In both forms it only has two missles on the sides and two missles/guns on the top (depending how you see them as)

When in fighter mode the rear half of the shell slides back and the chassis swings out to form forward swept wings. Its overall a nice look and fits the overall design of the series.

the cockpit is fully enclosed and the od on the rear has a fastening door to stop its contents falling out, which is a problem earlier sets had.

However the shell part that moves back is not held by anything, so you have to hold it in place yourself. A strange oversight, and one that takes away marks from its score.

It also comes with a handsaw and binoculars for the driver.

Also in the set comes an alien fighter, now for a little vehicle this really has a cool design which looks just like a racer from the F-Zero games. Great design and a great little pack in, I really enjoy how Lego are creating these &quot;battle in a box&quot; packs.

All in all a great set worth the price, with some little problems stopping it from being REALLY great.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Alien ship: 9/10
      I give it a nine out of ten because it could have been better. If you flip it upside down, you will notice two red pieces. Why not black or green? They could have charged $5.00 more if they had made it bigger.

Tank Mode: 10/10
      It is amazing. I dropped it from 3 feet and it took no damage!
It looks terrific.The stickers are crud.

Aircraft mode: 10/10
      It is great. The sliding forward is great. Could have latched on to something. The wings could have latched on to something too. It swooshes through the air very well. Great playability.

Overall 29/30 5*****(stars)

-very solidly built

"Takeshi","2008-08-06T18:56:43.763Z","Great, but not the best.","This is a really nice set, owing to the fact that it can transform from tank to flight modes.

Alien Ship
Pros: Well built for it's size. Makes a nice anti-astro fighter ship.
Cons:...Nothing really


Switch Fighter
Pros: As already stated, it can transform and has improved ff(flick fire) missiles. The top of the ship looks nice as well.
Cons: The bottom was not made as well as it could have been. Looking from the front, you see a lot of blocky areas that don't work well with a flying vehicle.

Summary:
It is a good set, well priced per piece, and has several good pieces. I think that there is definately room for improvement, though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-31T16:39:36.247Z","OK, good set but with some problems","This set is one of the mars mission sets, the current space theme. This is a set that includes two minifigures and two spaceships. The design is like other mars mission sets, good but can be better. The color scheme is basically white, orange and with some blue or black details of the human minifigure and his spaceship, and the green and black colors are characteristiscs of the alien minifigure and spaceship. The human minifigure is nice ad simple, but the alien minifigure is weird, not features much lego likeness and is not playable like the other lego minifigures and the green color is covering all the minifigure, that makes it worst. The human spaceship have no new things and some useful pieces. The building of the ship can be better, due to the wings position, that makes it looks like simple and the capacity to moves the wings looks like to be in a bad place, it not works very well. The base of the ship is good builted but the cockpit, like the wings, is in a bad position, the minifigure don't stay well in it. The human minifigure and space ship are good, i rate these 4/5. But the alien ship is bad builted, the minifigure don't stay well in the cockpit, due to the new form and the ship looks like to be incomplete, because the cockpit is made with some pieces that aren't good to cover completely the minifigure, making the spaceship not looks like so much a spaceship. Altough the building of the cockpit is not the best, some pieces are useful and the color scheme for the spaceship is nice, so, i rate the alien and his spaceship 3/5. Overall, the set have some bad things like the positions of the cockpits, wings and the alien minifigure, but the pieces are useful and the color is good.

"asianlego","2008-10-22T11:47:31.293Z","Coolest Spaceship Ever","I got this set because it looked cool and it was on sale. It seemed like this set was one of the best buys I'd ever made. Unlike the Astro Fighter, the Switch Fighther's cockpit is fully enclosed thanks to the cockpit piece given. There is also a tube where you can store items. The tube fits a removable rack where you are supposed to fit three jewels on it, but it can also used for placing aliens which I did because placing jewels there seemed pointless. The large orange AT barrel wheels are used both as jet engines in flight mode and as wheels in land mode. The alien ship looks quite zany, many transparent pieces are given here! But I wish for the alien ship pilot enclosure, they ended the tusk piece with the proper pointy ending rather than using blood-red fangs. The green flame pieces were nice and a first time I saw it.

But even I rate this set so high, why did I modify it if it was already good on it's own? Because I hated the idea of spaceships with large wheels that can't be kept out of sight like aircrafts do. I retained the the upper part of the spacecraft, taking off the weapons rack because its very unconventional. I combined wings from Crystal Hawk, Astro Fighter and Switch Fighter and the orange gate pieces from Exo-Force Gate Assault to form a large scarab arm wing. Also below the cockpit I added a small area with a glass front from the Street Sweeper as a three-person passenger area (army dropship). At the bottom-back, a swiveling platform is added to fit a Coast Guard quadbike (the color scheme matches Mars Mission) so I could have vehicle transport like the Recon Dropship does.

I suggest that those with other MM sets combine their spaceships together, if you want to see my modification of Switch Fighter pictures would be up soon on my MOCPages. (Link provided at my profile)

I would highly recommend this set to anyone. The set is cheap, functional, nice, and what else could you ask for? Except that they probably should have added more minifigs.

"Sobel","2020-06-24T22:05:53.55Z","Another cool transforming vehicle, one of the better sets of this series!","<p>After having finished my first complete series review (check them out, if you like), I have made it some sort of a good routine for myself to review some sets of my collection in my free time. And with that and my deep passion for LEGO Space, I&#39;ll go on to review this space-themed series from the late 2000&#39;s.<br />
This medium-sized set is rather minimalistic, since it manages to implement one of the coolest functions possible (transformation/convertibility) in a set of only little more than 200 pieces. This makes it one of my favourites of this series.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Apart from standard parts like plates, wings and so on, there are quite some interesting parts to this set. There are some larger parts to form the body, an orange containment unit and a complete cockpit that&#39;s made up of only two pieces. The white main cockpit part was all new to me and I never encountered it again thereafter. The overall white-and-orange colour pattern gives this series a nice look. Four crystals are included, of which three are stored in containment unit. There are some tentacle/fang-parts from the alien vessel that might also be of interest. Oh, and check this out: you have to apply no less than nineteen (19) stickers! Yes, you read right! Nineteen! What the HELL???</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>An astronaut and an alien are included in this set. The Switch Fighter has a small cargo area that holds a chainsaw and some binoculars for the astronaut. The alien has no gear, why should it?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The alien ship is built first, followed by the Fighter. This ship consists of three main stages, which are built individually. First stage is the cockpit and the base of the ship. Next up is the armour with the containment unit and the torpedoes on the roof. The last part is the lower portion of the fighter with the foldable wings and the wheels. Each stage is attached to the previous one after finishing it. The build is not too difficult, just be careful to build the internal structure correctly, since this is critical for the main function of the model.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Switch Fighter has two forms: tank and jet.<br />
In tank form, it is a bulky, six-wheeled vehicle with hints of a stream-lined design needed for aerial manoeuvres. It has two flip-torpedoes on the roof and a single rocket launcher to each side. The cockpit can be opened. In the back is the standard orange containment unit. This one has a sticker for an alien prison cell on it, yet, it holds a cargo pod with three crystals. Other than the containment unit of the MT-31, this one has a black TECHNIC connector-like part to secure the cargo.<br />
To transform to jet mode, you have to take hold of the cockpit and the containment unit and pull in the opposite directions. Then you have to pull the two forward facing sides of the &quot;chassis&quot; to the left and right to unclick the wings. After they are fully extended, the back of the ship can be pulled back even further, so it reaches its full length.<br />
The small alien fighter has two tiltable blaster turrets and the cockpit can be opened.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I simply love sets with transform-functions. And, as mentioned in the introduction, it is even more astounding that this set has such a cool function with very limited pieces! The mechanism turns a rather heavy-handed, bulky ground vehicle into an aerodynamic, slender jet, that also serves as a high-speed transport. The simplicity of the click-and-fold-mechanism is really convincing and begs to be reproduced in bigger scale (MOC)! The containment unit has a lock of sorts this time, what makes real sense, since a special transport like this is somewhat useless when the cargo drops out halfway to the destination... The alien fighter, even though being so small, looks very powerful and determined to do one thing: destroy at all costs.<br />
One HUGE negative point for me are, once again, the stickers. I mean, seriously? Nineteen stickers? There&#39;re sets with far more than 1,000 pieces that do not have that many stickers!! Another point, also once again, is the cockpit. Oh, look, they gave the pilot a handlebar to steer! Unfortunately, he can&#39;t reach it whatsoever... Why not use 2x1 tiles with printed controls on it...? And one last negative point is the armament. This ship is described as &quot;fighter&quot;, but it does not have a single blaster? Only two torpedoes and two rockets? That&#39;s lame. IF you consider, what is written on two of the stickers (&quot;Surface to air transport&quot;) it makes more sense. But, well, the details...<br />
All in all, a cool set, excellent addition for any LEGO space collection and a big plus for the whole series.</p>
