"AddictedToStyrene","2008-01-11T09:43:41.903Z","Two shades of pink","This is a really good small, basic set. It comes in a pink tub, which is probably big enough for a small Lego collection, maybe four or five sets. There is a surprising variety of bits in the tub: 
- light pink bricks
- dark pink bricks and slopes
- all sorts of bricks and plates in white, red, yellow, orange, blue, brown and two shades of green
- two wide and four wide axles in black, small, narrow wheels in white with black tyres
- a big white door frame and yellow door
- a clear wineglass 
- a yellow-orange icecream piece
- some big flowers 
- white 2x2 blocks with eyes.

There are no minifigs in this set, but there are a lot more bricks, slopes and odd pieces than you would expect. Not many plates unfortunately, but it is still a very good variety set and a good one for young girls, or anyone who wants some more colour!

"jof","2009-03-29T08:21:05.233Z","No proper minifig, so only a 3.","I got this for my youngest daughter so she would have her own pink lego & stop taking parts from her older siblings.

Good collection of parts in interesting colours.

However there appears to be a problem in the pink colouring.  Instead of a standard dark pink, we seem to get 2 different dark pinks.  (Never had this problem with older daughters belville sets)  Seems like bley all over again.

The 'skipping rope' appears popular.

They could have made this load better by adding 2 female minifigs (there are no where near enough girl minifigs made).  The reasoning behind this is that there are quite a few small parts in this set so you wouldn't be aiming it at 3+ age groups (where you could get away with blocky people like you get in set 2229-1

"AlterBrick__Vienna__Austria","2009-07-26T10:25:05.483Z","You get some colors, but could be more & better assorted","Pros:
8 magenta slopes 45 2x4
Many bright pink bricks, but too many 2 wide, only few 1 wide bricks.

Else: Some lime & orange etc. to complement your collection.

Cons:
Dark pink looks great, but very little content - just 8 2x2, 2 1x1 and two slopes 45 2x1.
Magenta slopes would need also smaller parts than just 2x4s.
Only 4 1x2 magenta bricks - not more of this rare but interesting, strong & happy color.

Would be an interesting ""alternative colors brick set"", but it brings too little. In German we say ""1 dog from each village"" - that is not too satisfying.

Also as a gift for a child: Maybe in connection with the new 5560 but again there: only 10 2x4 slopes in magenta - no smaller ones no more other magenta bricks. At least some extra dark pink . . . but let's see as soon as I have it.

If this is for girls, they have a really hard start into LEGO ;-)

For AFOLs: At least there is some way to continue the ""paradisa""-look, which is just cute in my mind (MAN!). It looks happy.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"emma2","2011-02-27T14:05:38.917Z"," the pink brick box","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the pink brick box is awsome. I think that because it comes with 216 pieces and you can make all different things with it. The only bad thing about it is that it comes with lego people that are made out of the legos that come with it. If i were you i would rate the pink brick box as&nbsp;a&nbsp;four.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4
"AETerry","2011-12-31T18:22:56.99Z","Pink Brick Box Review","<p>I got this for my daughter for Christmas this year (2011) as I know she loves the color pink. She's accepted it well enough, though she's spent more time with a larger brick box I got her, she just hasn't mixed them all together yet for some odd reason.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Like all of LEGO's plastic bucket sets that follow a color theme, there's a larger box and then a smaller box. 5560 Pink Bucket is larger than 5585 Pink Bucket that I'm reviewing here. And they make for good storage bins for children who don't have a lot of LEGO bricks or are just starting out their collections.</p><p>There's also a set of instructions or idea book to help guide a child along on ideas for models they can build if they want to make some of the models shown on the box.<br></p><p></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>There's 216 pieces with this bucket with a fairly decent color variety, most of which are variations of the color pink. Light Pink, Dark Pink and a Fuchsia color for the roof tiles. The variety for types of pieces isn't as great as a larger brick bucket, but still decent.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are no minifigures with the small bucket, which seems to hold true for any of the small bucket sets that come in at $19.99 for price. There are printed bricks so figures can be made.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>While there are instructions, a bucket set like this is meant for a lot of free form building to engage a child's imagination, so there really isn't any completed or final build.<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>Obviously LEGO is thinking of young girls with a Brick Bucket like this and it works too when you have a daughter like mine who loves pink. It's not a bad way to get a goodly number of pieces, especially pink for any specific models or MOCs in mind. With having gotten the larger Pink Bucket 5560 first, this one has a bit of an anti climatic feel. <br></p><p>I'd still get the pink bucket for my daughter though as she has asked for it at various times when we'd go down the LEGO aisle in a store. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
