"Arkahn","2008-02-10T22:15:14.327Z","Okay...","Mutran and vican is not one of my favourite sets, and the green isnt so forthecoming on mutran, making him look mostly black.

Pros:
2 black bat wings
1 matoran bat wing
2 masks(luck of the draw for amount of green)
shadow leeches

cons:
same as normal makuta, plus a matoran.

Hope that this helps someone.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-07T14:17:07.5Z","Mad scientist and his assistant","Vican was a matoran, and looks like different of one, liking more a shadow or light matoran of 08'. With the same head, a don't compatible with toa bodies, and arms and legs, have little differences on the feet, one onua's claw in each leg, and weapons, the inika nuparu's claws. The colors are silver, black and lime green, same of his master, mutran. This, a makuta looks like chirox, but more tall, and with different parts, like his fingers and the easy to make weapon, with two blades. The other is named shadow sword, but is also used in some, changing the name. On the torso, he features a tridax pod, things that carries the shadow leeches, other forms of the kraata. It can be launched pushing on his body's back. They aren't connected with chains, like vezon and fenrakk or maxilos and spinax, but they can team up.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Aleiobot","2008-12-28T20:52:01.78Z","Got to be the best Phantoka!","Mutran and Vican are most likely the best Phantoka out there! I've really had only three problems with them, the head bobbling feature on Mutran, the way he holds his spear, and getting Vican to stand up. Other than these few, minor problems, this set is well worth the price and effort to get it.! Both figures are extremely awesome and wicked cool, with cool features. Besides Toa Ignika, Mutran and Vican are probably my favorites from the first half of 2008. If you're collecting 2008 Bionicles (like I am) (or any collection for that matter), you've definetly got to get this set before they're gone!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"freakish1987","2008-04-23T03:14:08.747Z","Vican is better off demolished","Vican is extra. After I finished building the set, I demolished Vican. LOL. Totally pointless in having Vican, I used vican's parts to modify my other bionicles. 

Mutran is better. however, I prefered to pose Mutran in a flying position, because he have wings. To me, making him stand won't look as nice as flying horizontally. Mutran's neck is loose and even shakes. 

Pros:
Nice colours(only thing that I can think of)
Nice packaging :)

cons:
can't stand properly,
Standing position looks very 2 dimensional. make it fly instead.
Mutran's head is limited in moving

Pros: (Mutran)

cool mask
claws
cool staff

cons:
none

secondly I will review Vican

"Carl","2009-10-14T03:59:12.623Z","Mad scientist and even madder little green friend (no hes not Yoda)","I built Vican first because hes the smaller guy out of the two and overall I was pleased. His feet are cool and I can't remember where his hands originated but they're cool anyway. I like green so that was extra points. But the disapointments were the wings -like the other Makuta Matoran- because they kinda stick out a bit too far and the reusage of Kirop's mask. However they recoloured it, so it's not too bad.

Next I built Mutran because he would obviously be better and I believe in saving the best till last. I find him a really unique Bionicle because not many Bionicles have two different weapons. Personally, I like the staff more than the sword, but that's just my opinion. I really like the use of the Mantax claws as talons and they make him look menacing even without the staff and sword. The mask, once again, is reused -courtesy of Chirox- but again they changed the colour, so again it's not that bad. The wings are great and the leech sac* is cool. But like I said in my Chirox review -I dunno if you read it, but I gave Chirox a 5/5- it does not always smash and spill the leeches. Apart from that he's awesome.

Overall, this is a really great set and I recommend it to every Bionicle collector.

Vican
unique. He has little difference from kirop. Yet those stand out like his feet. For a start he has a different connecting piece and then it's the fact he has claws, not blades.Interesting.

Mutran
cool.Awsome wings and blades but apart from that he is not too different from other mukuta I love his blade,similar to toa ignika.His claws are another awsome feature.In short,a green chirox.

Very good set considering one of the two has a dropped price tag,cheaper than a matoran and toa/mukuta.A real bargain.

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the fact that both builds are slightly more complex versions of the pre-existing Matoran and Makuta sets from the early half of 2008, or if I just love lime green, but I&#39;d highly recommend this set, since you get two figures for $15; only $2 more than a normal canister set from &#39;08.</p>
