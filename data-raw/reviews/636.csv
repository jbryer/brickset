Have more recent Space theme series but this little dude fits in well he is special and is in charge of some of the other men on missions. Nice set, I'm sure its hard to find now because it was released 17 years ago.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This is a nice little craft with folding wings and a good selection of pieces.  The set is presumbly a special release of some kind.  The colour scheme suggests it's somewhere between Blacktron 1 and Blacktron 2.  Still, nice to see they've retained the (far superior) Blacktron 1 minifig.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Although it still has the minifig from blacktron one, it also has blacktron two colors. Unfortunatly, this makes it blend in with neither theme and kinda ruins it. It's still a nice craft and the red pieces are always good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2011-01-30T11:02:52.947Z","Decent Set","<p>Like many of my older space sets, I got this one simply by looking through spare parts that I had gradually accumulated over time. Thanks to peeron I soon had the a nice, small little set assembled before me.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Unfortunately, I have neither the box nor the instructions, due to the means in which I acquired the set. <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>&nbsp;There are few parts in this set, and all but five are either black or white. As previously stated, that means that the Meteor Monitor fits more into the color scheme of Blacktron II than Blacktron I. Most of the pieces are nothing really special, although I'm sure the wings are useful for any MOCist.<br><br><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set comes with the standard Blacktron I minifig, which you can never have enough of if you are a space fan. He is actually a fairly cool little guy, and I can just imagine that in the lego space universe the mere sight of him frightens the little space civilians to no end. His smiley face kind of takes away the evilness from him, but that's okay, because his face is hidden behind his helmet, adding a little mysteriousness to our little guy.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fairly simple, and shouldn't take more than a few minutes. There's nothing special about the build, and in a very short amount of time you have a little scout ship for your Blacktron forces. This gives your Blacktron guys a quick little vehicle that can monitor meteors, attack civilians, steal cows, or whatever it is that this ship was designed to do.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When it's all done and over with, you have the set sitting in front of you. And, if you're like me, the first thing you do is start playing with the wings, putting them at different angles to see what looks best. Unfortunately, that's really all that this set can do. Unless you have other space sets (Not necessarily other Blacktron sets, our evil little guy can terrorize pretty much anybody if you want him to) there isn't really much you can do with him, aside from having him attack you lego city/castle/farm.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, definitely a nice little set. I would suggest that if you decide to get this set that you buy the parts individually. Most likely much cheaper than trying to buy the set itself on ebay. <br></p><p>Nice little set, but not much that can be done with it. 3.5/5</p><p><br></p><p>Eerex<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,3
