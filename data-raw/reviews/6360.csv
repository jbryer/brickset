The only draw back is the snake oiler, It has a lot of stickers across the front 13 of them. I t take some time to get them right. Both cars have the same windshield and fenders. Set was only 20.00 bucks and they had set 8159 so I got them both plus KMart had a sale of buy two get third free. I cant wait for the track and the Truck sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LuvKernow","2008-04-05T06:00:25.717Z","Rubbish tie-in to a rubbish movie...","These sets are abysmal, Lego have really taken way too many short-cuts on these. The interiors are bland (no gearsticks, too far from steering wheel, etc...), the M sticker on the front goes across five, yes FIVE, bricks, and generally I think the set probably is around 30-50 pieces short of making it a very good set.

Ah well, the fenders are now being incorporated as part of a window frame on some of my houses, the windshield is now on my updated land-speeder and the plates are also useful!

"legofanatic","2009-01-31T07:16:58.14Z","Could be better.","This set is pretty cool although it could be a lot better. Here are the pros and cons for the Mach 5:

Pros: Paint job is just like the movie or cartoon
        Cool windshield
        Finally a two seated car
        They did Speed really well

Cons: No saw or any of the other gadgets
         They could of at least made the trunk to where you can open it
         Its not smooth enough if you know what I mean

Snake oilers car:

Pros: Very detailed 
         Cool pieces
         Snake Oiler is really cool

Cons: Again no gadgets
         Again not smooth enough
         They could have at least given a snake with the set

All together its a good set no matter what. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the movie or the cartoon.

"Gus_263","2008-05-22T10:00:26.263Z","Cool cars, have much innovations","This set is one of the speed racer sets, and like the set 8159, this includes two cars. The cars, unlike some other lego cars, are big and have a good space to two minifigures inside. The building inside the snake oiler and match 5 are common, but the both have notable differences in the building, color schemes, of course and design of the chassis. The set have also two minifigures, the &quot;speed racer&quot; and &quot;snake oiler&quot;. The two are well detailed and designed, the details aren't much in the speed racer's blue shirt, but the both minifigures are good additions, and have helmets for pilots. Altough these two minifigures have the skin color on the hands and faces, it isn't a problem, but it is to make the minifigures more accurate with the movie. Overall the minifigures are cool.

The Match 5 is maybe one of the better Lego cars ever made, in design and specially in the building, it isn't made by system pieces at all, have two technic sticks to connect the wheels and make the suspensions. The space to the minifigures in the Match 5 is decent, have two chairs and two can seat very well on it. The back is increased by plates with different shapes, and all these have the white color scheme. Altough the scheme is monotone, it is accurate with the movie and the stickers changes the color schemes. Altough the stickers are sometimes problems to the building and to make creations, the pieces of the sides are different in shapes, making the printed details a bad option to use more color schemes. If you don't like stickers in this car, don't use, but the white color will make this set monotone in the design and it won't show much accuracy with the original. 

Some different bricks are increasing the front, and the wheels have a good space to roll easily, some plates make the aerodinamic on each side, but some pieces make the aerodinamic not much accurate on the front. The flashlights are only two small shapes on each side of the front, but these makes a decent accurate with the original, because the flashlights of the original Match 5 aren't big. The wheels are different in the shapes in comparison with the wheels of the cars released in the city theme, but still useful, only features a different connection with the technic sticks, and a silver color, but not much cleared.

The snake oiler car isn't much different inside and on the back, have also a size like the Match 5, but the front features some different shapes, and more semicircular bricks. This car is too well made and is really playable, but it features a lot of stickers, so much more than the Match 5. Altough it looks like with the Match 5 in the building of the back and of the cockpit, the backspoiler is a notable difference, good in the aerodinamic and accurate with the original. The flashlights are also small, but cool and again, have a decent accurate with the original. The wheels are also the same of the Match 5, and the connections are well positioned, too made by technic sticks.

Overall, the two cars are well made, playable, designed and have decent accuracy with the original. But some stickers and special pieces, in a try to make it more accurate, made it with some odd things on the design and building. But it is a good option to get two cool cars, with some innovations in the building. The current price is good, but if you get this by few minus, it will be better, I think this is a good price yet. Overall, regarding this as a medium sized set, this set gets 4,6 of 5, due to the lot of stickers and some special pieces, like the semicircular bricks. But it still a good way to get the speed racer and snake oiler minifigures, good to any Lego and also speed racer fan. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-04-12T14:04:02.763Z","Two Seaters Finally!","It is great to have a few two seater cars around.  It is kind of funny since I just got the cargo truck set 7733, and these cars are just as wide.  I am not a huge fan of stickers, but they are really nicely designed.  I only wish the center part of the 'M' did not go over three pieces.  It would  be nice to be able to break these parts down like all of the parts on the Snake Oiler.  The only other thing I would have changed is the helmets.  It would have been nice to have helmet that 1. did not have the chin protector, and 2. had a clear visor.  These are open top cars, and I don't think these guys would be stupid enough to run without some eye protection (with the exception of Snake Oiler's sunglasses and Racer X's visor.  Okay, so it is just Speed Racer and Taejo Togokahn who need to get a visor.

This set does make me want to get the more expensive Race Track set just so I can see how the Mach 6 looks. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lotographia","2009-02-09T21:34:35.187Z","Why stickers why???","I don't mind stickers so much, I like to apply them to 'complete' the model and people don't have to use them if they don't want to, but I get quite annoyed when they design stickers to go across two or more bricks because it means you can't fully disassemble the model without cutting the sticker apart. And that to me seems like destroying the product. So one star down for that.

There are two things I really like about this set - the fact that each car has two seats when Lego only really needed to give them a driver seat, and the bar that goes between the wheels. Why do I like the bar? Because you can make the cars drive on two wheels and the opposite wheels will keep spinning, which gives a nice touch of realism.

Another thing I like about these cars and the other two cars is that they all have distinct designs - it would have been easy for Lego just to design on generic Speed Racer car and give it four different colors. This way, each car has its own personality.

So, apart from the annoying two-brick sticker, these are some well-designed cars with some nice features.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
