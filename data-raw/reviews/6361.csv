Although the cars feature no hidden gadgets like in the show, this allowed Lego to make them look fantastic instead, and in this regard they acheived it. A lot.

I have always liked the colour combination of yellow and black, so Racer X's car stood out to me. Easily my favourite of the Speed Racer series so far, Racer X's car has a low, wide and sleek profile matching the whole Speed Racer theme nicely. It has a protruding engine block visible behind the drivers seat and metallic rims for extra good looks. Be careful with the stickers on the cars hood, don't leave yellow lines! see the box's front image for help on how it should look.

Taejo's car has a striking red and black scheme, and a LOT of stickers. However this is also its strength. When finished view the car from above, you'll see a dragon motif emblazened on the car. Very stylish!

Both cars can have a driver and a passenger much like the adventurers and Indiana Jones cars. These seem to have a bit more room though probably due to their wider forms.

Although the cars are missing some sort of gadget, and I would have liked to have seen some trackside element or maybe a small pit stop, overall this set is just great fun. new pieces, fantastic designs and the best lego cars ever.

HIGHLY recommended.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"David1971","2008-07-20T17:25:55.53Z","Very nice, cool cars, good value","This is great for &#163;12.99 (UK). You get two cars and two minifigs. The cool cars show up most other Lego vehicles in an interesting way: I had never previously been bothered that Lego cars are normally only one person wide ... but once you've seen these excellent two-seater cars you think, oh yes, *this* is how they should be!

It's possible that the scale of these cars has gone too far the other way - compared to the height of a minifig, these cars are absolutely massive (being at least the length of five people lying down, head to toe). But let's not worry about that.

The yellow car is clearly the nicest one here - it looks great even without the stickers and has very neat wheel covers. (The red one doesn't have those, for some reason, and the wheels look rather bare by comparison). The red car looks a bit less cool but is still fine and it's nice that it has seats! The minifigs both have interesting designs and I'm sure those bodies will have other uses.

A very good set, and you get a lot for your money.

"lotographia","2009-02-03T22:31:57.233Z","Only one problem.","If you want the Racer X car, this is the way to go - Cruncher Block's truck appears to have had very little thought put into it. Re-using the same car twice? No removable cover for the trailer? No hats for the minifigs? It's like that set was a last-minute addition.

If you're a fan of the movie, these are great little models of two of the cars. You can even fit two minifigs in each car, which is quite neat considering they only come with one passenger each. A nice thought from the lego company, since the traditional lego car can only fit one driver anyway.

I also appreciate the way both cars have distinctive designs, since it would have been very easy for the Lego company to design one generic 'Speed Racer' car and build it in two different colours. There's very little cross-over between these cars.

Lots of stickers for sticker fans, some cool designs on the minifigs, a good mixture of generic and specialised parts.

The only problem with this set is the number nine sticker on X's car that goes across two bricks. Why does the Lego company do this? You either have to cut the sticker up, which seems like ruining the product, or leaving the two bricks stuck together, which somewhat defeats the purpose of lego.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Both cars are as big as my hands and the red race car for Taejo Togokhan has a lot of stickers. Even if you don't like stickers I think that these vehicles needs them because these make the cars cooler. Togokhan's car has 2 seats so you can put in two minifigs in total. Racer X's yellow car has two seats as well and some nice headlights in the front. This vehicle doesn't have not so many stickers but a very nice look. On the back you can see a nice v6 engine. The windscreen pieces appeared in this set. If I had to pick up my favourite vehicle I would choose the red vehicle from Taejo Togokhan. These're two awsome cars and I really like this set because you get 2 vehicles in one set. <br></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Positive:</span><br><br>Great pieces which you can use for brickfilms or MOC's<br>Minifigs<br>Attractive cars<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Negative:</span><br><br>This set has stickers<br><br><br>All
