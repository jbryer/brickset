Being a truck fan I couldn't miss it. Also, having two same Racer X in two different sets (see set 8159) is a little disspointing for completists who do not want doubles.

Racer X:
The minifig looks great. All black, with helmet and a clear black visor with white X over his torso and helmet. Certainly striking. His racecar is a striking black and yellow beauty with great curves and a decent engine up back. The new windshield and mag pieces are nice, although there are a lot of shortcuts in the build and also a pretty bare interior. Decals are here so be warned. Not much playability. Just the wheels roll and the minifig. Overall though it's a great model.

Cruncher Block:
First and foremost all three minifigs (Cruncher Block, (female)  Driver and Taejo (in non racing &quot;damaged shirt&quot; gear) included have &quot;bare&quot; heads. No hair pieces. Just some printed on &quot;fringe/bangs&quot; on the top of the head. Which is surely dissapointing. As for the vehicle itself. It's a mixed bag. The actual cab is large and chunky and fits it's Cruncher name. It certainly looks formidable. The interior is a little small with room for two minifigs and the steering and gear stick is a little high (blocks minifigs vision!) The cabs roof flips open (via technic pegs) for access to the spring loaded gun trigger. Alternatively the back of the cab is open for you to rech the trigger. The actual rubber &quot;missile&quot; is just behind the front grill. The grill can be lifted via a hinge or just launch the missle and it's potency is enough to swing the grill open and launch the missile a good distance. The side mirrors swing on two axis points. That's it for playability. Overall it's a decent truck design. The trailer is altogether a different story. Besides the four frames on each corner and three &quot;wall&quot; areas, thats it for the trailer. It's open. and looks really silly. A huge dissapointment considering for the rpice point a hinged wall should have been provided. Inside the actual trailer is two decaled computers three painting decals a nice aquarium, swivelling chair and a small turret under the trailer that can be moved using the lever in between the two computers. The trailer connects via a technic crossbar that slots into a technic piece in the cab. The trailer is overall a disappointing waste of good potential. It is very bare and  should have had more features/gimmicks.

PRO's:
- Great Truck Cab and Racer X's racecar
- Racer X minifig
- alternative Taejo minifig

CON's:
- Trailer
- overpriced
- small playablity
- the same Racer X vehicle &amp; minifig in two separate sets

Overall, the Trailer is a huge let down. Considering the pricepoint ($60 Australian) and peices available, I'm sure they could have made the trailer either with walls or mroe play features. Truck lovers shoudl still get it for the great cab and perhaps mod the trailer if you have the resources.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
