This set is awesome I managed to snag this set at toysrus today and put it together in an hour and it is so detailed and cool. The only things that I don't like is the Mach 6 front isn't completely covered, the gray ghost car has darker gray stickers not the bluish that they look like on the box, and there are no helmet visors ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-05-05T14:29:39.09Z","AWESOME!","This set is fantastic.  There are so many pieces, and the cars are great.  The only problem that I have with the set is the fit of Grey Ghost and Cannonball.  They do not fit into their cars well. I think it is due to the change for the big race cars, making them into single seaters.  They wanted to have a Formula 1 Look to them, but Lego forgot to leave room for the arms.  

The cars are well designed, and go together just like the other SR sets.  The race stand is great, with fun sponsorship, and 8 minifigs.  That is a lot of different characters.


This is definitely the set to beat.  I would love to see this continue and see  some of the other cars from the big race.  If the movie is half as good as the Legos, then there will be some good times at the theater.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"orukaia","2008-05-31T00:13:20.67Z","Amazing fun!","I got this set at Smith's Marketplace cuz there was a buy 1 get 1 free sale and I got the Mobile Command center free (the police one). I was pleasantly surprised when I got into the building process. The cars are very fun to build, although the base designs are similar so it gets kind of repetitive. The cars are really great and fun to play with!

Speed Racer's Car- Great design, although it would've been cool if it had a windshield. The stickers add a great effect, but the ones on the side prong-ish thing are kind of hard to see. The body design is very similar to the movie design, which is cool, but there are a lot of gaps and unnecessary edges/ridges.
     8.5/10
Grey Ghost's Car- This is an awesome design! It's looks really great and is fun to play with and looks awesome on display. It has a very cool, sleek design and looks just like the movie version. But one HUGE problem! There are about 25 stickers to put on this car alone! It got super frustrating! But once you have the stickers on, it looks totally awesome! 9.5/10

Cannonball Taylor's Car- This car has a pretty great design. The gold engine in the back looks way cool and I love the arches that go around the outside of the wheels. This car was probably my favorite to build, and it looks way great when it's done!
     8.5/10

The Commentator’s booth/stand thing- Pretty good design, although not entirely necessary, and there’s one thing that bugs me. Each of the two commentator’s booths have three screens, making six total, but they all have the same image on them (the same one on the jumbo TV)
-If you turn the Commentator’s stand around, it becomes the Racer Motors repair station. It’s a cool little add-on; it has a couple extra tires, a car jack, two tool carrier carts, Racer Motors signs, and cool stickers on the walls that have all sorts of tools on them.
	7/10

The Jumbo T.V. and Advertisement poles- The T.V. is kind of cool, but it has the same image as the six screens in the commentator’s booths. Not much to say about it. 6/10
The advertisement poles are very boring and should have been left out of the set- 4/10

Minifigs- All 3 of the racers (Speed, Cannonball Taylor, Grey Ghost) have awesome racing suits, but could use visors on their helmets (not hard to add :P)
Spritle and Pops- these two are pretty movie accurate, but pretty boring
Trixie- The single most hideous mini-fig I’ve ever seen, but definitely not a reason to refrain from buying the set XD
Chim-Chim- A cool little monkey, not much to him, but he’s awesome nonetheless =)

Overall, this set is totally awesome and I would definitely recommend getting it. Even if your not a Speed Racer fan, this set provides great building and hours of fun. 
Overall score- 9.5/10

Pros: 
Minifigs are unique and in light flesh color not yellow - with funny prints on ""Monkey Boy's"" body or ""Lady Pink Dress""

3 Cars are excellent builds partly with brick-built color-patterns - they do not need one single sticker - the best is grey one

The building is fine - built of few bricks - ""racey"" design - seats & screens for commentators excellent

Good parts for many purposes as loads of wedge-plates and curved slopes which are still rare or 4 2x2x10 girders, 5 2x4x5 white stanchions as well as 4 black arches and a lot of black and white 1x2 tiles for interesting patterns e.g. etc.

Workshop utilities look good and expand the huge playability as well as the monkey

Cons:
Many stickers, but you need only some of them e.g. for the big screen - my cars remain sticker-free!

Well - either the cars are kind of huge or or the minifigs are kind a minimini - but who cares, if one has to race a race with three fantastic cars and only two hands?

;-)

Finally: I bought it on Ebay for only 30 Euro => excellent piece/Euro-ratio - I was surprised by the quality of this set, that I never saw @ Legoshop, Amazon or elsewhere - it is a hidden treasure - clear 5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Nightwing20","2013-06-29T15:18:41.463Z","""He's gonna do it...""","<p>I got this set second hand off of EBay with a few other sets for a great price but I would be more  than ready to pay the full RRP for this! It contains 3 Beautiful cars and some great accessories! Here are my opinion of the models and minifigures:</p><p>Speed Racer: Nice torso and I like the accurate printing on his helmet. His head reminds me of some of the beautiful heads made by minifig designer Sakuretsu. It would be nice to see some back printing though.</p><p>Trixie: Good figure. The back looks a bit strange, but the head is good and the torso and leg combination is cool.</p><p>Pops: Looks a bit strange! Nice figure anyway. Torso would be good for a football player.</p><p>Spritle: Could be better, but the detail is good and the head is good for other figures.</p><p>Grey Ghost: Looks not much like his  movie counterpart, but good figure still. </p><p>Cannonball Taylor: Great head, good detail.</p><p>Commentator: Torso would be good for a WWE commentator. Nice figure.</p><p>Cars: The Mach 6 could be a bit better, but good still. The other 2 are great but fragile and the half-rings around the wheels on Cannonball Taylor's car should be yellow.</p><p>Advertising poles and screen: Nice accessories. Great for any fan. The image on the screen should be different though.</p><p>Grand Prix building: Good model. A bit flimsy and hard to put together but still fun.</p><p>Accessories: Great additions!</p><p>Overall I would say this set is great and playable and would give it a 9/10 (Nothing's perfect :P)</p><p>It really is a must-have!!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
