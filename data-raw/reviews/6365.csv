The assembly process was quite tedious, but the end results are really quite amazing.  The wheel is fully functional, and watching it roll along is an awesome sight.  I cannot wait for the rest of the dwarf/orc sets to be released.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"merkalK","2008-05-03T16:02:57.67Z","Best castle vehircle ever!","This is the best castle land vehicle in the Castle line 30 years. It's a break from the seemingly endless variations on the catapult. 

The huge wheels rip through the knights army without difficulty it probably mow down trees and can cross moats and ditches if the orcs survive of course what brings me to the battle wheel's weakness. The orcs have no protection or armor and can be taken out with a well aimed arrow. Along with Tower Raid and Troll Assault Wagon I think the Orcs can take it up against anything that is thrown at them.

"greenfrog_7","2008-05-09T02:28:29.17Z","Troll Battle Wheel... we'll see how great it is...","It's great! This is one of the best sets of the new Castle sets. Aside from some tedious moments assembling the wheel sections (twice!) this set is amazing. It looks great, generates great interest from display, an excellent assortment of figures and accessories that are all fun to play with, and of course, the wheel rolls. The firing mechanism is great and there are not enough good things I can say about this set. Buy it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lint","2009-07-18T01:14:34.81Z","A very Troll-like set","I picked this up for about half price from TRU. It was a must get because a set with so much character cannot be passed by.

PROS
-Oozing with troll character
-Fun to play with
-Six minifigs
-A LOT of pieces
-Many interesting construction pieces I have never come across before
-battle wheel very sturdy and solid
-human barricade is surprisingly impressive too
-You get a double faced 'scared' human minifig
-The grappling chain is cute
-trigger cannon is VERY powerful
-Easily disassembled into segments for storage

CONS
-The full retail RRP is over the top.
-Troll captains helmet doesnt actually fit on tightly because of the skeleton armour.
-The two runner trolls dont come with personal weapons or shields (unless you want to use the long halberds from the battle wheel)
-The human minifigs are a bit bland. 

I wouldn't have minded if they got rid of the humans completely and jazzed up the battle wheel a bit more.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"CrzyLCF","2009-06-25T14:02:23.687Z","Time to rampage!","This is a fabulous set. Although the building process may be boring, the end results are absolutely phenomenal! It comes with an excellent troll battle wheel which I will mention later on in this review, a neat little fort for the knights even though they will get easily rampaged by the battle wheel, plenty of weapons (6 spears, 2 swords, 4 halberds, crossbow and bronze scimitar), 1 shield, a troll captain with skeleton armor and a bronze helmet, 2 troll warriors, a knight general and 2 peasant knights. Time to go into more details.<br><br>The Troll Battle Wheel is spectacular. But the building of the two gigantic wheels is really boring as you have to build 16 planks on each wheel which totals to 32. Building one wheel took me about a half hour. Once you are done building the two wheels you have to add 32 silver edged teeth onto each plank! But once you've finished building the wheels, the end result looks superb. The wheels roll nice and smoothly and it can rampage through anything. At the back of the two wheels there is a big long stick which allows you to control the battle wheel. Just under the stick, there is a trigger which you can pull back and release a huge missile straight into the heart of the knights! But the trigger is really sensitive so you have to watch out when you carry the vehicle because once the missile shot right into my dog's eye and he wasn't at all pleased with me... Just above each wheel, there is a troll warrior clinging onto a halberd that is sticking out from the middle of the battle wheel and they make the wheels move, although it looks like they are moving it backwards but that's not a problem. In the middle there is the troll captain who just sits there and does nothing. Just under him there is a troll banner. Some people were complaining that the troll warriors don't come with enough weapons when you can pluck out the two halberds from the sides and take out the crossbow.<br><br>The knight's fort is nice and simple with 3 spears on each side and a catapult with a rear silver ball smack in the middle. The catapult doesn't shoot that far which is a bit disappointing. I'd like the knight's fort to be a bit bigger as there isn't much room to put on all of them. One of the knights comes with a hook attached to a chain which allows him to grab on to one of the halberds on the troll battle wheel which I thought was pretty cool.<br><br>Overall, this set is pretty remarkable but building it isn't. But it's something worth buying! <br>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"djfooboo","2009-08-18T22:50:15.64Z","A fresh face to the Castle lineup","When I saw this on sale I had to buy it..  The look on the face of the knight about to get squished is priceless.

Pros:
6 Minifigs and tons of weapons
Rolls well considering it isn't technically round (its a hexadecagon)
Spikes on wheel
Barricade is adjustable for whatever angle you need 
Missile launcher
No stickers
You can't see in the picture, but there is a handle protruding out the back to roll it 

Cons:
Repetitive Build
Troll minifigs rolling the wheels hard to position
Armor and helmet interference
Barricade quite small

This set will probably be my gateway to buying more Castle sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"yorgerg5","2010-08-11T09:55:31.393Z","A great starter set","If your getting into lego castle then this is the first set you should be trying to buy. The battle wheel is a powerful weapon and you get 6 minifigures! 3 knights and 3 trolls and becuase of this you can jump right into the action!",FALSE,4,4,4,4,4
"Sauron_Bauglir","2010-12-17T23:25:18.157Z","I had a choice of this set and Tower Raid... and got it wrong.","<p>When I got this set , I had a choice of this or Tower Raid (7037). I got it wrong. These are the Pros and Cons for this set.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of ways to kill people!</li><li>Good minifigures- mainly the Troll captain.</li><li>Nice barricade- catapult works well.</li><li>If you destroy it, you get some good&nbsp;pieces, such as 6 spears!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Tower Raid is more fun, and better in many ways. More realistic, better figures, better parts...</li><li>The Battle Wheel rolls Ok but not fantastic.</li><li>Battle wheel is unrealistic and would not have existed in&nbsp;Medieval&nbsp;days.</li><li>The battle is unfair for the Trolls because once the barricade stops the Battle Wheel (With all those spikes, it would), the Trolls are left with 2 weaponless troops. The captain might be able to fend for himself, though.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is an Ok set, but if you are given the choice, Tower Raid is better and cheaper.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
