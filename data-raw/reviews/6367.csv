It allows your Mindstorms brick to act like an intelligent IR remote, controlling Power Functions motors and trains, and also the IR trains that predate the Power Functions, 7897 (passenger train)&nbsp;and 7898 (Cargo Train Deluxe).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The packaging is very simple, the box contains only the sensor. There is no cable so you need to use one from your existing set. First thing you need to do is go to the online support site and download the software which adds the relevant blocks into your programming environment. Then you can&nbsp;use the sensor in one of two ways. One is the old style IR train controller. There you have the option to use forward or reverse&nbsp;movement commands in 7 increments or send a stop signal to the train.&nbsp;The second way of use is as a PF remote. You select Red or Blue, and you can specify the power forward or backwards again in 7 increments. It works just like the PF train remote and hence has all the functionality of regular PF remote. Both modes give you the choice of IR channel, 3 channels in non-PF trains and 4 channels for Power Functions. </p>

<p>The first project we built with my son was a train station automation. We used the ultrasonic sensor to see if a train was coming into our station and we stopped the train with the IR Link Sensor. After a short break, the train was sent off at speed 4. What we discovered is that the sensor range and spread angle has some limitations so we needed to position and aim the&nbsp;sensor&nbsp;correctly&nbsp;to stop a fast moving train. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have IR trains or use PF motors, this sensor will open up many posssibilites to use your Mindstorms. You will be able to convert pretty much every Power Functions set into a computerized toy resulting in endless fun. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
