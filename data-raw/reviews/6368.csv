Over 30 years ago it was the biggest lego city set I ever had!

Pros:
- buliding with great proportions
- all walls in the building
- 7 figures
- handicapped person - the only such person in the whole lego universum
- emergency car with place for patient

Cons:
- there are no more such sets...

Great playability! (no matter if the people do not have hands - using imagination you train your maind :P)
Beautiful classic set!

<p><b>Minifigures:</b></p>

<p>It&#39;s slightly spooky for those of us that had smiling and movable minifigures and then discovered the land of the lost, their true origins. The parts are great though and nowadays make great extras for crowd scenes, old people, slaves, drones, clones, zombies, or just your favourite&nbsp;character. Either way you get seven of the rascals in this set and yes those red crosses are stickers (not good actually, nor on the 1970&#39;s firemen).</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;m Going Home In The Back Of An Ambulance</strong><br />
The neat ambulance has an access for a person on a stretcher (yes they fit) and the shiny headlights print of the time. Notable are the red arches, the flag, the aerial, the cute little windows and doors (Gah! try getting the people through these- certainly not for emergency exit!), the wheelchair with offset legs so they can &#39;sit down&#39;. By the way good luck getting access for interior&nbsp;play, this building is enclosed&nbsp;with&nbsp;dead space inside but is of course adaptable. There is a &#39;No Entry&#39; sign for traffic and the addition of foliage&nbsp;always improve the grounds of a building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this an early entry for emergency care. This was a 1975 set of now classic parts that I did not realise we had for decades. All the clues were there thanks to Brickset but the baseplate&nbsp;confirms it. The baseplate with its helpful white dotted line for placing the main building was helpful when children had to count across dozens of studs to place the foundations but looked odd if anyone wanted an alternate build that exposed the white dots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But&nbsp;its all looks pretty neat and lovable for&nbsp;that era of toy architecture and at least you know you have the right part.&nbsp;Remember something this basic feeds a growing mind and imagination responds to what&#39;s absent, not so much to a fully detailed and fully stickered&nbsp;ultra set with all the bells and whistles and leering expressions and multiple colour printed faces. I digress but the extremes of modern sets (that are also excellent in their own way)&nbsp;simply can not compete when it comes to the sheer diversity of alternative building available in these old sets.</p>

<p><strong>Discharged</strong><br />
An expert creator hospital should be on the cards and while this set is magic, I would even as a kid want to make an accessible interior for it.</p>
