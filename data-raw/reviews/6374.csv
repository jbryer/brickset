Like all the current Lego watches, this includes pieces, and a building among them, connecting each piece, forming the watch at all. The pieces in this set are light blue or white, good colors, useful to any Lego watch, but not completely compatible with other Lego sets. The numbers, altough small, are notable and can be seen easily. The image on the circular part is the minifigure of Luke Skywalker, the Star Wars logo and other few details. An illustrative addition, decent. Of course, like all the current Lego watches, this have a building, and this isn't good like in the sets, but is considerable for a watch. The watch hand is also really visible, but no much big. This watch is much small, maybe the sales of the Lego watches are directed for childrens, but still good.

The Jedi Luke Skywalker's minifigure, like in the Star Wars sets from the late 1990's years, features black and few white schemes, with a hair (the color isn't exactly wite or yellow). But this, have the skincolour, not bad, but also, no much useful with the original sets, due to the colour schemes' compatibility. The minifigure also have a green lightsaber (the light is green and the part to hang it is silver). Currently, the Jedi Luke Skywalker's minifigure is rare, but it isn't motive to get this clock. Altough this minifigure is more expensive than some other minifigs, when sold separetely (like in sites like ebay), if you get this with more other minifigures and pieces, or just with a set, by this price, buy it, and not the watch. Overall, this set is useful and nice, but is so much expensive. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
