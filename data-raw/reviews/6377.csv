It has 2 magna guards that are cool. The ship itself is well built. Took me about an hour to build due to the fact that tharer where no numbered bags. You had to dump all the pieces together so finding that one piece is hard. mine is missing a grey 1 by 4 but it gets covered up so you do not need it. The cocpit is cool the way it opens, much better than the gereral grevious ship. I do not see why the tops of the engins flip up but they do and you can put the electro staffs in them. there is a hidden missle launcher in the back but it does not work well.

One thing that confuses me though (I haven't seen the new Clone Wars movie) on starwars.com this design of starfighter is listed as a Utapaun starfighter and not one in the employ of the CIS. I guess it doesn't matter I just found it odd.

There where only a few things I didn't like about this set.

1. The hidden missiles on the back are a cool touch, but the cover seems to flip open whenever you try to hold this like other Lego starfighter sets.

2. the cockpit doesn't ever seem to close and stay closed correctly.

3. the price seems a bit ridiculous $45?

4. the magnagaurds are alright, but seem to be just a mix of existing droid pieces.

"MandalorianCandidate","2008-11-09T19:38:32.233Z","Magnaguards Shmagnaguards","Where to begin with this set....

As with most of the Clone Wars sets, the idea was there but the execution just didn't quite make it for me.  I'm not quite sure why Lego decided to make this set, it received very little screen time in the movie, but perhaps to be a companion piece to the V-19 Torrent so kids (and collectors) could have something to dogfight with.  Unfortunately most kids won't have enough $ to get this costly beast of a fighter and I think most collectors are thinking twice about getting this ship (I have yet to see one store be out of stock on this item).

I'm getting a little weary of the Lego concept of the 'flying cockpit,' meaning a big old ship with a lot of wing pieces for one little minifig and that's it...other than swooshing around there's not a lot of fun there.  We first got it with 1999's 7151 Sith Infiltrator (not so bad since it was the first of the SW Lego offerings) and its 2007 repeat but at least the price wasn't so high.  With the Magnaguard Starfighter though we're looking at $45.

There's a big paradox with this ship because there are some neat things going on.  First off we get the new Magnaguard Droids (a.k.a. General Grievous' bodyguards), and although they are basically a super battle droid skeleton with Popeye arms and a new head mold, it's nice to finally have them and they do look OK.  Second is the cockpit mechanism.  I hate having to pop off and on the windshield like Anakin's JSF and this mechanism is way neater than that of the A-Wing hinge.  The cockpit is also 'sealed,' which makes it nice.  The missile pod is OK (not a big fan of the flick-fire missiles) and adds some flavor to the ship.  The last feature I like are the battle stick holders one each engine nacelle.  It's no fun trying to cram the minifig's weapon in the cockpit then having it fly out if you can get the cockpit open from it being jammed by the offending item.

All this being said, I just can't enjoy this set like I want to.  I still hate the idea of stickers, but I can look past it if I choose not to put them on.  Like I said before, the ship is pretty much a cockpit with two huge wings and the two enormous wings.  I'm thinking that it would work just fine on a smaller scale, thus lowering the price and making it a better buy.  At the $45-50 price scale you would normally get at least four minifigs.  Because the ship is symmetrical the build is somewhat tedious toward the end making the wings and engines.  The design is very faithful to the 5.5 seconds the ships are on screen in the movie, but they are pretty monochromatic, though the dark red pieces and wing elements may be good for customs.

"Leggodt94","2009-01-02T00:40:36.437Z","""Where are my Bodyguards?!?"" - General Grievous ","Well, I wanted this set when it came out way back in August. It is surprising to me that this set has received so many critiques when it such a wondeful set. Now, the main and probably only reason I got this set was for the magna guard minifigs and did not expect much from the model itself. However, I was wrong; the model shows much detail and action features like the flick-fire missiles and pop-open windshiels. The way the bodygruard fits into the cockpit was also very crafty. The detail of the model resembling the actual thing shows a lot of that George Lucas creativity that I love. Anyways, all in all, this set is terrific. Although my intentions were a bit overpriced, this set proved to be more than what it's worth. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

First off, this set is superb. With its new windsheild, new mini-figs, and overall design, this is one of the best looking starfighters out there. For once, Lego actually was able to get the set design smooth, but yet nice and blocky. The size is very decieving. It looks small, but is very decently sized. I'm impressed with the magnaguards, but I really wish they didnt have the shoulder capes. The staffs are sweet and the new purple cones have many uses. The back mounted flick-missles are a good idea. Best of all, the swooshability on this thing is amazing. You can almost hear the thrusters roaring as you swoosh it by. I really like the windshield. Its not too big, but its not overly small. 

Pros:
Size
Fair price
Overly armed
New peices
Brand new Magnaguards
Perfect and I mean perfect colors
Extremely detailed
I have two, so my shelf looks sweet

Cons:
The magnaguards heads and capes are disappointing, but not too bad

"Kalhiki","2009-05-03T10:19:00.17Z","Pretty nice","Got it a Toys R Us and I must say it was pretty nice. Building it doesn't take that long, but hey, it's the set that you want so what does it matter? Yes, there are stickers, but that isn't so bad I guess. 
The cockpit has a cool function to open it by pushing two ball jont pieces on the bottom forward to open.  
It also has two flick fire missiles on the back which can be positioned in different directions making you able to fire them above, behind, and on the bottom of the ship. 
The electro-staffs can be put in the back of the wings for storage, but only really one will be put away because there will always be a magna guard out because the ship, sadly, only fits one.
The magna guard also doesn't really sit nicely in the cockpit, but that can be easily fixed by clipping a piece onto the ship's steering handle (battle droid arm).
Pros and Cons:
Pros:
pretty cool looking magna guards.
nice ship that holds together
posable flick-fire missles
storage for electro-staff
function to open cockpit

cons:
Price. $50 bucks? for the size I'd probably only pay $40-$45
Flick fire missiles are kind of hard to fire when facing backwards

Only seats one.

"DarthSteve","2009-11-19T20:50:45.187Z","An Instant Favorite","I just bought the Magna Guard Starfighter tonight and after building it, I immediately had to sit down and write an awesome review for it!

There are many reasons this set is to die for: for starters, it features two very detailed Magna Droid minifigs, who serve as bodyguards for Count Dooku and General Grievous (two of my all-time favorite STAR WARS characters).

On to the ship itself: It's BIG! In Canada, it cost me around $60.00 including taxes tonight, and it's worth every penny, I guarantee it! The storage compartments that hold the Magna Droids' Lightsaber Staves are well done; you can access them by lifting the wings on either side of the ship. The back end folds down to reveal flick missiles and the design of the mechanism used to control the cockpit opening and closing is pure genius. A ball joint on either side under the wings can be pushed forward, causing the window to slide forward and open up. I love it!

The only part I had slight difficulty with were the two rubber pieces that make up the top part of the guns on the front of the wings. I had to fight with them a little so they would stretch enough to hold in place - but once I did, it was no problem. The only real Con I can find with this set is that there is no General Grievous minifig included, considering that it comes with two of Grievous' bodyguards.

"Vayne","2015-01-12T16:23:20.96Z","7673-1: MagnaGuard Starfighter Review","<p>Hi folks, time to do a quick review over the MagnaGuard Starfighter. I think I&#39;m lucky for finding those 2008 sets laying around shelves in my city, too bad they are priced the same as the new ones.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a bit larger than the ship. No numbered bags, but since its a 400~ pcs set, isn&#39;t that hard to separate and organize all bricks. A big nice manual , and a 10 sticker sheet. Nothing too usual worth of being mentioned.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some new bricks that I&#39;ve never seen before, like the forky thing on the tip of the side guns, the big cockpit helm , and that rubber parts that add a nice touch to the whole thing. The Magna Guard heads and capes are cool too, the capes specially, very detailed in the bottom.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Gotta love those guys. Their head and cape are awesome. The only problem I see is that you can&#39;t fit both in the ship, well, it&#39;s kinda hard to sit even one of them because of the cape. A blessing and a curse, those are. The red stud on it chest increases the contrast and make the whole thing more interesting. My biggest complain is with their weapon. There is a white tip leftover in one end of the staff and it kills the symmetry, but is necessary to store it inside the ship and that purple tip looks cool from rear view.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite easy. The cockpit part is the most interesting session of the build. Aside from it it&#39;s very repetitive due the ship symmetry . Both sides are identical, so be ready to build 2 of each for the most part of it. There are 10 stickers, for some this is a let down, but it adds a nice touch , like those 2 big ones in the upper plates. Took a bit over 3 hours to build,</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The complete model is great. Swooshable and great for display (my case). The lever mechanism that opens the cockpit is really cool and easy to build. The top of the both motors (or turbines) open up, where you can see some nice sticker details and store the Magna Guards staffs at the end of it. The rear end stores a fun hidden flicker missile storage that opens and close very well. The build is sturdy, except for the lateral lasers that is hold by a single connector at the middle, so it isn&#39;t very stable. That rubber detail on the turbines helps to hold it whole and looks awesome.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty model. Looks great on display, the Magna Guards are awesome, and I&#39;m happy I found this jewel. Buy it if you can. It&#39;s a nice add to any collection (and mine) and, again, thanks for the other reviews and users. They&#39;ve helped me a lot and I hope I can help you too.</p>
