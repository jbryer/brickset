"lego12","2008-07-24T17:51:44.327Z","Watch out for the V-19 Torrent!","   This set is amazing! I think the set is a bit expensive,$55, but it is worth the price! It comes with a Clone pilot minifigure which is awesome!  It should have came with two pilots, but thats asking too much. The wings, which are the best part, are sweet! The function is cool! You push back the top wing and it is ready to take off! The cockpit is the same as the one with the General Grevious Starfighter. This set is superb and deserves a five, even thought the price is a bit steep....but anyway I give it a five and I reccomend you go and buy it! One of the best Clone Wars sets! :D  I give it a 5/5 or a 10/10! Thanks for taking the time to read this review and I hope you enjoyed it! :D

"arctrooper170","2008-08-01T14:40:43.483Z","The V-19 scores a 5","This is my second clone wars set, ( first was the republic attack gunship) and I have to say this one was quite impressive and complicated to build. The wings and landing gear moving at the same time is incredible, the way they got the cockpit to open was ingenious, and I personally dont think that 55.00 was much. (come you whimps, all of us knew how much they were going to cost) I cant wait to see it in action in the movie. Now the pros and cons:

PROS
1. huge
2. ingenious design
3. folds up nicely
4. amazing detail
5. awsome minifig
6. hard to build

"dragon_teenager","2008-08-12T19:26:40.86Z","Not flawless, but impressive","PROS:

- The fighter has an extremely impressive wingspan. I have not measured it, but it appears to be significantly over a foot long. 

- The hydraulic mechanism is both clever and functional, and it's certainly the most impressive part of this set. It works fluidly and consistently. 

- The ship feels extremely solid. I don't think it would survive a four foot drop, because of the wings, but the main body of the ship is very study. 

- Good detail. The engines, body, and wings all look great. This would be a good display model if it wasn't for the fact that it needs to be folded up in order to sit on a shelf. 

- Useful parts.

- Not too many stickers. 

- Excellent swooshability. 

CONS:

- Frustrating build. I don't mind technic, but there's no denying that this model takes way longer to build than it should. It took me about two hours, mostly because I goofed up on one of the engines and had to rebuild it. Once the technic part is done, however, it's pretty easy and very satisfying. 

- The bottom/top wing is not locked into place in flight mode. I learned to carry it by the top of the bottom wing in order to keep it from swinging. 

- There's a huge gap in the cockpit and I see no reason why the designers couldn't have fixed it. 

- $54.99 is a steep price.


VERDICT: 

This set is satisfying to play with once completed, and probably the best non-exclusive CW set. Unfortunately a few minor design flaws and a frustrating build keep it from becoming a legend. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Cashcleaner","2008-08-10T01:34:28.013Z","Kinda disappointing...","I'm not a huge Star Wars fan by any stretch, but I do love the Clone Wars storyline of the series and the V-19 is possibly my most favourite vehicle featured in the animated series and upcoming movie.  Obviously, as soon as I saw the ship in the 2008 catalogue I knew I had to pick it up.  All said, it does look great, but there are a number of issues I have with the model.

Firstly, building the V-19 wasn't too difficult for the most part. A lot of major pieces came together rather easily, with the notable exception of the side folding wings.  The gear mechanisms were very tempermental during their construction and I had to take them both apart several times and rebuild the engine assemblies to get them to join up just right.  Unfortunately, even with the gear assemblies rebuilt and realigned, the wings don't make a good transition from the upright position to flight positions.

Secondly, I really think a display base of some sort should have been included with the kit.  There's no easy way of displaying the model in flight mode as the bottom wing gets in the way.  LEGO was able to solve the problem with their B-Wing model but no such luck for the V-19.

When all is said and down, the V-19 does look pretty cool and has a distinct &quot;wow factor&quot; with the moving wings, but it's overall design is flawed and too flimsy for my liking.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-06T20:06:24.937Z","Nice V-19","I really think the Clone Wars set are much better than the movie itself. This set is the V-19 Torrent seen in the movie in a really animated way. The Lego version is way better than the movie and there is no excuse for that.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kiwikat","2008-09-12T21:46:47.997Z","Very Cool!","This is my first review on the site.  I'll start out with saying I'm a collector and don't really &quot;play&quot; with the various creations I have.

The last thing I built was the AT-TE which set the bar pretty high for me.  The V-19 easily meets that bar if not raises it slightly.  It is quite a bit bigger than I expected it to be and twice as long to build as I thought it would take.  Just thinking about the piece count I thought an hour to an hour 15 minutes would be adequate.  Due to the complexity and technic pieces, it took just over 2 hours for me to casually build it. (I never rush my builds)  When finished, it looks and feels very solid.

Pros:
-(relatively)difficult build due to technic pieces
-relatively long build time for piece count
-looks accurate
-very solid structure, doesn't feel like it will break at all
-clone comes with a rifle
-great folding wings/gear design

Cons:
-another figure would have been nice
-LEGO, please PLEASE get rid of these stickers...
-there's a small hole in the cockpit behind where the clone's head is

Neutrals:
-I'm not too fond of flick missiles
-a bit pricey for the piece count but you do get what you paid for
-I find the bottom of the ship to look kind of silly but it is probably just me

In summary, the V-19 is a fairly good addition to your collection if you are solely a collector.  Those who like to play with their models will like it even more.  If you are comfortable with dealing with all of the technic pieces and are a fan of Star Wars ships, this is for you.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Well thought out set and robust. Love the way the wings open and close. very smooth. Dont like the way the nose sits low down when standing and also think the cockpit area could have been a little better, it will get very cold in there!

"MandalorianCandidate","2008-11-18T12:29:06.763Z","Nice engineering but needs some work","Like the 7673 Magnaguard Starfighter, the 7674 V-19 Torrent was an ambitious undertaking by the Lego designers.  Perhaps it's just intrinsic with the original Lucasfilm design, but the V-19 seems to have the greater potential of the two to having a more desirable Lego version.  I remember watching the original CW toons and thinking, &quot;Daaaaaaang, I gots to get me one of those!&quot;  So when I found out that we'd be getting one with the CW line I was excited.  My excitement was tempered by discovering the cost of the ship ($55--strike one) and that it had only one minifig (clone pilot--strike two).  I am sooo close to giving it strike three due to what I perceive to be a crucial design flaw but I'm trying to be objective as possible, so here goes.

This is again another 'flying cockpit,' just like the Sith Infiltrator and the Magnaguard (MG) ship.  However it is not quite the same since the wings are not as complex as with the aforementioned other two sets, hence the second wing's build is not that tedious (and the third wing is different altogether).  What sets this ship apart is the very complex wing mechanism, which makes the cockpit/fuselage larger and more intricate than other fighters. The centerpieces here are the two pistons that control movement of the landing gear to move back and up toward the fuselage when the center wing is pushed down.  The center wing is also connected to the side wings by a series of two gears on each side that hook into the engine nacelles via two sets of ball-type cogs (possibly from bionicle?), turning the nacelles and the wings downward with very little effort.  I must say this is the most elegant engineering I've seen in a Lego set to date.

That being said...I hate it.  For the life of me I can't get the wings to stay in the upright landing position when the ship is picked up unless I hold the wings.  I've fiddled endlessly with the mechanism and just can't get it to stay still.  Also, when the wings are in flight mode, the center wing won't stay fully level and dips down just slightly.  I'm hoping that I'm just blind and/or mechanically inept and am missing some crucial step but I think not.  Combing the forums of sites like fbtb.net seems to produce page after page of similar issues.  I also give a thumbs down to Lego for picturing the ship in their adds as being level when it in fact is angled downward.  My thinking is to help keep the wings from falling over while sitting on a flat surface, but again maybe I just put together the landing gear screwy.

Moving on, there are other pluses.  The sliding cockpit is great, but not as good as the MG ship.  It has a slight tendency to lift up at the sliding handle, but the hinge to lift the screen up once fully pulled out is kinda cool.  It comes with four flick missiles although there are two missiles ports.  The mechanism here is a little better than normal because instead of flicking the missile, you hit a rod that slams into the missile, shooting it out.  The detail on the ship is also pretty intricate as with the wing guns, engine nacelles, and landing gear.  We also get the new CW clone pilot, which is essentially a clone with a different helmet design.  I suppose it's also nice that there are only three stickers (two republic symbols for the wings and a design on the cockpit nose), yet why couldn't these have been tampographed like the image on the cockpit instrument panel tile?

Besides the faulty/loose wing design I don't like just getting one minifig.  For the price there should have been at least one more.  We got two MG's with the 7673, why not a pilot and an R2 or a second clone or a generic Jedi with this one.  I'm fortunate in that I found one on ebay for about $20 (new, but removed from the box) that had the pilot and his gun removed.  Next year with the clone trooper army pack I'll be able to replace the pilot and add three of his buddies for $10.  The cockpit also suffers from ARC-170itis (big ole hole in the back).

My solution would have been to make a smaller ship with the more conventional click hinges, like the original X-Wing.  I wonder if the rubber banded approach that was in the newer X-Wing or even the Imperial Landing Craft turnknob mechanism would have worked here.  The price could have thus been lower by not needing to make new parts, like the pistons, or having the large wings.

The design here is very faithful to cartoon and it does look aesthetically pleasing, except for all the technic guts hanging out. I think the dark red pieces and wing elements may be good for customs, but you'll have to be pretty creative about using the technic pieces in mods...but hey, that's what Lego is all about!

"Loganwan","2008-12-18T15:17:09.687Z","V-ery nice set","I am very impressed with the design of the Torrent.  It is a very strong ship with a spectacular array of gears and such for the wings to all fold together.  The weight of the large center wing is enough that when it is released, it will slowly fall and allow the other two wings to drop as well.

I am surprised to hear others say that the wings don't work.  When all of the gears are in place, it is solid.

I am amazed by the size of the ship.  In the show it is usually near the larger command ships, so it is hard to get a sense of the size, but it is very good compared to the drop-ship.

The color scheme is right on for the rest of the line.  And with only 3 stickers to boot.

I agree with other posts that do not like the fact that the cockpit is open in the back, but it is covered enough that it is not noticeable unless you are looking for it.

"legoclone","2009-01-05T13:47:46.86Z","Nice looking - some issues","Finally got the V-19 (discounted to $41.99 at TRU surprisingly enough) and have to say it is a nice addition to the 2008 collection.  First off, it’s bigger than I thought it would be.  This thing is almost close in size to the ARC-170.  Some of the build was a little technical due to the wing operation so some younger kids might need help.  There is the annoying cockpit open gap (which is getting more and more common – Lego people!) but this one is easily remedied with a couple pieces from the spare-parts box.  I like the enhanced flick missile launchers and the locking bar that allows you to fix the wings up in the landing position.  Overall this is a nice looking kit but I have 2 main issues.  First off, the extending landing gear is cool in operation but it would be nice if it allowed the V-19 to sit more level on the ground rather than in the nose-down position. Also, the pistons for the swing-around wings have too much play.  Thus when swooshing the V-19 around the wings bounce a lot.  If you go inverted the wings go to nearly level with the cockpit instead of maintaining the downward in-flight swoop associated with the V-19.  I fixed this by using two technic pins in strategically located holes on either engine cowling to “lock” the wings down but it’s a pain to have to do this.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The cockpit slides and tilts nicely, too. Very nice touch.

Truly a beauty of a ship. Wings fold practically and thereby some shelf room is saved, but then in flying mode it gets really huge for it's price point (even at full price). Overall well-thought set. Maybe the back of pilot's cockpit needs more cover, but then again the middle wing wouldn't work as supposed to.

The build was great fun, it was quite some time ago since my last build due to less money to spend and less space to display them, but that unique LEGO vibe speedily came back to me and I found myself having great fun putting the 471 pieces together. 

LEGO incorporated some great techniques for the wings and the sliding cockpit. I really hope they make some more of those sliding cockpit-designs in the future. It adds so much realism and just looks great. 

In response to some negative feedback in some reviews below: there ís room for the Blaster Rifle. It's even shown in the building instructions. There is enough leg space for the Clone Pilot so that he can put its rifle 'next' to him resting the tip on the bottom of the cockpit. It's not the best solution, but you at least got that out of the way.

"Alemas","2009-06-01T08:17:32.153Z","Here's a more in-depth review!","Ok, now that I have more experience is reviewing, here's a more detailed review of this amazing set:
First of all, let's start with the main function: the lowering of the wings and the landing ""feet"" using the middle wing. It's absolutely stunning. The LEGO designers had to make everything work in sinc, and they made it work perfectly. It's the best non-Technic engineering I've ever seen. LEGO System outside, Technic inside. Also, the air-pumps work to slow the wings down when they go back up, otherwise the middle wing will crash into the back of the cockpit and snap off.
Now, to the wings: very, very detailed, especially the middle wing, with all those little pieces giving more detail. The guns are awesome, and do look menacing. The flick-fire missles, well, don't really work, and I doubt it that in the movie it had these missles. I imagine if George Lucas made and released the film in... say, 2000, and LEGO released this set in that year, it would have looked like a block of 2x2 and 2x3 slope bricks with no detail. Back then LEGO didn't have the smooth pieces we have here, and they make this set very detailed.
To the fuselage: very smooth; it's a whole block of smoothness! It has a lot of smooth pieces, and also features the supports for the engines.
The engines: very good, with a lot of detail and, again, smoothness. When the wings lower and go up, part of the engine rotates. The middle engine on the middle wing does have a tendency to rotate, but it can be easily re-aligned.
Now, to the cockpit: inside, there isn't much, but the outside has a cool function: the cockpit glides out, then ""dips"", to make it open. Very cool.

Overall, it has the best non-Technic engineering I've ever seen. All that detail, elegance, and smoothness, makes this set worthy of a five. Get it if you can!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Add to the mix a pair of plunger-propelled flick missiles - flick-fires do, most of the time, work with a mechanism behind them - and a very fetching graphic on the nose of the vehicle, and the V-19 measures up as a brilliant addition to the Clone Wars milieu.<br></p><p>Or, does it? There are limitations, however, and they do detract. One, the wings are a little difficult to position, and they flap about like mynocks. Sometimes, they'll line up fine, other times one of them will lean a bit. It's quietly annoying. Also, the mechanism for aligning the wings is stiff and often unwieldy, limiting that playability factor. Also, the landing gear is canted, meaning that the fighter leans forward when landed. Is it supposed to do that? I swear I followed the instructions, which can be confusing by the way. Also, the cockpit nose sometimes slides out when the ship is canted forward, which is irritating.</p><p>Also, £40? Whoa, that's the price a Coruscant Senator would cough up for!<br></p><p>Despite its flaws, the V-19 is a great ship, and with some possible modifications can be incredibly fun to swoosh and play with.<br></p><p><br></p><p>-maaboo35<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"Mandalorian","2012-12-28T06:12:01.52Z","One of the best Republic Starfighters","I have had this set for quite a long time now, about a year, and it still continues to impress me. When in landing position, it looks nice, but not overly impressive. Whith wings unfolded, however, it is absolutely huge! The shape is nice and different from everything else, largely due to the middle fin. The landing gear is superbly designed, and makes the ship sit slightly on an angle, nose down. This gives it a bit of a ""mean"" look when in landing position. The flick missiles actually look good in this set, too. Placed under the wings, they add a small detail to the ship.<br><b>Pros:<br></b><ul><li>Huge and impressive when in flight position</li><li>Flick missiles don't look bad</li><li>A lot of nice parts</li><li>Enjoyable building experience</li><li>Cool retractable landing gear</li><li>Nice Clone Pilot minifigure<br></li><li>Lasting appeal.</li></ul><p><b>Cons:</b></p><ul><li>Pretty expensive today</li></ul><p>If you can afford to buy this set, by all means do. It is a great addition to any Republic army.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"reidak12","2011-08-02T21:56:03.937Z","amazing","<p>I bought this on Ebay, and when I was about halfway through building it, I realized that it was no ordinary model. It actually has automatic landing gear!</p>
<p>Pros: </p>
<p>cool cockpit</p>
<p>wings unfold at the same time</p>
<p>automatic landing gear</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>nowhere to put blaster</p>
<p>flick fire missiles</p>
<p>In conclusion, although this set is not incredible, and does not have too many good points, the few it has are incredible. If you can get a good price, get it.</p>

"Vayne","2014-12-02T18:11:52.587Z","Best set I own.","<p>Well, this is my 1st review in this site, and since english is not my home language, I&#39;ll try my best to write up my thoughts on this set. I bought this set brand new behind lots of other sets in store in my country, paid around 130USD (lego here is overpriced.). Felt kinda lucky since I read some reviews here, and it&#39;s an old toy, so I had to grab it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a dozen sets, but this one made me create an account and post a review about it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is big, and but I really don&#39;t care about it size. I just store em all. Instructions are very well detailed for a model with so many mechanics. Very easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of white, a little bit of red and some swamp green for the bottom. The highlight of this set to me is the pistons. I never saw&nbsp;that before, and after the model was done, I was really amazed at&nbsp;how well and smooth the whole system stays.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Only one Clone Pilot. For people that like minifigs, it&#39;s not cool. But I can&#39;t see how they can insert more minifigs in this set since it&#39;s a fighter ship. I think there is not much to say about it, they all look pretty standard to me.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Ohh, the best part. The build. Took me around 4-6 hours to build it. Lots of technic involved in this build. The system that moves the side wing, the rear one and the landing gear is just amazing. When I was building , I really couldn&#39;t figure how those mechanics would blend, but after finished I had to admit that this is the coolest set I have. But I got to add, it&#39;s not a easy model to build, due to the complex folding system. There are some stickers, something I&#39;m already used to, so I really don&#39;t mind.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The complete model is amazing. When landed, the ship is stays in a cool angle, with all wings up and landing gear deployed. With a single lever, you can lower all wings and landing gear goes up in a smooth motion, thanks to the complex piston system. It&#39;s really cool the way the wings move . The cockpit is very cool too, sliding back and down, feels like a real jet. The wingspan when open is wider than my 8039 Venator lenght . I don&#39;t mind much to missiles and stuff, so I won&#39;t enter in details. The set is very sturdy, more than I thought, with those big movable wings.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I just started watching Clone Wars, a few days after buying this set, and I think it&#39;s very cool to have this ship in my collection. I felt like a kid when I saw it in the very start of the series, like &quot;wow, I have that ship&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very happy with this ship. It&#39;s by far my favorite set due the complexity of the build and the final result. The first time I unfolded it&#39;s wings and saw all those Technics moving I was really amazed.</p>

<p>More than this, I gotta thank this site and the reviewers , if I haven&#39;t read some of them before, I wouldn&#39;t pay attention in this ship and surely would let someone buy it lol.</p>

<p>If you have the chance, buy it. I think it&#39;s a must have, as a Lego , Star Wars theme, or Clone Wars fan.</p>
