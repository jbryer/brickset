"wyoeaglefan","2008-07-22T13:37:40.873Z","An Improvement","This set is definately an improvement over the original AT-TE. It is considerably moe sturdy and the top is put together much more logically. The only slight downside I find with it is the lack of actual trooper minifigs, I mean after all the original one came with like 6. As far as price goes I notice all the Star Wars sets seem to be increasing a bit(even relative to quality decreasing on some)but I figure Lego is just trying to make a buck out of the dwindling years of one of their best franchises. All of that aside, the AT-TE for the clone wars is better than the Episode 2 one, let's hope the Republic Gunship holds true to that one as well. (I missed the first one) ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Nate_Wan","2008-07-27T22:40:59.467Z","All Terrain Tactical Enforcer","Well to start one of my first reviews in a while this set is great.
The Packaging:
The box is great and really shows off the tank as well as draw the eye. One complaint I have is WHAT HAPPENED TO NUMBERED BAGS! I had to seperate everything into small tupperware containers which took a small chunk of my time.
The Minifigs:
Rex:
Rex is my favorite fig in this set. His awsome helmet and the most unique clone head make him a great figure. He is the only figure I think looks really good with the dual pistols and even better with my brickarms.
Asohka:
Asokha is a nice figure. she's our first Togruta (Heres hoping for Shaak-Ti in a Force Unleashed set!)The head piece stays firmly in place and the complete fiure is appealing
Anakin: This is the same Anime style Anakin we've had since winter.
The Build:
The most important part of any model the build is really fun but gets a bit repetetive. The leg design is intresting with rubber bands to move the legs back into place. My main dissapointment is that they used the quick AT-AP style plating so there are quite a few open spaces.
The Model:
This set looks nice when finished. The aforementioned open spaces do add some problems. But all in all it looks good on my dresser there are seats for eight figures and plenty of weapons.
Playabilty:
This is an awsome set for play. Its rougly the size of the MTT and looks great in fights with that, the Hailfire droid , and the new Spider Droid. With four guns in front, two in back, two concealed missle launchers and the big rotating cannon this is a fun toy.

Its only $90. The twilight for $100 thats a joke, you sould get this and save $10. 

Very good design, has lots of opening hatches, The big gun on top is cool. Its a little hard to move the front and back legs but the middle ones work fine. The missle launching system is genius and powerful, It broke the stap in half. The new stap design is better than the old one. 

Ahsoka is cool, so is anakin except for his creepy new face. Rotta is very very small and i dont understand why he doesnt come with a second set of arms, They are so small. the new clones are awesome I love the new clone accesories. I love captain rex I love his helmet design.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Da_LegoBuilder","2008-07-28T13:51:33.687Z","The great bug is back!","Worth the $90, get it soon! greatly suggest to get it! its a powerful 6-legged walker that can destroy almost anything it is path! You can omve the legs and can put in any positon you want! The turret even move and has 2 dual firing missle near the cockpit! The missle is not flick firing, but the one that come wtih the nabbostarfighter, and the landing craft. You can move the armor, and it one compartment there is a seating for 4 clone troopers and many other acessories! There is a new blue STAP, and a battle droid riding it! The cannon on top is exactly like the AT-AP. the only difference is that it is way bigger! It is about 1 foot long and 8 inches high. Very big bug! There re gaps in the armor for any enemy to crawl inside or toss a grenede! The cockpit can open and close easily, and it won't break! I love the turrets come with 6 rotating ones and a masive one on top! 

The minifigs are awesome, comes wtih Ani, Ahsoka, Rotta the hutt (jabbas son) Commander REx (of the 501st legion) a clone and battle droid. Commander rex has the same stuff as the other commanders. (kama, pauldron, antenna, binocualars, and helmet to show rank)  Love the detail on all of the new minifigs (excpet the droid, duh!)   

Here's another summary of this set:

Pros:
-Big!
-Lots of minifigs
-Love the work on Rex, really looks like the one in the trailer!
-Has a simple color scheme, not like the old one, green, red, and grey!
-really looks like the real thing in the movie!

Cons:
-Gaps in the armor
-I would be nice to have more clones!!
-Why would they have a troop compartment bay, it only comes with a clone and commander!
-If rex is battling on the ground (which is what he is best at) and the other clone is driving the AT-TE, then who is manning the top turret?!
-the missles are piont less, just take up essential room.

So i think it is worth it! It was worth the waitng and now worth the money, get it soon!

"georgetan9","2008-08-07T22:48:47.513Z","You are lucky if you get this set below USD100!","I have been pending and waiting this set for long time since it release on the 26 July 08. I'm so admire those who live in US can pay for this set in a very good price, compare to Malaysia I bought it at least double the price. I have bought this set in Malaysia at least cost me at RM599.90 which is USD 181.  That's the reason I have been pending so long to consider, after I have read all the review and picture from other web, and finally I can't hold it and I bought it at Malaysia's Toyrus with 10% discount only. 
First, I can say the whole design are really excellent for the AT-TE Walker. Put a side commend for AT-TE, just only those figures are already worth the value. Specialy for the Captain Rex and Ahsoka are the best looking figure I ever have. Come to the AT-TE details, I don't want to put too much commend, because you can get to know from others review, and I found their review most of it are very useful. 
Pros:
- Excellent Figure
- Good looking for the AT-TE
- Nice interior to fitting in the troopers
- Good looking on the box
- Box's material have very much improvement on the paper material
- Excellent Figure for Captain Rex! (Best starwars Figure so far)

The color is awesome (much better than the bright green glass on the last AT-TE), the figures are awesome (especially Captain Rex), two launching missiles, Plenty of room inside the AT-TE to put Clones and Jedi inside including: cockpit for one clone, mission brief cabin for Jedi (which seems to have a box of some sort that can fit small things such as the visor, pauldron, attenaes, and lights), and a troop bay for four clones.

PROS:
-Captain Rex
-One of two sets to include Ahsoka and Rotta the Hutt
-Plenty of room for clone army inside
-2 launching missiles (which is pretty unique for a set)
-Cool cannon on top that can move all directions
-STAP vehicle is very cool also with the droid
-A good size set
-Handle to make it easier to pick up

CONS:
-Not enough clones!  This set should include at least four but it only has two!  Not even enough Clones to put one on the cannon
-Stickers

Firstly, rotta is cool as a lego character but ridiculous as a star wars character. Personally i think the new animated (thus the anime looking annie)clone wars movie that came out today is a total disgrace to star wars. ANY way, the number of clone troopers needed to suit the entire walker is 8, but the set leaves us with a pathetic two. theres also a worthless pole thingy in the center of the AT proobably used to take up space. On to the pros, the characters are great and EXTREMELY rare, especially the ashoka jedi figure. The walker is constructed sturdily, except for a few cracks.  i suggest you buy it while you still can, its a fantastic lego",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mars4life","2008-08-18T14:18:21.45Z","Nice Set!","Though I'm not a fan of the Clone Wars movie, I'm glad it's brought back some great sets like this. This set is a lot bigger than it looks on the box. The new clone minifigs are sweet with their cool accessories, but their faces are wierd. Their eyes are way too big and Rex has a beard, which makes him look like Obi-Wan Kenobi. The other clone looks like Anikan. Ahsoka is cool, but I don't think Anikan should have an apprentice, so I use her as Shakk-Ti, who is cooler. Anikan is strange, he looks a little emo, and I don't like his hair. Rotta was an interesting idea, but he's pretty useless. And why would the Jedi be protecting a Hutt? It's ludicrous! As if Jabba doesn't have enough guards. And the Hutts are bad guys too!
The STAP is really cool. If it's next to the STAP's from the droid battle packs it looks like an officer STAP.
The build for the AT-TE was easy and fun. I didn't have any problems except for one missing piece which I easily got from my collection. The AT-TE looks really impressive, and the big gun is nice, except that all you have to do is shoot the clone on it because he has no protection.

"Cashcleaner","2009-01-16T05:19:27.39Z","A good addition to any respectable Star Wars collection","<p>So I finally bit the bullet and picked up the new AT-TE from the local Wal-Mart. The cost (excluding taxes) was around $120.00 CDN which is no small amount of coin, so I was hoping that the kit would be really well designed and detailed.<br />
<br />
And luckily, it is...kinda.<br />
<br />
In terms of the overall look and functionality of the set, it&#39;s pretty solid. It happens to be quite large and bulky - just like the 3D model it&#39;s based on, and displays really nicely alongside my V-19 Torrent and other Star Wars sets. There&#39;s no denying that LEGO threw a lot of bricks into the box and the whole thing has some serious weight to it! In addition to the primary model itself, the box comes with 5 minifigs, 6 if you count the baby Hutt. Personally, I would have preferred another one or two clone troopers to go with the AT-TE, instead of the Battle Droid flying the STAP.<br />
<br />
Now, while the vehicle looks great on the outside when all the hatches are closed up, it does seem a little unfinished inside. I&#39;m okay with the cramped interior, weapon rack, and seating areas, but the lack of a continuous floor along the underbelly of the vehicle is a bit of a sore spot for me.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, I always rate the value of kits over anything else and while $120.00 CDN is quite steep for any LEGO kit, it&#39;s definitely money well-spent if you are a dedicated Star Wars fan.</p>

"MandalorianCandidate","2009-04-16T08:28:39.873Z","Another one for the clearance sales","Hmm, as with the 7674 V-19 Torrent, I really want to like this version of the AT-TE.  It looks nice, has an updated ‘sculpt’ from the 2003 4482 AT-TE, and even comes with firing missiles.  Unfortunately, just like the V-19, this set just doesn’t quite have the WOW factor.

Instead of delving right into complaints, I want to address the positive things about this set.  Although it looks very similar to the 2003 iteration, there are some nice updates.  First, the legs.  The front and rear sets have a rubber-banded hinge that allow the leg to ‘straighten’ but then move right back into position when put back on a flat surface.  The side legs are on a swivel hinge that keeps them flexible for when it is put on an uneven surface.  Definitely a nice touch.  Another plus is the cockpit design, which is not translucent green but clear.  It was made to have some depth to it but with a slider pilot’s seat, similar to the 7166 Imperial Shuttle passenger sled but for one minifig only.  The cockpit opens downward, same as the previous one.

Other pluses:
-The manned turret gun is really huge, so huge .. it .. kind .. of .. sinks .. slowly .. downward and then becomes a bit of an annoyance.  But it’s still nice to have.  It’s a lot bigger than the earlier incarnation’s gun and is moved behind the cockpit.
-The four side panels open easily and the two top flaps are click-hinged, allowing them to stay open without falling down.
-An equipment carrier in the forward compartment for clone gear (well, only the headlights and range finders).
-The size, which is over a foot long.  It would be nice to fit other stuff on my bookshelf with it, but it is a good beefy vehicle.
-The missile launching feature is pretty slick and simple to use.
-Seating for six clones in the fuselage.
-The blue battle droid STAP is a good addition, but why not an extra one for Anakin to ride?

Oddly, one of the main things that make the set realistic in form, but is one of my major turnoffs, are the ‘floating’ side panels.  From the basic form of Lego geometry, it’s difficult to get that angled shape from side panels while hooking up with the floor, hence the major gaps all around the interior.  This was my major gripe with the 7261 Clone Turbo Tank and probably will be for the 7671 AT-AP (whenever I get around to putting it together).  I understand the engineering behind the design, but I just hate the openings.

The set also has about 10-12 stickers, but none of them are STAMPS.  The cockpit side windows each have one, but I don’t think they are necessary.

As for the minifigures, there are really only two I would want to get from this set:  Captain Rex and Ahsoka (that can now be bought in the WM exclusive 7751 set).  Anakin is the same from the $20 JSF set, the Clone Trooper is the same as from the battle pack, the BD is also an old sculpt, and Rotta…meh.  I think that if you’re going to plop down $90, you ought to be able to get more than 6 minifigs, one of which is just a block.  The Indy Jones 7627 set has 10 minifigs and is $10 cheaper, so why not stock this one up with a couple of extra clones or another unique character?

For modders, there are tons of technic style pieces, plates/tiles, 8 chairs, and other assorted parts for some nice customizing.  There are quite a few dark red pieces, a color that’s not too common, but most everything else is black or the blays.

I thought I had to grab it, and did. Turns out, it was worth it. And compare it to the old one, which I also have: amazing. The old one was kinda flat and squatted. this is Tall, and you fear it. The old one...was more mad for children. This actually shows the power of the republic army. It can actually walk, unlike the old one. The roof opens nicely, and inside there is a container and four sets. The Cannon on top, is just massive. It can turn 360 degrees and goes up and down. The firing missiles I had to adjust, but they work. now to the STAP. Its very big, if you compare it to the ones from the Droid battle packs. It's also sturdy. The minifigures: the droid is nothing special. Anikan, well his face is kinda weird, but otherwise he's fine. Ahsoka: she's kinda fat compared to the movie Ahsoka, but the new headpiece is cool.

The ONLY complaint I have is that it would be nice to be getting some other minifigs besides Asokha and Anakin.  I'd really like to see another Jedi like Aayla Secura or Kit Fisto, given that they are on the show.

"Dentarthurdent","2009-03-05T22:30:51.623Z","Very nice...anyone for seconds?","I must personally admit that I purchased this set largely due to the inclusion of Anakin Skywalker. The Hutlet too is a welcome addition. The bug- eyes and brown hairpiece make Anakin a remarkable minifig, especially in comparison to the old Anakin who looked more or less like an ordinary civilian gone mad - a plain, yellow head, black dots for eyes, a common hairpiece and of course that brown cape which gives him that delirious look of lunacy.

However, Anakin is not the only reason for this set's score of 5. The AT-TE is very well designed - there are a number of seats to place your clone troopers (or Jedi), both at the rear and the front, and you can easily place and remove them from the inside of the AT-TE courtesy of the detachable holders.  There is also a cockpit sort of thing at the front. The legs are sturdy - nothing to complain about. These together with the sheer size of the thing give it a highly impressive appearance. 

I highly recommend this set to you even if already have one - it's a perfect means by which to build your army - of course, you will require troopers to fill it, most efficiently obtained via the battle packs.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

  Ok I have to say this is a great set. It goes great if you have a Trade federation Mtt. It comes with the only existing Captain Rex! here are some pros and cons:

               pros:
                 Captain Rex
                 STAP viechle for droid
                 Anakin (Clone Wars)
                Ahsoka with herf  head piece
                clone trooper 
                     Rotta
                    2 missle launchers that are hidden
                 Big turret on top looks gret
                Cockpit mechanism is awesome
                comes with Arc gear
              
  Now for the Cons:
               Could come with another clone or two
               The four guns in front and two in back often come off
              handle barely works
               stickers( not a con for me but may be for some people)

                  thats it. It is a great set I would get before it goes out of stock.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"spartanlee","2009-04-30T17:23:04.45Z","awesome","this set is amazing. it comes with good minifigs even though i don't like the new clone wars figures. it took me around a day or two to build and i liked every minute of it. nothing ever broke off of this set for me

Pros:
huge
really cool hidden missles
STAP(it looks like it has wings)
rare minifigs(like rex and rotta)
good playability

Cons:
not enough clones (you have to choose whether you want him in the cockpit or turret. and why have six seats if only a couple of the minifigs can fit in them?)
the sticker was missing for the STAP (i may have thrown it out with the box)
the inside is visible from where the middle legs are attached ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-10-12T22:58:11.793Z","The might of the Republic vs a puny little STAP. Hmmm...","I think is even better than the old one. Lets get into pros and cons:

Pros:
Nice cannon function
Removable cockpit interior
Turret
Awesome Minifigs
Front and back leg system
Seating platforms
STAP

Cons:
Middle legs can't always reach the ground
Middle feels somehow exposed
Back hatch is too small
Weird thing that fits in the middle (I have no idea what it is).

This set's pros destroy it's cons, so that is good enough to give it a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Joshua_Stevens","2009-05-20T14:56:37.89Z","Very good","I really like the AT-TE, this one too me was'nt near as good as the old one but it still is very enjoyable.

Pros:

Lots of nice bley/light grey parts.

Round disk shape pieces.

Very playable and poseable.

STAP flyer.
-----
Cons:

Barely any greebly details, lots of stickers few printed pieces.

Only one clone trooper one commander? what the heck isn't this a Republic attack walker?

Not too much room in the cockpit.

Overall 3/5
To me it really didn't really make the cut for a high-end lego set, 90$?
You'd think there would be more detail.

"shinjix2","2009-05-09T11:57:17.36Z","Very enjoyable!","Just spent the last 3-1/2 hours building this set I I found the end product to be one of my most liked set. I was getting frustrated because I had more Sepretist figures and vehicles than I do Republic. Mainly because the Droid sets are far cheaper. Well I found this one on sale for $85 and picked it up. 

The build was enjoyable, the legs were  monotonous but other than that, each step offered something new. So to the pros and cons:

Pros:
Not all graphics were sticker, A nice change.
Two actual cannons, not this flick fire stuff.
Set is sturdy!!
Extra droid and STAP

Cons:
Need more minifigs/clones
The feet are free moving to the point they can't hold a position
Center Feet are the same way.

I would suggest getting this set if the opportunity arises",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
-The walker is big, and cool looking.
-The STAP is very good. I hope we see these in more sets sometime soon.
-The minifigs are pretty good, with and (I believe) exclusive Captain Rex.
-It can be picked up by the dropship (I don't have it though)

Cons:
-Stickers (I don't mind much but many fans do.)

PROS :)
.Anikan,my first Anikan Minifigure and a great blue lightsaber.

.Ashoka,i like this minifigure and the little  thing she wears around her head and a nice green lightsaber.
.Rex,he is a great minifigure and rare minifigure (if you don't have the exclusive Comic Con set) and his helmet is great,but why is he wearing a visor in the picture?

.Rotta,an adorable minifigure and he is even more cute on the big screen,and the Lego manual lists him as one piece but he is really three piece's (his two arms attach into him).

.STAP,i own the 2007 droid battle pack STAP,but the one in this set is more advanced with those T shaped pieces that the wings clip,onto and those blue studs.

.AT-TE,this is a good walker,the feet,the chairs for the passengers,the rockets,the gun on top,the pilot cockpit,the guns,the opening tops,this is such a great walker,and if anyone wonders what that thing that comes out the middle of the walker,that is for the LAAT/e and AT-OT 

CONS :(
.If a piece is not put into place near the pilot  cockpit it is going to be hard getting it back in
.The legs for the AT-TE take a long time to build.      Thanks for reading :)

"captain_radda_radda","2009-10-04T21:31:16.577Z","1 Year Later...","Well, today was the one year aneversery of my At-Te. This was my first clone wars set. Recently, I've compared it to the newer clone wars legos and heres what came up:

How it stands up compared to Wave 2 and Wave 3:
Its definately big
Less features
Good amount of figs
Exclusive Cpt. Rex
One of the very few spring loaded missle sets
Accurate color sceme
A remake that accatually made the origanal look bad

Whats it doing now:
Well the At-te is now only available at Toys R Us for $100
Its still one of the best vehicles out there
A LOT bigger than most $90 sets out right now

Final thoughts:
Just thought I'd share my observations with you guys. This is definately one of the best Lego investments ever. Get it before it fades away completely! I look back now and see that this is definately a 5 star set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"TransformR","2010-01-17T15:19:58.623Z","Great, but with a minor missle malfunction","Overall, I love this set. It is stable, commanding, and they planned ahead with the hook to attach to the Republic Dropship.

Now on to the review
Pros:
huge
sturdy
can link with Dropship!
Cons:
Missles will not fire, I am unsure if I built something wrongor what; but what i push the cannons back the missles just move back too

young builders might need help making the legs right

set and i would buy this instead of the republic gunship if you want my advice.

"bobbythefish123","2009-11-13T18:53:41.06Z","great set","I got this set with my birthday money and I was not disappointed. It comes with excellent play features, and an okay selection of minifigs.

Walker- Good size, top gun rotates all the way around. It can normally seat 8, but i modified mine to seat 16. It has good pieces, and is easy to modify to make better seating and maybe other small vehicles. Interior is big, and pilot area slides out to reveal controls. It is a little bigger than the MTT, and is 10 dollars cheaper, so it is a good deal if you are looking for a big set. Ball turrets work well, and the missiles shoot very far( though they sometimes get stuck and have to be reset manually. 

STAP- not much to say. It has good design, but the clear piece that holds it to the ground often pulls of the whole lower part of it. It makes an okay side part to the set.

Minifigs- okay. Nice captain rex fig, and the jedi are nice to have, but why does it need a rotta the hut? I hate that thing. It has no use on the battlefield and was never in an AT-TE! It is just worthless. The droid is nice. There should have been more clones, though. It should have included 4 clones, so you could drive it, man the main gun, and put some guys in the inside of it. If lego had just added 2 more clones and 2 more droids to oppose it, they could have bumped the price up to 100 dollars.

overall, good value for money, good size, okay minifigs, and a fun build with many large pieces. Definitely get one. I may be getting another one of these, mainly because of the walker itself, not the STAP or minifigs. It makes a good centerpiece for a battle, and is the largest land vehicle I have in my arsenal.

"chavez247","2010-01-05T11:40:15.373Z","A Monstrosity of a Set!","Okay, let me get this straight: this thing is HUGE! It must make the droids freak out! It`s very large, has lots of firepower and comes with some good figures.
Figures: Captain Rex is fantastic. He has a mixed color scheme of blue and yellow, and looks just great. Anakin is pretty cool, and then we have Ahsoka Tano, his padawan. She`s a good minifigure, and reminds me a bit of an orange Shaak Tii(a figure I think should be made). There`s a clone, a droid, and Rotta, who despite being useless is pretty cute.
AT-TE: Huge. This thing is awesome! It has lots of guns and plenty of room for clones hitching a ride, as well as the giant(and awesome) cannon. Looks great and is really big, and is just all-around awesome. Sadly, one of the pieces is missing, so my cockpit is kind of shaky. Still fantastic, though.
STAP: A small vehicle, but a nice one. It`s blue, and looks much better than the STAP in the Droid Battle Pack. A few guns and two small wings finish it off.
One thing that bothers me is that there is only one clone who can mantain the AT-TE. This set should come with at least three more clones: one for the cannon and two for fighting droids. Some more baddies would be nice, too.
Pros:
Cool figures
Rex is amazing
Lots of guns
Cannon
Nice STAP
AT-TE looks great

More clones and droids

"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-17T14:26:19.717Z","A good-looking AT-TE stomps on those pesky droids already!","I do in fact like this set alot! Though it will break sometimes, that's LEGO for everyone. It's very large, and includes an exclusive minifigure: Captain Rex. And his head is different from the rest of the Clone Troopers'. Here are some pros and cons on this set:

Pros: 
1. Beautiful detail, inside and out!
2. Stays up when you want it too (Unlike most Star Wars walkers)
3. Great minifigures, and a STAP really increases playability
4. For piece and play-wise, good price
5. Works witht he Dropship

And for the cons that don't give this 5 stars:
1. The top hatch breaks alot! Then, it's hard to fix it (Annoying)
2. When this set breaks at all (Which it does), it is hard to repair, especially for younger children

Parents: If your child has recieved this, and is under 11, have someone help him. Build can be a little stressful and confusing, especially for younger children. This set also requires that pieces are locked very securely.
