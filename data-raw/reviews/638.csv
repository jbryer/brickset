I liked the simple design and &quot;hiding place.&quot; O, for the good old days of Legos. They should bring some of these classics back.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Now, for the review: A very cool set over all.  I really like how it includes a saddle so one of the guys can ride off into battle.  A sweat assortment of weapons; I have wanted one of those pitch forks for so long.  I also like the idea of hay, and the hiding place is cool.  To sum it up, this is a very good classic set.

The white horse pulls a wagon that seems to be ordinary hay, complete with a saddle (good for when the forestman needs to get on horseback) and all, but underneath all that's bland is a secret compartment where contraband can be hidden - the set comes complete with a few weapons for the hidey hole.

The downside is that the wagon seems rather blah otherwise, with the blue sides that detracts from the design - it could have been made better.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It have two wheels, and too a horse in the front, liking with a cart of the dragon knights. The minifigures are cool, with green parts and hats. In this set are included a sword and a whip, that can be putted easy in a piece or in a minifigure. The cart have some blue and some black included, these are useful colors to any creations. The horse is white, too included in the western theme, is compatible to many minifigures, pieces or carts. The pieces of this set are all useful, with these, is easy to make another set or mix with others. The minifigures are forestmen, don't very included in sets. This, is a option for they, the set is next to be an army builder, of course, if you already have this minifigure style. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
