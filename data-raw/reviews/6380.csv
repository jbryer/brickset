"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-24T08:46:12.577Z","Much more improved","This set is bigger and better than the old version of the repubic gunship that came out in 2003. Although this comes with fewer minifigures it has many more pieces, counting up to 1034 pieces. It comes with 5 minifigures: Asaaj Ventress, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Plo Koon, a clone trooper, and commander cody. This set alsocome with a brown speeder for one of the minifigures. This includes many detail includeing 8 firing missles, a stand with controls for plo koon and obi-wan, and a bigger room in the Repblic Gunship for jedi to stand in. It also has some sort of chamber for one of the minifigures as well. Oveall, for $120, it is a must-buy considering that is the most wanted set currently on brickset! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ratchetizer123","2008-07-26T14:34:47.14Z","A nice improvement over the first.","i picked this up and was just amazed and the size of the box. i now the set would be big. i got to building it and i found that the build is more difficult considering i had to open every bag to just build the mini-figs. after that it took me 4 hours to build and sticker it up.


Pros-
nice size
a chance to get one if u missed the first republic gunship
new minifigures
tons of little gadgets for the clone.
new jedis



cons-
price. $120 dollars is a lot but worth it.
lack of clones. i would have like to have at least 4 clones and then some.
finally the last part is the build. it tooke me a long time to build this and finding little pieces.



if u want to get this set it is well worth the money. i high suggest that u pick this set up.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Da_LegoBuilder","2008-07-28T13:32:27.997Z","&quot;A perimeter around the survivors create.&quot; -Master Yoda","This quote was said by master yoda on genosis the first time you see these awesome gunships into action. Very different than the first one, and a little bit better, read to find out!

Now look at the picture on brickset, now look at the sticker in the pict. The sticker is NOT the same. Its hard to describe but on the real set it looks like a tiger dropping a bomb. Oh well, this picture can't be perfect! 

The minifigs are Ventress, Kenobi (clone wars style w/clone trooper armor) PLO KOON! Commander Cody, clone trooper. Commander cody has the same equipment as Fox, so only difference is the color. In his helmet, small holes are seen to stick in the following acessories: (Kama, pauldron, binoculars, antenna, and thing to identiy rank.)

This set is bigger, better, and i bet fastr and stronger! the new plo koon minifig is like a kit fisto, but the head is much bigger! Instead of those laser beam turrets coming out from the side, they replaced it with a bacta tank! Why?! the turrets were so much better right?. you could see it in the picture, its circular and it is right behing the sticker. Where the sticker is, you can pull up that door and you can take out this small temporary command post. the sidedoors or &quot;blast&quot; doors can slide open or slide closed, you can decide. in the landing area it doesn't have those black things hanging down so anyone can hold on to it. If you open the rear compartment, you can find the speeder bike! Yes, finally somewhere to store that! It is cooler, its brown, and sorta looks like a mix of an Endor speeder bike and the old speeder bike in the old republic gunship set. right above where the bike is stored, there is a turret, or a tail gunner. Not a place to put a minifig, but a gun like in ep.2 that you see briefly. On the top where the two large engines are, there is flick firing missles, No! These are the new ones, so they will not fall out. Maybe the minifigs, because there is not really a firm spot to place them. Right next to those firing missles is a compartment that opens up to reveal a small radar, never seen the piont of that. The cockpit can open up like the ARC 170 style. 

Pros:
-Minifigs! The new ones! practically all of them!
-way more stuff to do with this one! Read from top of review to bottom to see what i am talking about
-bigger than the old gunship! 
(This is a short summary of the pros)

Cons:
-They got rid of the side laser turrets!! No...!
-And they replaced it with a bacta tank...tsk, tsk.
-only 1 clone trooper to fly a gunship which is carying YOUR commander and 2 jedi! hmm. Replace it with 2 clone pilots. 
-These things are supposed to drop off AT-TEs, why can't we connect it with the new one and&quot;drop&quot; it off like in the movies.?
-They are supposed to drop off lots of clones, 2 jedi and a commander doesn't cut it buddy!
-Ventress, she should come with another set or at least have a transport of her own!

This set is a 5!! great terrific work, snatch these, because these WILL sell out, i am sure. It may be worth $120, but it is worth it!

My the Brick be with you!!

"EL_Mo","2008-08-05T12:56:52.263Z","Excellent, but not flawless."," So, I ordered this set a few days after it came out. I didn't get it until yesterday, so here is my review:

  The box to the actual set was is very large and heavy.  It's your basic box, nothing special.  After I opened the box and finished dumping out all the little bags, I realized that they weren't numbered! And after looking through them, I had to open virtually every bag just to make the minifigs!  And it only got worse from there.  Throughout the build, you constantly have to search for identical pieces that come from different bags.  But in the end it is worth the searching.

  When I finished, I just couldn't stop staring at its size. I mean this thing is huge!  Lots bigger than the previous version I have heard. I also realized I had an extra bag of ARC gear! SWEET! All minifigs have a place to stand/sit in the ship.  I even threw in yoda.
But again I will say there are flaws.

  As for the turrents, the earlier model had the design right.  There are supposed to be some on the side and people aren't supposed to sit in the wing bubbles, according to a cross-section in a book.  The bacta tank is cool at first glance, but when you build it, it is lopsided and the clear pieces don't line up. The lack of clones is pitiful, theres hardly enough to even fly the thing! But, the quality of the figures almost makes up for it.  Also many things fall off easily including the front turrets and the windsheilds for the cockpits.  So lets go to some pros and cons:

+Pros:
+Cool minifigs.
+Very large.
+Cool stickers.
+Nice flick-fire missiles.
+Fun build.

-Cons:
-Fragile.
-Some stickers attatch to more than one piece.
-Needs more minifigs!
-The price:$120! I'm not buying any more Legos in a while!

Overall, this is a good set and deserves an 8.5 out of 10.

"yankeeken","2008-07-31T00:58:17.437Z","7676: Republic Attack Gunship Review","Build: The build for this set is fairly simple and straight forward. However it is longer than most other builds and can be tedious at times. The instructions did a nice job of separating the build into 6 main parts, body, doors, front, cockpit, top and wings. I was fairly surprised to find out, when I opened the box, that the set comes with two booklets of instructions. At first I thought that they accidentally put two booklets in my box until I took a closer look and saw that they were clearly marked with a 1 or 2, corresponding to which booklet was to be used first.

Parts: Lots of good slopes and white pieces, which can easily be used to make a custom republic vehicle. The dark red and lime green pieces are also nice, due to the fact that they are sometimes hard to find. The extra Assaj's lightsabers and the extra clone accessories bag was also a nice touch, something that I found rather surprising actually. My only complaint is the fact that you don't get an extra set of bubble turrets, so it is a bit harder to MOD the Gunship to include side bubble turret, like the original. But hey, you can't ask for everything now can you?

Minifigs: Commander Cody and the regular clone look a lot better than I expected. Their helmets, even torsos to a certain extent, are a lot more detailed than past clones. They also look great with all of the Clone Commander/ARC equipment that they come with, flood light, visor, antenna, kama, and pauldron. However, I found it a bit odd that the heads underneath their helmets looked more like Anakin than Jango Fett. Plo Koon, whose head is rubber like Kit Fisto's, was also a surprise to me. From pictures that I had seen before I bought the set, his head looked a to skinny and disproportional. But I must say, he looks a lot better in person. Assaj Ventress like the other minifigs is very detailed, especially her curved lightsaber hilts. She even comes with her signature dress, not sure the technical name of it, which is a piece of fabric put on in a similar fashion as a cape, but instead is put on between here legs and torso. Obi-Wan would probably have to be my least favorite of the minfigs in this set. Although his torso is very detailed, his face looks a bit odd.

Detail: This RGS is much more detailed and bigger than the original one. Unlike the original one, this ones bay doors actually close completely. Plus the two cannons in the front and the one in the rear are bigger and more proportional than the original. My only real complaint is abundance of stickers in replace of printed pieces. So far the only stickers that I have applied are the two republic symbols, one on each side of the ship, and the console on the little command center. And I must say that even with out the majority of the stickers, this set looks great, so those that absolutely hate stickers should be able to do just fine with out them.

Playability: This set is fairly durable and easy to swoosh, however a word of advice is to be careful when picking it up for the first time after building. Even though it is not terribly heavy, it was heavier than I expected. Also be careful of where you hold it from as it can sometimes break if you hold it from the wrong place. Its cargo/crew bay is fairly big and can easily hold more than 6 troops plus the speeder bike. The speeder bike is by far the best one ever, it brilliantly uses the back of one of the old three wheel motorcycles that LEGO used to make. Although it does move round and make a little bit of noise, for the most part it fits in the back fairly well. The little exploration pod/command center, stored in the nose of the ship, is better than the original as it is detachable from the Gunship. Where as in the original one, it was built into the nose and required opening the front of the Gunship in half to gain access. The bacta tank stored in the nose of the ship, a little bit behind the command center, fits into its slot very nicely and doesn't fall out while you're swooshing the RGS around. However I would have rather had a weapons storage area, side bubble turrets or even a bigger cargo area, than the bacta tank. The two spy droids that are stored in a hidden compartment on the top of the ship are a nice touch.

Price to Parts: I think $120 is a decent price for a set of this size, especially when it comes with 5 minfigs, all of which are brand new. However I would advise staying away from Toys R Us as they are selling this set, and all of the other sets, for a full $10 more at $130.

Availability: It is fairly easy to find in stores.

Conclusion: This is one of the best sets that I have gotten in a long time. I don't think that I have been this pleased with a set, other than the battlepacks, since Imperial Inspection. In my opinion, it is much better than the original RGS. I would recommend this set to everyone, especially if they didn't get the original RGS.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Pegasi","2008-08-30T10:44:25.483Z","Send in the Clones! Clones? Hello...? Where are you?","When I saw the images for this set back in February (?) I was drooling over the idea of another LAAT. The original one, released in '02 has to be one of the greatest Star Wars sets ever released. And I have to say, Lego has far and away topped that with this one. 

With a nudge over a thousand pieces and a bit over an hour of building, this is one of the more significant of the affordable sets that's been released this year. When I finished it, I noticed that the quality had been improved so much. They corrected the engines on the top, added bubble turrets onto the wings which actually seat clones in them, and, in my opinion the most important new feature, they slanted the doors on the side and made them air-tight.
Although I'm not going to be able to reference details from it as I can for other sets, due to the fact I haven't seen the most recent of the movies, it does capture the LAAT or &quot;Republic Gunship&quot; quite well. With the rather triumphant return of the phase I clones, I have to say I can't wait to get more of them. The Bacta tank is an.. interesting detail, 'though LAAT's weren't exactly known to carry them, and 2 &quot;drones&quot;, for lack of a better word can be deployed from a compartment in the top of the craft.

The minifigures, however few of them, are rather interesting. Commander Cody (:D) and his sidekick (&quot;Bob&quot;) appear in this set with nicely detailed armour and a large variety of accessories. Obi Wan, although he doesn't look to be in his happiest state, gives us another nice hair piece, and &quot;Asajj Ventress&quot; is another one, with nice printings, but a rather annoyingly made cloth skirt.

The accessories that come with the clones are something I've been looking forward too for a while now. The set comes with 2 visor's, 2 neck pauldrons, and some armour, as well as several antennae and some other strange... things. However, when all of the accessories that are meant to be applied to Cody are, I have to say he looks rather too cluttered. I quickly took of the armour pieces and just left him with the visor, which I still love. The antennae look pretty good on any random clone, but the V-19 pilot fits with them well.
I frankly don't have a clue what the other devices are supposed to be.. :p


Unfortunately, lego seems to have skimped out on some features. One of them, the bubble turrets mounted by the opening, can be MOC'd rather easily into it. But the main reason I knocked a point off, is the sheer lack of minifigures. I don't know if in the movie they set out with a malfuntion in the Cloning facilities and couldn't spare more than 2, or if lego's simply being stingy, but what with all the work they must have went to making these minifigures, I don't see why they couldn't have included more of them. I know that soon enough, what with the release of the fighter tank and clone walker battle pack just around the corner I'll probably be wishing they'd never included so many 'cause my droids will be overwhelmed, but it does seem rather odd to have a $120 set with just 5 minifigures.
The last thing, easily fixable, is that there's a large lack of space in the so called &quot;transport&quot;. the area that houses the speederbike takes up far too much room in the middle, and after all, this is meant to be a transport vehicle (Low Altitude Attack TRANSPORT) and I can barely fit 12 minifigures in a very uncomfortable state, let alone the roughly 30 or so (?) that it's meant to carry.


Ah well, I guess I'm complaining for no real reason. Lego has once again shrunk our wallets with the release of tons of sets that we all want. This is an absolutely amazing set, and if you, like me, already have plenty of minifigures I doubt that'll bug you so much. I would reccomend this to anyone that has enough money. That was my first review in quite some time, actually. Please don't lose it Brickset!

The ship itself is awesome, I love all the features but I wish it had the gun turrets on the sides of the cargo bay like the first one. The opening cargo bay doors are cool, and the storage compartments in the top come in handy for storing the ARC trooper gear that the clones can't wear (even from other sets).

When I got it I was literally skipping down the side walk to my van (although it was hard because the box was so big ). I had been saving up for this set since March  and was really relieved to get this it. The thing about this set is that it's kinda hard to handle but once you find the grips it's quite easy. There are so many features in set that it's worth the money. There are a few problems with this ship but they are overshadowed by the sets sheer size and nothings perfect anyway ( although this sure comes close ) and even though there is a major lack of clones it's a really awesome set.

"Lost_Cosmonaut","2008-08-25T14:42:27.857Z","One of the best I've had in years.","I have to admit, I'm only currently half-way through this set after approximately 3 hours of building last night on top of an hour of setup time.  This is one of the biggest sets I've built in ages and it was no let down.  My wife surprised me with it last night and once the baby was asleep I set to work.  Pulling all the bags of parts out was quite daunting!  But the build has been very satisfying so far.  My wife said it's the longest she's seen me work on a set ever!  Usually I can blow through a 400-500 piece set in about an hour.  She's glad this one is taking me awhile, she says it was &quot;worth the price&quot;.

Overall it's a great set.  The little extras for the Clone Troopers are great.  Some more Clone Troopers would have been much appreciated, however.  Especially some pilot-types for the cockpit rather than just a normal Clone.  The two different types of nose art is a great touch.  The build is very solid and I love all the closeable doors and flaps and hidey spots.  Very very cool stuff.

All in all this is a must buy, especially if you can get it on sale at Target.

"brick006","2008-10-23T02:00:09.983Z","The most anticipated set","This is probably the most anticipated set. Ive been wanting one since the movie. It looks better than the old one, but at the same time it is based off the Gunship from the clone wars series and not the one from episode 2. The differences are that it lacks bubble turrets on the sides, the sliding doors are diffent having an extra one on each side to completely conceal the passanger cargo. The extra door is just as easily removed however. A little more complex is changing the holes on the side of the ship to mimick the episode 2 gunship. In the new one instead of a slot on the side it has a bacta tank but with slight modifications you can put the slot back in. Otherwise this set look awesome, like the features, minifigs, speeder bike.

Pros:
-Looks great
- You know you want one
-Improvement over the old one
-Minifigs; Obi-Wan, Plo-koon, Asajj Ventress, Clone, Comander Cody
-Behind the plate with the &quot;monkey lizard&quot; is a compartment that stores a transportable command center
-Has a bacta tank just behind that for wounded lego people
-Toward the back the passanger cargo with sliding side doors and a loading ramp in the back
-Speeder bike loaded in the passanger cargo

Cons:
-Different from the original episode 2 gunship
-Stickers for people who hate them
-Minifigs are cartoonish

"Brickmeister1138","2008-08-21T23:11:02.123Z","The LAAT/i never looked so good.","I got this set on the day it was released. It is veryawesome and is very true to the gunships shown in the Clone Wars movie. It is considerably larger than the Ep. II version of the gunship, and is more true to the look than the origional version. The fold out panels are neat, although not in the Republic Gunship shown in Star Wars.

The speeder bike is nice, though I modded it quite heavily, and is far better than the origional speeder bikes in the origional Star Wars sets.

Overall I found this set to be very well made, but, as with most sets, had some problems.

Pros:
Two different nose art schemes
Cool Mini Figs
Accuracy to Star Wars Republic Gunship
Quite Big

Cons:
Far to few Clone Troopers
Somewhat flimsi in spots

"astrakhan","2008-12-18T15:10:59.7Z","One of the best sets ever","Figures: All in all, I built the Gunship in about eight hours split into two four-hour periods, and about fifteen minutes of that time was searching for all the little bits to make the minifigures. Plo Koon has his own rubbery head with neat pointy mandibles as part of his mask. Obi-Wan is pretty vanilla and has his blue lightsaber like Plo. Asajj Ventress has her special lightsabers and a soft goods skirt. My Gunship came with two bags of clone gear, though the instruction booklet only indicates one. There's no complaint from me, since each bag includes commander pistols, a kama, a pauldron, antennae, binoculars and some other sort of bullet-shaped headgear.

The Build: There's a lot of reinforcement in the build, a good thing considering that the final model is about a foot and a half long (two feet from the tip of the rear cannon). The entire ship is sturdy despite the various opening parts. Though it shoold hold together, I would suggest not picking the model up at the top and definitely not from the wings.  While there are some new pieces (to me, at least), there are also some rather old ones, such as the hinged boxes in front of the wings. I love the ball joints used for the three anti-personnel cannons. The speeder bike, bacta tank and command center are interesting, but not impressive, and I took them apart to add some more weapons on to the ship.

Gimmicks: Plenty and rather unobtrusive. Unlike some other ships, the Gunship isn't built around a launcher, so there's no issues with an obvious trigger. There are eight flick-fire rockets between the huge mass driver cannons. These should technically be on the underside of the wings and I've moved them there with a few extra pieces. Unlike the old Gunship, you can put troops in the wing turrets; this is probably to make up for the lack of side ball turrets. In place of those is the area for the bacta tank, which can hold a trooper. The Gunship has six opening doors: two at the front to hide the command center, two forward cargo bay doors, and two large rear cargo bay doors. The last open using a hooked Technic piece, so it's easy to open and close. The cargo bay also has a lowering ramp to let the speeder bike enter and exit. At the top of the cargo compartment are red, yellow and green bricks. While at first this seems to be an odd match, they appear to be an indicator for when the speeder bike can launch and return. A hatch on the top contains spy droids, the aforementioned hinged boxes hold extra antennae, guns and lightsabers, and though it's not a hatch technically, the rear engine details are on a panel that can flip up.

Verdict: I'm a proud AFOL and this is easily one of the best sets I've seen since I started collecting back in 1992. Though expensive, the Gunship is intricate, nicely gimmicked and very adaptable to extra weapons or gear. For fellow MOCers, there are lots of fortress-style pieces in this set, such as arches and sloping bricks, so a clone trooper base would be a good alternate model. You may want to pick this up soon: this is the kind of set that sells out before it can go on sale. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The republic Attack Gunship may possibly be one of the finest ever made lego star wars creations. The sheer size is amazing. So we'll start of with the minifigures:

Commander Cody: Basically a Normal Clone, except with orange arms and markings on his torso, and a Helmet with Orange stripes. Also Includes ARC Gear (4 Headlamps, 2 visors, 4 Antennas, 2 Pauldrons, 2 Kamas) and of course dual pistols. All the gear is still in grey, not yet black.
Clone: Nothing special, Just your usual clone.
Plo Koon: Includes a new Torso, and His head, made of about the same material as Kit Fisto's, is incredibly detailed. Comes with a Blue lightsaber.
Obi-Wan Kenobi: Also with a new torso, detailed, he has a kind of Manga-themed head, like the rest of the new released clone wars heads. The Hair, which seems odd at first, isn't even that bad. Made of the same normal lego material. Also includes a blue lightsaber.
Asajj Ventress: All pieces, except for the legs, on this minifigure are new. She has a skirt made out of some kind of stretchy cloth-like material, and two Brand new lightsaber hilts. Also includes 2 spares (4 Lightsaber hilts!)

The Accessories to the Ship:

Probe Droids: Nothing special, a small round droid.
Speederbike: Amazing. Probably the best ever lego star wars speeder. The base of the speeder is actually the body of the original lego trikes. The speeder can be stored in the back of the gunship.
Bacta Tank: Not enough detail. It can be opened to put someone in side. In a cylindrical shape. Is placed at the middle of the gunship.
Command Pod: rather small, space for 2 people, with a little switch in the middle and controls. Is stored at the front of the gunship, behind the kowakian monkey lizard or the Twilek dancer.

The Actual Ship:

An Amazing piece of lego craftsmanship. Let's start at the front: Two rotating laser cannons. The Cockpit with covers that fold up, but not very well. Underneath is the hidden command pod and the bacta tank. You can chose from two different Artwork designs for the sides at the front. In the middle we have a slot on the roof where you can store the probe droids and 4 compartments to store spare ARC gear. At the bottom is the actual ""bay"", the main part of this gunship. There are two doors on each side, one opening towards the front, the other to the back; with in interesting mechanism which lets you open both back doors at once. Speeder and Jedi/Clones are placed here, and you have ""clips"" to put your spare guns or lightsaber blades onto. At the back, we have another laser cannon, identical to the two at the front. There is also a hatch that leads to the troop bay, through which the speeder can exit the gunship. On the top, 4 flick-fire missiles on either side, and a hatch on each wing, where you can also seat a clone trooper, unlike the original gunship.

Pros:
-3 new Sith & Jedi
-2 sets of ARC gear and 2 spare lightsaber hilts
-A Awesome speeder
-a bacta tank
-Commander Cody
-2 different artwork designs
-Amazing detail
-very sturdy

Cons:
-The hatches of the cockpit do not open and close well enough
-Nothing! ( some people would say lack of clones, but Battlepacks will change that)

So, once again, I must say, The probably the finest piece of work lego has ever made for star wars. And so many new minifigures! It is amazingly detailed and has only one flaw! I must say: Lego at its finest. 5/5

Big. Very big

Two exclusive minifigures that are still not available anywhere else

New pieces also unavailable now (Asajj's llightsaber hilts and skirt)

Price value is not as good as compared to vehicles such as the Venator which is bigger and has more money value

One of the first sets to feature the capsule escape pod design

How it stands up to the rest of the Star Wars Universe:

<p>The overwhelming size and weight of the box clues you in on just how big of a set it really is, as will the 10+ bags of bricks you'll pull out to start building. Finding pieces is also harder than the standard $50 set, so organizing could be recommended, although I find straightforward building a bit more productive. For me, it was about a 7 and 1/2 hours of build time, and it was rather basic with few Technic pieces.</p>
<p>Although the selection of minifigures is underwhelming compared to how many this Gunship can hold, the figures were definately worth it and I doubt the lack of figures will make it hard for you to fill it up as I did. Nearly all the figures are exclusive to the set or are elsewise extremely hard to find, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, Plo Koon, Asajj Ventress, Commander Cody, and one ordinary Clone Trooper.</p>
<p>Inside the Gunship itself, there are 4 positions to be manned by your troops: two cockpits and two wing guns.&nbsp; Inside the troop bay of the Gunship there's room for about 15 using some creative placement of troops, plus some sitting room along the doors for a true Episode II feel. There's also a pull out commander center and a bacta tank, all which the Gunship holds internally. Also you have a Probe Droid hatch and you're equipped with 8 flick fire missles, and a removable speeder bike that&nbsp;fits in the troop bay.&nbsp;Yes, all that and the 7 mounted guns are ready for you to start an invasion with.</p>
<p>Alongside all these features, the Gunship is a fairly sturdy set. Only problems to think about are the front gun pods, whose design is albeit neat and well thought out, is a tad flimsy but livable. The Gunship itself is a very tall and thick set, sure to be the centerpiece of your collection (I know it's mine!!) so obviously if you're like me you probably don't have $120 to throw around for a set like this, but take a chance on this one. It's the best!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

It includes great features such as a command center, speeder bike, fire-flick missles, a compartment of spy droids, a backa tank (for wounded soldiers) and much more. The cockpits are great and do not need to be snapped off like many other ships. The bubble turrents have a great design and are printed on (that would be a hard sticker to put on). The backa tank is firmly put into the ship and never falls out. Inside the gunship there is a blaster rack (for guns), a lane for the speeder to go in and some room for clones. The stickers can be a pain and are very hard to center in areas. Take your time with them. The figures that come with this set are: assaji ventress, plo koon, obi wan kenobi, commander cody and a standard clone trooper. This set is very durable almost everywhere. Watch that you don't break the cockpit area because its hard to re-build. Overall, this is a good lego set but not as good as the original.

"Phoenixfighter","2009-05-08T17:47:32.14Z","7676 Republic Attack Gunship","This set is so excellent that it couldn't get better. I can't remember but I'm pretty sure I bought this set. When I was looking for it I scored some assistance from my mum, she tried calling all the places we could think of, K-Mart, The Warehouse the lot. Except for one... We drove down to Toys R Us, our final option, and there, in a high shelf, was and angel... The Republic Attack Gunship. Because the box was quite high the sun was shinning on it making it look like an angel. Then came construction.

I'm not sure where to start so I'm going to choose them at random. Firstly, the command pod. The small area for the pod is just the right size, the pod slides in perfectly. I quite like the the command pod itself, the stickers make it look like a mini radio station. It would look pretty cool if lego people could fit inside the pod when it is inside the it's chamber. Another cool thing about the pod area is that there is an ark shaped piece in between the medical pod chamber and the command pod chamber to make it look like the mini figures could walk between the chambers if they were alive.

The Medical Pod. This pod is really cool, a great part of this set. The people fit so perfectly inside. I have seen a lot of people who take out the pod to add mods of some type. I just leave it how it is. The dome shaped pieces on the outside of the pod stick out to make it look like something other then a pod, which is good cover. The chamber for the medical pod is cool, the small ramped pieces on the inside hold the pod in place and the two flaps that hold the pod securely in place.

The Holding Bay. This is probably the main thing about this set, it is so roomy, fits lots of troops and comes with a all new speeder bike! I found that the speeder bike prevents you holding so many troops in the holding bay, so I took it out and replaced the floor with bigger pieces with heaps of studs so that I could put more troops into it. The blast doors are so smooth when the open, which makes it even better. The boarding ramp at the very back is pretty cool, I'm not sure what I should use it for now because I took out the speeder bike. I'm thinking of attaching it to the back of the boarding ramp. The little storage holds above the holding bay come in real handy, you can put unused commando gear inside or spare parts that may come in handy in the future.

The Cock Pit. I personally think that the cock pit has really good detail. the mini controls are cool, except they are stickers so sometimes when you pull the window things down they get peeled off. The window things are kind of a nuisance because they continuously snap off the pieces that hold them there. When I made the cock pit I decided that the front seat is for the pilot and the rear seat is for the dude that controls all the missiles and weapons. (front and back blasters). I also turns out that you put the long brown sticker on the front of the rear windscreen.

Probe Droid Chamber. This particular chamber is slightly strange, but it has no flaws. The probe droids look really cool, very simple but cool. I never knew that Republic Gunships even had probe droids. On the panel that opens to allow the probe droids to come out of, I added some dark red pieces to give it more detail. I was going to add a shield generator dome but I didn't have the right piece.

Rear Turret. At fist I thought you were supposed to put a guy into the small space under the flap, but it turns out you don't need to. The turret is really handy in case  you have a separatist on your tail. The sticker on that white flap is really annoying because if one of the corners loosens and a bit of dust sticks to the sticker... Your screwed. I ended up snapping the corners off with my pocket knife.

Missiles. They are pretty cool. Sometimes they slip out when you tilt the gunship forward.

Wings and Laser Domes. The wings are really good for adding detail, and stay on the hull really well. The laser domes are pretty awesome, if there were two more on the sides of the gunship it would look way cooler.

If you are on the fence about buying this set, just buy it! I'm sure you've heard this a million times but this is a great buy! You won't regret it.

"goldfish","2009-05-04T18:38:01.84Z","Excellent set ","I have just got this set, and as an older fan of lego (i.e. hang over from loving the films and Kenner toys in my youth), thought I would post a quick review more from the collector angle. 

Firstly, I think the model is beautiful, it's pretty movie accurate, and has nice touchs, such as the closing doors, design of the cockpits, medical chamber etc. I have read the occasional review that states the earlier 2002 version is better, but unfortunately I do not have that version and therefore cannot compare. Looking at pictures of the older version, the ship looks very very similar though. 

I also found the build entertaining without ever getting boring or frustrating in any way. 

Personally, I think the mini-figures are superb. There are three super new figures in Ventress, Kloon and Cody. The only downside from an authenticity side is the lack of clone troopers, i.e. one seems a bit tight, but given the aformentioned three unique new figures, as well as General Kenobi, then this is probably more of a minor quibble, and can be easily and cheaply addressed by getting one of the clone trooper battle packs for a tenner. 

As with all the Star Wars licenced items, you tend to pay a premium, probably linked to the licensing agreement? An example of the cost comparison issue is probably best shown by comparing this to a similar sized set out in another 2009 theme, i.e. Brickbeards Bounty from Pirates, which retails at £20 less with similar pieces and far more mini-figures. Anyway, in this case, and judged against other Star Wars sets, I think this is good value. 

The only thing that stops me giving a 5 is the fact that it has stickers. As a child (and even now really), I like it when you discover new printed bricks, but stickers feels a slightly lazy change for the modern times. Many collectors and fans constantly re-iterate this, so I am at a loss as to why Lego does not do more to address this. It's a minor point though overall in the context of an excellent set.  

Overall a triumph. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ShatteredGnome","2009-05-16T18:25:57.013Z","Deploy The Troops... What Troops? ","This set is quite simply amazing. Even though it's a bit expensive, it's well worth it. Oh, yeah. This is not the episode II gunship, hence the side ball turrets being replaced with the new wing turrets; the clone wars updated style.<br><br>Hold: The holding bay is different than it first appears. The speeder is stored on a 'rack' in the center, where four blasters can also be stored, and the sides where people stand cut off in the forward center, leading to an open arch where the bacta tank can be seen. If you take the speeder out and modify center, you can fit an army inside.<br><br>Cockpits/Hatches: There are two cockpits in front that seat 1 man in each, and 2 gunner turrets on the sides that open; actually seat a fig this time. There are two side flaps that raise so the bacta tank can come out, as well as te two panels in front that house the command station. a back hatch lowers to release the speeder, and an upper back hatch reveals a large, empty space. If you have a few extra jedi, they fit in it. And lastly, the hatch above the cockpits can fit the two recon droids and lightsabers. Storage lockers on the sides house the ARC gear. <br><br>Weapons: Definite improvement. The guns are bigger and more proportional, and the flick fire missile rack works well. <br><br>Minifigs: Ventress is definitely unique and rare, as well as Plo Koon. For the time being, the only set with Obi-Wan(Until Pirate Tank) and Commander Cody is cool too. The one flaw is the clones. Only one clone, however not a problem; just grab a few battle packs and you're set.<br><br>Almost perfect; one of my favorites.<br>Overall 9/10. ",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

Lego 7676 Republic Attack Gunship may be forgotton by many now, but it is probably one of the best Starwars vehicle produced by Lego so far, I am not going to repeat the features here as you must already known about them or read about those somewhere many times, I just like to point out a few of my observations:

1. Republic Attack Gunship may be the Starwars clone wars vehicle with the most exposures, and it is really beautiful. The Lego implementation reproduced the movie details to its best

- Opening cabin door, compartment for command station and healing chamber 
- Two seats camel style pilot cabin
- Compartment can carry combat units and a speeder bike, and there is a backdoor for entry

2. It is a vehicle with much flexibility and playability. Positionable cannons, missiles, flexible wings, combat chamber on wings.

3. The minifigs mix is great, with the passion of Lego Starwar fans, never would be a set be good enough in that aspect. But remember, this is the only set that gives you Ventress. And you also get Obi-Wan Kenobi and Plo Koon.

Talking about Ventress, despite being a villain, she is a fascinating character and one of the most fearsome nemesis of the good jedi clan, without her, wouldn't the war be less fun?

minifigs:

Obi-Wan (rare)
Commander Cody (exclusive to this set)
Asajj Ventress (exclusive to this set)
Plo Koon (exclusive to this set)

Pros:
great rare minifigures

its pretty darn big, the measurement says 14 inches long, but i measured it myself and it was closer to 17 inches long.

everything in this ship does something (control center, bacta tank, speeder bike, sliding doors, many cockpits, storage,)

great for modding

its just plain good looking

solid, doesnt fall apart often

+Extra front doors so you can have the Twi-lek or Jabba's Space Monkey
+Flick missiles (8!)

+4 holders for guns inside the ship
+The two little storage compartments on either side (my daughter insists Asajj's skirt be stored there!)

Cons (more nit-picking than anything else)
+For the price, wish they had a couple more clones and/or battle droids
+Cockpit windows/hatches come off all the time when they are opened
+Hold from the bottom when ""flying"", else it'll break off a bit

"Zacherano","2010-02-07T21:08:44.683Z","Fantastic Design; Impressive, Minute Details","Before purchasing this set almost the day it came out on S@H, I had been researching its beautiful design and minifigures for weeks in great anticipation.  I missed out on the original gunship, like many who bought this version, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of this set in general. The building experience was great; it gave me a lot of intriguing new pieces, and I lappreciate all the little features like the speeder and the seating areas for minifigures in the wings on either side. The flick-fire missiles work incredibly well - I have perfected the art of launching several successfully at one time.

Probably one of my only problems with this set are actually the minifigures, which I customarily anticipate highly in a set of this nature. I do not much like the new Obi-Wan design - my RotS Kenobi minfigure is much better; however, it does look just like the Clone Wars movie and TV episodes. Sith assassin Asajj Ventress (pronounced Ash-I for those of you who do not know) is fairly intriguing, with the rare skirt, but the new lightsaber hilts render it challenging to form into a double saber, as the construction and placement is quite precarious. I do, however, like how Lego included two extra Ventress saber hilts.  I wish Lego included more troopers and Jedi, but I do like Cody and our favorite mask-wearing Jedi Master, Plo Koon of the Jedi council, who was killed on Cato Neimoidia in the era of Order 66.

I am rambling on a bit, so I will bring this review to a close: the set is truly phenomenal, so I recommend it to any Star Wars or Lego fan: just ensure that you have some other sets and Star Wars minfigures (Jedi, clone troopers, droids) to supplement the gunship, since it has space for about 15 extra clone troopers and Jedi.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"StarWarsCastlefan","2011-08-01T16:51:44.65Z","Attack of the Clones!","<p>I recieved the Republic Attack Gunship two years ago at Christmas, and finally managed to review it, so here it is (it's long):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Build: It takes a while, considering this is over 1000 pieces, but it certainly is a pleasant way to spend a good chunk of your day. The main frame involves a mix of Technic and regular building techniques; it is rather fun to watch as the skeleton of the ship slowly transforms into the actual thing. My biggest suggestion is to sort out the pieces before you begin, as none of the bags are numbered, and it can be rather hard to find specific pieces within a hodgepodge of parts. You should be a decent builder to do this; the youngest builders may want some help. The bike is also very nice; what I especially like is that it fits nicely inside the ship. The control panel and bacta tank complement everything else, and add to the playability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts: There are plenty of&nbsp;neat parts I've never had before, such as the specific cockpit windows for the pilot's seats, or the bubble turrets for the wings. There are also plenty of regular stock parts in diffrent colors that are great to have, such as the lime-green colored bricks. The only thing I'd wish they'd done was print the pieces that had stickers on them...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigures: The figures in this set are very nice. This version of Asajj Ventress is exclusive to this set. (not counting the magnet set) Commander Cody is as well, and Plo Koon and Obi Wan (Clone Wars) are rare. The clone trooper is fairly standard; the only&nbsp;complaint I have is that at least one more clone should have been included in a set of this size. There's nice detailing on all, Plo has a rubber head, and Cody comes with ARC gear. Lightsabers included for both Jedi and for Ventress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability: It's excellent. It's very good for just making up random Clone Wars stories, or just swooshing around, though I advise you hold the ship on the bottom. From the top, the bricks tend to pull apart; the ship then falls and breaks, which of course means a rebuild. The figures mesh well with other Clone Wars sets; this ship does well if being used for army building. Of course, it also looks very nice on display too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for Money: No complaints, seeing as I got it as a gift. Generally though, one more clone would have been nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall: 5/5. A very nice job by the LEGO Company. This is definitely one of, if not,&nbsp;the best Clone Wars set out there.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"arl100","2012-09-23T13:11:51.367Z","Impressive wingspan, very good. ","<p>I have been wanting this set for a while, and seeing it going cheap I couldn't resist. It is a fantastic, highly detailed sets. One of the good 'Jewels in the Crown' of Lego, such as the new MTT. As with the MTT, the Republic Gunship is a vast improvement on its predecessor, with clearly a lot more thought being put into this both as&nbsp;a display piece and as a play model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The set, when built, certainly looks domineering. The opening doors are certainly a better feature than the empty space you had on the old gunship, and the model in general has been smartened up. The only 'serious' gripe with this set is a lack of figures, a&nbsp;clone pilot&nbsp;would have been great, as would have an extra trooper or two (not too much to ask since they put 20 battle droids with the MTT).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Very solid set, looks great as a display piece</li><li>Opening and closing doors are a great feature</li><li>Only time the 1st edition Asajj Ventress was released, making this a rare figure.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Lack of figures, pilot at least would have been good.</li><li></li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is cerainly a fantastic set to buy, and is still at a bearable price if picked up wisley on ebay. If you do buy it, you will not be disppointed with your purchase. Recommended for those with the modern MTT for a large battle scene or a general interest in the clone wars series.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"puCrepeaP","2013-01-12T17:24:14.503Z","Beast of a set","<p>Very nice set, with a lot of features.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>No complaints</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Good parts. &nbsp;I don't like it when sets use too many custom or&nbsp;specialty&nbsp;parts. &nbsp;This one avoids that for the most part, except for those big boosters, but what else you gonna do with that. &nbsp;Plus I don't know how custom those circle parts are.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Good minifigures. &nbsp;1 sith, 2 jedi, 2 clones. &nbsp;Not a bad set up. &nbsp;I know people rather have more clones to ride in the body, but without the bubble cannons I don't see it as necessary. &nbsp;I got two clones piloting the ship, good enough for me.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I really enjoyed the building experience with this ship. &nbsp;It wasn't repetitive, and was very thorough. &nbsp;Not dificult, but extensive and not too easy. &nbsp;I like that I didn't just fly through it. &nbsp;Sometimes when I build a set too fast, I feel as if I didn't get my money's worth. &nbsp;But this took me a good amount of time. &nbsp;The pieces all fit together nicely</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The best part about this ship is how sturdy it feels. &nbsp;This is one solid set. &nbsp;I know that I'd have a butt load of pieces to pick up if I dropped it, but carrying it around I feel like it is really well put together. &nbsp;Heavy, maybe my heaviest set. &nbsp;I love the features on this ship. &nbsp;The prison, the side doors, the rear ramp is amazing and the speeder that fits perfectly in the back, I LOVE that. &nbsp;The bubble cannons on the body would be cool, but I can't complain with the features just mentioned. &nbsp;Lots and lots of storage compartments. &nbsp;</p><p>The bad, the guns fall off sometimes. &nbsp;As does the cockpit. &nbsp;Lots of stickers on this set too. &nbsp;I usually don't mind, but the stickers are on a lot of pieces that are the same pieces in other areas. &nbsp;So when rebuilding I have to make sure whether the piece I'm using is supposed to be stickered or not.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Great set. &nbsp;Like I said, it's a beast. &nbsp;Big, Heavy, and sturdy. &nbsp;Lots or features, and compartments. &nbsp;A lot of fun. &nbsp;This is basic ally my ""tank"" of my star wars ships.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,3
"PooPotato","2014-03-27T01:16:12.4Z","Republic Sticker Gunship","<p>I should start this review out by saying this is hands down one of my favorite Star Wars vehicles of all time. &nbsp;I bought this set after coveting the already aging 7163 Republic Gunship for a couple of years, and when I saw the preliminary images I knew I had to get this set. &nbsp;After the first year of it being my absolute favorite set, I seemed to lose admiration for it, and now I am considering selling it to make more room on my shelves.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Considering this was the larges set I owned since I bought 10188 Death Star, the box was astronomical to me at the time. &nbsp;The instruction booklets were all rolled up, and I am glad that they put the big cardboard slab in between them now.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As you can tell, there are a ton of white pieces, and if you are a parts scavenger, there are a couple of dark red and lime pieces which seem to be pretty rare. &nbsp;I was disappointed with the use of bright red on the wings and cockpit though, as the ship in the film doesn&#39;t sport that color.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>When this set first came out, all of the minifigs were pretty rare, but they have all been thrown in with cheaper sets (with the exception of one), so none of them are that rare now.</p>

<p>Commander Cody appears here with orange markings on his chest armor and arms, with a dab of orange on his helmet. &nbsp;The printing was a bit off on mine, but it is hardly noticeable. &nbsp;He also came with a set of the aging ARC gear, with the inflexible kama (leg cape). &nbsp;A normal Clone Trooper also appears in this set, but it is quite disappointing that this figure was not a pilot. &nbsp;It always seems that with these large 2 seater aircraft, we only get 1 pilot! &nbsp;Luckily I have the V-19 Torrent and obtained another pilot as a gift, so the cockpits are full right now...</p>

<p>Plo Koon is a favorite of mine in that he looks entirely film accurate even though he appears in this Clone Wars set. &nbsp;The main issue I have with Clone Wars sets, (and soon to be &quot;Rebels&quot; sets), is that the minifigs never blend in with the other prequel sets I own, so I often banish the Clone Wars figures to a box while I display &quot;proper&quot; minifigs&nbsp;with the actual model. &nbsp;Plo Koon is alien enough that this isn&#39;t a problem, and he happily occupies my Battle of Geonosis&nbsp;diorama as of now.</p>

<p>Obi Wan was the main reason I tend to stay away from Clone Wars minifigs. &nbsp;His bright blue anime eyes haunt me to this day, and I quickly replaced his head and his orange comb-over with my 2005 Episode III Obi Wan head and cape. &nbsp;I understand that these minifigs are trying to be as accurate to the source material as possible, but considering the fact that none of the minifigs have noses, accuracy shouldn&#39;t be a main concern.</p>

<p>Asajj Ventress is the only minifig from this set that has stayed exclusive, only because of the cloth dress that she came with. &nbsp;I guess that makes her somewhat rare of a minifig, and could easily bring up the price of this set to any buyer. &nbsp;Her 2 lightsabers are curved, which is accurate and cool, and overall she is accurate to the comics and source material she came from.</p>

<p>According to Brickset the spy-droids are minifigs, so I guess I&#39;ll say something about them. Compared to other spy-droids, these are pretty average. &nbsp;You get 2 of them, and they just sit up in the compartment behind the cockpit. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me two days I think (I got it on a school night, gee whiz), and I recall loving every bit of it. &nbsp;It was really nice starting from the bottom up, and seeing my favorite Star Wars vehicle being built before my very eyes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Compared to the new Republic Gunship which has a carrying handle for easier playability, this one lacks a little in that department. &nbsp;If you don&#39;t hold the bottom of the ship while you carry the top, it is sure to split in 2 within a minute. &nbsp;The nose turrets always fall off, but I can&#39;t think of a better way to put them on. &nbsp;The lack of bubble turrets on the side really bugged me at first, but when I saw the Clone Wars movie I realized that this was a medevac version of the traditional LAAT/i, which is a little interesting. &nbsp;The cargo bay really bothered me, mostly because 80 percent of it was smooth, prohibiting my troops and Jedi&nbsp;from being crammed into it. This was solved by removing the speeder bike hook and blaster storage, and putting plates all over the inside. &nbsp;I should also mention that nearly every decal (there are tons of them!) on the Gunship&nbsp;has started to peel away horrendously. &nbsp;This should have no excuse really, as I have Episode III sets from 9 years ago that still have their decals intact and in place.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set was so amazing to me when I first got it, and with age it has decreased in luster to me. &nbsp;The flaws are starting to show, especially with the decals, and I now count the day where I can sell this one and purchase the new and film accurate version.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Great build</p>

<p>Good looking ship</p>

<p>Commander Cody, Plo&nbsp;Koon, and Asajj&nbsp;Ventress minifigs</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Very cheap sticker quality</p>

<p>Not entirely structurally stable.</p>

"Marce","2015-02-15T14:08:33.44Z","Ready for the attack General Kenobi!","<p>My dad bought me this set when I was turning 8 back in&nbsp;2009 (I&#39;m 13 now) and when he told me that this&nbsp;set was&nbsp;&nbsp;available at the store, I didn&#39;t know of which set he was talking about, but when he came home with the set, and gave it to me,&nbsp;I was greatly surprised&nbsp;by the thickness of the box and its length, but that&#39;s not all&nbsp;, I was happy because I finally got a Star Wars Episode II set, (which I later discovered that this set was from the Clone Wars Animated Series, and not from Episode II, but still, it counts as one) and when I saw the minifigures, I was happy to get some of them such as: Jedi Master Plo Koon, Assajj&nbsp;Ventress, well, her lightsaber&#39;s hilt actually, and my favorite: Commander Cody.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get started!!!!!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As I told you, the box its really big and thick, and if you&#39;re a box-keeper like me, you&#39;ll have to find a big spot for this one. The printings of the box are really nice and attractive,</p>

<p>they have a picture of the Gunship in the middle of a battle, and Obi Wan fighting Ventress, really cool!</p>

<p>At the back of the box you get several play features of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instruction booklets&nbsp;came in a really nice state, they&#39;re not rolled up or anything, they come in a flat form. They are really detailed and clear in the inside, &nbsp;that allows you to build the set quickly.</p>

<h3>Pieces</h3>

<p>The pieces are mostly white and gray, but there are some rare bright red pieces, and you too get some dark red pieces, and bright green pieces as well. All of them add up to a total&nbsp;of 1034 pieces.</p>

<p>I have no problem with the piece selection, just that awful bright red for the cockpit. (You never see that bright red &nbsp;cockpit in the movie)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>?The minifigures aren&#39;t a big deal, they are&nbsp;&nbsp;not the &quot;power&quot; of the set, but they are nice. You get 5 minifigures in total.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look!!</p>

<p>The Obi Wan Kenobi minifigure&nbsp;its not&nbsp;bad, but its not my favorite, considering that this is a Clone Wars version of Obi Wan, he gets different printing like the one we are used to see in the movies, he has like Clone Wars armor in his chest and white legs. No back printing :( &nbsp; &nbsp;He&#39;s got light-blue eyes and a deep orange beard as well as an orange hairpiece. This hairpiece is new. He comes with his trusty lightsaber.</p>

<p>Jedi Master Plo Koon is one of my favorite minifigures of the set. This is the first Plo Koon minifig&nbsp;that LEGO has ever made, and they made a really nice job on him. He has a rubber headmold, which is easier to manufacture, he&#39;s got really nice markings on his face. Nothing to special on his torso, just a normal brown jedi robe. He has dark brown legs. He comes with his lightsaber.</p>

<p>Assajj&nbsp;ventress is really cool. And what makes her look cooler its curved lightsaber hilts (she has 2 lightsabers) This minifigure has a really cool piece, her black, factory-made, skirt. That piece is really awesome and really durable. Cool minifigure.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time for&nbsp;my favorite figure: Commander Cody! He&#39;s a really cool minifigure! His printing is the same as a normal clone trooper, but with orange markings on it. He has a Clone Commando light gray&nbsp;armor, and a normal clone helmet with orange markings and some moving binoculars! His facemold&nbsp;is a clone normal facemold. He has 2 mini-blasters!</p>

<p>Last but not least, the clone trooper minifigure, I wish that LEGO had included a Clone pilot instead of this one, but I&#39;m not disappointed with this one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It took me 30 minutes to build this! (I&#39;m&nbsp;a really fast builder , you know!)</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This awesome set really amazed me, let&#39;s go withe cons and pros:</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p>You get 5 minifigures&nbsp;(Obi Wan Kenobi, Plo Koon, Assajj&nbsp;Ventress, Commander Cody, Clone trooper)</p>

<p>You get bubble turrets (oh! The return of bubble turrets!)</p>

<p>4 cockpits, 2 on the front, and 2 on the back</p>

<p>You get 4 sliding doors</p>

<p>you get space for storing weapons and&nbsp;accesories</p>

<p>8 flick fire missiles on top</p>

<p>opening doors at the front reveal a command station</p>

<p>really good color scheme</p>

<p>opening hatch on top for freeing probe droids</p>

<p>storage for a brown speederbike</p>

<p>CONS</p>

<p>The red cockpits on front</p>

<p>big and heavy ship, hard to fly</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

"Kaisermighe","2018-10-08T13:16:00.387Z","A milestone of TCW sets","<p>This is one of the most iconic and memorable sets of TCW subtheme. It was released in summer 2008, had 1034 pieces and included the Gunship, 5/7 minifigures and a speeder bike. Even though Lego has released a newer version of this vehicle in 2013 (as a remake of the Episode ii set of 2002), this one still is the more loved version.&nbsp;To me&nbsp;this set elude the concept of pros and cons, because it&#39;s so amazing that has character on his own. That&#39;s why i think this set needs to be looked at even today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have put my hands on these recently thanks to Bricklink, but new and misb&nbsp;his value have become very high. The build took me more than 2 hours and was very funny! Unfortunately it has an awful amount of stickers, but the main one in the front panel has an option, which is very funny and adds something of your own choice to his overall&nbsp;personality!</p>

<p>This is a custom Republic LAAT/i gunship, or Low altitude assault transport, a very common clone-wars-era vehicle used to drop infantry units from a cruiser to the ground. It also was heavy equipped to provide fire support to infantry and against other enemy ships in-atmosphere. It doesn&#39;t have the twin laser beams turrets on the sides, because after the Battle of Geonosis&nbsp;they needed more room for the sliding doors to fully close, so they get ride of them. So since it&#39;s a transport ship, main feature for Lego designers to accomplish is make a lot of&nbsp;room for troops, we&#39;ll see if that&#39;s achieved or not.</p>

<p>First off, there&#39;s&nbsp;a very good bundle of minifigures. All the characters in here will become much beloved in the show, and here they are at their very first appereance&nbsp;in a Lego set.&nbsp;There&#39;s &nbsp;Asajj Ventress&nbsp;as the solo villain, coupled with her unique cloth skirt (which is very durable) and her special&nbsp;twin red&nbsp;lightsabers.&nbsp;Obi-wan Kenobi&nbsp;with his now-classic tcw style suit, as it is for Plo Koon&nbsp;(with his&nbsp;rubber head with fragile print)&nbsp;and a single clone trooper. Special mention for Commander Cody, which here was coupled with a light grey&nbsp;set of equipments for ARC. With these comes also two little republic spy droids, which are nicely stored&nbsp;inside the ship. All in all the figures&nbsp;were not very accurate, but it was fun to have them all together. But being a gunship set, there&nbsp;could have been more, for sure, for instance a couple of clone pilots.</p>

<p>The gunship it&#39;s very big and looks cool on display!! But it&#39;s got also a lot of hidden playfunctions. First off, the weapons;&nbsp;there&#39;s a pair of chin-mounted laser cannon turrets on the front and one more on the very back, all of which of course could rotate pretty well. There&#39;s the missiles belt composed of 8 dark-grey flick-fire missiles&nbsp;on the dorsal surface on top, which could be slightly angled. Moving to the cockpits, there are two for the main pilots on the dorsal part, and two more for the gunners on the wings (has one each). The ones for the pilots fell off all the time, but the bubble ones on the wings are very nice and also printed pieces. There&#39;s also&nbsp;some hidden storage, like the command centre removable under the main sticker-panel in the front, which has room for two seated members. Also beside that there&#39;s a big bacta tank with the space to store a single minifig, then&nbsp;the spy droids hatch on top which could be raised to reveal them, and finally 4 caskets (2 on each flank) to store some little extra parts, like the ARC equipment. The windows to access to the inside (2 per side) open up very well, the little one manually but the bigger one with a technic piece on the back. The gap is minimal and the function is sturdy.&nbsp;As we mentioned before, the&nbsp;main part of the ship is the interior, which has room for some troopers in a thin line of studs per side, i could put some 10 minifigures&nbsp;at max. On the centre&nbsp;there&#39;s a brick with 4 clips to attach some weapons, and it also rest the speeder bike, which has his own hatch on the back which opens smoothly. Finally i just want to recall that the red bricks that are supposed to hold the wings fall off sometimes, but you can easly fix it using 2&nbsp;1X10&nbsp;bricks.</p>

<p>So overall i feel this is a tremendous&nbsp;set. Not is it just big and cool, but it&#39;s also packed with a lot of details, a lot of room for minifgures&nbsp;from pilots to passengers and in general a lot of fun! Swoosh it around it&#39;s difficult with the lacking of a handle, but altogether the build is very sturdy. It&#39;s meant to be a playset, and having all those functions it is, but to me it&#39;s more a display piece really.&nbsp;There are a lot of little flaws, like minifigures&nbsp;are not numerous or high quality ones, or main cockpits that opens badly, or the massive amount of stickers (some of which are good &#39;cause they give you&nbsp;options, but others are just lazy and some are even to be put in difficult little spots!), but again they are all little. It also gives you a lot of possibilities to customization, for instance just&nbsp;removing the clip/speeder holder inside to gain more room for passengers. For once, i actually think it was not overpriced for the amount of stuff that was included! The very first waves of TCW had good rrp sets, but this one was so beloved that over time it has increased its value becoming inaccessible brand-new. So a very successful&nbsp;set for the Star Wars line, definitely&nbsp;one of the best of the TCW subtheme, and i&#39;m proud to display it on my shelf even if it&#39;s from 10 years ago now!</p>
