"Legonater","2008-08-08T14:08:22.84Z","&quot;Roger Roger!&quot;","Awesome set! Just got this yesterday and boy am I surprised! It's double the size you'll think it is, and triple the fun! I love the bomb dropping mechanisim, and the idea to use the sides of the side lazers to keep the bombs in place is brilliant! A couple problems though:
1: I have found lately that the marking on the droids are incorrect. The officers have had whole yellow torsos instead of a strip on the torso and on their heads. The pilot, unfortunatly, is completely incorrect. It's toroso is supposed to have at least some blue on it. 
2: The cockpit doesn't have enough room for the 'pilot' to sit up. he has to lay down, nearly completely, to fit. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2008-08-12T23:11:27.64Z","Best value of the Clone Wars! ","PROS: 

- Excellent construction. The detail and sturdiness is outstanding. 

- Excellent build. It's satisfying, simple, and quick. 

- This is the only Clone Wars set to have a fair price-to-piece ratio.

- Three battle droids.

- Looks good on display.

- Easy on stickers.

CONS:

- The cannon on the front swings around too much.

- The bombs fall out when they're not supposed to. 

- I would have liked a SBD. 

VERDICT:

This is probably the best set in the Clone Wars series, as it's fairly priced and extremely well built!

"wyoeaglefan","2008-10-14T11:53:22.64Z","Droid whatship?","This set is another mind boggler, especially for the price. The finished ship is tiny, and resembles it's Battlefront counterpart, but not well. The so called &quot;pilot droid&quot; is a joke. Just a normal droid but without the arms for the blasters. There's no cargo hold, and the disc feels too thin. And $30 is waaay to much for this set. Definately should have been a max of $20. That way you could have bought more of them for when the republic gunship owned like 6 of these at a time!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-29T18:09:01.543Z","Not Bad","This is a nice set but with some weaknesses. First, there should be a rotating gun on the gunship because it was seen in Episode 3. Also, the pilot droid should be blue. Besides those weaknesses, this isn't bad.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"arctrooper170","2008-08-18T22:40:01.903Z","The droids strike back!","The droid gunship is one of the best priced sets and its pretty fair because for 329 pieces and 30 bucks I mean the naboo fighter has only 289 pieces for 30 bucks so if you think this is to much then your a baby. Now the pros and cons:

PROS:
1. Fair price
2. not many stickers
3. durable and sturdy
4. detail is good
5. pretty big
6. 3 droids
7. bombs work well

CONS: 
1. droid doesnt sit well

but overall this is a great and if you ever find it at wal-mart then you should buy it 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"THX_1138","2008-08-31T09:11:55.75Z","Awesome and accurate","This is a sweet and cheap set. It is also a pretty accurate one.
Pros:
-Cheap.
-Three droids.
-Awesome bomb dropping mechanism.
-Only six stickers (not  pro for me, as I never really minded stickers much, but this could be a pro for others).

Cons:
-Why does it have a cockpit? This isn't a piloted vehicle. It has a droid brain.
-No clones.
Overall, get this set if you can. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2009-07-14T12:19:58.577Z","good smaller colne wars set","a much better value than the spider droid is the droid gun ship. its probabily twich as big and the design is actually very good.

building it is actually a challange. the mechanics on the bottom can seem confusing while building and you ask ""will this work?"" a lot of geers, technic rods and rotatable pieces. the head is fairly simple, with just basic bricks and other pieces like that.

the missles work better as bombs though because the just fall off. they can be irratating to put back on and tend to fall off whenever. luckely, ther are locks for both sets of bombs and are easy to use. 

the figures are all regular tan battle droids. i dont know what the colors mean but i heard blue is for a pilot. it doesnt matter because you cant see him.

the onle flaw is its hard to put down. there isnt a very good stant and it isnt flat on the bottom however the bombs stay on and if its on a bed or couch it doesnt matter because its not as bad as it sounds.

8/10 for complicated building, only 4 stickers and the function works well!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ian","2009-01-10T16:09:03.343Z","WOW...","This set is amazing! what more could you want i'ts a clone wars set with reasonable price, a decent size,good playability,AND A TON OF FUN!

THE BUILD was pretty good it was fun and quick just how I like it.


THE PLAYING WITH is awesome! It's got so many blasters on it I lost count of how many it has.It's very sturdy it doesn't break easily. And you can put battle droids on top of it so it acts like a transport a fighter and a bomber!



OVERALL An amazing set buy it if you can you'll be sorry if you don't.

"shinjix2","2009-03-18T10:19:11.92Z","A Decent Set","This is one of those unique Star Wars sets that you should consider getting. It stands apart from your usual space crafts, speeders, and walkers. Another neat aspect of this ship is the bomb system. 

Pros:
Bomb System
Gun Manueverability
Unique Design

Cons:
Applying your own stickers",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"yoey11","2009-02-10T14:03:02.187Z","GREAT!","This set is easy to build. I think it was a little expensive.

                                        bombs are awkward to fit back on

"rexrules","2008-12-30T01:19:25.577Z","fear the sepratist","this is an awsome set with enough fire power to destroy the at-te and all the clones guarding it.

pros: big about the size of the one on the box
da bombs wich are actualy missiles.
only six stickers
good price for a thing this size (the republic attack gunship is smaller then the star destroyer but more expensive)
very acurate to the real one

cons: bombs fall out to easily

other than that it is a great set I recomend it to sepritist lovers like me",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"captain_radda_radda","2009-10-04T21:41:21.45Z","Worth every penny","This has to be one of the best priced lego sets out there. I mean, this set is BIG. What I like best is its Video Game/movie accuracy. I recently played Battlefront II and noticed how extremely accurate this set is. From the missiles to the quad-lasers, this set has it. I really like the design for the ""eyes"". In my opinion, this is defiately the biggest and best droid aircraft out there. 

Pros
Nice and big without the pain of an empty wallet
Extremly movie accuare details. Watch episode III and you'll see what I mean
Bomb dropping function works great
Overly armed! This has enough firepower to take down the Attack Shuttle
Enough standing room on top for a small squad of troops
The stickers that are used make the set look better
The cockpit doesnt flop around

Cons:
I didnt get 2 :,(

Overall:
An outstanding droid set that adds a flare to any army. Lego should pull a republic fighter tank and re-release it. If you can find it: buy it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jjr","2009-01-12T12:18:18.153Z","gunship attack!!","the first time I heard this set would be released in 2008 I was amazed. and after I saw a few picturers i really wanted to have one, so I did.

the built is simple, mostly flat. until you start with the head wich is interesting to built. the ball turrets are very nice and finished it looks like the real thing.

to play with it is also good, it can drop bombs on your clone forces, but it takes for me too long find al the bombs and place them on the right place, but they also looking cool. 

value to the money, this is the part I always hate. in most stores here in the netherlands it's 40 euro (on shop at home 35) wich is really expensive. but If you have the  money (like me) buy it.

and even after a while I got one from my dad, so I have two of these powerfull gunships.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

	This set was bought for me one&nbsp;Christmas&nbsp;and i enjoyed building it and liked the figures</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		Good unique&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;for other&nbsp;constructions&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Great space for placing the pilot and taking him out for quick play</li>
	<li>
		More than needed figures for the one piloted ship</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The front main cannon and side cannons on the ship fall off easily</li>
	<li>
		No pilot droid included for the main pilot spot</li>
	<li>
		The main bomb feature falls off very easily</li>
</ul>
<p>
	As a conclusion i would have to say for the price of &pound;24.49, $29.99 i think it is a decent price for the PPP (price per piece) is pretty good and the&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;are used allot so dont count much, but its a good piece to add to any collection.</p>
