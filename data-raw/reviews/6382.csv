Pros
-New minis
-tons of functions 
-looks like the real thing on battlefront
-It goes well also with episode 3 clones and with stormies (an other version of this tank is used also by the empire)
-nice cockpit with computers

Cons
-about 8 stickers (for who don't like them)
-high legoshop price (70 euros)
-the main body is a little bit blocky
-should come with another clone

Finally,I think you should buy this set,It worth the moneys.I think also that for the number of pieces it's better than the v-19 torrent at similar price.

"ngclarkiv","2008-10-09T10:42:43.53Z","Republic Fighter Tank: IN AMERICA","I'm from America and I just got this set yesterday at my local target.  Its an amazing set.  

The Republic Fighter Tank's body is the first part to build.  The Tank's body contains all of the following: Two seats for both clones, one inside for a clone to man the controls and a spring mechanism for the other seat so that the other clone can be inside or outside the tank manning the turret.  It also has a windshield part that I didn't know about so that the clone manning the controls can look out, you can open up the front to view the engine, a turret on topic, and wheels for the tank to move easily.

The Republic Fighter Tank's sides include three flick fire missiles on both sides and a compartment to place weapons or visors, antennaes, helmet lights, and pauldrons.  It has a great amount of room.

PROS:
Two Clones
6 Missiles
Wheels to make it move alot easier
Spring mechanism works amazing
A great item for your clone army

CONS:
9 Stickers (not a fan)

Other than the stickers this set is great for everyone whether your a Star Wars collector or just like playing with them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros: 
-comes with two clone trooper minifigs 
-has wheels for turning 
-has two cool compartments for storeing the blasters 
-includes SIX flick fire missles 
-turret mechanism is sweet! 
-main guns and turret gun both adjust
-cool roomy cockpit 

Cons: 
-none! 

This set is probably recognized as the best clone wars set yet. Its design fits the clone wars scheme perfectly, its price is perfect with 592 pieces for only $50. This set is truly wonderful! If you haven't been impressed with the clone wars sets so far, you will be impressed with this one!

"Paradoxymoron","2008-10-18T17:42:42.733Z","Awesomely awesome","I got this set earlier today and it rocks! It took me about an hour to build but the wait was worth it! The tank rests on four thin wheels which allow it to glide along on most surfaces and has a variety of moving parts. The two side guns move up and down, the top gun spins 360 degrees and moves up and down, the side armor at the back flips up to show flick-fire missles, compartments open to store the minifigs'guns, the front opens to reveal an engine, and when you open a hatch at the back the hatch on top flies open and a clone pops up to man the top gun!

Pros:
2 new clones
2 short blasters(I hate the long ones)

"wyoeaglefan","2008-12-29T13:29:23.187Z","I love this tank!","Very accurate model from the Lego team. This set seems to be even scaled pretty closely with the actual TX-130s from Battlefront and The Clone Wars videogames. The tank looks great, is sturdy and fun to build. I only have two complaints. A few more clones, or maybe a droid or two would have been nice. (I know Lego is only skimping on clones to get people to buy the Clone Walker Battle pack) And the dreaded stickers return. I think the looks of the tank would've been complemented wisely with printed pieces rather than stickers, even if they had only printed the 12X3 wedges. Otherwise great addition to the collection and/or army! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"water_jedi_17","2008-11-11T18:17:58.56Z","Lego’s Greatest Clone Wars Set","This is one of Lego’s greatest sets made so far so let’s begin the review:
The box is standard clone wars format and shows you how a trooper looks like with and without the equipment(more on that later). The back shows the features which I will talk about. It also advertises 7673,7674, and 7675.
The instructions are pretty straightforward although there is only one manual. Other sets such as the Jetrax T6 and Deep Sea Quest have 2(or 3 in the case of the Jetrax) and both have less pieces. A final note is on the 3rd page, you can see a Vader helmet (like the one on early 08sets)but the other pages don’t have that. 
This set is quite huge and you will be surprised how big it is compared to a minifig. A minifig barely rises above the ‘wings’ of the tank. The wings have a compartment to store blasters but unfortunately, that’s almost all you can place in there plus the floodlights. Another disappointment is the small cockpit which can barely fit a clone. I expected a place where I could stash leftover parts but oh well. The top seat is quite impressive, though. When you lower the seat and close the back exit, you can keep the clone sealed inside. By simply opening the door again, he can come out an man the cannon again. Another pro the designers placed in the set is the easy to remove top. You can easily insert a clone inside instead of ripping off all the pieces to put a minifig inside. The front part of the tank can reveal a small engine although it isn’t as detailed as I expected. A final feature are the hidden flick fire missiles which do not interfere with any other sections of the set. Finally there are four wheels for realistic play and to show a hover effect. There are 2 floodlights,2 comlinks,2 DC-15 blasters,1 kama,1 visor,2 blasters, and 1 pauldron. Overall, this is an excellent set and I recommend it to any clone wars fan. Now the pros and cons:
    
Pros:  
2 clones
realistic details
HUGE set
hours of play
hidden compartments
advanced build
top seat can go up and down
good piece to price ratio
Cons:
stickers(well for me)
cramped cockpit

The design of the tank does not disappoint.  The color scheme is right on with the Gunship.  I like the flip-around missile launchers on the side-fins.  It is also nice to see the front open to reveal an engine.  Having the little wheels underneath to allow the ship to glide is a great and easy design element that really increases the playability.

I am a little disappointed in the to turret.  I would like to have seen something more substantial, or at least closer to the clone that rises up.

I was worried I wouldn't be able to get this as it wasn't in any Targets I went to and it was not available for reasonable prices online, but I got it for Christmas!
Pros:
-Quite accurate.
-592 pieces for only $49.99. Pretty good for a SW set.
-The flip-out weapons work well. 
-It actually has an interior with controls.
-The features like the hatch on top, the hatch on the back and the engine are cool.
-The new clones are cool, as are the accessories.
Cons:
-Stickers (I don't mind but some fans might).
-6 flick-fire missiles.
-To make the flick-fire missiles worse, they have transparent cones on the ends.
-Only two figs for $49.99. Then again, most SW sets this year are at least that bad. Could've been worse though *cough*V-19*cough*

It has the added bonus of not having to place any stickers on at all. It is pretty large in size and takes up some room. The only thing that I wish it had was one or two more clone minifigs with it.

The wings:

Well, I didn't know what else to call them. There's a place to hold a gun, but that sometimes jams when you close it. The fold up missile launcer is awesome, as it can fold down if your being bombed by Hyena Droids. The missiles fire well, and unlike most people, I personally love flick-fire, but that's probably just me. The detailing on this is outstanding, you can tell that Lego went out of there way to make every brick count.

Main structure:

This is the part with all the details. On the bottom, there are four hidden wheels that roll really well, giving it the ""hovering"" effect. The huge curved part opens up to reveal the engine, which adds even more to this sets incredible detailing. On the back there is a door for the cockpit, and if you open it, the gunner pops out the top. The guns are amazing, and they look like they could blast a droid formation into shreds. The driver also has a windshield, and that's just cool.

Inside:

There are actually two seats, not one. The drivers seat is on the bottom, and he has a computer to target locations with. The gunner sits above him, and he can pop up through the roof and get a clear view of the battlefield anytime.

Top:

This part lifts off so that you can play inside. The gunner can also pop through the top and man the turret, (which I don't like because it's loose) and then drop back down and close the hatch if there under heavy fire. The antenna on top ALWAYS break and fall off, so there a pain in the back.

Pros:

Two figs
Grey Kama armor
Big for 50$
Really detailed

Cons:
Could have added some droids
Troopers can't sit down with Kama armor on
Antenna breaks off

I hate stickers coz when you could not put them perfectly, they look awful. They get cruked and in time due to heat and moisture they peal off. Then again this tank is awesome, this tank is build strong and hard. As I have read on the review, the wheels gives this tank an illusion of hovering which it really does. When you push it with a little twist, the tank drifts coz of the plastic wheels. You have to have this to experience it I tell you. Color scheme is fantastic, pop up gunner seat is genious.

Pro's
- Sturdy and compact built tank
- Hovering effect

<p>Play experience 5/5: This set is very good to play with. It goes along very well with the aat and pirate tank. The gun turrent is a very nice feature. The secret missile conpartment is a very good idea.</p>
<p>Parts 5/5: There are some very nice parts in this set like the ARC trooper gear. The stickers look surprisingly good.</p>
<p>Overall 5/5: This is a very nice set and any clone wars fan should get it.</p>

"PaulTR","2011-06-14T13:46:09.877Z","Droid Bowling Has Never Been so Fun!","<p>When I first saw the 7679 Republic Fighter Tank, I was very interested in it. As&nbsp;only the 3rd Expanded Universe set released, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;buy the set.&nbsp;Boy, am I glad I did! Without a doubt, the 7679 is one of the best Star Wars sets ever released!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fighter Tank looks absolutely amazing, with its numerous weapons, beastly looks,&nbsp;and accurate color.&nbsp;From a&nbsp;technical view, the set is&nbsp;very faithful to SW canon: the guns are accurately placed,&nbsp;and the set is&nbsp;to scale with minifigures. The color scheme is&nbsp;fantastic looking, with just the right amount of Republic Red, white, and lime green&nbsp;coloring to&nbsp;give the tank a realistic look. The ""floating"" design is also&nbsp;realistic; indeed, you can barely tell the&nbsp;set is supported by wheels. Even the flick-fire missiles, which I&nbsp;would normally&nbsp;shun, look great; the fact that they&nbsp;are SW canon is also another&nbsp;plus.&nbsp;The set is also an absolute monster in size; indeed, it is one of the bigger SW sets released.&nbsp;The only thing that might&nbsp;annoy people about the set's appearence is the use of stickers on the side wings and a&nbsp;single one on the engine block.&nbsp;But besides&nbsp;that, this set&nbsp;looks stunning; indeed, I would go as far as to say this may be one of the most realistic-looking SW sets to date, excluding the&nbsp;UCS (Ultimate Collector Series) sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 7679 was a fun and interesting build. The main cabin is attached to wheels to give the set movement; the side&nbsp;wings, equipped&nbsp;with clever&nbsp;storage spaces and&nbsp;concealed weapons, are then attached to the body of the set.&nbsp;All in all, it's a&nbsp;great, sturdy&nbsp;design; the only un-sturdy part is&nbsp;the top hatch and the twin&nbsp;antenna, which&nbsp;can fall off&nbsp;if you play with the set too roughly. Also, while I&nbsp;like the pop-up gunner seat, I feel it takes up a bit too much space. But that's just a little grip of mine, and even if it is a legit complaint, the pop-up seat is a breeze to remove.&nbsp;As far as parts go,&nbsp;this set has got you covered! Republic Red pieces, sloped white parts, sloped bricks, and some useful, slanted vents in lime green and red are the&nbsp;best pieces, and you get plenty of them. A pair of clone minifigures and&nbsp;nifty ARC armor/visor/rangefinder/spot lamp are also useful additions to the set. However, there's not really any new&nbsp;pieces, so that is a slight disappointment. But this&nbsp;can be forgiven when you consider the price-per-piece&nbsp;ratio: 592 pieces at $50 US dollars (MSRP), which, considering TLG's recent price hike, is a fabulous deal. In fact, if TLG's&nbsp;current pricing&nbsp;was to be used on this set, it would&nbsp;probably&nbsp;be sold for around $65! So,&nbsp;score one for all you&nbsp;penny-pinchers out there!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is a joy to play with. You can roll the tank on just about any surface, rotate the lasers, pop the gunner up, open the set up, store gear in the lockers, and fire the flick-fires. You can have tons of fun rolling the tank into battle against CIS forces, mowing down droids with flick-fires, the twin cannons, and mini lasers.&nbsp;It's also fun to slide the tank into a line of battle droid figs and watch them scatter (""Strike!""-Clone driver). Honestly, my only complain is that I wish&nbsp;the set&nbsp;contained another clone; while I totally agree with the price, I think another clone would have&nbsp;made this set a tad bit marketable.&nbsp;But&nbsp;overall, this set is simply loaded with play features, and should keep you entertained for quite some time. Alrighty! Let me stack up&nbsp;the facts for you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Incredibly accurate looking</p>

<li>-Pop-seat mechanism&nbsp;a bit big

<li>-Another clone would have been cool 
<li></li></ul>
<p>So, is the 7679 Republic Fighter Tank&nbsp;worthy of the "" LEGO Star Wars"" moniker? YES! Without a single doubt, this is one of the best SW sets (might&nbsp;I even postulate, best LEGO set? :) ever released.&nbsp;Whether you like&nbsp;to play with&nbsp;your sets or simply display them,&nbsp;this set is perfect for you!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
