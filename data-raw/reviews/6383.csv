I am trying to buy a new one for Playstation 2.  Over all, this is an awesome set and I hope to get it again!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T15:00:03.2Z","A Great game to play!","This set has all the great levels from episodes 1, 2, and 3 and if you gather all the jedi meters each level, you get the first chapter of episode 4. This is very easy to complete and it comes with very cool characters that you cannot get in lego stores. I do have some of the minifigures that you can't get at LEGO stores but I am still getting others. This game includes classic lego mini-kits which each contain pieces that go toward you mini-model for that level. You are also shown some great ships as well, like the starfighters, republic gunship, and many more. I suggest that you don't use any cheats in this game because that does not make it any fun for you. The hardest and or longest levels in the game that I say are the Mos Espa Podrace and Battle on Kashyyyk. My favorite level is the Beginning of the Revenge of the Sith game with anakin and obi-wan's jedi starfighters. To make that level easy, save up your coins and buy invincibility in dexter's diner. The same goes for Mos Espa Podrace. So if your bored, than go grab one of these Lego Star Wars games!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
