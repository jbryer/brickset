<p>The 2907 STW ST Clone Trooper kids watch.</p>

<p>This set has 30 pieces and unlike the set listed on brickset (W007-1) does include a&nbsp;clone trooper minifig, as pictured but not described.</p>

<p>In general not really different from the many other Lego kids watches. Probably over-priced for a basic kids watch, but a nice little set and great gift for younger children.</p>

<p>Basic info :</p>

<p>Minifigs : 1 Clone Trooper.&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/sw128a/Clone-Trooper-Ep-3-Yellow-Markings-No-Pauldron-Star-Corps-Trooper"">http://brickset.com/minifigs/sw128a/Clone-Trooper-Ep-3-Yellow-Markings-No-Pauldron-Star-Corps-Trooper</a></p>

<p>Set Number On Box : 2907 STW ST.</p>

<p>Pieces : 30.</p>
