<p>The claimed range of 30' is accuate.&nbsp; What isn't mentioned is that it works indirectly, too.&nbsp; Corners or kids are no match for it.</p>

<p>One complaint for LEGO (not specifically against this kit) is that Power Functions kits should be available.&nbsp; Rather than piecing together various PF components for a train - sell a kit!&nbsp; Same is true for motorizing models - sell a kit including motors, receivers, transmitters and battery packs.&nbsp; Another solution is to offer these components on a LDD setup that error-checks to make sure you have all necessary components.&nbsp; PF adds so much to LEGO sets, so I can't believe that LEGO would let this slide.</p>
