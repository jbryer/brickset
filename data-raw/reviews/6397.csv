This is the technology that causes us to push the TV remote buttons harder and harder and harder, because it just isn't working, (why do we do that?)

My concerns were unjust.  It seems almost impossible to cause the signal to be interrupted, without actually leaving the room.  Even when covering the transmitter with my hand the light must have been bouncing up my shirtsleeve or something, because the signal was still received.

This is still IR however, and it's inevitable that there will be occasions when the signal is interrupted, and this is bound to be at the least practical moment too.

The unit takes 3 AAA batteries.  Given the strength of the signal I was concerned that there may be excessive battery drain, however I am still on my first set.

There are four channels available, so there is some scope for multiple users in the same room, or more complex models using multiple controllers.

One complaint - this product is likely to be used for RC cars, yet the unit has two, immovable joysticks which both point north south.  This makes it difficult when steering a car, for example, where left-right / east-west access would be more natural.  Four way movement would fix this, even if it only responded to a two way output.

All the above could be rectified by creating an RC unit built from two controllers, but then of course you'd have to buy another controller...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
