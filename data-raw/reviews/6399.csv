"Nattyd31","2007-12-27T17:45:18.467Z","Best so far!","this is seriously the best phantoka yet. Its weopons, while reused from other sets(which is okay, unless were talking about mutran and vican)are well placed.It looks a little awkward standing up straight but when its knees are bent it is fine. One thing is that I really wish the mask of shadows was a differnt color. 1, for a collecting pupose, and 2, for a better look.

             pros:
                  - Great pieces
                  - Legos favorite color- maroon!
                  - Sick weopans
                  - perfect for moCs
             Cons:
                  -Same old mask of shadows
                  -Awkward standing 

                 You all should take advantage of this and buy it!!

"Gus_263","2008-06-12T17:43:20.28Z","This is the best phantoka...","This set was released at the first season of this year, and is a special edition. Released in a approximated time to the phantoka, this can be considered one. This is the best of them and is the phantoka that includes more pieces, and different features. Features like the mask of shadows from the first makuta (teridax) of 2003, and others that I will review. 

This don't have some differences in the building of the set, like the all-new body from the makuta phantoka (that isn't very good for technic, basically for bionicle, altough can be compatible easily with technic), with the system to launch tridax pod containig some shadow leeches (again those special pieces, these likes the squids from 2007). Four black/silver coloured wings are included to this, and on the back of the set, have a system to flap them keeping a place for any of the all-new matoran from 2008 with another special piece. The building started with inika is in this set on the arms, except in one arm with the shield, where are placed a hordika's arm. The shield rotates well and includes two antroz's blades, and a gahlok-kal's shield. 

The building of the legs are like the building from gadunka, with rahkshis' legs and armors above a technic piece with connections to pieces linked to the leg by a ball joint. The set moves the legs well, but aren't tall as in some other sets. The building next to the body includes too hordika heads to connects with an armor. The building of the feet is one of the few innovations, a bohroks' tooth is on the front, and on back, a blade (know in some sets as electro blades). The head keeps with a short piece of eyes and changed in position to keeps the mask. The colors are awesome, the crimsom, the black and silver makes a great scheme for the set.

This set is recommended for who likes bionicle or the first makuta. But includes too something useful for technic, don't arms or legs, but essential pieces. The features are basically the shield, wings, tridax pod, and the mask. The other tools are easy to make, like the ehlek's claws or the hewkii's blades. This set is the best phantoka because have more pieces, have pratically the same  building of gadunka's legs (but this is better than a building of toa in a board) and have the features that I described. If anyone says that this set isn't creative, is easy pick the pieces and makes another building. But still due to same special pieces, and in overall, a 4,7 set of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Lots of blades so you can build more cool models

"Alemas","2009-05-19T16:21:02.467Z","The Big Guy!","This is my biggest Bionicle character, and it's HUGE! The ""piston-legs"" work to support the main legs! In fact, I enjoyed hours moving the legs, and feeling how the pistons go up and down! The rotating shield is awesome, using Technic pieces to rotate it!

Pros:

Big legs
Spinning shield
Awesome sword
Double-faced mask

Cons:

Rotating shield could have used wrist articulation
Claws get in the way of the sword

Overall, a great set!

Legs are pretty good, but arms are really lame, especially his right hand. I expected more from set that is so overpriced and so rare.<br />

This is not hate, I like him overall, but it&#39;s not the greatest set I had for such money.</p>
