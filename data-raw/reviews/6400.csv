"newlegoset333","2008-08-02T18:22:37.06Z","A great set if you want the vehicles!","On Thursday, Mazeka showed up at my Lego store (He is now on Shop@home,) so I got him. He has a Swamp Strider, which is very cool, because it features new ways to use titan legs, and has many poses to use. The Strider can pint up, down, and swing in 360. The Legs are hard to pose, but they still move. The best place to have the Swamp Strider is on the carpet, where it'll stay balanced. The blaster is fun to fire too. Now, Mazeka himself is just a regular Matoran, with very few new pieces, but he can fit into the vehicle easily, and you can take him out easily too. Another great thing about the set, is that you can put any 2008 Matoran in it!I'd say this set has 0 flaws, except for the legs. Other than that, I'd give this set 5 stars!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Aleiobot","2008-11-01T21:36:49.967Z","The awesomest matoran set!","I got this set today for my birthday. I didn't buy this set,however it was well worth the money. Compared to any other matoran set, this is definintly the best one yet! It includes Mazeka, the Helryx Swamp Strider Vehicle, and 9 light spheres!Here is the pros and cons:

Pros:
Rapid fire blaster
Cool matoran and vehicle.
Vehicle rotates in all  directions and legs move
Vehicle has area for figure to sit.

Cons: sort of hard to put figure's hands on handles.
legs sort of unstable.

Including the cons, this is still an overall extremely awesome and excusive set! Any bionicle collector should put this at the top of their wishlist! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"18000pieces","2009-02-16T08:17:13.937Z","Cool vehicle!","I got this set for only thrteen bucks at Wal-Mart (They're really trying to clear the shelves from the '08 sets). that is the best piece/price ratio I've ever gotten on a bionicle.

Mazeka- Just and av-matoran. Still, he is my first one, as I wasn't willing to shell out for one on its own. Tallest matoran yet, might be worth buying some standalones if they lowered the price a couple of bucks.

Swamp Strider - Cool, took me about an hour to build. Made my thumbs sore, but it was worth it in the end. THe thing just looks so cool! The turret has a huge work envelope (robotics term, look it up) and the firing mechanism for the zamor launcher is extended all the way back out the back of the vehicle. the seat works well, as does the tilting mechanism. the legs are a little awkward, better for posing than for walking. overall, worth it for the sale price, or even just for the regular price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"raoulxb","2009-07-18T05:37:34.763Z","Brilliant walker","This was the last set i bought from woolworths(before it closed down) so it has some sentimental value. It was a woolworths exclucive.
The massive walker is awesome and easy to build.

Pros:
Loads of zomor spheres
sturdy legs
mazeka matoran is easy to attach/dettach
great detail
cheap
rotates

cons
The walker can look up but not down

otherwise a must have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-22T11:06:04.717Z","Amazing!","This set is very cool. It will give you hours of fun if yo also have Vultraz.  On to the review.

    Mazeka-The Ko-Matoran is a lot like Solek. The only differences are his hands are white instead of gray, and his mask, the Volitak is one of my personal favorite masks. He attaches to the strider very easily.

    Swamp strider-The main part of the set. It has two main sections: The bottom section with the legs and the upper section with the turntable and the zamor launcher. (In this case midak skyblaster.) The legs have those Carapar claws which look so detailed. It's fun to build and has a very complex design. It can also aim almost in any direction.

Pros:
Cool mask.
Awesome design.
Great source of rare pieces.
Can aim in many different places.
Includes nine light spheres.

Cons:
None

In all, an awesome set for your collection. I recommend this to any Bionicle fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"JD1992","2010-01-26T17:11:45.733Z","Sweet.","I got Mazeka a little over a year ago, and I must say, he is amazing. Not even an hour to build his turret, never mind himself, which took about, oh I'd say, not even a minute.

As a Bionicle fan since it first came out, I've been fascinated with it. Fell in love with my Onua when I was 9. Good times. I noticed it started taking a downfall, so I decided to pick up Mazeka and have a look-see at him.

Mazeka is full of re-colored and already used parts, which made me upset, speaking that I am always excited for some new parts. The functions in this surprised me with awe, speaking that it's a walking turret. The zamors coming down and the giant push-pin thing was awesome. I really like what Lego did with this.

Pros:
-fun to play with
-A WALKING TURRET.
-Zamor feature is fascinating

Cons:
-not much of new pieces
-can't shoot downwards unless your Toa/Makuta/whatever villain or hero was at least a foot away",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"J6Crash","2012-04-30T22:41:37.06Z","High expectations disappointed","<p>Here's the issue:&nbsp; I bought this set full price without actually looking at it carefully, which is why I ended up disappointed with the final product.&nbsp; I saw a walking turret and I was immediately in love with the idea, so I went on an impulse.&nbsp; That should explain the relatively low overall score.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are really nothing special; no recolors, no new parts.&nbsp; There are some always useful pieces such as the tri-axle and Technic bits, and some parts not available in many sets such as the mask, Carapar claws, and gunmetal armor, but that's it.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build was actually pretty good, as it should be as a larger set.&nbsp; The legs are a bit repetitive and uninteresting, but the turret construction is decent fun, even if the mechanisms are fairly simple.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The finished set is where I was most disappointed.&nbsp; It looks pretty sweet, if a little gappy and rough just standing there, but the legs really could use a do-over.&nbsp; They have virtually no aesthetic touches and, more importantly when playing with it, allow for very little movement.&nbsp; Up and down, that's it. I had been imagining all of the cool poses I would put it into but in reality, all it could really do was stand there.&nbsp; The turret movement was nice but the legs killed it for me.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A decent set, but my disappointment colors my personal opinion of it for the worse.&nbsp; The legs are pretty bad, so I wouldn't have bought it for full price had I done my research.<br></p>",TRUE,2,3,4,4,3

<p>It&#39;s a great building experence, has somewhat too many recycled pieces/non recoloured pieces, great function and isn&#39;t a durable set.</p>

"Nmfrey23","2022-04-12T20:56:19.48Z","Turret? Moving vehicle? Why not both?","<p>This set is awesome in concept alone. It&#39;s a turret that can rotate 360 degrees that walks on four legs. The set itself is just as good as the concept. The turret fires perfectly and has a surprising range of motion. Mazeka should be proud to pilot this vehicle.</p>

<p>Mazeka:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>He&#39;s a perfect fit for the turret&#39;s seat.</p>

<p>While not a new part, I do like the mask choice.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Can&#39;t move very well (Av Matoran limbs).</p>

<p>Blue pins are an eyesore whenever Mazeka is detached from the turret.</p>

<p>Brittle joints (applies to all 08&#39;-10&#39; sets).</p>

<p>The turret (Swamp Strider):</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Turret fires exceptionally well. The top of the set is essentially one giant launcher with a driver&#39;s seat (holds 9 shots &amp; is compatible with 2006 ammo).</p>

<p>The turret can swivel 360 degrees and tilt up and down.</p>

<p>Complexity: The build is fun and fairly complex.</p>

<p>Legs move in two different places.</p>

<p>Plenty of blade and armour pieces.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>The red axles in the legs stand out a bit.</p>

<p>The launcher can pull itself apart if it gets dusty.</p>

<p>The top two ammo chambers don&#39;t always feed into the central one.</p>

<p>Brittle joints (applies to all 08&#39;-10&#39; sets).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a favourite of mine from 2008. It&#39;s such an unusual build, but it works so well as a set. Despite being a limited release set, Mazeka is still fairly cheap. If you can find a reasonably priced copy, check this set out. 5/5.</p>
