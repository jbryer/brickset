"exo_force_fan200","2008-12-26T15:58:54.857Z","Way bigger than the photo!","As the title says, do not look to the photo for size : P.  The vehicle is actually about 1 foot long.  That's if you don't count the engine.  The engine is made up of one of the new engine pieces and 2 jetpacks.  Besides the engine, the vehicle also has 4 wings for flying.  2 more wings with lasers attached to them fold down if you turn the knob on the back to the left.  Turn it to the right to raise them back up.  The vehicle has what is supposed to be a Midak Skyblaster inside the green compartment, however it is actually a Zamor sphere launcher : (.  With 2 spears on the front, 2 thorns on the bottom for landing gear, 2 katani, on the sides, and 2 different types of Bohrok-kal shields on the sides for armor this vehicle is chock full of cool pieces : ).  The Midak Skyblaster which is actually a Zamor sphere launcher can hold 6 light spheres.  The figure whose name is Pohatu Nuva has a mask with a targeting display.  He is one of few Bionicle sets that has back armor : ).  However, this means he has no chest armor : (.  Overall, this set gets a 4.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Lets go straight to the pros and cons of the Rockoh T3;

Pros:
Sleek.
Not too heavy.
Challenging build.
Nice functions.
Lots of old pieces.
Sweet side panels.
Sturdy, great for ramming other, smaller, ships like Vultraz's Skyfighter.
Pohatu has nice armour on his back, great for MOCing.

Cons:
Takes a while to sit Pohatu.
Not a lot of green, but that's not too bad.
Ammo can get lost inside the ship if dropped and might jam the functions.


Overall a great set, highly recommended.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pohatu Nuva
Pros.
awesome figure
good armor
armor is reversed so that he is back is protected

Cons.
mask is exactly the same, except with fins, but it's still cool
hard to seat Pohatu at first-there is an axel to put his feet against and you have to move the feet so they don't get in the way of the firing lever

Rockoh T3
Pros.
challenging build
well-built
lots of weapons and armor that can be used on a figure
firing clip has six zamors and a piece to keep them from falling out

Cons.
Only the wings with the lazers on them can fold in
only two green plates that aren't figure equipment as armor

Overall I don't think these are much of a problem, so buy this set if you have the money",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kibble123456789","2009-08-15T18:22:46.047Z","no complaints (exept one:P)","I have to admit for my first new vehicle it's awesome!  This set is historic in my bionicle life because it started me back into the series I dropped out at inika but no I'm back, so anyway about the set. 

General
 It is the hardest set to build under $80 but the finished product is worth it!  


Pohatu
Pohatu is awesome because his mask resembles the mask of time, he is equipped with a water mask but is a phantoka, and it's up to you which weapons he has.  but on the other foot he well has no cons about him:P(exept one small one).

pros

customizable weaponry 
mask is awesome and resembles the mask of time 
sturdy
can go underwater which is cool because is is a rock eliminated Toa
color scheme 

cons (very minor)

his orange coloring is a little different 

overall 5/5

pros

handlebars 
wings
bohrok weapons
fold down wings
good seat
zamor spheres 
color scheme 

cons

doesn't stand up

overall 4/5
