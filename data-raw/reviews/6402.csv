"tahu2008","2008-10-09T20:16:14.653Z","Antroz doesn't deserve something this cool!","I got this set for my birthday in august, and when I ripped of the wrapping paper all I could do was stare!  For starters,the box was ENORMOUS!  The other reason was I thought it was going to be an aqua raiders set.  When I opened it, I was struck at how many pieces it had.  When I started building it, it became clear the the nose and the body would be a bit tricky. After restarting three times I figured out what I had been doing wrong and it was smooth sailing from there.  After I finished, I took a good look at it and thought &quot;the box didn't lie, this thing is ENORMOUS!&quot;  It is not bulky and chunky like some of the other battle cruisers, but rather stream lined and realistic.  This thing is a treasure trove of good pieces, and the engines give it a realistic touch.  Some how I don't think a half dome could some thing as heavy as a Rohkoh in the air.  I really like ho the wings fold up just a the press of the button.  I don't think to much of the antroz figure though. Ether his legs are too big for his body of his body is too small for the rest of him.  It doesn't really matter though, because you can't see all that once he is in the ship. The midak sky blasters make is really fun to play with.  I like how the cock pit opens and closes, instead of having no cockpit and just sitting on a little depression like the other vehicles.  Now for the pros and cons

Pros
stream lined body
engines
fold up wings
lots of cool pieces
cockpit
three midak sky blasters

Cons
Little bit tricky to build (but I like a little challenge)
antroz figure is a little weird (But you bought this for the Jetrax not him)

Anyhow this makes a great addition to your Makuta army.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
