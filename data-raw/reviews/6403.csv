You can, in fact, keep the tri-arms open when you put the Axalara T9 on it's landing gear.  Just thought you buyers out there might wanna know!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"The_Chronicler","2009-10-11T04:26:40.67Z","Big Red Rocket","I have recently bought this set, the Axalara T9, from the entertainer toy shop in Wimbledon at a heavily reduced price, 40% off, from £50 to £30. I would certainly not have bought it otherwise, but it was a good purchase, and lego is so rarely reduced...
ON TO THE REVIEW!

Lewa Nuva:
Lewa Nuva is okay, but I think his mask looks much grumpier than any of the other Lewas. He has the same stupid proportions as almost every Bionicle these days, because arms are as long as his legs, meaning that his hands go beneath his knees. Do your hands go beneath your knees? No, I didn't think so. Nice fins on the helmet though.

Pros:
Fins are good.
Alright colour scheme, works well against the red of the Axalara.

Cons:
Really, really grumpy face.
Idiotic proportions.

The Axalara T9:
The Axalara is the largest of the three vehicle sets. You see that picture up there? You see how big and red it looks? Well, it's not really that big or that red. After building it, you think, wow, this is certainly a large set. But then you compare it to something like the imperial star destroyer (yes, the £250 one) and you realise that it is big, for a Bionicle set, but that doesn't really mean much when most of them are about the height of a very small cat.

And it's not the red on the box. It's a much duller red. Still, I am not one to trust boxes, so I suspected that would be the case the whole time.
Speaking of boxes, the box is rather large, and rather heavy, and if it fell on a hamster, it would crush it flat. It's around the size of a very large TV screen.

However, the handle on the bottom certainly makes it swooshable, and I am all for more gears and mechanisms in the world of Bionicle. The mechanisms are good: I love twisting a gear to make the tri-arms flip out and flip in again. Flip out, flip in, flip out, flip in... The mechanism to make the midaks pop out of the sides is good as well, although I wish there was a way to get them to fire from further back, as in the Rockoh T3. 

Pros:
Excellent mechanisms. Really need to see more of these in Bionicle. Are you listening, Lego?
Nice and bulky. It feels sturdy in your hand, like it could actually fly.
Love the front end, with the red bitil wings, and the turbines

Cons:
Price (but not for me! AHAHAHAHAHAAAA!)
The box! It lies!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-11-02T16:05:59.577Z","""I would have ever-remembered you.""-Lewa Nuva","This set is AMAZING! It is the second biggest Bionicle set ever (The first being the Skopio XV-1) First things first though. I will review Lewa Nuva first.

Lewa Nuva-Almost a copy of the Phantoka version. The only piece that looks cool is the Miru Nuva. It looks kind of like a frog, but I still like it. I also like the targeting HUD visor. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Axalara T9-An awesome vehicle. There are three main functions to it: The tri-arms fold out; the midak skyblasters fold out; and the landing gear folds down. If you want to keep it on a shelf with the tri-arms out, put it on the top longways so you can see all of the side, then fold them out. Since the tri-arms go a little past the edge of the shelf (At least with most shelves) so you can fold them out. One problem with the tri-arms though, is that they almost hit Lewa in the head.

     Now for the building and pieces. The build takes about two and a half hours. There was some moments when I felt like quitting then and waiting for the next day because the technic building gets boring. Then, I got on to putting on the large armor pieces. This has many blades, shields, and other kinds of those usual silver pieces including: Nuparu shield halves, Staff of light blades, Matoran electro-blades, Bordakh staffs of loyalty, Kopaka wings, Matoran jet packs, air katana, and Bitl wings in classic red. There are more of those, but I kept seeing more, so I am not going to list any more.

pros:
Very complicated design.
Many interesting pieces.
Midak Skyblasters fold out.
Tri-arms fold out.
landing gear folds out.
HUGE!

cons:
Tri-arms almost hit Lewa
Lewa is copied from the Phantoka version.

This is an awesome set. I highly recommend this to anyone. Even my friend who does not like Bionicle had to admit this is very cool.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"blaksamu12","2011-01-14T18:43:32.093Z","Axalara the Awesome!","<p>Axalara is awesome!&nbsp; With over 600 pieces, its the second largest Bionicle Set ever released (behind Scopio).&nbsp; In my opinion, this is the best Bionicle ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set has an awesome Building Experience.&nbsp; It is not an impossible build, but definitely a challenging one, which makes the set extra awesome.&nbsp; The interior is tricky but really fun to build.&nbsp; The back wings were my favorite part.&nbsp; <strong>Building Experience:&nbsp;5/5</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts are really cool, too.&nbsp; There are 22 possible weapons for Lewa, including the jetpacks.&nbsp; A lot of Technic parts&nbsp;come with the set, so creative minds would have a great time with these pieces.&nbsp; <strong>Parts: 5/5</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Axalara has AMAZING Playability.&nbsp; With the built-in handle, you can zoom Axalara&nbsp;anyway you please.&nbsp; There are two knobs that can be twisted to either fold out the back wings or fold out the Midak Syblasters in the front.&nbsp; The hadle is really a good plus, though, because you can easily hold up the ship to play with it.&nbsp; <strong>Playability: 5/5</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An excellent Value for Money.&nbsp; For $80, which may seem a little pricey, you get a lot for you moneys worth.&nbsp; Luckily, I got Axalara at Toys R' Us on sale for only $60.&nbsp; If you can find him on ebay for $80 or less, its worth it.&nbsp; <strong>Value for Money: 5/5</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lewa is also a great addition to the set.&nbsp; From what I've seen, Lewa is the favorite of the six original toa, so having him in the set is a huge plus.&nbsp; The color scheme of Axalra, the mata red, looks amazing with Lewa driving.&nbsp; You can fold out landing gear in the middle of the ship when putting it down, which look cool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, Axalara is an awesome set.&nbsp; The&nbsp;build is fun and challenging, and the parts are very nice and go well with the set.&nbsp; The playability funcitons are perfect, and Axalara is easily worth the money.&nbsp; Lewa is the coolest, and goes great with ships color scheme.&nbsp; <strong>Overall</strong>, the set gets a <strong>11/10</strong>, for <strong>sheer awesomeness</strong>.</p>

"Nmfrey23","2021-12-27T21:47:05.503Z","Lewa's sweet ride","<p>This vehicle is huge. It&#39;s a sleek looking build with more than enough weapons to deal with any Makuta that Lewa happens across. It&#39;s no wonder&nbsp;he was awestruck when he first saw it. As for the set itself, It&#39;s difficult to find a place to begin. The set has a total of 5 different functions, incudes a figure with a new mask exclusive to this set, and rivals the largest Bionicle set ever (Skopio XV1) in size. This set really is something to behold...</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Contains a full size Lewa figure with a new mask and visor.</p>

<p>Piece count: 2nd most in Bionicle at 693 parts.</p>

<p>Complexity: Very complicated and intricate due to the functions and size of the set.</p>

<p>The vehicle has collapsible landing gear that folds out with the turn of a crank.</p>

<p>Giant three pointed claw on the back can fold and extend with the turn of a crank.</p>

<p>There are two hidden Midak Skyblasters that fold out from the side of the vehicle when a crank is turned. Each blaster holds 4 shots.</p>

<p>There are two more compartments that open up for storage.</p>

<p>There are 24 wing, blade and weapon pieces in this set. The red Bitil Wings are exclusive to this set.</p>

<p>The set has a built-in handle.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lewa&#39;s joints are brittle (applies to all &#39;08-&#39;10 sets)</p>

<p>Crank-related functions can stiffen up if the set is dusty</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you finish building the Axalara T9, you need to take a moment to step back and look at what you&#39;ve built, since the results will certainly be impressive. 5/5</p>
