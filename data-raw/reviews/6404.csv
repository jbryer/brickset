"legoguy_3000_","2008-12-27T08:06:42.483Z","My latest Mistika","This set is a very good set. Its nynrah ghost blaster is like a midak skyblaster but you can only fire one dart at a time. 

pros:
cool wings
cool jets
cool mask
Nynrah ghost blaster really fires

cons:
nothing like a toa Phantoka

great set 4/5

you can combine it with Toa Tahu and Toa Onua to make Trinuma. If you want to get Trinuma I'll just do a tiny review of him:

Trinuma is a good combo.

Pros:
cool blaster
Nynrah ghost blasters really fire
cool mask
cool sheild

Cons:
Bad colour scheme
arm armour does not connect

quite a good combo 4/5

Gali and Gorast were the Bionicles that fought agains each onther in the swamp of Karda Nui. One thing I disklike about Glai is she cant Stand up. Too hard. Water is my favorite Element and I think Silver and Blue are two great Colours, Good work Lego. Be sure to keep up-to-date with Gali and Terihax's scheme.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"brickstud176","2009-10-22T19:40:31.717Z","Yuck","This set is not tastey at all. :(  I dont understad why lego put some things on it. 

         Pro
Great pieces. Sight on gun. Shoulder armor.

        Con
One weapon........ One! And even worse the gun sinks when you shoot it. It goes About 8 inches and falls.
The neck on this bionicle is too short so the mask gets in the way.
No chest armor.

This set was a disapointment. |:(",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-29T16:04:54.56Z","Don't shoot me!","She is just armored to the limit! (Malum has even more!) I heard people saying that both of her hands on the nynrah ghost blaster was a problem, when I just have her carrying it with one hand. Her head I find annoying because, its attached in a way like Onewa Metru, so you cannot move her head upward. The colors also puzzle me because, Toa of Water usually have mostly blue armor, and here, Gali's blue color looks like the secondary color. I don't consider this that bad though because, I like silver. The new Kaukau Nuva looks very robotic and the wings are interesting. The new spiked shoulder armor in my opinion, is awesome! The other cool piece is the targeting piece on the nynrah ghost blaster.

pros:
Interesting pieces.
Fun to pose.
Kaukau Nuva.
Nynrah Ghost Blaster fires very far.
Many silver pieces.

cons:
Not enough blue.
Limited head pose-ability.

She is an okay Toa Nuva, but I recommend Tahu more.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KodakKid365","2010-11-17T00:23:19.29Z","Gali is darn cool.","Gali looks cool and has a good weapon and armor. he is just very cool. I would definatly recommend him to someone. There isn't much else to say. The jet things on his feet are cool. So's his head. 4/5. That's about all I can say.",FALSE,4,4,4,4,4
"Nmfrey23","2022-01-02T01:38:29.057Z","It's just Gali and a blaster against the world","<p>When asked to point to a set that they outright despise, some Bionicle fans may point to the Toa Mistika. For the most part, they don&#39;t look anything like their 2001 &amp; 2002 counterparts, using copious amounts of silver instead of their primary colours. Their weapons and masks also weren&#39;t well liked. However, Gali&nbsp;is often regarded as the worst; a sentiment I share.</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Higher piece count for a canister set.</p>

<p>Mask, blaster, shoulder armour, scope, fins and jets are all new.</p>

<p>Only set where you can get silver Inika legs.</p>

<p>Blaster works well (Holds one shot but comes with two).</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Only weaponry is the blaster-something that all other Mistika sets came equipped with.</p>

<p>Leg pieces and thigh armour keeps the figure from standing up all the way.</p>

<p>Blaster requires both hands to hold due to the scope.</p>

<p>The mask is seriously ugly looking. I rarely say that about masks</p>

<p>Uses smaller Toa Metru feet, creating balance issues.</p>

<p>Overall, I don&#39;t recommend this set unless you either want it or are collecting sets. The &#39;01, &#39;02 or reboot Gali sets are better options. 2/5</p>
