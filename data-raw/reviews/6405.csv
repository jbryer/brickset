"Gus_263","2008-08-07T19:23:57.293Z","Tahu's third generation","This set was released recently and can be found on Shop @t Home and some other stores, but not in all countries. This is the third version (The other are 8534, the original; 8572, the second form) of Toa Tahu, one of the original toa, but the storyline don't matters, the fact that this don't have some likeness with the first one can makes think that this isn't the same. This is released with the subtheme Mistika, with six characters, like in many previous years. This is the leader of the six toa nuva (three phantoka and three mistika) and is like the other leaders, red. But as I said, the story of it don't matters for the 
owner, though it can makes people buy this. 

This set consists in some parts from the newest generation of Bionicle, with different bodies, and without gears, that was cool and was common on the theme. Is hard to make some people thinks that it is lego, but this have the quality of one, and don't have much things for technic as others bionicle had and have, but isn't much what we can waits for a canister set. The common things on the set are the likeness with more action figure than other types of toys, and building ones, but it can be build easily. 

The arms and legs are the same, including the armors and colors, except some increasements on the legs, that are more claws than armors, but can be used for both functions. This have much silver, this color is too included on the other toa Nuva Mistika, Gali and Onua, what makes the silver parts useful to make creations and don't lost the color combinations. On other sets the weapons are more silver, in this, with some arms and legs can be useful too to like the color of the weapons. Altough that, the arms and legs still a bit unuseful to other themes, though the former arms and legs (from the first three years of bionicle) are currently used on Mars mission, Agents and other bionicle things on Castle.

The red things there are more crimsom, darker than old ones (from the first three years), what makes this don't looks like with the former versions of the character. Other things to makes this don't looks like is the weapon of this (named as rotating blades,but this for me looks like a bit with a shuriken, or ninja star). This weapon consists in one piece (that is a bit hard to describe) that fits on a shield from gahlok-kal by a piece known as technic axle pin with 
friction (as in peeron), and so, three blades are connected to this piece and can be rotate on the shield. This weapon isn't a sword, what makes the set lost likeness with the original one, but it don't matters at all. This set have on back connected by two pieces a technic axle joiner perpendicular with 2 holes (as in peeron too) with an inika armor and on it a piece to connects the new matoran of karda nui (suggested to be Solek, but the better could be the red radiak, but this isn't due to the storyline, what don't matter in the set). 

The head is common on the theme and the mask is cool, altough it is crimson, makes it remembers Tahu (the first one, not at all, but I think that it remembers). Another additions are the four jets, that fits well in the body, and can be few moved but it don't frustrates at all the playability like the armors of lesovikk can 
do. Another thing that makes this don't looks like with other Tahu is the nynrah ghost blaster, a big weapon (but don't so big) that is included on Mistika.

This set costs expensive but the lego S@H can be one of the better ways to get it. I know that it is expensive, but have some sets that costs it and don't worth as it, because it have a good pack and the pieces are bigger than some others, and the silver is the same thing of the chrome of the armors of the knights from the set 852271 (from some armors, don't from the sword). This is a bionicle and isn't the better or the worst, have another cheap that were a bit better but this have 73 pieces and is cool as an action figure. Before say that this don't worth, is better see what can be bought with this price. Of course if you dislikes the theme it will not be the best choice, but it don't means that it deserves a bad rate (what ocurred with one Mistika). If you dislike the theme it don't means that the set is bad, but analysing the idea of it (in the case of this set, it was made to be an action figure to be build), it could have a better rate. 

So, this for me will be a 9/10. This don't have combiners on the instructions, the combination with this set is Trinuma, including the three toa Mistika (Trinuma isn't well made as this could be, but this have other ways to combine). So is it, a 4,5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I think that the good things about it are that the jets are very detailed, the ghost blaster actually shoots, the blade spins, and most of the pieces were newly-invented ones (good for customized Bionicles). The bad things about it were that if you spun the blade, it didn't spin very much, and that the blaster doesn't shoot as far as other blasters (like the zamor sphere launcher).

"knuclear200x","2009-04-13T16:42:29.123Z","Burnin' out his fuse out here...","When TRU had a BOGO-50% off deal on ALL LEGO sets last week from today, I tried to partake and did succeed during my previous visit. With money being tight, I had to wait for my paycheck to come in so that I may pick up the other Glatorians. To my surprise...the Glatorians I wanted were not available, as they seemed to have overstocked on Skrall and Tarix. I felt kind of disappointed, but I still had to take advantage of the deal somehow. The only ones I could get was Tarix (because I already have Skrall) and anyone in the Mistika line. As I looked closer at the Toa Tahu, I noticed that this one has four rockets, and I felt that would compliment my collection. And a red Bionicle was something I needed. So I got it.

Pros:
I can't believe I never noticed how cool this guy was. He's been out for a year and I never paid any attention. His main feature is the spinning tri-blade on his right arm. Another cool feature are his claw shins. I guess for someone with rockets, he'll definitely need those. AND the four rockets...oh those are just amazing. They can be rotated about 90 degrees, and the top rockets' airplane fins are a nice touch. No posing problems either. And the helmet has a Storm trooper feel to it. Nice red/silver color combo too.

Cons:
Not much here. The spin-blade is great but I feel that for a guy with rockets, he'd be better off being a gunner. Luckily, I was able to buy another Mistika and used the other's gun with this one. In my opinion it looks a lot better holding two guns.

Others:
I really like how bionicle guns shoot very far. The ones in this line fire light torpedos with an air pump.

Conclusion:
Buy this while they're still out. It's still at the new 12.99 MSRP. You can wait for a clearance sale, but with something this cool you may have to camp out next to your local retailer.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved. On one hand we can see a propeller which sviwels full 360°. The other hand has a nice cannon which shoots very well. On the back you can find some nice jet-packs and a place which you can use to attach a matoran of this theme (for example: set 8947 - Radiak).

"vexorian","2010-01-18T19:47:45.233Z","Pleasant surprise","I was away from LEGO until the end of 2009 so I didn't really notice a lot of sets when they were released. My first impression of Tahu Mistika when seeing pics of him was that it was nothing like Tahu and like all the toa of 2008 he looked more like a decepticon than a toa. So  I didn't think I was going to buy him. That was until I saw more detailed reviews and I noticed it had many silver pieces, specially a silver bohrok shield which I needed for my exo-toa restoration. So I gave him a try. I was pleasantly surprised. I plan getting more mistika.

Pros.
-----
* There are so many goodies for MOCs that you won't believe it . I think that the only way to get so many useful silver parts is to buy a titan, but silver is not all, the jet stuff and wings are great if you want to do some high-tech custom. The blade also uses those unique triple axles which I loved to see in Tuma's wings.
* The last air-based launcher I tried was the Mahri so I thought this launcher was going to suck. It turns out I was wrong. This launcher can really shoot very easily and the bullet is big enough that it doesn't get lost as easily as the Mahri ones, nevertheless there is a backup. What's more is that you actually get to build the launcher's mechanism, that's great. I tried many launchers and this is the second best after the exo-toa (I have not tried the phantoka launchers yet) except maybe since this one is less bulkier and you get to actually build it, Tahu's launcher is better than the exo-toa's). I also like the sound the launcher generates...
* The mask looks much better in person. I now actually do consider it a modernized version of the original Hau.
* LEGO deserves kudos since the Mistika and phantoka actually marked the return of canisters. The Mahri fiasco was awful :(.

Cons
-----
* Rotating blade does not rotate if you attach the bohrok shield too strongly. But if you lose the shield a little, it will remain attached but the blade will spin wonderfully.
* I think that the 2007 joint scare made LEGO a little too conservative. The joints that connect the legs to the torso are looser than other Inika-like characters I've built so far (this is my first 2008 one)
* Does not look like Tahu. However, with all that silver, he does look like 'nuva'.
* Matoran combiner requires Tahu to have a strange looking part in the back. Just remove it.

---
Basically, if you can find this set at a price lower than or equal to the original price, get it. Specially if you can get a discount. Even if you didn't like the design, if you are a Mocer you won't regret the purchase.

"Nmfrey23","2022-06-05T22:30:56.557Z","While it may not look like the Tahu I know, this is a cool set","<p>I was a bit late to develop interest in Bionicle as a whole (around 2012). When I began to look back at G1 sets and see if there were any that I found interesting. The Mistika wave in 2008 caught my attention for a few reasons. I thought that they were some of the most interesting looking sets, and I also noticed that the six sets (mostly the three Toa) weren&#39;t exactly revered by longtime fans of the series. So, I decided to see what the Toa sets were all about since opinions on them were so varied. While I didn&#39;t end up liking Gali very much, Tahu and Onua were pleasant surprises to me. Despite not looking much like Tahu, this set was a&nbsp;very creative build&nbsp;that I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New parts: Jet engines, wings, claws, fan blades, blaster, air pump, and ammo are all new pieces. There are also many parts that are new in silver like the piraka legs.</p>

<p>Overall look: While this set looks nothing like Tahu, I think the set still looks awesome. The quad jet engines and the wing pieces make this set look very complete without relying on many armour shell pieces.</p>

<p>Piece count: This is the largest canister set from Bionicle with 73 parts. Of these parts, there are some pretty cool ones (mostly in silver), making this set a good choice for MOCing.</p>

<p>Functions: This set has three functions. The first is a connection block that allows a Matoran to attach to Tahu&#39;s back. The second is his three-bladed weapon which is able to spin rapidly. Lastly, Tahu wields a ghost blaster which works well (holds one shot but comes with two).</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Some may dislike the copious number of silver parts. After all, Tahu is a Toa of Fire, not a Toa of Silver.</p>

<p>Tahu is somewhat of a hunchback in his Mistika set, limiting head movement.</p>

<p>Some may dislike the mask (be that it doesn&#39;t resemble Tahu&#39;s Hau mask or that it just looks bad). I personally think that this mask is serviceable compared to Gali&#39;s, but I&#39;m not the biggest fan of it.</p>

<p>Brittle Joints (applies to all 08&#39;-10&#39; sets).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the bad rep that the Toa Mistika have garnered, I think that they are still solid sets (for the most part). Tahu Mistika looks very cool when completed, and I think that this set is definitely worth a try. 4/5</p>
