I mean, what was I thinking when I got this? I must've been daydreaming, and accidentally picked it out instead of a Star Wars set I originally wanted to get. It was only when I got home that I discovered it was a Bionicle set. So I built it to see what it was like, and saw if I liked it or not. It turned out I hated it so much I took apart the entire set, put it into storage for the pieces to rot, and cried for six hours so loud the neighbours came to see what was going on. Then I cried for an additional three hours knowing my next Lego set would be during Christmas, which is almost five months away. I gave this set a one out of five(I have to give it a rating or it won't submit) but if I had my way I would simply give it a zero.   ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

Pros:
- Cool mask
- Shoulder shield
- Nyrah Ghost blaster actually works quite well
- Chest plate
- Tall

Cons:
- Red jets kinda ruin the scene

Apart from the red jets, this Bionicle is awesome and is highly recommended.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-08-05T21:07:35.81Z","I don't know why say it is too bad","First, this set was recently released, is one of the newest Bionicle released. Onua is a set from the Mistika theme. This theme have six sets (Krika, Gorast, Bitil, Onua, Tahu and Gali), and each set can bet bought by US$12.99. The price of the sets from some series released before this (such as Phantoka, Mahri, Barraki and Inika) was a bit cheaper, the sets could be bought by US$9,99. 

I don't know why the price changed, but I think that some Bionicle sets still being cool at least. Ok, very different in comparison with other Lego sets, but the Bionicle are building action figures, not building sets with bricks. Due to it they are different in comparison with other Lego themes, such as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, City, Mars Mission and several others. 

I personally likes it, it have basically no much problems, but have some problems like the price and it is very simple, even for a Bionicle figure.

This set is Toa Onua, the third version of Onua, one of the main characters from the storyline. The first version, the smaller one (8532 &quot;Onua&quot;) was released in 2001, the first year of the Bionicle theme. The second, have some notable changes altough have so much resemblances (8566 &quot;Onua Nuva&quot;) with the first. The second was released in the late 2002 year. And this is the third. In size and playability this is very different from his former versions. In the storyline, Toa Onua, of earth, got his adaptive armor and went to the swamp to fight the Makuta and to find the kanohi Ignika, the mask of life. 

The Mistika series have three Makuta and three Toa Nuva, being the Makuta: 
8694 Krika, 8695 Gorast and 8696 Bitil
and the three Toa Nuva:
8688 Toa Gali, 8689 Toa Tahu, 8690 Toa Onua
Like in the Phantoka series, the Mistika series is a collection with six sets, being three the Toa Nuva (the &quot;good guys&quot; of the storyline)and three Makuta (the &quot;bad guys&quot; of the storyline). For more information about the storyline you can visit sites like the BZPower or biosector01, or if you wish only to get information about the sets, just search at the brickset's database, and you will have easy access to the sets numbers and more. I don't like the Bionicle storyline, for me it is poor, but I like some sets.

So, what matter now is the set.
The set contains 62 pieces, not so much for a Bionicle set with this size, but a good use for some pieces.
The Onua's feet have the same form and colors of the Hewkii's feet in the set 8912 (Toa Hewkii), being really useful. The Onua's legs are silver coloured, a good colour, the silver pieces were common among the whole Bionicle theme since 2002, but this year you can find so much silver pieces than before. This &quot;silver&quot; colour is the same chrome colour that you can find at the current Castle sets (with the knights minifigures, some weapons and armors). The Legs have also some increasements, two &quot;jet rockets&quot; (as the storyline says, the red coloured pieces fixed in the back of his legs are jet rockets), that are very cool in shape, playability and are also useful. It is basic for a Bionicle figure, but it have useful pieces and like the other Bionicle figures with this size, it have a great playability, like an action figure.

The Onua's body don't show much innovations and building, but still playable and made by useful pieces, of course. His armor is very small, I expected a bulky armor for him, because in the storyline this is one of the strongest characters. But still, it isn't really bad. The colour scheme of the set is basically made by silver, gray and black (the main color). Wich is actually very nice in terms of quality and visual. 

The arms are also basic, but have some increasements, like the two small pieces with shapes of small red wings, in each arm, and a &quot;multi-resistant shield&quot; (as the storyline says), that is very notable at the left arm. The shield looks like to limit his playability, but it is too distant from the body, that you don't lost playability of the set only by this armor (well, it don't looks like to be a shield more than an armor).

The head have a short piece with green color, used as the eyes. The color is very nice, and it is also very useful. The mask is a bit odd, but I think it is very good in design, at least different. The mask fix very well with the head, and the clor makes it very cool. The mask is called in the storyline as &quot;Kanohi Pakari Nuva&quot;, the mask of strength. The character don't looks like very strong, but if you read a Bionicle comic (number 3 of preference) you can see that this character is very strong. I personally don't saw much resemblances with the Darth Vader's helmet, only about the color. The eyes don't have a visor and have a much different shape, the spaces for the eyes are big in comparison with several other masks. I have to say, it is a bit odd, but is creative, the Bionicle figures have some notable differences, and must have notable differences, it is what makes them creative (at least a bit creative).

The weapon is a &quot;Nynrah ghostblaster&quot;, a weapon that launches a small shot by a pump air piece that is connected on it's back. It works very well, can be launched easily at long distances. The nynrah ghostblaster in this set is equipped with a black piece that have a laser at the front, to make it a bit more cool. 

I personally think this set could be a bit more increased in terms of pieces (armors), and a bit more increased in terms of wepaons (the first bionicle sets had more attack weapons than firing weapons, like the nynrah ghostblaster, basically the only weapon of this new Onua). This third version of Onua is very different than it's two early versions (8532 and 8566), I think this could be also more cheap and could had a bit more resemblances with the old two versions. But this set still nice in playability and useful pieces.

Overall, I reccomend it to Bionicle fans, because it is a good set (you cannot expect a thing like a set by US$30 in a set by US$12.99, this is an strong example). About the Lego fans who dislikes any Bionicle related things, I personally don't dislike, but I have to say, Bionicle aren't that bad, are just different. The Bionicle sets are action figures made by pieces. So, you don't have to say they're very bad for a Lego. So, here is my Pros and Cons about the set:

Pros:
Well designed mask
Useful pieces (to Bionicle and a bit for technic themes)
Great playability
62 pieces
Awesome colour scheme

Cons:
Basic
Only one weapon (the Nynrah Ghostblaster)
A bit pricey


It is around a 4,6. For a action figure with building capacibility, I think it isn't that bad. Basic, of course, but as I said, you cannot expect a thing like a set by US$30 in a set by US$12.99 so, it is very good.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy_3000_","2008-11-02T10:26:02.403Z","A very good set","This set is a very good set. Its nynrah ghost blaster is like a midak skyblaster but you can only fire one dart at a time. 

pros:
cool wings
cool sheild
cool jets
cool mask
Nynrah ghost blaster really fires

cons:
nothing like a toa Phantoka

great set 4/5

you can combine it with Toa Tahu and Toa Gali to make Trinuma. If you want to get Trinuma I'll just do a tiny review of him:

Trinuma is a good combo.

Pros:
cool blaster
Nynrah ghost blasters really fire
cool mask
cool sheild

Cons:
Bad colour scheme
arm armour does not connect

quite a good combo 4/5

"beyoda","2009-07-23T23:40:28.78Z","Surprisingly Good","Picked Onua here up the other day, along with Tahu and Kopaka, and, I have to say, Onua was the pleasant surprise of the bunch.  The colour scheme is actually quite good and fun to look at, and the mask makes him look like the awesomely beastly toa of earth that he is.  After rooting around in my collection, I found parts to give him another shield on the other arm, and I recommend the same to everyone else, as it adds a lot to the set.  While I don't like Lego giving shields to all these toa of earth, Onua here actually does look really good.  5 out of 5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-11-03T15:58:51.937Z","Unusual colors","Onua's colors, black, silver, and--what? Classic red? This is very unusual indeed! His wings and jets sort of stick out, but I do not care much.This actually helps out with those screaming red pins. I really like his type of chest armor. In my opinion, it works very well in conjunction with the Toa Metru chest cover. The new Pakari Nuva distantly resembles the old Pakari Nuva, which is good for older fans to bring back memories. The nynrah ghost blaster guard looks very cool and is good for MOCs. You can fit the nynrah ghost blaster on his back by just putting it there, no modifications. I like where they put the jets, on the back of his legs, because he can shoot strait up in the air. The designers must have wanted a different place to put his shield, because I love it! He can take it off his shoulder and use it as a shovel.

pros:
Classic red.
Shield is on his shoulder.
Kanohi Pakari Nuva.
Chest armor.
Nynrah Ghost Blaster with guard.

cons:
none.

Onua is in my opinion, is in third place for the Mistika. He is a must-have for Toa Nuva fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
