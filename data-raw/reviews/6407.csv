This set was released recently, as a summer set from the Bionicle theme and Mistika subtheme. Like all the other Bionicle sets, Krika is a buildable action figure. And like the other Mistika sets, this set shows a good playability, though have no much pieces and complexity in building like the &quot;warriors&quot; sets (big action figures of the Bionicle theme. &quot;Warriors&quot; is a subtheme).

The pieces included are very useful, but some pieces are a bit odd even for a buildable action figure. For example, Krika uses as his forearms some pieces that were used as the matorans' (matorans are small sets from the Bionicle theme) legs and arms in 2008. These pieces (black colored included with Krika) are useful to make small limbs, and to make increasings in some titans' structures, but aren't very good in terms of playability if it won't be increased by any other piece.

The Krika's main color scheme is white, black and red. His mask (called in the Bionicle storyline as &quot;Kanohi Crast&quot;, the mask of repulsion) is very well designed and is very cool too, due to its nice color scheme. But in some sets like the Toa Metru, Toa Inika, Piraka, Mahri and Toa Nuva, this mask cannot be placed as regular masks. And also, the Krika's head isn't made like the &quot;regular&quot; Bionicle heads (regular means most common among the sets), so the mask is only useful in this set. But if you want to use his mask in other figures, you have to use his long neck too, making it a bit odd. 

This white color is a bit transparent, different from the common white scheme, but is a nice detail, also because in the storyline, Krika can turn invisible. His blades (or paws) are connected in each limb, making it bigger. These blades are new from this season, being included with this color only in this set, but being useful to any white, black or red Bionicle figure. The playability isn't like the playability of most regular figures, because it don't have a connection to put another weapon, and because he don't have feet (like the Vamprah set, 8692). So he must be supported only with his four blades (or paws).

The Krika's body is the same used as the Makutas' bodies (Makuta Phantoka, the sets 8691, 8692 and 8693), but this set don't have a Tridax pod (Tridax pod is a orange colored weapon that the Makuta Phantoka launches from their chests), he have a white piece used as an armor of his chest. 

This set is very simple, includes only 40 pieces, but is very well designed and of course playable. His head have a small neck (bigger than the necks of the most common Bionicle figures) connecting it to his body. And in his back, he have a piece with ball joint connecting a &quot;Nynrah ghostblaster&quot;. The nynrah ghostblaster is a blaster that really fires, and launches one shot by time. It is easy to launch, you have just to push the red piece on the blaster's back. It don't shoots very good like the Midak skyblaster, and launches just one shot, but is more soft than the Midak skyblaster in terms of weight. 

The building isn't complex, it is very easy, you only have to connect the limbs by the ball joints, and somethings with the technic axles. 

It is available currently in the Lego stores (Or Lego Shop @t home) or in some toy stores, like Toys R' Us. In some countries without Lego shop at home or Toys R' Us (like here in Brazil), it will come in this month or in october probably.

Overall, this set features some cool details in the design, have a nice color scheme and good playability. But I personally expected more of building from this insect-like Makuta. If you are a Bionicle fan or a Bionicle collector, this set is recommended. But as this set have only 40 pieces and costs US$ 12,99 , maybe you will not buy this by questions like worthness.

"knuclear200x","2009-04-13T17:52:44.903Z","Get away from her, you bricks!","I've personally learned that not all Bionicles look cool like the package. Seeing them out of the box is sometimes the only way I can determine whether I want to buy it or not. I went to a TRU for that BOGO-50% sale they had last weekend, and noticed how cool it looked out of the box, and decided it would be part of my purchase.

Pros:
This thing is one bad-donkey quadruped. As you can see, it has blades for hands and feet. Another thing, is its Xenomorph-like mask, remember that movie ""Alien""? And instead of a hollow skull with the light-piping brain/eye/something piece, the skull is just that ball socket connector with the transparent, half-oval eye-piece things on each side.
The bionicle is very pointy but nothing to label as an actual hazard. Poseability gets a full score as well...well, almost full...like -.5 points.

Cons and fixes:
The chest piece and ball-socket connector (that makes part of the neck) is very wobbly, and there weren't other pieces included to hold them so you better have some spare parts to spare. The elbows and knees aren't poseable neither. And the initial finishing product looks great, but looks boring after a while. In my opinion, some wings or extra horns would've been nice. But I found I nicer, spikier solution to this:

Instead of having ""swords"" for hands, just put each half of the sword on the hands (facing frontwards) and feet (facing backwards). As for the foot claws, put them on the elbows' cross-holes with the four spikes facing upward. Now you have a four-legged spider-walker that shoots thunderbolts from its elbow horns...or something.

Another thing that seems out of place is the gun. I think the figure is too cool to need a gun, so I just gave it to the Toa Tahu.

Conclusion:
Awesome design, a menacing-looking mask, a lot of spikey blades to use make it an awesome bionicle. The wobbly pieces are a minor problem, and don't affect posing but having extra holding parts will be useful.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Alemas","2010-02-28T14:35:32.763Z","To be honest, it's not that great...","<p>Usually, Bionicle sets are great. Not this one. I'll explain why:</p>
<h4>Building Experience</h4>
<p>I'm a quick builder, and it takes about... 6 minutes for me to build canister Bionicle sets. Same goes for this: 6 minutes of build time. Nothing special to say. 4/5</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Well, we get a cool mask, dagger-like legs, and a Nynrah Ghost Blaster. Not a lot. 3/5</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>Ouch. This is where it suffers. Its quadruped design, coupled with those terribly thin legs, makes this very unstable. It frequently tips on its side. The Ghost Blaster works pretty well though, but doesn't save this set. 2/5</p>
<h4>Value for money</h4>
<p>Well, I'm no expert, but judging from Brickset's mentioned price(&pound;7.79), it's not so good for what you get. 3/5</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>Not so good. Its main problem are those legs, and its limited selection of special parts make this set not very good. Get one of the other Mistika if you're not interested in collecting ALL Bionicle canister sets. 3/5<br />

He is pretty cool once you get to those Av-Matoran limbs and his problem of stability. (I will explain later) Krika's good side is his cool pieces and Interesting Torso. The long legs are very cool with the blended white and red. The back legs are smaller than the front legs, but I like them more. The Kanohi Crast also has the same color scheme as the legs and is very cool. The chest armor is a rare pieces to come by.The nynrah ghost blaster is held by an arm that  like the normal arms, can only be moved from two points of articulation.

pros:
Cool Kanohi.
Blended legs
Chest armor.
Nynrah Ghost Blaster.

cons:
not much articulation.

"Nmfrey23","2022-06-04T03:21:21.053Z","Skeletal. Menacing. Perfect.","<p>Even in a wave of villain sets full of unique characters, Krika easily stands apart from the other 5 Makuta, both for his heart of gold (typically not a trait found in villains) and his unique canister set. Meant to look like a mantis, this skeletal Makuta was a huge surprise on first build. Despite only containing 40 parts, the set is massive and&nbsp;looks amazing upon completion. Without a doubt, Krika&nbsp;is my favourite of both the Makuta Phantoka and Mistika.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New parts: The mask, launcher, air pump, ammo, torso armour, arm blades, and leg blades are all new parts.</p>

<p>Build &amp; Stature: Despite only being 40 parts, Krika towers over the other canister sets from 2008 when stood straight up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall look: This set is menacing looking. The spines are reminiscent of bones, and the mask appears skull-like. Additionally, the translucent while pieces with red in their centres mesh well with the black pieces and compliment the evil look very well. In addition, while Krika can&#39;t move as much as some other sets due to his unique build, he can move and pose in ways that only he can.</p>

<p>This set features two functions. The first is a connector block found on Krika&#39;s back that allows a Matoran to attach. The second function is a shoulder mounted ghost blaster. The blaster works well (holds 1 shot but comes with 2) and can be aimed quite well since it&#39;s supported by two ball joints. This also lets the blaster fold away onto Krika&#39;s back.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Krika generally has poor balance since he&#39;s essentially supported by pins and needles 24/7.</p>

<p>The set sacrifices some movement in the arms and legs in favour of the custom build.</p>

<p>As cool as the mask is, it cannot fit onto standard Bionicle head blocks.</p>

<p>Krika&#39;s neck and ghost blaster are wobbly (both are attached to the same axle).</p>

<p>Brittle joints (applies to al 08&#39;-10&#39; sets).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One picture of this set can&#39;t do the size and details present within it service. Despite the misleading piece count, this set gives you a giant figure that looks incredible. If you were to look for this set, try to find a disassembled copy. The surprise and satisfaction after finishing a build is one of my favourite aspects about LEGO, and this set will certainly provide that despite being only 40 parts. 5/5&nbsp;</p>
