"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-17T08:44:53.997Z","Not the best","This set isn't a very good set.  Its nynrah ghost blaster is like a midak skyblaster but you can only fire one dart at a time.  

pros:
cool claws
nynrah ghost blaster really fires

cons:
nothing like a Makuta Phantoka
wings bend easily 
mask is made of rubber
shortest limbs possible
the claws on its upper arms are silver

I think this set isn't very good 3/5

This set was released recently, in some countries it is being released this or in the next month. As a bionicle set of course it have different building and too ideas, as action figures. The pieces too, not much to expect for technic sets in comparison with bigger bionicle sets, but it still useful to both bionicle and technic.

It have too a storyline, as the title shows, Gorast is a she, though it don't looks very well. But have too explanations to her current form, as a mutation from the swamp of secrets. But you don't need to know the storyline to want the set or know it's name, it isn't necessary.

One weapon included in this set are included too in the others of the subtheme, called Nynrah ghost blaster, it really fires, though one shot by one time, it is easy to launch and build. The body is like one of a toa inika, but this gives the place to put four arms, and too to conect a matoran (from 2008).

The limbs are short, being the arms or the legs, they consists in arms from 08' matoran (like the arms of tanma, in the same color) connected to balljoints. The legs have short connectors of ball joints, what can't make her be very tall as some other makuta from Karda Nui. The feet were used too as claws in two arms, and are really useful as they can make the figure taller (this wasn't the case of gorast, though that, she keeps in feet). The other arms have other types of claws and cool wings, that moves well, but not so well as the Icarax's wings.

The head is a bit different, connected by a small arm from toa metru to a hand, it is connected in the hand along with the eyes (started in the bohrok sets). After all, it is really playable, if with care, but keeps a good and very playable set as other Bionicle sets. 

About colors, it is cool, though it wasn't so colorful as other green sets were, it have black, gray and lime green, but no evidences of the classic green or dark green, what makes it useful to current sets but not so much to green sets, more because it have the arms as few pieces with few connection, though in a different way of the others.

If it worth or not, it is a hard question. As example, it have the same price of the Castle Battle packs when they were released, so if you want an action figure, of course get this instead of the castle pack, but if you  want a pack, of course pick the pack and not this only to put a bad rate. The cost don't worth so much as other bionicle sets costed, but comparing with some current Lego sets (as example the castle battle packs), it will worth a bit. 

Here are my basic pros and cons:
 - Pros:
-Cool looking of the set (though not to female character, it still good), have well designed parts, like the wings and claws
-Useful parts to 08' Bionicle sets and to recent sets like from 2006 
-Nynrah ghost blaster really fires
-The limbs are made in a different way
 - Cons:
-Colors are useful to 08', though that, it isn't very good to other sets from other years
-Limbs are too short
-Mask isn't the best, wings can't move as in other sets, but it'ts playability is average 

In overall, it is close to 4/5, as an action figure, or if you want it to parts like limbs (though short they are six in this set).

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-21T17:12:21.39Z","My favorite Makuta for 2008... except for Vamprah","I like the insectoid look about Gorast. She looks like a wasp, what with those hypnotizing wings of hers.  Anyway, enough of this chit chat. Pros and Cons coming up.

Pros:

Hypnotizing wings

Waspy all over

Nynrah blaster

Head is cool

Cons:

Claws sometimes fall off one of her hands

Rather awkward place to put the wings

Other than those two cons, I still have to rate Gorast a five out of five.  Get her before she gets discontinued when the Glatorians come out in January!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Dragon_Master_48","2012-06-01T22:39:06.29Z","Never Underestimate Gorast...","<p>Gorast is the green Mistika canister set, and sets the record as being the first four-armed canister set,&nbsp;the first female Makuta in set form, and the first (and only) female canister set to not have blue as her main color.</p><p>Anyway, onto the Pros and Cons:</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-04-06T23:35:34.923Z","That's the strangest-looking bug I've ever seen...","<p>I&#39;m going to review another old set of mine today. Today it&#39;s my first Bionicle, 8695 Gorast.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions<br />
The box is a canister with a lid vaguely resembling the Mask of Life. I remember getting really frustrated trying to open this thing. The instructions are small and have terrible color differentiation, as usual for a $13 Bionicle set of this era.</p>

<p>Parts<br />
The parts are a varied bunch, with a rubber mask, super-rare wing pieces, and six claw pieces. We get an Inika-build torso and a whole bunch of angular limb pieces in lime. All the sockets are very, very fragile... I don&#39;t think a single ball cup has lasted the 6 1/2 years. Neither has the mask... both the nose and cross axle have snapped off over time. BOO.</p>

<p>The build<br />
The build takes much longer than you&#39;d expect, because I had one heck of a time squeezing the joints and axles together. Also, it had the feeling like the parts were going to snap and go flying across the room, which was very discouraging.</p>

<p>The completed model<br />
At first glance, this is a very sweet figure, with four arms, claws, wings, and a firing blaster. Unfortunately, the arms don&#39;t have elbows, the wings are very flimsy, and the blaster is the stupidest gun I&#39;ve ever seen in a LEGO set, squid launcher included. The air pump doesn&#39;t work at all and gets parts stuck inside and the ammo feels like a dollar-store knockoff.</p>

<p>Overall opinion<br />
I don&#39;t know what I was thinking when I got this. Lesson re-learned... packaging can provide a very good sense of the set. Don&#39;t buy this set. Just... don&#39;t.</p>

"Nmfrey23","2022-01-13T16:40:04.65Z","Glad that actual mosquitoes aren't this big","<p>While the first half of 2008&#39;s Makuta took inspiration from bats, the second half took inspiration from bugs. Each of the Makuta Mistika have unique builds tailored to the creature they are supposed to represent. Gorast, meant to look like a mosquito, has two sets of arms, large transparent wings and a sharp needle sticking out of her mask. These features help the set stand out in a cast of Makuta that already look about as different from one and other as they can.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New parts: Claws (both silver and black), blaster pieces, holographic wings and rubber mask are all new.</p>

<p>Unique torso build to accommodate extra arms.</p>

<p>Blaster works well (holds one shot but comes with two).</p>

<p>Wings can move. As a side note, the wings also have a very odd texture. The hexagonal pattern almost appears 3D.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall movement is clunky; arms and legs are pre-bent.</p>

<p>Wrist movement is limited on lower arms.</p>

<p>Mask is incompatible with all Bionicle head blocks (Gorast&#39;s head is a custom build).</p>

<p>This is a personal issue I have with the set. The torso is grey, and the upper claws are silver. They could have likely been made in black/lime green instead.</p>

<p>Brittle joints (applies to all 08&#39;-10&#39; sets).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, Gorast is an interesting looking canister set. Despite the limited movement the set has, I&#39;d recommend it regardless. 4/5.</p>
