The feet are really cool, but my favourite piece is the mask. Also the wings are pretty cool too, but there's just something that makes him not as cool as others. I don't know what it is but he just seems kinda lame when standing next to Onua Mistika. Something else I don't like is that stupid Nyrah ghostblaster. I can't believe how dumb it is. For those reasons, Bitil gets a 4/5. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"water_jedi_17","2008-09-16T22:16:54.2Z"," “You against me? The odds are against you... because I never fight one on one... and time is on my side.”"," Bitil is a wild card when it comes to rating him.He has the most pieces of the mistika makuta yet looks quite simple.
 Bitil has an interesting head, a black vakhi head and two slanted eyes beneath his mask.On his two arms are two red spines/thorns.Those pieces add an unfair raise in pieces compare to the price.What I like about Bitil are the two wings on his back that resemble a beetle.Two daggers and a nynrah ghost blaster are his weapons.The blaster is quite nice and simple to use(you just press the red piece in the back).The legs are quite strange since they resemble his daggers.What I think is unnesacary are the two blades that come otu his legs.On his back is an l shaped piece to place Gavla.
 I recommend this set to those who like rare bionicle colors(yellow) and for those who collect makuta.I  like his insect like design although in my opinion bitil doesn't look as cool as Krika who has a spider alien look.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-11-05T15:20:02.607Z","Makuta Bitil !","This set was released in summer this year, but I got it in one or two months later. As a medium-sized set, isn't much what we can expect of contents, but playability and design is very necessary.

The color scheme is great, though it replaces the old brown and tan, yellow still a great color, too for the stone element, at least better than orange. 

The box of the set shows a Kanohi Ignika with scars in one side, but other side is clean in the back. The building instructions don't shows much things, no combiners and no announces of Bionicle.com, the official site of the product. But it still good to build.

The first part to build is the body, very small (included in 08' matoran), that is good to playability, but bad to some sets. It have too the common connections, the arms and legs are the same (this relation of arm/leg is repeated in every single Mistika set, and this includes the rahkshi legs in yellow color). It have too a smaller connection to the head (it is a vahki one, inverted to the other side), and the mask is putted above, and it keeps well in the head due to the technic axle connecting the eyes by the holes of the mask.

Another connection in this set is on it's back, connected to the body by technic axle with studs, and it keeps too the place to the piece that will connects Bitil to Gavla or another 08' matoran. But this connection to matoran isn't needed. It have too two arms in the back connected, that makes structures of the wings, only adding hands to keeps those new armor/shield pieces included in some Mistika and in some vehicles.

It's playability in overall is great, this can moves the arms, legs, hands, feet (that are a new piece), the head (and too the neck!) and the wings. The building, as I said, isn't much to expect, but the pieces, good to any bionicle set, though his body isn't so good. But it have too useful pieces to technic. The worst problem are the armors. This practically have no armors, but claws used as armors in the legs, and spikes in the arms. What is most near to be armors in this set are the wings.

But in what it don't have armors, the weapons worth, two very nice designed blades, that fits very well too in titans/warriors. And the Nynrah Ghost blaster, it don't shots very well as the Midak, but at least is better to be carried by a Bionicle figure. I recommend to use the Nynrah blaster with the current Bionicle sets, after the 05' sets. It at least is a weapon made of more than one piece, but include only two shots.

In comparison with Bionicle sets, it is good as action figure and in design, but a bit bad in pieces, but if you want it to compare with sytem, buy a Exo-force, to mix up System with Bionicle, seriously it isn't impossible, and can do great results. I know, it don't worth in quantity of pieces, but looking at some sets like the Knights' battle pack, it will worth. For me, it is the best Makuta. And in the recent Bionicle sets, Lego did a game of market:
Onua have hidden classic colors, Tahu have more pieces, Gali have better armours, Krika a nice design, Gorast have more connection to limbs, and Bitil, better weapons.
Of course they have their cons, but with them all, it will be very good to make better creations and modifications.

So, this is a 5/5.
Though it costs a bit expensive, I got it for like two times the price in US and I thought it worth, don't have much to complain about this.    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy_3000_","2008-10-28T14:34:13.31Z","Krika is better","This set is a very good set. Its nynrah ghost blaster is like a midak skyblaster but you can only fire one dart at a time. 

pros:
cool blades
cool wings
cool mask
nynrah ghost blaster really fires

cons:
nothing like a Makuta Phantoka

great set 4/5
