 skyfighter:The most visible weapon is a midak blaster from the phantoka line.The total ammo is 8,making me wonder if lego just added those pieces to raise the piece count.There are flaps to protect the ammo or to reveal them depending on how you want it to look.It also comes with four of kopaka's wings and two of gali's mask fins while the front is shaped like a dagger.The sky fighter lacks colors with only gray and black elements.Vutraz is also plain in color. 
  This set isn't really the best and I don't recommend it.It doesn't have complex features like the jetrax T6 and the other battle vehicles.According to a few people you can pair him with gorast,but I don't own her.

"legoguy2805","2008-10-20T15:27:13.623Z","Vultraz, Shadow Matoran","This is Vultraz and his skyfighter. Vultraz turned evil 5 years ago when he was a Ta-Matoran. He killed his teacher and began killing innocent Matoran. He was going to kill a Ko-Matoran called Mazeka until Mazeka thrust back and Vultraz fell off a cliff. He survived, and Gorast re-made his armour so no one would recognise him. He planted a sound bomb in a De-Matoran village, then invaded it. He and Mazeka was looking for a De-Matoran called Krakua. Vultraz was just about to kill Mazeka, but stopped. Vultraz visited a Fe-Matoran who modified his skyfighter. Sometime later Icarax turned him into a Shadow Matoran. Mazeka is Vultraz's arch-enemy.

"Vrahno","2009-07-27T08:11:20.577Z","Nifty little set, definitely not outstanding, though","I bought this set solely because I am something of a completist. The vehicle never impressed much from pictures, nor did I find its role in the storyline all that interesting (it barely appears for minutes before being destroyed). But I managed to find it at a nice price, so it hopped into my basket.

The rider of the vehicle, Vultraz, is nothing but your standard 2008-style Matoran, composed almost entirely of pieces utilizing the ball and socket connectors. Nothing special, although the mask is a neat piece, and fits the character rather well. But the overall model looks somewhat boring with its whole body being all dark red. In fact the only color variation comes from its trans-orange head and the black-toned mask.
But if you like Vultraz (as I do), I guess it's not bad, and a new character is always welcome to anyone's collection. MOCers can also find one or two useful pieces on him.

The focus of this set however is undoubtedly the vehicle, simply called the sky-fighter. While definitely a menacing looking thing with an interesting concept, the finished model looks really bland. It's covered in all sorts of wings and smaller thrusters, so you can tell it's supposed to represent some kind of flying craft... But aside from those, it looks like it could be anything. In fact, the whole apparatus is basically a giant cannon with an ammo-holder on top of it, and some appendage that looks somewhat like a seat... oh, and wings.
Say what you will, but  this model simply does not make me go ""Ooh!"" and ""Aah!"". It's okay for a small set and for a relatively minor character, but in all honestly, to me, it looks like random spare parts put together to form an elongated shape, trying to imitate a flyer, with absolutely nothing covering the red and blue colored connector pieces. The bulk of the vehicle comes from the Midak Skyblaster cannon and its ammunition storage, otherwise it's a bare mechanical skeleton that appears to be still WIP, yet isn't. We have all seen the color-scheme before: black and light gray/silver. But in this case, these two shades don't flow too well with each other, and the gray and silver are seemingly put on it at random, rather crudely. Not at all elegant, though to be fair, I assume elegance wasn't in mind of its creator. This is, after all, a FIGHTER. And it looks the part.

But it has trouble standing.


Thus, my final verdict on this set is 3 or 3.5 out of 5. Not bad... but not that great either. Get it if you're a collector, like the character, need parts, or if you happen to like it more than I do. Overall it isn't outstanding, but then, what did I expect from such a small set that is literally overshadowed by its bigger cousins, the T3, T6, and T9?


As for the pros and cons? Here is my subjective list:

Pros:
* Vultraz is a cool character, if you follow the story
* If you don't, he still has a new mask
* The ammo-storage is nice, and it comes in handy if you happen to lose some Midak/Zamor bullets
* The set is a nice pack of parts
* Fast build
* I have to confess, the set looks kinda cool, even wicked from certain angles
* It's... it's Bionicle, heh

Cons:
* Both of the models look bland and boring
* The builds are likewise nothing to get excited about
* No new pieces aside from Vultraz's mask
* The jet can barely stand
* Due to the design of the sky-fighter's controller bars, the pilot wobbles from side to side
* The vehicle looks like a mediocre MOC, albeit a better one at that
* The blue pins are absolutely, positively, definitely visible all over it
* It doesn't have a big importance in the story, although that is not the set's fault (but it is for me an important aspect)
* Unimaginative color-schemes for both of the models

I know I sound kind of harsh, so apologies for that. I don't hate this set, I am simply not blown away by it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
