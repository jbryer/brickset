This set was released recently, along with the six Mistika sets, another warrior (Vultraz), and the Vehicles, but as a warrior. As an action figure, it have great playability, and as it is a big set, it have more useful pieces, not only to the Bionicle theme (even useful for Technic), and is too bigger than regular Bionicle sets.

It have a storyline, but it isn't necessary, though it can be a reason to some people buys it. In the story, this is the current version of Takanuva (released in 2003 as 8956), that survived from an attack of shadow leeches, and now is bigger, with more powers, that he adquired through the story. It still have likeness with his first form, with very much white pieces, and with only armors and his mask (Kanohi Avohkii)featuring different color, in his first version they were golden, now it is gunmetal (what makes it looks that he was attacked by shadow leeches).
A very interesting and important piece is the new version of his mask (kanohi Avohkii), with a &quot;gunmetal&quot; color, this is well detailed and resembles the original mask.

Building:
-Body
Starting from the body, it have three technic bars on the back, that can keeps easily the body used in the Inika sets. On the front, it have only two bars. The head is putted differently in the front, a technic axle size 3 with a stud is putted in a hole of the inika body, and a ball joint with a technic connector (with two ball sockets) in one side, to in other, his head with mask.

-Legs
To connect the legs, a technic connector block with two ball joints (known more as the main piece to make the legs of the Visorak sets) is connected to the bars and it's balljoints, to the legs. The legs have a good system to put a piece used as the arms of Pohatu Phantoka, though it have the same system to keeps the legs connected to the bodies as Icarax. As the armor to the leg is long, a technic liftarm 1x7 with fan (used in the set 8501, Ski Slizer or throwbot) fits very well. The same piece keeps too the lower part of the leg. This piece in each leg is used four times, in the lower part, fits well two bionicle hands and one balljoint in each piece to makes it moves well, and too with a piece (used as the lower arms of toa Hordika) to connects with the foot.

-Feet
As a big sized set, this have to keep in feet by pneumatics, connected in the upper part of the leg to a hand of the foot, next to the leg connected in the same foot. The feet are all big, but well designed and built, have two bars in the sides and too blades (in each side) and a hordika foot in the front.

-Arms
The arms have too how keep them moving well, with the same pieces used as the hordika heads connecting an arm (used in matoran of Karda Nui) to the main part of the arm, connected to the Inika body. The structure of the arm is close to the structure of the more simple titans (or warriors), and have too another imaginative use of armor, in this case, head of the barraki Takadox. The lower part of the arm is simple, only a Inika leg, but it keeps the playability and schale to the arms. The hands have additions, like a blade and claws (from some mistika sets) to make the fingers. The weapons are too simple, but good, a Midak Skyblaster (that really fires spheres)in one hand and in other, the Power Lance (that is very big and can rotate), with three air sabers as the blades, connected by three technic connector with axle hole in each blade to a piece and to the main axle supporting the upper part.

So, making two arms and two legs, connecting to the body with the head this set is complete. I don't described the complete parts of legs and arms, but they fits well as they have how keep strong connected to the body (due to legs' pneumatics and the other arms in the back of the main arms). The newest pieces in the set are the mask, the claws and the armor in the chest (If you don't have a Mistika set with claw or this armor, these will be new pieces).

-Playability
This buildable action figure is very playable. Sometimes the movements of the legs are a bit restrict due to the connections that it have in the body, but it isn't a serious problem, because it moves very well. The buildig makes it resistent, so adds a good point in the playability. And the Midak Skyblaster (that includes four spheres and really fires) is another good point. This new version of Takanuva is oone of the best Bionicle sets in terms of playability.  

-Availability
This set is available in some countries, but in some (like here in Brazil) are being released only in October. I got this by &#163;19.99 (before being released in toy stores from Brazil), that worth as US$ 29.99. And about comparison of prices, is a hard subject. This have more pieces (it have exactly 267 pieces) than the set 7681 (that have 206 pieces but have the same price). But as the set 7681 is a Star Wars set, it have a different type of playability, and as this set is a Bionicle set, this have the playability and fun of an action-figure. With this price you can choose what you like more, as example, if you don't like action figures, don't get one Bionicle only to put a bad rate on it or say that they are boring. If you consider Bionicle as boring, maybe you never played with one or don't know what is an action figure. This, as a big bionicle set, maybe change the thoughts about Bionicle, it shows a good playability and contents, they aren't only random figures. I recommend this to who would like to start with the Bionicle theme and to who likes action figures. This is also useful to Technic.   

Here are the basic pros and cons of the set:
- Pros:
Midak Skyblaster (what takes minutes of fun!)
Technic pieces (pneumatics systems and much more)
Good size (It is a good and a big size to an action figure)
Nice design (design is something that is very important to bionicle sets, and this deserves a 5/5 in design)

- Cons:
Too much white pieces, but anyways it is good to some MOCs (and of course, very good to white MOCs or upgrades). About the armor on the back, I'll not mark it as a con, I tried to put, but as this have Matoran arms in the back to keep the arms stronger, don't have a good way to put armors as in the front of the set but in the back.

- Overall:
As a very playable action figure, it is a 5/5, with the comparison that it deserves. So, as I said, it is recommended to who likes Bionicle, who would like to start to collect Bionicle sets and the pieces are also useful to Technic, but if you don't like action figures, so this isn't a good choice. Five out five for this awesome buildable action figure.

I like the mask.

I do not like the shoulder pads.

They are actually a face!

Could use more color.

Maybe shorter height.

It could possibly use a matoran of its own?

other wise, I think it is a good set!

"sodomy","2009-04-20T21:07:43.7Z","Good Looking Figure","Neat set, nicely designed. The colours are a bit sketchy, but it flows nicely enough. Very tall model, coming in a very large box. Price is a bit steep for the amount of pieces. Mask could be better.
In conclusion:

Pros
Tall but stable figure
Fun to pose
interesting use of pieces

Cons
Price
Mask
Blaster
Colour


Personally, I think I could have gone without this set. The pros don't seem to live up to the price for me. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-28T21:49:52.577Z","The Enlarged Toa of Light","This set is my favorite titan/warrior I own. I even think he is better than Toa Ignika and Toa Mata Nui now! It would have been even cooler to make a set depicting him after he was cured from the shadow leech, like they did with the Jetrax T6! 

He has the same dark metallic gray color as Maxilos, but I think it looks better with white. I really like the way the midak skyblaster is attached to his arm. The power lance looks a little small for him, but I do not care much. I also like the way they put Takadox heads as shoulder armor. He also has a very different torso design from any smaller titans/warriors that involves an Inika torso, liftarms, and a lower Vahki torso. This new way of using Av-Matoran limbs as supports his arms are interesting, but limits pose-ability. The legs have an amazing design, very unlike any smaller titan/warrior.

pros:
Recolored pieces.
Cool new Avohkii.
Amazing design!
Power Lance.
Midak Skyblaster.
Fun to pose.
Takadox heads.

cons:
NONE!

Takanuva is an awesome warrior! I highly recommend him to any Bionicle fan!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building Experience</strong>:&nbsp; For a bionicle, it is a great build.&nbsp; It took me 20-30 minutes.&nbsp; You build the torso first, then the highly detailed legs, then the arms.&nbsp; The build is quite easy, and very fun.</p>
<p>5/5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts: </strong>I'm not much of a MOCer myself, but with 200+ pieces you get a lot of parts.&nbsp; All the parts fit in well with the set.&nbsp; The staff is huge and good for parts.&nbsp; His shoulders have fancy gray heads from the Barraki.&nbsp; I like all the parts.</p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability: </strong>The playability is very good.&nbsp; Because of the size, the articulation isn't perfect.&nbsp; But his arms move great and it is easy to play with him.&nbsp; The midak skyblasters shoot very far, but the only problem is when they land they continue to roll, so they're easy to lose (im missing 1).&nbsp; Great playability.</p>
<p>5/5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Value for Money:</strong> For what you get, its definately worth $30.&nbsp; Takanuva is huge, so, the price is totally worth it.&nbsp; Takanuva is one of my favorite if not my favorite character in the bionicle story, so i like the price.</p>
<p>5/5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall: </strong>A fantastic set.&nbsp; If you can find it in a store today, pick it up.&nbsp; But i have seen great deals on ebay for this guy so get him.&nbsp; Hes awesomo.</p>

His gun isn't like any of the other guns ever used before. It holds four bullets and comes with four bullets. He looks epic. The only problem is, you can only get him off ebay or amazon now days. I got mine for twenty bucks. Totally worth it.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"Lucem","2011-07-06T19:17:55.97Z","Takanuva on a Whole New Level!","This is my review of Phantoka/Mistika Takanuva. So, first we're gonna look at the colors. I don't really like them. Instead of the classic gold and white, we have a ""Shadow Infection"" look, so they replaced the gold with gunmetal. Next, we have size. This guy is one of the biggest Bionicles EVER! He's about a foot (maybe even longer) long! He could probably kill Teridax in one hit! Next, it's weapons. He has the standard Phantoka blaster. He also has a ""Power Lance"", which has a spinning feature. Personally, I think this was an afterthought to give Takanuva more gimmicks. I feel that the Power Lance is short for my taste, but that can be fixed with some connectors and rods. His mask is a nice update from the original mask. He of course wears the Avohkii, the Great Mask of Light. But if you read colors, you'll find out that his mask is gunmetal instead of gold.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>-Huge!<br><br>-articulation<br><br>- weapons<br><br>-detail<br><br>Cons:<br><br>- gunmetal instead of gold<br><br>- short Power Lance<br><br>-More/better weapons?<br><br>&nbsp;<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Nmfrey23","2021-12-27T21:09:57.327Z","Takanuva hit the gym after 2003","<p>Of the three existing Takanuva sets, this is my favorite. While I think the 2003 set is great and the 2010 set holds a special place in my heart (one of my first LEGO sets), this set was the most fun to build. Along with seeing the return of a fan-favorite character, this set is very complex, features many new parts, and was one of the tallest characters as of 2008.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Complexity: Many Bionicle sets can be finished in 10-30 minutes. You&#39;ll want to set aside 1+ hours for this one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Parts: Plenty of new parts, and old ones in new colors. The new mask of light looks good, and looks similar to the 2003 version.</p>

<p>Posing: This set could move a lot more than I expected. The ankles, hips, neck and shoulders all have extra ball joints to make this possible.</p>

<p>Weapons: Armed with a massive trident and a wrist mounted cannon. The cannon holds 4 shots.</p>

<p>Size: This is a large set that looks well-made when finished. It isn&#39;t a large set just for the sake of it.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Red &amp; Blue pins: The set is mostly white and metallic grey, but it has a lot of red and blue axles. Some may think that it makes the set look worse.</p>

<p>Back: The back of the set is flat, and looks unfinished compared to the rest of the set</p>

<p>Shoulders: The set has two pieces resembling shoulder blades. These can sometimes shift around on the back of the set&nbsp;and become stuck</p>

<p>Mask: While it looks awesome, it&#39;s also huge and may limit head movement</p>

<p>Joints: Joints are very brittle (applies to all &#39;08-&#39;10 sets)</p>

<p>Overall, this set is a behemoth that boasts one of the most unique builds I&#39;ve seen in a Bionicle set. If you&#39;re looking for a larger set that doesn&#39;t have the same wallet-destroying price tag as Brutaka or Roodaka in 2021, check out &#39;08 Takanuva.</p>
