"legoville410","2008-05-24T16:57:32.357Z","Alpha team w/ guns and new gadgets","Ok so i bought this set so i could have a lego jet for my military.
Turns out the changed the guns from starwars guns to fire nozzles attached to technic pieces. RIP OFF! The jet however looked at first like an F-22a Raptor BUT the wings are reverse. Other than that it is pretty realistic with exhaust ports and two, yes two, firing cannons. I am definetly getting more.

THE JEEP:
I did not even bother with it because it was SO Stupid.
I will let you find out for yourself.

"Loganwan","2008-06-23T22:28:33.327Z","A jet, a truck, gold, henchmen, and a fighter pilot","This is a pretty good set. Starting with the jet:

I like the design of the jet, designed after the Raptor.  The design is good, with the nice Agents color scheme.  Having two firing cannons on board, really makes the jet a powerhouse.  The only problem with the jet is a lack of landing gear.  This is a playability problem, but the jet looks good without them.

Truck:

The truck is VERY tall.  It kind of looks silly with the smaller tires.  It is necessary for the really well designed suspension.  It utilizes rubber pieces to allow motion of the truck body.  There is a hidden gun under the hood, and a chair in the back of the truck for the henchmen to sit with his two giant guns.
The trailer is very tall too, and looks even more silly.  There is a countdown timer on the trailer that can be hit with the jet's missle to blow the gold off of the trailer.

Overall a good set with only a few design flaws.  Three minifigs, two vehicles, and lots of playability.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-08-20T15:58:03.233Z","10 golden rares ","<p>A great ship with dual launching missiles.&nbsp;The truck is good as well, but its quite difficult to put a figure in the driver&#39;s seat. The best part of this set are the ten little golden bricks. In fact, if not for them and the other golden elements (the henchman&#39;s&nbsp;gun and hairpiece), I wouldn&#39;t have even bought this. The henchman&#39;s guns are really a downgrade compared to brickarms, but they&#39;ll have to do.</p>

PROS

awesome jet

figs

gold gun

gold bars

chrome coloured pieces 

jeep has suspension

working launchers under the wings of the jet.

gold goes flying when you hit the target.

CONS

jeep looks weird and is too high

cold bars are just spray painted and the paint rubs off.

stickers

overall ignore the cons and get the set just for the plane. its worth it!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-26T23:20:13.14Z","&quot;I love gold. Its colour, its brilliance, its divine heaviness.&quot;","This set was my very first Agents set and it automatically endeared me to the theme. (I got Swamp Raid the next day!) This set comes with three minifigs, a jet, a truck, and GOLD! HEE, HEE, SWEET, SWEET GOLD! (read in grizzled miner voice) The jet is a very neat design and a creative use of pieces (i.e. the grey barrel piece as a thruster). The jet is piloted by Agent Fuse, who has a double-sided face! YAY!:D There is also one missile launcher under each wing. The jet earns a 5/5.
The truck is a little more disapponting. Oh sure, it has some good points including the shovel and walkie-talkie on the outside, the trailer, the backseat for the henchman, the little target that can send the gold flying when hit, and the overall design, but there are two GLARING flaws. A) The suspension on the truck is useless and doesn't work. B) The truck is WAY too high off the ground for the figs to reach, but the tires aren't big enough for it to be classified as a monster truck.

Pros:
three figs: Gold Tooth, Fuse, henchman
Gold Tooth reminds me of Goldfinger, my fav Bond villain!
jet is VERY cool
GOLD!

Cons:
suspension on truck doesn't work
truck is too high off ground",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Anyway with the reveiw!
pros:
Cool Jet design
Cool missile launchers 
The Trucks Catapult
Just the awsomeness of it!

Cons:
Nose cone falls of easily
Not much else",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-28T17:31:10.153Z","great agents set!","i will review the jet and then the truck

jet: well it's bigger then i thought it would be. I don't exactly like how the wings look flat, but there isn't many ways to improve that. The cockpit is brilliant and it is a sleek jet.

Truck: pretty tall and it comes with gold and two minigifures. The tires suspend it a little higher then i would like, but it doesn't effect the ""evil"" looks the truck has. Goldtooth looks a little silly :)

"captain_radda_radda","2009-06-17T15:13:15.06Z","The military should use this jet design","Seriously, if real jets looked like this, they would be swooshing across the battle field in no time. Well lets get down to it. I'd like to start off by saying that in these versus mode sets, one vehicle is usually better and bigger than the other. Not in this one. Lego really focussed on equallity this time. The jet alone looks like a $20 dollar set. The truck is amazing. It can fit a total of three people with a gunner seat in the back. The trucks suspension feature doesnt make the truck rock back and forth like the 4-wheeled pursuit vehicle. 

Pros:
The jet is very large
The characters
The henchmen and his crazy machine guns
The size of the vehicles
There are stickers, but not that many

Cons:
The infernoe logo in the front is divided, making it look too wide
The jet has chrome and grey pieces. Choose one, but not both

Overall:
An excellent set that was worth the low cost of thirty dollars. Get it while you can and before Agents 2.0 phases them out. Oh, and it goes great with Swamp Raid. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:

1. Plane has great design.
2. Truck has great design.
3. Comes with an extra henchmen.
4. Plane has missles.

Cons:

1. Gold tooth's gun is just a black gun painted gold and the paint chips.

pros -

translucent pieces
spring loaded cannons

cons -
target doesn't flip
fiddly

"james3426","2009-10-25T18:15:30.217Z","Nice Idea of a Chase","This set in my opinion is even better than the turbo car chase. It is fun to act like Gold Tooth and his companion are stealing gold, then Fuse swoops in and shoots at the target to make the gold fly off. The jet is my favorite part of the set because of the silver pieces, awesome detail and two missile launchers. The truck is also cool and has a swivel chair, hidden missiles, and a trailer with gold.

pros:
jet is very detailed.
includes two missile launchers.
silver and gold pieces.
fun action feature.
Gold Tooth is truly gold!

cons:
none.

In all, a great set to play around with. I recommend this to any lego fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"NickBrick","2011-01-30T18:25:27.99Z","Fun, Imaginative, And a surprisingly good build!","<br>JET: Wow. This is truly the best plane made out bricks you are ever going to see. Its main frame is Grey with blue wings. Along with some yellow stripes. The jet is boosted by one rocket in the back. Its a BARREL! element, Ha! Stickers? Its got stickers all right. I think it has about eight. Now comes my favorite part, the cockpit. Its big and has one of the most realistic&nbsp; jet windows ever.<br>. It has a single lever to steer. In the back of the cockpit is a storage area to put a gun or a radio or maybe a bomb.( None are included in the set) Overall: 4.7 Great!<br>ARMORED TRUCK: A little on the corny side but good none the less.&nbsp; Gold tooth is the driver<br>and a Hench man sits in the back.( Waving twin machine guns, awesome!) The trailer has tons of beautiful gold bars. The Truck, well is not quite as good. It looks a bit chunky.<br>However it did have two features that were a nice surprise. One is that it had some flip-up<br>lasers under the hood. And two it had a&nbsp; second set for another Hench man such as Break jaw or Saw fist. Overall: 3.9<br>Set overall:4.6 A great addition to anybody's Agents collection. Hope my review was helpful.<br>",TRUE,4,4,5,3,4
