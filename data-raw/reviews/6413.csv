To begin, you have the great minifig selection - points of note are Claw-dette (!) with a pretty cool head, Agent Fuse with new guy hair in Orange, Agent Trace with the Lara Croft style hair and female agent suit and Dr. Inferno's wacky hair (although it is the gummy exoforce hair plastic). I love the style of the suits in general, like Incredibles or any stereotypical hero/villans - nicely overdone!

The play value is great with the arrangement of the set. From the beginning it is fun even building the flame pit and crane to dangle the captured agent over (while cackling maniacally of course). Nice dark brown slopes here.

The little car across to the pit is also nicely done. Some may hate stickers, but the little Inferno logos on the chairs is a nice touch - looks quite stylish!

Moving on to the central area, Dr. Inferno has an austere but cleverly crafted chair to perch on, waiting to &quot;welcome&quot; visitors through the main doors :) It uses a space cockpit window in white as the chair back. The central area is supported with large girder bricks, which are great for all kinds of buildings. Stickers again, but the two computer screens for Dr. Inferno to watch look the business, although he will indubitably get a fearsome crick in his neck (they are mounted high and quite close to his &quot;throne&quot;).

What can I say, the doors are simply superb. The plates used for the &quot;teeth&quot; look amazing in the metallic silver colour. Certainly tricky to apply, the huge stickers for the door panels do look superb one in place. The barbed wire pieces above the door are a bit lame in my opinion - being the same squishy plastic as the new Castle flails. Certainly having just two of them is not so useful.

Above the door we come to the volcano face. The sheer amount of transparent orange slopes, dark brown slopes (45 degree and tall 60 degree ones) is astounding. I am a fan of BURPs in general and it is great to have some in brown. The finished look of the volcano face is very convincing, and the colour combination matches perfectly.

The giant Laser turret is just hilarious. It angles around very well when completed, although doesn't exactly hide when angled low. Instead it sits looking rather ridiculously half-hidden behind the rock peaks. I think this is not altogether a problem though, as the entire concept is not really that serious! The Lime green parts set off the construction nicely, as do the lightsaber power rod things. Copious amounts of trans-neon yellow/green little dishes too, including on two stereotypical power pylon constructions hidden behind the mountain peaks.

Anothe rock face on the right hand side (from the front). Nothing much inside but a gas cylinder, and the outside is quite straightforward too (a slow enough construction with many parts again though!) More BURPs including two smaller ones in two-tone trans orange and dark grey (pretty awesome) like in Skeleton Tower. The giant display panel is rather silly looking, but fits with the general mayhem of the crazy base! Another whopping huge sticker for it!

The final rock face on the left hand side has a nice little computer console bank tucked away in the interior, and a handy little platform for the buggy to depart from for the fire pit.

The flying Agent chopper thingy is nifty enough looking. Not much special about it although I like the feature of the net dropping out when you push the pin on top.

All in all, this base gets a huge thumbs up from me. There is so much going on, so many great parts, great minifigs, intricate enough construction, that it is hard to fault anything for the â‚¬70 price point. You could add to the interior, but really considering what else is in the set, I'm quite happy with it. If you buy any Lego Agents sets - get this one. It's superb value compared to many other sets (compare for example to Peril in Peru?)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Some neat features are the minifigs (particularly Dr. Inferno and Claw-dette), the fiendish lava pit torture, the hoverjet (would've worked as a set by itself, plus villain), and the over-the-top laser. (Or &quot;laser&quot; as Dr. Evil would put it.) The volcano itself is large and intimidating and I really like the doors as they somewhat resemble jaws and the barbed wire looks like eyes so the volcano has an artificial &quot;face&quot;. The bit inside the dorors is a little bare and could've included an evil catwalk with computer nodes and extra guards or motion-detecting chain guns, but I digress. The portion of the volcano on the left kind of makes up for that. (A word to the wise, this goes GREAT with the Turbocar Chase!)

"captain_radda_radda","2009-06-15T16:33:16.653Z","Wow, just wow","I was lucky enough to find this set, so I got it. This set is simply fantastic. It has so much detail and retains the natural volcanoe look. Dr. Infernoe looks just as pshycho as ever, and clawdette has a claw(wow, thats cool). Fire arm looks like a terminator and has a flamethrower/bazooka arm. The agents are nothing fantastic, but will do. In my opinion, the sets biggest flaw is the jetcopter. It is big, but it looks way to blocky. The stupid net doesn't even fire! Oh well, its no big deal. The base has details and looks great with Dr. Infernoes army behind it. It folds up pretty easily and the laser cannon is truly outstanding. 

Pros:
Big 
great money value
Minifigures are great
authantic look

Cons:
Agent Jet
Dr. Infernoes chair gets in the way of the door

Overall:
If you have the money and you can find it, BUY it. It is a must have",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The big laser cannon on top is awsome! I like how the net drops on the agents copter. Overall, I think this is a really good set!",FALSE,5,4,4,5,4
