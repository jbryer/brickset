**FIGS**
Agent Chase: Love the black Mutt hair and double sided face. Uniform is OK, but only because every agent but Trace has the same one. SCORE: 4/5
Saw Fust: My favorite part of the set. I love the face and the new arm that can hold lightsabre blades and bars like that. SCORE: 5/5

**CHASE'S JET PACK**
Don't really like the rotor, but it goes well with everything. The hook catching the jewel works well. It seems a little small and cramped, and Chase sometimes falls off. SCORE: 3/5

**SAW FIST'S SNOWMOBILE**
Really good. Tread works well and the bionicle skates look cool. The only bad things are the fact that the laser can't go down all the way and the jewel falls off WAY too easily. SCORE: 4/5

Overall this set is good and has very good playability. AGENTS RULE!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-06-03T16:56:57.28Z","An ok for the price and pieces","This is a small set from the agents theme. It was recently released, and is maybe the theme to replace Exo force. At the first view, all the agents sets looks like so much similar in the design, and more in the color scheme, the agents have a blue uniform with some gray, yellow and few black details. Well detailed but it isn't much good, due to the details be a bit confuse. The &quot;cyborg Saw Fist&quot; (or how these half robot half man are called), is also like the other from the same theme, have a orange and black &quot;uniform&quot;, and vehicles, so repetitive, but the details and color scheme at all are good.

The faces of the minifigures are also good, altough the &quot;cyborg's&quot; face isn't like some other Lego faces (a quite detailed, with robotic systems and a red bionic eye), it still good. Also, each minifigure included have a different hair piece, and the cyborg don't have a hand, it was replaced by a buzzsaw, good to a weapon, and also to use on a minifigure as arm, but not really that good.

The agent's vehicle is a &quot;jetpack&quot;, made by some useful pieces with different shapes of bricks, and also two hoses on each side, combined with two small weapons to the minifigure hang on it and at the same time to fot the legs in the pieces of the back. The minifigure don't stay fitted very well, but it still payable and don't dismantle easily. The jetpack have the same color scheme of the minifigure's &quot;uniform&quot;, it is repetitive, but some differences, like the gray color scheme on the back of the jetpack, makes it good. Some useful pieces are used in the building, like two semi triangular plates, putted on each side, to make &quot;wings&quot;, and makes it more aerodinamic. A notable feature is the propeller above all the jetpack building. It is useful to really much creations, like planes, but no much neccessary to a jetpack, altough there is no problem with this set, just to it. Maybe it was only putted on the jetpack to increase, not to looks like reallistic. Overall, this jetpack isn't the best thing to make a minifigure &quot;fly&quot;, but it don't have much problems, is just simple, but is good.

The snow mobile vehicle of the cyborg is well made, and use useful pieces in a good building. The base of the vehicle are two long bricks on each side, and one is increased by some other pieces, to make it &quot;moves&quot;, looks like a few more reallistic. The front is well made, too, featuring the common colors of the &quot;cyborgs&quot;, and the pieces have a good shape and are in a good position to make it cool. A stick is connected in the left side (looking for the front) of the vehicle, and it have an orange piece on the top, to looks like a weapon. Useful, altough no much neccessary. Another different pieces to increase the vehicle, not neccessary too, but good, are the two blades of Kopaka Nuva (from 2002). A bit odd, but good to looks like more bionic, or just realistic to a snow mobile vehicle. But these blades have a big size in comparison to some other pieces included. The set also have a red diamond piece, useful, just to increase it. This vehicle is overall cool, but the building features some unnecessary pieces.

Overall, this set is cool to play, but the building could be better in somethings, like in the blades, or in the jetpack. And also, the color schemes are so much repetitive, to minifigs and vehicles, it isn't awesome at all, it still good. A 4,3 of 5 for the building, design, pieces and price. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:

Agent Chase mini fig- reversible head(sunglasses, no sunglasses), overall: pretty cool

Saw Fist mini fig- cool robotic arm holds his saw, overall: Super cool

Jet Pack- this doesn't look like much on the box, and it's not the first thing you'd think of when you hear the word jet pack, but it's actually very cool. Chase has a piece on his body that plugs right into the pack, so he won't fall out. when attached to the pack, he can grab on to 2 cool guns that are attached to the jet pack itself. There is a neat propeller on the top, a little hook on the bottom that is used to grab on to the little gem that's encased in the jar on Fist's vehicle, and the hook can fold up for landings. This jet pack is small, sturdy, has great playability, and overall:
super cool!

Snowmobile- has a seat for Saw Fist, a movable cannon on the side, a tread to allow it to move, a ski on either side, 2 little gun like things on the front, and a spot to hold the encased jewel on the back. This is really sturdy, looks cool, has wonderful playability, and overall: I love it!

"_whateverist","2008-12-02T05:04:09.747Z","Nice parts, but not enough substance","I suppose you can't expect much content when you buy a â‚¬10 set - at that pricepoint, you'd be lucky to have one minifig and one vehicle. Two vehicles is certainly ambitious, and while this set has quite a few highlights, overall it feels like the sort of thing you throw together with whatever parts are left over from a bigger set.

The snowmobile is the highlight of the set. Despite its flimsy look it is surprisingly solid, and the only part you'll be hunting for after it falls off for the umpteenth time is the (actually rather neat) crystal container. The single track works surprisingly well and the vehicle looks quite menacing, mainly thanks to the vicious-looking blades - just the look for the villain's transport, then.

The helicopter-jetpack-thing doesn't work at all. It is a bulky, uninspired mess of parts that only really looks good from the front. 

The minifigs do a lot to save the set. The Agent's double-face gimmick is clever, I suppose, but he didn't really need it - either face works well. The villain, though, that's where the set shines. With his Terminator-like robotic face and chainsaw arm (!) he certainly look the part.

This is not a bad set to get as a gift and you can have fun with it. But on the whole, I'd rather Lego spent a bit more parts and effort on making the Agent's vehicle more interesting, even if it meant upping the price - or just forget about it altogether and make the snowmobile truly shine. As it is this set has one very good minifig, one brilliant minifig, a decent vehicle and one poor one. Worth the price? Just about, I'd say. Just.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Captain","2008-09-09T19:44:21.857Z","Lego Cyborgs? Yes please.","Awesome. I've had a recent obsession with cyborgs, and just in time, guess what? They're in lego form now, with the agents theme. But more on that later, on to the set.

The jetpack: A neat little build, with some good parts like the hoses and stuff. There is one problem, the minifig backpack piece that attaches the agent to his pack does not clip in fully because it is blocked by 2 bricks. It's less than a millimeter away from popping in, but it doesn't, so the agent will sometimes pop off.

The snowmobile: This vehicle is interesting, but I didn't really like it until I modified it to be symmetrical. It has some nice parts, like a little glass dome with the crystal inside, and the tread.

The Minifigures:

Saw Fist is most definitely the highlight of this set. I love cyborgs, and the coolest (although most stereotypical) one is in the cheapest set. Score! He has an awesome face, half metal with a mechanical green eye. He also has a robotic arm with a chainsaw in place of a hand, hence his name.

Agent Chase: He has a cool suit similar to earlier alpha team torsos, but other than that he's pretty basic and unexciting. Still cool, though, I used him to make a sweet commando.

Overall: This set is great, I actually liked it so much I bought a second one. That way, I have a set of tracks instead of a single one, two propellers, two awesome cyborgs, two agents (which are now commando guys), and 4 hoses. Anyway, the set comes with a lot of great stuff and it's totally worth it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The heli-pack (you just can't call it a jetpack in my opinion) was smaller than I expected, but the snowmobile balances that out because it was bigger than I expected. Saw Fist gives off the air of a run-of-the-mill Bond henchmen. (Not that I'm complaining, I love Bond!) At $12.99 CAN, the price is good for 88 pieces. You can get Batman's buggy for the same price, and it has 12 less pieces.

Minifigs: Saw Fist is cool looking guy. He&#180;s got a neat mech hand. You can put some bricks on it. Face is a little ugly. And he has an Inferno sign on his back. That&#180;s about it (for him):P

Agent Chase is cool too. He has a nice uniform detail. Also he has some details on his pants :P

"knuclear200x","2009-04-25T00:12:08.31Z","More like ""Helicopter-pack Pursuit""","I'll start with the vee-hickles. 

Saw Fist's snow mobile looks nice. The blades appear to be Bionicle swords, or at least you can use 'em for that purpose. And there's a place to set that gem case. It doesn't actually hold it, it's loose so that you can do that thing where Agent Chase's jet- i mean, HELICOPTER-pack's hook can swipe it by the handle with ease. The mobile also runs on a single tread wheel, with two hose-nozzle guns in the front and has this awesome sonic blaster on the right side you can put up or down. The turbine gets in the way though so you can't put it ALL the way down.

As for Agent Chase's Jetpack, It doesn't even have any jets to speak of, unless it's referring to the jet-wings it happens to have. It seems the only thing that elevates it is the propellor. It's connected to a hinge as well, so that it'll correspond to the direction your pretending it to fly. The HELICOPTER-pack's hook is on the bottom so that it can pick up the gem case, mentioned earlier. It is also connected to the bendable cords connected with the hose-nozzles, which are probably the flame-throwers. 

I must say that for agent equipment, you think they'd come up with a more advanced and less dorky item than a propellor. Plus it's bulky and looks very heavy (mini-fig-wise), and it'll make you wonder how much energy it consumes and how it would perform in the field of battle against the snow-mobile. What IS nice about it though, is that it comes with a very useful piece that the mini-fig can wear between the head and body, and can be tightly connected to the pack without having you worry about it falling off.

The mini-figs are nice. Not much to say about the cool-looking Agent Chase. He's just a double-faced-sunglasses-or-not figure with the same generic features, while Saw Fist has this one thing that makes him more playable than the other. Saw Fist's right hand was replaced by a hollow lego peg with which you can put in a saw. But it doesn't end there. Saw Fist can also be ""Pick Fist"", ""Shovel Fist"", ""Hose Fist"", ""Hose Nozzle Fist"", ""Lightsaber Fist"", ""Nose-cone Fist"", ""1x1 block Fist"", ""8x6 Plate Fist""...ah the possibilities are almost endless.

Overall, what we have here is worth 10 bucks (but I got it at Target for $9). The Snow mobile is the best looking of the two, while the HELICOPTER pack is just something you'd rather improve. And Saw Fist, you'll love that guy. He can be any Fist you happen have in your bucket of spare parts.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"David1971","2008-12-12T11:31:11.09Z","Better than expected","I thought there wasn't really much to this set, but it turned out to be better than expected. 

It has to be said, though, that both the good Agents and evil Dr Inferno would do better in their respective jobs if they had some more helpful designers. Silly Saw Fist has gone to a lot of trouble to steal the energy crystal but is pulling it along in an eminently snatchable display cabinet. Meanwhile Agent Chase is using a jetpack the size of a wardrobe.

But it's all good really. The tread on the snowmobile moves in a very satisfying way and has a good grip of the ground -- it feels very well designed and made. The propeller thing is good for those of us who like to add wind turbines to our Lego worlds, and the set comes with stickers but thankfully looks fine without them.

Overall the Agents theme is seems slightly silly - even 10 year olds might find it a bit childish, compared to the more cool and sophisticated view of spies or government agents that they will have seen in movies - but this is a decent &#163;7.99 (UK) set with nice touches.

My favorite part about the set is most certainly the Henchmen's Vehicle! It can run on any surface, it has a moveable sky turret, two front built on blasters, an easy to fall off crystal holder, and slightly easy to move blade too!
Chase's Jetpack is pretty good as well, I really love the way you CAN actually take the crystal holder off the back with the Jetpack's hook. It also has a spinning propeller, and if that's not enough, chase can fly comfortably while holding to blasters in his hands! It really is amazing!

Pieces/Stickers

This set contains 7 stickers!  WAY too many!  The yellow ""A's"" on each of the jetpack's wings should be printed on, same with the propeller blades!  Apart from that, there are some cool Bionicle Vahki pieces on Sawfist's sled.(They're used as blades on the front.)  This set is the only one that contains Sawfist's head, which is a major plus for me.  His robot arm is pretty dang awesome as well, since you can fit a few things in it.  Agent Chase is pretty good, his head is double faced: One with glasses and com, and the other is determined without glasses.  The jetpack's playability is OK, since all you can do is spin the propellers.  Not much else to say...  Now the sled of evilness!  It's pretty cool, with only 1 small tread as propulsion, and a removable jewel case!  The agent-takes-jewel-away function works pretty well, and that's the plot of this set.

"z","2010-03-05T21:57:01.5Z","8631 Jetpack Pursuit","<p>Well this is probably the coolest Agents set I own.&nbsp; I bought it along with two other sets&nbsp;of different themes&nbsp;at&nbsp;the Lego store in Downtown Disney.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Box</b>:&nbsp; The box contains a comic giving the story behind the set, like the other sets in the theme.&nbsp; The box is more of a square in shape.&nbsp; This is a little odd, since most sets of this size have boxes that are more rectangular.</p>
<p><b>Instructions:&nbsp; </b>Like other semi-recent sets, the build is made easy by very clear-cut directions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MInifigs:</b>&nbsp; The minifigs included are&nbsp;the hero&nbsp;Chase, and evil cyborg Sawfist.&nbsp; Chase is a little more unique with a double-sided head; one side showing a frown, the other a pair of shades a slight smile.&nbsp; Sawfist also is a superior fig.&nbsp; His head is half robotic, half criminal.&nbsp; He sports a robotic arm with a saw, hence the name.&nbsp; His torso is also a little more interesting, being metallic on side of the saw-arm.&nbsp; This gives a cool outlook on the surgery that was performed to equip this criminal with a permanent weapon.&nbsp; The accessories included are two different hair-pieces, and a saw for the villian.</p>
<p><b>The Vehicles:</b>&nbsp; First the main part of the set:&nbsp; The snowmobile.&nbsp; The snowmobile is actually quite large, being about 5 in. long.&nbsp; It is armed with two guns on the front and one large futuristic cannon.&nbsp; The jewel that Sawfist stole is perched on the back.&nbsp; It seems weird that the jewel is so far away from Sawfist.&nbsp; You would think that he would want it close by, so as to make sure that it stays safe.&nbsp; The snowmobile skies are made up of Bionicle blades.&nbsp; These were new to me, because I never collected many Bionicles.&nbsp; Now the secondary part:&nbsp; The jetpack.&nbsp; The jetpack, (as many have stated,) is not a jetpack.&nbsp; It is more of a chunk with a propellar sticking out the top.&nbsp; A hook is sticking out the bottom, so as to snatch the jewel case away from the villian.&nbsp; It is not bad, but it is not a jetpack.</p>
<p>Overall, it is a very good set.&nbsp; Sadly, there are not many like it these days.&nbsp; The only poor things about it are the fact that there are stickers, and that the jewel case falls off a little too easily.&nbsp; I would say get this one before you get 8967, as this is much better.&nbsp;</p>

"BuilderBrothers","2010-10-30T16:49:08.5Z","Agent vs. Henchman","Not the best of the Lego&nbsp;Agent sets I have ever seen, this set includes both Agent Chase and Saw Fist.&nbsp; Both of the minifigures are quite unique, and are one of the best parts of the set.&nbsp; Both of the vehicles did not really impress me, but they are good for the set in&nbsp;Agent&nbsp;vs. Henchman Set.&nbsp; If you want a cheep $10 Agent set, however, this is a pretty good choice.",FALSE,4,4,3,3,4
"woodall_aidan","2010-08-06T22:35:39.623Z","Good Starting Agents Set!","This set is&nbsp; okay, but it's not the greatest set I've gotten. Jewel case easily falls off though. Both figures are unique, which is nice. Saw Fist only comes in this set. Same with Agent Chase with a double-sided head and neck bracket. Also, not many Agents sets have been released to start with. And on the sled-bike thing, it should have had two treads instead of one. That's because when trying to model it, it sometimes falls over. I'd have to give it a 4/5.<br>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,3
