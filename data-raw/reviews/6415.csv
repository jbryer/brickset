I might as well have gotten this for the minifigs and the motorcycle. The only pros I can think of are the detailed minifigs, the remote-controlled alligators,(which are hysterical) the motorcycle, and the booby trapped bridge.

Pros: An awesome drop bridge. One of my favorite features!
      Flick Fire missles! My first set that has them. They work well!
      2 crocodiles and minifigures.
     One of the coolest motorcycles ever! Another vehicle for the agents

Cons: A bit unstable (especially when picked up)

"Gus_263","2008-08-08T19:35:20.827Z","Mission 2: Swamp Raid","8632 SWAMP RAID:

This set is almost new (at least was released this year) and is a part of the agents theme. It costs around US$19.99. As a new set, it still available for purchase.
The agents theme features different color schemes for each &quot;faction&quot; (the agents and the &quot;cyborgs&quot;, also called as &quot;the henchmen of Doctor Inferno&quot;, and Dr. inferno is the enemy of the agents, and his minifigure can be found in the sets 8635 and 8637). The agents features in their vehicles and also in the minifigs, some silver and blue colors, with sometimes few green details. The henchmen features the basic orange and black colors, with sometimes white details, like in the minifigure of Dr. Inferno.
This set have two minifigures, the guy called &quot;Breakjaw&quot; (the henchman) and the guy called &quot;Agent Charge&quot; (the agent). Both minifigures are well detailed and really different. The Charge's minifigure have the same details of the other agents (except the details of agent Trace), making it original and a bit repetitive. Also, Breakjaw have the same details of the other henchmen's minifigures. I personally don't dislike the minifigures, but I like more classic minifigures, without so much details.
About details, Charge have a hair like the Dash's hair in the Alpha Team (Dash is a character from the Alpha team storyline. Agents and Alpha team have similarities, but no much in color scheme and details). And Breakjaw have a piece like a helmet, but with a hole to the face appears, and a &quot;jaw&quot; under it. It is a bit odd, but still a bit cool, too.

The color scheme consists in the main colors of the theme, blue and silver for the agents, black and orange for the cyborgs, though this set have more colors, of course. 
An interesting form of building in the set is the motorcycle. It have below the base some technic pieces, and also at the sides. These pieces connects the wheels to the chassis. The wheels are big, very cool to use in cars. Also in motorcycles, but I likes more the small motorcycles, where the minifigures stay at a good size.
Above these technic pieces (I say technic, but are used in much themes, but technic have more of these pieces, alongside some Bionicle sets), there are cilindrick 1X1 bricks with gray and blue colors. At the back, these pieces connects a &quot;fire&quot; piece, and at the front, these pieces connects pieces that makes it looks like to have missiles, but these missiles cannot be launched. The space for put the minifigure is good, but the motorcycle is very big at the point to looks like unrealistic, but is very playable. 

The chassis have some pieces increasing its front and back, pieces that are used in several Tiny turbos cars, and in much sets from the current racers theme. The pieces are useful but sometimes affects the design to make it looks like odd.
The space to put the minifigure is a space of 4X2 studs, and the minifigure (agent Charge) seat in it. It is very odd to a motorcycle, but the design isn't really awful, it is just strange. The back of the motorcycle have some flashlights connected by a 1X4 piece. The color scheme of each piece that makes the flashlights are a shiny red and orange. Very good to the design, I think. At the front, the flashlights are transparent, a good color, too, but the flashlights of the front are small in comparison with the flashlights from the back.
The Motorcycle isn't that bad as some says, but I agree that it could be better if small. But new ideas are welcome to the designers. I think it have a good design, but the size don't helps very much the design, making it not really good or bad, but average. Some itens included with the motorcycle and with the agent Charge minifigure are the &quot;silver&quot; (can be identified as gray) helmet, the map and a little gun. The itens are really useful.

Now, the review about the tower of Breakjaw, and the bridge. The tower's base is large, have at least five plates with different colors and size supporting. It is well supported, but is sometimes a bit hard to be transported intact, only if you have security. I think it should have more swamp scenery, it have six plant pieces (two are big and black, two are medium and green and one is small and green), could have a bit more. Some black and gray bricks supports the bridge, when a technic stick makes the system to the trap (it is called as &quot;booby-trapped-bridge&quot; in its description at S@H). 
It moves well, isn't fixed, and have some gray plates above, occupying a space of aprox. 17X6 studs. In the entrance of the bridge, the ramp is made by some plates, too, and sometimes it dismantle, but not so easily. At the sides of the bridge, there are some grind pieces. And at the end of the bridge, there are some bricks (and some other different pieces) making a weapon, with &quot;flick missiles&quot;. But these flick missiles are more resistent than the 2007's ones. Also, the weapon can rotates, making it more useful and playable.

The tower is very simple, it have four pieces in shape of pilars supporting it, and the part above is very small. It have some few increasements, like a wall at the left side, a flashlight at the top, and some other pieces. The Breakjaw minifigure can seat at a little piece, probably useda as a chair, and this tower is connected at the bridge by a piece in the shape of some stairs. It is very basic, and not much playable, but it have a good design, though could be better with more bricks increasing it a bit more. And it also have a small dock to put itens.

The Breakjaw's jetski is very basic and it is also poor builted. It uses a piece as the base, and it have few increasements, justa a small propeller at the back, some small orange pieces and two &quot;weapons&quot; (that cannot launch anything) at the sides. It have a space for one minifigure, due to it's size. It could be better with a big plate as base, but using a triangular shaped plate at the front, to be good in design at least. 
This set also includes two crocodiles (called as &quot;remote control crocodiles&quot; due to the pieces fixed at their backs), that are really cool, just like the old crocodiles from the adventurers sets, but with only few pieces at the back. 
Well, this set don't have any shark, the set that have sharks is the 8633 (Mission 4: Speedboat rescue), this have crocodiles, don't confuse this with 8633. And I understand that the old sharks were better in terms of design than the sharks from 8633, but it don't matter, if isn't about this set.

So, here are my pros and cons about this set:

Pros:
Good minifigs (altough could be more simple in details)
Good color schemes 
Useful pieces
Missiles works well 

Cons:
Much simple in building
Sometimes dismantle
Playability could be a bit better in some points, but in other like the missiles and motorcycle, the playability is good. 

The motorcycle isn't bad, but isn't good also, it is different from the common small ones. I personally thinks that the small motorcycles common among the city theme were better than this. But if you dislike the motorcycle and you have the set, I reccomend to use the pieces in another building.

Overall, it isn't a bad set at all but need much improvements, like in the tower and jetski. The motorcycle, as I said, isn't that bad, but smaller than this are better.
The playability is decent, color scheme good and pieces are useful. It is basically a 4/5. Not that bad, but you could expect more about this set. I don't know if US$19.99 is a good price to you buy this set, but I think it is a decent price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros: 
Agent Charge Mini fig
Break Jaw mini fig.
2 Remote controlled crocodiles- can move their mouths and tails, and they have little remote control pieces on their backs.
Motorcycle- fits one mini fig. big, sturdy, fun to play with, but it looks a little awkward(but that doesn't matter).
Jet Ski/Boat- Holds one mini fig, very small, fun to play with, looks nice
Swamp Base- Cool Bridge that can flip over sending everything overboard. Control Tower is held up by some supports, it has a neat design, and it's detailed and fun. there's a little dock that I think is for the Jet Ski. there's a little turret that can fire 2 flick fire missles. You have some pieces of foliage towards the bottom. The whole base is pretty sturdy, and it has lots of space for mini figs.

"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-22T14:27:42.403Z","Mission Status: Critical","This set is the latest in a LOOOOOOONGGGGGGGGG line of triumphs for the TLC. It comes with two crocodiles, an oversized motorbike, Agent Charge and Break Jaw minifigures, and a swamp base with an escape vehicle for Break Jaw. The set is FULL of playability possibilities. I will try my hardest to do this set justice.

The Base:
The background of this set is a swamp base that, according to the July-August issue of Lego Club Magazine, is in Louisiana. The base is very cool with a swampy look to it. (It's essentially a hut on stilts.) The trap works well and the flick-fire missile launcher is a good add-on. There is a little dock for Break Jaw's jet ski which is very neat. Plus, there are quite a few plant pieces around the bridge, but I would hve liked to have seen a leafy overhang to conceal the base. (Like in the Indiana Jones River Chase set.) Also has two crocodiles.

The Vehicles: 
The set comes with two vehicles, a jet ski for Break Jaw and a motorcycle for Charge. The motorcycle is really neat with its two rocket engines and powerful look. The jet ski, on the other hand, is too small to even worry about. I give this set a 4/5 because the vehicles are a bit out of proportion and the bridge is too short.

"legoguysw","2008-12-23T07:22:59.92Z","Yes and no.","This is a good and bad set. I'll explain with some pros and cons.
PROS
1.A motorbike. This is very good, with flames spurting out of the back and 'missiles'.
2.Crocodiles. DARK GREEN CROCODILES! These speak for themselves.
3.Bomb bridge mechanism. You push down on the 'Bomb' and theramp next to the ladder is pushed upwards. Works very well.
4.The minifigs. Very nice, with cool new torsos and legs.
That's really it for PROS.
CONS
1.The set just feels blank. There's not much special about it, it is quite dissapointing really. The raised hut is very bare, and the platforms outside are too. The set doesn't have the 'magic' some other sets do, like the old Drome Racers. You could do things with them, this... it's just boring.
However, it has some nice elements and if it is heavily modded, can be a good set.

So this set is not a must, but just optional.

Unfortunately, this is (in my opinion) one of the worst agents sets. The base is flimsy and unstable. I was very disappointed with my first breakjaw fig. He looks truly stupid and has a pointless jaw piece. He is easily the worst bad-guy. The cycle saves the set. It is one of the most detailed and realistic agents vehicle in a while. I was dissapointed with charges head. It has no dual side expression and has no hair-piece. Therefore, the extorshinests at lego force you to purchase a $50 dollar and over set to obtain charge.

The motorcycle
The robo crocs

The base itself. It was too flimsy and felt incomplete

There were some great large sets, such as the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8635-1/Mobile-Command-Center"">8635-1: Mobile Command Center</a>, and the volcanic detailing on&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8637-1/Volcano-Base"">8637-1: Volcano Base</a>&nbsp;is phenomenal. However the smaller sets in the line felt simple and rather generic. This set seems to suffer from the same short-falls, however there is enough pros here to more than balance that out.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts are standard fare, however there are exceptions: the roof piece is uncommon and very useful for buildings and the like, and I never tire of the different printings on the &#39;map&#39; pieces. The plants are common&nbsp;enough but add lots of detail and are very versatile, and the chrome rings of spikes are a nice novelty.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Whilst nothing overly exciting can be said for the humans of the set,&nbsp;the crocodiles are great fun when setting up your display: speaking of, I appreciate the change in recent years to the tails of the crocodiles so that they are now held in place by a technic pin - much more secure this way.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Its a fun enough display piece with enough extras to allow for customization, and the theme is generic enough that the set can be placed in with other lines and displays without to much inconsistency. The flipping bridge is a great addition and adds alot of character to your scene.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I dont remember the price of this set in Aus, but I would suggest that it fell into the $40 - 50 bracket. Whilst probably not a set worth tracking down now, in the year that this hit shelves it was probably one of the better set in that price range.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall the set has a few nice pieces, the crocs are always welcome, and the set can be discretely placed amongst your collection to flesh things out. Not a bad set, but nothing to run to the local for.&nbsp;</p>
