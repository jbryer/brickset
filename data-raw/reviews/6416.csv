The sharks are great. The larger sharks with white teeth are so much better than the old style of a single color.  Big enough to eat a minifig.

The boat is a great design.  With two hatches that have a great opening mechanism, it can hold a lot of stuff, not that there is really any extras to put into storage.  The mini-sub is okay.  It is a simple design, but functional.  It would have been  nice if it were hinged.

The grappling hook is the best part of the set. It uses a Racing wheel to wind the rope back into the boat just using rubber and pressure.  A simple design that really works well.  The net launcher is fun as well, actually working and throwing the net flat as it flies.

The letdown of the set is the little escape boat for Break Jaw.  It does not seem to have a motor, or steering, or really make sense for how BJ should sit in the boat.

I do like the bouy.  It is a really strong design, and a great addition to any bay or shipping set, with an evil flair.

"SaintElsewhere","2009-01-01T23:45:28.153Z","MUAHAHAHAHA!","  This set is JUST GREAT. 
  The boat is well-built and sturdy, plus the gadgets would make both Q and Batman proud. The net-launcher doesn't work to well, but can be easily fixed, and the harpoon/zipline is neat. 
  The buoy is great for fist-fights and makes a good add-on to the Volcano Base. The jet-ski launcher is neat, but the jetski itself is kind of small and a bit lame.
  The sharks are MUCH better than the old design. They're bigger, more intimidating, and can swallow a whole minifig. Plus, they have guns on their heads. MUAHAHAHAHAAAA!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Here is the closing for that review:

Features
There are a few features found on this set. Most I described above. But as a recap, you do have:
Includes Agent Trace, Agent Chase and Break Jaw minifigures, plus 2 sharks! Flick-fire missiles attached to one of the sharks. A net shooter. A subpod that docks to the speedboat. A flickfire harpoon and you can use the line as a zip line. There's a minifig zip line device. The engine compartments open on the speedboat. There's a hidden jetski in the buoy.

Final thoughts
The set as a whole isn't bad. I like the design of the dual hull design and how the subpod attaches to the back. For kids, it would have been neat to make it water suitable. But with holes in the boat, that's a no go.

My rating:
(When comparing to other Agent sets available at the time of the review 4/12/09)
Playability: 4 out of 5. It is playable. I love the sharks and the design on the boat. Moving it on smooth carpet, it doesn't snag so since you can't put it in water, that's not bad. 
Design: 4 out of 5. This ranks just behind the Agent Command Center. Which I also have. And ahead of all the rest of the sets.
Build experience: 3 out of 5. Easy to build. Nothing complicated and all parts was easy to join. Only not so good stuffs was the window sticker and how the net launcher doesn't hold the net well.
Overall: 4 out of 5. At 340 pieces, and paying close to $48 for it, it was a bit much. But now's the time to get it. As of today, you can get it on Lego.com for $29.99 on clearance. Bummer I bought it 5 days ago at $47.99.

"captain_radda_radda","2009-06-23T20:17:28.2Z","Bigger than I expected","I'll admit, when I boughtthis set, I was doubtful. The box wasn't very helpful either as it was damaged and torn. I built the set quickly and eagerly. You start off with the figs and the detachable sub. The sub is a lot more detailed than I thought and has a printed sonar brick. The figs are boring and the chase I got has overly painted eyes. The boye or tower thing is better than expected and has a launching boat. The boat is terrible and feels incomplete. Either no boat or okay boat but not this. The speed boat is pretty big and has a lot of features. The sub detaches with ease and the new harpoon piece is pretty sweet. I like the color scheme too. 

Pros:
The new sharks
The speed boat itself
The new harpoon
The tower thing

Cons:
Same agents
Same breackjaw
Crappy boat 

Overall:
I like it. If you really like agents or just feel like buying a good set, pick it up. If not, mabye you should pass. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"buzzandwoody2000","2010-03-24T19:04:43.45Z","SAVE AGENT TRACE!","<p>This set is very simple to build, and after that, it is very fun to play with. It will work better if you have other Agents sets, though. The harpoon is a little hard for starters, but I found my way through it easily. The sharks are very cool, and bigger than the old ones.</p>
<p>PROS:</p>
<p>Speedboat</p>
<p>Good use for speed and the weapins are good:&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nice sumbmrine thing that comes out the back</p>
<p>SHARKS:</p>
<p>Very big</p>
<p>Can eat a hole LEGO person</p>
<p>INFERNO THING (I can't remember the name)</p>
<p>Chain can hold people good</p>
<p>Boat hanger</p>

<p>CONS</p>
<p>SPEEDBOAT:</p>
<p>Could have one more minifigure.</p>
<p>SHARKS:</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>INFERNO THING:</p>
<p>The peice that holds up the chain will fall down</p>
<p>Not much room for Break Jaw</p>

<p>This is a good set, and I rate it 9/10 because off the cons for the Speedboat and Inferno Thing.</p>

"ggggggggggggggggggggggggg","2009-12-08T07:32:57.937Z","amazing set...","I absolutly love this set, I'll start with the minifigs, break jaw is cool and I like the 'jaw piece' as it really make's him look evil, next chase I quite like him and personally I don't mind at all that chase dosn't have a double face as I prefere(sp?) the side you get in this set, trace is quite good as the hare is very usefull but it can be hard to sit her down. Now to the set itself, I'll start with break jaw's bouy, this is very well designed and looks good from most angles and there is a button at the back where if you push it the break jaw's mini bout pops out knocking of the front panel of the bouy. Now to the sharks I like thes sharks alot although I perfer the old one's but these work better for a evil villain I like the laser's on there heads and yu can even fit a minifig in its jaws. Now for the best part of the set, the agnts speed bout(sp?), it is very playbale(sp?) as it has all sorts of features such as the net launcher which works quite well, and the harpoon which is fun to fire at the bouy and get the grappling zip line to take an agnet to the bouy safely, and I also really like the minisub as it is well desingned and you don't pull it out you move the light by it forward to release it. Also there are two compartments to store equipment. Overall I highly recommend this set to any lego fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Faefrost","2015-01-15T06:26:33.38Z","SHARKS WITH LASER BEAMS!!!!!","<p>One of the cooler sets of the oh so cool Agents line. The somewhat humbly named &quot;Speedboat Rescue&quot;. All around an incredible set.</p>

<p>Help Agent Chase rescue Agent Trace from certain death being fed to trapjaws&nbsp;remote controlled laser sharks. Because unlike them modern Ultra Agents, these boys were Old School back in 2008. They knew a good threat when they saw it. Nobody did classic peril better than the Inferno gang.</p>

<p>The set is comprised of the large speedboat build, including detachable mini sub, the slightly smaller nautical buoy that agent Trace is being suspended from, with hidden jetski for Trapjaw. and 2 large size sharks, only also seen in the 2009 Pirates line.</p>

<p>The Agents Speedboat is a wonderful play vehicle. Twin hulls with a ton of play features. Fire the flick fire grapling hook to string a zip line. Fire the net cannon. It all folds up and looks very very sleak. Perhaps too sleak. Attached to the back is a small enclosed mini sub. The only thing that some might take points off for are all the stickers. Normally I would agree with them, but this once I will make an exception. The stickers while way to many are quite frankly indispensible in this one. They so totally change the look of the set. They seem to literally glow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Inferno Bouy is a really nice solid build that adds a substantial presense to the set. More so than you would have thought. It looks great and blends in well with any ship MOC&#39;s or set displays.</p>

<p>The minifigs are perhaps the weakest link in the set, being three that we have seen before. But they make up for that with a lot of cool accesories.</p>

<p>And we can&#39;t talk about this set without talking about what may be the single greatest piece of box cover art Lego has ever printed. So much action going on in it. It feels so alive. The surging waves. The daring rescue. The North Sea oil platform in t he distance. It&#39;s just perfect.</p>

<p>If you have an opportunity to get this set at a reasonable price, grab it. No questions asked. It is pure brick built fun. The only negative is it does not float.</p>
