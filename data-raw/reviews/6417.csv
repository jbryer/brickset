"Lego_K","2008-08-11T21:49:27.577Z","Excellent set","The agents series of sets has already got my excited simply from viewing pics of what the sets looked like, having got my hands on some I'm very impressed. So lets take a look at the car chase set.

First off we got what most people will buy the set for - the car.

Its cool, very cool.
A sporty silver open top with blue highlights, the car is large (especially when compared to Speed racer sets or normal town cars) but still retains a sports look. The car is large due to the mechanics gone into making its working inventory or weapons.

To start with its has popup front guns, what every James Bond fan wants! you can angle them to be more like mortars/grenade launchers or just peeking over the top to fire in front.
To the rear we have a whole rack of 4 rocket launchers which raise up and neatly fire over the drivers head.

Inside the passenger seat can &quot;eject&quot; it occupant. Though I find it just sorta jolts them around rather than flying them out.

Overall a great fun ehicle to have and looks extremly good.

Next up is the helicopter, its larger than I thought it was gonna be which is probably down to its large engines on either side. Its has a working winch feature to lower the pilot down so he can board the car or try and snatch the laptop computer back from the agents hands!

The helicopter also comes equipped with for machine guns and to rocket launchers so you can have some good car chases with it.

Great overall design with the cnice colour combination of orange and black as used on all the bad guys vehicles.

Finally we have the gate, and unlike other Lego sets this one doesn't feel cheaply added into the box. It has a decent buid quality to it and looks good with its large double gate complete wih evil logos on the front and barbwire. It has two cameras overseeing it and a large searchlight.

When the car crashes through it hits a switch (works every time) to activate an alarm. A great little extra.

This is overall a great set to buy. A fantastic car, a decent helicopter with winch and a nice extra background element to round out a great set.

Highly recommended even with its &quot;slightly too much&quot; price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brickzone","2008-08-17T18:32:48.53Z","Silver not gold","First I should start by saying that this set has one of the coolest Lego cars to ever be in a set (but you already knew that). The helicopter is interesting, as the cockpit has no floor, so Spyclops can descend in a quite convincingly spider-like manner (from a thread wound/unwound by the rotors). The gate is also quite well done, the girders and grilles are nice to have, but the best part of the gate is the sound effect brick. It lets rip with a whooping alarm sound, quite loud.

The car is quite intricate, with a sturdy technic base, and mechanisms for an ejector seat, missiles raising from the bonnet (hood), and flick fire missiles slowly raised from the rear by turning a cylinder on the back of the car. The silver bricks look so shiny, and the whole car is very James Bond-esque.

However, all things considered, the set is not quite perfect, as it's a bit too bundled together. I think a lot of people would like to just get the car. At most, bundle the gate *or* helicopter, but adding both means it is just a bit pricy of a set (and you aren't so interested in those added items - notwithstanding the fact they are reasonably done).

So, four stars - silver, not five star gold like Volcano Base.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-09T21:00:41.607Z","Fine Car","I actually like this set because of the really awesome car with the pop up rockets and the gate. The helicopter is OK but not the best one I have seen. The minifigs are a good addition too. This is a set that is worth a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-14T12:06:42.937Z","Save the day with the Agents Turbocar!","I recently got this set after my foot was squashed by a Honda Accord. (DO NOT ask!) I really enjoy this set and it keeps me sane while I'm hobbling around on crutches. Anyway...

-The Car-
The only reason why anyone buys this set is for the car. It has flick-fire missiles, pop-up machine guns, and an ejector seat. The car also sports several new pieces including the windshield and hubcaps. The ejector seat doesn't work but the rest of the gadgets are fine. Also, a lot of the pieces are in a new, theme-exclusive colour, metallic silver! THIS is what the Aston Martin DB5 from &quot;Goldfinger&quot; wants to be.

-The Helicopter-
This is the first really intimidating bad guy helicopter ever put into a set. It has machine guns, flick-fire missiles, and a retractable winch that raises/lowers Spy-clops when you turn the rotor. The only problem here is that the winch is a little fiddly to get in. 

-The Gate-
Last but not least, the gate. It is in a league of its own compared to other Lego gates in that it STAYS IN ONE PIECE when you pick it up. It has two cameras and a searchlight, as well as a rather  sensitive (and loud) alarm brick that activates when you open the gate. There is also a second henchman to man the gate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoforever__3553","2008-11-19T00:08:23.593Z","the turbocar chase"," My first Agents set is the Turbocar chase and it 
does not dissapoint!First up is the Turbocar.The
Turbocar is a slick silver and blue car with no 
hood.However,it has 4 hidden missiles inside the
trunk that lift up.The Turbocar has red lights
on the back and yellow ones on the front.It has 2 seats.1 is supposed to &quot;eject&quot;,but the
ejecting function works EXTREMELY poor,so I modi-
fied it to seat another minifig.It also has 2
laser cannons in the &quot;front&quot; trunk.The front hood
has a hidden compartment where you can store 
Chase's gadgets.The missiles are activated by
twisting a piece on the rear end while the laser
cannons are activated by pushing a part back.There
is also a radar in the interior.There are few
stickers on the car(yay!).

 The Helicopter is Black,orange,and grey with
a translucent smoke cockpit.There is a winch that
allows spy-clops to go up or down when the propeller is spun.There are 2 flick-fire missiles on both sides.A propeller on the side can
also be spun.

 Now,for the gate.The gate is black,light grey,dark
grey, silver with a little orange. There are 2
surveillance cameras and a search light.There is
also a what looks lika a control panel and a 
ladder.There's a ramp on the back.The gimmick is that when something goes through the gate,an alarm
goes off.It happens bypushing the gate outwards,the gate pushes a small peg that triggers the sound brick.

 Last but not least,The minifigs.The set comes with
3 minifigs.Not a lot for a $70.00(CAD)set,but 
there isn't a lot of space to put them,so yeah.
 
 Agent Chase's body is the standard agents uniform
or body and legs,but has a flip-head.One face(the
one I use more)has sunglasses/spyglasses with a
smirk.The other has him in a kind of upset look
without his sun/spyglasses.He also has black hair.

 Spy Clops is basically half a minifig(the top half)
with a set of spider-esque legs.He uses the 
standard Dr.Inferno henchman body.He has a 
detachable &quot;backpack&quot; for the winch.He also has 
black hair.
 
 The henchman just uses the standard henchman
body and normal legs.He has the crook/thug
face and a toque.
 
 Overall,I recommend The Turbocar Chase if you have 
the money(once again,it's $70.00 CAD).

"captain_radda_radda","2009-06-15T16:38:34.653Z","The best agent set ","The set truly soars. I love the car. It has a speed racer-like build and so many weapons. The new lap-top is amazing and when folded up, fits in the minifigures hands. The gate is large and the alarm works every time. 

Pros:
Simply everything

Cons:
Well, the spider copter is a bit opened at the bottom, but thats fine. 

Overall:
A must-have for any Lego fan. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"fujikuro","2009-03-26T07:29:35.437Z","Very nice","A very nice set here.  Though, as mentioned before, probably too pricey for what you get.  Most likely should have been around $45, rather than $50.  The car is incredibly well done.  Lots of play features and a great design (though absolutely enormous compared to the size of a minifig).  The helicoptor suffers from being Spyclop's vehicle, as you cannot fit any other minifigs into the cockpit.  Seems like they could have figured out a way around that.  I would rather have had a full 'coptor than the working winch feature.  It's an OK play feature, but I just can't see using it much.  I'd want spinning rotors instead.  Anyway, Lego at least gets points for trying something interesting.  The gate is a great add-on if you can get the volcano set too, as the two will work together very well.  Overall a very nice set, but not absolutely top-notch.  I'd give it slightly over an 8/10 so have to round to a 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:
1. Great car design.
2. Great helicopter design.
3. OK gate design.
4. Spy clops minifig is awesome.
5. rare silver pieces.
6. siren brick.

"james3426","2009-10-25T18:45:54.45Z","James Bond car getaway","This set just screams, ""James Bond"" because the car is just like something from one of the movies. Also, the idea is just like a James Bond movie. The features of the turbo car are just like a super-spy car and it has pop-up lasers and flip-up missiles. The disappointment though, is that ejector seat that does not work. Spy Clopps is  my favorite minifigure from this set because of his legs and the head. The gate has an alarm that works well. It also has move-able cameras and spotlight. Another thing that will open your eyes are those rare barbed wire rings.

pros:
Car has flip-up lasers and missiles.
Move-able cameras and spotlight.
Spy-Clopps.
Helicopter can lower Spy-Clopps with blades.
Mantax pincers.

cons:
Ejector seat does not work.

A fine set to add to an Agents collection. To those of you who do not know what  Mantax pincers are, they are the helicopter's claws.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
