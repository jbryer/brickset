"orukaia","2008-06-01T17:42:32.45Z","Truly the Ultimate Spy Vehicle!","I picked this set up at my local Toys R Us the other day and I was soooo excited. I opened the well desgigned box and poured out the contents. There are 4, yes 4, instruction booklets, 2 sticker sheets, and many packages of legos(I would hope so!) There are bags numbered up to '7', but there are a couple numbers with mutliple bags. 
It was great fun to build, took me about an hour and a half, and I was enoying every second of it.
  --Onto the set itself--
In total the set includes the big truck, 5 mini Agents vehicles,the evil hover jet, and 7 minifigs. I'll start with the minifigs-
               ---AGENTS---
 --Agent Chase- He's the one with the black hair and the sunglasses; you can also turn his head around and he has a plain face w/out the sunglasses and mic. Pretty good mini-fig, nice costume design and cool hair.
 --Agent Fuse- the one w/the brown hair(same style as Chase's); pretty good face, same outfit as Chase. Also has a turn around head (with a frightened face on back)
 --Agent Charge- the one with the brown flat-top and the stubble; again, same outfit as the others, but I think his face is kind of ugly. Cool hair, though.
 --Agent Trace- the girl agent; probably my favorite (or tied with chase) she has the same kind of outfit as the other agents, but a little more feminized(if you know what I mean)but she has an awesome new hair-stlye that I think is really cool; the best girl mini-fig hair/face ever IMO.
               ---VILLAINS---
 --Dr. Inferno- An awesome evil mini-fig; he has the awesome black spiky hair with the orange highlights. His face is awesome; it's crazy looking and has that cool villainous scar across his eye.
 --Spyclops- Awesome face with the 8 mechanical eyes; cool outfit design, and awesome spider legs!
 --Gold tooth- Has a helmet for flying the hover jet, weird face with a golden-tooth grin(hence the name) same outfit as spyclops but with normal legs.
               ---VEHICLES---
The hover jet- Probably my favorite mini-vehicle in the set, the orange/black color scheme is awesome and the wing design is amazingly cool. I thought it looked flimsy but it holds up very well.
 --The Agents mini jet-ski- My least favorite mini-vehicle, but not bad, the jet-ski goes in the back on the truck on a little slide-out wall thing, it's only a few bricks but designed pretty good for it's size.
 --The Agents motor-boat- pretty cool little boat, it's the old raft piece(but in a cool new color) but has an added engine, steering wheel, and cool guns. It goes in the holding bay in the bottom of the truck.
 --The mini car- a pretty cool little car, sturdy desing, and also has the cool little guns on the sides. It goes in the holding bay in the bottom of the truck with the motorboat
 --The ATV- A neat little ATV with added guns in the back and a latch-point for the crane to lift it into and out of the main area of the big truck.
 --The Jet- a sweet little jet with fold out wings; although it has a very cube-shaped rear-bottom which looks kind of lame, the rest of the design makes up for it. It launches from the front of the back section of the truck, which folds out to reveal the jet. It's waayy cool.

--THE TRUCK ITSELF--
I'll start with the front of the truck- It's pretty cool, not a lot to it; the top opens to put a mini-fig in, and the grill in front opens to reveal 4 missiles(which don't fire BTW) Cool, realistic design overall.
The back of the truck- 
   The main, amazing spectacle of the set; I loved this whole thing! The front section folds out to reveal/launch the mini-jet! The bottom holds the mini-car and motorboat, and the back/bottom slide out to reveal the jet-ski. The ATV parks in the main section part. The cool little prison cell is pretty neat, with cool laser-bars sticker on a clear wall piece, which looks pretty cool. The back of the cell falls open when you pull a lever on the right side of the truck so Dr. Inferno can escape.
There are a lot of tool racks and boxes which hold many cool things, including diving equipment, saws, walkie-talkies, 2 laptops, a hatchet, and multiple guns. 
   A really cool part is when you open the truck, a light-piece folds out and shines on one of two trans-clear pieces (one with a picture of Dr. Inferno, the other an image of his sharks) and projects the image on the mission-brief screen. It's really cool, but works best in a dull/dark room. The crane is pretty cool and is used for lifting the ATV in and out. There are a couple of seats behind the jet launching area with control panels which is a cool little addition.
As you can see in the picture, the top and one wall of the truck folds open to access the inside, and has a bunch of cool satellites and guns on it. :P 

This set is super-amazing and definitely worth buying. It provides hours of fun and playability and id awesome even just to look at! The only thing I would have changed would be to add a few more Agents mini-figs to man all the stations and vehicles.
     Overall, I give the set a 10/10

"cephalopoid","2008-06-01T20:00:29.59Z","Very Clever Set","This is the first non-castle/Star Wars set I've picked up in years and years, and it was worth it.

The figs:
I love the figs, especially the villans.  Dr. Inferno's robotic arm is awesome, as is Spy Clops with his spider legs.

The Build:
The truck has got a Technic frame, and is very rigid and solidly built.  The little vehicles are simple to build but very vroomable and swooshable.  The best part is that all but the villian's glider are tucked away into the trailer of the truck. 
What but the biggest smile on my face were the details . . . the ladder on the side of the trailer, the two seats in the trailer for the agents, and the projector that flashes slides onto the wall!  This set is one of the most clever I've built.
Overall, the whole set took about 4 hours to build (this was while watching The Wire and Taxi Driver).

The price was good too . . . you get a ton of vehicles and a ton of brick here for the price.

This set was a joy to build.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Aleiobot","2008-08-01T18:56:53.39Z","Better than the Alpha Team one!","This I must say is the best agent set so far! (I wonder how good the volcano base is) This set is so big and includes so much stuff. There's plenty of vehicles, minifigures, and accesories for hours of play! 

Pros: 7 minifigures (4 agents and 3 cyborgs.)
      The rare Dr. Inferno minifigure.
      A WORKING light projector
      Tons of accesories and weapons
      7 vehicles (2 cars, 2 jets, 1 truck, and 2 boats)
      Buggy lift
      Stabalizer leg
      Escape hatch
      Secret areas

      Minifigures' changing faces
      
Cons:the hidden missles don't really fire.:(
     the set is kind of unstable without the cab.

"sudorum","2008-07-02T21:54:04.67Z","its the inside that counts","thanks to Orukaia, there's not much left to say about the set,other than it is brilliant. has a very detailed inside, two laptops, and rare characters. there are seven vehicles in all. the movile base itself, two aircraft vehicles, two cars, and a speed boat and jet ski. the dr. inferno character is predictable in the case that he has a scar on his face, like every other story plot lego villain. a highly advised set",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EnReVe","2008-11-11T14:40:34.467Z","Outstanding LEGO set ! Great design and tons of fun","I have been a LEGO fan all my life. I am in my 30's and I remember owning just one LEGO set (221 pieces which I used to count before and after building). It was an old Castle set with 4 figures and a siege tower. It was my favorite toy. So to buy a set with so many figures and pieces for my son was very exciting for me after all these years.

My son is 4 years old and he loves playing with his LEGOs (Duplo). We build everything together and playing this with him sure beats playing any video game or anything else.

This set is particular is outstanding. There are just so many things that you can make in this set. We have not yet made the whole truck as we make one small thing everyday. With over 1000 pieces, it can take a while to put together (especially with an impatient 4 year old). He is very happy with just the small cars and planes that we have put together so far. I look forward to putting the truck together and make it all come together. The figures are so cool as are the small gadgets that we get with the set like the laptop, projector, little guns, tools, flippers etc..

My wife who usually does not play with boy toys joined us in building and was blown away by the detail of this set. She sits down everyday now and joins us after dinner to put something small together. No TV for us! Once we put this together, we are going to combine this with the DUPLO Thomas train track set and have tons of fun.

The price on Amazon is pretty cool ($20 cheaper than on the LEGO website). Great great deal and I would still pay the full price if it were not on sale. Great toy for anyone and everyone who appreciates good quality, design, detail and battery free toys.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"haoye","2009-11-27T08:10:32.607Z","This set has, quite possibly, ruined me for all other sets","the premise:

I had heard good things about this set from people in my LUG, but it had already been discontinued by that point, and I wasn't willing to spend an exorbitant amount on bricklink or other sets for a copy.  Imagine my surprise when Toys R Us had them on sale for Black Friday this year at 40% off the list price of $90.  In the end, the cost came out to be just shy of $59 (including tax), and I ended up buying 4 (to share with friends).

the summary:

After building it, I'm not sure I want to share anymore - I just want to keep all 4 copies for myself!

the details:

Ignoring the actual construction, you get a decent amount of rare pieces and a ton of other pieces in this set.  Just going by the piece count, this set is already a good value at its list price for a non-creator, non-technic set.  The minifigs are all different (well, the agents have the same body, but with different heads and hairpieces), and come with many minifig accessories, including scuba gear, different color pistols, and 2 laptops.  Add to that the pieces in dark blue, orange, and metallic silver, and there are some very cool parts in this set.

Once you build it, all other toys pale in comparison.  I'm not talking about other LEGO sets, but other toys that are designed to be played with.  I was never a big fan of LEGO play features in sets (I absolute hate the flicking missiles on what seems to be all new Star Wars sets), but this one has so much cool stuff in it: the equipment storage, folding everything into the trailer, the light brick that works superbly as a projector, etc., etc.  I have seen very few other toys that come close to this level of awesome playability - the really high-end giant robot toys (e.g. Transformers) that only seem to get released into Japan (not the silly US versions that replace diecast metal with plastic) come to mind.  And this is a LEGO set, with the ability to be modified, reconstructed into something new, and combined easily with a growing LEGO collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Brock_the_Builder","2009-05-11T09:53:40.623Z","Awesome Truck, Large Scale, Cool Features","This set is awesome!  It includes numerous unique parts-- many of which you will be seeing for the first time!  I had wanted this set since I saw it at a Lego store last summer.  I was able to get one last week just before they sold out.

The beginning of the build is a little tedious as you are assembling all of the small accessory vehicles and minifigs.  Shortly thereafter, the truck begins.  The tractor part looks very cool, but could use a few more features (working doors, for example).  I was impressed with the use of Technic bricks to build the truck/trailer frames-- this set uses A LOT of technic parts.  I prefer this 'build it yourself' design as opposed to the large base part given in 7743 (Police Mobile Command).

The finished product is simply outstanding.  The truck has so many great features and gadgets-- weapons, computers, controls, tools, a LIGHT-UP projector, a jail cell (with breakout door), and so much more!  And when it's all closed up and ready to roll, it looks amazing.  If you own this set, keep it.  If you don't have this set, find one.  You will not be disappointed.

Pros:  New/unique parts, lots of minfigs, light-up projector, looks REALLY COOL!

Cons:  Hard to drive on your town/city streets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"SaintElsewhere","2009-05-22T11:03:07.39Z","Easily the Agents crown jewel","I absolutely LOVE this thing. From the truck to the minifigs, it's just excellent. My favourite aspects are the mini-vehicles, the hidden gadgetry inside the truck, and the villain minifigs.

Pros:
truck is HUGE
the ever-cool Dr. Inferno, Spy-clops, and Gold Tooth figs
enough weapons to go around
mini-vehicles
Spy-clops has a flipping BAZOOKA
this time, the price actually IS worth it

under the truck, you kind of have to jam the car and boat into the storage space

Agents' mini-jet is blocky at the back",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"HQuiff","2009-01-04T14:49:47.437Z","Perfect!","Well, where to start?! I have 100's of sets, none of them are as good as this beauty. I was put off it by the colors at first, but then a few weeks before Christmas I was looking for a nice flashy set to get for Christmas. When one of the staff at the shop there showed me it In detail I fell in love with it's functions and design. Also, the price is really worth it, 100$ is awesome for such a great, large truck.


Pro(s):
 - It comes with 7 vehicles including it's self and the Inferno Jet.
 - You get every Agent and three Inferno's, including Dr. Inferno himself.     
 - It's comes in around 60cm's long.
 - The back off the truck come off from the front very easily.
 - Everything fits in well and there's plenty of space to put in your army of Agents.
 - Added Gadgets and weapons are great bonuses.
 - Front part can fit two people.
 - The reflection from the projector on to the wall shines perfectly.
 - Roof & compartments can easily open.


Con(s):
 - It's hard to put together, make sure you follow the instructions well, even a tiny mistake can ruin the whole thing.


Well... I can't have asked for a better set. I would highly recommend it to anybody looking for a cool Agents set. An to finish off I just have to mention that Spy-Clops is one of the best made minifigures ever! And Dr. Inferno's spiky hair rocks!

"MetroiD","2009-02-08T16:49:23.873Z","Believe it or not, Agents rock - and their truck is better than you could ever expect!","This one is quite probably the best LEGO set I have ever owned, period.

I have one thing to say to anyone who doesn't believe me - don't trust the pics you see on the internet. Once you have the complete set in your hands, you'll know what I'm talking about.

It's not just the GREAT minifigs - Spyclops is quite simply awesome, and so is Dr Inferno - or rather, his hair; besides, the agents' faces can be reversed in order to express different emotions depending on the situation you've put them in.

It's not the mini-vehicles either, in fact they're really nothing too great, but when you put the whole thing together and actually manage to fit each and every one of them inside of the truck... it's simply mind-blowing.

And talking about the truck... Now that, that IS what this is all about. I had read a LOT about this set and only considered buying it since it was available at a knock-down price, otherwise 90 EUR for an ""automobile"" set seemed too much for me... But after putting this together, I've changed my mind - no matter how much you pay for it, this one is worth every last cent. When I was finished, I just closed up the truck and marvelled at it for a few minutes - it is THAT perfect. No, I'm not 13. And yes, I have seen my share of big and awesome LEGO sets. Despite that, this one still comes out on top.

Usually I buy sets, build them and keep them for about a week, after which I add the bricks to my collection in order to build a nice MOC with the new parts. But with this one, I'm pretty much sure I'll keep it as it is for ages, simply because it is hands down beautiful.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The little vehicles: first the quad, well its a quad...it has 2 missiles on the back and a hook so it can be picked up by the crane in the main truck and it fits there nicely, now the car, its a nice car that just fits nicely under the truck and it has two adjustable, non flick fire missiles on the side and some rare silver pieces ;), now the boat, its a cool little boat with an engine on the back, missiles on the side and a steering wheel, not much else to say, now the hidden jet ski, as i said its hidden, and it hides in the back of the truck nicely, and the jet ski itself isnt much, it has 2 missiles, a silver engine and some handlebars, finally theres the agents plane, its wings fold inwards so it can be stored in the front of the truck by a sticking out peice that slots into a....well a slot on the truck and its hinged so it can hide and then be released ;). the enemies plane: its a cool plane with a rare peice that covers the cockpit and it has two wongs each with a single propeller so it can hover and a couple of laser cannons on the side. and now onto the minifigs: theres 7, 4 agents and evil doc inferno, spy clops who is half man half spider and then gold tooth who pilots their plane. now onto the main part, the truck itself :)--well it starts off closed up in 'undercover mode' and then BAM alsorts of doors and stuff to open up, on the front it opens up to reveal a plane (as i said before ;)) and its sides open too, then the underside opens on both sides to reveal the car and boat, then on the back theres a little handle to pull out the jetski, then the main door opens up nicely and reveal: a prison which contains the locked-up dr inferno, a....well a parking space for the quad, which is lifted via a crane which swivels and goes up and down, then theres some storage compartments, 1 next to the prison cell, and 1 in the middle with laptops, scuba diving gear, hooks to put stuff onto and little storage cupboards, and then the final one is on the left with two little drawers for storing things. and on the big door there are, missiles, satellite recievers transmiter thingys and little green...dishes? i guess u could call them. now theres a sticker that you put on that is used for......the light up projector! it does actually lightup and it folds forward for storage and there are a couple of see through bricks with pictures of dr .i. and what i think is a cyborg shark from a different agents set so yeah thats a really cool feature, then where the plane is stored there are allsorts of computers and stuff like that..the whole thing offers loads of playability and a ton of detailing but it isnt for the inexperienced builder as its a bit tricky here and there, but i seriously recommend this not only to agents fans but people looking for one heck of a truck, and if you compare it to for instance the lego city mobile police command truck it is huge in coparison..........oh and if you do but it it is quite wide 12 bricks wide. so yeah i hoped this helped and thanks for reading :) :D<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box was giant and i mean GIANT. it had one main image on the front of the truck and all of the team in action and also it had a flip up page which is when you can pull up the front of the box to reveal more imformation on the set. The filp up page included all the play features and accessories and Minifigures that come in this great set. it took me about 5 minutes just to read that!

"JoeJones","2015-02-20T17:33:39.787Z","Possibly the GREATEST Lego set ever made and certainly the BEST vehicle","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>4 Instruction manuals express the grandeur of this set and the box is also pretty great in size too. Cool picture showing the great play value too, which i will cover later in this review.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set contains over 60 rare&nbsp;dark navy blue parts which make this set very valuable to me and other builders as this colour, as i have already stated, is rare and also very useful for building dark navy blue things. Fantastic!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Great selection of Minifigures&nbsp;apart from the, sadly, overused Agent Chase. :(</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building is made simpler for people like me, by having 7 numbered bags. Unfortunately there are quite a few stickers but these do not spoil the model or playability, which i don&#39;t focus on as i build rather than play.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A great looking truck which you can store all of your Agents in, unless you place them where the un-fireable rockets on the roof&nbsp;are above. When placed underneath them the Minifigures cause them to fall. The trailer can be detached and there is this stand that stops it from rolling away. Brilliant!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Loads of mini-vehicles that make this model better than the Ultra-Agents one. The colour scheme is also better and follows the same colour scheme as previous Lego Agents sets. Cool!, so, thank you for reading this and listening to my views,&nbsp;and hopefully i will see you in the next review.</p>

"Trueblox","2018-08-28T19:29:07.24Z","Best. Lego set. EVER!!!!!!!!","<p>Hello. My name is Trueblox, and today i will review Agents set from 2008, 8635, Mobile Command Center.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the box first:</p>

<p>the front of the box shows the Agents in a battle with Dr Inferno&#39;s henchmen and trying to capture Dr Inferno.</p>

<p>The front of the box actually folds, to show the play features. Yeah, there&#39;s a lot and i will cover all of them. (Wish me luck.)</p>

<p>The back shows how to open the base. That&#39;s it. (Pretty disappointing, actually.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s look at the minifigures (7 in total)</p>

<p>Agent Chase: The leader of the group (and the most common agent, and one of the first minifigures with a double-sided face), he definitely looks the coolest, tho. I like this little guy. He comes with the normal agents suit and some black hair, and he&#39;s good some nice sunglasses, and he has a 2nd angry face.</p>

<p>Agent Fuse: The mechanical pilot boi, this kid knows everything about gadgets, and piloting jets. He comes with the normal agents suit and a ginger version of agent chase&#39;s hair. He has some cool glasses, too. he&#39;s got a 2nd scared face.</p>

<p>Agent Charge: Basically the tough guy of the group, has a brown hair, and has only 1 face with a smug face and beard combo. He comes with the normal agents suit.</p>

<p>Agent Trace: Basically both the hero and the damsel in distress. She comes with long, brown hair. Her face shows a headset with bright red lipstick, and her 2nd face is a scared version, she also comes with the normal women agents suit.</p>

<p>Gold Tooth: Dr Inferno&#39;s most reliable henchman, he comes with a cool helmet with gold visor, the normal henchman suit with the logo on the back, and he only has a 1-sided face, showing an eyepatch and also, his teeth are all gold. (of course.)</p>

<p>Spyclops: He comes with Charges hair in black, his legs are are brick-built, and look super cool. He comes with the normal Inferno henchman torso, and his face is soo cool! he has 4 mechanic eyes with an angry grin. 2nd best figure.</p>

<p>Dr Inferno: One of the main reasons i bought this set, his mechanical arm is just awesome. You can replace the claw with anything (a saw, crystal, the ENTIRE command center, or a chicken. I don&#39;t know why you would want that, but you can.), and his suit is just a lab coat with the inferno logo on the back. his head has a scratched eye, he has an evil grin, and his hair is exclusive to him, and it&#39;s beautiful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now; the truck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The truck is a chrome silver dark-ish blue color, with a yellow A (Agents logo) on the back sides of the truck. that&#39;s basically all of it. But, once you open up everything:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get into the play features. (Get ready for a wall of text, ma bois!)</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the front part of the truck, then the back trailer part.</p>

<p>The truck&#39;s ceiling can be flipped so you can put 2 (or 3, if you make one stand up in the middle) minifigures, and the front can be opened to show 2 hidden guns and 4 hidden missiles. So cool.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not even the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>The trailer can open up in 7 parts (8 if you count the cell escape play feature)</p>

<p>on the far left part, both sides and the front open up to show a control panel and a jet. The jet, of course can be took out of its little &quot;resting&quot; place. Just remember to fold out the wings and the back part so it won&#39;t fall down and, well, crash. Oh yeah, the chairs turn around in the control panel room as well.</p>

<p>In the lower middle part, both parts open to reveal a hidden (and good-looking) car and a dinghy boat. they&#39;re both loaded with 2 guns for your agent-y needs.</p>

<p>In the back part, you can take out an agents jetski with 2 guns on the side. It looks cute.</p>

<p>In the middle part, the entire left side of the trailer opens up to reveal the command center. (Big surprise, i know) And in it, there is: a mission brief panel with a light-up brick and transparent bricks of mission 4: speedboat rescue and Dr Inferno&#39;s face, and they can both be shown on the mission brief panel.</p>

<p>A little section of gizmos and gadgets next to the panel, full of diving, flying, and fixing equipment. right in front of that is a crane with a 4x4 mini jeep, which the crane can lower.</p>

<p>And at the very end, is a prison cage, where you can put 1 of the henchmen (usually Dr. Inferno) and another place full of gadgets and guns. One of the walls from the cage can be destroyed using a lever in the back, allowing freedom to the captured individual.</p>

<p>The Inferno jet only has 2 movable rotors and 2 movable guns. that&#39;s it for that little build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Phew, that made my hands hurt. Well, here&#39;s my final verdict:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is a must-get. Even if it takes 7 hours to build (That&#39;s how long it took me, no joke) it&#39;s a satisfying build and it looks good both as a display and play piece. If you got the money (Around 300 Euro), Buy it. It&#39;s one of the best lego sets i own and won&#39;t be beaten anytime soon. (Well, until i get the Underground Mining Station when i got the money for it, until then, this set is the king.) So then, this was my review on this monster of a set. My hands hurt and i&#39;ve been doing this for an entire evening. I hope you enjoyed.</p>
