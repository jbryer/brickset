"hustla187","2008-08-21T16:20:29.7Z","Reminds Me of the Divers sets","This set sort of reminds me of the Divers sets back in the late 1990s. The boat is pretty cool and has some great features. The submarine is a bit weird looking and looks like a spaceship. The minifigs are fine also. With the exception of the submarine, everything is pretty good.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Darth_Shockwave","2008-09-05T10:36:21.577Z","A great Vs set","Lego have given us another Vs set, which I'm all in favor off. The Agents have bolsted thier aqua forces with the arrival of the submarine. I'd have to say this new sub is probably one of the best designed subs that Lego have done, the bad guy trawler boat is a great model also. Both vehicles are equally matched in terms of firepower, the set is reminicent of the movie Enemy down Below, which is a WW2 movie about an American Battleship fighting a German U-boat.
The detailing on the sub is done quite well, with the stickers showing water vents, pumps and other machinery. I personally think the best parts on the sub are the missiles that come out from the top, the spacious cockpit for Agent Charge, and the torpedoes that are either side. Also notice how the sub has a small periscope, nice little detail there.
The trawler boat is also done nicley, it gives a menacing look to the design, with the barbed wire and depth charges on either side. The missile is nicely added to the boat, without gettin in the way. I do like the little touches like the search light, and main control room.
The submersibles are also nicley desiged each being completly different to the other, and both can be stored onto thier larger counterparts.

Pro's
Great Vs set
Both models are as good as each other
Radioactive Octopus
Hidden missiles
Flick torpedoes
An exclusive new bad guy

Con's
No space to put Agent Chase when he's not on the submersible, well there are hand rails but they are placed rather dangerously to the main engines.

Overall I'd say this is one of the best Agents sets available, I'd recommed getting this set as it's so much fun, which Lego should be. Also this set goes very well with the Seaboat rescue set. 
Highly recommened.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2008-10-13T15:38:50.543Z","Underrated! ","This is my favorite set from the whole Agents line. Here's why:

- The sub is sleek and well constructed 

- It comes with a rare minifigure, Slimeface

- Cool blue octopus

- The enemy boat, while not very good, still packs a lot of useful parts

- More navy blue than any other Agents set

- Flick fire missiles look better than they usually do

- Deployable mini-subs

- Good price considering what you get

There are some cons though. See below:

- The cockpit of the sub will sometimes break off when you try to close it.

- The boat is basically a throwaway. 

- I would have liked a few more accessories.

"legoville410","2008-10-26T13:02:45.34Z","Could be a little better.....","Not much room for improvement in this set,on legos side or the builders, especially on the sub.

Anyway boat is AWESOME w/ firing cannon and moving missles

Pros:
Boat
Treasure
Agents(Who now have id cards on left leg)

Cons:
sub could be better



Overall it is a great set.

"SaintElsewhere","2009-06-26T16:35:59.623Z","Ship of Spies","Well... Not really a ship, per se. More of a submarine and fishing trawler combo platter. I'm just making a Get Smart reference here, so bear with me. Anyway...

The Submarine:
The submarine is a large, powerful, sturdy vehicle. It has a compartment for the treasure, a compartment for Chase's scuba-jet, four flick-fire missiles, and two hidden non-firing missiles. The sub is amazingly long, longer than I expected, and really quite lovely when just sitting on display. There is a small control room, but unfortunately it only has room for one figure.

The Boat:
The boat is really nothing more than a duded-out fishing trawler, but that's okay, 
because it has flick-fires, a searchlight, and a missile launcher. On the bow there's also a small rack with a pair of binoculars and a speargun. Not to mention the barbed wire. That's a neat. Unfortunately, the missile launcher takes up so much room there's barely anywhere to stand on deck.

The Figures, Accessories, and Everything Else:
  Well, I like the octopus. I'm pretty sure that that's a new colour, and Chase's scuba-jet is neat, But Slime Face's scuba-jet is a little small, under-armed, and can't be place anywhere on the boat due to a lack of space.
  Break Jaw and Charge are nothing new, and Chase is only a slight variation on the figure included in Speedboat Rescue, but Slime Face... now HE'S interesting. The translucent head, slime dripping down his wetsuit, and bizarre facial expression make him one heckuva minifigure.
  The accessories are: a pair of binoculars, three spearguns, two scuba tanks, one pair of flippers, and, of course, the treasure. Not much to say there. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ryan661","2008-12-08T23:26:57.39Z","A good addition to the Agents theme","This set has some pretty cool features like slime face's head and body which is covered in slime.

here are some pros and cons:

pros:
slime face!
cool translucent octupus
sea scooters
treasure
secret storage compartment
cool place to store Agents mini sub

cons:
boat is a little short for its width
evil sea scooter should have some sort of weapon
Agent Chase has the city head not the Agents

Other then that This is a great addition to the Agents theme",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"parchioso","2010-04-02T10:59:36.67Z","Why it had to be on sale?","<p>Somehow I got an impression that this set did not seem to be a hot item, but after I built it, I wonder why it had to be on sale and sold at very low price?</p>
<p>Yes, the boat that comes this set for is not that good really, although the torpedo launcher and the head lights looks quite nice to me, but the overall design and color mix is too ordinary, and beware of the flick-fire action, it is very strong and can hurt.</p>
<p>But what really impress me in this set is the submarine, with a flip-up missle launcher and side missiles, plus a Bionicle claw at the front, it is well armed. The compartments for keeping a chest box is also a nice design, as well as the docking mechanism for the small sub, the whole vehicle is good for play and display. I would even imagine manuvering the vehicle in deep sea myself!</p>
<p>Another goodie from this set is the octopus, and I think this glow-in-the-dark version is available only from this set? </p>
<p>I personally like the Submarine and the docking mini-sub, the octopus and the scooters, the rest are ok but not that important to me, I got it at regular price but still find it acceptable.</p>

"james3426","2009-10-25T18:59:11.39Z","Awesome submarine!","This is my favorite Agents set. The submarine is my favorite part because, it has flip-up missiles, flick-fire missles, slide-out mini-sub, storage compartment, and a Pohatu Nuva climbing claw! (The silver thing on the front.) The ship has flick-fire missiles and a move-able blunt launcher. The other things include a treasure chest with pinkish and greenish-yellow crystals, a glow-in-the-dark squid, and a smaller mini-sub that Slime-Face can hold on to. 

pros:
Submarine has cool functions.
Squid.
Slime-Face.
Blunt launcher.

Cons:
NONE!

An awesome Agents set. Get this if you can find it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
