<p>It was very simple, but it had quite a variety of pieces that you don&#39;t see anymore, like a door within a door frame&nbsp;or a thick arch.</p>

<p>The bucket itself was nice, and it had photos of builds that looked so cheerful and happy. I especially liked the yellow-faced &quot;girl&quot; that came with the set. Always brought a smile to my face.</p>

<p>This is not something you need to go out of your way to find, but it shows a time when lego sets&nbsp;emphasised&nbsp;simplicity and imagination over themes and unique pieces.</p>
