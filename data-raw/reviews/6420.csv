"orange_808","2008-07-29T13:49:50.67Z","I love it!!","I went to toysrus and this was the one set that caught my eye. The second i got home i started to build it. It took me about 4 or 5 hours to build and although it was long it was really interesting and fun. the ship is very sturdy and has a unique but cool design. The front opens and reveals three seats of which Anakin, Ahsoka, and a littl green blob, can sit. It also has a back door that opens. There is also a button on the top of the ship, that when pressed it closes the door. There is a side door which shows anakins tools and has a place where R2-D2 stands. It also has landing gear that can fold inward during flight. My favorite part of the ship is the escape pod which kinda resembles the bacta tank on the new repulic gunship. Overall this is a great ship and NO stickers! I really dont have any cons so if you have a chance buy it because this set rocks!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-10-13T17:17:08.53Z","the galactic box","This set is pretty much over priced as are all the clone wars sets, which is one reason why i'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5. Another reason, is that the center of the ship contains an empty hole for no reason at all, when it could have been used for storage space or something. But now, on to the pros. The ship has a good stable structure, along with a folding down front hatch to place the characters in, a dropping lower wing by use of a lever, and a back flap which can be lifted up and set in place. The crack in the front of the ship where the character's faces can be seen can be covered if you shift the plank upwards one notch. A good set, but a crummy price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"arctrooper170","2008-12-13T14:20:17.187Z","Amazing!!","For all the complaining about this set most of them are just people who have no taste. The set itself is purely incredible with its opening cockpit and releaseable landing gear and the unique design to drop the bottom wing. I really dislike using things like the winch but it fits in nicely, and the escape pod fits nicely in there to. I do not regret the buying this set and dont mind the cost. I highly recommend this set to advanced builders because this is a pretty tough build. but anyways 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jamal_lts","2008-12-13T04:24:05.483Z","Flying Box","Yes, the design is ugly... But that is what George Lucas intended..

and sadly Lego made it true to its design.

Now what i want to really point out is i didn't pay this set for the design... i have to admit that i was wondering why is it pricey for an &quot;ugly&quot; model...

True enough, in the end...the price was worth it. 

Basically, its 50% Brick and 50% Technic. This set is built using both elements. Its Technic infrastructure gives it a sturdy  solid brick feel. Really is a flying brick.

next, is what this flying brick has in it... &quot;System Portions&quot; which u can implement on your own designs. For Example..

1) The hinged back door. U lift it open, it stays open until u press the top button. and the door unlatches and swings down back
2) The frictioned openable cockpit. Kinda like those hydraulics u find on top of the doors. 
3) The locked landing. when u are about to fly off, just flick that knobed stick and the bottom vertical gun swings down and flips in the landing gear at the same time.
4) The base infrastructure can be use for a Boat or Submarine design.

To sum it up, this thing is worth it so u can study and canibalise/implements its amazing systems.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"JTR_11","2008-11-25T10:47:57.967Z","Big, amazing, UGLY. ","I bought this set from Toys'r'us at only &#163;50 (thats the reason why i bought it). i took a while to build but once it was completed, i thought it was amazing. its big, very sturdy and just a bit ugly. 
so, heres what i gotta say:
Pro's: 
Big
Sturdy
Strong
Good cockpit mechanism
Nice little escape pod

Con's:
Lots of room wasted in the back
Not very steady on rough surfaces (beds, sofa's, them kinda things)
Ugly

thats all i can say really.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Obi_wan_Legobi","2009-01-31T14:47:53.7Z","""Well then, to unexpected gifts."" - Anakin Skywalker (from the Clone Wars series) ","And that's just what this set was for me, an unexpected gift. I thought I was going to get the Attack Gunship, but I'm glad I got this instead. Anyways, on to the set. I really love this set, but it does have a few flaws. Some of them are as follows: the build is LONG and HARD and it hurts your hands from all the technic pieces which is why this only gets a 4, the ship is humungonormiss and it's hard to hold, and there is almost no useable space inside the Twilight except three slivers to hold tools, a rope, R2, the two cockpit seats, and Rotta's booster seat. The good things make this set worth while though. They include the minifigs, an escape pod(with a handle to open it!), landing gear, a handle to open the cockpit, a um ""lever"" to drop the bottom wing, a rope, the huge plank in the back, and a mechanism to hold the back door open and then drop it at the push of a button. If any of you think like I did, that because this is expensive you shouldn't get, you're wrong. I say you should get this set. Your Clone Wars collection just can't be complete without it.

"captain_radda_radda","2009-12-10T23:40:40.623Z","1 Year Later...","Its time for part three of my one year later reviews. Well it may not be the prettiest or the cheapest, but its a damn good set. This set is so underrated in every aspect. The sheer size is huge and looks menacing when unfolded. The gravity activated door works well but gets looser after many uses. Other than that, the set really has stayed on my top shelf and looks great in my room. Best of all, there's actually room to cram in a clone walker to make emergency drops. 

How it stands up to what's out now:
- Certainly big in width
- Not many features
- Not a great price
- A decent selection of figs

Why its a classic
- Although many disagree with me, this set is a classic. It is a staple in the clone wars series and really defines the civilian side of starships which we rarely see. 

Overall:
In some ways I regret getting it because of the room it takes up, but in the end, The Twilight looks great and is as hulking as seen in the show. If you get the chance and have the room, get it, but if not, its really for die hard collectors. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

there is a lot of technic parts and very fun to build (also very painful). here are the pros and cons


pros

-fun to build

-lots of technic parts

-features are great

-comes with rotta (which only is in 2 sets)

cons

-lego could have made it looked better

-the escape pod is dumb

-does not have a medical room like the real one

-overpriced

overall 4/5 

i recommend you to buy it. its a lot more than just a grey ugly box with a wing.

"quin1974","2009-07-26T15:48:40.7Z","Not the prettiest...","This is certainly not the prettiest set there is in the Star Wars galaxy far far away. Its uneven bulk and dull colorscheme aren't exactly easy on the eyes. This is the reason why I waited a long time before buying this set. A serious decrease in price made me buy it none the less, and I am glad I did.

The build was really fun. It took me nearly three hours to build and I am a seasoned builder. A lot of the concepts and techniques are unique to this set and that counts for a lot. The big cockpithatch, the release mechanism for the bottom wing, the hatch at the back. All very faithful to the animated series.

All in all a set worth the reduced price of 80 euros (was 110 euros)and a must for fans of playable Lego-sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
