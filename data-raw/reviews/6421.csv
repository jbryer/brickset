"thepeopleperson","2008-07-26T20:07:41.64Z","Best Value of All the Clone Wars Sets!","I bought this set at TRU today, and it is excellent!  Here are pros and cons.

Pros:
5 Minifigs, including 2 new clone troopers
Commander Fox minifig is very detailed, with many interchangeable accessories.
Comes with extra helmet accessories and an extra blaster
Spider droid is very flexable and can &quot;walk&quot; by moving the legs
Cheapest of the new Clone Wats sets!

Cons:
Should have more pieces for the money

Overall, if you want to buy one of the new Clone Wars sets, this should definately be the one you get first!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2008-07-26T23:41:58.513Z","First Review in a While ","Well, there finally here! The new summer 2008 clone wars sets, and I have one. This set, I guess, is really good. It's a nice, smallish set(that took me 30 miniutes to build), but it isn't perfect. Let's see some pros and cons: 

Pros: 
-awsome minifigures(I love the new clones and their accessories) 
-the guns and leggs are 100% posable 
-model is very sturdy(I mean, you can position the model in any crazy way you want ON A HARD SURFACE and it won't fall over) 

Cons: 
-WAY OVERPRICED! 

I mean, I went to toysrus today and spent like $38(including tax) on this set. It was retailed for $34.99 when should have only been retailed for $19.99. Anyways, I give this set a 4/5; it's a great set, but just too overpriced. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bigz123","2008-07-27T22:07:27.547Z","first clone wars set ive got. and its great.","Alright. firstly this is my first review in about three months. anyway this set is actually the best SW set ive ever gotten. the clones are much detailed then the old ones. droids are same. spider droid.... no words to describe this perfect droid. i am ccerantly making a &quot;Clone Wars&quot; movie and this will be part one. anyway lets just go to the &quot;Pros and Cons&quot;.

Pros-

-nice details with clones.
-beautiful spider droid.
-Commander Fox!
-finaly i have an episode 2 version clone.

Cons-

-over priced but i understand. its because of the stocks.
-legs on spider droid could be a little improved.

improvements i have made.
installed a motor so it walks.

anyway this set is cool. i liked building it and like the clones. have i already said that? i will give this a 4. out of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Cool red clone
A few droids. (as if we don't have enough)

Cons:
WAY overpriced
Unstable
Those ugly blue technic pins...
Doesn't look like a $30 set.

All in all, I wouldn't recommend this set unless you want the red clone.

"Da_LegoBuilder","2008-07-28T13:05:10.42Z","Begun..The clone wars has...","So I opened this set and the pieces came out in the little bags and the instruction booklet was in mint conidtion. The I started making the minifigs. I made commander fox first and i was impressed. He comes with the kama (skirt) pauldron (chest plate) col helmet and other. In the helmet, small holes are there so you can put any acessory that came with this set you want! It came with antenna for fox, binoculars or whatever its called (Commander Cody has it) and normal one to show your rank. It comes with 2 dual D-17 pistols also. AND it come with an extra blaster for him if you don't like the pistols (which I highly doubt). You are just blown away how much they give you for just one minifig. For both of the clones its a face instead of the old black heads. The face looks like a ani clone wars head, just with no hair! The future looked bright for this set.It comes with another regualar clone trooper with a blaster. Comes with battle droid, commander, and super battle droid!

I started to build it, and I could seriously build it by looking at the instruction booklet once. It is mainly a ball with four FLIMSY legs coming out of it. The legs are messed up, if a earthqake magnitude of umm...3 struck your house, it WILL fall down, no question about it. It can't really walk either, and the bottom laser turret doens't rotate. The homing spider droid seems 10x much better on the box, so don't get fooled. It is kinda a good way to build a droid army, for $30!

Here's just a summary of this for people who don't like to read my reviews:

Pros
-Commander Fow w/ LOTS of acesseries
-New clone trooper comes with it, both w/ &quot;ani&quot; heads!
-Commander droid
-super battle droid
-battle droid
(just the minifigs)
-Limited edition!
-Homing spider droid looks kinda cool...

Cons
-Homing spider droid has flimsy legs! how can a big bulky ball of metal stand on 4 flimsy legs!?
-Bottom turrent on the spider droid doesn't rotate
-It can't really walk
-Can't stand correctly and withstand an earthquake (in california earthquakes ahppen frequently!)
-More clones, you can't make a good clone army. If you buy 1 of each set that come with a regualar clone you get 5! thats not an army! Make a battle pack!

Hope this review makes you get this set soon!

"Rgijaba","2008-07-29T10:32:27.937Z","it's about time we got a homing spider droid!","and here it is! this one comes with: a super battle droid, a battle droid, a battle drod commander, a colne trooper, and commander fox. the new ARC trooper gear is great, the command guatlet, DC-15 hand blasters, flood light, ect. it's all here. now the spider droid was a very short build, and the end result looks like it should have taken you longer than 10 minutes. it doesnt realy walk, or at least i couldnt get it to. it also has two blasters: one on its &quot;head&quot; the other on the bottom of his &quot;head&quot;. they rotate, and it looks good towering over your droid army with your MTT. i think its price should be more of $25 rather than $30.
but its still the cheapest of the new clone wars sets (next to hail fire droid and spider droid). if i were you, i'd get this set as it's a great additon to a droid army, battle display, or a collection. but if it's a spider droid, shouldn't it have 8 legs?

"dragon_teenager","2008-08-05T15:41:40.467Z","Some flaws, but overall not bad ","The Spider Droid suffers from a few problems, but it's still a great addition to your Separatist army. 

 PROS :

- At five minifigs, this is a great battle pack

- It's about time we got a Spider Droid

- Fun to use as long-range artillery in battle scenes

- Useable parts

- Looks pretty sweet

- Easy build

 CONS :

- The legs don't work very well

- At ten bucks overpriced, this set is barely worth it, even to collectors

- Not the most movie-accurate model I've everseen

- Won't stand on a soft surface

- I'd rather have another grey SBD rather than two normal BDs

"Buckbrick","2008-08-03T08:48:14.06Z","Nice little droid.","I was as excited as the next guy when they launched the Clone Wars sets. But after looking the prices, this may be the only set I may get, and probably the AT-TE. As expected, at 206 pieces, the built was quick and straightforward. First you build the body, then the 4 legs and finally attach the guns. I agree that the whole thing was wobbly. But that's how you can contort the droid in all sorts of poses. In a nutshell:

Pros:
- The clones! Although you get only 2 clones, there's Commander Fox, which is only available in this set for now. Hence the ridiculous price I guess.
- The spider droid looks great and has good playability.
- As always, the guns in Star Wars sets are detailed and fun to built.

Cons:
- The printing for the new clone minifigs is rather disappointing. The helmet markings are smeared on my clone fig and the red on Commander Fox's is uneven.
- Much too wobbly. More regulated actuation of the legs would have been better.
- Of course the price is unacceptable to a certain degree. But I bet Lego is not going to lower it as far as limited edition sets are concerned. If they do, the sets would have vanished from the shelves and resurface on the net at double the price. If you are considering whether to get it and if you are ok with the price point, I'd say go for it.

I admit the price was the factor that prevented me from grabbing it during its launch - USD29.99 for 206 pcs is overboard.  But beyond that, I love this little droid and looks great with my collection. I guess it's older sets for me for the time being.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LastStand","2008-08-01T02:09:20.013Z","Expensive set.","This is an awesome set with 5 minifigures. I especially loved the clones. The droid is basically a ball with 4 legs attached to it. Building is not too difficult. in fact, it only took me less than 30 minutes to construct this. Also, I love the new clone commander. He has so many pieces/parts on him. Its just awesome. I just wish they would of have included more clone troopers. This is suppose to be an awesome set but several factors lowered its rating.  i think the price should be $26.99 CAD judging the size of the box and the pieces count.

First is the &quot;hard to find/limited edition&quot;. Why did lego made it hard to find?? Its only exclusive to Toysrus which makes it so expensive and more demanding.
Also, for a 200 pieces set, i don't think its worth $40 CAD. If your looking for a great buy, this is not for you. Its a really expensive set. I would recommend the hailfire droid/spider droid cause its half the price of this set with 249 pieces. $19.99 USD


Overall great set. I hope they lower the price later and not make it a limited edition. Afterall, its just a label printed on it and exclusive to some stores which makes it so much more expensive. I'm more interested in the set rather than the limted edition label on the box.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"yodaccm","2008-09-13T16:52:51.733Z","Not really worth the price...","I only got this set for the Commander Fox minifig to compliment the other clone commanders from the other &quot;Clone Wars&quot; sets.  Overall, it's not a bad set, but at $30 and only 206 pieces, you have to wonder if it is really worth it.  The main attraction is the spider droid.  It has two laser cannons, top and bottom mounted.  The top swivels almost a full 360 degrees, which is good.   The bottom can only move up and down, but in actuality, it really only moves down, they back to it's original position, which is ok, but the angle at which the cannon moves down, it would be shooting the ground in front of it.  I wonder why the designers couldn't have made it swivel like the top?  My other main gripe about this set is the legs on the droid are rather unstable.  The only way for the droid to stand correctly, is to have the legs fully extended, equally on all sides.  It's possible to do, but have the legs in any other position, and your droid spider may keel over.  Also, the feet  are a little gangly and tend to flip up when trying to make the droid &quot;walk.&quot;  Comes with Commander Fox, Clone trooper, Droid commander, battle droid and Super Battle Droid.

Pros:

Nice number of minifgs
Commander Fox fig, with many different accessories to customize you clone troopers
Decent addition to your Separatist droid army

Few interesting features

"tahu2008","2008-10-06T17:06:15.5Z","Spider Droid","I bought this set a month ago and I am still very pleased with it.  I comes with an amount of minifigs usually found only in battle packs and 100$ + sets.  the new ARC troopers are really cool and they make your clone armies more realistic.  The droids come with new arms that allow them to hold the new type of blasters.  The spider droid it self is quite realistic, with a rotating gun on the top and a gun that goes up and down on the bottom. The eye moves up and down, and the legs slide enabling it to walk.  This can sometimes be a little annoying, because the legs slide toward the middle and ruin your nice little scene.  This is a bit pricy, as you can get the claw tank for the same price.

first i wasnt sure if i wanted to buy this set or not, and i'm glad i did, it comes with a great amount of mini figures for the price, inclueding the exclusive comander fox, who is absalutely awsome, and the rare droid comander, plus a clone, droid and super. now the main set. it is basicly a round(ish) ball with four legs sticking out the sides. the legs are completely loose, so it slides around if its not on carpet or studs. despide how much it wobbles its almost imposible to knock over. the guns both look great, the bottom shoots a reapeating anti-personel laser, while the top shoots a high powerd beam(kinda weird because the stronger laser has a smaller dish). the top gun rotaits, and the bottom one moves up and down. this set isnt that detailed, i mean its pretty plain with skinny legs. compared to the movies this is about 2/3 of the propper hight, but still is closer to scale than the hailfire. 


playability- 2/5 not much to do doesnt walk that well and *gasp* no flick fire missles

the head has no driver. i hate it when they make cockpit-less vehicles and call them ""droid fighters"". i know its in the movie but its annoying. 

5 figures is a lot, but are all useful? 2 battle droids and a super battle droid would seem good if you dont own the droid battle pack or any battle droids. the clones are ok, i mean they have faces now which is good except there just so ugly. they look like exo force heads but peach.

the main problem is that there is no place to pt the guys. the droid is very small for 30 dollars and the figures are sub-average.

It was a rainy Saturday afternoon,my dad was going to go pick up something,I went with him,the place we were going was close to a Toys""R""us inside a mall,so after my dad got the thing,we went to the Toys""R""us.When we went in,it was a strange place.My sister went to go look at the webkinz,while I looked at Lego.I went and looked in the Lego Isle,I looked,and the set(s) I was looking for weren't there,but i saw some other Lego set's,and the one of the one's I was looking for was there(This set).So I went to the Checkout,and my dad bought it(I was going to pay him back when I got home),and i watched.

So I got home,opened the box,and to my surprise,one of the bags had a rip in it,AND THE MINIFIGS WERE MISSING!.A couple days later,my dad phoned Lego,after the call my dad said that the first person who bought it,probably carefully opened the box(The box had tapes) ripped the bag,took the minifigs out,then carefully sealed it back up again with the same tapes,took it back to the store,and go a refund.

So my dad took it back to the store, the lady there put a sticker and told us to go get another one.We brought back another one,and we looked at the box carefully,the we opened it,and to our surprise,the minifigs were missing,and there was a bag from the V-19 torrent,we weren't to go get another one,but that was the last one,so we got a refund,and weren't back home.

Once built it is not a very fun to play with, and as I've said looks much better set up in a battle. The legs are weak and a bit flimsy, and the whole thing is quite difficult to pose. Also the head isn't very accurate, and would be much better as a single piece sphere.

I was excited and couldn't wait for a&nbsp;Commander Fox and a cool set. My hopes were fulfilled, until I realized when writing this review, this **** stinks.&nbsp;Lets get on with the box and such. Its normal, the box has some good artwork. The instruction were good too. The set, however, is mediocre. The Spider Droid&nbsp;suffers from loose turrets and an awful leg design. I think this takes the place for the worst leg design,&nbsp;even beating&nbsp;the AT-ST from the Endor Bunker. The figures are the only shining light from this set. The clone is nice, and it includes&nbsp;a nice amount of droids, but, the best of all is Commander Fox. I have said in countless statements that the original EP.2 troopers were the best clones ever. This Minifigure, standing at about 1 inch, is the best clone, dare I say it, Minifigure ever. His detail is amazing, his helmet is fantastic. Now, for a 20 dollar set with a mediocre droid and good Minifigures, this is above average, oh wait. I was just kidding, this set isn't 20 dollars, its 35 dollars.....35 Mother ****ing dollars. Why would you cost that much for a set? I could go out and buy a brand new DS game or a pre-owned Halo Reach for that much. Hell, even a vintage NES Contra game would go for less.
