"Gus_263","2008-05-23T17:55:07.2Z","This set may be small, but could be better","This is a little set from mars mission, small like sets from this theme, castle and now city, also know as impulse sets. This is the &quot;impulse&quot; mars mission set with more pieces, some useful, but could be better in the building. The description of the set says that this have fire power. This don't have, only glowing blue pieces to makes that this set looks like shot something. But still, maybe with the contents they could make a system to throw flick missiles, or just they could make a cockpit for the pilot. A thing that frustrates the set is the repeated color scheme, of the past year, and maybe this can be continued to the next year. The minifigures of the astronauts from mars mission are all the same, except their faces (but many faces are repeated on this and in the castle theme, none are the original lego face or classic ones), and can be considered an army of clones. What happened to the different details or the same with different colors, that were putted on old subthemes like UFO? But still, repeating the astronauts' bodies and details.

The building of the wings on the vehicle aren't very solid, they are good, also connected to the main part of the vehicle by claw pieces, but you need be cautious to play with the wings (don't the main part, this is solid, but with the wings). The white plates are well positioned and connected with orange ones. The helmet of the minifigure is the same of racers (the new sets from racers don't have minifigures), but could be from the old Ice Planet 2002. The blue pieces on the front are good positioned with long white sticks. The playability is the same of the small space ships, and the buillding (altough without a cockpit or without shots, that this set could have) still better than another mars mission set named alien jet, because the human minifigure (altough with the repeated details and colors) have the original lego shape. Altough this have it's pros and cons, the fact that this is the &quot;impulse&quot; mars mission set with more pieces than other, makes this in overall deserves a 8/10 rate.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Legoman1993","2008-09-10T08:59:47.543Z","Nice addition to any collection!","This is a great little set to build your mars mission army!  
  This little space ship can protect your recon drop ship or any other mars mission ship!You can also get a astronaut mini figure{with a new face design} for a cheap price instead of spenting $30.00 and only getting one! {claw tank ,etx alein strike ,trike,}those sets have only one mini figure!If you want to use it for pieces then you can add some of the pieces to your spaceships to make it look sharper!:)If you want an army of astros buy this set 3 times or so!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-03-25T20:08:01.373Z","Lame Spacecraft","Mars Mission was an OK theme, but sets like this really brought down the theme to its doom. The spacecraft is just a pile of pieces put together. The minifigure would be useful if you never had it. Besides that, this set is pathetic.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-29T12:29:04.717Z","We exterminate extraterrestrials!","If you look at the spacecraft and its driver they look like they're the &quot;brave&quot; front-liners sent to wipe out the entire alien civilization. But actually there is a gag behind it, if you lift up the helmet the guy's face is the 'scared-to-death mouth-opening-wide' face. Anyways, the spacecraft design was limited to 26 pieces so we could all afford one of this so I am not complaining much. But I agree with Gus263 about the 'firepower' part. There is certainly no fire involved in creating, building and playing with this set. (I know, pun intended). All in all, this is another of those 'build-your-army' sets and great to buy when you're on a tight budget.

"BionicFlamer","2009-02-02T17:51:35.373Z","Not bad","I once got the crystal hawk when i was bored and had $5.00 and decided to buy it but it's not such a bad set. I you have all the big mars mission sets then buying this crystal hawk can help the astronauts increase its army against the aliens and the small crystal hawk is fast and tricky because it could dodge through lasers and missiles really quick and can be spotted not easily. Speaking in imagination, this crystal hawk can be like a spy plane to sneak up on aliens and follow them to their base and fly quick and shoot blue lasers to kill most of the base and aliens. It's cool but size doesn't matter unless it is great for imagination.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-22T17:36:30.5Z","tiny little thing","Yes, I gave it a three. But it is good for a mini.The wings, however, are floppy. The driver's seat is also a little awkward with the minifig sitting upright. The cannons are fine and kinda fill in the gap between the wings.
I have to give it a three. It isn't the greatest, but it's good for a mini. Still, not the best. It does hold together well, but the color scheme is terrible. I'd wait on getting this.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-27T17:15:09.043Z","Good Little Spacecraft","This set looks like it was pretty much designed after the astro fighter, except smaller. The main base is partially modified from the astro fighter, but the wings are almost identical in design. The cannons looked a little big for it at first, but now, I like it.

pros:
Dual-sided minifigure head.
Base is almost original.
Fun to play with.
Good-looking cannons.
Can fit on the back of the Hypersonic Spacecraft.

cons:
Wings are almost non-original.

This is a fun set to play with. If you are concerned about the design, get something else.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Dragon_Master_48","2012-05-24T16:30:17.47Z","A Rather Good Set, But...","<p><strong>5619 Crystal Hawk</strong> is a nice little addition to the wonderful Mars Mission line. However, although it can be rebuilt into a countless number of things (including outposts, barracks, turrets/defense stations, and power generators), it is rather small by itself, limiting its possibility.</p>
