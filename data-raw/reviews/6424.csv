"tomahawker","2008-05-23T21:15:15.17Z","Don’t Fear the Reaper","The first wave of Mars Mission sets were maligned by many, but if this set is any indication, the second wave is a dramatic improvement.

Pros:
Cool model with many functions
Easily converted to a motorized remote control by adding Power Functions accessories
New Alien Commander fig with separate arms and legs
New “flexure” launched flick fire missiles
Modular building process
Great parts selection, including 6 total figures

Cons:
A few too many stickers and no pre-printed parts
&quot;Flex fire&quot; feature is weak


Detailed Review:

The build is broken down into 4 steps, each with a separate bag of parts.  I personally prefer this, as it makes finding parts much easier in a set of this size.

Step 1 is the assembly of the mini-figs, the small rover, and the alien spaceship.  The astronaut figs are the standard MM figs, with nicely detailed torsos and gold visors.  There are two 2-piece “standard” aliens, and the Alien commander fig.  The alien commander has a large torso and combined head.  It’s made of an interesting combination of black and trans green that’s molded in one piece.  The arms and legs are trans green and reminiscent of exo-force robots parts.  The only knock on this figure is the hollow nature of the torso, which looks odd from behind.  However, this allows a 1x1 trans neon green to be placed in his head, creating an effect similar to the glowing eyes in a Bionicle figure.

The rover is a simple 4-wheeled vehicle with a hinged dump bed in the rear.  The vehicle is in the standard white and trans-orange MM color scheme, and is completed with a couple of mini-fig accessories.

The alien ship is the standard black and neon green, apparently powered by a trans neon jewel in the nose of the ship.  In another twist to the weird MM aliens, the alien commander is clipped into the cockpit through a hole in his chest!  A couple of clip hinge wings can be adjusted to various angles, and the ship is completed with holo-foil stickers on the fairings and wings.

Step 2 is the assembly of the astronaut spaceship.  It’s a nice model with a rounded design afforded by the use of the curved passenger plane fuselage piece, which has an opening to view the Martian crystal powered engine.  The ship has a couple of ducted fan-blade repulsor lifts, and two grabber claws constructed with jointed fingers.  A dual cannon is mounted on a ball joint.  In addition, a new piece that uses a plastic flexure to flick a thin rod is attached to the cannon.  However, the “flex-fire” force is pretty anemic.  The spaceship mounts to the tank base by sliding over a technic cross axle.

The third and fourth steps are the assembly of the tank base.  The base consists of twin black tank treads (the heavy duty pieces as seen in the Technic bulldozer).  Attached to the tank treads are two sets of cutters and a pair of scoops (made from Bionicle pieces) that rotate when the tank moves, performing something like a combine harvester.  In the center of the tank is a crystal powered engine, and some kind of bizarre alien holding chamber, complete with a hose hooked to an alien’s chest and what looks like a life support system.  The rear of the tank has a loading ramp that allows the rover to roll on and off the tank base.  However, one of the coolest features of the tank is that it can be motorized and controlled remotely with the addition of a battery box, two power functions mini motors, and a PF infrared receiver.  These are easily installed (although the rover ramp must be removed to allow room for the motors and battery box), and once in place allow the reaper to be driven remotely like a real tank.

In summary, this is a very cool model with lots of functionality, and the remote control capability is the icing on the cake.  I give it a 5 out of 5.

I just got a couple of days ago and the building experience was really fun and the playability with it is endless.

It also includes a brand new alien commander that's nice because he's differt than the other aliens and he can actually move his legs and arms. The only problem with him is that he is a little too big and can't fit into other alien space ships.

It came with a lot of features. One of  them is when you push the tank forward the saws at the front of it will move along with it. You can also store a little mining rover in the back perfectly and take it out and put it in with no problem. Plus the top part of the mobile tank can come off and act as a human space ship. 

I think the coolest feature is you can add power functions to it! (But sadly they don't come with the set.) They let you detatch the space ship and also move the mobile tank on it's own if you attatch a function to the wheel.

I highly recomend this set to anyone who is into the Lego Mars Mission series or just loves messing around with power functions on  lego creations!

"Imperial13","2008-07-24T18:36:32.247Z","Oh my.","      Okay, starting off this review I will say buying the $40+ worth of power functions is totally worth it. It is one of the many ways to expand your LEGO system and overall make your experiance with this set more enjoyable. Trust me. Other than that it is really probably one of the few Mars Mission sets that is worth your money and time.
   
   The alien ship: Quite the vehicle, as it has everything you could ask for out of it, even though it uses the same style as every single other alien ship in this series. It seems LEGO is still clipping the aliens into the ships, even the commander. The stickers are what make this small craft stand out, and as said in another review that the leftovers will provide useful for customs, with there shiny metallic surface. While it's not exactly &quot;the best&quot;, it sure brings out the set (kinda), and allows the play value go up a little. 
   
   The Buggy: Okay, this will not win &quot;Best Deployable Craft of the Year Award&quot;, it goes in fine with the the Reaper, but I think this set could do without it. It's little tipper function is kinda cute, and again, allows something for the kids to play with.

   The Figs: Okay, there is two much figs in this set. I would prefer to have only the Alien Commander and one alien, and only two astronauts (Get it, &quot;two much&quot;). The astronauts are the same we usually get, and the Alien Commander isn't that great, after all, he has legs for hands! Moving on now.

   The Reaper: You know the title of this review? It was directed at the Reaper. This thing pretty much takes up a whole book, and it ends up being really, really large. I will start with the amazing detachable ship/cockpit, a.k.a my favorite part of this set. The ship itself is pretty much the largest play feature of the set. It has a lab, insanely bad flick fire missiles, which is a real downer, as I was starting to like those other ones. It also has a pretty well designed cockpit, with arms to grab hostile aliens, which is quite cool. It might need some more lasers though, as the ones on those beautiful folding wings located on the rear of the Ship just don't do it. Now we will have a talk about the lab located on the Reapers main body. It is, in a way, disturbing. LEGO instructs you to put a pump into the aliens chest, which is connected to some pump looking thing. There is also some laser guns, along with all those other space gadgets. Also located near this are is the spinning scooper/blades, which are directly hooked up to the treads, allowing each one to move independently, allowing the the Power Functions to work better.  Overall, one of the best ships I've bought from LEGO.

  Power Functions: Very impressive, I absolutely love them! Shame it would have been to expensive to include them with this set. It zips along very fast, definetly worth the price. Not the time, as it takes about 2 minutes to set it all up. Adding these functions forces you to get rid of the buggy loading device.

Overall: 10/10
Minifigs: 6/10
Alien Craft: 8/10
Buggy: 5/10
Reaper: 10/10
Power Functions:9/10

Last Remarks: A good set for your money, although I'd like to see a little less technic (about 1/3 of the Reaper is composed of it) and a little more system. Highly recomended, especially if you own the Technic BullDozer or the Monster Dino. My best purchase this year.

"Captain","2008-07-17T09:06:12.153Z","Exellent set, worth the money, but it has flaws.","Put simply, this set is awesome. It comes with an abundance of great pieces, most obviously the giant tracks for the main model, and a unique missile launcher. I'll break up the review into chunks for ease of reading.

The Reaper: The main part of this set is the giant tracked vehicle with spinning blades and a detachable spaceship. It's awesome! There's a small lab in the back and a place to store a rover, along with some guns for the astronauts. The missile launcher is a bit inconsistent, but usually works well. There are a few things I don't like about it, however. 1: there are stickers. Stickers are just so annoying to apply and they don't even look that good. I recommend only putting them on the control panels. 2: The detachable spaceship is held on by one technic rod. Even when it's all the way on, there is still a gap between the tower it clips onto and the coupler on the ship, with the tiny axle in between the two. I recommend putting two of those narrow technic wheels (with the 6 holes arounf the center) and put them on the axle that connects the two parts of the vehicle. Push them all the way down, and it should be less wobbly when you attach the craft.


The Rover: Nothing special here. Just a basic rover with a dumping bucket. It's got a cute build I guess, and it comes with another orange windshield.


The Alien Ship: This model is the only one I bothered applying all of the stickers to. That's because the stickers own, they're super shiny and awesome. These stickers were worth the effort. The ship itself is a small fighter piloted by the Alien Commander dude. The commander is strange, the pieces used for his arms and legs are the same, only flipped around, and his head is kind of big. The ship has a nice build, with adjustable wings and spears. I also like the bubble with the energy crystal inside. The ship also has missiles, but no laser cannons to be seen. The one thing that I don't like about this ship is that it looks ugly without the pilot in it. He completes the look of the craft.


So overall, this set is pretty much awesome. With a bit of modification to the coupler system, it's almost perfect. So if you're thinking of buying it, go ahead, you won't be disappointed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"LEGOSystemFREAK","2008-12-05T17:33:38.093Z","HUGE improvement over the clawtank","As you all know,the Crystal Reaper is basically the brother of the clawtank,as they both have arms and they both have threads.Now lets get to the review now,Shall we?

ETX Alien Booster: Very nice. Flickfire missles are basically a revolution over imaginary missles. Alien commander is nice,but the head still cannot be moved. Shame.

MT-11 Crystal Dumper: Ok. First,this is almost identical to the Rover found in ETX Alien Strike,But this time with a dumper. Not much to say.

MT-61 Crystal reaper: MASSIVE!
The engine is pretty good,you can also take an Astro out without removing pieces to make him mine. The Cockpit can detach and scout.

POWER FUNCTIONS:
Its fast! Note: You can hook up the Crystal reaper with Power functions,but then you cant detach the cockpit or store the MT-11. Anyways,its VERY fast with power functions.

This set is worth it.Definetely.

"Sobel","2015-02-20T17:49:22.923Z","Must be the coolest set of Mars Mission!","<p>The caption says it all: This set is <strong>REALLY</strong> cool!</p>

<p>This massive track vehicle features three astronauts, two green aliens and one alien commander. The build is manageable, even if you were an unexperienced LEGO builder.<br />
The lower part of the vehicle consists of the large chain tracks, a small laboratory to research the aliens and a bay for a smaller transport vehicle. The upper part is a detachable spacecraft with a small research area and two large claws. What I especially like about this model is the <strong>details</strong>. There are a lot of possibilities for the crew to work or do research! Great playability!</p>

<p>The small transport vehicle has a cargo area, but nothing more special about it. There is also an alien ship in this set, but this one is quite simple. At least, it also contains an alien commander, even though it would also be suicide to attack the Reaper with this puny ship...</p>

<p>The MT-61 is armed with a small, operating<strong> rocket launcher</strong>. It works by pulling and releasing a small lever, which shoots the rocket out of its holder. Neat!<br />
It also has a (not operating) dual Railgun which looks very impressive!</p>

<p>Another bonus to this set is, that you can combine it with a LEGO Technic <strong>Power Functions</strong> set and a Technic Remote Control! In fact, you can make it a fully operating track vehicle to drive around your room!! Now if that isn&#39;t cool?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Everything fits with this model. Build, playability, parts, all is fine! It looks super cool, has a lot of details and functions and can even be turned into a remote operated vehicle!! 5 Stars!!</p>
