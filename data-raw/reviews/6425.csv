Human miner:
This is ok, I guess. Having the humanoid robot is a first! I like the little ship that attaches on to the back of the walker! The little robot that comes with it looks like Wall E, as other people have said, but it is a good addition to the set! Another miner for my collection! However, I hate the swivel legs!

Alien ship:
Awesome! I couldn't find anything to complain about! It is probably the best alien ship so far. It can transform between a walker and the ship, whcih is easy to do and cool to look at!

"kris","2009-02-21T07:14:35.013Z","Quality set, nice price.","I picked this up fron S@H for £13, cheap, but I was actually intending to pick this up at full price anyway, so it was an added bonus, and 333 parts for £20 works out at quite a nice price per parts ratio.

Included are 4 minifigs: 2 astronauts, 1 martian and 1 martian commander, who is pretty nice - he's a large, imposing minifig with arms!, also included is a small brick built robot and what I assume to be a martian probe.

The astronauts have a reasonably cool drilling robotic suit, which a very diminutive winged craft attaches to, the crystal detecting device is a nice touch on the suit, it seems Lego has gone the extra mile to create added playability in this set.

The infiltrator itself is large, impressive and bristling with weaponry. Its also worth noting this years martian sets sticker sheets have a nicely rainbow reflective quality, kind of like the rainbow reflections of a compact disc, this adds to the overall classiness of the finished model.

PRO's

• Excellent brick to cost ratio
• 4 minifigures including Martian Commander
• Large and sleek main spaceship
• Generous extra's for the astronauts

CON's

• Firing mechanism on the infiltrator is poor
• slight droop to the front of Infiltrator when nose is up, although its barely noticeable
• Infiltrators walker mode is fairly poor

Overall, I totally recommend this set to any Mars Mission/Space fan and in my view the best of the 2008 Mars Mission line up, so a well deserved 5 from me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ovid07","2009-02-27T15:55:27.047Z","Best Mars Mission Alien ship!","Intro
This set really surprised me.  I originally got it along with set # 7645, the crystal reaper, because I wanted an alien spaceship and was drawn in by the cool human robot.  When I got the set what really struck me was alien space craft.  It's sleek design, large cockpit, and size continue to impress me today.
Design
As I've already mentioned, the alien spacecraft has a very eye pleasing design.  Even though I usually dislike large pieces, here they look great.  The cockpit design is also really nice overall, as it can hold the commander and a normal alien.  The technic pieces used to design the top of part of it are cool also, as they complement the sharp edges well.  Finally, I really want to comment on the small details that add to the space craft such as the lime green 1x1 wedge shaped pieces on the wings, and the SNOT (studs not on top) used to hold the sides of the cockpit on.

The human walker really disappointed me for a number of reasons.  First, the legs are attached to the body by turnable pieces so they are always turning.  This makes it very hard and annoying for the robot to stand up.  Second, the arms of the robot are just horrible.  This was clearly the wrong time to use technic pieces as not only do they look weird, but they also sag as the joints get loose after some time.  Finally, while the ""jet pack with wings"" may look cool from the front, when the robot is looked at from the side it seems to extend out to far.  The robot is still OK overall, but isn't quite as good as it looks in the pictures.

Colors
I really like the choice made in the Mars Mission theme to make the alien colors black and lime green.  It works well creating both ""sick"" and ""otherworldly"" feelings. Red seems to be a ""highlighting"" color for the aliens and this helps reinforce these feelings.

Like all the other astronaut vehicles the orange and white color scheme works well here too.  To contrast the aliens it seems to create ""clean"" and ""futuristic"" feelings.  The blue highlights also help reinforce these feelings.

I really want to comment on the stickers because usually, Lego fans HATE all most all stickers on sets.  But in this case the holographic stickers are actually awesome!  They shimmer in the light and are almost as cool as sound features in some of the older space sets.

Features

The alien ship's main feature, its ability to turn into a walker, is really a lousy gimmick.  I could go on complaining about this but because I want to keep this review as short as possible, and many others have done the same in their reviews, I won't.  The alien ship also features a cool little scout which comes off the back!


The only feature the human robot has is the ""jet pack"", which can turn into a mini flying vehicle.  This hard to describe, but the two side pieces fold around to the front, and then it came snap off the back of the robot.  Pretty cool!

Overall

This is a very good set, and in my opinion has the best alien spaceship of all the Mars Mission sets.

"lavalizard78","2009-04-19T01:14:46.763Z","Very good set","I give this set a 4/5 because of the numerous little defects. But, the main features perform well, and will not disappoint you. The ship is superb. It is completely perfect for showing off as well as having a battle. The ""walker"" mode is a little off from what I had expected, but not in a bad way. If you put enough time into it, you can really make it walk! As for the only bad things about it, the green bars fall off a little to easy, the missiles on the right are hard to pick out of the slot, and the picture is inaccurate. On each missile, there is no green stud on it. The missiles are just bars. The missiles, however, do actually shoot! Other than that, a perfect set for anyone to get, build, and marvel at.

 This set also comes with a number of little robots. There's the famous ""WALL-E"", a martian probe or drone, and an astronaut with a drill.

 And, as for the walker or mining suit, it's rather disappointing. The legs are on basic swivel joints and don't move up and down, just left and right. It does contain a cool transforming mini-jet on it's back, though. A pick-ax, and a blaster are however included on it's legs. The crystal detecter on the left arm tends to strain a little high off the ground due to the rubber tubing.

OVERALL-------4/5----worth buying-----recommended for purchase---and a great value for piece-to-price ratio. I'm telling you, if your deciding between this set and another set, get this one!  Please trust me that you should get this set.  You will never regret it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Infiltrator

Pros.

Transforming feature
attack jet in back that detatches
flex-fire missles
can seat commander and normal alien in cockpit
has many guns

Cons.

Transforming is slow compared to switch fighter
front sags lie other have said, but that's how those pieces are, so i don't really care too much
sort of hard to get pilots into cockpit
flex-fire is weak unless pulled back all the way
transforming is odd in the sense that the ship can only use the red guns in front of the cockpit when in ground mode(which is pretty dumb)

Driller

Pros.

Nice drill
crystal detector
good cockpit
pack on the bak is a flyer for the extra astronaut

Cons.

Legs are attached to the body with swivel bricks. Lego did this to attach the legs to the body but with some sort of articulation.

"Colonel14","2011-01-21T16:33:05.317Z","Beware the Identified Flying Object!","<p>After getting the very small and awful Crystal Hawk, I needed another Mars Mission set. I wanted another set from the series that could show me that Mars Mission was good. The <strong>ETX Alien&nbsp;Infiltraitor</strong>&nbsp;has more than made up for the Hawk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Build</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two things in the set you must build: the main vehicle, and a small astronaut crystal miner. The ETX's build is interesting and uses some nice parts. The build is seperated into four parts (building the front, cockpit, and the two wings). There are plenty of alien-like stickers that go well with the lime green and black color scheme of the vessel. The cockpit has room for two minifigures, and the cover over it can come off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The small mining mech is pretty nice. However, the legs don't move and just spin on black spinner pieces (don't know the name for them). The cockpit is shaped like a dome, and the cockpit shield is a rare trans-orange dome. A small plane is on the back of the mech, but causes the vehicle to fall over often. It's arms bend and one has a drill, the other a metal detector piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ETX has the ability to transform into a walker, and is the ship's main feature. Bend the front of the ship and the wings to turn it into a walker. It cannot move, however. There is also a functional launcher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Parts</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set comes with some interesting parts. There are two half-cricle corner pieces, four wing pieces, and two long wing pieces. There's also plenty of trans-red cylinders, four cannon pieces, a launcher piece,&nbsp;a lot of lime green mini slopes, four trans-blue cones, an orange cord, an orange dome, a drill piece, and a metal detector. Two&nbsp;lime green fangs make up the cokpit shield on the ETX. Along with most Mars Mission sets are a couple of crystals, and this set has a few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;four minifigures that come with the set, two astronauts, an Alien Commander, and an Alien. One of the astronauts has a dual-sided head, one half-smiling, the other scared. They have white helmets with small gold visors. The Alien Commander is pretty cool, and I'd rather have two of them instead of the poorly designed Alien. The Alien has little movement, only the leg piece (not just the legs, just the piece) can bend forward and backward (like a Star Wars Battle Droid's legs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Playability</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Infiltrator is very shwooshable (meaning it's easy to pretend it's a plane and fly it around). The walker can't bend it's legs, but it's easy to pretend it's walking becuase of how they turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Overall/Value for Money</em></p>

<p>The ship is very well designed and the set comes with plenty of nice parts for MOCing. Get it for the set or the parts.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"Sobel","2020-06-28T21:32:48.057Z","Impressive alien fighter with an almost even better secondary model!","<p>After having finished my first complete series review (check them out, if you like), I have made it some sort of a good routine for myself to review some sets of my collection in my free time. And with that and my deep passion for LEGO Space, I&#39;ll go on to review this space-themed series from the late 2000&#39;s.<br />
This set is one of the few sets in this series, that I can fully get behind. It has everything: the looks, the functions, the versatility. And it was the first set for me, where the secondary piece was almost more convincing than the actual model.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Many large black parts make up the alien fighter. These can be used nicely in MOCs for hull design and shaping something like a&nbsp;jet or a starship. There are also many black blaster guns, like they come to use in many Star Wars sets. Also worth mentioning are&nbsp;a simple bounce-back shooting mechanism&nbsp;and the multi-directional moving joints. Adding to this, there&#39;s a medium-sized drill head, an orange dome-shaped cockpit glass and four energy crystals. Once again, this set has an abundance of stickers, eighteen in total. This REALLY is a lot and can be a little annoying</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are four minifigures included in this set: two astronauts, an alien and an alien commander. The astronauts have the usual, detailed printed space suits and some gear, including a large power saw and a small blaster.<br />
The alien is useless as ever, but the alien commander is an interesting thing. It consists of a large torso and head (all with glowing eyes via a 1x1 transparent round brick), the design of which gave me some Bionicle vibes... LEGO shows interesting ways of recycling parts here, since the arms and legs of the commander are exactly the same parts! He has the same hole in his chest as the standard aliens, so he can be fixed to a hold via a stick with holder</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Even though the fighter reaches quite a good size when finished, the build is really not that difficult, yet a little repetitive. The wings are identical, only differing in their equipment. There are not really any TECHNIC parts supporting the structure, it&#39;s just brick on brick, same goes for the small mining robot. There is an interesting part, where the cockpit of the robot is built, nothing difficult, but interesting. Again, the many, many stickers are a little annoying...</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Alien Infiltrator is an impressive air supremacy fighter craft. When in flight mode, is has no less than eight forward facing heavy blaster guns and one flip-torpedo-like shooter (that hardly ever works). The cockpit has room for an alien pilot and the commander, who has an own control panel. It is secured by two large green bars, which can be opened forward. Behind the cockpit, what seems to be a small, drone-like aircraft is attached. The wings can be moved quite freely and brought into various attack positions. The very stream-lined ship can be transformed to a ground vehicle by flipping the wings and folding down the large front part. That way, it stands upright at around 20 centimeters.<br />
The small mining robot has a rudimentary walking function achieved by two turn plates above the legs, the latter also holding some gear. The two moveable arms hold a ground scanner and a drill head. The torso has two forward facing blasters in the front and a lot of additional stuff in the back. A small robot can be attached there as well as a light aircraft. This vessel is completely foldable for minimal usage of space. The dome-shaped cockpit offers 360&deg; sight, unfortunately it has once again no visible controls.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As one will probably find out while reading my reviews to this series, most of the models have several serious flaws in my eyes and could not reach their full potential. This one here is an exception. Almost everything works with this two-model set: the design is nice, aggressive and intimidating with the alien fighter and sturdy, compact and practical with the mining robot. The functions are neat, the wing movement and transformation with the fighter and the versatility and detachable modules of the miner. Also, the introduction of another minifgure (alien commander) is a good idea, since the standard aliens are so ugly and useless.&nbsp;<br />
One more word on the mining mech: This thing impressed me far more than I would have imagined. Being only the secondary model in the set, it features so many functions and gear and possibilities of playing! The detachable aircraft in the back is so awesome! I mean, look at the mech, it is so small! And then it has an even smaller vehicle as a backpack so that the second astronaut can also go on a flight! And the aircraft is folded up like a baby buggy for optimal storage! Incredible! And that tiny lil&#39; robot! Even cuter than BB-8!<br />
Are there negative points? Sure, nothing is ever perfect. As mentioned before, the mech has no controls in the cockpit. The transformed version of the fighter is good for... what? It surely is no walker, maybe some kind of huge sniper-like cannon for long distance precision shots... The shooting mechanism does not really work that good.<br />
But these few negative points REALLY could not weigh in so heavily for me to subtract from the many, many cool positive features of the set. It&#39;s an absolutely awesome space set and an outstanding part of this sometimes so-so&nbsp;series.</p>
