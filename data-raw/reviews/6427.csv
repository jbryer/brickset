"mww","2008-07-07T07:11:27.903Z","Many cool bricks","After having returned to LEGO after 15 years with the GTB Fiorano (8145) and the Snowmobile (8272), I find the Excavator to be an excellent set:
It has 60 of the new treads -- making it the best set to get those (8294 has 60 for EUR50, 8272 has 28 for EUR30, 8275 has 84 for EUR130).
It has the new linear actuators, which are an interesting replacement for pneumatics -- not quite as cool but easier to motorize.

Building the excavator is very good, the only drawback being the repetitive build of the two tread carriers (which are symmetric). This requires you to build 4 identical parts for the carriage. The excavator is very robust thanks to studless building.
I don't have any PF, but there are instructions included how to integrate a normal PF motor and the battery box, for which there is exactly the right amount of space in the carriage -- unfortunately not for the NXT :(

Another interesting thing is a control mechanism for which actuator to move when turning the control gear at the back of the vehicle. It is a very specialized part (actually two); for people who are keen on something like this, this might be a plus -- I personally dislike highly specialized parts like that as they make you depend on their &quot;survival&quot; in your LEGO stash if you want to rebuild the excavator in some years. Another pro/contra -- depending on your preferences -- is that this control mechanism allows/requires only one motor for PF integration. Pro: You only need one motor -- Contra: You cannot fully remote control it.

After all an excellent technic set, especially if you like the new treads (which I do), studless building and the new linear actuators.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Wiseman_2","2008-09-03T06:45:08.717Z","I eagerly await the B-model...","Normally, I will only review a set if I've built both models. Unfortunatly, Lego have made the wierd decision to make you download the instructions for the B-model, and they haven't been made available online yet (as far as I am aware). This can't really be a cost cutting decision because they include a few pieces exclusivly for the B-model. Strange.

As such, this review takes into account only the A-model. The score is only for the A-model.
Anyway, on with the review.

I personally love Lego's excavators, even though I've only been able to posess the two they've made recently (the other being the Yellow one from 2005).
This one's the biggest yet, and is visually amazing. It is big - much bigger than I anticipated. The red colour scheme is something different for Lego - I think this is the first red construction vehicle I've seen (though I would have prefered orange).

The new Linear actuators make it look that bit more realistic. They can be extended one at a time from the gear on the back, and there is a switch to select which you want to extend. This is a very good system that, when set up properly (unlike my first attempt) works fine. It does take some turning though - it's much slower than their previous excavator, which utilised a unique mechanical system.
I suspect it would be easier with the motor.

The scoop moves as one with the front part. It can easily be altered so that you can control it with a third linear actuator, though I suppose Lego left this out as it requires that you control it from the arm itself rather than the cab.

The build is rather repetitive to start with as you build the base, but that's A) only to be expected and B) it's mercifully quick. When you start building the cab, it is somewhat difficult to see how it is coming together, but when you realise where the parts are going to end up it's more fun.
It's also one of the most complex Technic sets I've built recently.

Overall, 5/5. The build is the weakest point, but once up and running this is a brilliant set, a near-perfect representation of an excavator (though I must confess it would lose a point if I didn't like excavators).
It's also worth noting that excavators are amongst the most technically challenging builds, so Kudos to Lego's designers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Flying_Dutchman","2008-09-10T09:57:43.233Z","No review, but some useful info","@ Wiseman,

I too was looking for the B-model instructions (for 8297), so I wrote TLC an email and got this URL back:

Enjoy,

Kind regards,

PS. 
Since it's only a matter of time until I own this set and I've seen the instructions, I'll rate this set a 4. Also because otherwise I couldn't post this useful info :-)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Trebor","2010-01-01T07:07:02.593Z","Nice Little Excavator","I just got this model off ebay for Â£22 which I considered not a bad price.

The build was quite easy, it took me about 3 hours all together, the colour scheme works well and makes a nice change from the usual yellow.

The set is quite fun to play with once built, although I think I will have to get a Power functions set to fully appreciate it.

Pros:
Easy build
Nice colour scheme
Tracks can be used for moc'ing
Looks nice-this is a nice display model

Cons: 
As other reviewers have mentioned, the bucket is not independently controlled. To be fair to the designers though there is no way I can see of adding the 3rd actuator necessary, without making the model bigger and more complex to accomodate the necessary parts.

The only way you could do it is to have a worm and gear arrangement and move it manually as with the 8295 telelhandler forks.

Model likes to topple over at full reach, I suspect if I put the power functions in it would help stabilise the model.

All in all a nice addition to anyones collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"aldredd","2009-03-25T08:04:54.64Z","Great build - especially with the Power Functions","Well, seeing as their isn't a review from someone having used the power functions, I thought I'd write a short review.

I picked this model up brand new at a reduced 'to clear' price, so value for money just got a big tick!

it was interesting to build, with lots of gears (which I like) although as others mentioned, starting off with the under carriage is a bit boring, but soon over with. It wasn't overly difficult to build, although putting the arm together was a little fiddly.

I decided before I even built the model that I wanted the power functions for it (which were also reduced in price in another store!).
The power functions were fairly straight forward to install, although it does feel like you're taking nearly the entire model apart!

the motor and battery box fit snugly within the model - you would hardly know they were there.

One thing that struck me as a little odd was that they didn't include the lights from the power functions set in the upgrade instructions. (in that they were included in the power functions, but not used on this set).
So I installed them myself - install them at the same time as installing the switch - and feed the cable to the battery box the same as the switch cable, and then push the light into the lights either side of the main arm - wasn't difficult was it?

I'm also a tad disappointed at the recent trend not to include the instructions for B models. Yes, you can download them from the 'net, I buy lego to get me away from the computer, not to sit in front of it whilst I build lego. Just cost-cutting exercise I suspect. If so, they why not cut the packaging down a bit?

Regarding the linear actuators, I think they're a great addition and alternative to pneumatics, and can be easily motorised.
I'm not a big fan of bespoke pieces either, but these have now appeared on at least two other models already, and I would expect to see them on more in the future.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BigMac","2009-09-19T00:35:58.92Z","Easy to make this a remote controlled machine like 8275","I think most of the pros and cons were mentioned already. I want to point out the followings:

1. Motorise the model make it much more easy to operate.
2. It can be easily to make this a remote control movable machine like 8275, just add one small motor to each track belt. One at the front and one at the back , just have enough space to install these motors. Put the remote sensor on top ie behind the contol cabin.
3 Altogether, you need 3 motors, one to control the excavator arm, two to move the machine around. One remote sensor to control the forward, backward and turning of the vehicle. Of course a remote control to move the engine around.

This one I give it a 4.5 rating

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This set has been released in 2008. It was the smaller hence cheaper of the two models that introduced the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4528037"" title=""linear actuator"">(big) linear actuators</a>. Therefore I bought it at that time.</p>

<h3>Model</h3>

<p>The model is bigger than previous excavators 8851 and 8837. I like the tracked undercarriage better than that from 42006 as it appears to be more realistic with the small supporting rollers. However, there is also more friction when pushing the model around.</p>

<p>The drivers cabinet is well built. The motor housing has been designed without any panels and makes for a nice appearance. However, it is mostly empty space as the gearbox takes only a small part of it (estimated 20..25%).<br />
Designers have added a few studded bricks: one plate holds the exhaust the other one is intended to mount the polarity switch if power functions are added to the model.</p>

<p>A big bonus is choice of colours for this model as red and dark grey with some sparkles of white go very well together. You may find a black and yellow version on brickshelf for comparison.</p>

<p>The model has only few stickers that do not add to the overall look.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>Two linear actuators are controlled from the back of the superstructure. Only one of them can be operated at a time. In my opinion this reduces playability. You will have to switch a lot to simulate a digging movement of the shovel.<br />
Also, the manual operation of actuators is tedious as designers planned a 20-tooth gear. Why not use a crank lever like <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4563044"">this one</a> instead?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides that, superstructure can be rotated freely on the turntable and the model can be pushed on its tracks.</p>

<h3>Comparison</h3>

<p>I my opinion 8294 cannot stand against 8837 which has less than half the number of parts but better functions.</p>
