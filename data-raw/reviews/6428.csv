"GTC","2008-09-20T05:00:48.873Z","Nice build","This was my first build in around 25 years since I was a wee one and loved playing with Lego. I'd always wanted to give a Technics set a try and enjoyed putting this together.

It is big, but a little ugly to look at, but the mechanics are nice. You get 4 wheel steering, good gearing mechanism allowing for a switch between raising the boom and extending the boom, which is well executed. Not too much repetition.

I enjoyed this enough that I went out and bought two more sets, and am always looking for a very challenging build. I also added the motor as I felt it is a shame not to add a motor to any set and get the full impact of the mechanics deployed.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Exo_brick","2009-01-26T16:51:50.467Z","Wow","What a great set. Yesterday, I went to the King of Prussia Mall (PA) for the lego store. As I walked into the store, the box caught my attention. I walked over there, picked it up, and it was hefty, I mean it was like 6 pounds! I integrated my own motor from set 4895 and it works well, I also had that special gear that lets slippage under high strain from RIS 2.0.

Pros:-Gigantic for 89.99(The Off-Roader is about the same size)
-A vast selection of pieces
-Big wheels that I didn't have before
-A special switching system that controls the boom angle AND the length (look at the seat, to the right there is a red lever)
-Amazingly realistic
-Loads of gears and 8 of those plates with teeth
-Retractable outriggers

Cons:- Steering only works well on hardwood flooring(My whole house has it!)
-Exhaust pipe controls outriggers, looks funny in disengaged position

"Lexhoya","2009-07-24T08:27:42.543Z","Love it, but buy the motorsets...","I had to choose between this set and save some more money for the M8275. I wanted something new, now and fast, so it was this set. I will save for the other set later ;)

Pro's:
The lineair actuator has quit some strength in this set.
4-wheen steering, love it, like the mechanisms used to make this all work.
Large wheels, like it, can climb 'large' objects.
The overall details of this set are almost real.
B-model is nice as well.
You can use the chassis of this set to make a lot of other different vehicles.
It can be motorized.
The boom can handle also heavier loads when completely extended.
Gear for the extending/lifting of the boom, alsways wanted one, bought some extra gears now.

Con's:
The large wheels are not 'hard', but can be used to drive over rocky bottom.
The studs at the front of the A-model... just don't do it.
The 4-wheel steering does not line up all the time (front-back do not sync).
The B-models actual loader is not too heavy in use.
Should be available also in an 'extended version', with the motors inside.
You need to print the B-model yourself (140 pages).

Overall:
Value for money is good, since you have several extra mechanisms to build, nice buildtime (also for newbies) and it is in the same scale as a lot of other 'building' sets in the Lego-Technic-Construction-range.

And now back to saving for the M8275... :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Lola","2009-12-14T06:48:20.047Z","A disappointing, not very toyable... toy.","There's a trend in Technics these last years where what you build isn't showing you how stuff works - what you build is usually well designed, well engineered: pleasant toys full of various functions to play with later on or to put on a shelf - see looks and fun of 8285 'Tow truck', and best of all to me, 8275 'Bulldozer' - they rocks!

Now, the obvious trade-off is that there isn't much space for mods. As toys, engineering is real cool, they are sturdy and, usually, highly functional; building them up is part of the pleasure, fiddling with them has been mostly removed from the programme since the advent of studless beams - look at 8674 'Ferrari F1 Racer 1:8' for instance (but 8674 one at least has real-life F1 suspensions, if not much else)


Well, this 8295 one is not cool, nor nice, nor well engineered, not any of this. I am used (and still bored) to non-steering wheels on steering mechanisms (8285 again, or 8289 'Fire Truck'); used to useless stabilisers that are only there for show (...8285), but I wasn't ready to face a steering system that doesn't work fully from stop-to-stop and protrudes so much from underneath that you can only operate the thing on the flattest of surfaces; a boom mechanism that twists under the force needed to extend it; and such heavy, cumbersome boom lifting process. Plus poor looks: boom-wise, it's the anti-8285 which boom work really well and does lift (small) stuff.

As pointed by fellow reviewers, this set brings some interesting parts, like the big wheels (parts 45982+41896) and the clutch (part 6539)+clutch actuator lever system (part 6641). Less cool is the Linear Actuator, but that's because these feel like they have been imposed on us as replacement for the much geekier, cooler Pneumatics... And nobody asked for the retirement of pneumatics in the first place! That said, the Linear Actuator isn't bad by itself, and is probably the easiest way to transform a PF motor rotating force into linear. Speaking of which, if you plug in the PF motors, the boom operation becomes less tedious, but better put an XL one in there, if only to lift the boom by itself (no, you can't lift it with anything on the pallet). That is, preferably without the friction gear safety (part 60c01) in the process or it will slip and the boom won't raise at all. Of course, there is no native way to move 8295 with the motors, it's only for the boom level and length.

One feature to notice tough: it is the first time I stumble upon a steering setup where, as in real life, the inside wheel turns more than the outside one: this is mandatory in vehicle engineering, and is generally ignored by toy makers, Lego included. This feat doesn't save the day, as it add to the vagueness, spongeness to the full 4-wheel steering mechanism that isn't so neat and tidy in the first place, relying as it is on the 'Knob Wheel' (part 32072) .


I usually like to make fair (longer) reviews, pondering pros and cons, but these 139USD aren't swallowed yet. I was looking forward to the 4-wheels steering, I knew the pallet hook wasn't remotely controlled but yet, over the shortcomings I expected, this is too much. I give it a 1/5 for some good parts to have+asymmetric steering wheels, and 0 for everything else, including full wheel steering system.

Only buy at clearance/discount, for the big rubber wheels and clutch (and actuator if you need one). there is no engine, no pistons, no extra-cool parts rare otherwise here [but maybe for the 4 stop-ended axles in 8-lengths (part x1739)]; yet it's still a 1182 parts set with lots of variety, so it's no nothing. But you don't need to build it.

As you probably know it has 4 wheel steering. 4WS is cool but it really only works when it's on something hard like a table. The 4WS also doesn't work the best because both axles don't turn at the same rate every time.

If you're going to get this set i would suggest that you hook it up with power functions because it is too slow and hard to turn with your hand.

For what you're getting it's a good set. It's easy to build, good details, and fun to play with.

"EtudeTheBadger","2013-06-04T15:30:57.51Z","Reach For The Sky!","<p>I got this thing off Amazon after reading about it and wanted to see what the set was like for myself. It looked great; huge wheels, intricate design and a pretty impressive set of functions.</p>

<h4>Building It</h4>

<p>Well. With 1182 parts, this wasn&#39;t a quick afternoon jolly. It took me an afternoon and the following morning, and was enjoyable. I liked slipping in the gears and the linear actuator (this was one of the first sets to feature it) and wondering how it was all going to come together when I turned this or that. The stickers look cool - I managed to resurrect them from a fairly mashed-up sheet; one was stuck to a manual! - and I really like the DANGER sign as well as the cab controls.</p>

<p>After a few hours, I was done, and I was really pleased with the finished model. It is massive, and you feel great when you&#39;ve built it. It looks seriously tough and the details such as the front jacks and the exhaust pipe look cool.</p>

<h4>The Finished Thing And Playing With It</h4>

<p>It looked cool when I&#39;d built it. However, the coolness wears off a little when you actually use the Telescopic Handler. First, while I really appreciate the mechanisms that run through the length of the vehicle, such as the actuator controls and the steering system, it&#39;s all a case of too little spread over too much area. The gears and rods are put under immense pressure with some functions, the boom levelling being the worst candidate here. The rear knob that turns and raises the boom is difficult to spin, and feels like you&#39;re pulling an Easter Island statue up over a cliff with a fishing rod.</p>

<p>Said rear gear can be rerouted by the sprocket by way of a clever handle in the cab - love the sticker that goes along with it! - to lengthen the boom, and this feature works well, probably because the mechanism is relatively self-contained and doesn&#39;t have too much distance to cover. I really like the pallet that comes with the set, and the forks that carry it can be adjusted by a gear at the top of the boom. I know a lot of people see that as a little lame, but it doesn&#39;t really bother me.</p>

<p>The steering of the Telescopic Handler - oh, dear. This vehicle is almost impossible to steer if not on a smooth surface - I challenge any moosh to turn the wheels while the Telescopic Handler is stationary on carpet. The control light actually came off in my hand one time! Again, like the boom levelling, it&#39;s laborious and a case of too little spread too far - a few knob wheels and long rods cover the entire vehicle. The front and rear axles are not in synchrony, and this makes for an uneven experience when trying to steer the Telescopic Handler. Not good.</p>

<p>I actually like the jacks with their little stripe stickers and stuff. Sure, they&#39;re not as efficient and well-implemented as, say, those of 8069, but they look nice and work best if the front of the Telescopic Handler is raised off the ground and placed back down with the jacks fully lowered. The exhaust stack that acts as a lever does look odd when the jacks are up and the stack tips back, though.</p>

<h4>Maaboo Thirty Five&#39;s Special POWER FUNCTIONS Bit For Power Functions-Compatible Sets</h4>

<p>This model is compatible with the 8293 set, and I was anxious to try it out. So I got an 8293 and set it all up. Some extra parts come with the set to fit the motor and its battery box. The lights from 8293 can be fit into the studs at the front of the vehicle and light up real nice.</p>

<p>There needs to be a certain amount of play in the gear system for the setup to work, though - if it&#39;s a little too tight, the motor will be unable to operate the boom. I found this out the hard way when I rebuilt the Telescopic Handler for the second time and spaced the gears correctly. Make sure everything spins as it should, and the motor should work. The overall result is quite impressive, and it&#39;s fun seeing the boom raise and extend.</p>

<h4>Da B-Model</h4>

<p>The Log Loader vehicle, the alternate model for this set, is only buildable with plans that have to be downloaded. That&#39;s a pain. This set and 8294 were the first sets to implement this unwelcome feature. The Log Loader, however, is worth downloading the instructions for. It uses a similar chassis design as the main model, which is unusual, but instead features an enormous bulldozer blade with gripping claws. This is impressive, and it&#39;s really huge - while the 8069 and 8265 B-models can carry a single log, this can handle a stack!</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot easier to operate, too. The Log Loader is much lighter than the main model, and its functions are fairly linear. The steering works better, as well. This doesn&#39;t mean that it lacks some complexity, though - it still uses the transmission system seen in the Telescopic Handler. This routes the rear-mounted gear control from the lifting of the front blade to another fancy feature - a raising cab section! Cool.</p>

<p>Oh, and the Log Loader also has a natty little access ladder.</p>

<p>It&#39;s rare that we get a B-model that betters the main attraction, but I think the Log Loader manages it.</p>

<h4>Pros and Cons</h4>

<p>After all that, here&#39;s a rundown of the good and not so good bits of the set!</p>

<p>Pros (A-model)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Some lovely visual details</li>
	<li>Looks great next to other TECHNIC construction vehicles</li>
	<li>The boom&#39;s telescopic function works well</li>
	<li>Stickers look nice too, and there&#39;s not too many of them</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons (A-model)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Most of the mechanisms are overstretched and difficult to operate</li>
	<li>Steering is poor</li>
</ul>

<p>Pros (B-model)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Looks impressive</li>
	<li>Some innovative features</li>
	<li>Easy to operate</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons (B-model)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Not as intricate as the main model</li>
	<li>Feels a little flimsy in places</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Final Words</h4>

<p>The Telescopic Handler is a pretty good set. While it doesn&#39;t quite manage to become a classic, it&#39;s certainly solid, with a decent range of parts and functions, and a great B-model.</p>

"perbonde","2014-09-08T20:20:14.913Z","Great set. Just pay attention when aligning everything!","<p>Hi everyone. This is my first review. I just startet with Technic one month ago. I have bought 60+ sets, assembled 40+. And this is one of the best. It is the biggest set&nbsp;I have made. I have one remark to all about this set: &nbsp;<strong>Just pay attention when aligning everything! </strong>I will not tell you where to pay attention, but everything works, if you follow the instructions.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I bought this set used, without the box. I have used both the printed instructions, and the PDF. Works like a charm. I have not build the B-model. &nbsp;<strong>Just pay attention when aligning everything!</strong></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I do not make MOC, so i just think it is a great set, with a&nbsp;lot of parts. I am new to Technic, so&nbsp;I do not know which parts are rare or special.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Great build. I do not agree with a lot of the other reviewers. This is complicated. And&nbsp;I think&nbsp;the negative reviews reflect, that you have made some errors when assembling. &nbsp;<strong>Just pay attention when aligning everything! </strong></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This model is huge. I think it is beautiful. Nothing is overstressed, my fingers do not hurt, when lifting and lowering the boom. &nbsp;The red knop is not jumping out of position. The four wheel steering works perfectly. The only thing&nbsp;I can agree with, is that it can not lift a lot. But is that the intention with Technic?</p>

<p>- great build,</p>

<p>- beautiful,</p>

<p>- difficult build,</p>

<p>- a lot of parts,</p>

<p>- pure joy when everything works.</p>

<p><strong>Building/Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Well I love building lego, so It&#39;s still fun, there is some Modular aspect to this build. Basically you make a part and attach it to main build. It was a bit different from the sets that I have build so far, because the modular building was pretty constant through the build. Build time is pretty decent spanning about 3 evenings on casual tempo. I don&#39;t remember any stand out parts for this build.</p>

<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s quite weak on aesthetics wise so for Shelf collectable&nbsp;lovers It&#39;s probably a not needed set. But let&#39;s be honest How pretty can Telescope handler be</p>

<p><strong>Playability/ functionality</strong></p>

<p>As it&#39;s not a collectable or a pretty set it should be very playable right ? I&#39;d say It&#39;s pretty weak actually in that regard. The 4 wheel steering does not work very well and all the functions work quite slowly and it&#39;s even a bit hard to use.</p>

<p><strong>Value for money:</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s still quite cheap set. And you get a lot of building time. Maybe I am too new on this so I think it was worth the money. I bought it used.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I think this is average set it felt average on aesthetically and in playability department.</p>
