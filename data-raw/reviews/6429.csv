As for the looks, i have to admit that its an eye catcher. The color combinations are stunning. When i first got the box, i was really amazed at how big the wheels are and when i was done with it, the overall model is amazingly huge. Sadly, i doesn't really offer that much traction in real off-road terrain. 
 
The construction itself is a bit &quot;hollow&quot; due to the barren back space where u would place the motor. Could have been better with an XL motor and some other functions. The back portion is rather flimsy. My back hood looks as if its drooping down. 

The plus point of this set that it spots a shorter new type of swing arm for the front suspension. Personally, this looks great and i must say i could do a lot with it in the future. 

But seriously, compared to the other flagship models, this could have been better.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"JoonasM","2008-09-04T05:44:10.013Z","A good base for modding","I truly miss the times of the SuperCar with the 4WD, 4Wheel steering and transmission etc. This set is very properly functioning and good looking, but as cons I would say too stiffy suspension and a bit too flexy chassis for an off-road truck. Well.. changing the springs to longer and softer ones, adding drive to front wheels, maybe more motors etc, its a lot of fun to come.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Huw","2009-01-20T17:21:22.497Z","Great mechanics","Every year, the density of parts and complexity of mechanisms seems to increase in Technic sets. The chassis of this vehicle is incredibly complex and packs in a lot of functionality: steering, adjustable suspension, rear-wheel drive and winch.

The result is a very impressive model to look at and play with. However the elegance of the design has had an effect on the robustness of the finished model: it's incredibly flimsy. It's usually fun rocking Technic cars side-to-side or front-to-back to test the suspension but when you do it with this model the chassis flexes so much that if you press down left-back the front-left spring doesn't move: instead the chassis bends.

Apart from that it's a nice model. Not quite up to the standards of previous 'super cars' but not bad nevertheless.

"DrZeldenrustig","2008-09-21T06:42:07.483Z","Great stuff","Sure, everyone of the above said is true. 
(No 4wd, no working steering wheel, etc. etc.)
But it still is many hours of great building fun. 
This model was my ""Flagship"" build since the 8466. 
I made me all enthusiastic again.
Can't wait to get it fully RC!
All in all. A great model for a great price. (If you shop around!!)

"tropeano","2009-06-12T12:20:59.467Z","looks good, mechanic is poor","I'm having in front of me both the models, the 8466 and the object of this review, the 8297. 
Almost all has been said in the previous review regarding this model and i agree with the following:

- stiff suspension (so stiff that they erase the fun in riding the car over objects ect.)
- you got the power function and you use it for the winch? come on...
- only rear drive? ... on this kind of vehicle? strange
- gear box? where is it...
 
I've been watching on Youtube several videos on how to improve the 8297 by inserting front drive, limited slip differential, third differential on the center etc...and this is the kind of vehicle that one should expect especially after having own the 8466...that yes doesn't looks as good but man...

The 8466 it boasts 4WD, 5 gearbox, 3 differential, seagull opening door mechanism like her new cousin and it is so easy to put lights, winch and with a bit of a struggle maybe also the suspension height mechanism...

I'm sorry guys but i've been disappointed by this model, i'm gonna use the pieces for my MOC.

"BigMac","2009-04-04T22:04:09.797Z","GOOD DESIGN, AESTHTHICALLY ITâ€™S A 10","I am an old Lego collector. I have been collecting Lego, especially technics models, for about twenty years. Of course, I have many good sets and inevitably some bad ones. The favourable ones like 8862, 8865, 8868, 8480, 8460 and 8448 have followed me for years - the recent ones on my shelf are 8421, 8285, 8275 and 8297, they are all incredible design. As I said, I do have several disappointing sets like  8145, 8295 and 8274. There are several more which I will not mention because most Lego Models are just too good to be missed, and of course, these are just personal preferences. For example, when compare with Technic Series, I question why most Star Wars models have an unreasonable high rating. Don't get me wrong - I have several great Star Wars models, some of which are really beautiful and great, but certainly not most of them.

This is my first time to put my review on Brickset, because I found the rating to 8297 at just 3.8 at the time of my post. This is absolutely unfair to the set and to the effort of Lego's design team. My comments on this set are as below:-

Pros:

1. Aesthetically just unbeatable even compare with 8466. From my point of view, I would say 8297 is even better and looks more realistic. Just look at them and compare.
2. The LED head light is being used the first time in Technic, enhancing the appearance of the set especially in dark situation. Of course, at this stage as the first attempt by the designer, there is still room for improvement.
3. The gull wing door, which is just fantastic. The rise up of the door controlled by the pneumatic piston is just genius for using in toys.
4. The motor controlled front mounted winch on is also a new attempt, and is great to play with.
5. The motorised suspension to raise or lower the body of the 4WD is another new feature being used.
6. The price is very reasonable, I cannot say cheap as I am not rich, just 11 US Cents per piece, bear in mind that includes the motor, switch, Led headlights, connecting cables and battery box.

Cons:

1. No transmission.
2. It is not a 4 wheel drive, only a rear wheel propelled vehicle.
3. The axles controlling the rise/lower of the car body block up the seats, but cannot be seen when the door is closed.

Others

Many people commented that the suspension is far too firm which I don't agree with, to be honest as I have the model in front of me now. I press it again and again and it is not that bad. Remember this is an Off Road Jeep is not suppose to be too comfortable. Why no complaint to the very poor (or even not provide with) suspension systems of the Ferrari Series because simply they don't need this.

I believe all the ratings here are basically a comparison with the other models. I don't think there is an absolute marking of ""yes"" or ""no"". After reasonable comparison with all other technics models in terms of aesthetics, joy of building, functions and price etc. I would definitely give it a FIVE.

Great work by Lego's design team. This one has put up a platform for lots of further development.

"Lola","2011-01-07T18:06:13.903Z","Waste of money, and engineering.","My Fellow Posters here already pointed the weaknesses that really drove me mad on this 100+ EUR set: the weak chassis (the roof line isn't straight, flexes in the middle at rest!), too stiff springs, poor use of PF motor, no 4x4, no gearbox... This is no Off-Roader!<br><div><br></div><div>Let me add to this already somewhat heavy list:</div><div>- Steering wheel&nbsp;disconnected&nbsp;from front wheels - an unfortunate trend in post-2005 Technic boxes, alas. Still I can't admit it, tough.<br></div><div>- Suspension Raise system weak, the axles flex more than the yellow 'sturdy' type springs!</div><div>- Wheel hubs are 3-pin type, you can't re-use the suspension arms with older wheels.</div><div>- As opposite to 8275 Bulldozer, nothing was thought about on how to change the batteries easily in the PF battery box without dismantling the rear of the set.<br></div><div>- The engine position is way too high in the bodywork, feels unnatural.</div><div>- Absolutely no niceties, even superficial ones (but for the doors): no exhaust, carburettors, dashboard,... I don't know: a toolbox, roof lights, adjustable seats, nothing!</div><div><br></div><div>Only niceties are the PF switch, the 2 LED lights and the rather big wheels. The doors are indeed smooth.

"jojoguy10","2009-11-25T14:12:40.25Z","Awesome Set!","When I got this, I was like ""WOW!"".  but when I used it about 3 days later, the clutch gear that controls the winch started rubbing against the beam.  This isn't a REALLY bad thing, but I was a little worried, but it does work.  Now on to the Pros and Cons:

Pros:
Lots of good pieces
New Differential
BIG wheels!
Motor!
Lights
cool doors

Cons:
Gear for winch grinds on the beam
Sometimes the winch gets into knots.

"Seventh_Son","2009-12-14T09:09:12.403Z","Not your average Technic supercar","Even though being a ""typical"" Technic-supercar scale set, it is actually no where near one.

My biggest gripe is how could they have possibly not included a 4 wheel drive in an off-roader? This goes beyond any comprehension. A gear-box could have been a nice bonus (obviously there is none). Extremely stiff suspension does not add any playability at all.

What it does have is build pretty solidly though. Suspension-raising mechanism works nicely, the gull doors are fun to play too. The winch works as expected.

Looks do easily get a 9/10. The back could have been a bit more detailed.

Overall an OK set. I wouldn't call it a very technical representation of a real off-roader, but it does look good as a display model on a shelf.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"markuslong","2010-01-06T15:38:56.433Z","My favorite Technic set so far","Awesome set, itâ€™s big, lots of detail, and comes with all the power accessories you will need. The Lambo doors are my favorite feature on this set. Just gently push on the ball shaped parts on top and watch as the doors slowly come up! 
After playing with it I think a manual winch would have been better. It just gets tangled easily and the hook is not that great.  A bigger hook, a true 4X4, and trading the powered winch for powered mobility is something Iâ€™ll try on a rebuild. Plus I just down loaded the instructions for the 2nd model the Buggy. I look forward to that all so.
Donâ€™t forget about the powered ride height adjustment. This will make up for any short falls you may think the set has. Watching the body go up and down helps make up for the ridiculous price of this set, this by far the biggest down fall of all big Lego sets.
I went to Toys R Us looking for the new Technic mobile crane (has some Christmas cash to spend). But they were all out so I got this set instead (last one on the self). I was charged $130 and after taxes it was close to $143. The Lego store has it listed for $120, so buying this set online is the way to go. After shipping, taxes, etc. if you are around the $120 range itâ€™s a good deal. Donâ€™t get ripped off like I did.
Anyway, I really enjoy the set and recommend it to all Lego fans.
