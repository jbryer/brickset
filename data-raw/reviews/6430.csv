"legobear","2008-05-14T03:38:57.7Z","Disappointing","This set is absolutely disappointing with a price mark of $9.99.  I believe the point was to create two vehicles (does not matter the quality) and use the two figures to sell the set. I'm utterly disappointed only because I'm a die-hard lego fan, and seeing the type of strategy used here to market this product is quite offensive.  I know Lego needs to sell their products somehow, but I also know that Lego's pledge is to sell quality toys. I would have loved to see in this set that someone gave it at least 1 hour in the design process.  If you have to spend $10.00s anywhere on any other set, find another set.  ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"water_jedi_17","2008-05-23T20:47:32.59Z","Worst batman set","Possibly the worst set ever that lego has made it's also the smallest batman set.Mr.freeze is the same but has a new gon using the blue lightning in the castle sets.A long black tube connects to hais back or to the crystal holder.It comes with two brand new blue diamonds.The bottom compromises of two blue pieces that look like the piece on the Green goblin set.in between is an engine like piece.Unfortunately there is no controls and is completely useless for chases(or escapes).
 Now the batbuggy is slightly better but it is still bad.it's only weapon,a grappling hook is meabnt more for displaying purpose since there's no rope or launcher to make it exactly like a grappling hook.The giant flame piece is a pure joke.It's almost the same length of the buggy and really ruins that section.The batwing also ruins it since it pokes out too far.The minifigs are ok with anew batman from the new movie and mr.freeze.Unfortunately,that's the only good thing so don't buy it.(ps no gadjets are included)  ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"_add_um","2008-07-04T13:22:19.343Z","Disappointing Batman set","<p><b>*Review was revised on the 17th of December 2013*</b></p><p>Simply the weakest set produced from the original Batman theme. This mainly due to the fact how silly the set looks.</p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The 2008 Batman box art changes after remaining the same for the first two years of theme. The box art ties in with the Nolan Batman movie;&nbsp;<i>The Dark Knight</i>, as the movie logo appears in the corner of the box and instructions instead of the comic book logo. Despite this, the scenario of the set doesn't tie in with the movie at all. There's also a cartoon version of Bale's Batman on the bottom corner too. Personally I prefer the art used with the 2006 and 2007 sets. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Some interesting parts do appear in the set. However the piece count is quite low. Two light-blue jewels are included which aren't seen that often in cheap sets like this. A Bionicle flame sword also comes with the set (it's used as the flame exhaust for the Batman's buggy) which is nice. Mr. Freeze's helmet is also extremely rare now too. So this set has some great rare parts and piece included.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Only two minifigures appear in the set. Batman and Mr. Freeze. This version of Batman comes in three out of the four sets in 2008 (the other set comes with Robin). Batman's new outfit is based off <i>The Dark Knight</i>&nbsp;however there are some differences. Firstly the use of Batman's white eyes remain on the minifigure and the suit is grey and black instead of just black. The print detail on the torso is great but I wish lego had made the entire suit black to match the cowl and cape. Mr. Freeze is the exact same as the one in set 7783. He isn't very detailed, his torso is just plain blue with no printing at all. It's isn't too noticeable as the gear covers the torso anyways. I really like the head piece used which is unique for him. Freeze also gets a freeze gun but it looks very plain, I like how it can be attached to his car. All in all I like the figures a lot. And it's a great way to get Freeze if you missed him in the other set.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very simple it should only take about ten minutes, thankfully there's no stickers to apply.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>After completing the model you'll see how underwhelming it is. Both vehicles just look silly and poorly made. First off the buggy looks like a complete mess with too many colours being used, there's just random yellow, blue, grey and black pieces used and doesn't look attractive. I really wish lego didn't use the giant flame piece at the back it just looks stupid to me. I also dislike how the wing/tail fin of the buggy is attached to it and how it's not fixed in one place. So the fin can just turn freely and very easily, which is annoying. Mr. Freeze's cart also just look awful. It's simply just too small. I like the baby blue colours that are used and thankfully the colours don't clash here like they do on the buggy. But no steering wheel is given which is very confusing. The back of the vehicle has a jewel in a vase which powers the Freeze gun. And the freeze gun is attached to the vase part with a pipe. The vase can also be taken off the car if you wish to.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall nice minifigures especially if you don't already own Mr. Freeze. But the model itself is flimsy and just silly looking. I'd say stay away unless you want the parts or the figures.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,2,4,2,2,3

"AETerry","2011-05-10T14:11:10.227Z","Batman Buggy & Escape of Mr. Freeze Review","<p>I'll start off with when this set first came out, at $9.99 retail, this made for one of the smallest Batman Theme sets available and affordable to collectors and kids who wanted some of these sets. If you weren't able to afford the larger, more expensive Batcave set, this was an easy way to get ahold of the character Mr. Freeze. As I was enjoying a renaissance with joy and love of LEGO and not just LEGO, but Batman too... it was easy to grab up this set first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the Batman sets revolved around vehicles... that said, the vehicles aren't always inspired unless it was basing a vehicle off one that everyone knows Batman has utilized at some point or another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two vehicles in this set aren't very inspiring. I'm not sure I'd call Batman's Buggy a buggy... it's almost like a oversized go-kart to me. But it's a quick easy design and that's about all it gets beyond the grappling gun up front.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Freeze's vehicle... that to me comes across as more of a buggy, I'm one to think of a buggy as small and compact. There's a couple of blue gemsones, one of which is used for Freeze's Freeze Gun. It's okay, just not the greatest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just that compared to the Batman Dragster - Catwoman Chase set that also sold for $9.99, I prefer the Dragster set over this one. Catwoman got an honest motorcycle and more pieces were spent on the dragster build so it came across as a solid build where this set is trying to split a piece count between 2 vehicle and keep it economical for collectors and fans, but falls short.</p>

"calzonie","2022-07-01T05:16:12.39Z","Mostly Good, with One Big Eyesore","<p>This is a prime example of the kind of&nbsp;set that you&#39;ll just want for the figures. &quot;Batman&#39;s Buggy: The Escape of Mr. Freeze&quot;&nbsp;is&nbsp;the cheapest way to get Batman&#39;s 2008 suit, and a much less expensive alternative to buying the 2006 Batcave for Mr. Freeze.</p>

<p>Both of these figures are&nbsp;good, although I&#39;m not sure why this batsuit based on The Dark Knight&nbsp;is dark grey instead of black.&nbsp;Maybe it was to differentiate him from the other black costume? That&#39;s my theory, but&nbsp;I like the change regardless.&nbsp;I LOVE the&nbsp;Freeze minifig though.&nbsp;He looks&nbsp;very retro-future like he did in Batman: The Animated Series, and the 80s/90s LEGO space parts the designers chose&nbsp;for the cryo suit really reinforce that.</p>

<p>Freeze&#39;s buggy is fun, it feels like a very early&nbsp;precursor&nbsp;the Mighty Micros sub-theme that would come out several years later. Does it look incredible? No, but it&#39;s cute, and I like the color scheme.&nbsp;Also, is Mr. Feeze stealing diamonds in reference to Batman &amp; Robin? Maybe I&#39;m reading too far into it, but he does seem to be using it as a power source for his car, and Mr. Freeze isn&#39;t usually the type for petty jewellery&nbsp;theft.</p>

<p>Batman&#39;s buggy, in stark contrast, might be the worst looking vehicle in the entire original Batman run. I recently did a review of Batman&#39;s Dragster&nbsp;from 2006, another childhood set of mine that I will freely admit doesn&#39;t hold up very well.&nbsp;But this buggy is actually worse, and significantly so. It uses uninteresting parts and&nbsp;puts them together in a sloppy fashion. Not only is there is a comically enormous flame coming out of the back end that&#39;s nearly as long as the car itself, but this flame is also structurally integral, because&nbsp;it&#39;s the only point where the bat wing part connects to the rest of the vehicle.&nbsp;So if you don&#39;t like how the flame looks, or you want to briefly remove it to let Batman safely park&nbsp;somewhere,&nbsp;you&#39;ll have to completely redesign the back of the car to get rid of it. This feels like a build I would have made as a kid, digging through my bucket of limited&nbsp;pieces to throw something together without a plan.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even though I really dislike the main vehicle, I&#39;m still giving the set&nbsp;a 3 overall because I genuinely enjoy Mr. Freeze&#39;s buggy a lot, and (if you&#39;re somehow reading this in the year 2008) it&#39;s a very cheap option for these two great figures. Of course, you&#39;re not going to find it cheap anymore, but that&#39;s to be expected with these sets.</p>
