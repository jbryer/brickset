"water_jedi_17","2008-06-07T18:23:35.857Z","Bird wars","This set seems to just be upgraded versions of the two vehicles in the batcave set.It is also a cheaper way to get Robin and Penguin since the only other way to get them is to buy the expensive batcave.Robin's scuba jetis pretty simple and the cockpit is a bit cramped.There are no controls since robin is still young (must be on autopilot)It only has two light pieces as weapons, although flick fire missles would be better.Robin's new hair piece doesn't look good on him, his old hair was much better. Penguin's sub is pretty good.The cockpit is large, you could put a mini penguin inside;but it should be larger. Penguin has a larger unmbrella and a new diamond.The front of the sub even includes a holder. On the back,there is a blunt missle that can be raised approx. 90 degrees.The two flick fire missles are better and don't fall out easily. A final note is a particular sticker.It has the symbol from the Dark Knight and scratches.Hmmm... The only problem with this set is that it has only upgraded vehicles.Maybe a penguin plane and robin jet would be better.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-27T13:11:45.81Z","&quot;This city deserves a better class of criminal, and I'm gonna give it to 'em.&quot;","First of all, why don't more people review this set? It's a GREAT set and people are just sitting there, not spreading the word of great it is! Anyway, this set comes with Robin, the Penguin, two penguins with weapons, a jewel, the Penguin's sub, and Robin's Scuba Jet
The sub is an amazing vehicle and WAY better than that piece of crud included in the Batcave. There is much more room inside, two engines, flick-fires, a missile launcher, and a cool sticker on the front. There is also room for the Penguin to hold the jewel but not the umbrella. Also, the periscope is MUCH better than the previous design.
The Scuba Jet is a very neat little vehicle and again, better than the piece of crud he had before. Contrary to what others might have said, there IS in fact room for Robin's cape. You just have to scrunch it up into that space behind him. There are a pair of engines and a small propeller in the back.

Pros:
Robin's new hair is more realistic
Penguin! (He's one of my four fav Bat-rogues. In order they are: Joker, Penguin, Riddler, Two-face.)
sub and Scuba Jet are MAJOR upgrades
penguin henchman are always a good additon
painted-on radar piece in sub

Cons:
there could have AT LEAST been a sticker or tile representing controls in the Scuba Jet

"David1971","2008-09-05T12:50:55.077Z","Good but not amazing, and relies on stickers (tsk!)","This is a pretty good set; two minifigs and two vehicles for &#163;20 (UK) is decent, and both are well designed ... but somehow not super-special.

The propellers and engines are nice, and Robin's little ship is cute, in nice colours, although - as others have mentioned - it does seem a bit odd that little Robin has to take his cape off to get in.

Both vehicles look less good without their stickers but I hate stickers and don't want to spoil my bricks with stupid stickers, so that adds to the disappointment.

In my recent review of set #6212, the Star Wars X-Wing, I forgot to mention the brilliant fact that where necessary the detail parts were all printed - NO STICKERS! That was one of the many fine details that made that set so excellent.

This set includes quite a lot of decent parts, and the missile launcher works surprisingly well. (The book Forbidden Lego explains how Lego designers are not allowed to make very menacing weapons, for nice reasons, which is why things like this are usually a bit duff and your &quot;missile&quot; typically just flops to the floor. But in this case, it does shoot out and fires across the room! Although I am not that bothered...)

Overall, quite good, but a shame that the sub looks a bit boring without its stickers. But - one more positive note - it's good that it has an interior that the Penguin can actually get into.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"jgptee","2009-07-16T23:17:13.623Z","updated and improved rides for robin and penguin!","i like this set for the following reasons:

1. they look like updated and improved versions of those vehicles that came in the batcave (7783) set.

2. the penguin submarine looks larger (nearly 22-stud long and 8-stud wide) and look more awesome, even without the stickers. the cockpit looks more spacious with a periscope and controls, and penguin can stand on top of submarine when it surfaces. i am not sure whether he can stand there and breathe underwater, as featured on the box art. the submarine also comes with 2 adjustable black and yellow water propellors, a large missile launcher at the back, and 2 much smaller missiles on the sides.

3. instead of a water scooter, robin now has a scuba-jet in all his trademark colours of yellow, red and green. it is a very simple and small build, yet nice and cute for robin.

4. like the batcave set, this one has 2 small brick-built penguins (equipped with weapons). i actually prefer brick-built animals to moulded ones.

5. this set is definitely a cheaper alternative to the batcave, if u are interested in getting the vehicles only.

6. the mini-figures are all the same, but in this one, robin has a new boyish hairdo, instead of the elvis one in the batcave set.

7. the stickers are optional.

there are some drawbacks, however...

1. robin's scuba-jet has no weapons, leaving him totally defenseless. hopefully, it makes up for this shortcoming with higher speed and its ability to make sharp turns. lol!

2. the cockpit of the scuba jet does not have controls, and robin just lie in there. it can be quite a challenge because robin has his cape on.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

You do get Robin though who's only in a few sets. I really like Penguin and his submarine. I also really like the penguins.


Pros:
Penguin's sub can open up to fit penguin inside.
All minifigs are cool.
Cool engine pieces.
sub fires torpedo.

Cons:
Stickers!!
Doesn't have Batman.

"xhunter94s","2010-03-22T19:15:59.297Z","Pretty good","<p>&nbsp;I got this for Christmas '09 and I look and see a box which when I shake it sounds like Legos so I open it last after a few presents (I am pretty poor but gratefull unlike the kids with their PS3s and Xbox360s and cellphones and labtops and etc) and I open it their is a Lego Starwars box (very small) I am disapointed&nbsp;and it says Lego Batman inside so I open it and there are the bags for the Robin's scuba jet set with stickers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;About the set and not some story Penguin's submarine is really awesome. It has flick fire missiles which are loose as usual but if you flick them they go far. There is an angry penguins face on the front which is a nice detail. There is a missile in the back. The top you lift off the rest of the submarine and penguin can just fit inside without anything but his body and head and hat (no umbrella) there is also a&nbsp;neat control panel in it same one as in the batmobile.&nbsp;Penguin can stand on the pull off part which also has a parascope.The outside is detailed good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Robin's scuba jet is small but good. There is a yellow thing on the top but I took it off it does not look good on the scuba jet. The cockpit is small so you have to bend Robin back and sometimes half of his body falls off the legs when laying him back (too far at least). The windsheild is a pull off. There are two small gun things on the sides of the jet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There are two small penguins which are neat and can both hold pistols. The penguin is the same with the hat and short legs and umbrella. Robin has a better hairstyle which reminds me of my own ( I would be a good Tim Drake or Riddler I am crazy like Jim Carey Riddler).</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you want a better view of these sets I might make reviews of them on Youtube ( username xhunter94s )It is a good set if you have the money buy it surelly if not you should think about getting it though.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,5

<p>Well this set is just great! I got it of ebay without box or instructions for only 40 bucks. ( downloaded in. from lego.com) </p>
<p>Minifigs</p>
<p>&nbsp;Well you get Robin with a new hair style, With a very detailed torso. You also get penguin with a diamond and a umbrela. You also get two small penguins, one with a small pistol and the other gets a harpoon!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robin's Scuba jet</p>
<p>Well we have a very detailed jet here. You have small guns in the front, two turbine engines in the front and a prepeller onn the back. Take Robin's cape of so it dosent get ruined. I think this is well designed.</p>
<p>Penguin's sub</p>
<p>Well this is all around awesome! In the bottom you can put penguin down there or you can put the two penguins down there! There is also a telescope down there. On the top we have some flick - fire missles. If you flick them they go very far. Also the looking part of the telescope. Theres room for penguin up there two. In the back there is a giant missle, it can go really far! There is also a detailed face to look like a penguin on the front from stickers. You also have prepellers in the back.</p>

"AETerry","2011-06-02T15:06:19.677Z","Robin's Scuba Jet Review","<p>Of all of the Batman theme sets from Lego with minifigures, this is the only Batman set that doesn't have a minifigure of Batman, which I find to be a relief after all the other sets and having multiple variations of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigures you do have are Robin and Penguin. If you like Batman with his sidekick, this is one of the sets to get pick up and have. Especially if you're on a bit of a budget (from when this set initially came out). The other minifigure of course is Penguin, short and stout like Danny Devito from the Batman Returns movie. He carries and umbrella as part of his trademark. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also giving nods to Batman Returns are the two little penguin builds, both of which are armed to battle Robin and Batman. They were amusing and fun to build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robin gets a Scuba Jet, themed with his logo and coloring on it. It's a rather solid build and where aquatic battles are considered, it helps him and Batman have an edge and numbers working against the villians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Penguin too has a large sub, detailed and modeled to look like a penguin. Giving into some 60's camp and silliness. Still it's a good sub, the top can come off so Penguin can be set inside it. There's a periscope for looking around above the water. Little flick fire missles and a spring cannon in back to fire at Robin's sub as he comes after Penguin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't care much for Boats and Aquatic vehicles (outside of the Atlantis theme) but I still tend to pick up some of them from time to time and in the name of collecting up all of the Batman LEGO sets, this was well worth it. Robin, Penguin, little lego brick Penguins. All very fun and enjoyable to add into my collection.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
