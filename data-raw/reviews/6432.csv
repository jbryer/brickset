The Batman is a slight variation of the original and we finally get
Harley Quinn!(yeah) The only thing I would add is a couple lego dogs for hyenas. Guess I can do that myself.

Especially like the Whack-a-Bat and I heart Joker stickers.

I was obligated to purchase this set for the Harley figure, but $29 dollars seems a bit steep for the set. MHO",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Even the Batman minifigure is something to be excited about because of his new armored look. This set comes complete with weapons, diamonds, and two vehicles. Harley Quinn's truck has a smash hammer and flick fires. The bat bike ( possibly from the upcoming movie The Dark Knight) has a cool design and it too comes with flick fire missiles. A highly recommended set to buy.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,4,3,4,4

"bmwlego","2008-08-30T09:42:41.67Z","Bruce Timm and Paul Dini's Greatest Addition to the Bat-Verse Comes to Life in LEGO Form","I purchased this set yesterday after debating whether or not to buy it ever since I saw it last February at the International Toy Fair in NYC. I knew I wanted the Harley Quinn minifig and she did not disappoint but didn't want to pay $35 for a minifig! I also didn't want to pay what she sells for on ebay which is ridiculous. Finally I gave in and used a coupon to help bring the price of this set by 10 bucks at Toys R Us. 

Minifigs:
Harley is beautiful. She is an absolute 5 out of 5! The new &quot;Jester&quot; style hat is great and is featured in the new Castle Advent Calendar. The torso is accurately detailed as are her legs. Her face looks like the cartoon as well. I am waiting for her to start laughing and express her love for &quot;Mr. J.&quot;

The Batman fig is a new update as he now has an armored look on his torso. I now have all 4 Batsy variations (gray, black, blue and armored) and this might be my least favorite as it looks too detailed for a LEGO Minifig. LEGO figs are somehwat plain but it is this plain style that makes them LEGO and not an action figure. Whereas the attention to detail adds to Harley's look it isn't too detailed. I feel the details on Batman detracts from his LEGO look. 

On to the vehicles:
I am sorry LEGO but you have got to be kidding me with the Batcycle! Batman stands up totally erect on the motorcycle! The design is lacking a LEGO System look as the technic pieces make up nearly the entire profile of the bike. If this vehicle were packaged on its own, it would receive a 1 or a 2. I apologize to the designer of this set if s/he is reading this review.

Harley's Hammer Truck is not as easy for me to score. I'll start with what I like. The color scheme is fantastic and true to Dr. Harlene Quinzel herself. I love the alternating red/black decor. The curved mudguard parts look great on both sides and ends of the Hammer Truck. The Hammer action is cute as it sends Batsy flying once he is struck by the ridiculously over sized hammer! As a matter of fact, the entire Hammer Truck is ridiculously over sized as it is 2 and a half the height of its driver! This works for some reason because Harley is a ridiculously funny character. The use of the red technic bush parts add a pop of red to the hubcaps which is a great technique. The trucks undercarriage at first seems lacking in detail but upon closer inspection this is fine because trucks that are this high up are usually open right above the wheels. 

An interesting point is that after completing this truck, there was 1 red cheese slope and 1 black cheese slope left over. I scoured the directions to make sure that I didn't miss the step where they were used and couldn't find it. I added these 2 parts to the back of the truck where they are used in a similar fashion in the front of the truck. Did anyone else come across this same situation? If so contact me through my brickset profile.

The accessories include the typical tiny bag of bat hooks, and small machine guns and pistols. It also includes 2 small gray handguns for Harley and a Harley sized hammer to flatten the Batman. Of course, Harley needs something to get her into trouble with Batman in the first place and LEGO has provided us with 4 jewels for her to steal from...(I guess we'll have to use our LEGO imaginations to build a jewelry store for Harley to high-jack)!  

The stickers are great as well but unfortunately four of them go across the 8 mudguards that you might want to reuse in a MOC without the stickers!

At first I wanted to give this set a lower score because I really only bought it for Harley. I am a huge fan of the Bruce Timm animated style which brought us The Batman Adventures, Batman and Robin Adventures, Superman Adventures, Justice League, and Justice League Unlimited cartoons and comics. Paul Dini is a writer who collaborated with Timm and helped create Harley, which is why their names appeared in this review's title. If it weren't for these 2 men, we wouldn't have a Harley or a Harley LEGO set. Upon building this set I must say that the Truck looks much better than I expected, Harley is perfect and the new Bat torso is a welcome addition to my Batsy collection. The Batcycle however is just as bad as I expected! If the set was just Harley and her truck it would be a 5 but the addition of the Batcycle brings this score down a notch to a 4 which I guess you could say is subtraction by addition!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"OWF","2008-09-20T02:26:31.827Z","Haaaaarley...","I've never liked Batman, the movie or cartoons, Lego neighter but on this set I was very attracted by Harley Quinn.
Batcycle looks kinda weird and Batman's hat it's too big for a Lego minifig.
Hammer Truck looks great being half n' half, red and black.
The whole car design it's awesome.
Harley Quinn, as minifig I consider her the most beautiful of all time.
Much, much better than the new jester from Advent Calendar, Harley Quinn can be added on any old Castle set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-28T14:23:08.013Z","Now this is funny, Mr. J.","Let me start by saying that it's great to see Harley finally getting in on the action. Also, I'd like to say something to bmwlego regarding that little conundrum at the end of his review regarding the extra pieces: Those are in every set, pal. Lego purposely puts in one or two pieces extra for every bag of pieces in the set. This is just in case you lose one of the really small ones. 
Anyhow, this set is a wonderful addition to any collection, great if you like the Ace of Knaves and Harlequin of Hate, or an excellent gift if you or someone you know has an unhealthy obsession with comic book villainnesses that often borders on creepy. The Bat-cycle is very closely modeled after the Bat-pod from TDK, but not closely enough. As Maxwell Smart would say, they missed it by that much. (Fingers an inch apart) The Hammer Truck is deliciously cartoonish and fits perfectly with Harley's modus operandi. The oversized hammer is a hilarious addition and a welcom change from all those boring missile launchers. I like the fact that the designers were thinking when they cobbled this one together, because we get not one, not two, not three, but FOUR jewels for Harley to steal. We also get the Bat-gadgets, guns, plus a brick-built mallet for Harley and TWO revolvers. (I gave one to Penguin.)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"TheDarkKnight","2008-12-11T21:06:05.937Z","Harley's Truck--Cool. Batman's Bike: Just OK.","The Batcycle and Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck. As soon as I saw it, I forgot my mission to the LEGO City section, and spent my money on this set. And it was well worth it!

Pros:
Harley Quinn minifigure (exclusive to this set).
Bat-Weapons
Four Jewels(!)
TDK Batman
Hammer
The hammer on the truck is a welcome change from the usual launcher.
Batcycle has a nice design, just doesn't resemble the one in the film at all.

Cons:
A lot of stickers.
Batcycle doesn't quite make the cut.

"AETerry","2011-06-03T13:27:02.913Z","The Batcycle Review","<p>First, I don't think I would have called this set ""The Batcycle."" I would have dropped that first part and just called it ""Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck"" as that, to me, is the main feature of this set. Not the Batcycle. Though it is good to see another Batman themed vehicle and one that's seen some use in animated series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get Harley Quinn! That alone is worth it for this set among all the Batman villians in this theme and this set is the only one to get her in. She's got an oversized hammer to use. Batman is also included, which depending on how many sets you'ved picked up, may feel a bit redundant for play or display. He's also, like in all the sets, got a polybag of all of his batman centric weapons and tools along with some weapons for the villians to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The batcycle is very solid in design and enjoyable. I don't care too much for the flick fire missles, but they are there as part of the design. Still it's good to have another vehicle for Batman's fleet to&nbsp; use for his different missions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harley's Hammer Truck... that's the vehicle worth talking about for this set and should be the main feature. It's a huge 4x4 Monster Style rig patterned in red and black like Harley's harlequin outfit. There's a knob at the back of the rig for rotating the huge hammer to smash down on the batcycle when Batman tries to get in close to capture or stop Harley. If I'd designed this, I'd have the hammer come out a bit further, otherwise it seems way in too close to the truck. There is also a crate just behind where Harley sits with a bunch of gemstones she's no doubt stolen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next to the Batwing and Tumbler, Harley's Hammer Truck is one of my favorite vehicles from this entire Theme. Well worth picking up and I had a blast putting it together.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
