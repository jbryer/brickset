The Jokers new ride is very cool icream truck with a missle that fires out the back doors. It has lots of bright colors. Tumble is good just is a bit big to fit in city.

"Monty","2008-06-16T08:26:19.107Z","Rough and Tumble","A couple of years ago I bought 2 of the large Batmobiles (7784) fully intending to use one as a source of parts to produce the Tumbler version from “Bat Man Begins”. Inspired by several very good-looking versions on Brickshelf, I was also collecting various other components – wheels etc, but never quite got round to it.

Imagine my delight when I saw a version of the Tumbler was to be released as an official set. Whilst you also get the ice cream van – I was not really interested in that – my wife made it up as per the instructions. It does fire a missile through the rear doors provided they are open first, but apart from that it is similar to several other similar type vehicles.  Construction is in numbered bags, which is good – the van is all in the first bag so it was easy to separate it out. There are 2 instruction books and the pages were all there and printing was fine – not like before when the black on black was hard to see.

I was more interested in the Tumbler. In my view, it is not a bad likeness, but it was obvious from the box art I would need to start tweaking as I built – if only to eliminate the hideous colours - yellow grey etc showing through that spoil the appearance of the vehicle – remember in the move as Bruce Wayne takes his test drive he asks “does it come in black?” – not black with lots of colours showing through! Once these are replaced it looks less toy like. I also removed the working missiles at side and rear as I do not want to “play” with mine, but I accept these are features that enhance playability.

The main thing I did were just small tweaks to enhance appearance – adding additional bricks as necessary from that spare old 7784 Batmobile I bought. The main areas were to the sides (adding depth and detail) and rear. I also moved the front wheels forward one hole to give a better appearance. I did add the stickers to the windscreen as well as the stickers to the sides and for the rams, in better places than they suggest, but I left off the bat logos – never saw these on the original.

The angular shape of the armour on the original lends itself to Lego, but it is difficult to create the exact shapes out of bricks that are basically square. However, I am pleased with my efforts and think my (currently – may add more later) improved version looks much better that the toy like appearance on the box art – you can judge for yourselves as I will add to Brickshelf no doubt in a few days.

Overall, I thought this was not bad set. I would have liked a slightly cheaper price and I could personally have done without the ice cream van, but the Joker (as well as Batman and crook) Minifig is nice. I guess it is a play set so if you want to play you are not quite so bothered about accuracy and you do need the 2 vehicles – can’t recreate a car chase with only one car!  I think the accuracy level is ok for a play set, so I reckon a 4 is a reasonable rating given the price. A larger UCS Tumbler would be great – Lego please note!

"Loganwan","2008-06-18T02:30:57.42Z","Great Set, if not a little strange pairing","The Tumbler is awesomely well designed in both looks and strength.  The cockpit area definitely is a little bright in the color category.  It is a really good representation of the movie Tumbler, as I was watching the movie as I built the car.
Unlike some others, I did not have any problems with the directions.  I don't know if they were different in my box (maybe fixed on newer shipping).

The Ice Cream Truck is a fun truck, with a good design. It does however seem a little &quot;cartoon&quot; compared to the Tumbler.  The Tumbler is so big that it could pretty much just run over the truck and be done with it.  As for the firing missle in the back, I fired it about 5 times with the doors closed, and it loosened the doors enough that now I don't have to open the doors before firing the missle.  It kind of makes it more of a surprise.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Jim_Java","2008-07-29T15:45:31.2Z","Campy Meets Realistic","As I said in my Batwing review, I hate the fact that Lego is stuck in the 1950s, in terms of Batman vehicles. That all changes here.
The Tumbler, of course, is the Batmobile, redone for the new, more realistic movies,&quot;Batman Begins&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Knight.&quot;  That means it's a lot more practical. Unlike the previous Batmobile, this one is more bulky and blocky than sleek and aerodynamic. It's more tanklike than the mediocre Bat-Tank.  In building terms, it's pretty easy to assemble, but it does take a few hours. And of course, it's got a lot of black pieces, which make the instructions a little harder to read than normal. But it's not that hard, really. 
Once you assemble it, there's quite a bit you can do. The cockpit opens, and Batman can go in. There are three firing mechanisms: A large spring-loaded dart, and two flick-to-fire missiles. The flaps at the  back go up, although since the flaps on mine fit together snug, I sometimes end up snapping them off.
Oh, and then there's the &quot;Uncle Joker's (Yes, Uncle Joker!) Ice Cream Surprise&quot;  ice cream van. Obviously, the Tumbler is the main focus of the set is the Tumbler, and this one resembles Two-Face's van so much, I wonder if the designers just fiddled with that one to make this one. But this one is better, because it has a handhold, instead of the easy-to-fall-out-of seat that Two-Face had, and it has a dart launcher. This is the only Batman set I have encountered where both the villain and the hero have darts.
Two things-one, Batman is equipped with weapons (a batcuff, batarang, and those things with the circles in the center that are impossible for minifigures to hold).  Unlike the previous Batmobile, and Batwing, Batman has no place to put these in the vehicle. Why not?
And secondly: Isn't the pairing a little weird?  The tank-like Tumbler, starring in the realistic and dark movies &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, is paired with the Joker-Cream Mobile, which looks like something out of a Batman cartoon.  I have to ask, as I did with the green-and-purple copter-Where does the Joker get these?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2008-07-04T23:32:39.827Z","probably the most essential batman set to get now!","if u are collecting lego batman for the very first time, this is the first set you should be getting from your neighbourhood toy store, for many many many reasons - too many to list them all down here without putting you off to la la dreamland of batman and joker in a mighty combat! ok, the no.1 reason is that this awesome tumbler is featured very vividly in the current batman movies that star christian bale as the dark knight. secondly, the latest movie, &quot;dark knight&quot;, stars the late heath ledger as the joker (the no.1 villain), so a joker is a must-have in any batman collection.

The joker truck is pretty much standard and sort of reminds me of that 2-face truck from the batmobile set, but this i-scream truck has a missle launcher when you open the rear doors! it also comes with 2 &quot;delicious&quot; green ice sticks that put a very big smile on your face.

the tumbler is just awesome, but not perfect in its construction. it boasts of a 2-seat interior so the dark knight could take the joker for a night out on the town. it is also the only batman vehicle that can take 2 mini-figures. the tumbler looks very appealing and impressive when completed, and i simply love the giant wheels. it also has a missile launcher at the back but i don't see the point, since the sheer size of the vehicle is sure to run over and crush any opposition in its path.

"_add_um","2008-08-22T09:33:46.36Z","A good set but too much yellow =(","<span class=""Apple-style-span"">Overall this is a good set,&nbsp;I've&nbsp;been waiting for a Lego Tumbler every since Lego started making Lego Batman. I was surprised to hear it Lego would be making it at all (since Lego had never based any sets off the Batman movies). The box art has now changed and has ""The Dark Knight"" logo in the corner of the box. The set includes The Tumbler and ""Uncle Joker's"" ice cream truck, I hate skickers but &nbsp;I did enjoy the look of them on the truck, my favorite one was ""I &nbsp;love (heart) Gotham"". This truck is quite simalar to Two-Face's truck except for the lovely ice cream cone on top of the truck which I thought was a nice touch, the only thing I did not like about it that it looks like a truck from the 1950s so it dosen't really match with the more modern Tumbler. Opening the rear doors on the truck reveals the spring load cannon (triggered by pulling back on the cone), its a&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;cool&nbsp;feature but I'd prefer something else, maybe a place to contain the joker weapons like the bombs and joker cards etc. A good build and enjoyable model for Gotham's baddies!&nbsp;As for the Tumbler, it is rather&nbsp;disappointing. First the car itself is&nbsp;gigantic&nbsp;its way too&nbsp;over-sized, the tires are bigger than Batman himself. If Lego get the chance to make this again make it alot smaller just make it slightly bigger than the joker truck. There is also was way too much yellow and blue&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;in the set, it makes the Tumbler very ugly (especially&nbsp;the interior) , in this you can see alot of yellow from the outside. The two seats and steering wheel was also yellow. Bright colours&nbsp;should&nbsp;never belong in any Batmobile and is a real&nbsp;disappointment. Although Lego went for playablity with flick and spring loaded missiles, it would have been better not to in include any at all, just like in the films (""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight""). There was no where to store batman's gadgets either. Now saying all that the good things about it. This is the first Bat&nbsp;vehicle to contain&nbsp;two seats. The shape was pretty&nbsp;accurate&nbsp;too. The minifigs are the Joker, a henchman and Batman. I was hoping for Heath Ledger Joker but you get the same Joker from the Batwing (7782) and the same with the henchman too. The Batman however is new, the torso is based off the new film ""The Dark Knight"" but Lego couldn't rid of the white ""eyes"" and made the overall colour grey instead of black. This set is good but&nbsp;disappoints on some levels but at the same time it isn't their worst Batman set.&nbsp;Pick it up if want it, its useful&nbsp;</span>if you just like Batman or&nbsp;newcomers who hadn't the chance to get Joker the first time. But I&nbsp;recommend waiting for it to go&nbsp;on sale first.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,4,3,4,3
"water_jedi_17","2008-08-30T14:36:17.67Z","the tumbler vs joker's ice cream truck"," I was really impressed with this set after buying it at my lcal lego store. The tumbler has appeared in the two best films I've ever seen Batman Begins and the Dark Knight plus it comes with an ice cream truck that appeared in an episode of the recent batman animated series.
 The minifigs:the joker comes in his classic lookalthough my joker minifig seems to have darker eyebrows when compared to my joker key chain.He also comes with a bang
gun. We also recieve a henchmen which hasn't been seen since the first batman wave in 2006.
 Batman has an armored look like in the films and comes with three batrangs,two boomerangs that don't work and an odd pair of handcuffs.
 The ice cream truck:like two faces truck it has the same design on the wheels.it also comes with a blunt missle although you have to open the back doors or loosen the door pieces.It comes with a variety of stickers including
 I heart Gotham sticker,I Scream,venom sticker,three uncle joker's ice cream surprise sticker,and the names of the ice cream joker sells including soda smilex popsocle,ol'fashioned venom flavor,and rigor mortis soft ice
 
THe tumbler:for once this vehicle comes with two seats and various controls and computer plus steering wheel.unfotunately it doesn't come completely black and shows some blue and yellow pieces.the wheels are huge and are a little bit taller than a minifig.it also comes with a missle shooter and two reesigned flick fire missles.unfortunately it's missing some features I was hoping for
 jet engine in the back,batpod launcher,and side controls.

As a bonus I decided to review an alternate model using pieces from this set called the Joker's double scoop special. It is esentially a combo of the tumbler and the ice cream truck.It comes with two missles and two flick fire missles.the top ice cream cone always falls off and the front wheels are a bit unstable and I didn't like it myself.

"SaintElsewhere","2008-10-11T16:32:55.827Z","&quot;Does it come in black?&quot;","This set is my favourite of 2008. It comes with Batman, the Joker, a henchman, the Tumbler and ice cream truck, plus accessories. 
The ice cream truck is small and strange. It's not as good as the helicopter and it seems like the designers just cut corners and copied the design of Two-Face's armoured truck from '06. This earns 3/5.
The Tumbler on the other hand is arguably the best Bat-vehicle ever released. It's very bulky and faithful to the movies (&quot;Why so serious?&quot;) a well as being intricately designed and painstakingly detailed. 5/5.

Pros:
Tumbler takes a long time to build
ice cream truck is very campy and befitting of the Joker's MO
henchmen are finally making a comeback after being absent throughout '07 (they seriously could've added one to the Bat-tank set)

Tumbler is sweet, nice design and shape
Joker Van? Great addition to his helicopter (if you have it)

"AETerry","2011-05-17T14:16:52.23Z","Batman Tumber Review","<p>The entire Batman theme saw a renaissance for me with my love of LEGO, before this theme, I'd petered off somewhat and was far more picky about what sets I put my money down for. With many of the sets, it feels like it's flip flops with you're either going after the characters, mainly villians or the vehicles involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set I think works to the advantage of wanting it for both vehicles and villian characters. The Tumbler is based off the Tumbler seen in the Batman Begins movie and is a very good lego design likeness. It's just a solid tank-like build, very durable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joker's Icecream Truck is a delightful vehicle too, with a cannon that fires out the back and it's coloring, I've been tempted to use it as an actual Icecream truck in my Lego City going around. There's room in it for both minifigures of Joker and his henchman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So three minifigures.... Batman who can get a bit repetitive when you're collecting up all of the sets and find you've got multiples of him, regardless of what suit he's wearing. Joker is found in only one other set, but it's a matter of which vehicle set do you grab up first? The Henchman is good, makes for good cannon fodder and goons to battle Batman with. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And with all of the sets, Batman comes with a little poly bag filled with a variety of batman centric weapons and extras for villians to use with the tommy guns. Joker and his henchman also each have a translucent yellow popcicle they're holding. Joker has one of his gag weapons that pops out a flag reading bang on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's hard to say which of the vehicle sets are my favorite when there's so many of them that feature an iconic vehicle and design of Batman's from one era, comic or movie incarnation to another. I found myself in an easy mode of pick them all up.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
