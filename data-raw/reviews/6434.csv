"Gus_263","2008-05-23T17:07:40.857Z","The &quot;Orc&quot; warrior","This set is another small set of the current castle theme, is another &quot;impulse&quot; set. Like all the impulse, it have a decent price, but it is only due to the few pieces. The price is the better thing, but this set isn't good as it could be. 

The minifigure included is a troll (maybe a try to make an Lego orc from the LOTR), with the common minifigure shape, but with no much nice designs. The body have confuse printed designs and also a color scheme with so much differences, some few gray and black details combined with the brown and green schemes. Good colors, but the green could be more darker and it could have less details, like some classic castle minifigures. The troll's face is silly, it have two red eyes and a mouth showing some teeth, it could be better designed, with some more likeness with an orc. The minifigure also have a helmet, different from some of the classic lego castle helmets. This is a silver one (bad color, the black could be better), and the shape make some details stay hidden in the color, it isn't much useful like the old helmets (some old helmets still being used with knights, but no with these trolls). The troll also have a sword, different from any sword ever made. Cool in the shape, but with a bad size, it looks like to be bigger than the knight's classic swords (some with the original shape). The troll don't have any shield, it could be an addition to this.

A piece included with the set is the rat, called as the &quot;pet rat of the troll&quot;, but it is silly. The rat isn't bad, due to the simple details, but due to the size, color (it isn't gray or white). The rat isn't a problem to the set, but another creature could increase the set, more than a rat.

The cart included is small, like some other carts from the theme. The pieces are also useful, but the stick used on the &quot;cannon&quot; makes it looks like a missile. The building is basic, of course, but the wheels of the cart and the plate among these are really useful. These pieces used on the cart are all useful, but the building make some problems on the design, like in the arrow, and in the brick made to hang it. To launch the arrow, you need only push it to the front, is easy to launch and sometimes it can be launched in a decent distance. The cart is also increased with two spears, but don't have a great distance to attack, are just to increase it.

Overall, this set is cheap, but it could be more increased, with another creature, not a rat only, and the building of the cart could be more complete, with other pieces, like the old cannon balls, or a arrow, it could be a crossbow, and not a missile (missile because it is also used with some Star Wars space ships, as weapons). And also, the old knights were very better (in the simple design and were more usable due to the simple color schemes, common colors)than this troll. So, this set gets a 3,3 of 5, in comparison with some sets with an aproximated number of pieces. Cheap, but not good as it could be.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"asianlego","2008-09-25T08:23:58.31Z","Grunt! Attack de castle!","I got two of these sets so I would have a couple of trolls attacking my Lego fortress. It was pretty nice, the troll is like a shrunk version of Lego Harry Potter's troll except with more detail. The new rugged scimitar is a nice design but it looks very plasticky. The small wagon has a tiny cannon that looks too modern for the age that trolls live in. The new helmet shapes is extremely detailed as well, but it looked very much like those of Mega Bloks medieval series. Extra accessories included in the set are two spears and mouse. Why they put in a mouse I am not sure, but I appreciate it as I've never had a Lego mouse before. This set is great for expanding your evil minions.

"JohnnyB87","2008-09-15T21:53:32.64Z","Give it a chance...","The 2008 Castle lineup has a good amount of impulse sets, which are very nice to either lure someone into the Castle theme or just to build up one's army, whether that army fights for the forces of good or evil.

Troll Warrior is actually not that bad of an impulse set, to say the least. Time to break it down:

This set comes packaged with a troll with the standard printed torso. I would've preferred a more unique print, but it does the job. He is armed with his pearl silver sword and the silver-speckled helmet. Definitely nothing new here, but without this set, building up a troll army would become rather costly.

Next up is the rat. His height comes up to a minifig's thighs and his body is as long as two minifig legs. His tail is a squiggle that looks to be the same size as the length of his body. His face is fairly detailed, containing a snout, two eyes, and two pointed ears that end up making him look adorable. Too bad trolls eat rats for dinner...

Onto the ballista type siege weapon, which seem to have invaded and conquered the Castle theme as ballistic type weapons are everywhere. It contains two ordinary wagon wheels, two spears that clip at the sides, and the newer flick-fire missile that doesn't fall out on its own. I would've liked the wheels to be about 66% of the current size to create a better proportion as this is a one manned mobile siege weapon after all.

No significant pieces are included other than the troll and rat. If LEGO included one of the rectangle troll shields, this set would be amazing.

Still, I feel this set is definitely worth picking up at least one of as it contains the basics and having another troll and rat are always welcomed additions.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"the_lead_general","2008-11-23T21:22:30.09Z","Great set","Troll warrior
 
Plus+
     It has a troll with a sword who doesn't have the strange helmet of the Dwarves mine or a common bronze sword. It comes with a rat which will be great if it comes in almost every troll set. I like how the rat's tail curves around Lego studs. The catapult is good and has spears attached to the sides of it. 

Minus-
      The catapult has a too high angle of incline and shoots over targets. The flick fire system only works by flicking, pushing sends it ground-ward. He could come with a shield but that would add to the cost or remove an item from the set to keep it at the same price. It only comes with the shown one ammo.

Equals=
       Yet again Lego have pulled off a good impulse set with good value for money, new pieces (or special ones), and great playability.

Compatibility
             This set goes great as a backup to any heavy troll artillery. Two fit inside the Troll warship and it goes great there. A truly great attachment or impulse set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"HawkUnit","2009-02-25T00:44:35.42Z","Affordable set with good pieces..."," This is a pretty cool set for an impulse set. It comes with a troll (or an orc, which ever one you prefer..), a rat, and a missile wagon. The wagon is a pretty good design. It has a flick-fire launcher which I can't get enough of! It has 2 spears on the sides and it has a piece where the troll\orc can hold the wagon. The wagon has a bunch of good pieces for customization.The orc \troll is really cool. It has a neat helmet, good torso designs, brown and grey colored legs, and an oversized sword which is awesome.

Pros: 1.Awesome troll\orc
        2.Neat wagon with good pieces
        3.A little rat
        4.Set is affordable for anyone

Cons: None, really",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lint","2009-03-18T09:00:51.327Z","Pretty ordinary","Pros

A troll!
A rat!
A troll sword

Cons
You dont really get that much else.


Unless you were really coveting this set for the wheeled flickfire artillerypiece this set doesn't really have much to offer. Other LEGO impulse sets generally give you a more accessoried minifig with rarer special pieces or a decent vehicle. This sort of tries to give you both with the flickfire cannon and the rat but ultimately dissapoints.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Harmonious_Building","2012-01-26T20:11:41.79Z","Troll on a roll.","<div>I am a tremendous fan of Castle sets in general, but I am always particularly enamoured by sets featuring the “evil” faction, possibly due to the fact that I have been accused of being evil myself on a number of occasions. And of all the evil factions that have existed thus far, I love the Trolls the most of all and can’t quite understand the scorn that they receive (as in, more scorn than they would receive just for being Trolls). To me, they are an utterly unique faction with an aesthetic that is both coherent and unlike anything that Castle had seen before their introduction, and I find that hard to beat.</div><div><br></div><div>Given the paucity of Trolls on the market nowadays, Troll Warrior is indeed your blessing if you’re looking to augment your Troll faction, or even if you are just starting one out. The standard Troll grunt is armed with one of those large, rough-looking swords, and the flick-fire ballista is about as nice a build that you can hope to get for under twenty pieces, a design that was, oddly enough, recycled a few years later for Escape from the Dragon’s Prison (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7187-1"">7187</a>) but belonging to the good faction, for some reason. Anyway, the front-pointing spears are menacing enough, useful tools with which one might impale hapless do-gooders.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you are a Castle fan looking for something different and have a chance to pick this up for (relatively) cheap, I would definitely recommend Troll Warrior as a starting point for constructing a fully-fledged Troll faction.
