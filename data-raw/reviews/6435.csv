"YellowedWhitePieces","2008-05-24T23:43:51.153Z","Good, but not great.","This is a nice model that has great lines and the working convertible roof is a plus.  The back end is a little strange-looking, but is worth it for the movable top.  The car looks great with the down AND up.  The color scheme is very nice with the dark red/maroon stripes, but it seems a bit strange that the seats are the pale blue.  I think a better choice would have been red or overall black.  The use of the Minifig Samurai swords for the windshield wipers is very clever and it looks quite convincing.  The hood opens and the V-8 engine fills the engine bay nicely.  There's even a radiator fan (but no radiator!).  There are movable side view mirrors and a rear view mirror hangs from the top pf the windshield frame (but with the back end of the car obscuring any view to the rear, this seems superfluous!  

The cockpit interior is a bit of a letdown.  A natural comparison of this car in this area must be with the 4896 set, Roaring Roadsters.  The convertible has a gear shift and even a wiper control arm next to the steering wheel, but there are no foot pedals.  Door pockets are nice, but a parking brake would look better.  However, the space is a bit tighter so that might not have been practical.  The biggest knock against the interior is that the passenger area footwell is open to the engine bay in front and also to the &quot;trunk&quot; space in the rear, behind the seats.  The openings in the footwell and behind the seats really need to be filled with some bricks.  If you have some extra white or gray pieces from a Basic or other parts set, use them here!

The front wheels do not steer, but that isn't a big deal.  It's difficult to see how that could have been done without getting in the way of the opening hood or working roof.  It should be possible for resourceful modders to make the front wheels at least pivot, but it will require some slight redesign under the engine.

Pros:  Nice looking car and colors.

Cons: Incomplete interior.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"darthdc","2009-09-03T12:11:12.513Z","Really is Cool Convertable","This is a great set - and fairly big too. 

The whole look of the car is what attracted me to this set in the first place. As other posts have stated, this does have a design similar to the AC Cobra. The colour scheme is perfect - the dark red sets off great against the white.

The doors are nicely done with the hinges nicely hidden and the glove compartments are a nice touch too. 

The interior features nicely designed seats though dark red might have been better than blue. The dashboard can be easily reversed to make the car a right hand drive (I do this whenever possible on all sets) The lever between the seats is either the gear stick or hand brake (the latter most likely, but the wrong way round). 

The roof is cleverly done, and is by far the best feature, even though they could have used a few more white pieces to make the back more presentable.
The engine is well done and looks good under the bonnet.

The secondary models are OK. The Payloader is the better - only because of the working arms. The truck cab requires two instruction books but only has opening doors for features.

Pros

Nice design, loads of cool bricks
Large size (13.5cm wide and 28cm long)
No stickers

Cons

Windscreen is easily misshaped
No steering - maybe possible with modification to chassis
Nicely priced at £35


The front wheels may be made to steer, even through the steering wheel - by altering the chassis at the front. The wheel arches are slightly bigger than those at the rear and will allow for the wheels to turn.

We get plenty of white wedges and archs but not so many plates (they're too common). Also some black archs and slopes, and some useful tiles in dark red and medium blue. Don't forget the big wheels.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, the first model is the convertible. It's very good looking, a little cartoonish but it's part of its charm. The front is terrific, just like the sides (around the doors). The back is not as nice, most of it is a plate because of the roof function. Yeah, it has a really clever mechanism for the convertible roof.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Then we get instructions for a truck, it's big as the oficial description says (like the convertible, both are bigger than expected). It uses most of the pieces available, the interior isn't as fancy as the convertible. The front is really cool, the archs are nice here. The cabin can tilt and you can see the v8 motor wich is better-looking than the one in the convertible.</div><div><br></div><div>The last one is a loader, it doesn't use a lot of the available pieces but is nice as well. The shovel is clever and it does what it has to do.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now, overall we're getting some big and great looking models but they're not perfect. There isn't a lot to do with these, we don't have steering, wich is the most notorious flaw of the set. But the functions, like the convertible roof, tilting cabin, openable doors etc. kind of makes it up for it. And don't forget the great piece selection included for a fair price (back in 2008 it retailed for US$ 49.99).</div><div><br></div><div>Now, the set gets a 4.5/5 from me. I recommend the set if you can still find it.</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5
"Techman","2012-06-17T16:33:30.457Z","Nice car from Creator","The set has a lot of white elements and arches to give a sleek profile. I appreciate that because it actually makes the car look reasonable. The inside of the car is relatively hollow and empty except for the few bricks that support the top shell and side. The coolest feature is the retractable roof that folds into the back of the car. This is fun to play with and observe how it works. I spent a while examining how the liftarms fold and bend to pull the roof back. The doors open and hood opens too. I wish the car had steering in the wheels like creators earlier car #4896. While I don't own that car, it has been an eye catcher. This set has an intake on the hood and nice curves on the front which are nice. I personally made changes to mine and added my own details to it. You could add rims and such to it for a better look. The cool convertible now sits beside my 8070 super car and it is much smaller. The look is good for display, but you can only do so much with the features. That's why for a reasonable price it's good for the pieces and just displaying. The set offers an intriguing mechanism for the roof and other ideas. Other booklets are provided to make a front loader and truck. I purchased mine for half price on a discount a while back where it was a two for one deal. Even still, this set packs a lot of new ideas for how to design a car with all the new parts lego introduced. I think this set is worth it for the pieces and appeal.",FALSE,4,4,4,3,4
"Mr__BananaHead","2019-04-25T18:18:33.283Z","Nostalgia","<p>While the name of this set isn&#39;t the most creative, this set is very nice for its time. This set has a lot of nostalgia for me, as it was one of the very first large sets I wanted. I received it for Christmas from my grandmother when I was very young. The build has nice sleek features, though the back shows a good bit of studs. The doors open to a 45&deg; angle, and the hood opens to show a somewhat detailed engine. It has a nice dashboard and the seats are studless and nice-looking. The main convertible feature worked very smoothly and is very satisfying to watch. The terrible thing that breaks my heart is that the reddish-brown peices break very easily. I have five broken peices from this set and I will have to replace them. Brown peices are terrible. But other than that, this set is very good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
