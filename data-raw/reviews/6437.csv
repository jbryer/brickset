great set but when i put the T-Rex together i found i was lacking five pieces.
found them in my spares box.
love the colours. Yellow with the green looks great. The eyes light up very well and the mouth looks cool open or closed.
The tail sways from side to side as you play and the scale is just right for minifigs. this ones going in my city scene. lol

I love the colours in this set.  The greens, yellow and brown bricks look awesome together.  

This was my first Creator set, and it has ignited my interest in this theme.  The designers have been give the license to try out more interesting techniques and this is to the benefit of the models.

The Steg is fun, and makes a great toy once it has been built.  There are some loose pieces, like the yellow spikes on the spine, however it is fairly robust.  The legs are not fantastically interesting to build, but are a good lesson in stability.

The T-Rex is ok, but considerably smaller than the Steg.  

I've not tried the other model.

Good play value.  I highly recommend the model.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Unknown_User2596","2009-08-07T18:38:24.513Z","4998 Stegosaurus","Here are the pros and cons for this set (or rather, the main model and the two other sub models):

Main Model (Stegosaurus):
Pros:
-flexible (especally the main torso)
-great design
-Accurate to the real thing
-has some great pieces in rarer colors (Dark green slopes, GITD eyes, etc)
-PF light makes the stegosaurus look like its using laser vision, which is cool

Cons:
-Tail looks odd
-Can't stand up
- neck joint can only turn side to side
-the yellow cheese slopes look out of place

Overall rating: 9/10
The best out of the three models- great build and the final product looks better in person.

Sub modea #1 (T rex)
Pros:
-very accurate
-arms +legs have great flexibilty
-solid design

Cons:
-Wayyyy smaller then originally anticipated
-again, head can only turn side to side
-color usage is a little all over the place
-mouth is utterly useless and thus it can't eat anything
-Whithin the instruction booklet I found an building error. By the time you build the right leg you would use up all of your green 1x4 plates- but the instructions ask for another one for the leg assembly(But you can replace it with 1x2 plates). Why the designers didn't catch this problem I'll never know...
-Tons of pieces left over

Overall rating: 5/10
Disappointing. It looked better in the pictures...

Sub Model #2 (flying dinosaur)
Pros:
-big
-the wings acually have depth in them (they used acual bricks in the wing design)
-fun to swosh around (and attack other aircraft) with 
-Like the stegosaurus, PF light turns this model into a laser vision-weilding dinosaur

Cons:
-not as flexicle as the others
-lots of pieces left over (but not as many as the T-rex)
-mouth useless for holding/eating
-build is rather short

Overall rating: 7.9/10
Originally this one looked horrible when I first saw it, but after building it, its growing on me...


Overall overall rating: 9/10
Definately recommended to any LEGO fan!
