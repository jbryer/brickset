This set are close to 70% compare with the real F2007, but this is a LEGO and consider very well build up model. Beside than the Technic F1, this consider are the bigest F1 ever.

I like it easy to build and following by the numbering, only an issue that I'm really not happy which is the sticker that are not protected. First I believe everyone have facing the issue is that when you open the box the sticker have been tear off or either fold together. it should be pack together nicely with the manual book to avoid any damage, anyway I think everyone of you have experience for this and really hope one day LEGO will improve for this.

Other than this I don't have any complain, it's nice F1 car ever build by the bricks. The other which is the driver name to be stick behind of the cockpit are not last, due to the surface are curve and it require you to press longer, if not the sticker will be always tear off. Beside if there can provide with the Barcode for the Marlboro sticker will be much more better, off course I understand due to the reason that all the cigarettes are ban and that's why there replace by barcode and wish the barcode can be provided by LEGO in near future.

Pro:
-Great size of F1 car
-Easy build with numbering
-Look great
-Many sponsors sticker, if you like sticker
-Really turn the wheel with the steering, no more hand of god.

Cons:
-Sticker easily to tear apart.

Overall I will give it 5, really not much complain about this.
Thanks for viewing!

"SpeedRaxar","2008-10-26T11:16:49.06Z","Great Display Set but quite fragile for play","Being an owner of another Ferrari (8145), I think I can give a fair review of this set. A quick comment is that this set is great for display, but with limited playability, and is rather fragile, especially at the mid section, I would recommend getting a few extra red plates to strengthen it.<br><br>The set is composed of 5 bags of parts, and you can build bag by bag without the need to open all bags. I actually spread the building time over a month due to heavy workload. This set is very easy to build compared to 8145, which was very tough, but in return of tough building, 8145 provides an engine with moving pistons and many movable components. This set has few surprise in that aspect except wheel steering.<br><br>But when it comes to display, 8157 stands out significantly, F1 itself in nature is great already, and the size of this unit is much bigger than I expected,&nbsp;<br><br>I am not going to complain about stickers anymore as Lego does not seem to be changing this, just hope that they can pack the stickers and manual in a better way so that they won't come in messy shape.",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"jamal_lts","2009-09-22T23:57:12.403Z","The Static Racer","This set is certainly meant for the display case. Although i tried moving it around, the steering is simply to cramped inside to play with. 

The overall details however are superb! The wheel to car ratio is accurately proportioned. 

Compared to the technic version released 2 years back, this F1 has a more solid and LEGO feel to it. I had it place under a spotlight and the view from the angle is fantastic. Excellent.

The side mirrors however should have been replaced with the ones they used for the GTB Fiorano. The ones in this set keep dropping off and doesn't add to the aerodynamics of the F1.

Bottom line... this is a beautifully designed model and an accurate representation of a F1 racer.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

(B4 saying this review isn't helpfull, check out the full review)

Here is the closing of that review:

Features
This is very much a static build. No minifig can jump in and drive off in this set. The wheels rotate, steering works and rear wing is removable. Weighs like a ton and feels very solid. Only things that really break off when I was moving it around is the side view mirrors and the rear spoiler. Since they have the Ferrari license, they could add all the prancing horse logos and all the sponsor's logos.

My rating:
Playability: 1 out of 5. It is pose able. That's it. It's a display. I wouldn't mind putting this under a display case if I had one big enough just to keep the dust off of it.
Design: 5 out of 5. Not much they could've done. Maybe put shocks or add a detailed engine. But what they did do was keep all the aerodynamic curves on the racer.
Build experience: 4 out of 5. When comparing to other ""racers"" series sets, it was one of the hardest to put together. As a Lego set in general, anybody who could follow instructions well can make this set. There was nothing complicated. 
Overall: 4 out of 5. At $69.98 it's a good deal. For red parts or as a Ferrari lover. I believe this set is going on clearance to remove from inventory. So buy now if you want it.

But when I start to build it, I was surprised when it didn't was a Technic kind of Racers, like 8145 (fiorano), 8386 (-04 F1), 8653 (enzo), 8674 (-06 F1). Didn't checked it out carefully because it was cheap. 
It's a classic brick construction, except for the steering, which is technic. And as classic brick construction it took only 2½ hours to build and now it's in the display case.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I started to find out what's on the market nowadays and saw this set displayed on Lego world 2009 in the Netherlands.<div><br></div><div>Decided to buy by it and I am all happy with it. This is the first set I bought in maybe 20 years or so. Although I like some of the new, technic models out there, wanted to first buy and try if I like this (more old style Lego set). It is a very nice large, brick model of a Formula 1 car.</div><div><br></div><div>I much like it, the build is nice because it takes some time, and I was just amazed by the size, as I am not used to such big Lego sets.</div><div><br></div><div>1 thing I really miss though, is the engine.</div><div><br></div><div>....but that's why I bought a second hand Williams F1 and Ferrari both in scale 1:8 to expericence the 'new' way too...</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, I like this set and will definitely keep it (also because I have some plans for builds with red parts...).</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-22T12:35:03.927Z","LEGO Racers (Ferrari) - Ferrari F1 1:9 Review","When I got this set, this set was my largest LEGO set I have before I got the Eiffel Tower and the Tower Bridge set. The whole car took me about 3 hours to build and it was a lot of fun. The bags are numbered for an easy build. I also like the sticker details with the sponsors and we also get a sticker for the drivers Felipe Massa and Kimi Räikkönen.<br><br>As a huge formula 1 fan I can't complain about the attention to detail. This set doesn't include a minifig and it's a lot bigger than a regular minifig. Also a LEGO Technic minifig doesn't fit in this cockpit. The rear wing on the back is a little bit flimsy so be careful if you want to pick up this car. But the other parts of the vehivle are very sturdy and you can also take off the wing on the front. I'm sure this will be a rare set in 10 years so I recommend you to buy this one. This set is more a model for display than a toy to play with. I really hope that LEGO does a formula 1 theme in the future with all teams, drivers and race tracks since 1950.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
