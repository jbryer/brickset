It was a value pack though, so seriously it isn't that big of a deal.  The peices are great for reusing.  The rocket in the back is really cool and so are the flip up wings.  Overall there isn't much to be said besides look at the picture and decide for yourself if you think that it's worth buying.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>As my cusions and I recieved this in the value pack when we were young.&nbsp; It has survived many of battles and tosses into the lego box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gave a 4/5 for overall.&nbsp; When I was younger the set was awesome.&nbsp; Now that I am older, it still holds some awe, but the other blacktron ships are better.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the Pulsar Charger for MTron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Far as Building it was quick and easy to build to get me to play time.&nbsp; Which is good for a kid, but bad as someone who wants a challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decent parts and playability was pretty much just a attack craft and maybe putting around the stars so to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great little set.&nbsp; A handful of these could give any other space faction a run for their money.&nbsp; Quick and agile.&nbsp; One weapon that I can see, some sort of Pulse energy weapon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need some support for your blacktron, this is a good little find!</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,3
"BelgianBricker","2019-07-08T11:03:20.457Z","More then meets the eye","<p>&quot;Blacktron&quot; will always be one of my favorite LEGO-space themes. Where the &quot;message intercept base&quot; and the &quot;renegade&quot; form the first wave still stand out as the best in their league, the &quot;next generation&quot; wave wasn&#39;t all that bad either. Sure, the minifigs were a big let down, print-wise, but some of the best spaceships, in my humble opinion, where assigned to these smiling bad guys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This little one-seater is no exception. What makes this small spaceship so great, is that it aks only a little, but offers a lot:</p>

<p>We get a&nbsp;nice printed Blacktron control-tile;&nbsp;great parts like the wings, hinges, seat, rocket,...; a&nbsp;beautiful design: the spaceship is sleek and comes&nbsp;with adjustable wings;&nbsp;a bunch of trans-neon parts and we even get a minifig accessory in the form of a vintage walkie-talkie.</p>

<p>From the pictures, it might not look like much, but there is definitely more then meets the eye.</p>

<p>So there aren&#39;t any bad things? Sure there are: from a design perspective, the ship doesn&#39;t fit in well with the overall &quot;Blacktron-next generation&quot; style of ships. The color-scheme is there, but that&#39;s about it. Many other small &quot;Blacktron&quot; space-ships suffered form this problem however. The hinges will also loose their &quot;grip&quot; over time, making the wings angle downwards all the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, this tiny ship is a gem. A great design form a great space-theme, and I will treasure it forever.&nbsp;</p>
