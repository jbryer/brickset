Another welcome addition to my ever growing construction crew. Set is cheap to buy and has character, I like it and imagine it will be hard to find in a few years. Recommend adding this and most of the inexpensive 2008 City sets currently available.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-09-02T09:11:29.153Z","C-L-E-A-N!","Well, you can't say much about an impulse set, so let's go to the point.
Pros:
Nice brush
A good minifig
Unique garbage can
Useable if you want to make a large-scaled city
No stickers
Quite cheap
Cons:
Small cart
They only give you 4 pieces of 'garbage'

So, buy this set if you want to expand your collection or if you want to make a large city.

"MatrixQuest","2008-10-24T01:39:18.373Z","Used in construction prep...","This is an awesome small set except for the limited size per cost ratio...just a few years ago this would have been in a bag for under 2 bucks US or as a meal box promo...now Lego wants 3.5 and many retailers are selling it for $5 after putting it in a box.  
These &quot;street cleaners&quot; are real and are often used just before small paving jobs to clean both debris and for &quot;roughing&quot; the surface so the new layer will adhere and not slip on top of it.  I have it near set 5610 in my rather large city setup and it looks like they are fixing to fix the sidewalk.  (oh take some single row brown bricks to look like boards for the cement to be pored in.)  You get a shovel and broom to boot...if you don't already have more than you know what to do with.  You also get a trashcan...that any large city can't have too many of.  The &quot;sweeper&quot; itself looks nice for such a simple kit.  I like the light element on top as well as the shield guard to protect the mini-fig pushing it.
Mostly, I like the set cause it adds a new job for the construction mini-figs...(shovels, pick axes and jack-hammers look more like destruction, than construction).  So if you feel that your construction workers need more to do, get one of these guys to work in your town.  Then add 3 or 4 others standing around watching him work; just like those guys down the street...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-12-03T18:25:45.793Z","Construction Fan!","I really like what they are doing with the construction sets as of late.  I am hooked.  When I saw this little set, I had to have it.  I was dying to get my hands on the street sweeper, and now he has a sidekick.  It seems that everyone is in agreement that he is a sidewalk cleaner, and looks great right near my street sweeper.

The worker has a great face, though most of these guys do not seem to enjoy their work a whole lot.

If you have a city, you get another garbage can to add to a street corner.  It would be nice if LEGO would produce a new garbage can that is not in the fashion of the old tin cans that would be found in a back alley.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-05T08:37:15.763Z","Cleaner Cart","The set isn't that much so I didn't use it at all in my LEGO town (who needs this if they have the automatic Street Sweeper?). The cleaner has a bit more variant than in other themes (not too orangey). The set also includes a dustbin without a lid and a few black round 1x1 studs as garbage. You might want to avoid this one and get a Street Sweeper vehicle for only a few bucks more.

It is probably the only impulse set to have tecnic part with it but it works well, The brush part is coll and has a nice feel to it the minifigure is good and the garbage can is good.

"indykid","2009-01-03T04:18:02.233Z","Five as always","This set is pretty neat. I have cant ever remember buying a set under $10 before so I was surprised to find one piece of paper as the instructions. My set came with two extra pieces of 'garbage'(black 1x1 studs). I like the minifigure and the sweeper which is well put together. I also like the accessories (the garbage can, Broom, and shovel). Keep your LEGO streets clean with this set and you dont always have to strain to find the bulky, hard to find, little bit more expensive Street Sweeper. theis worker hs a cooler face than the street sweeper minifig anyway. now i can keep my lego town clean and start to make a 'green' Lego town. :)   I highly reccommend this set to anyone.

Compare it with set 5611, which has a handheld cart, a trash can AND an orange container I'm going to assume is for recycling... in this set, the trash can doesn't even have a lid.

I'm sorry, I just can't see this set as being good value for money. Maybe if the sweeper was slightly more elaborate? It could have racer-type mudguards instead of the flag, and bars on both sides. I can't give this set any more than a three.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The actual street cleaner thing is nice too. It also comes with a trash can, a push broom, and a shovel, as well as some small black 1x1 round pieces which serve as trash.

"AETerry","2010-09-07T15:51:08.69Z","Street Cleaner Review","<div class=""description""><p>This is a great little set and one of several small sets I spotted
 at Christmas time and bought for myself. If you've got the Town/City 
sets, this is a great, if not perfect addition to it.</p>

<p>It's just a great little accent set to a larger Town/City collection. My construction theme/set collection is a little on the weak side 
still, but this helps to push in that direction of being better. 
Hopefully not an after thought.</p></div><p>
</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are printed on either side of a folded sheet of paper with clear step-by-step illustrations.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 22 pieces to this set. Most notable is the blue ""rounded brush"" piece that forms the main feature of the Street Cleaner's mobile sweeper.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>For a set this size, you only have one minifigure, that of the construction worker who's working as the Street Sweeper. He features a head with brown beard and glasses, red hard hat and the orange coveralls for his trade and profession.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>Given the relative size of this set, it comes across as very simple and easy to build. As stated before, once you're done, you've got a great accent piece for a busy LEGO Town or City with some one either cleaning the streets in general or clean up after a construction job.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>On it's own, it may not seem like much, but it works great in part of a larger collection and display. And at roughly $3.49 for the set, I'd say this was well worth it. Eventually at some point I hope to either find an older Street Cleaner Vehicle or wait for LEGO to put out a newer model to get a hold of.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5

"Harmonious_Building","2012-07-13T09:20:02.33Z","Good, clean fun. ","<p>If the brutally oppressive police force is LEGO City's single largest employer, then its public works department must surely be second. And if you need a guy to wipe off the blood and entrails from the streets after the latest incident of ""justified use of deadly force"" against the civilian populace, then Street Cleaner is your man. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a very small set indeed, and what you see is what you get: our heroic Street Cleaner, his super-cool street sweeper, and some odds and ends (loose black studs for ""dirt"", a trash can, a broom, and a shovel). For some reason, I had a devil of a time finding this set for a reasonable price, but I was finally able to snag it off of BrickLink for the suggested retail price of US$3.50, and I immediately fell in love with it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's generally difficult to see such small sets as anything else but part of a larger framework, and, as others have mentioned, it's more likely than not that you'll want to have at least a few of the larger City sets so that this guy doesn't seem like he's chasing windmills by cleaning a vast expanse of nothingness. On the other hand, it's hard to not get obsessed with the not-particularly-easy-to-come-by blue brush piece, whose tactility is very satisfying and may perhaps indicate that I have some sort of psychological problem. That aside, the Technic pieces and hinges make the sweeper surprisingly posable, which is not something I would have guessed just by looking at the picture. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you can't find this set for a reasonable price, I imagine that since the sweeper itself is made out of roughly ten pieces or so, with many of them being relatively common with the exception of the brush, you could probably hunt around and recreate this for yourself as a little project. And since you can never have&nbsp;a large enough LEGO cleaning crew to keep the city spotless, I'm sure you'll end up loving this tiny set as much as I do. What a pity that&nbsp;he's not able to literally clean our LEGO displays for us. </p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,4
"Minifig290","2018-08-16T15:33:08.09Z","NEED MORE OF THESE","<p>It my Second Throwback Thursday today i&rsquo;m going to look at another city set from 2007 retailing &pound;2.49 or $4 with 22 parts (prices per parts is 11p or 18c) It is the 5620 Road Sweeper. This small accessory set has a figure, bin, utensils, Rubbish and obviously a&nbsp;sweeper&nbsp;.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A simple construction worker with a common male face a red work hat and a orange construction shirt and boring unprinted pants</p>

<p><b>Minor Builds</b></p>

<p>Or accessories what ever you&rsquo;d call these, There&rsquo;s a common green garbage bin with a shovel and brown classic broom. Also a few black studs to represent some rubbish or dirt</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The small simple build is a great build for just &pound;2.49, There are two handles for the figure to hold the sweeper, there&rsquo;s a cool rotating blue brush at the front that has flexible brush picks with a yellow flag part covering the sweeper and some other minor parts keep it together.</p>

<p>______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>A great price for a lovely little build that works wonders. I got mine from &nbsp;my old Entertainer toy shop ,that closed and moved,&nbsp;for just &pound;2 on a special offer along side a old police helicopter from the same year.</p>
