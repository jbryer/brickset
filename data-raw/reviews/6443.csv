"DevDevBeck","2009-01-05T19:22:57.747Z","What an amazing set!","    4210 is the largest set I got for Christmas last year, and it has me amazed. The Coast Guard Platform includes a helicopter that in my opinion is an interesting little edition to the set. the helicopter has a visor, a tail, some rotors and a stretcher. There are two probles with the Helicopter, however. The first one is that, yes, it is rather small, but how big can you really make it? My other problem is about the strecher. Come on LEGO! Nobody wants to be airlifted on the OUTSIDE of this helicopter.
    The main part of this set is the coast guard platform. It includes A crane, a boat, Two lifts (one for the boat & one for the Helicopter), a hospital, a control center, a helicopter, and an complex underside. 
     The crane is built to haul the boat out of the water and back onto it's lift. In my opinion, the crane's support system works well, but LEGO could have done better job with that.
     Next to the crane is a boat that is very similar to the one on 7739, but this one has a flag. 
     Behind the crane complex is a hospital that comes complete with a bed, 2 chairs and a TV Monitor. 
     On the floor above the hospital, there is the main command center. The command center includes the same disadvantages as 7739, like the loose floor piece, but this center has a computer. Outside (how do you get outside without a door?) There is a platform used for viewing operations on the deck, and for observing the surrounding area.
     There are two lifts on this set. one is clearly visible, using a 2X4 Brick with notches to hold it up. This lift is the one used for the boat. There is another lift on the other side, holding up the Helipad. Some of you may not call it a lift, but I call it a collapsable launchpad.
     The last portion of the set is the underside. This haas steel girders holding up the rest of the platform. There are also numerous accesories down there such as 2 life preservers, 2 fire extinguishers and a buoy.
     This is a truly eye popping set! Don't let the pictures fool you. this set is massive, and attractive. Remember, This is a LIMITED EDITION SET so it won't be on store shelves for very long. 
     Well, a guess that's it. I hope my review has been helpful.
Thanks for readin'

"patch","2010-02-27T15:25:18.327Z","stability!","<p>hi everyone! this is my first review.</p>
<p>this set has 3 main parts, the supports,the base, and the helipad &amp; helicopter</p>
<p>the supports:Very poor indeed,using huge one piece legs joined to a 2 piece frame that;</p>
<ul>
    <li>can't be used to make much else</li>
    <li>are unstable</li>
    <li>don't connect properly</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The base:quite good,includes 2 seats, control room, railing,&nbsp;sattelite dish, crane and boat.The boat is a simple one piece vessel with an engine, and could've included some rescue gear.THE bottom floor should have at least a surgery department, but only has 2 seats and a wierd computer on a stick! However, the top floor is o.k.the crane is alright, but needs a better support system.</p>
<p>the helicopter is probably the only good thing in this set! it has cool rotors, a stretcher, and it locks onto the helipad!the helipad also has a cool monorail leading up to it!</p>
<p>this set has 4 coast guard minifigs and a patient</p>
<p>overall, i think this set could be much better, if i were you i would get the coast guard ship and tower.</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

"ALSTDA","2010-05-20T09:23:12.483Z","Not very good at all...","<p>Another review of mine that hasn&#39;t aged well... I don&#39;t get why I was so harsh either! As a TFOL, on 20/5/2010 I wrote:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bought this set for &pound;45 and what a waste it has turned out to be. The lighthouse set with the big boat would make a much a better set as it fits in and can be edited but this set can&#39;t be used for anything but what it was designed for. Mine is now all split up into different sets that I have created myself. Complete waste of money...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Buying LEGO is never a complete waste of money. Sure, now I wished I had saved towards the modular buildings&nbsp;of that day (Caf&eacute; Corner, Fire Brigade etc.)&nbsp;instead of splashing cash on sets like this that I&#39;ll probably never rebuild as the instructions suggest. However,&nbsp;I wish I had been a little more grateful that I could even buy LEGO in the first place!</p>

<p>This set is all action! A pretty cool helicopter, a unique platform design and a great colour scheme. The thing that is missing is another boat for the civilian to be rescued from. He looks like a fisherman and something along those lines would have been a great addition.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a classic parts set like the 3-1 Creator sets, but there is some good stuff in there. I&#39;ve made use of the plates, door and windows elsewhere but still not sure what do to with the giant orange trapezoid frames... Send me a message if you have tried or seen any cool ideas!</p>

<ul><li>A good build with no repetition.<br></li><li>Good figures.</li><li>Nice pieces.</li><li>Fun to play with.</li><li>Helicopter.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>More figs could have come in it.<br></li><li>Fragile supports.</li><li>Lacks detail.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>Overall a very good set to pick up and is worth it for a City. The cons on my list can be easily fixed, so it works out to be a great set.</p><p><br></p><p>Rating: 8/10<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"alva","2012-12-21T01:06:14.747Z","The Biggest Coast Guard Set","I love this Coast Guard line cause they are different from the standard Lego City subtheme such as Police and Fire Fighter. Their orange, blue, and white color combination is perfect and really stand out.<br><br>This set is really amazing. You can put it in the sea part of your Lego city, so your sea dont just filled with boats. It feel really like an oil rig. Super cool. And they have a lot of unique parts in this set.<br>Everything is OK with this set. You got 4 minifigure, you got <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">a </span>lot of <b>Dark Bluish Gray Support 2 x 2 x 10 Girder Triangular Vertical - Type
 3 - 3 Posts, 2 Sections</b> and you can use it in your MOCs that involved some raised plattform such as monorail, bridge, etc. <br>What I really like about this set is that it feels 3-D, with some depth,&nbsp; instead of just 2D feel like 7641 City Corner.<b> </b><font class=""fv""><br></font><br>What I dont like about this set is the use of part <b>Orange
 Support 31 x 13 Girder, Trapezoid</b> for the platform<b>. </b>It make the desain feels fragile and it can colapse anytime. If I can choose, I prefer to use standard plates or bricks for the platform. More solid.<br><br>This set also really playable. You have a crane for bringing the boat up and down, you got a heli with its own helipad, you got a control room, an emergency room, even its own patient minifig.<br><br>One thing I think strange is the design of the heli. How come you carry a
 patient by putting him on a strecher and plug it on the back of the 
heli and no cover at all? I think the patient will die cause of 
hypotermia:)<br>
<br>For city lover, I really recommend you to get this set. It will bring up your city level since your sea wont be just sea anymore. Combine it with the 5770 Creator Lighthouse, 4644 Marina, and 7994 or 4645 harbour and you have a sea that is really busy!<br><br><br><b><br></b><font class=""fv""></font><table class=""ta"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""3"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""100%""><tbody><tr bgcolor=""#ffffff""><td nowrap=""nowrap""><br></td><td><font class=""fv""><br></font></td></tr></tbody></table>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
