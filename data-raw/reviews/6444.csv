"asianlego","2008-09-25T08:15:46.7Z","Extreme Kayaking","I was prepared for the worst when I bought this set but it was actually quite nice! The kayak looks very pudgy from the bottom but it looks well done from the normal view. One more thing, in the picture above it shows the kayak and the man only but actually there is also a warning buoy with flag included in the set. If you like watersports or just want to have more variety in your city then you should get this, it's actually pretty decent!

"petro17sq","2008-10-03T15:48:04.403Z","Only Coast Guard Set","I liked the coast guard line since I first saw the pictures in Eurobricks some months ago. But at the moment I do not have the money to buy this theme, I am working in getting a lot of classic space set using e-bay.
I bought this impulse set because I wanted to have at least one of the coast guard sets.
The minifigure is very nice; I like the yellow lifesaver, the face with the cool blue sunglasses and the new helmet.
The kayak is nice, small and easy to build but it looks very nice.
The other accessory is ok, but nothing special.
I really like the instructions it have the number of each of the pieces, I guess that the Lego company put this just in case you want to order one of the pieces in the pick a brick webpage, and also the back of the instructions has a small catalogue with some of the coast guard sets and almost all the 2008 impulse sets (its remind me of the 80' and 90' catalogues).
Considering the small price I pay for this set I will give it a 5 out of 5.

"DVDWow","2008-11-11T15:28:30.623Z","A pretty good little set","There's not an awful lot to say about this set. At $3.49, you can't really expect too much. There are a lot of cool little things about it though:

- The color scheme - I'm really digging the Orange for Coast Guard sets, and this one is no different.
- Unique paddle - pretty cool
- Unique minifig - one of the cooler looking Coast Guard dudes
- Buoy too - While the picture above only shows the kayak, it also comes with a buoy.

Obviously, there's not a lot you can complain about, the only complaint I have is I guess the kayak is really simple (it took like 20 seconds to put together), but the rest of the extras are worth the impulse buy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"DevDevBeck","2009-01-04T17:17:48.59Z","Small, But Valuble To The Fleet","   I don't see why everyone is giving this set bad reviews becuase it is too small for them. Of course the set is miniscule... but how do you expect lego to make a giant kayak?
   Anyways... This set is an important edition to the coast guard fleet. It has 21 pieces, some rare orange bits, an oar, and a buoy, all for less than 5 Bucks.  I think it is a great add on to the coast guard theme.
   I would buy dozens of these if I could.... Then my fleet would be even larger.
Yes, it's true that LEGO could have added something else to this set, but how do you really add more to a 21 piece set?

"_obelix_","2009-01-09T12:19:28.857Z","Great CG Addition","I honesty don't see why all the bad marks!? Sure it is a small set, and it doesn't have many parts, but for its price its pretty neat. The minifig is one of the coolest Ive ever seen. Kayak is small and depicts the real one quite nicely. And last the buoy (which isn't on the picture above) is quite nicely done, simple and yet so realistic that, aside from the minifig, is really the best part of this set. I cannot see anything wrong with this set.

it's small but is a great addition to any lego collection, and a good starter set.

i love it.

"willow2323","2009-02-08T09:17:46.39Z","rip off","Pretty much an awful set. About 17 little bits for £2.49, rubbish. I only brought mine because I had £70 to spend from my savings and xmas + it was half price.

Pros: The minifigure has a cool face (liking the shades, Lego needs to do more), it is incredibly easy to put together.

Cons: Only floats for about 3 minutes, nowhere to put the life jacket, the flag thing dosn't float, the oar drags it down onto it's side in the water, stupid amount of play quality, not worth the money. 

This set is very boring on it's own, and their is not much to do with it. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone but a proffesianal collector.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Boidoh","2009-12-13T14:40:18.403Z","Nice Little Coast Guard Set","Pros-
1. Boat Can Float (ALSO A CON)
2. Coast Guard Minifigure WITH a life vest that covers his clothing that has a radio and a coast guard symbol.
3. buoy (i replaced the flag with a transparent piece so it can be buoy that guides boats cause when its night can u see a flag without a light, it would be a con if i didnt have the piece)

Cons-
1. Boat CANNOT float with the minifigure inside it.
2. NO STICKERS (atleast one with the coast guard symbol.

overall a 4/5. Just cause with the minifigure it turns side-ways. And no stickers. I wanted stickers. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-09-07T16:03:37.46Z","Coast Guard Kayak Review","<div class=""description""><p>This is one of several small sets that I saw in the aisle during Christmas time and picked up a bunch of them due to their price and as gifts to myself and stocking stuffers.</p>

</div>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are printed on a folded sheet of paper with LEGO's clear step-by-step illustrations.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 21 pieces in this set, most notable are the orange pieces for the top of the kayak and the pieces that make up the buoy.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There is only one minifigure in this set, that of a Coast Guard with a mostly Orange &amp; Blue uniform. He does wear one of the new style helmets, usually seen on Skater minifigures and a yellow life jacket.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4>You've basically two small builds in this set. One is the main feature of the kayak and I do like that. I get ideas of getting a hold of one of the raised base-plates or ones featuring a river and utilizing this in a MOC.<br>The other small build is that of the buoy, suggesting that this is for a coastal set.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As a small set, it's really not that bad, but it does end up being a bit
 of an ""orphan"" in my collection as I don't have more Coast Guard sets 
for it to go with. So I do alternate between I like this set and times 
wondering why I got it.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4
