"legofan5445","2008-07-05T00:09:59.06Z","Great Value!","This set is great! I just got it a few days ago is is just amazed by the size and value for this set!

Price: This set is a special promotional set i think, so it also has a great price for that 361 pieces !

Unimog Truck: Fierce and nice! It looks just so rugged and big enough to tackle any terrain! The truck dwarfs the minifigs! and the return of the classic door! Great attention to detail in the cabin, but missed out a sort of steps or ladder for the minifg to climb into the cabin, where the former trucks used to have. The rear was also quite simple, a huge piece with grills fixed on. 

Trailer: Trailer is great! Cool looking and working winch really works! Winch up or down the speedboat nicely! However, dont understand the two stands at the rear of the trailer that really jams up the loading and unloading of the speedboat. The wheel guards for the trailer is a new piece! Great looking!

Speedboat: Cool! However suffers a little juniorism from the hual, but it's important to keep the speedboat floating in water. (it really floats!) The twin motors are cool, but the shaft is a little too low to hit the water i think... Nice compartment to store the gears in at the front of the boat! 

Overall: Great looking truck! Nice and mean and ready for action! Good value too! Dont miss this set! IMHO, do get the kyak impulse set 5621 to increase a minifig to the team and the kyak fits nicely onto the rear of the truck! Nice~

I don't know where to begin - get it if you get the chance you won't regret having this one in you collection.  Alot of thought went into the design of this set, it is larger than you think - 14.5 inches long and 8 studs wide also tall due to the huge sand wheels on the truck. Comes with two different instruction books, it takes a while to put this one together. Tons of cleaver features in this model, like the double outboard motors that turn together. This set is a bit pricey but worth every dime. I would give it a 7 if possible, you will love this set!  Thanks Kids for a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Beren","2008-09-27T17:10:26.45Z","Awful scale!","OK, firstly I love the boat. I like the smaller RIB-style Lego boats and this one is just great. The trailer is also very good and if this was all that came with the set I would give it 5/5. However, there is a major problem with the scale of this set - the truck is completely wrong! Compare it to any of the other 2008 City truck sets (7733, 7990, 7743, 7991), which have the best Lego trucks ever and this is just awful. Yes, I appreciate that it's hard to have a robust, off-road style truck and still fit into minifig scale, but this one is a lemon.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"ogel646","2008-09-15T16:58:57.857Z","good set but a little expensive","In my opinion, this is a good set, and here are some details:

Advantages:
Good-looking truck which can contains two drivers 
New and large speed boat
Cool tools and wheels
It's a special edition

Disadvantages:
A little expensive which, actually I had considered a while before buying
Only two figures which is not enough for such a big set

Overall, if you want a big speed ship like this, you have no choice but buy it, otherwise it's nothing special and you can save your money to buy other sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"cbowers","2009-11-17T15:42:47.14Z","Decent","I love this truck/boat/trailer combo. You'll notice a 3 above. I had to ponder why I gave it such a low number. But I went with my gut...Like everyone said, this is a great idea. The truck is really fun to drive around on its bouncy huge tires. It is kinda wide though. Doesn't really fit in...the Heavy Hauler (Green Twin Dumper) is 8 wide and still skinnier than this thing... so that is noticable. I appreciate the style that lego is bringing to the table...but let's make comparable sets. 

Pros...actually pretty fun playbility. Two people can sit up front in the cabin. Lots of little compartments and wench. 

Cons....huge...boat thing...why one piece...not a fan of these floatable boats....in fact it just made me so upset, now I can't remember what else I don't like...oh yeah now I remember, the trailer comes unhitched all the time.

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T14:03:00.593Z","Where did it all go wrong?","Having collected the recent Coast Guard series, set 7726 was high on my list, but seriously, where did Lego go wrong with this set?   I think the design team had headaches on the day this was conceived!

Firstly, this set looks great as a display piece, which is where mine resides, on the coffee table.

As a Lego set which forms part of the Coast Guard series, it is a serious letdown.   It has been well-documented by previous reviewers, but why is this set so out of scale?   The truck is a very realistic take on the real thing, but itâ€™s far too big!   The trailer too is out of scale.   The Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB) is the only part of the set which could be combined with other sets from the Coast Guard series, and even then it looks big.   The RIB is beautifully decorated and adorned with plenty of accessories; the tower at the stern is realistic as are the twin antennae mounted high on the gantry.   A problem I have found with the RIB is that when the tower is moved into a raked back position, it becomes loose and eventually comes free from the model, very poor.

So to sum up, this set is great as a display piece but not as an addition to the Coast Guard Series.   I am glad that Lego only seem to have made this mistake once, the rest of the series is faultless. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
