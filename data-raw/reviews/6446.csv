"Legobuilderguy","2008-06-01T02:29:31.263Z","Good Little Set","Picked this set up at TRU a couple of days ago and am impressed. Nice little set, very much like the quad bike in #7743 but in the new coast guard color set. This also comes with of course the coast guard figure so this is an easy way to get a couple more coast guards for set #7739 the patrol boat. No pros and cons on this one as it's pretty straight forward and is a nice little quad bike. As a starter set for the new theme in Emergency Rescue I highly recommend this one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-06-23T22:15:21Z","Easy to build, good addition","This is a simple set that took less than a minute to build.  It is a good addition to the Coast Guard set.  A good &quot;Army Builder&quot; set to get more guards and able to move them around the beach.  I only wish it would have come with some hair or a cap.  It kind of limits the job of the driver.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Its definatly a good set dont get me wrong but it seems empty...Which is why i mod'd it as soon as i got home [It looks awesome!]

Pros: 

Nice Small size definatly geting your moneys worth
Cool Mini fig
Lots of Moding ability even though it doesnt look like it at first.

Cons: 

Looks wierd with the mudguards backwards in my Opinion.
Needs Moding In my opinion since it definatly lacks stuff [I added things so it can hold flippers &amp; a airtank + front lights and 2 orange lights so people can see it coming]         

Well definatly get this set if you are collecting this Coast Guard series heck buy more then one! If you want a better set for your CG i would recomend the CG 4WD &amp; Jet Ski its abit 3 times the $$ of this set but it comes with a Jet Ski + accesories.

Either way I reccomend this set but it needs moding which isant a problem for most people.

Which is why i give this a 3 out of 5.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-07-01T10:31:00.497Z","Good new set","This small set is a part of the current city theme and Coast Guard subtheme. Like the other sets from the same subtheme, this features colors like orange, blue, some black details and few yellow parts.

This set is really small, but features a decent building combined with a good design and so much useful pieces. The base is a plate and there are more small different plates increasing it. The wheels have a good size to it (are a quite bigger than expected, but as a coast guard car, it still very good), and with good tires also, in size, colors (white wheels and black tires) and playability.

The chassis is very simple, features orange pieces in each sides (front and back), these are common among the tiny turbos from the racers theme, but still better with this set. In the back, a white small plate connects a blue flag, just to add more stuff to it. In the front, there are two small white plates connecting the flashlight (it is just one small piece with a glowing yellow color) and direction to the quad bike.
The space for put the minifigure in the vehicle is really small, it could be a bit more big, but due to the building of the sides it still playable.

The minifigure is really common currently at many sets, and this is well detailed, with a blue helmet and a transparent visor.

At all, this small set looks like really simple (and is of course), but the pieces are useful, and the price worth the money (US$4.99), just if you serch for a basic stuff from the Coast Guard subtheme. But it could be a bit more increased, so it still with a 4,7 of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"donneyboy","2008-08-03T10:50:41.92Z","nice little set","i picked this one up at wal-mart last night and built it when i got home. it took me about 5 minutes to build it. you start off by building the under side then you build the top. it is a simple build, and you get orange fenders which you can get in the little racers sets, handle bars, a grey pole and a flag. 
pros- 
little
inexpensive
nice impulse set
nice figure
cons-
a little over priced
no other cones 
a nice 5/5 set",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"knuclear200x","2009-06-16T00:47:13.217Z","Tiny!","What we have here is a tiny, simple vehicle worth the price and has many potential uses. Uses include but aren't limited to simple army-building, race-track filler, precinct designators and escape vehicles for that giant lego truck/ship you might have.

It's hard for me to review this further in detail because it is so small and the picture pretty much forms your own opinion by itself.

No flaws in this one for what it is, but personally I feel the the front mudguard looks better facing the opposite direction.

Buy it I say.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"DevDevBeck","2009-06-09T23:47:28.39Z","Aah, Good Times...","The Lego Coast Guard Quad bike is a unique addition to a coast guard collection. It can be used in several instances, and it just looks cool when it is parked on the dock. (Or whatever you park it on).

The bike has four standard Tread tires, as ell as light Grey rims. There are two plastic panels, a Handlebar set, and a bright blue flag. I just think the flag needs a coast guard logo on it. There is a single light on the front of the bike, and a stick where you can attach some sort of towing vehicle. 

The Minifigure has a Blue helmet, a clear visor, a coast guard vest with a blue, long sleeve shirt underneath, and blue pants.

This set matches almost all other coast guard sets perfectly, and It can help the squad get out of some sticky situations, if it has to. If you can buy it, buy it. (Overall score: 5/5)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-22T08:28:28.81Z","Extreme Coast Guard Quadbike","I got this set for RM 22.90 ($6.40) and it's really nice. The quadbike has high playability by itself. But I had to make some improvements to the vehicle. First, the vehicle shape looks inside out (it is) so I turned it the other way round opposing the instructions. If you follow the normal instructions, you'll get a vehicle with an obvious blockish look. The flag also looks out of place on the quadbike, as it looks too big so I took one of the white jumper bricks and together with the flag, it would be placed on the ground. The headlights looks very weird protruding at the front, so I put two headlights (one is an extra piece) together so it looks much better. If you ask me how I put two into a single stud slot like in the picture, that is actually a jumper brick, and I have removed the jumper brick to place beneath the flag. Now you will receive a better realistic vehicle.

I wish they released this vehicle in other colors as well so I could have a quadbike race team.

"McDuff79","2009-06-10T06:21:00.043Z","Perfect for Pocket Change.","Hey. Grabbed this set to go with 7726 as I knew there was very little chance I'd find the coastguard motorbike to throw in the back. It was cheap, really speedy to build and looks smart. I read an earlier review which said the author had turned both the main orange plates around and it looked better. I had to try as I cant leave things the way they were supposed to be, and to be fair I found if you turn the FRONT plate around, but leave the rear as per the instructions the little quads look reallllly good, in my humble opinion anyway. (link to pic to go hear as soon as pics taken). Try it, see what you think. Anyway, yes, the small wavy triangular flag would probably have looked better on the rear, with (dare I say it) a little coastguard sticker, but hey, for the couple of pounds the kit cost, I aint complaining! Good kit, great stocking filler! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"HQuiff","2009-03-28T11:25:44.623Z","Nice and easy!","I got this set along with the Indiana Jones Tent set (I forget the name). It's really cool! It took me five minutes to build, you didn't really need the booklet. It is so cute and it runs well on all surfaces. The new rim pieces are great for your own stuff as well as it, it's fantastic. The flag at the back is also cool. And of course the minifig is good for your collection! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kaboomlegoman","2010-02-15T11:53:20.67Z","This is not good.","This isn't a cool set. All you get is a weird 4x4 4-wheeler which has a flag that falls off very easily.


Minifigures: A regular coast guard guy who doesn't really have any detail.


Building: Really bad. It's so small I built it without the instructions once.


Pieces: No new pieces, or any good things.


Playability: If this was a small playset with a jetski, this thing, a buoy, and someone drowning, it would be a wonderful play experience. But with judt this, I find it hard to do anything.


Price: Meh. 5 dollars for a little 4-wheeler. Standard.


Overall: Not a good set. I don't like it. Perhaps the only thing I found fun about it was taking it apart and building different cars out of it. Overall, this set is not good at all and don't get it.",FALSE,2,2,1,3,3
"Danielator36","2015-01-05T04:19:29.88Z","Awesome City Set!","<p>This set is really cool, especially for the price!</p>

<p>The packaging and instructions were fairly standard for set. The set included a few cool pieces, but in general the pieces were normal. The minifigure is nice, but doesn&#39;t include&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;much detail. The building process is fairly easy. The completed model looks really nice and has a lot of playability. In all, I think that the set is really nice.</p>
