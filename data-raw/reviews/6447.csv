"Legobuilderguy","2008-05-21T00:23:50.34Z","Not bad","A new City theme. Not bad really. Found this one in Toys-R-Us today along with a lot of the new Coast Guard sets. This one caught my eye because of the price, 10.99 and the color scheme. Having put it together I find that I like it even more. It looks good at the Harbor set and along side set# 7942 looks similar and makes a nice compliment set to it. 

Pros: 
Cheap
Nice little truck
Cool little jet ski
Diving gear

Cons:
No doors on the truck.
Not a huge gripe for me but I know it is for some so I thought I would add that. For a nice little build and addition to the town a good little set all around.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-06-16T20:32:50.61Z","Good Set, Fast Build","This set took no less than 10 minutes to build while watching TV.  Both of the vehicles are well designed.  I really like the different tires on the truck and trailer.   They are more like sand tires than the typical tires on most of the earlier vehicles.

Definitely a good addition to the Coast Guard sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2008-09-27T08:20:43.17Z","Coast Guard Theme Appeals to City Fan, Orange and Blue Make for Nice Color Scheme","Bought this at Toys R Us as part of a but 2 get 1 free sale (otherwise I would have bought this at Target later on because TRU is a rip off!). I wanted the new wheels, Coast Guard torso and new windshield so I can make a NASCAR MOC (if you don't know what I am talking about check out this website:
http://www.brothers-brick.com/2008/08/12/nascar-racing/

This set is strikingly colorful. The orange and blue look nice together and this set is a reminder that you don't need a lot of every LEGO color in order to make a MOC that uses a rare or harder to find color. The truck itself has roughly 10 orange pieces yet it looks predominantly orange. The Racers Bridge Chase set uses 1x4 orange plates to add a touch of orange to the gas station in that set and this is the 1st time I noticed that you don't need a lot of each color to add that color to your MOCs. 

The wheels for this set are new molds and I think I will be returning a set to TRU to switch for another copy of this set so I can part it out. The mudguards over the wheels are great as are the new mudguards with front studs that help make up the grill in the front. The Coast Guard fig is cool with a bearded face. The torso has a tiny printed walkie talkie on his chest. I don't get this. The walkie talkie part that is on the side of the truck is much larger so why even bother with this detail?

The Jet Scooter is an easy enough build that can be easily replicated as long as you have more of the orange Wedge 4 x 3 Curved with 2 x 2 Cutout part in the front. I have this part in red, white and orange so maybe I see a MOC of a Jet Scooter race in the not too distant future.

"Nemesis_Prime","2008-08-08T04:10:58.2Z","Very Impressed","I picked this up the other day at Toys R Us for $17 AUSD

I didnt think much of it untill i built it i was pleasantly suprised! It is far better then i thought it would be and for a good price! I was thinking this would be just a Coast Gaurd Version of the Fire Pickup Truck but once i built it i noticed its much diffrent! including new [Well ive never seen them before] Tyre pices

Pros:

Good Price
Lots of Playability
Good Colour Scheme
The Car and Trailer/Boat are well built 
Plenty of Acessesories [Air Tanks, Flippers, Helmet &amp; Life Vest]

Cons: The Jetski looks abit weird and open from the side and its abit cramped with 2 minifigs in there, but thats the only bad thing i can think of! Which shows what a good set this is!

This is my Second CG set [Other was CG Buggy]

I would definatly recomend this!

"willow2323","2009-02-08T08:57:22.623Z","Good for the money !","My first coastgaurd set ! A slight let down though. Still, worth the money.


Pros: The minifigure has good detail on his uniform, the wheels on the 4WD give it a smooth driving ability, the jet ski floats for about 25 minutes and the accesories are easy to put on. It's also rather sturdy, and can be dropped from quite a height without smashing.

Cons: the stickers on the jet ski come off quite easily, not enough accesories (a loud hailer would be call), the mans face has a pretty cheesy grin, the trailer is hard to control.

Overall I would reccomend this set, but only to a rather serious collector, for it's play quality is very poor.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Noah1997","2009-06-29T15:19:30.997Z","If You Need A Coast Guard Set Get This!","I say you don't need any other lego coast guard set in lego city, you only need this one you have a jet ski (to save people) flipers and a air-tank and a mask with a snorkle on it, what else whould you possibly need besides it?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"pod120","2009-02-24T05:02:03.09Z","Where's The Kawasaki Stickers!?","This is an excellent set and considering it's size, I think is one of the best City sets of 2008. The colour combinations are good and so is all the Scuba equipment. I think though the part that gives this set a leading edge is the Stand-Up Jetski. A good price too as well as it's astonishingly high levels of playability.

Pros
-Great details on 4WD, Lights and the thick tyres
-Includes lots of accessories (Scuba Equip., Walkie Talkie)
-Jetski is good design and fits well on trailer
-Decent Lifeguard Minifig
-Cool Coast Guard Emblem

Cons
-Life Jacket does not seem necessary as Minifig is already wearing a Bouancy Vest
-Personally I dislike the look of the Registration Plates
-Antenna is not really necessary
-Set has stickers",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T14:52:06.03Z","Another Great Addition to the Coast Guard Series…","I was lucky and managed to get this set very early in it’s production run, I missed out on that awesome Coast Guard Platform so I was quick to collect the other sets.

This set (7737) is a really great addition to the Coast Guard Series, it is attractive in it’s appearance and practical too.   The jeep is sporty with oversized wheel arches, a high grille and bonnet, orange beacons and two spotlights mounted high on a rail arrangement.   The jeep also comes complete with hand held radio and high gain aerial, I think this would have looked better with a small triangular flag at the top.   The only downside of the jeep, I think, is the fact that the cab roof does not hinge to gain access.   Having to remove the roof panel can often result in the spotlights and / or rail coming off also, otherwise it is a small yet sturdy model.   The trailer is unremarkable but does feature a bracket which can be swivelled to keep the trailer level when unattached to the jeep.   The jet ski is attractive and features bright blue and amber sections with a multi-directional handlebar arrangement and small outboard motor attached to the transom via a bracket.

This set is much more realistic than set 7726, and looks equally at home on the beach or in a marina / port setting.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-26T20:33:37.467Z","Interesting","This set is a good set to fool around with. I got this mostly for the pieces, but once I built it, I thought it was worth keeping together. Accessories include a radio, flippers, an oxygen tank, a diving helmet, and a life preserver. The jet scooter is interestingly designed. The problem with this though, is that the wheels are not securely put on. Another problem is, the life preserver keeps falling off it's place on the jet scooter.

pros:
Interesting design.
Lots of accessories.
Jet scooter floats.

cons:
Ridiculous sized antennae.
Wheels are not securely placed on.
Life preserver keeps falling off it's place.

In all an okay set to play with, but get the quad bike with this to increase play-ability.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jake9","2009-11-17T10:25:21.39Z","Reminds me of 6698","This is a cool little set that I bought because it reminded me of 6698, which I loved as a kid. I have a thing for sets with trailers. This one is bigger and better, though. The scuba gear looks authentic, and both the truck and the jet ski look good when assembled. The wheels are rubber and they roll nicely. The life preserver won't stay on, though. I ended up putting it on the minifig so I won't lose it. It's a solid set and it's like a version 2 of good ol' 6698.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"J14T14","2017-04-22T04:16:00.04Z","My First Set","<p>This was my first ever LEGO set. I got it for Christmas and I loved it! For a kid who loved to play with his older brothers LEGO pieces, this was a great first set to have. It came with one truck, a trailer, and a jet ski. The minifigure&nbsp;in the set is not that detailed compared to today&#39;s minifigures, but it is still a good quality figure. The truck has room inside for one figure and there is a rack on the trailer with diving flippers, a scuba&nbsp;tank piece, and a helmet with a&nbsp;Scuba Diver Mask. The jet ski can hold one minifigure and a life jacket. Overall, this is a great first set and I would recommend&nbsp;getting a similar set for your kids first set.</p>
