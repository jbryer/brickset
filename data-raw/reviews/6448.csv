"Legobuilderguy","2008-05-23T02:37:06.967Z","Interesting","Got this one today and just got it put together. I have to say I was rather dubious about this one for a couple of reasons. First let's talk about the set. This is arguably one of the best of the new boat style sets. I have the port and that boat is pretty good. This one I think is better. The boat just looks good. There is enough detail to be a good build but not overly so that the kids won't enjoy it also, this is not for kids under about 7 or so though. Now the part that I was worried about, the platform. This is not too bad, I rather like the tower if you disregard the first two floors and just go with the top control center. Very nice in deed. The equipment storage area is rather interesting in the way it's designed. Other than that it reminds me of the hospital. Nice try but not enough area.
Now the pros and cons.

Pro's: 
Great boat
Good variety of pieces
I like the colors
Decent playability with the tower
Excellent playability for the boat

Con's:
No door for the tower
Only 4 mini figs, not enough coast guardsmen
Flimsy design on the dock, be prepared to re-enforce


All in all not a bad set and if you like the Lego brand boats as much as I do you will be owning this one soon.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoville410","2008-05-24T16:45:23.047Z","Now all lego boaters can feel safe!","Finally there is a new line of Coast Guard more realistic than the old line and R.E.S.Q.
I picked this set up for $60.00+tax at a local TRU. Pricey, but well worth the the wait and the $$!
Pros:
+life-like boat
+crane to put the rescuse boat in the water
+boat has  alot of equipment
+boat has two floors (Mini Hospital room and Control Room

"Hewkii1992","2008-08-13T13:10:54.45Z","A decent set.","I first saw this set inside a display case at my local Target store, and I was greatly impressed by the size of the set.  With some hesitation between the Coast Guard helicopter and the Patrol Boat &amp; Tower, I ended up purchasing this one.  The construction was rather straight forward and simple, but the booklet sometimes doesn't give much attention to adding the little details on this set, something that builders should look out for.  The completed model is quite impressive, and it is expensive but the price is worth it.  

It comes with all the photo above shows, a neat and dynamic tower with a detailed tool room at the bottom, a hospital sporting a bed and a neat little sink, and a control center with a deck which is very detailed.  It isn't the most practical rescue center, but it is a very cool touch.  The dock is also very neat and detailed, but the construction is quite weak, and due to the lack of supports on the top, it could snap in half if picked up without care.  However, it sports rails, a flag and a 'shark warning' sign which is pretty cool.  It also sports a ladder, a coastal light, and some crates and Octan oil canisters for added detail.

The ship is a different story, however.  I don't own many LEGO boats, only an old police boat, a fishing boat from Nautica and a couple of firefighter boats from two different eras, but this one I know is one of my favorites.  It has such a great amount of detail including a miniature hospital compartment, a stretcher, a detailed raft boat with a lifting crane, undersea equipment, life preservers, an anchor, radar, and a control room.  The colors also mix very well, and I cannot notice many flaws with this boat.  It also comes with two 'parking buoys' which are very neat.

The set also includes three coast guard members, a surfer and a rare shark not seen much anymore.  Every set does have flaws however, but this doesn't have many.

Cons:- Flimsy dock, poor instructions, small amount of minifigures.

Pros:- Amazing detail, large control center and dock, flawless boat and cool tools. 

I cannot think of many more to list as of the moment, but hey, if you can pick up this set, I highly recommend it.  This was my starter Coast Guard set, and I plan to collect more because of this one.  Happy Building!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-12-13T10:55:27.217Z","Huge!","The boat is so big.  I saw it on display at Toys R Us and Lego Store, but until I pulled the giant hull out of the box, I did not really understand the scope of the size.

The ship went together easily. There are no really tricky steps, but there are some neat features such as a gurney for a patient that can be airlifted by the wonderful helicopter (7738).  It also has an opening top to put in a driver, and the entire top section comes off easily to allow access to the area where the gurney is kept.  

*I did have a problem putting the long stickers on the sides of the ship. There is a white stripe that starts right under the deck, then stops and continues after the bump on the side of the hull.  Make sure to look at the picture, not follow the directions on placement, or it will be too far forward, and you will have a stripe that does not match.

The tower is fun too.  It stands very tall, and has some nice features as well. The most captivating is the blue semicircular window that dominates the top level of the tower.  Under that is a bed and wash basin.  On the bottom level is a tool corral of sorts with lots of good coast guard materials.

I like the dock area.  Some say that it is flimsy, but I don't think so.  It is nice and long to accommodate the ship being parked there.  It is nice looking with tie-ups all along, and boxes.  I am not a fan of the little light house being on the dock. It looks a little out of place.

All in all, this is a great set.  I am hooked on the coast guard sets since I bought the helicopter set.  This one just adds to the safety of my Lego city water areas.  I recommend this set to City and Coast Guard fans.  There is a lot of playability with the set, and it just looks nice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DevDevBeck","2008-12-06T15:07:02.717Z","Boat: Super Gool Tower: Not as much","   I grabbed this cool set at the lego store earlier this year and i am so amazed! The boat may be somewhat simplistic, but has a nice little deck system. I added a second lifeboat and put some chairs in the bridge, and after that, the boat was near perfect. Who knew it actually floats!
   The tower though is needing a door, and the dock IS a little flimsy. but nothing a couple 2x4 plates can't handle.
PROS:
THE SHIP:
 *Good Design, Pretty Sturdy
 *Really Floats!
 *great edition to any lego harbor
THE DOCK:
 *Very Cool lightstand
 *I like the shark sign

CONS:
THE SHIP:
 None!
THE DOCK:
 *Dock itself is flimsy
 *Control tower's base is also flimsy
I gave this set a 4 becuase of the flimsyness of the dock and tower. Other than that, this would have been a &quot;fiver&quot;.

If you like ships and you like LEGOS then this is the set for you!

"syslam","2009-07-22T11:25:46.107Z","Awesome Rescue Ship","I love the rescue ship, and it is a pity that this ship is not sold separately.

The rescue ship is very sturdy and well designed. Upper deck is spacious and sits up to two people, adding a chair and steerwheel will make it perfect.
Lower deck is the emergency rescue area with oxygen bottle. The front part below the sloped piece contains nothing, it is a waste of space, so I put the board holding the cargo and gas cylinders below the space as a bed and sleeps one more patient.

The rear part of ship contains a life raft which is nice, only lacking round transparent orange lights at sides so it can be seen at distant places.

To make the ship more functional, I suggest making a helicopter platform at the rear part of the ship instead of the lifting arm, like the police ship does. ( I personally made one with the pier 8x8 piece)

For the rescue tower, upper part is the observation tower which is well designed, middle floor is the paramedical area, and lower part is store for tools. I don't have much opinion for this, just turning one of the windows in lowest floor into a door and making an opening in the uppermost floor will be better. Furthermore, personally I suggest adding a fixed telescope at the uppermost floor for observation purpose.

I agree with most of folks that the pier is too filmsy, but details are enough with lighttower. The gas cylinder and cargos are a bit pointless.

Overall it is a great set, but a bit too expensive ( about US $83 in Hong Kong Toys R us)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T15:29:22.75Z","It was a great Birthday present…","I was fortunate enough to have this bought for me for last year’s birthday and it has provided endless satisfaction, both as a display piece and as a working model.   This was the first Coast Guard set that I got and since then I have been slowly collecting the remaining sets.   I am very impressed with the whole set which encompasses three main parts:

The Tower is a very futuristic take on a coast guard base and stands proudly on a ‘rocky outcrop’.   The lower floor houses a tool shop and maintenance area with large picture windows.   The middle floor houses a well-equipped sick bay where casualties can be treated until they are transferred to a hospital.   The top floor is dedicated to the control room with panoramic ‘wrap around’ picture windows.   This area also has a large observation deck with handrail and spotlights.   On the very top of the control room are the various radar / GPS / satellite communication devices.   The tower features the warm amber and cool white colours, as does the rescue ship and other sets in this series.

The Wharf is pretty utilitarian in appearance and features a step arrangement allowing safe passage from the tower to the water’s edge.   The wharf itself features self-draining decking, plenty of handrails, mooring posts, information signs, a dustbin, various pieces of cargo, access ladders and a lighthouse!   I personally think that the lighthouse is unnecessary, as is the dustbin and cargo on a pallet (this would go against health and safety in a working area) so I have moved mine.   Also in this area is a shark, reminiscent of Jaws, two marker buoys and a surfer on a board.

The Ship is a pretty true representation of a real rescue ship, particularly when you look at the German Search and Rescue (SAR) vessels.   The interior (lower) houses a sick bay with fully movable stretcher and various pieces of life-saving equipment.   My only grumble with this area is that the sides are partially open to the outside world so it could be wet / windy and this is the only unrealistic part of the set.   The bridge area is a little sparse, although I have furnished mine better; this is open-backed to provide the skipper a good view of the developing rescue operation.   The twin funnels and burgee mast with large radar dome atop finish this area off very well.   The forepeak is decorated with windlass for anchor handling exercises, mooring bollards, cleats and fire extinguishers.   There is also the presence of ‘non-slip’ pads on the upper deck and the stern deck provides a suitable area for launching / recovering the small Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB) via the attractive and realistic crane arrangement.   There are also handrails and more mooring bollards in this area.

Overall an excellent set, there are a few niggles but they can be overlooked as this set is so pleasing.   I wonder what this year’s birthday will bring?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Montana_8","2009-12-26T20:29:45.747Z","One of the best City sets","One of the best Lego City sets. Here are some details.

Great ship. Pilot house lifts off to give easy use of medical area with stretcher. The crane on the back of the ship easily picks up life boat, and the life boat nicely locks to the deck. Stickers go on easily, great details! Light House is much better than I thought. A nice medical bay with sink, top floor has clock, weather map, and computer. Bottom floor also has a great varity of tools. Dock adds a nice touch but falls apart easily (no big problem). Perfect gift.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Crt2","2010-08-01T20:48:41.36Z","Brilliant!","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>As I Looked at My Previous Reviews, I Realized Less and Less People were Rating My Reviews, ""Helpful"". So Now I'll do a Review on a Set I Really Like, A Set I Got at Wal-Mart for Only $30.</p>
<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>I Bet About Now you all Know What This Set Has and What it Does, So Now I'll Give you The Real Flesh and Bloo-.......Let's&nbsp;Move On&nbsp;Shall We?</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>
<p>Your Average Coast Guard Heroes Have Very Nice Uniforms and Face Printing so Nothing New There. The Civilian, I Think, Has a Very Cool Torso. This is Also The First MF That Has The Glasses/Scowl Head with Hair.</p>
<p><strong>Tower</strong></p>
<p>The Tower is Very Nice. The First room is a Bit...Strange. The Second Room is More Intresting with The Medical Bed and Sink. The Control Room looks The Best I Think, and I Just Love The Glass Walls! The Patio is Another Good Addition, And The Radar is A Nice Touch.</p>
<p><strong>Dock</strong></p>
<p>Another Nice Part. I Like The Mini Light house And The Little Shark Warning Signs. The Bouys are Good too, and So is The Stickered Surfboard. And it's Fun to Have Stairs Leading to The Dock and Tower.</p>
<p><strong>Patrol Boat</strong></p>
<p>The Best Part of The Set is The Patrol Boat, The Medical Room is Very Well Designed And The Control Room is Great too, With 2 Printed Control Panels and an Opening Roof. The Anchor isn't Very Good But I Think the Crane and Life Raft is a Cool Feature. But I Don't Think This Boat is Better Than The New Fire Boat Released This Year.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>
<p>A Fun and Exciting Set! If You're Going to Buy This Set off Bricklink or Something Just for The Boat, I would Recommend The More Detailed Fire Boat of This Year. But The Whole Set Combined is Far Better Than The Single Boat. So I Would, Above all, Recommend This One.</p>
<p><strong>9/10</strong></p>

"av8r1973","2011-01-16T08:58:53.11Z","Great tower - don't care much for the boat","We paid a bit more than retail here in Taiwan because this one just isn't available any longer, but we thought it looked great and had good reviews here on Brickset. My brick ratings seem to have balanced themselves out between the great parts and not so great parts of this set. &nbsp;This could have been truly great, but some serious compromises were made.<div><br></div><div>There are two major units in this kit - the tower and the cutter. &nbsp;With that, this review will focus on each.</div><div><br></div><div>Tower: the curved wall units are great and give a realistic harbor control tower look to the city scene. &nbsp;The orange and white color scheme lends itself nicely to the theme. &nbsp;The tower is three floors high. &nbsp;The bottom floor seems to be a tool storage room with a nice set of tools on a portable cart. &nbsp;The second floor is a medical room with a cot and a sink. &nbsp;The third floor has a rotating chair and electronics console for the watchman. &nbsp;The walk-around platform is nicely done with the flexible railing, too. &nbsp;The roof has a maritime radar and a satellite dish for communications. &nbsp;The whole tower is built on a BURP, but it works well for this set and doesn't look out of place.</div><div><br></div><div>The pier is four sections long, has a small lighthouse tower and a set of stairs that lead up to the tower. &nbsp;A shark warning sign, life buoy and warning flag are on the pier, as is a cargo platform with two oil drums and a couple of industrial-looking cargo crates.</div><div><br></div><div>Cutter: &nbsp;I was actually disappointed with this boat. &nbsp;Similar to my Police Boat, the formed PVC hull was a bore. &nbsp;Nothing unique about the build and my 3yo daughter had it built in about 45 minutes. &nbsp;The superstructure comes off too easily, the crane structure on the back is not held on with nearly enough lugs for playability and there is nowhere for a helicopter to land. &nbsp;I believe a fire cannon is on top of the superstructure, but it really looks out of place. &nbsp;Unless it's remote controlled from the pilothouse, it doesn't have much practical use. &nbsp;Most real cutters have a small helipad. &nbsp;The shark, surfer and surfboard were a nice touch, as were the two buoys.</div><div><br></div><div>Positives: With all that negative surrounding the cutter, the set redeemed itself partially through the use of some new components for me. &nbsp;The sides of the superstructure are unique, the anchor mechanism is clever and the masthead is new for me. &nbsp;The blue-tinted curved glass walls on the tower look great. The chainsaw attachment and harpoon were new for me, too.</div><div><br></div><div>Room for Improvement: Install a slightly raised helipad over the small boat storage bay. &nbsp;The pad should be hinged to allow access to the small boat when the helicopter is on a mission. &nbsp;Move the fire cannon to the bow - lots of room there and it could be manned more easily. &nbsp;Strengthen the joint between the stairs and the pier, as well as the joint between the stairs and the rocks. &nbsp;Can't move it without it coming apart. &nbsp;Moving the lighthouse to the top of the tower and making a bit larger would be nice. &nbsp;It would be more like a lighthouse. &nbsp;Inclusion of a single grey rocky and blue water baseplate that didn't increase the price would make this kit far more useful (and fix the stair joint issue), as well as justifying the price of the kit. &nbsp;While the kit is large, the single-piece cutter hull accounts for the bulk of it and the value just isn't there.</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: If you already have a fireboat, then you don't need this one (nearly the same boat). &nbsp;If you are starting a seaport, this would come in handy. &nbsp;Not bad, but certainly not great.</div>",TRUE,4,3,5,5,4
