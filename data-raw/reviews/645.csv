That is unheard of for such a small set.  Not bad part selection, and two figs.  Oh I long for sets like this again!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-24T14:11:26.59Z","Black knights Guardshack","This is a small set of the castle theme, black knights subtheme. This is really small, but all the pieces are useful. The two minifigures included, one ghost and one black knight are simple designed, but also nice, in a classic castle lego style. The set also includes for the knight, a helmet and a axe. The ghost have a piece that features the glow in the dark effect, that cover all the minifigure, except the arms. The  little tower is easy to build, basic to play and great to increase other castle sets. The tower is completely black and it makes a good effect on the design, combined with the knight, ghost and also the two spears on the top of the tower, alongside with a flag. There is also a stair on the back of the tower, that makes it looks like more a tower of a castle. Altough the set is really little and it not features much playability, this set is good builted and overall a cool small castle set. So, i rate it 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

My brother and I split it--he took the town and pirate sets and I took the castle and space sets. <br><br>I like this set more than the similar Black Monarch's Ghost set. The ladder and guard tower design give it more play value. The printed flag is also a nice touch. A lone guard in the middle of the realm would be a dangerous job, so I pretend the ghost is the spirit of the last guy to have that job!<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
