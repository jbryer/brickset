At first glance also something that would justify what I consider a somewhat steep price. If you collect boxes, I guess you'll love this set. If you just throw them away, but collect rare pieces, the only interest in this set is the golden, as in a tan with sprayed-on, chrome-gold paint, 2x4-brick. It does look fantastic though, even if wear is a concern regarding the paint.

Other than that there's just the regular bunch of bricks you'll find in every bucket and brick-box out there today.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
