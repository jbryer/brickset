"phoinix","2008-05-19T09:29:18.653Z","finally a great parts pack","so this is the first review here for this set and im happy to do it.

we havent seen a parts pack like this in many years.
and now its the best time for lego to make one.
they have designed new doors and windows which we saw for the first time in the green grocer and the beach house.
there are 100 pieces here.
you get 4 white and 4 black one stud thick windows and 4 yellow and 4 red two stud thick. I really dont like the two studs thick once i find them too juniozized.
Also you get 8 doors in the same colors as the windows also slim and thick.

the newest part here is the green shutter. The last time we saw a shutter was in the &quot;building bonanza&quot; set but these have a whole different design. I really dont like it as they are too big and when they close they dont fit to the window. Also they are not attached to the window but on a separate new part that looks like the old school part for putting in shutters or garage doors.

the colors are pretty much ok and very basic.
im not sure they would fit well with new colors like sand green or tan.

you also get 8 smaller windows in black and white and a blue glass for each.
I would rather the glass window was transparent.

All and all this is worth getting if you like building houses like i do.
Im very happy lego made this set.
Who knows maby we will see some more if these sell well

i paid 12 euro for it in Greece but i am sure that it will be about 10 euro for other countries as lego is very expensive here.

"asianlego","2008-10-22T11:52:35.543Z","Great addition to houses!","For the first time (I think) TLG has mass-produced a bulk parts pack like this for everyone. This set is really cheap, I got this for RM 40 ($12) and there are exactly 100 pieces. The set includes many door frames, window frames, windowpane holders, windowpanes, tiny windows (like the aircraft windows), glass doors, normal doors, and also which I agree with user 'phoinix' as being too juniorized, the 4x2 stud windows and doors (what are those, Jack Stone?!). But nevertheless, the set now gives my town more variety in terms of doorways and windows. Now all I need to get now is a Roof Tiles pack.

"alva","2011-03-30T02:14:45.517Z","A Great set to own for building a house","Along with the 6619 Roof tiles, this set is a basic that I think everyone that want to build a house should have. It makes building a house a lot more economical than shopping the window and door pieces one by one in a Bricklink stores.<br><br>The set comes with lot of different style doors and windows, so you can create a lot of combination and creates a different feeling houses. I really love this set and I think Lego is doing a great thing by giving us a set that contains bulk of windows and doors.<br><br>What I dont like about this set is that the box is having a potential to fool someone. A couple times when I shop for Lego in stores around the city, I met a couple of parents with their little kids scrolling around the Lego area of the store, probably want to buy the kids their first Lego ever. Since the price of this set is quite cheap compared with other set and since the picture displaying a house, some of them deciding to buy it, hoping that their little ones can build a house using this set only. Imagine if they got home, the kids open the box and find that they only got windows and doors and there's no way they can build a house using only these parts?<br><br>For conclusion, I think Lego is doing a great job for providing a bulk of windows and doors in a set, but I believe they should design the box better to avoid there's some people feel tricked by their content.<br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,3
"Naylus","2009-07-15T13:30:09.857Z","Open Your Windows","I bought this set out of curiosity actually... A found it to ve a very nice addition to my bricks. Though I had many windows and walls to create a town, that was still not enough. After I bought this ""package"" I could construct almost evrything I ever wanted.

However this set has at least one drawback: You can't use all of the windows and doors at once. I mean, that there're not enough frames in the set, so You'll to put away some of the doors or glass that You won't be able to attach...

P.S. I used 1 extra glass (that can't be used) for 7620-1: Indiana Jones Motorcycle Chase set. There You have a hollow frame. You can combine them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Harmonious_Building","2012-04-03T22:13:12.587Z","Open the door, get on the floor. ","The graphic here on BrickSet (as of April 2012) does make this collection seem slightly deceptive, although I do find it hard to imagine that anyone would actually think that a box titled “Doors and Windows” contains pieces for an entire house or building. In any case, the front of the actual box features, well, DOORS and WINDOWS, which is more than enough explanation for me.<br><br>This set, of course, is next to useless on its own. I bought Doors and Windows for the purposes of expanding the number of buildings in my city without having to wade through BrickLink or other third-party sellers to get pieces that I want. My first goal was to build an office building for Tony Stark, and there’s enough variety in Doors and Windows that I think I did a pretty good job with the help of Basic Bricks Deluxe (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6177-1"">6177</a>). Among other things, Doors and Windows comes with a couple of very nice frames and transparent panes that allow for a very modern-looking construction. But you also get a number of “traditional” windows and doors for country-type houses and some nice “holder” pieces that you could use either for the designed purpose of holding the window shutters or for other designs.<br><br>The sheer variety of designs included in Doors and Windows make this a great “expansion pack” type set to have for prospective city builders. The set is also priced pretty competitively considering that all you are getting is special pieces. If you feel that your city could do with something more than police and fire stations, pick up this along with Basic Bricks Deluxe and give your creativity a whirl. You might even surprise yourself! <br>",TRUE,4,5,1,5,4
