This include a pirate minifigure and also a monkey minifigure, the both in a old classic lego style. The designs of the minifigures are simple and nice, and the pirate also have a original pirate hat and sword. The small yellow plate, used too in small pirates sets is cool to make a floor and of course to combine more pieces of this set. It also includes a tree created with some useful pieces todo exactly a tree. The treasure is the same of the others and too useful on the sets of this theme. The playability of this set is basic and the building good. But unfortunately this set is so much small and the pieces aren't new in relation with the other pirates small sets. So, i rate the Pirates Treasure Hold 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I like the hidden compartment for the treasure and the monkey which are a great part of Lego Pirates and are always hard to find online. The palm tree and the pirate minifig also make this set great. This is a very crafty set and it deserves a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
