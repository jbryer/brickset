Not much, but I must say there are enough pieces to make cars move, use them for other things like I needed the rims for (as casters): a crane. So actually the rubber is not used then, but only the plastic rims.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Enough parts to make one huge truck, or even two or three<br>Also the axle parts can come in handy<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>On itself you can very little with this set, but I think that's not what it supposed to do in the first place; use it with other sets to extend the possibilities<br></li></ul>
<p>Conclusion: nice set, multiple colored wheels (rims) in various sizes. Useful for Lego City (for small cars to 'bigwheels') and Technic (for various uses).<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
