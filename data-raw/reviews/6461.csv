The bricks suffice to build a really nice and stylish roof that e.g. covers an area of 15 x 22 (T-formed). There are enough concave and convex slopes to create a variety of totally different looking roofs.
The only drawbacks -- depending on your preferences they may be advantages -- of this set are, that there are only 45 degree slopes (which imho make for more scenic roofs) and that this set only comes for red slopes (I'd prefer black ones).

If you like red+45 degree, this set would get 5 points; for fans of red+33 degree and not-red+45 degree roofs this still gets 4 points as it is simply good value; everyone else: Abstain! ;)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

They come with lots of red 45 degree slope and it helps you a lot if you want to create a house.<br><br>So, instead of buying the slopes one by one, you just grab one or two of this set and you can use them for your house roof.<br><br>The only weakness of this set is that they only come with a red slopes, so if you want to use different color for your house roof, you still got to collect them one by one. I think it will be really great if in the future Lego can launch this set in variety of colors, so we have other options for our roof color.<br>",TRUE,3,4,1,3,4
