*** Other Notes ***
Many fans and enthusiasts of LEGO hold a belief that basic LEGO pieces are *always* useful. Almost all LEGO creations contain some amount of basic LEGO pieces, so this set is a great way to 'bulk-up' on basic pieces.

If you are gift-giving, this set is a great way to start a child's LEGO collection, as there are enough basic pieces and 'specialty' pieces (wheels, doors, windows, etc...) for a child to 'get building'.
