"BrickPiet44","2008-11-18T06:35:04.2Z","Strange set","This is a rather strange set from the early 1970 Legoland series. A milk truck? In my memory there were not many milk trucks in actual life. Why then a milk truck? Why not a grocery truck? The truck and trailer are rather  basic. They contain some milk churns (blue round 1x1 bricks) but not many, in fact too little to be of real play value in a town. It can be used as a transport set fo all kind of other things, so that can be of extra play value. So this set is OK, but it remains a rather strange set in the Legoland set range.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>The build is simple with some larger plates as bases of the truck and trailer. The wheels are great axles and with solid rubber tires.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a kid I was wondering why there are only a&nbsp;blue round bricks for load given. I was expecting to have the truck fully loaded and always looking for more milk cans.&nbsp;</p>
