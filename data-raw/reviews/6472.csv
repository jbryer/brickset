It's easy to build and is great if your trying to make an army of skeletons, and makes an awesome opponent if you buy set 7078 King's Battle Chariot instead of some dumb trolls that will just bump into chariot and hurt themselves. Anyway! It is an awesome set (is it a set?) and fun to play with.      ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
