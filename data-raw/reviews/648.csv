<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Town - This is the one set that's a downer for me. I don't particularly like this race car, mainly it's model and lack of a number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Castle - This looks like a small tower that features a ghost and minifigure. Both are good as I was looking to collect all the sets featuring ghosts and the minifigure isn't bad for an army builder though it's not certain or clear which army he'd go to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Space - This is a Blacktron 2 set with a little space ship that's not bad for build and a Blacktron 2 minifigure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pirates - This isn't too bad... not when I was out to collect all the Pirate sets I could. There's a palm tree, a minifigure with a tricorne hat, chest of gold hidden in rocks and a monkey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Value Packs aren't bad if you're wanting a sampling of different themes and are a collector who wants to get them.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
