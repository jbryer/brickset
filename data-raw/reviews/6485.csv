Let's start with the inventory (SPOILER ALERT!) for those of you who are buying this set without actually following the ritual of opening a door each day.
SPOILER ALERT.

MINIFIGS
There are a total of 9 minifigures. Let's go through them one by one.

-A Castle knight with a cone helm and a spear.
-A short dwarf with pickaxe.
-A maid with a broomstick.
-A troll with a bronze variant of the troll scimitar.

CASTLE ACCESSORIES
-Arch with shield mount and flag.
-Catapult (small)
-Archery range consisting of a Bow, Quiver, and a Bullseye.
-Treasure chest with 3 different gems.
-Cart with Crossbow mount.

The base idea it's very good to have beautiful additional minifigs.
Before to buy it I have read other reviews from more sources and I notice that most of the people wanted and still wants this set for Jester.
Me too I wanted this set especially for Jester, and second for maid and witch.
Other minifigs are nothing special, 2 skeletons, 1 pikeman, 1 swordsman, 1 orc and 1 dwarf.
Comparing with other castle sets, these shiny parts like helmet and armor looks horrible. The mark on the shield it's also horrible and excepting the crossbow, all other weapons looks very bad.

Over all, the main reason to have this set is the Jester and I recommend it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
