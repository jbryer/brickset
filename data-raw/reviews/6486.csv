"Michel","2008-07-08T01:49:16.2Z","could be much better....","I received this set last saterday and built it in about 5 hours.
1626 is a lot of pieces which are, I must say, very nicely organisd by the Lego company.
Pro's:
- it's huge
- it's, as for appearance, a good imitation.

Con's:
- disappointing is the fact that it doesn't have steering, and worse...
- it has fixed axels for the wheels, so it's not turned easily

Furthermore I would have really appreciated if there had been building instructions for the convertible. There's enough bricks within the set.

Since it really is for display use ony I'm giving it 3 out of 5.
I own Model Team 5571, 1996, big truck 'black cat', 1743 pieces. I couldn't help comparing and the old Model Team won by far due to functionality.

Nevertheless I'm glad I bought it, it's the frst Lego-set even my wife enjoys!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The front of the Bug looks very good with the headlights and the bumper. The interior blowed me away when I first saw it. The Bug doesn't steer which I don't like at all. Still, this is a good one to buy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"cys07gz","2008-07-28T21:04:35.483Z","Some suggestions","I built several of the Lego Ferrari vehicles, so this &quot;more a display than working model&quot; Beetle is not unexpected.

Some suggestions to share.

To avoid causing damage to the wheels and axles while trying to push, or even &quot;turn&quot; the Beetle, I suggest taking away each of the two axles that connect the left and right wheels together. Whether taking away only the axles, or together with the four black connectors is up to individuals choice, but I leave them there to make the rolling smoother. By giving each of the four wheels independence, the Beetle's maneuverability is so much better.

About closing the front and back hatches, try use your finger to sooth the edges of the inside of the two compartments. After the soothing, use just-enough force to &quot;widen&quot; the two sides.  Right after finish building the Beetle, I could not close both hatches. After doing the above exercise, they close and open well.

The wheel covers, in order to make them staying at the outmost for better appearance, do not puch too hard while putting them on. Rather, work from the insides on the stoppers.

Hope the above helps.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"thebrickbuster","2008-08-15T06:04:58.747Z","True treasure","Well done LEGO congratulations on a superb model
I've just finished building this set over the last few nights. WOW! what a masterpiece!
This is a great replica of the beetle with a big emphasis on the little details like the seats the contols and the bonnet.
This model is strong and very swooshable.
The comment about the fixed axles is valid but I believe it's not necessary.It's a minor flaw overall.
I wasn't keen on the colour scheme when I saw it on the internet, but seeing it in the flesh enhances the appeal even more.

"VWBeetle1626","2009-08-24T04:39:32.2Z","Niesamowity Volkswagen Beetle!","Jest to chyba najlepszy zestaw z serii Exclusive! Duza ilosc klocków (1626), piekny wyglad, otwierane drzwi, ruchome oparcia foteli, oraz otwierany bagaznik i klapa od silnika to najwieksze zalety tego niesamowitego zestawu.

Moim zdaniem cena za ten zestaw jest w sam raz. Jedyna drobna wada jest brak modelu alternatywnego, jednak kilka godzin skladania pojazdu rekompensuje ta wade. Instrukcje budowy sa czytelne, latwo mozna zbudowac ten samochód. Bardzo polecam!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jf","2009-10-29T19:21:08.17Z","Nice build, big eyecatcher","At the moment we saw this set, we knew we had to buy it.

It was a dream putting it together. This is one of those sets that gives you value for money in build time alone. Even during the build you'll notice the smart details the design team put into this car. The glovebox alone put a big smile on my face. The finished product is a great (and by all means big) eyecather.

Critisism: as mentioned by others, it would have been even nicer if some functionality had been built in too. Real steering wheels would have been a nice touch, and a smoother ride would have been appreciated. Also: the big flat slap on top of the roof is a small put down on the otherwise smartly executed excercise of approaching the original shape while taking into account the impossibilities of the Lego system and standard lego bricks.

As it is, this is a set that allways attracts attention and praise from everybody who enters our living room. I love it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"IndianGuardian","2010-12-12T03:22:00.13Z","Good Set, could have been great","My mom is very fond of the&nbsp;Volkswagen Beetle and it's her dream to own one. The real one is horrendously expensive in India (USD $46,000). So I bought the Lego&nbsp;Volkswagen Beetle for her on her birthday.<div><br></div><div>To begin with, box came all right and no missing pieces. Instructions are clear and accurate.</div><div><br></div><div>Building it was interesting and not monotonous or a drag. I particularly loved building the roof and the bonnets of the car. While yes, a more curved roof could have been more challenging, I am equally happy with the roof and it does look fabulous.</div><div><br></div><div>The end model is very accurate, a delight to look at and is a purely a display piece. It cannot be integrated with your other Lego sets.</div><div><br></div><div>Looking at the cons, I would have loved to see more details for a limited edition, commemorative set. To begin with, for the Volkswagen logo, you need to put a sticker. For an officially licensed, commemorative set for Lego's 50th anniversary I would have at least expected a &nbsp;Volkswagen painted brick instead of a sticker. Also, the commemorative plate with the details, is once again a sticker! A printed plate would have been nice.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, though no points cut for this, I would have liked working headlights or something around that. I feel Lego has great potential towards making licensed, commemorative sets iconic...just need to work on it more.</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,1,4
"FlyBy","2012-01-12T18:08:31.63Z","A Must Have","As a huge Volkswagen van and modifying them in real life, I'm ecstatic to have this set.&nbsp; My wife bought this for me for Christmas in 2010 (had to propose after that!).&nbsp; This is a great set with great detail, considering it's made out of Lego bricks.&nbsp; Sure there could always be more ways to improve the set, but considering Volkswagen actually licensed it, someone in Germany had to think it looked great!<br><br>If you love Volkswagen and Lego, then you have to have this set in your collection.&nbsp; The Charlotte model with it's two tone blue is an eye catcher in real life.&nbsp; Some people complain that this is considerably larger than the newer 10220-1 T1 Camper Van, but then again, scale isn't correct with all sets like the Eiffel Tower and Tower Bridge sets.<br><br>If you can find this for a decent price, you really should pick it up.&nbsp; My wife got it in it's final days on sale on the Lego site.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"pug_x_1","2016-01-27T05:10:21.623Z","A great display model, but what about play?","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions were clear, there were no mistakes. Note that the box is rather large.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of great parts. Plenty of dark and light blue bricks of all colors. The wheels are also nice, and rather hard to find in that color.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t repetitive or boring. You start with a technic frame, then go on to build up from there. The majority of this build is with bricks and the beetle has no technic mechanisms such as steering or motorization.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A great display piece. The doors, trunk, hood,and glove compartment can open. There is a fully detailed engine in the back. The pedals can move up and down along with some of the various levers. I find it strange that the steering wheel only moves up and down; it does not rotate.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great set if you like cars. Nowadays it does sell for quite a lot ($700 USD), so I recommend that you wait for the right opportunity if you are going to buy it.</p>
