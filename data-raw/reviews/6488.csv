I'm not very big on the &quot;Creator&quot; sets, but atleast this one is a robot bat creture.  First of there are some cool elements in this set that could be used for alternate construction; be your interest in city, space, or what have you.  The idea of using mini-fig legs as fingers is ingenious to me and the the wings though simple are the touch that made the figure.  The figure does have eleven points of articulation not counting the three on each had for a total of seventeen.  The six metalic &quot;claw&quot; pieces are awsome...won't be long before they become part of two new traffic lights.  I give this set a three; cause, though I wouldn't have picked this set up in a store...I have found uses for the bricks.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2008-02-09T09:55:54.86Z","Brickmaster Exclusive Line!","This batbot is a cute little set but what has me excited is that it is an exclusive set to Brickmaster subscribers. Last year I received sets that I could have easily bought in stores, what fun is that? 
I have to thank Brickset for posting pics of the set on line. I hadn't received my set yet but I did get the magazine. I thought the set would come in February but when I saw the release date on Brickset I called LEGO and told them that I hadn't received the set yet. They told me that a lot of people were calling to say that they hadn't received the set either. Thank you Brickset! I probably wouldn't have realized I was owed a set until much later. The Brickmaster program seems to change each year.
Now on to the set review. 

The color scheme works well together. Black, blue and dark gray. The model has so many points of articulation but unfortunately this is also a weak point for this set because when I went to count and operate the joints the figure fell apart (head detached from body, both wings fell off, a hand fell off as well as a foot). I am an adult here, not a rambunctious 3rd grader so I was handling the figure pretty delicately. It is a shame. Perhaps this was a major reason for the short loved Exo-Force theme. I wonder if the mechs in that toy line fell apart. I never had any mechs from that toy line so I can't give any personal experience but it does make me wonder if those bots were flimsy like this batbot.

The parts included are really great. 8 black cheese slopes, a turntable, 6 silver 1x1 plates with tooth, hinged plates, brackets and plates with clips. Putting this set together was fun but I can't imagine playing with it too much because the thing falls apart so easily. This theme doesn't do much for my imagination and I won't be trying to build a similar model. 

Another plus for this set is that it includes an inventory. This is great because I will be adding the pieces from this set to my own brick collection. If the time ever arrives when I need to or want to build this set again in the future, the parts list will come in handy. For now, this is a great set to break down into my parts collection. 

I wouldn't purchase this set in stores but for a Brickmaster set I am glad that it is an exclusive and that there is an actual line dedicated to subscribers. I can't wait to see what the sets look like throughout the year. I hope they can be City or Racers themed sets. The fragility of the finished model really hurts the score in my mind but it does come with some great parts.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

It does break easily, but you can still play with it or build something with all the unique peices that come in this rare brickmaster set. I might recommend this to a friend, I don't really know.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
