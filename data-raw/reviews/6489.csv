Sure you have to pay for a BrickMaster subscription, but if the quality of the sets continue to be this good, it will be the best money you ever spent.

Pros:
- Great design, the new front and back grill pieces are especially good.
- Plenty of tools, transparent bricks, and other specialty parts.
- Minifig!
- NO STICKERS!

Cons:
- The color scheme doesn't exactly scream &quot;fire car&quot;, but I think its still good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-03-13T16:17:33.34Z","Nice Fire Car!","This set I got today and it is awesome! It has a good sturdy design and a minifigure for the car. The set as stated has NO stickers which is really good and it also has nice tools.

Pros.

-car design

- tools and minifigure

-No Stickers

cons: none

Overall it does say all about it in the pictures and if you want a nice set it is a good one to get ahold of.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Stash","2008-03-18T16:58:09.967Z","Follow the yellow brick truck!","I just subscribed to Brickmaster, and I love it so far. 

This set has a lot to offer and as an exclusive it represents what Brickmaster has to offer very well. 

It has 56 pieces and is part of the City theme. 

Mini-Fig:

The minifig has a good design and comes with great accessories. The head is a fairly unique head and I do not believe I have seen this head design before. It may be new or exclusive to this set. Either way it is great. The figure comes with a full helmet and oxygen tank set-up with a shoulder piece to connect the helmet and oxygen tank. The tubes look reminiscent of a deep-sea themed diving suit and really works well. The figure also comes with an axe and a fire extinguisher.

The car:

The car has an interesting design. It is small and stylish, but with the yellow coloring and the rear attachment with the lights appears more like a dune-buggy for beach rescue than a standard fire car. The Yellow bricks could easily be replaced with some red ones to make the car fit into an established fire station or it could be used with a coastal fire department as well. No doors on the car again makes it feel like a beach/offroad type vehicle but I like the uniqueness of it and as an exclusive set I am very happy with the design.

Accessories:

The fireman has an axe, fire extinguisher, and full oxygen helmet/tank setup. 


Overall Impression:

An excellent tiny set. No stickers, however no printed pieces either. If this set is representative of what Brickmasters can expect with each shipment I imagine everyone is very satisfied and it makes the high subscription price relatively bearable. Essentially the subscription is for a free magazine with a standard 50-60 piece lego set purchased at normal price. Though it may not be for everyone, I definitely recommend it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rgijaba","2008-03-24T19:20:21.467Z","the colors dont look like a fire truck...","but if its a fire truck, well live with it... now im NOT a LEGO city fan, but was pleased to get this! its realy big for a Brick Master set, but who cares?! its a plus! it comes with a fire fighter guy, and ALL his fore-fighting accsesories! its all nicely built, and though its a bit hard to get him in the quad (his hat gets stuck in the bars), he still looks neat in it... the truck was an easy, yet fun build, with a realy nice lil truck as a reward! its head lights are wierd colors, but oh well... overall, get it if your a city fan, a Brick Master (like me), or wanna get it...

"tkettle9719","2012-01-06T07:28:33.257Z","Fire in the Woods!","<p>I got this set from my parents around my birthday, my first experience with Lego Shop@Home. This set is really awesome, and among the only City sets that I will ever get. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-I as a small child was pleased with it, which means it's still okay now; in other words, the car looks cool, though it wouldn't if I received it right now. <br></li><li>-Details, like the ax, extinguisher, oxygen, and the red and blue lights are all excellent. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Where's the red in this? It needs a bit more stereotypicality (my new word of the day). <br></li><li>-The oxygen piece is cool, but can be easily bended, like mine. Take caution with it!<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is great, and rather rare, though it probably could be built using parts from your collection right now. I recommend it, but remember that it is a child's toy.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
