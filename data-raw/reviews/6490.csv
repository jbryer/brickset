This is a great set, I just got it 35 min. ago. The only problem is the hands are to short, and the neck can't move from side to side. Other than that,it is a great set, and I can't wait for the Indiana Jones one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2008-08-30T15:23:50.53Z","At Least You Get Green Plates!","I have this set and it is way too similar to the X-Pod Dinosaur set #4418. I was happy to receive another Brickmaster Exclusive set but upset to see how similar it was to a set I already owned. The best parts in this set in my opinion are the green plates because I didn't have too many of them. The completed model isn't terribly sturdy and it looks odd. The arms are short but if you know anything about meat eating dinos, they usually had very short arms that looked way too small for their body so this aspect of the set doesn't bother me 1 bit. I wasn't terribly impressed with this set because it feels like a set I already own and the model feels way too unstable. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2008-12-27T15:50:16.827Z","Not the best","This set is extremely wierd. First of all I can't tell what it's supposed to be! It's arms are short and it's hands are huge. It's teeth aren't even in it's mouth and the feet are gigantic! Overall just get this set for the parts cuz that's the only Pro to it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"tkettle9719","2011-12-26T23:55:07.833Z","A nice little pet...","<p>This set is underestimated, to be honest. I think it's rather nice, and nearly pays out one-fourth of the BrickMaster membership, though it's projected value is some on the lines of $6.<br></p>
<h4>Pros<br></h4>
<ul><li>-The green and brown elements really work well together, as do the black and the white.<br></li><li>-I feel as if this dinosaur is truly cute, but is fierce at the same time, similar to that of a Gremlin. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The red eyes just don't do it for me. <br></li><li>-The arms were sort of a waste, what with their limited functionality. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is limited, but I do highly recommend it. It's cute, fierce, and has a very favorable price-to-piece ratio!<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,5
