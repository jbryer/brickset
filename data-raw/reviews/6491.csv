Only 690 Taiwan dollars (US equivalent about $21). This set is great! One: it is rare and is worth a lot. Two: the helicopter is really cool and looks good. I mainly got this set for the raft though, but the helicopter is cool too. The raft is pretty basic but still has good parts (backpack and camera). 

Overall

Raft 4/5

Helicopter 5/5

Set overall 9.5/10

Great set get it if you can find it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
