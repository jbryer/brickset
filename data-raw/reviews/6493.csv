They had several of these available with different designs on the tshirt but all were construction themed. I have a son who is equally enthusiatic about lego so i gave him the shirt and kept the set. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Easy build...took about 25 seconds. Standard lego face. Just a standard set. I wasnt expecting anything spectacular out of a polybag set so i was not disappointed. T shirt and set were 10 USD.<br>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,3

Those sets cost 390 HUF (~1,7 dollars!) which is even less then the retail price of a collectible minifig! So I picked up this one and the Mini Sub too. Well, I felt strangely about it...<br>
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>No box, because it's a polybag set with some warnings on the back in dozens of languages. We get a small folded instruction sheet with it, and it advertises HARBOUR sets! Kind of strange for me, because it's a construction set. But it doesn't matter, go forward.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4>23 pieces and no extras. Not so much. Mainly classic elements, but the rare digger bucket also appeared. We get a pickaxe and a motor hammer, but it would be better if TLG put some material to doze (three 1x1 studs would be still OK).<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>The dozer is driven by a happy construction worker - standard figure, but I like it because of his cool orange clothes and the red helmet. His head even looks like a real worker's.&nbsp; <br>
<h4>The build</h4>Nothing special. It's base is a 2x4 plate, you put the wheels downstairs, the digger bucket, the chair and the steering wheel upstairs, and you are finished. It takes ~2 minutes to build<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The small dozer looks neat, but a bit unrealistic. Well, you can doze away your bricks with it.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I bought it for its price, because I needed one more worker guy. Under 3 dollars it's a good buy because of the minifig and some rare elements. The dozer itself is weird, but cute. If you really need to have a machine with digger bucket, buy it immediately. If you don't, get it if it's cheap.</p><p>Thanks for reading and sorry for my English grammar knowledge :D.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5
