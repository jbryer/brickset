"water_jedi_17","2008-09-18T19:17:34.107Z","more better than the original","As my title states, this is better than the original TIE fighter. At the bottom are the pros and cons.
 The TIE is connected by a long technic piece that keeps it from breaking easily, unlike the original. Just like the original, it uses the transparent dish piece as the cockpit. The wings are larger compromising of five pieces. The pieces look scaled down compared to the wings of the larger TIE.
  Pros:
more details
strong pieces
more pieces
 Cons:
lacks laser cannons but after all, it is a mini so itâ€™s not much of a problem ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"Cbl","2020-05-02T21:28:00.803Z","Hours of fun","<p>This may be nostalgia taking over, but this set is amazing. When I was in elementary school, my parents bought this for me. It&#39;s a very simple, easy build, and most builders can complete it in under 10 minutes. This is my favorite&nbsp;polybag ever released, because I played with this for&nbsp;<em>hours</em>. And I mean&nbsp;<em>hours</em>. Swooshing this around the living room was a lot of fun as a kid. A great value for your buck! Kids will love this.

"Slobrojoe","2020-05-07T15:55:58.29Z","An old TIE in a new(er) poly bag","<p>The TIE Fighter is one of the most iconic and recognisable Star Wars ships ever. In my opinion, it would be third on the most iconic Star Wars ships list&nbsp;after the first&nbsp;place Millennium Falcon and the second place X-wing. Just to give you an idea of how famous this set in LEGO is, I&#39;m going to put it up against the Millennium Falcon on the &#39;microscale&#39; factor. The Millennium Falcon features in 7 microscale sets: 2 Microfighters (one with Chewie and the other with Han); 1 in-store Toys R Us build; 2 magazine gifts; and 3 standard polybags. Comparatively, the standard TIE Fighter alone features in 8&nbsp;microscale sets; 1 Microfighter; 5&nbsp;standard polybags; 1 magazine gift; and 1 in-store Toys R Us build. That is pretty impressive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ve got the stats out the way, I&#39;ll link in my second and third picture reviews because I may refer or compare to them in this video.</p>

<p>30275: TIE Advanced Prototype-&nbsp;https://brickset.com/reviews/56358&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without further ado, I shall start my fourth picture review!</p>

<p>P.S. I&#39;m sorry about the black-on-black photos!</p>

<h3>Availability:</h3>

<p>This set was available in the UK via The Sun newspaper on Sunday the 27th of May, 2008. It was also available in the UK when customers ordered a bundle of &pound;50 or more from Lego.com during March 2012. In the US, the set could be purchased at Target in 2013. Finally, it was given away at the LEGO Club Day at LEGOLAND Germany in October 2008.</p>

<h3>Packaging/Instructions:</h3>

<p>This set came in a polybag, but I no longer have it for photography purposes. If you&#39;re desperate, the standard Brickset image is basically the whole of the polybag. The instructions are a fold-out leaflet featuring a total of eight easy to follow steps. There are two things that strike me as different from the other two TIEs I reviewed (see links above). Firstly, the picture of the completed model that you can find on any Star Wars polybags is on the right-hand side, rather than the left, as with the other poly bags I&nbsp;have reviewed. Secondly, the new parts that are placed on the build each time have their part numbers to the side of the step.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49844832648_bb42ae09f9_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 149px;"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49845374856_06e539121d_o.jpg"" style=""width: 99px; height: 149px;"" /></p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>44 pieces are used in the model. The pieces aren&#39;t very rare but the rarest piece is the blue 2x4 plate with three holes down the middle, which appears in a total of 39 sets. The main colours are blue and black, which take on the colour scheme left off from the TIEs between 1999 and 2004. After that, there&#39;s nothing special about these parts.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49845680802_189e0da4f8_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 103px;"" /></p>

<h3>The Build:</h3>

<p>The build is separated into three parts: the main body, the left wing and the right wing. The build is very simple, even for beginners, taking no longer than three minutes. The main body is set upon an axle, just like the First Order Special Forces TIE Fighter. The wings are assembled in practically the same way as its First Order counterpart, just with slightly more pieces involved.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49845680842_e0ebd09f9f_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 64px;"" /></p>

<h3>The Completed Model:</h3>

<p>Let me roll off some pictures.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49845375046_53b53c3074_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 114px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49845680792_8a1912768b_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 114px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49844832858_b36781edcb_o.jpg"" style=""width: 74px; height: 114px;"" /></p>

<p>The wings are adorned with blue grills and a 2x2 round plate, which fits the axle on. Whilst the First Order TIE uses big gear wheels between the body and the wings, this one uses only small grey nuts. The cockpit lacks detail but gives the ship a sort of rustic feel, whilst the same technique is utilised in the TIE Advanced Prototype, it isn&#39;t as complimentary. Maybe a touch more blue would have been ideal to make this set a little more like the bigger sets from 1999.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Price:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>In the US, the set would set you back a whopping $5, whilst a Sun newspaper would have been about &pound;4, which I think is a more reasonable price point.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>I really like this set, and it takes a proud place upon my Kallax IKEA shelves. Although 8028 doesn&#39;t trump others in the facts of price, parts, playability or building experience, it is a truly wonderful display piece. My only downside is the slight lack of blue. It works especially well against the original black and blue TIEs, but I have mine on display with my First Order Special Forces TIEs.</p>

<p>I hope this review was helpful and look out for some more of my picture reviews in the near future.</p>
