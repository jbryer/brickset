The construction of the set is rather simple but the result is an intricate tree. I bought this set last Christmas and it has been next to my Model Town House since I built this set earlier this year. It looks like a sculpted piece of art and this set exceeded my expectations. I just wish I had more of this set so I could build larger trees and more of the same tree as well. I just checked LEGO.com and they are not listing this set this year. Last year's snowflake is not being offered this year either which is upsetting. Both of these holiday sets are great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I got one last year and it has proved useful on many occasions. If you buy more than one, you can join em  into a super tree. A definite must have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
