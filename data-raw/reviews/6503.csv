"HQuiff","2009-12-27T07:53:05.483Z","Creativity In Design","I received this small, cute, and beautiful mini-model 2 Days ago for Christmas, to be honest, I received two of these, along with others like the 4899 Tractor, the 5625 Police 4x4 (Two of 'em), 7799 Cargo Copter, and the 7800 Off Road Racer (Another two).

To start with, the build is fun and really gets you thinking something like; ""Oh yeah!"" and ""Those designs are brilliant, I wonder where I could use those."", not to mention, ""Great pieces!"" etc. 

For such a small model this contains a good amount of rare and handy pieces, such as earth green shoe pieces on the tail, and the tan shoes as the feet. And of course odd colouring on cheese slopes never goes amiss. 

The overall mechanisms are always needed on any model (A lot don't have it), and the overall look adds characteristics. Just look at that face!
