"MatrixQuest","2008-10-03T00:46:04.39Z","Some fun everyday...if I could wait that long...","I love these Advent Calendars they do every year.  I always open them all in order as fast as I can put them together, but I still love them...
First off, you get lots of mini-figs.  This set had 10 of them.  Each one is also somewhat unique and that in and of itself makes it great...to get a set that had this many figures normally would be way over $50 and they would all look pretty much alike(i.e. cops, construction guys, etc.)
Then there are the fairly unique accessories.  After you open a day you then get either one or two accessories..to go with that figure.  Sometimes the two accessories can be put together to make the first one even better.  I know this sounds vague...but I don't want to ruin that surprise for those who have more patience than I.
There is one accessory I don't get...I know what the 20th one is and I have a decent guess what 21 is and it goes on 20...but what does that have to do with 19???
Except that one issue I love this set(s).  If they put the leftovers on clearance again this year like last,... I will buy a couple more like I did last year.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-03T12:27:37.013Z","Xmas in the City","My friend brought this back from Germany (also the Castle Advent Calendar, I've reviewed that as well) and let me have a look at it for inspection. It seems that this set is more complete than previous sets and have a proposed scene for each minifig. Let's go through the item inventory for those of you who isn't going to follow the ritual of opening a window each day for 24 days. SPOILER ALERT WARNING.

MINIFIGS
There are a total of 10 minifigs. We'll go through them. The minifigs are numbered in this review and will be used for reference in the next section.

1-Man in tan collar shirt with black wig and chicken drumstick.
2-Beach girl with black ponytail and white ice cream. (What flavor is that?!)
3-Fireman with white hardhat and walkie-talkie.
4-Chef with boat oars. (Actually supposed to be pizza-carrying sticks)
5-Coast Guard diver with snorkels and harpoon gun.
6-Policeman with a camera. (Camera made out of several pieces)
7-Construction guy with red hardhat.
8-Extreme dude in red shirt with grey beanie and pickaxe.
9-Criminal with black beanie and handcuffs.
10-Girl in blue overalls with white 1x1 round piece. (Snowball)

ACCESSORIES
(Please follow minifig numbers above for each accessory)

1-Barbecue pit &amp; table with frying pan and red mug.
2-Cooler box with umbrella &amp; wheeled trolley with white sundae and blue box(?)
3-Cat on a tree &amp; black ladder
4-Cooker hob and brick oven (ironic!)
5-Set of warning buoy, orange flippers and life vest &amp; personal underwater propeller sub.
6-Chair with spotlight. (Interrogation room?)
7-Crate trolley &amp; crate of bottles.
8-Snowmobile
9-No accessories for criminal (confiscated?)
10-Snowman with broomstick and top hat.

I hope you will find this detailed inventory useful. Each of the minifigs have a little scene as I have mentioned earlier and some of them are funny. I find the fireman and cat-in-a-tree situation highly amusing. The snowmobile is awesome! A vehicle in a Advent Calendar set! Also the crate trolley and crate of bottles are superb and well done! If you did not already know, the Snowman has a plain white minifigure head and a minifig's black tophat on it. Also, the policeman's camera is a weird item. A black wine glass is calling substitute for the large bulky lens. Nevertheless, this set is awesome! I am so envious for my friend that got it. I hope you all have fun with this for Christmas this year!

Overall this was a great set to get.  It really allowed for a lot of new generic people for my Lego City without going broke.  10 new minifigs!
I think as an advent calendar, I would was expecting more winter type scenes like the snowmobile and snowman.

I am definitely looking forward to next year's Advent calendar.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
