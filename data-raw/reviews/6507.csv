","Notwithstanding the extra cost and increased brick count of this set over Lego's previous Thomas &amp; Friends starter set, this set is a clear improvement over set 5554. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>As a basic starter, this set includes everything you need for your little builder to have a good train set straight out of the box. &nbsp;There is enough track (at least for a toddler to be able to fit in the middle). &nbsp;The railway&nbsp;accessories&nbsp;are sufficiently varied and functional to allow for multiple play scenarios. &nbsp;Also having two characters allows varied roleplaying. &nbsp;More and better accessories and the addition of a minifig are what have this set beating the more spartan, arguably too spartan, set 5554.</div><div><br></div><div>Looking at the parts in the set I feel they are particularly chosen. The variety of the parts makes the set a great addition to a Duplo collection. &nbsp;The windmill (a little handle to turn), tipping bucket (MOC dump truck) and the pillars on the stop signal (making any house a bit more grand) are particularly handy parts to have for all sorts of Duplo creations. &nbsp;Having two trucks/wagons rather than one (in 5554) can mix up the play a bit, especially if you add more engines later. It is a pity they don't have character faces though. &nbsp;The station is also a nice piece with enough room for a few minifigs to wait for the next train. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>From a Thomas &amp; Friends perspective I like that the set includes the two most important characters - Thomas and the Fat Controller. &nbsp;The windmill is also a good inclusion as it's so&nbsp;recognisable&nbsp;from the TV series. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The limitations of this set are pretty clear. &nbsp;To really have a great train set you'll need more engines and additional track pieces to create something better than a single loop. &nbsp;The main gripe I have with the Thomas &amp; Friends Duplo overall is the lack of more varied track options across the sets. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With all the Thomas &amp; Friends Duplo out of production acquiring your dream train set may be difficult. &nbsp;For a really intricate train set you may be better off with the Thomas wooden railway toys. &nbsp;The current Mega blok Thomas range has good availability but its tracks and the scale of the engines limit its&nbsp;comparability with&nbsp;either&nbsp;the Megablok or Duplo ranges. &nbsp;The obvious advantage of the Duplo Thomas &amp; Friends sets is their&nbsp;comparability with other Duplo so you'll have no trouble creating a lively Island of Sodor even if it doesn't have a&nbsp;tremendously&nbsp;extensive railway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
