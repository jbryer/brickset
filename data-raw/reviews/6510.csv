"jon11380","2008-03-08T06:01:52.67Z","Just about perfect, the first brickset review of the green grocer set","This set is the biggest town/city scale set that i have ever brought and I was not disappointed.  Complete with four mini figs one of which is child like.  There are details galour.  There are giant fridges, cash registers, grandfather clocks, more clocks, bbq,s and eve a pram.

This set is really big.  To help builders each story comes in numbered bags.  Even with the parts divided like this it can still be hard to find the smaller parts to begin with.  This is the first set i have brought for years that includes a inlay box so you can open out the bags without losing anything.  I don't know why lego stopped supplying these boxes.

The front of the model has the bay window, and this looks pretty good and is actually quite strong considering its structure that is made up of numourous hinge plates.  The sand green walls at the front are made up mostly of 1 x 2 grove bricks like from the polce or fire rolling garages.  This creates a paneled affect that does actually make the front more realistic.  The back has the fire escape and again this goes to making the model more realistic, the design of this even includes two harpoons to get the shape near correct.  I think that the colours of this set are realistic as in most old streets you do get variation in building colour.  This model could be lifted from building design in most places in the world.

There is not much to criticise with this model except more furniture would be nice in the upper levels.  Also it woule be good to lift the top flat roof section of like you can on market square, but here it is fixed.  This may be because of the patterned finish on the roof that again adds more detail in this superb model.  More like this please lego.

It costs &#163;100-00 to buy, this is a lot of money.  However it has taken me a week to make with a few hours here, an hour there.  It is an enjoyable build and looks great when nest to market square.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrdoofa","2008-03-18T19:22:20.7Z","Even better than Cafe Corner!","Lego have really surpassed themselves with this beauty of a set. 

The level of detail is simply amazing, on the ground floor you get a tiled floor, 4 letterboxes with mail, a large fully stocked fridge, counter with till, clock, various fruit arranged in various containers in the window display and even a rat with a block of cheese under the stairs! with a hole leading into the shop behind the counter. 

You then move upstairs to the first floor where you will find full height windows complete with curtains and balconies and a detailed fireplace on the far wall. 

On the second floor you have what looks like a rug on the floor made from small tiled pieces, a radiator under the rear window and a rather impressive looking grandfather clock complete with pendulum! there are also detailed balustrades at the top of each staircase. 

On the outside there is a detailed tiled pavement with drain grids, lamppost, fire hydrant  and fruit baskets. Around the back you get a broom, spade , hammer and axe and a full 3 storey foldable fire escape, there is also a barbecue on the top of the building. You also get 4 mini figs one of which is a child with smaller legs and also a lego pram.

This is easily my favourite (so far) in the modular building series and I have thoroughly enjoyed building them all and  cannot wait to see what other ones lego will produce.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mjb","2008-03-22T10:30:20.903Z","Great detail including the inside and round the back","This set is one of the most complete Lego buildings ever. Many complaints people have had with the &quot;Caf&#233; Corner&quot; set and recent houses in the Creator series have been sorted on this set (no interior or details at the back of the building).

The ground floor of the building is tiled through out. The shop includes bins with an assortment of vegetables and bread, two refrigerators fully stocked and a counter with till. Behind the counter is a door leading to the rear of the building where you will find some barrels. The other half of the downstairs is a hallway which includes some mail boxes with mail. The hallway comes out at the back of the building. At the rear there is a small canopy and a couple of wall lights.

The middle floor features a fire place and curtains for the two full length windows at the front. There are three small windows at the rear and a larger one that open on to the fire escape.

The top floor has a large clock, a rug and an old fashioned radiator ( is this the first Lego building with central heating? ). There is also a window at the rear leading to the top of the fire escape. Stairs lead to the roof.

The roof is a much larger section than the &quot;Cafe Corner&quot; set which was just a couple of flat plates. This one has a terrace at the rear with a barbeque, table with sun umbrella and chairs.

When placed next to the &quot;Caf&#233; Corner&quot; set, the &quot;Caf&#233; Corner&quot; looks a little too small. It could do with being a couple of bricks hire. Thats a problem with the 'Caf&#233; Corner&quot; though and not the &quot;Green Grocer&quot;. If you can only afford one set out of the &quot;Caf&#233; Corner&quot;, &quot;Market Street&quot; or &quot;Green Grocer&quot; then the &quot;Green Grocer&quot; is the set to go for. It improves on them in every way.

One complaint, it came with a rat and there is now a vermin problem in Lego town.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Skut","2008-04-15T09:37:27.857Z","Outstanding","Hard to top the previous reviews which are very thorough - except that the roof actually does lift off the top storey and isn't fixed.  

This is the best set so far in the modular series and inproves over the previous offerings due to the addition of floor detail and interiors such as fireplace and grandfather clock.  Lots of food parts for the greengrocer store as well

The minifigs are excellent and combine the classic plain smiley faces with some new hairdos but some classics as well - the top hatted gent seems to be a homage to another great set, 1592 (Town Square from 1980/83).  

It's true there is no furniture as such but this is easily and cheaply added. 

Yes there is a rat problem but Lego has been thoughtful enough to supply a cat to take care of it.  And if that fails there's always the Alpha Team Ratcatcher Squad to deal with it!   

Well worth the money and a fun build of over five hours.

Excellent work, Lego, keep 'em coming!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zac","2008-04-27T19:46:40.56Z","Stunning Between Caf&#233; Corner and Market Street","This is the largest set I have ever bought, ($149.99, &#163;99.99) but it was well worth the price. It contains three floor and the roof deck, four figures, and interior details on all of the floors. 

The ground floor contains a grocery shop, complete with a refrigerator for drinks, frozen food, etc. and a counter with cash register. In the front of the little shop (behind the windows), there are three bins (new for 2008) for carrots, bananas, and croissants. On the sidewalk are two more, larger crates with a head of lettuce and two colors of cherries or grapes. To access the upstairs house or apartment, there is an (extremely steep) staircase, next to several mailboxes. 

The second floor features a fireplace and two small balconies. On the staircase leading up to the third floor, there is a white cat with painted eyes. The third floor is the most elaborate area of the living space in the building, containing a grandfather clock, a rug, and an ingenious radiator. This floor is shorter than the other two, as it is divided into two sections: the actual floor, and the roof with the deck in the back. A staircase leads to the top deck, which has a seating area, and what appears to be a barbeque grill. 

The back of the building supports a fire escape, and a couple of bins for rubbish or spare parts. This is much better compared to Caf&#233; Corner or Market Street, which had no details on the back of the building. 

The price is pretty high, but the set is definitely worth every cent. I just hope Lego makes some smaller (still modular) buildings: I’m not made of money. For now however, I’ve managed to get all three modular buildings, and they look spectacular set up together. Overall, a huge success for Lego, and a set that every town and city devotee should try and get.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2008-07-04T00:03:04.217Z","green with envy","this is officially the most expensive set i have ever bought for town building, and it is worth every penny of it. it is the most aesthetically pleasing building of a timeless architecture to have in your lego neighbourhood, complete with tasteful interior decoration (that includes a grocer fridge filled with milk and juice cartons, a cashier counter, a grandfather clock, a grey radiator, a large thick carpet, a warm fireplace, red post boxes, etc), a playable backyard, an open leisure balcony on the 4th level, a fire escape iron stairway (not sure if that's how u describe it), a white furry cat ready to pounce, a grey timid mouse, and 4 mini-figures, one of which is actually a boy scout! this set will make any lego neighbourhood look proud, and this is what makes lego so wonderful thank you!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Ant","2009-07-23T11:34:35.983Z","Worth the wait","It was a mission and a half for me to get this set but it was well worth it.

I think most of what needs to be said about this set has been said, but I'll point out my favourite parts:

- At first I thought the back of the building was a bit boring and some throw-away design, but after building it I realize that the fire escape and roof deck are beautiful.
- Little features, like the each post box having a letter inside, and the fridge compressor having an exhaust out the back of the building.
- When I first put this together with my Corner Cafe (#10182) I was shocked at how big and how beautiful the combination is.

Now I cant wait for the Fire Brigade (#10197)!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2008-07-26T07:46:18.687Z","I Wish I Could Buy My Fruits and Veggies at Green Grocer!","What an amazing set! This set could not be any better. Think about what the cost of buying this set gets you:
-Hours upon hours of building fun!

-Countless new building techniques (depending on your own building background some of these techniques might not be new but for me, the following were new: using technic pieces to build a radiator, using the garage 1x2 bricks with groove to build the front of the building with the grooves showing, building a bay window, the railings at the top of the stairs use minifig goblets to make the spindles below the handrail, black skeleton minifig legs are used to support the bars going across the top of the building, the fire escape puts my fire escape to shame that I built on my own moc modular building, using inverted slopes to build curtains, the list goes on and on)! 

-the colors the designer Jamie Berard chose for this building are beautiful together. The Sand Green bricks (204 total) from this set are more than the Sand Green that I had in my own collection of bricks and I have 50,000 bricks easily! The tan (149 tan bricks) works with the Sand Green. We even get a nice batch of Dark Green bricks (60 in all) that you don't see when you look at the front of the building. Great selection of realistic building colors that make me want to buy 2 copies of this set!

-you get 64 Cheese Wedge slopes! This is my favorite new piece and you get over 60 of them!

-the interior is not bare like Cafe Corner. You get an amazingly realistic and detailed ground floor that includes a refrigerator of goods, a cash register on top of a counter that has goods below, a mouse eating cheese under the stairs with a mouse hole in a wall, a finely detailed tile layout, fruit baskets and on the 2nd floor you have the curtains in the windows, a fireplace and a railing at the side of the stairway entrance. On the top floor there is a radiator (when I built this I had no idea what it was-I thought it was so cool I called my wife over to have her guess what it was and when it was in place she was impressed as well), and a grandfather clock. Outside the living quarters on the top floor there is a balcony with chairs, a patio table, and a bbq. This is what was missing from Cafe Corner, interior furnishings and the like so the bar was raised a notch with this regard. There could be more pieces of furniture throughout the 2nd and 3rd floors but this would have pushed the price up even higher so I guess sacrifices were made on the inside of the building so the outside could look so awesome! 

-the set is a beautiful display piece and if you are a fan of the Modular Town sets this set looks great next to the others. The designer of this set also designed the Cafe Corner (but not the Market Street set, which was designed by a fan) and from what I have been able to read on the web and in Brickjournal, he is responsible for this new series of buildings. I have all 3 modular town sets plus a MOC all attached and on display atop my computer desk. They look great and I can't wait to add another MOC and the 3rd set from this series to my display. According to an interview with the designer in Brickjournal, this is the 2nd set the designer has planned out of 3. Depending on sales for these sets, he will either be given or denied permission to design a 3rd set.

I truly hope that we get a 3rd set at least from this designer and this series. These sets are designed with us AFOLs in mind and it is up to us to prove that a series aimed at mature fans of LEGO can survive and sell well. I know the cost is prohibitive but as described in my review you get a ton for your money. 2532 pieces, great colors, awesome new building techniques, and inspiration to design and create more buildings like this. If a particular set doesn't inspire you to build more creations like the set, than you miss out on this aspect of LEGO. This set not only is a ton of bricks of harder to find colors, it is also an inspiration for me to create more building like this. What more can you ask for? (besides some furniture on the top floors)!

"TXClark","2009-01-19T21:15:39.857Z","Awsome set!","I finally purchased this set and wow, lot's of great details! Much nicer IMO than the Corner Cafe. The store, cooler/items, floor/tile design, big clock, rug, fire escape, baby buggy, furnace and more. Lot's of details",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mmf72lego","2009-08-02T13:19:39.233Z","Very nice, but not perfect","A few days ago I completed the construction of this set and having found out about it on ""Brickset"" I feel obliged to send in a review (for the first time).

I bought this set as a present for my 37th birthday and was in great anticipation of it. After construction I must admit it looks awesome from the outside and building it up was great fun. The construction of the separate sections is solid and the colors and materials (sort of bricks) are well chosen and in good balance with each orther.

So why only 4 out of 5 you'd ask? Well I'll try and explain from the groundfloor up: Great looks out- and inside the shop with nice details on the furniture and lots of groceries! The passage to the backyard and the entry to the staircase are well built; nice lamps outside and cool letterboxes in white and red. 

But than we go up and arrive on the first floor! Lots of space here, but the only actual piece of furniture is the indeed very nice looking fireplace. Enough room for some more furniture I'd say! Why not throw in some kind of cuboard or a little desk in the rightside (seen from the front)!? Near the fireplace a little easy-chair and some sort of floorlamp would do great (I can see the shopkeeper read a book there and having a glass of wine after a long day of work ;-) And there is easily even more room! When I'd finished the first floor I was caught by the nice cornerspace in front of the stairs leading to the second floor. I'm already designing a spare room with a lego toilet and a tiny fitted basin myself. And how about putting railing on the stairs as well? Would make the very nice stair gates look even greater? 

On the second floor I'v less comments because over here are at least 3 really nice bits of furniture: the clock (a little big though, and why is it fixed to the wall?), the radiator (very cool design with such simple means) and the rug (nice colors). But again; enough space for some more and my design for a bed is coming up! As for the staircase, same thing as before: gates would give it the finishing touch and real grandure!

The roofpart is very nice indeed, I can see the BBQ working ;-)
and the flowerbaskets give it a bright look. The design on the roofrails with the hamers is neat!

IN ALL: a very neat set, that forms a excelent platform to fill in with a handfull of extra idea's! But as I bought this one instead of the other 2 (Cafecorner and Marketstreet) beceause I read here their interior was more or less ""empty"", my hopes where maybe a little to high up for this one!
So 4 out of 5 is very nice. But it aint perfect.

P.S. In time I'll see if I can load up my designs for the pieces of furniture I'm going to add! My parts for a bookcase are already on the way from LEGO.

The set is split up in 3 different floors and a roof, instructions seperated over 3 different booklets.

Building the first floor I already thought the set was worth the money. The little shop is full of awesome details. I love the way everything looks as if Lego didn't want any compromises in the design.

The other two floors are a great build as well, although they're more empty. The clock design was one that caught me by surprise. The clock and some other designs let you wonder what the hell you're building untill the very las moment where you just go: Oh wow, this is awesome!

The only downside are the stairs at the back, which are a little too much of a gathering of bizarre bricks to make it look like a fire escape. It's just too random to be as awsome as the clock or the features in the shop.

Pros:
- Great looking building, really... wow!
- Incredible details
- Great susprises during building (oh that's what I was building!)
- Every single sceptic friend understood my passion after seeing this!
- No compromises in design, everything is made to look good

There is also a hole in the wall, leading to an area under the apartment's stairs, where a mouse and a piece of cheese are.<br><br>In the mail room, you find 4 mail slots. There are a couple flaws in this area. First, to get from the front to the back of the building, you squeeze through a really tight space of about 2 1/2 studs wide between the door to the apartments, and the end of the mail slots, to access the courtyard. It is an annoyingly tight squeeze. Secondly, no bricks were included to cover up the bottom of the staircase. (Seeing the mouse out in the open is a bit awkward)<br><br>The front of the building has nice little touches such as the lights in front of the mailroom, 2 brick walls on each side of the arch in front of the mailroom, bins of produce, etc. There are also 2 balconies. No flaws here.<br><br>The second floor has a fireplace. That's it. So unimpressive that I am working on a custom interior. I'm planning on having a kitchen, dining room and living room on this floor, things that this set could have used. This floor is not tiled either.<br><br>Worth mentioning is the fire escape ladder. Much sturdier than expected. The use of harpoon guns as railings is a bit distracting though, even if they do work well here.<br><br>The third floor is also bare, with a clock, rug and AC unit. On this floor I am adding a bedroom/bathroom. Once again no tiles.<br><br>The roof top has a balcony, with a table, 2 chairs, and barbecue. A little on the small side, but great nonetheless. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Here are Pros and Cons:</span><br><br>Pros:<br><br>- Great Parts Pack<br>- Some interior details<br>- Figures actually pretty cool<br>- SAND GREEN<br>- Design<br><br>Cons:<br><br>- Bare interior/Sloppy areas<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall:<br><br></span>Design: 9.5/10<br>Price: 10/10 (Price is Justified)<br>Playability: 9/10 (I like making it Palpatine's green grocer, with Kit Fisto as a cashier!

<p>I have a friend who has this set and boy it's amazing! It is incredible how detailed and elaborate the actual building is. One of&nbsp;the best&nbsp;things is you can use the bottom level for the green grocer and the other levels for vitually anthing else, like a hotel, a resturant or even a corporate function building ( although I do like the hotel the best.</p>

"legodude357","2011-04-12T10:14:18.243Z","My only (so far) and first modular building!","I received this two years ago for Christmas. I find it surprising I have yet to write a review on it. As this is my largest lego set so far, and the center piece of my collection!<br><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box feels kind of bland to me. Although something misleading on the back made me a bit mad. The back shows all the furniture pieces included with the set. Upon building the model, I found that the furniture was built into the wall, yet cleverly disguised so the outer bit of the house was not discoloured. The instructions had a few mistakes, but as an expert builder I easily corrected them.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>You receive a plethora of basic bricks and plates, and I'd bet you could come up with very attractive models of your own with these. Even though they are quite basic, most are specialized with a depressed area in the middle, or certain pieces used in neat ways not thought of.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I can't quite recall the minifigures included, because they are what I call, 'junk-people'. Minifigures that don't fit anywhere in my collection, their torso head and leg combo's are hideous, or are the 'extras' included by lego to justify the price. I have a small three drawer plastic organizer that I part out un-wanted figures. Probably the only minifigure part I like best is the top hat. Before now, I had never had one before. You also get a cat piece, which was my first.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I stretched the build over three days. The first day was actually about an hour. I built the bottom floor at midnight after we got home from a Christmas party at a relatives (where I received this as a gift!). I just couldn't wait for morning to assemble it. I found one missing part at this stage. A 1x1 light gray brick. I substituted for a black one until I found one in a later stage and replaced that one with the black as it was less noticeable. Also, underneath the stairs on the first floor is a rat and a piece of cheese, as well as a mailbox and four envelopes!<br></p><p>The next day I built the second floor. It was probably the most interesting part of the build. There were windows, a fire escape, a fireplace, etc. This part of the build was where I got that 1x1 gray block from and substituted for the black as it was on the interior and less noticeable. Also, there is a small hidey-place for the cat. It's on the stairs, right under the next floor.</p><p>The third floor was less interesting and by this time I was quite bored. This floor was missing a piece, but I have since forgot what it was. Oh! I was just about to review a neat rug on the third floor and I remembered the piece. It was a 2x2 dark tan tile. I was able to rip one off of the Indiana Jones Crystal Skull Temple, which has since been majorly parted out, and replace the missing piece. A set of stairs leads to...</p><p>The roof! This area was missing a piece too. (it seems on each floor a piece was missing!) A gray 2x8 plate that was needed to form the skeleton of the roof. I found a dark gray one but have since found a colour match to replace it. The roof has a very nice railing across it, ingeniously conceived with black skeleton legs and hammers. Imagine that! There is also the tip of the white spire that is continued on from the other two floors, and a nice feather decoration atop it. Leading out the stairs from below, your minifigures are greeted by a red BBQ grill, which can open and close and has a spatula on the side. Luckily, this was one of the furniture pieces that was removable. You also stumble upon a patio with two swivel seats and an umbrella. Hanging over the balcony is two potted plants. The only thing I have to criticize is the view. Who wants to look at the back of the green grocer? Its run down and has plants growing up the walls. As well as the ugly fire escape (from a minifigures point of view of course!) and three trash cans.<br></p><p></p><h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is stunningly breath taking-ly amazingly awesome sauce! It is my biggest lego set and the center of my collection. Every day I notice a new detail I've never seen before. Which is weird because I built it. I very much enjoy waking up to see this model, and it is very sturdy. I've never dropped it, yet that is, but I feel only minimal damage will occur.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>My summary of this model is that if you missed out on it, your out of luck! I really enjoyed it but feel its not for everyone. It reaches out and grabs collectors like me and becomes our greatest lego kit ever. For others, that enjoy playing with their kits, this would not be for them. You can barely fit your hands in the separate floors. The roof and front sidewalk is where most of the playing is going to go on. For my friends, I would not recommend it. But you may be different. You may like to build and display your sets. If so, by all means pay those prices on amazon and eBay for it! The people I know would not be able to complete the model, nor be able to appreciate it.</p><p>All in all, if your serious about legos, I dearly recommend this. If your a parent shopping for your children, unless they take care of their stuff (like I do) then don't buy this. They would be much more contempt with a battle pack or something with swooshability. Something they feel good about disassembling and creating their own models with.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed this review, and thank you for reading! Happy legos!</p><p><br></p><p>~legodude357<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"av8r1973","2011-01-18T11:15:31.41Z","Spectacular looking, great build - expensive","<p>The title pretty much sums this set up. It truly is a masterpiece of LEGO construction.&nbsp; There are dozens of clever and ingenious build techniques that I never could have thought of (turret roof on the 3rd floor, the radiator on the 3rd floor, cooler on the 1st floor, baby buggy,&nbsp;for examples)&nbsp; Each time I hit one, I thought, ""wow, that was cool!"".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a standalone kit, I am not sure the shock value would be there.&nbsp; Pair it with the Fire Brigade or Grand Emporium, and you have a solid winner.&nbsp; I paired it with both (after I sold my first-born to come up with the cash).&nbsp; I put all three buildings in the middle of my train set and now feel I need to find the old train station and the Emerald Night to finish the scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exterior of the building is incredibly detailed.&nbsp; Fruit baskets, mansored roof, bay walls, turret roof - everything a downtown shop/apartment building should have.&nbsp; Each floor is uniquely different, just like the real one would be.&nbsp; Color selection was impeccable.&nbsp; Slate grey, slate green, white and beige account for most of the building, while the store awning is contrasting blue and white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interiors were unfurnished.&nbsp; Yes, you can make your own furniture, but why should you have to at this price?&nbsp; Add another 1 or 2 hundred pieces to furnish the floor.&nbsp; Drive the per-piece price down a bit to make it a better value, and you have a perfect kit.&nbsp; The fireplace on the 2nd floor was unique and the grandfather clock on the 3rd floor was very cool to build and looks great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, my reintroduction to LEGO was well after this kit hit the insanely expensive mark.&nbsp; We paid about US$280 here in Taiwan for it.&nbsp; By far, the most expensive kit we have.&nbsp; I would gladly pay the same for Market Street, but that's only a down payment on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can find a fair price on this kit - get it.&nbsp; Open it and build it.&nbsp; Play with it and enjoy it.&nbsp; You won't be disappointed.&nbsp; Because of the price, my daughters won't be playing with this one.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,4

"zipsforbananas","2013-05-24T10:16:59.26Z","Essential for any expanding street (pity it's so expensive now!)","<p>This glorious building is rightly expensive (I've not seen one go for less than £300) and hard to find since it was discontinued, it's no surprise demand is outstripping supply, owners really shouldn't want to part with it!</p><p>It hardly has to be said about a modular set but <b>the build</b> is superb. It has fewer of what you would consider advanced techniques than most other modulars, but the hinged bay window as well as the grocer shop door and US style fire escape are in that sort of ball park. The base of the bay seems a little clumsy by later standards, but it's by no means bad. The fireplace and grandfather clock, as well as the little BBQ are nice features to build, and I absolutely love the fridge in the shop!<br>There are plenty of nice little touches too, the lights by the apartment entrance and at the back, the spire-roof and the feathers on the tip, the railings made with skeleton legs and hammers, and the general face of the building is really nicely rendered.<br>And the best things about it all is how sturdy the whole thing is. It seems a bit obvious in building a house, but it is well put together with bricks overlapping well throughout. The parts that are awkward for this, the columns of grooved bricks, are integrated well. The obvious issue with modulars this size is that they are 32 studs long, but there's no hint of weakness in the upper floors' width with good bracing of the floor the strong walls.</p><p><b>The parts</b> you get are great, or more relevantly now, rare and hard to find! The sand green 1x8 bricks that are vital to the structure of the 1st and 2nd floors, the black 2x2x2 slopes that make up the roof, the brown parts, and especially the sand green 1x2 bricks with the groove are all very hard to find on bricklink in the quantities you need them or at a reasonable price. Because of all of those there's not a huge difference between buying one for £400 or part sourcing it yourself; I've a feeling part sourcing is actually quite a bit more expensive because of those and the larger plates, especially when actually owning the instructions will set you back at least £30.<br>So that's a great feature if you have one or can get one cheaply, but now it's delisted it makes it more expensive! Shame!</p><p><br>As you will have picked out already, <b>the finished model</b> is just superb!</p><p>The ground floor is truly magnificent, the grocer's shop is just so well made, and the apartment entrance is nice too. The tiling on the floors is possibly the best in any set - the apartment pattern looks great and flowing out into the street, and the design in the grocer's shop is delightful! The shop is brilliantly detailed with the crates outside, boxes within, the wonderful fridge, and the stock around the till. The cans and cartons in the fridge, plus the fruit, veg and croissants really make it. And the apartment entrance feels just like a concrete set of stairs should with the 2x6 bricks, and the mouse under the stairs with a hole into the shop is good too.</p><p>The first floor is quite sparse, but the balconies, the really brilliant curtains, and the great fireplace are enough for me. A sofa or two aren't so hard to make either if you're part sourcing anyway. The face of the building looks great with all the grooved bricks as well, even the white bricks round the window where you can hardly see the groove.</p><p>The top floor seems fuller with the really funky rug, the clock and the fantastic radiator under the window. The way the roof starts part way up and the way the bay finishes with the spire give it a very grand feel.</p><p>And the roof is great, making the roof in the 2nd floor really high and continuing the Gothic feel. My only criticism is that the balcony seems a little gloomy because of that, not exactly the carefree place to relax it should be.</p><p><br>There are a few things that I think could be improved. Just rotating the base plates gets rid of the needless gap in the back yard, and enough bricks go across the join that it doesn't hurt the integrity. The gap under the stairs with the mouse really needs so plates to stop it being green. And as I mentioned (and so has everyone else!) some custom furniture, copied from the later modulars maybe, wouldn't hurt. But for a set this big that's hardly much.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Superb looks, styling and presence</li><li>Brilliant detailing in the store, possibly the best in any set</li><li>Fantastic to build, engaging throughout</li><li>A great amount of rare parts, which is a pro, but...</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>...the rare parts make it very pricey now it's delisted - if you see it under £300, buy it!</li><li>Just a few niggles with the clumsy beginning to the bay window and empty upper floors</li><li>And it's the fault of the styling, but the balcony is rather gloomy!</li></ul>
<p>A superb set, unfortunately hard to find as any modular street would be so much the poorer for not having it. There are a few clues as to its age, but the shop is second to none, the flooring is superb and the stock is marvellous. The figures fill it out well too, fitting quite nicely, but again, if you're part-sourcing it, they're quite hard to get. At £100 for 2,350 bricks it was an absolute steal, but it ain't that cheap no more! Pity, eh!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<div>
<p>5/5. This is a fantastic modular build (as all have been in my opinion).&nbsp; Green Grocer may be missing some of the interior micro-builds that others have, but the overall experience does not suffer in my opinion.&nbsp; It&#39;s a huge structure when finished and seems to dwarf my nearby Parisian Restaurant.&nbsp; The sand green really stands out as well.&nbsp; Just an overall amazing and massive structure.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>Although I have all the modulars from Pet Store through Diner, it&#39;s been over a year since I put one together.&nbsp; When I saw a used one for sale at original cost, I had to pick this one up.&nbsp; This is really a great build.&nbsp; It may just be personal preference, but some similar sets seem to have sections that require placing a ton of similar small pieces or are overloaded with interior details (looking at you fishing store).&nbsp; Green Grocer does not suffer from this problem.&nbsp; The repetitive portions of this build might be placing the sand green and grey bricks, but that&#39;s so satisfying that it&#39;s not even a negative.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>High marks for parts as well.&nbsp; The sand green 8x1 and 2x1 modified bricks are quite rare and also brilliant looking in my opinion.&nbsp; Worth $2.50 a brick?&nbsp; Maybe not, but they are fantastic.&nbsp; Other than that, mostly common parts and pieces, but certainly a lot of them for the price of $150.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>My kids seem to love playing with the modulars and this one would be no different.&nbsp; Lack of much of an interior might seem to affect it, but it would be an easy change to add some furniture.&nbsp; This building makes a fine addition to the city and playability is still high with 3 stories and a good first floor grocery and top floor grilling balcony.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>Great price per part with over 2000 parts for $150 and a fantastic build for the time.&nbsp; I picked this one up for $150 with the intention of selling it in my Bricklink store as they go for $600+&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I almost wish I hadn&#39;t built it...&nbsp; Parting with it will be hard.</p>

"Elisburg","2022-03-03T21:29:04.747Z","VERY Detailed, but hard to find and VERY Expensive","<p>This set does look really good and is a classic modular building. It is one of the most detailed sets and does have a large piece count. This does include MANY sand green pieces and a few rare pieces such as a hair piece that is worth over $25.&nbsp; This has 4 minifigs that are classic for the time.</p>

<p>Pros and Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looks nice and highly detailed&nbsp;</p>

<p>Get a lot of uncommon and rare parts&nbsp;</p>

<p>Around 14 inches tall&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>REALLY EXPENSIVE 700-900 dollars used and 1,000-1,500 new.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It looks really nice in a row of modular buildings, though. I&#39;m glad I got this for my city, just you need a high budget.&nbsp;</p>
