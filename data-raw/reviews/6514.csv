"GreatBear","2008-03-12T17:43:49.06Z","Value for Money?","Five fun little figures and weapons, certainly. But I have ask - if the Star Wars Battle Packs are over priced at 4 figures and vehicle for $13 (Canadian) what can we say about 5 figures for $18? I had thought since it had far few pieces and was not a licensed set it might be cheaper than the Star Wars packs - I was not prepared for $5 more!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-21T11:23:32.95Z","Could be better, it have just 43 pieces for US$12.99 ","This set is a small set of the castle theme, released in this year. Like the old minifigure packs of the castle theme, this includes minifigures to increase your army. The five minifigures (and the little spider, too) are useful. All of the minifigures are skeletons, like these included in the sets of the current castle theme, but in sets from yesteryear (the castle of this year includes more some trolls, not skeletons). The design is good, altough the old skeleton shape and face were better, in movements, likeness and color scheme. One of the minifigures is a normal skeleton (but with the movements of the new skeletons), with no armors, but with a flail and a shield. Another minifigure included is a skeleton warrior made by the normal shape of minifigures, but with the skeleton head (not the original, the face have some different designs, features red eyes, and isn't scary, the old were more, without red eyes). This skeleton warrior have a metallic painted armor and helmet, the same of the minifigure of the rogue knight dracus (released with some sets from the knights kingdom theme, in 2006). This have a two bladed axe and a shield, too. Another minifigure is the skeleton, without armors, like the first, but with a black cover, made by two pieces (the cover is also used in some minifigures of sith lords), and it is increased with a scythe, made by a piece with the shape of a stick, combined with a sword, that makes the weapon still in a good size. Other skeleton included, is another with the original minifigure body, but with a new skeleton head. Increased by a helmet and a armor with some black and silver details, this have too a shield and a spear. Another minifigure is a simple skeleton, with a crossbow and a shield, it have the different black color, but it still good. The spider &quot;minifigure&quot; (just a piece), is useful to turns the castle sets more scary, but it could be replaced by a armoured or winged skeleton of a horse. The set is useful and the color schemes are nice (but some details like the eyes makes the design silly). But it includes few pieces to the price, it is more expensive than the star wars battle packs and other old castle minifigure packs, altough these includes more pieces than this. Altough useful, it isn't the best way to get minifigures. 3/5 due to the number of pieces, design (the old castle minifigures, altough simple, were so better in the design), and of course, the price. US$12.99 isn't a good price for this set. So, buy other packs with minifigures  and more pieces is the best option.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"knuclear200x","2009-07-14T22:24:21.06Z","""The Kingdom of Greyskull will be ours Muhahahaha!"" *Smush*","Why did I say 6 knights in my last review?! SIX?! I meant FIVE!  WHHHHHHHHHHYwhen I bought this set, I was surprised by how much the skeleton minifigure has changed. Gone are the ball-joint wobbly arms now and hopefully forever. If only you could turn their wrists too. Also two of the skeletons have regular bodies with armor. 

The weapons are...okay. Weapons like the axe and the scythe are just two-three pieces put together. The scythe is good but the axe just looks kinda dumb. The helmet and armor looks very nice, but the small protrusions on the shoulders keep the helmet from fastening itself to the head, making it loose. The set also comes with a spider. There's also a cloth cape, and a stiff chain flail.

Pros:
An excellent skeleton/zombie army builder. The skeletons themselves don't really need weapons, except for the ones with the regular bodies. Mainly because skeletons look better in a swarm without weapons cuz thats how its always been, right? Right? Ah forget you...

Cons:
The Axe looks stupid. Shoulda got a real axe.
The helmet doesn't go well with the armor because of the tiny protrusions on the shoulders.

Overall:
It's a great army builder, and worth buying in bunches if you like buying drones of baddies attacking a castle or headquarters. Like I said in the Knights review, it's worth the price for five figures as other sets dont offer as much minifig-wise.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jeroenaa95","2012-05-31T03:35:52.397Z","great army builder, bit too expensive.","<p>I got this set in Legoland Billund, in 2009. My parents bought it for me. I think it is a bit too expensive, but to me it was a present :). I got it with the Knights Battle pack, so that they can fight eachother. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>- 5 awesome skeletons: 1 black skeleton with crossbow and shield, 1 white skeleton with a mace and a shield, 1 white skeleton with hood, cape and scythe, 1 well armored skeleton with a double bladed axe and 1 well armored skeleton with a large spear.</p>
<p>- 1 cool spider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>- bit too expensive.</p>
<p>- you do need the other battle pack, if you want to have a large battle.</p>

<p>Overall an awesome set.</p>",TRUE,4,5,2,5,3
