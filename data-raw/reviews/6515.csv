WHERE?! now he'll just fall in the mud and get laghed at. poor guy. but he does have some realy cool aurmur. and a big shild.4. this guy looks just like the lead general, other than not having his head.he has his sword, his shild, and his aurmur, but hes not him.5. this one is the archer with a knights helmet, so i think the pikesmen stole his helmet. but he does have a crosbow and some arows, so thats good cuz hes one of the only two archers this year. so, if you have the money, and nothing else you plan to buy with it, i think you should get this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-07-15T12:02:22.437Z","Knights minifigure pack (it don't needs be a battle pack)","This set is a minifigure pack, named as a battle pack due to the knights' armors and weapons, that can be used in any minifigure in original shape to make these ready to battle scenery. The battle pack have five minifigures with different heads and some repeated parts, altough with different weapons. They are common in the new theme of castle, known as fantasy era due to the introduction of armies that aren't humans, like the trolls, dwarves and skeletons. This pack is of human knights and is useful on the theme due to the common minifigures.

One of the common minifigures is one with the face of the king, but with a helmet very common for archers, but this in the place have a glaive (named in the website of the theme, castle.lego.com) with a golden flag on it. The other knight have another common helmet, this have another face that still common in the theme, his weapon is the spear, and his body is too used in the theme, and by extension, it is useful currently. The third knight have a lance (known sometimes as spear), with a blue flag on this. Have an armor above the body and have an useful helmet, used on the old sets. The face is another different, this have a beard. The other knight on the pack, that looks like be the general, actually have another face, common on castle, city and mars mission themes. This have the helmet and armor that makes he looks like the general, but this isn't. The sword and his equipments were used on old and classic castle sets, what makes this more useful. The last knight is who have the crossbow, with the same helmet of the second knight, but this have another face and weapon (the crossbow, of course), and have too a detailed piece to put under his head, to looks like the arrows, it isn't different of old sets, only the face and the details. The details of the crown and armors with silver, golden, and blue are very repeated on this theme, also in dwarves, this is useful currently, but don't looks like with other lego castle and knights that had too great details. The sword is chromed, but nothing new, it was common to sets of bat lord from fright knights, so it can be useful too, but new it isn't. The knights have the same legs, and with the colors and details, they looks like very useful to them but don't very to other castle themes. 

The set isn't bad at all, but the price is. One fact is that have very few pieces (35 pieces), less than bionicle with these costs (and bionicle have normally very big pieces in comparison with this). It don't comes with horses or any small cart, so it don't justify the price. Also SW packs are more cheap than this (and SW sets are normally more expensives due to the royalty of the Star Wars name), but this is more expensive. The price maybe is due to it's pack, that isn't that great. Always minifigure packs came in boxes, these had to be builted, now it cames builted in another type of pack. But still, once that the minifgures are easy to change parts and are in the normal shape. The playability of the set is the normal playability of any minifigure. So, due to the price, it is a 2,5/5, if you wants this set, maybe you can awaits more, or if you have the money and don't know on what you will use it, you can choose other set, or pack. This set is close to be a rip-off, it have 35 pieces and costs very. This have less than the packs of SW. In the description of the set, the knights are heroic knights. But of course you can create your own story to this set and to your knights or any minifigures, including dwarves, skeletons and trolls, you don't need to use the same story that lego gave to the set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"knuclear200x","2009-07-14T21:28:31.297Z","A Fifteen Dollar Army Builder","I was surprised when I went to the local Lego Store and found these babies. Minifigs are essentially what makes Lego sets cool. They aren't fully-articulated or have special action features, but they're soooo adorable and extremely useful. Too bad they're rarely sold in your local TRU or supermarkets by themselves.

So we have 6 knights in this assortment. Uh...I don't know what the knight positions are so I'll just say they have the Archer, the flag guy, the spear guy, the Jouster and leader in shining armor. Each are equipped with their appropriate weaponry and two of them wear armor plates. The coolest would be the shining armor knight with the flip-up helmet visor and silver sword.

It's a useful set as an army builder and an armory collection, but how is the price? Well...in my opinion, $15 isn't so bad. For about that much, you only get 2 figures and two small or one big vehicle. Sometimes that's a better deal, but dangit you want these 6 guys and their cool weapons and armor. They're practically yelling under the plastic package saying ""BUY US! BUY US NOW! FREE US FROM OUR VINYL PRISON!""

Pros:
6 guys with armor and weapons

Cons:
The flag guy's spear is bent slightly due to packaging (seen above left)
The flip up visor helmet would've been cool if it weren't so loose.

Overall:
Buy it if you don't need vehicles or extra bricks at the moment. It's like buying 6 small action figures for the price of two taller ones without those darn twist ties. If you love it a lot, buy 2 boxes.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"vincent_vda","2008-12-30T07:58:49.077Z","Nice but expensive","Cool figures at a slightly higher price. But still worth getting.

I wanted to spice up my knights collection without spending too much cash on a new castle or something so this was a less expensive (believe it or not) solution.

Very nice figures. I'd have given 5/5 if the price was a little less (maybe due to packaging but what does that suit - you just rip it open!!).",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"rainstorm26","2009-08-14T19:08:44.06Z","Good for army building","I bought this set from my Lego store for several reasons.

#1.  The store wanted $9 to build your own minifig from some really bad pieces (that's $3 each).  Therefore, this set was much cooler and the same price per minifig.

#2.  They discontinued it on lego.com.  So if I wanted to have a few extra knights for my scenes, it would be much more difficult to acquire.

I am really glad I bought it, because they then came out with the Troll battle pack.  Now I can fight the knights vs. trolls (which is much better than knights vs. skelletons).

Pro's:  Two knights in full armor.  Chrome sword.  Shields.

Con's:  Needs another sword.  Not a big fan of the helmets (the type that have two in the battle pack).  Not a big fan of archers.

<p>- 5 minifigures: 1 archer, 1 general with a shiny sword and large shield, 1 soldier with lance and large shield, 1 soldier with a large spear with flag&nbsp;and small shield and 1 soldier with spear and small shield.</p>
<p>- great army builder, €14,99 for 5 soldiers with lots of weapons.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>
<p>- bit to expensive, should be €12,00 at most. </p>
<p>- no more cons.</p>

<p>Overall, a great set, little building experience, because the soldiers are allready build.</p>
<p>That's it for this set.</p>",TRUE,4,5,2,5,3
