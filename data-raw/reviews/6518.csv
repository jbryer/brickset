"ChefAgf","2008-09-20T09:26:43.577Z","Great Set","The Taj Mahal arrived in the usual shipment box. When i opened that box another plain brown box came out of the package. In That box was the official 10189 set (in a box. And when i opened that one, three seperate cartons came out with the bagged pieces. So thats a lot of space to sort pieces, and believe me with 5922 pieces you need it!

First thing i noticed was that there were just 6 32x16 baseplates. there are no plates in the center of the set. The manual is divided in 3 books and is clear as usual. Only thing i noticed is that some blue parts are purple in the books.

So we start building. Its absolutely not too hard to build, as you build 1 baseplate at a time and you click them together afterwards to complete the ground floor. The second floor does the same. 

What i noticed was that altough the dome is quite heavy and there are no studs under it, just the roof, it is really stable. you need to push really hard to crash it. Building doesn't get repetative and is not difficult.

Im not gonna tell much more about the building cause you really need to do that yourself. You will enjoy it.

Some interesting facts:

You divide the completed set in pieces very easily to transport.
If you can exhibit the Taj Mahal in your living room, put a light in it! Its hollow and with all the glazed parts it looks really nice.

To conclude:

If you like the eiffel tower and the statue of liberty sets, this one is a must have for you. If you dont, well it still has a lot of pieces you can use. 

Im giving this 5 stars cause it has a lot of pieces, its fun to build and the result is amazing. I cant think of any bad things in this set. Have fun!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-11-15T13:49:05.187Z","A MUST HAVE","This set is absolutely great. Good size, good build, good price, what more could you want? One thing I would like to point out though is that Chef Ag's review of this set says that the building is not repetitive, but I fully disagree and would say that this set is even more repetitive than the ucs imperial star destroyer or the Eiffel tower. But the moment I finished the set all thoughts of repetition left my mind. The set is pretty big once its fully connected and is extremely detailed all around. The towers on the four corners of the base are a little wobbly, but the rest of the set is stable. The dome on top uses sphere-building techniques that many professionals use in creating lego land models, and it was real exciting to be able to use those techniques in a lego set for once. The inside of the base, closed in by the walls, is hollow, so two blue base plates (like the ones used in the set) put together will form a base where you can build whatever you want inside the Taj. This set contains the largest number of pieces ever released in a lego set, beating the UCS Millenium Falcon. However, the UCS Falcon is still the largest set in size to be released. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;",FALSE,5,4,5,1,5

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway lets get to the review;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Box</p>
<p>The box is huge and totally filled with lego's, so no air there, I think this is set is pushing the limits of cardboard packaging in general and I am curious to find out if Lego will go beyond this piececount in a traditional Lego Packaging. I carried this set for 3 weeks and I can tell you it is heavy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unpacking</p>
<p>after getting back from vacation I waited a few weeks before the assembly of this set, I decided not to open all bags but instead I only opened a bag when I needed the part or ran out of parts. this way I minimised the sorting time, this is my first advise in building any large Lego model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assembly</p>
<p>It took several weeks to build this set with my girlfriend, we built the set section by section,the base was the least attractive part of the build.</p>
<p>The central upper part of the building is nice to do. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After completion</p>
<p>I have the Taj Mahal sitting on a special table in my living room, it truely is very nice to have and to look at, and indeed you can expect allot of remarks when you have visitors. There is no playvalue what so ever and that is expected offcourse. If you get tired of it I would suggest building other buildings as suggested by Asembler's review. I am not tired of it yet but am thinking of building a sort of Gran Central Station tat will go with my Lego trains.</p>

A lot of repetition, especially the middle walls. But i enjoyed putting the corners into place when a section is done. Basically, its 4 x of everything. Its very very tiring but well worth it in the end. The transparent mid walls uses clear 1x1 bricks which must be carefully done as intermittently, a colored brick is used. 

The four corner minarets are simple and easy to do. 

The colors of the bricks are very nice to look at. Touch of blue and yellow here and there are well thought of.

The Dome construction must be done so with care and its tedious. Good techniques are used (SNOT). If not carefully followed, the spherical effect will not be there. 

Overall, the largest number of bricks used in a set is due to the fact that small pieces are used and this is the reason for the model being very detailed.

GREAT SET!

"IndianGuardian","2010-12-04T16:17:22.17Z","Great for Display! Not Playable.","I bought this from the USA and had it shipped all the way to India (and got jacked in the shipping cost). But it was all worth it. Of the 120 sets I have built, this has been the most fun till date. The construction is fairly challenging and a family can build the set together (though would recommend &nbsp;newbies try a few simple sets and then try this).<div><br></div><div>The best part is the final model. It looks amazing. What we did was put a glass wall behind it and a multi-color LED on top. The end result is very beautiful.</div><div><br></div><div>The con? If you want to call it that, it is that you cannot use it to play or integrate with other Lego sets. This is purely a display set to make your visitors go wow! Amongst all the landmark sets, this is the best till date.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,1,5
"mayaseye","2010-11-15T19:29:31.117Z","It's a great set to build.","This was a great build! &nbsp;Lots of pieces, lots of time. &nbsp;The only problem I had with it was it's enormous size. &nbsp;I knew building it, that it would be a very large set but it really did take up a lot of room, so I took it down about a week after I finished it. &nbsp;I do love the huge sets because they take so long to build, and you can have all the fun of building it for much longer than the smaller sets. &nbsp;This is one of those sets that you only leave up if you have the room to do so. &nbsp;I definitely recommend this set for those who love to build!",FALSE,5,5,5,4,4
"Stromeon","2011-02-07T13:09:48.87Z","Wonderful building experience","<p>This is a brilliant set and although it took a long time to build, it was very fun.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A lot of fun to be had while building</li><li>It looks absolutely magnificent when finished</li><li>It looks amazingly similar to the real thing when viewed from a distance</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Sorting all the bricks out at the start take absolutely ages, there are loads and loads of bags which aren't numbered or sorted</li><li>Some bits, especially the dome are very fiddly</li></ul>
<p>Although the set is not at all interactive and is best just for viewing, I have staged quite a few battles on it (top tip: the top of the minarets make good sniping posts).</p><p>For people who like building large-scale projects which take a while but look amazing at the end, this is an absolute must</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,2,5
