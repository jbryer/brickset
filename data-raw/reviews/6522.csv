"Doctor_Sinister","2008-09-14T11:26:31.733Z","The ultimate playset for your minifigs.","Having spent the last three days building this monster, I am very pleased with the results.  This is an incredible set, containing a myriad of cool workable features and an awesome array of minifigs to inhabit it.

It's super-sturdy, very nice to behold and wonderful to play with - the thought that has gone into each feature is clearly a labour of love.  It's possible to re-enact virtually every Death Star related scene from either episode IV or VI of the original Star Wars trilogy.

Some of the minifigs have new printing on their torsos, and figures such as the Death Star trooper and the black protocol droid are entirely new.  The Emperor has a new, psychotic, face and Vader has very detailed printing.  Vader's mini TIE X1 is also lovely, and he even fits inside, with a squeeze.

This set is worth every penny - 100% recommended.

"yodaccm","2008-09-16T21:12:48.45Z","Worth Every Penny...","When I finally received this monstrous Lego set the other day, I knew it was going to be a supreme undertaking.  Just opening the box to this sucker I realized I had my work cut out for me.  Within the main box were 4 smaller boxes, each containing enough pieces to construct a big Lego Star Wars set.  Then I pulled out the instruction &quot;manual&quot; and was truly in awe.  It's heft was alone made me rethink what I was about to undergo.  Coming in around 260 pages and spiral bound, it takes nearly 200 steps to put this battle station together.  And what a thrill it was the three evenings it took me to finish.  

One previous review suggested you sort out your pieces.  I can't agree more with that suggestion as your supply of Lego bricks is massive and to find that one specific piece is maddening and will bring your construction to a screeching halt.  But all in all, the build is good, has plenty of variety, and the design is great.

Not only does the Death Star have around 16 different rooms representing important scenes from the movies, but each room has a special feature, e.g. a moving platform, or secret passage, switches, levers, etc.  It is chock full of little details that will delight any fan of the Star Wars movies or Legos.  The attention to these details is perfect and really takes this set to the next level of design.

It also comes with a multitude of minifigs.   Included are the Emperor, Darth Vader (with new torso), Jedi Knight Luke, Princess Leia, Han, Han in Stormtrooper gear, Luke, Luke in Stormtrooper gear, Obi-Wan, Chewie, two new Death Star troopers, new Dianoga fig, and the list goes on!

If you are wondering if the $400 price tag is worth it, I would definitely recommend ordering this set.  You won't regret it.

Pros:

Over 20 minifigs
Over 16 different rooms
Huge!
Tons of playability
Tons of features and details

Cons:

I've noticed since I've started to collect them recently, that sometimes the helmets or hair of some minifigs don't fit well on their respective heads.  The Darth Vader helmet in this set and a couple others I have are really loose and tend to easily fall off.  It's pretty annoying.  I don't remember if this was a problem back in the day, but I've really noticed this lately and it tends to bug me.

"hustla187","2009-02-25T20:30:12.95Z","This Set is a Legend Already","Lego made a wise decision making a minifig scale Death Star. The interior is very accurate to the Star Wars films as seen in A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. The Death Star laser cannon is very cool and is one of the coolest parts of the set. There are a massive amount of minifigs in this set from the Death Star troopers to the variations of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. The only flaw is that the price is expensive and C3PO's hands should be gold. Besides that, this set is already a legend and I expect this set to be around for a while.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It is also one of those sets that you dream about Lego creating, despite the fact that you doubt it will ever happen. Somehow, though, it&#39;s most definitely&nbsp;happened.</p>

<p>The first floor of this massive sphere contains a couple of canisters and a part of the chasm. The second floor has much more. It includes the trash compactor, whose walls actually close in, a large rotating gun that shoots a missile, a loading facility with crane and pilot lift, the tractor beam which can be &quot;deactivated&quot; by pulling out a control stick, and the top portion of the chasm that Luke and Leia can swing across. Onto the third floor. It includes the Death Star super laser, which can swivel side to side as well as tilt up and down, the hangar bay with a moving launch rack for a miniature TIE Fighter, the Emperor&#39;s throne room, which has a collapsible platform and a bridge, and lastly the detention block which has a Leia&#39;s cell, a ceiling mounted gun, and my personal favorite detail- the chute that leads into the trash compactor.The fourth floor is not lacking in detail either. It contains the imperial conference room which is decorated with a round table that holds a stash of weapons under it, two large guns that rotate simultaneously, the room that controls the movement of the super laser, and the droid maintenance facility which has a workbench and the knob which controls the central elevator. The elevator runs through the entire center of the Death Star and makes many of the rooms accessible.</p>

<p>I will admit that this set is overpriced, but there is simply too much offered here to bump the rating down. Did I mention the minifigures? This set contains an absolute plethora of &nbsp;minifigures, more than any other Star Wars set. Several characters are redesigned, the best of which is Darth Sidious, who is now even more grotesque than before. If you are addicted to Star Wars, buy this set!! And if you&#39;re not addicted, this will get you addicted!</p>

"DrDaveWatford","2009-01-17T04:57:40.763Z","Magnificent !","I was in heaven while building this. The team who designed this set were clearly Star Wars fans, and they included so many little touches and references to the movies that Star Wars fans can't fail to love it. Be it Luke and Leia's swing across the chasm, Ben Kenobi deactivating the tractor beam, the gunfight in the prison block or the battle with the dianoga in the garbage compactor, many of the locations are faithfully recreated. When you also consider the large number of minifigs included, there's enormous play value in the set.

Technically I was also highly impressed - many moving parts, 2 working lifts and some extremely clever construction techniques show how much thought has gone into the design. It was a really fun build overall due to the sheer variety of different areas included in the set. Took me about 3 days to finish on and off, and whenever I was taking a break I couldn't wait to get back to it....

If you love Star Wars, love LEGO and have the cash this is a total no-brainer. More lets like this please, LEGO.

All of the outstanding comments made by folks before us have been accurate.  It's a pricey set but definitely worth every penny.  Our only con has been the tractor beam.  Perhaps we're doing something wrong but ours is extremely touchy and falls apart every time we try to attach it, let alone play with it.  Has anyone come up with a modification that makes it more stable or do you think we might be doing something wrong?

"Lumix","2009-12-25T13:03:15.077Z","May the bricks be with you! One of the BESTS SETS ever!","I have made a complete, very detailed review here:
http://www.hispalug.com/foro/index.php?topic=7695.0

The review includes many photos both of the building process and the complete model, animated GIFs to show playability and also two videos.

This huge sets is a playable version of the feared, destructive Death Star. It represents the most iconic scenes both of Death Star I and Death Star II, as seen in Episodes IV and VI, respectively.

The building process is very lengthy. There are many many pieces, almost 4000, which come in unnumered bags, so it's advisable to sort them a bit before starting to build the set. Besides, there are mainly black, dark grey and lightbluish grey, and sometimes it can be hard to tell which is the correct colour to use in some steps, because there are many identical pieces in both black and dark grey, and the HUGE instruction booklet doesn't help you a lot in that regard. There are some printed pieces (specially consoles) but there are also many stickers to be applied. The building itself is very lenghty and very ""SYSTEM""-like, starting from the bottom of the Death Star and building each level upwards, adding the elements for each room. You can see some detailed photos of the building process here:
http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=394105

The finished model is HUGE, very tall (as tall as the UCS 10174 AT-ST) and  extremely detailed. Of course, it's uncovered, unlike 10143 - Death Star II, because it's mainly a playset, although its rounded shape and its superlaser make this ""uncovered"" Death Star perfectly recogniceable. Front side view:

Back side view:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050246.jpg

There's a lot ot attention paid to small detail. Every room represented in the set resembles the original closely. The bottom floor is the smallest one, almost empty except for some canisters.

The first floor has 5 rooms:
- Trash compactor, with some pieces to make debris and also a dianoga monster. The walls can approach to crush the garbage, like in the movie, and the bottom door can be opened:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050440.jpg
- Tractor beam's room, with Obi-Wan deactivating it:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050445.jpg
- Abyss, where Luke and Leia perform the ""leap of faith"":
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050454.jpg
- Maintenance room, which includes a small cart that you can place anywhere, and a maintenance vehicle. There's also a moveable elevator that leads to the hangar, above this room:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050464.jpg
- Laser cannon room, which has a turbolaser battery, as seen in the movie. This turbolaser can rotate and elevate, and has a flick-missile:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050458.jpg

The second (middle) floor has 4 rooms:
- Detention block AA-23, where Leia is held captive. It also includes an interrogation droid. You can open Leia's cell door, move the lights in the ceiling, remove the side fence to access the cell, and open the hole that leads to the trash compactor below. 
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050530.jpg
The hexagonal corridor is very well-designed:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050533.jpg
- Emperor's Throne room, where Palpatine sits in his turnable chair, in front of the great glass window. There is a moveable platform (a platform is destroyed during Vader and Luke duel), and a hole in the floor that leads to the abyss below, so that you can recreate Palpatine's destruction scene.
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050503.jpg
- Hangar, where the TIE Advanced x1 is stored. A minifig can fit inside the TIE. Also, its stand can turn. The glass window in Palpatine's room serves also as a ""window"" for the hangar. An elevator connects the hangar with the maintenance room below. 
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050482.jpg
- SuperLaser control room, where the superlaser dish is anchored. There are 8 firing tributary beams and a central beam. The Superlaser dish can turn a bit, and elevate a bit, operating on a console in the third level. There's a small, open room with windows overlooking the hangar.
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050471.jpg

The third (top) floor also has 4 rooms:
- Control room. There are two consoles here, one of them can rotate to turn the superlaser below. There is also a romboidal ""screen"" that shows either an image of Alderaan or a ""computer image"" of Yavin's moon behind Yavin, as seen in Episode IV's final battle.
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050543.jpg
- Meeting room, where the officers discuss about plans. There are seven chairs and a desk, whose top part can be removed to store things inside, a nice touch.
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050546.jpg
- Turbolaser ""room"". There are two heavy-duty turbolasers here. Both can turn at the same time by turning a stick just below the third floor ground. Each turret can elevate its twin turbolasers by turning a cog in their right side.
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050551.jpg
- Droid maintenance room. There is a operating table here that can be lifted up to turn the cog that turns the TIE Advanced stand. THere are two spare stormtrooper helmets, several maintenance tools and a small hole on the wall to allow the mouse droid to pass between rooms (a nice touch). On the wall there is a rod that raises or lowers the elevator.
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10188/p1050541.jpg

There is an elevator that goes through the central part of the Death Star from top to bottom, which stops on each floor.

I've made several animated images (GIFs) that show all the playability this set has. You can see these GIFs in this gallery (each GIF may take a bit to load completely):
http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=394094

10188 includes no less than 25 minifigs, an awesome number! It makes the set more playable and adds a lot to it. There are several lightsabers, two cufflinks, several spare blasters and an extremely cool blue rays pieces to create the feared Emperor's force lightning. You can see all the minifigs (except for the mouse droid, not shown) here:

PROS
- Tons of playability.
- Iconic model.
- 25 minifigs, this is the set that includes most minifigs of all.
- Very detailed.
- Very big.

CONS
- In my country it is ridiculously expensive, 499€... beware, it's €€, not $$, so it would be more than 600$, so that you can make yourself an idea. Many thumbs down for Lego on this.
- Could use more imperial officers.
- Don't try to swoosh it around LOL.

I recommend this set wholeheartedly. There are so many things in this set that are so amazing... It's a must-have for any serious Lego Star Wars collector out there, with lots of minifigs, very playable, an incredible detail and it recreates many of the most famous scenes inside the Death Star both from Episode IV and VI. It's amazing how some rooms are related to others. Full photo gallery here:

There are about a dozen rooms, and each one is FILLED with movie references and possible scene reenactments. All the minifigs make these scenes possible and add to the sets value. If you can think up a death star scene from a star wars movie, you can reenact it fully with this set!

I got it as a Christmas Present, and as I saw it, I was amazed, The Box was massive, and when I opened it I was....well.....shocked. The Instruction ""Booklet"" was a massive ring binder, with over 100 pages!
I started building it later after Christmas Dinner. It took a week, and a total time of about 15hours to fully complete, and the result was impressive...

Pros: 

Lots of Great Minifigs 
Loads of Rooms from different parts of the Death Star, even The                 
Emperor's Room from the Death Star II 
A Small Tie Advanced, that Darth Vader (or a tie Fighter Pilot) can sit in.
Lots of Playable Features.
Quite Sturdy, and can be lifted, and moved without it Falling apart, although
to do this, you need to hold the Middle layer, at the to ""Rhombus-Shaped"" 
Joints. It is Quite heavy though, so don't injure yourself.

Cons: 

The Price: It was worth £350 when I got it, and I don't think it is worth that
much. Luckily Now Its price is almost £100 cheaper. It's still expensive, but £260 is more worth it.
Darth Vader doesn't fit into the Tie Advanced very well, but its not too bad a problem.

Most of the turning mechanisms uses technic friction pin so its not easy to operate the lifts quickly.
The minifigure accessories have nowhere to store except dumping them in the tray on the top droid repair room.

The Black & Dark-Bley in instructions problem wasn't as bad as I thought.
I only made around 4 mistake with it. That was when I couldn't find a piece in black so I turned the DS around to find the same piece in dark-bley and doublecheck it's colour in the instruction booklet.
Sometimes I would count the pieces used to confirm that my set isn't missing any part.

    <li>It's a pretty strudy build (for the most part).</li>
    <li>25 mini-figures including Grand Moff Tarkin, Death Star Troopers, R2-Q5, and a Death Star Protocol Droid!</li>
    <li>So much playability with this - so many rooms and adventures await!</li>
    <li>Lots of moving parts/equipment for added fun.</li>
    <li>The details in the rooms are excellent - virtually every scene from the Death Star on ANH and ROTJ can be re-created!</li>
    <li>Mini TIE-Advanced which a mini-fig can fit in.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Cons:</u></p>
<ul>
    <li>Tractor Beam platform is very delicate and breaks apart very easily.</li>
    <li>Hard to &quot;snap&quot; mini-figs onto the elevator floor.</li>
    <li>Some stickers.</li>
    <li>Wish more Stormtroopers and/or Death Star Troopers were included.</li>
    <li>Wish Death Star Gunners and/or Imperical Officer mini-figs were included.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>Details</b></u></p>
<p>There are technically 17 rooms when finished (4 on each level), although it's very hard to get to 3 out of the 4 on the bottom level (what I call the basement) because they aren't very tall, so I'll count 13 rooms in all.&nbsp; Here are the rooms:</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Basement Space:</i> The only basement level room you can have easy access to, just a wide open space with access to the elevator.&nbsp; The black curved railing ends to pop off easily.</li>
    <li><i>That Space Where Luke/Leia Swing:</i> Platforms and rope for people to swing across (the controls that extend the bridge are blasted still).&nbsp; Grey ring that completes the exterior circle frame pops off easily.&nbsp; </li>
    <li><i>Trash Compactor:</i> A Dianoga!&nbsp; Plus &quot;trash&quot; pieces and walls that can close.&nbsp; Elevator has access to this level.&nbsp; Hatch can open and close to trap mini-figs inside!</li>
    <li><i>Tracor Beam Control:</i> The platform is a bit flimsy, I had to reinforce it with a lot of plates on top and the bottom before I could easily get mini-figs to snap onto the floor without it breaking apart.&nbsp; Neat feature where you can turn off the beam and transuscent blue LEGOs disappear (fall inside the unit)!</li>
    <li><i>Loading Station:</i> Forklift can load barrels onto a platform that will raise to the TIE Fighter Hangar.&nbsp; My AT-AT driver operates this when not on AT-AT duty.&nbsp; Access to elevator.</li>
    <li><i>Gun Platform:</i> What the Death Star Gunners operate in ANH in the Battle of Yavin.&nbsp; It rotates and shoots out a missile (similar to the Rouge Shadow's missile).&nbsp; Blaster rack in the wall.&nbsp; My Shadow Troopers operate this (they are close enough to the DSGs for me!).&nbsp; I added some 1x1 circle translucents to the ends of the guns.</li>
    <li><i>Detention Block:</i> Doors open to allow an escape to the garbage chute (which leads directly into the trash compactor below) and also other doors to allow you to look into the detention cell.&nbsp; Cameras in the walls/ceilings are a nice touch.&nbsp; I have Juno Eclipse manning the computer desk.&nbsp; My daughter stuffs the cell full with all the bad guys :)</li>
    <li><i>Death Star Laser:</i> The Big Gun is here and has the ability to be rotated and raised/lowered from the room above it.&nbsp; There is also a platform with window that overlooks the TIE FIghter Hangar and a wheel to open/close a blast door.</li>
    <li><i>Emperor's Throne Room:</i> Has holes in the floor with rails to simulate how Palpatine meets his end, there is also a platform that can swing down a la when Vader chucks his saber in the rafters when Luke hops up there in ROTJ.&nbsp; The throne itself and steps to get there are very cool.&nbsp; Elevator has access.</li>
    <li><i>TIE Fighter Hangar:</i> TIE Advanced is stored here and the elevator/platform from the Loading Station room ends up here as well.&nbsp; It's a little hard to fit figures with helmets into the TIE, but put them in without their helmets first, then put the helmet on.&nbsp; Elevator has access.</li>
    <li><i>Conference Room:</i> 7 spinning chairs around&nbsp; a table that can easily be lifted off to hide things inside.&nbsp; Elevator has access.</li>
    <li><i>Death Star Laser Control:</i> Device to rotate the super laser dish is here, as is a viewscreen on the wall that can show Alderaan and the moon with the Rebel Base by Yavin.</li>
    <li><i>Droid Maintence:</i> Table and chair and a sort of &quot;sick bay&quot; for droids.&nbsp; Wheel here under the sickbay bed allows you to rotate the apparatus that holds the TIE Advanced on the floor beneath it.&nbsp; Elevator has access. </li>
    <li><i>Surface Lasers:</i> Two twin laster cannons that rotate in unison thanks to pieces on the ceiling of the floor beneath it.&nbsp; Cannons can rotate up and down with the crank of the wheel on the side (I modified the build so that the wheels were not both on the same side of the cannon box (each one has it's wheel next to the room's wall) which makes it easier for me to move the wheels.&nbsp; </li>
    <li><i>Elevator:</i> Reaches some rooms on all 4 floors of the model.&nbsp; Hard to get figures to snap onto the floor, but not sure how to correct that.&nbsp; Nice touch and brings back memories of the Death Star playset I had back in the late seventies!</li>

"Bside","2013-01-07T22:48:10.57Z","Finally.","<p>Finally. This was the set that got me back into Lego a few years back (I have a feeling this was late 2009 but I am not sure). After years of ignoring/forgetting awesomeness of Lego, I chanced upon Lego.com, on which I saw this set. Mind you, I was no Star Wars fan (I did watched all 6 movies but not a fan) but this set gave me that awe that I hadn't felt for years. That laser beam (no offense to Star Wars fan but I don't know what's the official name) just amused me, and I started collecting Lego sets again.</p><p>I did not buy this set until a month ago, as it never seemed to be leaving the S@H and thus no rush in getting it. However, as I did not buy any Lego sets this year (I usually only buy bigger sets, and I don't like either the town hall or B-wing. I'm sure I will be getting town hall someday though, just to complete Modular house street), I decided to pick up this huge set during the double VIP month. (and finally!)</p><p>Well, there are so many reviews out there, I assumed that by the time you read my review you probably know whether you want or you don't want this set and so I wouldn't go into details. This set is huge, sets are subdivided into four boxes. The instructions are bound together and is about 200 pages long, biggest/thickest pile of instructions I had ever seen. Its not a bad thing but it gets in the way when you are building the set and I have no idea how to store it. There are stickers, unfortunately, and mine was crumpled by the time I got to them in the boxes.&nbsp;</p><p>I spend about 7 nights (2 hours each session) to build this set. There are lots of functions, lots of minifigs, it is overall very sturdy except for one of the connectors structure-like-thingy at the bottom of the set. There are&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;some cool building techniques but there weren't too many and it was overall a relatively easy build (it has a rating of 14+).</p><p>This set is huge. I did not expect such a huge set (spoiler: It is even bigger than R2-D2 10225). The TIE that comes with the set is relatively big too (definitely&nbsp;bigger than those in polybags). It is gonna be hard to find a place to display/store this set, and if a layer of dust settle on it, you gonna have a hard time cleaning it.</p><p>Final Verdict? On one hand, it has a lot of minifigs and lots of cool features, I guess it is a must have for star wars/huge sets fans. I read that you can recreate all the actions from Episode IV V and VI that were on Deathstar (i think so too). &nbsp;On the other hand, it still cost $400. It took me 3 years before I decided to buy it.&nbsp;</p><p>But I probably will not regret my choice. After all, the laser beam still looks damn awesome.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

<ul><li>Pro 1: Let's start with the mini figures. Wow! There are a bunch with this set, and with the exception of a few they are all new to my collection. Listing them all would make this review too long, but suffice to say you get pretty much every figure you need to recreate the scenes from the ANH and ROTJ. Even the droids are well done. Top marks here.</li><li>Pro 2: In my reviews I mention how close to the movies the sets are, and with this one you can tell the designer(s) watched the movies closely. There are so many small details that make you say ""oh yeah I remember that."" This set has so many great features, and it is designed well. You can actually let our heroes fall through the grate into the trash compactor. There is a catwalk in the Emperor's throne room from which Luke can fall. Security cameras, closing blast doors, elevators, cannons, I could go on and on but you get the idea: LOTS of detail.</li><li>Pro 3: The build was a lot of fun. For the price of this set I wanted to spend a lot of time building it and I did. It took quite a while. There were few X2 and X3 spots and even the sticker sheet was minimal for a set this size (I don't mind stickers, but I know a number of Lego fans don't care for them).&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 4: The playability with this set is amazing. With the Star Destroyers you can't do much but look at them. The Death Star is meant to be played with. My wife jokingly calls it my ""Star Wars dollhouse.""&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 5: There are a lot of cool and different pieces, plus a lot of standard ones. You even get quite a few colors besides greys and blacks, which livens up the set.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The only con I can think of, and I had to do some thinking to get even this one, is it would be cool for the set to have a small ""trench"" and the ""thermal exhaust port"". I guess they could have put that where the droid repair bay is.</li></ul>
<p>This is an amazing set. Throughout the build I kept saying to myself, ""wow, they even thought of this!"" I could spend an hour listing all the small details in this set, but it's more fun to let you builders find them yourself. This set is expensive, but I think its well worth it, which is why I gave it 5 bricks in the value category. Lego did an excellent job with the Death Star, a truly fantastic creation and a ""must-have"" for any SW Lego fan.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"arl100","2012-07-30T11:52:08.28Z","A massive set, even in miniature","<p>First of all, a fantastic set! You certainly are getting your money's worth when you buy this, as there is a lot of detail and minifigures that you can tell this is far better than the Death Star 2 they did many years ago (you actually get figures for a start). Moving on to the pros and cons</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>20 odd minifigures, both from New Hope and Jedi so you can create scenes from both Death Stars</li><li>Mini TIE Advanced for Vader is a nice touch and welcome addition to the set.</li><li>Rare Dianoga figure</li><li>So many different rooms, you aren't likely to get bored</li><li>Excellent display piece</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>More stormtroopers</li><li>One or two Imperial Officers would be good</li><li>Quite difficult for Vader to actually fit IN the Fighter.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall a brilliant set, LEGO have surpassed themselves with the detail and the range of figures from the episodes. This set can easily have a couple of additions, such as mini TIE Fighters or more Stormtroopers and the addition of Officers. Although quite a high price to outlay, it is certainly excellent value for money and would encourage those considering buying it to go ahead and do so. You won't regret it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

Took a week to build what with life and work getting in the way but what a pleasure to see the&nbsp;death star come together. The floor panels are the only aspect you could say is repetitive but each corner is slightly varied. &nbsp;The trash compactor was probably the best to build on the first level but it is just an entree to the main event which is the detention level. The sticker to give the impression&nbsp;of the corridor&nbsp;is superb and the detail in each section is a thing of lego genius. previously my favourite build was 7965 the falcon but this is by far a better experience. once completed i wanted to start again and maybe try and do it on a clear weekend,probably start friday evening and have it done by sunday.</p>

Regarding inaccuracy, some reviews state that the first and second death star rooms are intermixed into this one set and is somewhat bothersome to people.

I build most sets under 500 pieces as a &quot;puzzle build&quot;, without using the instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Initial impressions:</strong> This set is massive and incredibly expensive.&nbsp; It is also the set that all future sets I build will be compared to.&nbsp; I found a used set locally, and I was lucky that it was still assembled so I was confident in it&#39;s completeness.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience:</strong> At nearly 4 thousand pieces, I followed the directions from the beginning.&nbsp; This set is an undertaking, I spent nearly 2 hours sorting bricks before I even started (Since it was used, I didn&#39;t have the luxury of numbered boxes and bags.)&nbsp; I enjoyed the build immensely, the only part of the construction which dragged on for me was the repetitive floor and wall construction.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Finished Model:</strong> I absolutely love how the finished model captures most of the scenes in the original movie so beautifully.&nbsp; The #1 highlight for me is the trash compactor room and the cleverly designed hallway above it complete with a trap door!&nbsp; I also loved the miniature ship and hanging support.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This is my favorite Lego set ever. In a 10-point scale, I&#39;d give it a 9/10, only because I want to reserve the perfect ten for a future set that matches this on scale and storytelling, but includes more advanced and varied construction.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The sheer amount of minifigures in this set greatly increase the amount of playability but some minifigures are unnecessary such as the many Luke Skywalkers.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks good if you have all the minifigures doing something otherwise it looks deserted and bland and doesn&#39;t look very good on display.The circular shape of the frame is as accurate as lego can get. The only downside to the model is the size, unless you have a massive shelf or desk you won&#39;t have space for it and it will have to sit on the floor and possibly be kicked by someone.</p>

"TimTam22","2017-11-20T10:47:02.3Z","Death Star - amazing set, but little special pieces","<p>I got this set from my parents on Christmas a few years back, and I was so excited that I ran several laps of the house. Every since I saw that this set existed in a big LEGO encyclopedia that I have, I wanted it. I wasn&#39;t allowed to build the whole lot, as my dad and brother also wanted to build, but what I did build was awesome. You can easily re-create scenes from the fourth and sixth movies, such as throwing some minifigs&nbsp;into the trash compactor via the detention block, and then promptly crushing them with the trash compactor. (sadly, even when you remove all debris from the compactor, it cannot close all the way.)</p>

<p>The system that makes the two turrets move in synchronization was fairly nifty. Whilst I don&#39;t usually appreciate stickers or printed bricks, the image at the back of the detention block gives it a very cool effect of being an extremely long corridor. The mini TIE fighter is a very nice addition to the set, whilst it may look a bit clunky, it is actually quite spacious inside, considering its size.</p>

<p>All sets have problems, and it stands to reason that a big set would have many problems. The big problems with the Death Star, in my opinion, are these:</p>

<p>The massive laser cannon may look very awesome, but has little mobility, and it quite flimsy. Because of its size and elevation, it smashes to bits when it falls off. The building was also a little tedious at the start - I built nothing exciting until the second floor, the only thing that kept me going was anticipation towards the next floors. There is a massive elevator that reaches all the way from the top floor to the bottom, which is fairly useless as it is almost impossible to reach an average-sized hand into the corner of the rooms, let alone manage to stick the minifig to the floor of the elevator. The rope for the elevator is unnecessarily long, and ends up getting in knots which are stupidly hard to undo. Finally, there is not much variety in the pieces. If you want to use this set as a source of bricks for your own creation, think again. Almost every brick is grey, and most are either slopes or standard bricks. Unless you want to build a&nbsp;statue model, this set will not make a good source of bricks.</p>

<p>So, whilst this set is brilliant for playability and fun to build, it is a little annoying for it&#39;s flimsy and hard-to reach areas. Also, it lacks a source of interesting bricks. I am certainly glad that I got this set, it is still very awesome despite the occasional flaw.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-10-10T07:06:34.313Z","The Ultimate Playset, but Not the Ultimate Lego Set.","<p>Who doesn&#39;t want to have a Death Star in their Lego collection? Of course the problem is that it is just so incredibly expensive, and rightly so given its immense size. But in reading comparisons between this Death Star and the one that is constantly sold out at the moment that costs $100 more, it appears that not a whole lot has changed, and certainly not enough to justify paying the big bucks to score the new set. However, I&#39;m guessing because the new set is an improvement, you can now get this older set for a considerable discount on the second hand market. It took a long time and many failed attempts at landing this set, but in the end I managed to get this set on eBay for $275 with tax and shipping, and aside from a few missing bricks (all which I can get on Bricklink for well under $1), it is perfect and in great shape. The only thing I didn&#39;t get was the box, but I can live with that given the price I paid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is my first experience building a UCS model, not counting the tiny <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10026-1/Special-Edition-Naboo-Starfighter"">10026</a> Naboo Starfighter. While I&#39;ve actually acquired a handful of incredibly large sets over the last year, this one is the easily the largest, well eclipsing my NES set that I purchased barely a month&nbsp;ago. As a result I really didn&#39;t know what to expect with this set aside from the fact that I would need to dig through nearly 4000 bricks to find the ones I needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Instructions&nbsp;</p>

<p>So this was an incredible shock to me. I was expecting several books as is usually the case with large sets, however for this set you get a single book that is spiral bound and printed on very heavy 11x17 paper, meaning when you open it you need an area a yard wide just for the instructions! The book contains 200 pages and no fluff. I&#39;m used to these sets containing a several page introduction, but not here, you open it up and straight to step 1. As soon as you complete the model you get the inventory pages and it&#39;s over. While I would have liked the usual intro, I can forgive Lego because the massive size of these instructions would indeed make it difficult to read. What I do like is that each step has a considerable amount of pieces, if I had to guess I&#39;d say it averages a little over 10 bricks per step.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Well you sure do get a lot of them, and for the most part they are very large bricks and plates. This is not a set that gives you a ton of 1x1 studs to inflate the brick count, yes, you do get a lot of small parts, but that&#39;s because you get a lot of parts! I&#39;m not sure that any particular part is all that special or hard to find, aside from the ones you apply stickers to, but you do get an interesting collection of parts. My favorite thing is that you get a black hose that dates back to sets from the 80&#39;s (think Classic Space) as well as several light gray antennas from the same era. These are parts that I have not seen outside of the sets from my childhood so I was pretty excited to see them in a Star Wars set. While there are a good sized collection of technic parts, I&#39;d say percentage-wise it is relatively small for a Star Wars set. That said, every technic part is for a play feature, they are not used for structure at all.</p>

<p>The Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since I got this set used and it was disassembled and placed in quite a few ziplock bags that broke and opened up during shipping, the most time consuming&nbsp;part of the build was of course sorting all of the bricks and finding the ones I needed. Then I had to&nbsp;find&nbsp;room to build this set, I needed a place for the instructions, model, and the 20 ziplock bags that I organized the loose bricks into. The trickiest part was being able to keep the instructions close enough so that I could see them. Well let&#39;s just say I took my time in building this which stretched out over several weeks and 9 evenings. Overall, including time spent sorting bricks as well as setting up and cleaning up at the beginning and end of each session, it took me 19 hours and 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Just so you know, this build isn&#39;t rocket science, or even space station science, it is pretty much just simple stacking with a limited amount of technic for play features and very little SNOT. While this is a little disappointing, it is not surprising given that it is really just floors and walls, and it is still an &nbsp;enjoyable build. Yes, you can argue it is only building floors and walls, but each one is different so while similar, you do go back and forth a lot, so it never feels repetitive. It also helped that I broke it out into so many sessions so I never repeated similar builds in the same night.</p>

<p>No particular part of the build stands out as exciting or creative, although watching this model grow to such an immense size is probably the best part about it. Of course it is also nice when you build out the components of different rooms as it changes up the build dramatically, whether it is a cannon, or Vader&#39;s TIE, or even the very simple trash compactor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Play Features&nbsp;</p>

<p>I said this is the ultimate play set, and much of that is thanks to the large number of rooms, openness, and quantity of minifigures which allow you to play out pretty much any scene that took place on the Death Star (except for trench runs). However there are also a large number of play features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite feature is the two part feature of the detention level with a grate that opens and empties into the trash compactor. The trash compactor can then start closing although the long metal pipe thing doesn&#39;t bend. The door in the trash compactor also opens (into the elevator).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another fun one is turning off the tractor beams which is on an elevated platform. I really enjoy how the blue power thing hides inside and being a Classic Space fan, really like the levers are antennas. The way you reset this feature is also well designed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You do have one cannon on the bottom level that can be aimed and fires a large missile like you have in the new action battle sets. On the top floor you have two more cannons that don&#39;t fire, yet swivel in unison which is a very cool effect for when you fly an X-Wing past them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main planet destroying weapon can be aimed both horizontally and vertically using stacked spinning mechanisms that are integrated quite nicely into controls directly above it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have Vader&#39;s TIE that is hangs and can be swiveled, and while very small, it can hold Vader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also have a closing blast door between where the Falcon is and where Vader and Obiwan duel, although it simply slides closed in a single direction, although you really can&#39;t expect any more given the fact you don&#39;t have room for it to&nbsp;move from both sides, and certainly not diagonally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the emperor&#39;s throne room you do have a platform that can fall, although it doesn&#39;t work great. More importantly, you have a pit to throw him into.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bridge scene is well represented, although the doors don&#39;t close. All you have is a rope hanging from the ceiling that allows Luke and Leia to swing across.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally you have two elevators, one that pulls you up to the room where the TIE is located, but should really be the room where the Falcon is located. There is also a large elevator running through the central core of the model with openings (not doors) on each floor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Model</p>

<p>The model itself looks great. Obviously this set does not represent the exterior of the Death Star, but it&#39;s spherical shape is more than sufficient. Perhaps the best visual effect I&#39;ve ever seen in a Lego set is in the detention cell where the long and seemingly endless hallway is well designed with a series of walls with progressively smaller openings, a narrowing walkway, and a sticker in the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly is that this massive set, completely devoid of technic to reinforce the structure, is actually incredibly strong and can easily be moved. While it is too heavy to fly across the galaxy, it can be moved easily enough to facilitate play or place on a table.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>I certainly would have loved a more complex build, it is disappointing that in a set of this size you don&#39;t actually see any revolutionary techniques. My only other complaint is the inclusion of the TIE. I&#39;m not upset to have it, but I feel a miniature Falcon would have been more appropriate as it is physically present on the Death Star in the movie, the TIE is only a participant in the trench run which isn&#39;t included in this set. Anyways, it is easy enough to add a Falcon microfighter to this set to make up for the omission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it is all said and done, this set gives you everything you need to reenact all the scenes from the movies on both Death Stars. The minifigure selection is fantastic, no one has been forgotten. This is simply a set that is a ton of fun to build and a ton of fun to play with. The fact that you can get it at a considerable discount over its original price makes it very well worth it, even though it still is expensive. I do highly recommend this set to any Star Wars fan as you will no doubt absolutely love it.&nbsp;</p>

"Chemistry2101","2019-12-21T19:26:49.807Z","Amazing Playset Unrivalled In Its Day","<p>As a child this set was the set of my dreams; the ultimate playset. At the time it seemed to me like LEGO would never get better than this. And maybe that&#39;s what this set is, a child&#39;s playset, rather than an adults display piece.&nbsp;Well we&#39;ll see I guess, once I&#39;ve carefully considered the major aspects of the set.</p>

<p>The Build:</p>

<p>At the time, back when I was about 8 years old, the build took up a whole weekend with me building on and off. It was unlike anything I&#39;d ever experienced before at the time, and even having rebuilt it a few times since I can still say that the last time I built it I had fun.&nbsp;The structure of the set lends itself well to the build process, you build floor panels, walls and detailing in small sections, and constantly vary between them so it never gets boring to build.</p>

<p>The Parts:</p>

<p>All the parts are fairly standard pieces today and are nearly all used in much cheaper and more readily available sets, however that being said there is a great range and variety of pieces used in the detailing on the set, even if the walls and floors are made of some very generic LBG pieces. The string for the lift is an interesting inclusion, but I&#39;ll get to that when I consider the model as a whole.</p>

<p>The Minifigs:</p>

<p>At the time these had to be the main selling point of this set; I mean what kid wouldn&#39;t want 24 fantastic minifigures and a massive playset to play with I guess. To me these figures set the standard for what was a &quot;classic&quot; design; to me the figures of this era of LEGO Star Wars look the cleanest, with fantastic designs but not having been overdesigned like some of the modern figures. I really like the Imperial Officers and Stormtroopers of the time, as I just think they sum up what LEGO should be and how far LEGO should go in its designs. To be honest I don&#39;t buy a lot of regular sets these days, I mainly stick to UCS, but if I did it would annoy be me no end that the designs keep changing with every wave of sets as it means there is no continuity between figures; your Stormtrooper &quot;army&quot;&nbsp;begins to&nbsp;look quite ragtag. Shortly put, I like the design of the figures in this set and their number.</p>

<p>The Completed Set:</p>

<p>The finished thing is a magnificent playset, and to be honest LEGO doesn&#39;t really get better when it comes to massive playsets; even now I think this is a better play set than the Ewok Village or Assault on Hoth and is probably up there with Betrayal at Cloud City (which I do not own). However that is all this set really is, it isn&#39;t a display piece and if you want a displayable Death Star I&#39;d say buy 2005&#39;s UCS Death Star II. It just looks a bit of mess to be honest alongside all my other UCS sets on my shelves, and from a collector and displayer&#39;s point of view it is definitely my least favourite, even the Ewok Village looks a lot more coherent. In terms of specific design points I dislike the string used for the lift as it doesn&#39;t provide a tight fit and the lift wobbles considerably; I think perhaps a purely technic mechanism may have been better suited.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>If you want a massive play set then maybe this is for you. I would say it measures up extremely similarly next to its 2016 re-release&nbsp;so if you can get this at a much cheaper price than the newer version I would say it might be worth it. However I think that that&#39;s unlikely so would probably have to recommend the newer version if only because it&#39;s likely to be cheaper to get MISB. From a collector&#39;s perspective it&#39;s not the best, and there are at least 20 more displayable UCS sets out there I&#39;d recommend buying first if you want a display collection. Overall it&#39;s unlikely anyone except the die hard collectors would buy this these days as there are better options out there whatever you want to buy. That said this is still an amazing set and I don&#39;t think anyone would be disappointed if they did buy it.</p>
