Since this year, dwarves and trolls begun to be released with the theme. This keychain is just one piece (to not dismantle), and is a dwarf, common in the theme.

The quality and details of the minifigure are good, but the details make a desnecessary effect. A dwarf don't needs a &quot;giant&quot; beard (with the size of the body), helmet like this (with wings or not, but it is so much similar to the helmet used by the dwarf Gimli, character from the Lord of the rings movie), and don't needs an axe (well, this don't includes, but several Lego dwarves have axes, in many sets). This looks like more a fake Gimli (or the Gimli's minifigure in Lego shape, but without the Gimli's name).

But the details still good, and also the quality, it still good, but somethings are unnecessary. Also, as a keychain, this set is really cheap (US$3.99 is a decent price for a keychain), and it is very good for who likes the Castle (2007-currently) theme. But needs more original ideas. And also, a set or even a small battle pack (well, there aren't any dwarves battle packs released) can be more useful than this keychain. A 2,9 of 5. Needed more original ideas and could be more useful.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
