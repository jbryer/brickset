"lego12","2008-05-08T18:34:35.653Z"," This set is AWESOME!"," I guess Fighter95 said everything we need to know but just to tell you, you should 100% buy him! He is SUPER tall and as Fighter95 mentioned he does wobble a lot unfortunatly... :( He is amazing...it looks really really COOL when you put him somewhere where everybody can see him and then everybody goes and looks at it(I tried it :) It is the best! I had to put it back on my desk in my room unfortunatly, so nobody would touch it (I 100% DISLIKE it when people touch my legos, it gets me REALLY MAD!) It looks AMAZING! Thanks for reading my review and I hope you enjoyed it!

The lightsabers are cool and perfectly made. The head looks really good and is accurate for Lego bricks. The chest can open to reveal organs which is cool, but it make me think Lego should make a UCS version of Obi-Wan after watching Revenge of the Sith a while ago. Overall, this is very good for a UCS set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T13:32:32.403Z","Taller than I thought!","First, let me say that this is a very tall and very detailed set. This comes with plenty of great pieces for you to enjoy. Your vaalue with your money on this is great. You definetley should consider this as a gift for someone or for yourself because this is a fun activity to build and is amazing when you finish building it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"shinjix2","2009-03-17T10:37:01.513Z","The Finger Killer","Got this set for christmas. I put it together the next day and It took me roughly 3 hours (with distractions) Afterwards, my finger ached. Mainly do to the fact that the pieces were all small. It was a challenge and thats what I enjoyed the most.

Pros:
Size
The different configurations you can set it at (2 or 4 arms)
Heavy Duty Base
Detail

Cons:
Set leans forward
Pretty fragile

"VideoGameLord613","2008-07-19T17:47:16.03Z","44 steps total","This is a very realistic set. Lego made it very accurately.
Pros:
Big
You can split apart the chest plate revealing Grievous's organs!
I like the collector's display card

Cons:
Wobbles when you touch it
Leans forward  

I'd highly recommend this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Here is the closing of that review:

Features
As mentioned above during the build, the head moves, the base rotates, his body opens to reveal his insides. It's supposed to be more of a static display then something to play with. So as it stands, it's not bad. I would've liked to see his head detailed a little more as his ""ears"" seem a little off for what it should look like, and he's missing his cape.

My rating:
Playability: 1 out of 5. It is pose able. That's it. It's a display.
Design: 4 out of 5. Well done. Just some minor things. Notably the ""ears"" and maybe his insides could've been done better.
Build experience: 3 out of 5. Easy to build. For 1000+ pieces, it was easy. I guess they rated it for ages 14+ because of the many small pieces, no numbered poly-bags and for having so many pieces.
Overall: 4 out of 5. At $89.99 I might have bought it because I think the way General Grievous is made is be-awesome, but Lego's version isn't worth that price. At $29.98 it's a must have for any Lego Star Wars fan to have.

"blaksamu12","2011-02-24T22:20:23.103Z","Epic!","<p>UCS General Greivous is amazing.&nbsp; Over 1,000 pieces, highly detailed, epic-looking, and&nbsp;not overpriced makes this set awesome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building Experience</strong>: 5/5.</p>
<p>The building experience is very fun and clever.&nbsp; You build the stand first, which is very fun but a little time consuming.&nbsp; Then you build a plate the connects to the stand and spins once connected.&nbsp; Right from there you build the feet on the plate, making it so you can't take General Greivous off his stand.&nbsp; The rest of the leg is very detailed, but is mostly made out of Technis pieces that i'm not familiar with.&nbsp; The torso is probably the most fun part of the build (or the stand, you can decide), and consists manily of bricks but some technic.&nbsp; The torso is extra clever since you basically connect all the arms and head to the torso.&nbsp; Next, you put on some armor around the legs and something that gets put around the neck.&nbsp; Then you build the head, which is an interesting and simple design, and looking as close to General Greivous' head as Lego can be.&nbsp; After that, you build the arms, which are kind of repetitive and not that interesting.&nbsp; Lastly, you painfully build the Lightsabers, then connect them to the arms and you're done (besides these extra shoulder plates used when the back arms are removed).&nbsp; The build took me a little over 3 hours, so I guess thats pretty reasonable.&nbsp; I enjoyed the build very much, but connecting the neon green and blue pieces killed my fingers, and took me 30 minutes :(.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts</strong>: 5/5.</p>
<p>A large variety of pieces in this set, a lot of regular bricks, and a lot of Technis pieces.&nbsp; A great mixture a pieces would be very pleasant for a MOCer.&nbsp; I'd say the parts were great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playabilty</strong>: 4/5.</p>
<p>For a UCS set, this has a good amount of playabilty.&nbsp; You can take off the arms and replace them with shoulder armor, and the you spin the head around.&nbsp; The hands can move, making posabilty (if thats a word) good.&nbsp; The can also spin the stand at the bottom, which is nice.&nbsp; However, compared the smaller sets, the isn't a lot of playabilty, but its a UCS set, which means its meant for display, not play (cool ryhme).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Value for Money</strong>: 5/5.</p>
<p>Excellent value for money.&nbsp; 1,000+ pieces for $90?&nbsp; That's great considering the overall height of the set (General Greivous is the height of the box, no joke), and based on the 10 cents per piece idea.&nbsp; Also, at one point, Lego sold it for $29.99, but I got it at my local Lego Store for half price, $44.99.&nbsp; For some reason, that had one lying near the register, and they said no one was purchasing it so a grabbed it and bough it myself.&nbsp; A would highly recommend you get it on ebay or something for at most $100.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>: 5/5.</p>
<p>Possibly my current favorite set (I haven't built my new UCS Imperial Shuttle yet) that I own.&nbsp; There is only one con that I can find.&nbsp; When you are done building General Greivous, you can put him in two positions:&nbsp; leaning foward, or leaning back.&nbsp; The legs can't completely hold up the weight of the upper body, so it leans forward or back.&nbsp; I suggest you lean it forward, since every time it lean it slightly back, I'm afraid its going to competely topple over.&nbsp; Overall, an EPIC set, one of the best of the Star Wars line, and probably in the Top 50 best&nbsp;for all Lego sets.&nbsp; I HIGHLY recommend you get it, it looks awesome and will be the centerpiece of you collection.</p>

The base is a nice addition, so when my son's friends stop by they can really see the details without worry. I own a few of the other Technic Star Wars based sets, but this is the one that any real fan should try and get their hands on.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,2,5
