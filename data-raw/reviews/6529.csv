"Nased","2008-08-06T12:12:59.437Z","Can I vote 6/5 ?","This is a fantastic set. When it first came out, I was really keen to get it. I was quite hesitant when the first price quoted was 150 pounds. However, I manage to get it at SGD$280 on Monday. I spent a total of 7 hours to build it slowly and I enjoyed the whole process.

This set is beyond perfect. It is definitely worth the money. You get 2 grey base plates and 32 lego figurines. The black and white tiles are not glued! They are mounted steadily and firmly onto a top grey base plate. The details of the set is fantastic and superb. I appreciate Lego's effort to ensure that the figurines of this series do not repeat themselves. Meaning, you will not get two trolls with identical head dress, weapons or clothes design. Thumbs up for that. 

I will come back with a second post to describe every single details of the figurines and chess board. I just hope that this post can be the first for this set. I simply love it so much. Lego did not disappoint me at all. The base is sturdy. No glue or stickers. Pure Lego constructions. Well designed figurines and plenty of weapons as decoration and war.

Love this set to the max. It deserve more than a perfect score. Definitely a Must Buy for Lego Castle series collector. I am a collector myself. I strongly recommend to display this set in the living room. I will be back after taking more photos of the set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"thebrickbuster","2008-08-15T07:17:59.64Z","Classic","This is the first set that I have pre-ordered through the LEGO shop and I haven't been dissapointed.
First of all the presentation of the set in the massive bound box is extravagant and when you open it out all the chess pieces are magically displayed. The theme throughout is magnificent.
These pieces are all so unique (unlike the previous sets)giving them all an individual appeal but not making it too hard to identify the pieces.
The board consists of 4 individual corner models; the castle, the jail, the mine and the troll camp. The tiles are on the top base plate and come assembled. 
The sides are built out and very ornate with two cool dragons heads depicting each others end.
The middle section of the board is cleverly built to accommodate all the pieces for storage.
These figures and elements have enhanced the castle theme giving this set great character.
This set has been very well thought out, is very strong and solid. It would be up there as one of my biggest and favourite sets; meets all and more of my pre-conceived expectations, congratulations Lego, well worth every cent.

The first thing that strikes you about this set it its size -- the box is huge!

The next becomes apparent when you open it -- there's a lot of LEGO in it! 33 minifigs and 2000+ parts including 2 48x48 baseplates and enough weapons and shields for an entire army.

It's clear that the set wasn't packaged in one of LEGO's usual factories because the parts are in polythene bags instead of the usual slightly stiff bags. Also, there are a lot extra parts in the bags, not just the odd 1x1 round plate. Not that any of that matters, all pieces were present and correct :-)

The finished model is a work of art. The detail and thought put into the 'vignettes' at the corners of the board is amazing. Usually with today's LEGO sets you often get the feeling they've skimped on parts or variety of parts to keep costs down. Not so with this set!

The only slightly disappointing thing about it (apart from the fact it won't fit back into the box fully assembled as noted by other reviewers) is that the black and white tiles on the playing board are all bit scratched up, probably because they've been preassembled, stacked and moved about. It might not bother you but I like my LEGO to be pristine :-)

So, if your a chess fan, get this set. If you're a castle fan, get this set: as I said before there's an incredible array of weapons, shields, minifigs and accessories, it's a great 'army builder'. How many other sets can you buy for £90 which have 33 minifigs in them?

"GerbilLord_3_14159","2008-08-28T11:09:45.84Z","The jewel of my Collection","This set is truly a sight, from its detailed realms to the weapon lined border. The picture can not even begin to show you how big this is! It is such a fun build that took me 5 hours, every second of which I was filled with joy. There is only one flaw, which is that the box is faulty, and does not hold the board. But although that keeps you from storing it in the box, who would want to? It makes for a great display! It is, unlike many other sets, not just hours or days of fun, but YEARS of it! This is in my humble opinion, the best set lego has ever made, and is the jewel of my collection. Why not make it the jewel of yours?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"chrisrankin","2009-01-28T14:46:17.09Z","Fantastic set with one MAJOR flaw","I wanted to chime in on this amazing set. First off, I agree with everything the previous posters stated so I'm not going to repeat all of that. This is a stunning set.

I can't explain how wonderful the presentation of this entire set is. And what I mean by that is not just the finished assembled set, but the entire process of opening the set up. The storage box is beautiful. When you open it the checker board is displayed on the left and all the pieces are individually presented in their own custom shaped space to fit the piece. These are all behind a clear sleeve that holds them in place. Once you remove the sleeve, the inside portion of the box (which holds the pieces) lifts out to reveal the assembled chess set. There are grooves in the base of the box to lock the chess set in place so it doesn't slide around. It essentially stays in the middle so you can store the chess set in the box without getting damaged. 

This is how it is supposed to work...The problem is that some packaging engineer made a mistake and when the set is assembled and placed in the box, once the inner box with the figures is placed on top, the lid (which holds the checker board) will not close. Basically the box is not deep enough by about 1.5 inches therefore not allowing the top lid to close.

An otherwise flawless execution in design and presentation is flawed by this mistake. Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing set. And you can still store the set in the box with all your chess player pieces thrown loosely into a ziplock bag in with the base of the set, then close the lid. But the beauty of it was how it all should have worked together. 

I thought I was an idiot so I actually dragged my entire set (assembled with the box) into the Lego store at King of Prussia Mall (PA) to have one of their people tell me where I went wrong. This part may get confusing for you (if you're not familiar with the packaging)... but the manager proceeded to rip the box portion (that is behind the area where the characters are supposed to be stored) off. She grabbed it with her hands and started to try to pull it off. She got it half way off when I told her to stop and that I didn't think that was going to solve anything. They brought their display sample out of the back room and they had destroyed their box to make the thing fit. It was a sloppy mess.

My point is that the packaging is horribly flawed, which might not normally be a big deal. But with a set like this the storage box is essential so you don't have to rebuild the set every time you want to play. 

Please let me know if anyone has heard more about this or if their are any other solutions. I would hope that with the popularity of this set, Lego will go into more manufacturing and additional printings of the boxes and presumably fix the mistake. For a set as expensive as this I would hope Lego would issue replacement boxes to those who request one. 

Sorry for the rant but I'm hoping for some answers from anyone. 

I wouldn't have been so disappointed if they never attempted to make a storage solution for the set. But for them to come so close to perfection and then making a mistake like this really stings. 

Don't let this posting deter you from getting the set. If you are a chess fan/Lego fan/Castle fan this is a must have. The packaging issue just took a bit of the shine off an otherwise stunning experience.

Feel free to contact me with thoughts.

"rainstorm26","2009-03-19T20:43:34.937Z","Awesome set - storage is rather confusing","<p>I bought this set right after lego.com stopped selling it. I was lucky enough to find one at the legoland discovery center near me. I was eyeing it for a long time. After I assembled it, I tried to figure out how to store it as I thought it should be able to be put all in the box nearly fully assembled. Well after almost ripping the parts box under the figure storage, I decided to send an e-mail to the lego customer support. They sent me back a nice PDF which shows how to store it properly. You do have to disassemble a few pieces to make it fit and also remove part of the parts box, but it is still alot better than trying to rip off the box and destroy the packaging.&nbsp; <strong>PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU NEED THE STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS.</strong><br />
<br />
I love this set. The details are incredible and it is a great set to play chess. I bought it to inspire my son to learn and like to play chess, so it is great as he loves lego&#39;s almost as much as I do.<br />
