"Ferocious_Waterbuffalo","2009-02-05T16:32:27.687Z","Great Early Set","I can't remember how long ago I got this set but it has been part of my ""KEEP TOGETHER"" collection since then. The stretchers always came in handy and the suitcase was so new and cool back then. Having the different vehicles numbered I always thought was a cool feature, having the 1 (motorcycle) arrive first to the accident and so on. A great early set that satisfied builders medical needs until the new emergency theme came out in 2006. Sure it old but its still hanging around.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

(motor, car, ambulance, small helicopter). Because of this variety very collectible for, Town, vehicle, ambulance helicopter etc. collectors. <br><br>On the other hand, I find (especially the ambulance and car) a bit bizarre looking (to futuristic) and when we take a closer look at the series it now consists of 5 vehicles, but no home base available. This sub-theme later became Res-Q that was released form 1998 on and came with a home base (set 6479).<br><br><br>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
