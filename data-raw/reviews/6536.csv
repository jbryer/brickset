"Resurgam","2008-12-22T10:29:25.327Z","Too Expensive!","This is the latest &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; set I have purchased, and I'm fairly happy with it.  I haven't ever been totally disappointed with one yet, but this one is too expensive.  It probably should have been $20, $25 at the most because it's limited edition, but seriously!

Pros:
* Limited edition
* Very true to the show
* Very cool interior

Cons:
* Very expensive
* Same old Patrick minifigure

I'd say buy it if you're a fan of the show or need the parts, but be wary of the price!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-08-29T20:22:21.243Z","Many useful elements, poor design","<p>When the Spongebob Squarepants theme was introduced, I thought the sets were kind of cool and funny looking. However, my smile nearly&nbsp;turned upside down once I bought this set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start off, you get a Spongebob, Patrick, and doctor minifigure. You also get great little details such as the desk, computer, stretcher, intravenous bags (the clear blue 1x1 round bricks that are&nbsp;mounted on the pole), cabinet, sink, cup,&nbsp;x-ray, clipboard, charts, and a rare drawer. You also get those 1x6x6 log walls, 1x6x5 panels, white half-arches, and grey half-cylinders, which make up the chimneys. The seaweed pieces are also a nice touch, and the tan baseplate can easily be used for a beach.&nbsp;Lastly, when you compare this&nbsp;hospital with the one from the cartoon, they actually look fairly alike! (I laughed when I found this out)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also get an ambulance complete with a back area for storing the stretcher, but other than that, the ambulance is fairly boring. There is a parking area for the ambulance adjacent to the hospital, plus a sign that says ""parking"".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My largest complaint is the design of the hospital. Now I know this set was meant for playability but that doesn't excuse for such a poorly designed hospital. There is no left wall and the roof is completely missing. The back of the building, however, can be left blank such that the interior can be accessed (this was always how Lego buildings were), but no wall or roof is just ridiculous. What you are left with is either a building still under construction, or two useless walls which serve no purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is an average set. I recommend you get this set for the pieces, but other than that, you are not missing out on anything if you don't own this set. In my opinion, the show is better than the sets :)</p>",TRUE,3,5,4,3,4
"cassidyarch","2009-04-16T23:07:46.11Z","A Genuine Oddity","Spongebob has made for a real mixed bag, as far as set quality goes.

There have been some surprises, both the Fish Bus and the Krusty Krab were nicely done, solid sets with high playability. This one doesn't work quite as well.

I got this set on a great S@H clearance sale. $9.00, and that really is the perfect price for it. It comes with the Purple Fish Doctor, and a really well-printed Spongebob with bandaged head--both totally exclusive to this set.

The ambulance is very minimal, it may hold the record for ""LEGO Ambulance built with the fewest pieces."" And the hospital itself is very slight--it does come with some REALLY nice light blue doors.

My four year old daughter cried when I finished the build. She kept saying, ""It's not finished! Make it HIGHER! It's NOT FINISHED!""

She hit the nail right on the head.  ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

A lot like how it is the show.<br><br>Building: Has good features like the hospital bed, a computer, charts on the walls, and storage. It needs a waiting&nbsp; room.<br><br>Minifigures: I love the doctor fish head, he's really well made. Spongebob and his bandaged head is clever and cool. Patrick...he's grinning when his best friend got in some accident....<br><br>Ambulance: Good design, firm, but needs doors.<br><br>Overall this is a fun and&nbsp; excellent set that is worth the price,<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
