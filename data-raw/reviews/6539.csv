Many bricks, which one could use to build many interesting things, and interesting small buildings. There are pictures of tram on the original box, which may be built from the set.
Beautiful set - classic!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

When finished, they were just as interested in it as the recent City sets they currently enjoy so much. Though we're missing the marked baseplate, I was able to sub in a green 16x24 (or bigger, of course).<div><br></div><div>This set also has many useful parts in building other things: the windmill blades are comprised of 8 yellow 1x4 fences, &amp; the windmill base has plenty of black slopes &amp; (12!) corners you could use for a roof. I think the 1x2 white windows are rare too, plus the truck windscreen you don't see much of.</div><div><br></div><div>I was amused by my boys' questions about the aspects of this vintage set: ""Why don't the guys have arms/legs/faces? How do they fit in the buildings? How do they drive the truck?"" I just explained things were different back then when I was 4, &amp; old sets can be just as fun as those nowadays.</div><div><br></div><div>Next step- hook up the motor to the windmill!</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
