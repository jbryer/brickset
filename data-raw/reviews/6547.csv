Don't get confused now.","<p>Well this is a very simple set in terms of construction and parts, yet it gives you a small set of relatively useful parts, like the Toa Mata Pohatu's arms in Black and the Matoran Body Armor in Flat Silver. <br></p><p>In terms of playability it is simple, you have the classic ""Inertia based"" disk throwing mechanism, using the Tohunga arm for his tail, that can give you some hours of fun while practicing accuracy against another sets or just a can/box. <br></p><p>The most convincing point about this set is the fact that it is promotional, that means FREE PARTS, and makes him a must have for collectors like me. One of the bad sides of promotional sets is the lack of story background, and Kraatu is no exception, the only thing mentioned about him is that he is a common Matoran Pet in Metru Nui, and even that is not fully canonical...</p>

<p>As I said this is a very simple set, but of course we can't ask for much more relating a promotional.</p><p>I hope you liked my review and that was useful to you. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
