For one, the designer had to work with pieces that were available in the Factory, which means a few cases where plates were used where LEGO-designed set would have done a brick, or some other combined piece. It increases the brick count, though that also means that the pieces included are a little more flexible than they might be otherwise.

The second thing is the level of detail in the designs. The radar on the base uses 5 dishes. The large rock piece is adorned with small 1x1 slopes to give it a slightly more natural look. Throughout the set there are little details added to break up the surfaces and make the designs more interesting.

I think the designer also did a great job of capturing the flavor of classic space while updating it newer pieces and new ideas.

Definitely a fantastic set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The detail used in some parts of this set with the use of bricks gives this an almost &quot;deluxe&quot; feel.

Lets look at all the sections to this set -

&quot;Outpost 7&quot; base - Its quite small, so it shouldn't be called a base. It really is just an outpost. However since this is the only Star Justice set that will probably ever be released it'll have to do as their home!
That being said what is here is great. The base itself is a small room holding a large array of computers. Below the ladders move out the way to reveal a rack of energy weapons for three of the four members.
To the side of the base is a large recharge generator, and rack for two fully charged cells and a platform to hold a cell while it is being charged. Each part is made with great detail.

I wish the designer found some way to use the empty area with the rocky mountain piece as the way it is its just some unused space. Also a large flat monitor above the computers in the main room would have completed the look instead of having a blank wall.

Mobile cargo transport - the land vehicle of the set, and although a transport it can double up as the tank of the group too. The suspension and steering used for the vehicle make it fun to roll around and it also lowers at the back to transport one of two pallettes. A nice extra is that its powered by one of the energy cells from the outpost. Its overall look reminds me of classic old lego space which is very nice.

Hypersled - The smaller aerial vehicle, this seems to be a short distance &quot;police bike&quot; or hovercraft. On each wing and under the nose are three large jets which lift up when taking off and which you can lower to use as undercarriage when it lands. It has a well designed engine using multiple parts on the back. I would have easily bought this on its own as its overall design is just really well done.

&quot;Peace Keeper&quot; - The larger aerial vehicle and probably the part people looking a pic like the most upon seeing, the Peace Keeper is the only part of the set to actually have &quot;Star Justice&quot; written on it instead of just having the squads logo. Its overall design is of a futuristic police car with an amazingly well made engine on the rear, the side guns and cockpit are also great designs. With a bit of converting it could be possible to make it a two seater.

Extra's - The set also comes with a squad of three robots lead by a different looking fourth robot, a pallette with fuel tanks and another with what looks like chemicals for the cargo transport. Although nothing special by themselves they really round out the set and give the impression this is an entire specialist team.

One problem with this set overall however is the bags are not numbered meaning when you open them all up you have a lot of bricks to trawl through when building. I won't knock a point off though as the set when finished is so impressive you won't mind the longer bulding time it takes to complete.

If you are a fan of Lego space this is worth the price. If you have sets from the Mars Mission series this set mixes in well, giving you some police who are maybe trying to keep the peace between the humans and aliens!

Highly recommended for lego space fans and a worthy recommendation to everyone else.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-10-05T23:48:27.497Z","At least Space is Back","I was never a fan of Lego Space. However, there are alot of people that are, so I looked at this and it is interesting. It reminds me of the old Space Police sets and the modern day town sets. Lego was smart to release this under the Factory line because it would have gone bad if it was its own theme. The thing I don't like about this is the rover. The rover looks lame and shouldn't be there or much improved. This isn't bad though but this will make space fans happy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-21T22:46:28.53Z","Not too bad","Although i prefer the space skulls to this, i do think it is neat how a fan desinged this. One of my faovrite parts the hypersled, it looks exactly like it's name describes. The rovor has nice wheels and the ship is incredibly sleek. The robots are somewhat uneeded but still add to the set. The base-area is compeltly unnessacary and the worst part of it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
