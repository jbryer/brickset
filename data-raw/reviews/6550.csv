"BRICK_101","2008-05-20T00:25:44.403Z","A leap in the right direction","When details of this set (and the related Star Justice) first leaked onto the internet I got very excited for three reasons.

1) As much as I enjoy the Star Wars sets, their existence has meant a complete lack of traditional space sets (Life on Mars doesn't count) for the past nine years. Think of all the different themes Castle has been able to explore during that time: Ninjas, Vikings, and Skeletons and just the highlights. 

2) Being Factory sets, these sets were designed by Lego fans. This is a trend that I would love to see continue since the fan designed stuff tends to be as good as (or better than) the very best of the official Lego designed stuff. 

3) It looks freaking awesome!

I picked it up at the local Lego store a few weeks back and put it together and found that the set is just as cool as it looks. The giant skull definitely takes the cake, both in terms of building techniques and looking cool. SNOT techniques are used extensively  and to good effect. I also very much liked the smaller skull ship and the little skullbot. The troop transport is nothing spectacular.

My only complaints about this set are: There is no base/building for the Space Skulls, since this is likely to be the only set released in the theme, it would have been nice to give them at least a small outpost. There are several times where 3 plates are stacked on top of each other to make a brick. I understand that was done because there are restrictions on what pieces can be used in Factory sets, but it does inflate the piece count quite a bit. Thus the set is a little pricier than it should be.

Overall it's a fantastic set with great playability and display-ability. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The skull starship is really stupid and even the small hovercraft has one too. However, I do like the minifigures, but this set is just a failure for a comeback. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"absolutelylez","2009-09-25T05:18:33.077Z","Useful parts but monotonous building","This is a great set to buy - ON DISCOUNT. I only bought it when Legoshop was trying to get rid of it, at only Â£13. What a deal! So many pieces!

I originally wanted to build the whole thing to have a play about with it to see whether other people's reviews were accurate. But honestly, I got so bored building that I only built what I had really bought it for - The gigantic skull! Which admittedly is very very nicely designed, and is now incorporated into a very scary pirates MOC :)

Pros: great design of skull, lots of pieces, varied models
Cons: repetitive building",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The machine itself looks deadly and the smaller ships are nice. Space skull minifigs could have been better but the ships make up for that.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"spyder38","2009-03-31T17:27:21.997Z","Planetary Domination","They will take over the nearest space to them, including your living room! The set is sold out now, however I got it on sale at Lego.com for $20. Yep, that's right. $20. I wasn't planning on buying this, but when it went on sale, I purchased it as a parts piece. However, I did not expect to love it! It has so many great building techniques and looks really smooth and clean in the end. The red highlights are great and the set has lots of detail. The one thing I did not expect was that you have to apply stickers to the space skulls-their torsos are not printed, but this is because it is a Factory set. The man who designed this set did an awesome job with the limited pieces on Lego Factory. Buy it cheap online! It has many great pieces including 66 red translucent pieces, 4 green cylinders, 2 control panels, 44 white 1x3 slopes, 7 printed sewer pieces, and much more! Buy it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"wildwill","2009-04-13T23:59:10.89Z","Buy it for cheap, great parts","There's a ton of great parts here, and the models aren't too horrible (with the exception of the small two-person flyer, that one is just abysmal.  The large skullhead with the tentacles is the best one here, it's got heft to it, and those twelve legs make it nasty looking too.  The Skull-Viper (hey it looks like a Viper to me) has some neat features, but the wings aren't very secure.  I like the smaller robot, but then again I like small bots.

Four figs come with the set, complete with stickets to customize them.  Oh boy, stickers.  

At the $20 price point for the blowout sale, this is a great set.  You can't possibly be disappointed by the sheer amount of bricks you get for the price.  Problem is you'll probably never build the set once you take it apart.  Hey if you want to make some Matrix customs, you've got all the dark-tentacle pieces you need.
