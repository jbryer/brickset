It includes rare pieces and has good detail in it. Although indy is the same ...again, he is missing the bag around his body making it easier to put him in a seat without a hassle.

pros: rare green pieces

solid design

sturdy

can be used with any set in the theme

cons: same old indy

Although indy is the same except for the bag it doesn't bring any value down. The car is still a great set to get ahold of. I just wish some new indiana jones outfits are made in the near future. I rate it a 8.5/10, still good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Indy is an awesome fig to get in an exclusive set. The dark green plates are great but the majority of bricks are black, not dark green. The design is quite intelligent as it utilizes 1x2x2 brackets and 12 headlight bricks to build a 3 wide body that fits atop a 4 wide wheelbase. This set does not come with Indy's satchel but it does include his whip! This would be a resounding 5 if it were a small $4.99 set at retail but this really adds to the value of the Brickmaster subscription because this set is so good, much better than the Bat bot from January!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

For such a small set it's well detailed, I have all the other IJ sets and this is my favourite vehicle from the range.

A friend gave it to me but it's since been dismantled and I have no instructions!
I can't find any source on the net, can anyone help me out?

"MandalorianCandidate","2008-12-25T15:21:39.297Z","Thumbs up, Brickmaster","I'm not a member of the Brickmaster program, but this set has made me think about joining.  I don't recall there being a minifig-oriented set before (I thought they were all mini sets) but this one is kind of nice for the scale.

I think Brickmaster is about $40 for 5-6 sets throughout the year, so with the 83 parts that would translate to appx. $7-9 this is not a bad deal.  As was mentioned by other reviewers, this is not a spectacular set by any means, so if this is your lone IJ set then whoop-di-do.  Combined with the other KotCS sets (it has the same dark green/black color scheme) or maybe even with the 7622 Race for the Stolen Treasure set this is a cool little addition.  I have mine set up with the Jungle Cutter and River Chase sets.

There's no moving parts other than the wheels, but it does come with the ubiquitous Dr. Jones (sans leather bag) and a place to put some stolen booty and guns in the back.  That's it.

This is a solid little jeep with smooth lines.  Right out of the box, I'd give it a 4.5, but let's transform it into a 5...  The first thing it needs is more ground clearance, and full size wheels to make it a match all the vehicles in the full size Indy sets.  You can get all the extra parts on bricklink for less than a dollar...

1) You need 4x light-bluish-gray wheels, part #56902.

2) You need 4x tires, part #3483.

3) You need 8x black jumper plates, part #3794.  Using eight is more sturdy.

Now...

1) First, take off one of the axle plates that hold the wheels.  Notice that it has four studs on top.

2) Attach four jumper plates onto those four studs, so that each jumper plate is attached to just one stud...  There is only one possible way to do this...  When you've got it right, each jumper plate will be half attached and half sticking outward, forwards or backwards.  Then, do the exact same thing again on the other axle.

3) Now, when you re-attach those assemblages to the underside of the jeep, the axles will both be lowered by one plate, and they will each be half a stud closer to the center.  This puts the axles right in the middle of the green wheel wells, it makes the undercarriage more jacked-up looking, and it makes the jeep perfect for the standard Indiana Jones wheels...  Now it goes perfect with the other Indy sets!  =)

I have also posted a few quick and easy mods for the Shanghai Chase, #7682.

Fortune and Glory!

If Brick Master had been continuing, if this is the type and quality of sets that you can get, it'd have been well worth considering to join up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is on par with size, piece count&nbsp;and quality of a $5-$10 dollar set. The jeep design is a very solid build... I let my daughter who was 2 yrs old a the time play with it under supervision. The only real draw back is if you've been collecting any of the other Indiana Jones sets, you've got yet another Indy minifigure with his famous whip, fedora and leather jacket he wears.</p>
