This key chain is basic (like all the keychains), and it features a police officer minifigure, the same minifigure from the set 7235 (police motorcycle, from the police theme), but with a hat instead of a helmet.
The details are very good, and it is very well designed. The main color is black, grey (the hands of the minifig are gray colored, do not confuse with black), and the hat is white. The minifigure's face is commonly yellow, and this have a printed &quot;sun glasses&quot; and a beard. 

As a key chain, you cannot use this minifigure in other sets, only placing the legs (feet) in the studs of any brick. The minifig is connected to the key chain in the head, body and legs. But you can move the minifig's arms, hands, legs and you can move the head, but a bit hardly. But anyway, as a key chain it is pretty cool.

I got two of these for free, and also, two 852445 (Golden 2x4 brick key chain)for free, during an event here in S&#227;o Paulo, with participation of the LUG Brasil (group of Lego users from Brazil), group where I am a member.

The playability of this set is limited, but as a key chain of a minifig, it of course isn't bad. This set isn't a good option to people who makes very much creations (called as &quot;MOCers&quot;), but to a collector, it is very useful. And currently you can get it by &#163;2.99 in United Kingdom or US$3.99 in United states. A good price for a key chain, that is simple. Overall, a good key chain for any collector.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
