"water_jedi_17","2008-09-21T15:11:16.92Z","great design ,but why never officially released??","  First off there are pics of this set on brickshelf. Second, I don't really know why lego didn't publicly release this set. On to the review.
 This is a Tank Droid like the one in the wookie attack set. The middle part is a 6X1 piece. There are two side parts that come out the sides which are weakly connected(like the wings in the mini vader's tie set).There are four blue saucer pieces that protect the interior. they are connected by side pieces that come out from the interior. Two ridge pieces act like the treads while the larger two have harpoon like pieces that act like cannons. Finally, the eyes are a telephone piece with orange 1x1 studs. Unfortunately ,I can't describe this set as well without you looking at a pic. 

Pros
- Rare orange pieces
- realistic details

Cons
- never officially released (this made this set a four)
