For a promo this set offers a variety of pieces that are only available in more expensive sets. The most prominent is Axxon’s kanohi. The ‘body’ compromises of only two bionilce pieces that end with sockets on both sides(sorry if I’m confusing but I’m just giving descriptions of the pieces, as they don’t have an official name) The blade seems to be the only weapon, although I have seen this weapon repeated many times since 2005. Finally the legs are quite new, introduced the same year as this set was released, making the new piece more available to the public.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
