I like the dual propellors on each side and the space inside. All the other stuff is cool, but the plane is the best part of this set. Period.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2008-07-19T03:23:33.577Z","vintage aircraft isn't all that fantastic.","the star of this set is of course the vintage aircraft fully equipped with retractable landing wheels and large propellors from the 1950s era. i think this is a great idea for a lego set. 

however, the aircraft has too many flaws, namely that the cabin windows are all stickers. without these large compulsory stickers, the entire upper portion of the aircraft is one big clear windshield. the designer could have used white and yellow bricks throughout the entire fuselage with only clear bricks for the windows to eliminate the use of stickers - which wear and tear off quite easily; and if they are large, there is no second chance, and they look awkward when you apply them on wrongly.

the cabin area is a bit awkward too. there is a hatch you can open to load up cargoes, but there is no door leading up to the seating area and there is no connecting pathway from the cargo hatch to the seating area because the hatch is the only way to enter the aircraft. yes, the seating area is completely sealed off, so the only way to get inside is to lift off the roof (and the &quot;windows&quot;). what's the use for that mobile stairway then?

this set features all the major mini-figures minus marion, and comes with a crystal skull - something they forgot to include in the &quot;tent&quot; set!

overall, it is just a nice set, though not amazing.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Lost_Cosmonaut","2008-08-25T14:55:05.373Z","Excellent set, GREAT value.","I've had this set for month or so now and I have to say, this is an EXCELLENT set.  Certainly one of the best LEGO airplanes I've ever had the pleasure to build.  Very solid.  Some of the features don't make sense, and the detail on the inside is of course lacking, but overall it's still a great set.  The attention to detail on the outside is excellent.  It's nice to see an airplane set that isn't made of big DUPLO-ish parts!

TONS of mini-figs too!  This set at $50 is an amazing value, based on the piece count and number of mini-figs alone I would have expected to pay $70 or so.  For $50, this is a can't miss set, doesn't matter if you're an Indy fan; this set appeals to LEGO airplane collectors as well!

"Loganwan","2008-11-30T22:34:11.873Z","Solid Set, Great Design","This is by far my favorite vehicle set.  The airplane is excellently designed.  It looks very period correct, as well as just being a really big, nice-looking plane. One of my hopes has always been to have an area large enough in my house to display an airport, and this is going to be the central focal of the design.

The truck is good, the tractor is well designed with two trailers, and lots of minifigs.  Oh great, another Indiana Jones.  Oh well.

I highly recommend this set to anyone who likes Lego planes.  With working gear, it just looks great!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"indykid","2008-08-10T01:52:37.107Z","Too Amazing for words!","This set is so amazing! I got it yesterday and i was playing with it so much that I havent done muche else. I love this set so much that the plane was with me when i went to sleep. Lets name all the pros: Awesome plane, has cargo area, pilot area, and passenger area; cool minifigs, Indy, Mutt, Spalko, Dovchenko, Russian Guard, and Cool Pilot; has 3 cargo pallots(Swords, crates, and red cylinders) and a crate that can hold a pistol, the map, and the skull; Has cool cccp truck with room for either the crate or a pallot; the cargo car and stairs are a bonus to the set and they come with tools too.  Cons: some decals.  I don't believe whoever says this is a bad set because this is the best set ever in my opinion. Definitely a must have! Overall 15/10! i highly reccommend this set to anyone, indy fan or not!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"THX_1138","2008-11-02T12:29:22.607Z","Awesome, despite hardly being in the movie at all","This is a very awesome set. Although it's not saying much since Lego hasn't done many planes and hardly any of this kind, it is probably the best plane Lego has ever done.

Pros: 
-Not too expensive even at TRU's increased price (I got mine on sale though and used a $10 off $100 or more purchase).
-Lots of great minifigs. Mutt and Irina are awesome. Another airport worker or two like a mechanic or something would have been nice, but still a great selection of figs.
-The plane is very realistic. I love the folding landing gear.
-The tractor, trailers, Jeep and cargo are nice touches.
-The sword rack is very cool.
-The Skull is awesome.

Cons:
-This isn't a con to me, but some people might care about the fact that it isn't really in the movie.
-Again, not a con to me but some people don't like stickers.
-The stickers on the windows are too dark. This can be fixed by putting masking tape under the stickers, though.
-The steering wheel blocks the controls, although this is w=very  minor and it can be replaced by the extra lever they include.
-The fenders on the tractor look a little weir when viewed from the side or front.

You should definitely get this if you can. 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"AlterBrick__Vienna__Austria","2009-08-03T17:13:11.2Z","4 due to stickers - else 5!","Yes, it would deserve a 5 - but only if the Douglas DC3 (see: http://www.richard-seaman.com/Wallpaper/Aircraft/Civil/DeltaAirlinesDc3_1.jpg) were fully brickbuilt.
But the magic of its look comes from 4 huge stickers, which depict the windows. So place them well on the semi-cylindres - don't spoil it!
There would be already good parts to actually build this!
YES IT LOOKS ""5"" - the building technique is only 4.
Important pro-point: It is very sturdy for playing!

The Russian Jeep deserves a straight 5 in every way: It looks great even without the ""CCCP""-sticker - excellent building with SNOT-techniques!

The tractor and the 2 trailers with interesting functions (and some SNOT-building) repeat the fine color-scheme of the aircraft, which is a combination of yellow and (rare!) dark blue. Almost a 5, I would say.

The playability seems - as far as I remember - huge (=""5""!), due to a lot of ""good & bad"" minifigs, several vehicles including the great Jeep and the beautiful DC3 and loads of accessory including the ""thing"", what the chase is all about: A CRYSTAL-SKULL which can be hidden in numerous places!

SEE IT - BUY IT! Even if you dislike stickers as much as I do.

"xhunter94s","2010-06-14T18:25:52.03Z","AMAZING SET!","<p>&nbsp; I got this on Ebay for $60. The box is huge but doesn't show enough of the awesomeness of this set! </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off.......</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The plane<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The plane is big but not as big as the flimsy plane from the Raiders of the Lost Ark<em> </em>set. It is big enough though. There are stickers which are easy to put on&nbsp;but you MUST<strong> </strong>put them on carefully for the plane to look&nbsp;good. The cockpit fits one person and is small but I love it, it has a radar board like on the Penguin's sub&nbsp;and the original&nbsp;Lego batmobile. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area for passengers can fit 3 people (Marion, Indy, and Mutt) and the area for cargo can fit 2 people (Batman and Robin! I have no idea why they would need to take a plane:).&nbsp;The area where cargo goes has a hinge to slide luggage through. The top comes off in the passenger area/ cargo area and the top comes off the cockpit area.&nbsp;The wings are very stable and sturdy. I like the design of the entire plane.&nbsp;The propellers are awesome they have a good design. Lego was very creative with this<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jeep&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The Jeep is the most creative vehicle Lego has made. You never know what you will do to built what. So many twists and turns you could never guess in the building process, it's great! I put the brown box the long way in the back of this jeep, it just fits. The driver's area fits one person. You can put two people on the sides hanging onto the bars. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can put three people on the back (if you have the box in the back only). If you put it next to the Batmobile from Two Face's escape next to it it looks ...(magnified=puny)(well so does any vehicle next to the Lego Batmobile from Two Face's escape)(My word! If vehicles look that small next to that Batmobile, imagine vehicles next to the deluxe batmobile ,gasp! ahhhh!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, it is a good vehicle, a great add to my collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Tractor thingy with the stairs and cart</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>These things are slighty necassary, Not completely, slightly. They are stable like everything in this set. The cargo holder thing can hold the dynamite or the boxes. The tractor is small but interesting. It fits one person. The stairs are flat and light, honey mustard colored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since they are flat mini figures cannot really stay on while the vehicle is moving. The cargo one holds a wrench and a hammer on one row/side on the other row/side is two flashy things that airport workers have and move in different directions to tell pilots where&nbsp;to park. Both carts connect to the main tractor in both the front and back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>There is Indiana Jones&nbsp;in his normal outfit. Irina Spalko, with a new face, well at least I think it's a new face. There is Mutt, same hair as the Robin in the submarine and scuba jet set (try saying scuba jet set as fast as you can 20 times HAHAHAHA), except Mutt's hair is brown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Colonel D-something-c-something-v-something, same sour face as usual. He has the hat that I put on my old&nbsp;Shortround figure because I could not find his baseball hat ( I used to have Jungle Cutter set,&nbsp;temple with the ark set, the temple of doom car chase set, and maybe a few others).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Russian soldier same green suit, Belloq face.&nbsp;Finally the pilot, he is the&nbsp;Bruce Wayne figure except he has a white version of colonel's cap<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weapons, extras, etc</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are alot of weapons.&nbsp;There is&nbsp;are 2 grey knives, two Irina Spalko swords, one grail knight-like sword, one golden (not real gold, not even metal) katana (a.k.a:Ninja Sword), a whip, a pistol or two, big dynamite, and my personal favorite the SHOTGUN!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For extras and etc. there is a rack that holds the katana and grail knight&nbsp;sword. There are three pairs of grey handcuffs (better than the ones in the Lego Batman sets).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall this set is really awesome! I would recommend it to an eldery person (but not a baby, there are parts not meant for children under 3) to someone who isn't a Lego fan (but has patience and the ability to do a Lego ;).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"AETerry","2011-05-10T14:52:17.527Z","Peril in Peru Review","<p>This set provided me with something of a leap of faith to start making on-line purchases through the Lego.com Store when searching for a set(s) to complete out a theme.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plane is actually larger than what the pic shows (to me at least) and is a very solid build. I've had it fall, crashing off a shelf and it largely held together with only the tail needing reassembly. There are stickers, most of which are for the plane, but that was okay for me at least.</p>

<p>Two vehicles with a little trailer hitch and some mini-build accessories. There's a crate that's holding the Crystal Skull I presume, gas tanks, weapon stand.
