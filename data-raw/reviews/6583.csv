I think this set is perfect!                                                                          P.S. It makes a good enemy for the toa.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-11-07T12:33:33.153Z","This is the Klakk","This set was released a few months ago, alongside a brickmaster magazine edition, as a promotional set from the Bionicle theme.

According to the Bionicle storyline, this &quot;Rahi&quot; (Rahi is any type of biomechanical animal of the Bionicle universe) is named as Klakk, and have the power to cure the shadow matoran (8947- Radiak; 8948- Gavla and 8949- Kirop, for example) from the Shadow Leeches launched by the Makuta's Tridax Pods (The Makuta who includes Tridax Pods are 8691- Antroz; 8692- Vamprah; 8693- Chirox; 8952- Mutran and 8953- Icarax).

This set at the first view looks very simple, and it really is. With only 38 pieces, the building is easy and not much complex, you only needs to connect the torso piece to a technic beam (connect with technic pins). After, you have only to connect the &quot;hand pieces&quot; to each balljoint, and add the increasements.
This set uses a Toa Metru head as it's face. On each side, there are connected two pieces which are also used as the small rockets of the Toa Nuva (Mistika version).

The design isn't very good, because it don't have much bird-like resemblances on the face, though the claws and wings suggests a bird.

Altough the Klakk don't show an exceptional building (also for a medium-sized figure), he is very interesting in terms of pieces. All the 38 pieces are so much useful to the Bionicle theme, especially to increase the &#180;08 sets. Pieces like the silver colored claws, the black wings and the blade used in the heads' back. Also, if you needs a Bionicle head and eyes, this can be a good option.

The playability, like in all medium-sized Bionicle figures, is very good, the balljoints makes the set be well playable, without any problem with its structure. But of course, this set have small limbs (it is suggested to be a bird-like Rahi), what frustates a bit the playability. 

You can get it by bricklink, with a price of $6,00 to $15,00. And as this set was released with a brickmaster magazine edition, it was free for the people who signed up the magazine (unfortunately, there isn't a way to get brickmaster magazines from all the countries).

Overall, this set is a nice set for the Bionicle fans who searches for new pieces, due to the useful pieces included, but the building and design frustates the set. And an interesting fact is that this set, though is a promotional, have only two pieces less than the 8694 (Krika), which you can find by $13,00 in some stores. Anyways, this set is a three out of five.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

And when you actualy build it the insanity just builds even higher. But it still is a pretty cool set.",FALSE,4,4,4,4,3

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The use of swords for larger wings is quite genius, and creative.<br></li><li>-The addition of all the things to a mask is also awesome.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-This guy would die instantly because he has no other armor. <br></li><li>-This set also could use some regular legs, as I'm not sure how it should stand up.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>All in all, I like this set; it's essential to story, has many smart techniques (the mask holder), and comes to be worth around six dollars. Buy it, but don't pay too much. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
