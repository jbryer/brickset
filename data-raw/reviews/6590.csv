I bought this set, because it was reduced to 40 Euro. Regular price in german stores is 70 Euro (minimum). And spoken clearly: It's not worth that price. My rating relates on building free style (with the parts provided with this set) and getting this set for an reduced price. Building it the Duplo way and paying full price - I would give 0 bricks. Yes. Zero.

This is (funny somehow) the only Duplo building that is not destroyed by my son every hour. He loves to play with this castle after the modification using the bricks and parts included in the package. Of course: A ground plate in combination with Duplo buildings is always a good decision. It now has enough space to park the fire truck and all his plastic toy animals are living in the castle. Sometimes the mighty shark comes for a short visit (means 1 animal is missing) and the pirates for a little bit of ""conversation"": First they all have to go through the trap door. Then they are showing the animals how to fly - pirate style. And finally (after they had french fries), they tear down the tower, load it upon their pirate ship and leave with flickering lights and siren-sound. 

Those who are building sets always exactly like the manual: Better spend your money on other sets. You and your kids will not be happy. If you dare the task and the tears (of course), read ""Assembling WITH manual"". May the force be with you. All the others go straight to ""Assembling WITHOUT manual"".

Assembling WITH manual:
*shiver* Hmmm... Okay. Easy. The manual is nothing special. While building you will notice the hilarious light construction and the instability. Later on, the manual shows you how to build the crashing walls. Simply stack one brick onto the other. Wait... How will they fall to pieces? They won't. You better plug them loose-fitting. The tower with the trap door is an stand-alone-element and nothing to worry about. You will only notice the always-open trap door. But that's okay. Looks not good, but is a good finger-practice for your kids. Once all is set up, your kids firing the cannonball at the walls and starting to play with the set - make sure that you have no appointments for the next years. You will be the Repairmaster (instead of the Dungeonmaster). After Rebuild no. 188 (within 1 hour) you will perhaps try the free style way. So, get rid of the manual and read on...

Assembling WITHOUT manual:
Once you've thrown away the manual (or sold it on the flea market or elsewhere), make sure that you have an ground plate ready. If there's no ground plate available, an ordinary L-Shape will do it, too. Once you tried a little bit you will also be able to include the breaking walls. Or reduce to only one breaking wall and use the remaining blocks for increasing your castles size. Make a photo and send it to Lego ;)

Bright side of the moon:
+ Enough bricks and parts for own and better creations
+ Minifigs with cool oversized weapons
+ Trapdoor (which is always open)
+ One 8x16 plate

Dark side of the moon:
- Worst construction I've ever seen (defines ""instable"" in an completely new way)
- Breaking wall feature will not work if assembled like shown in the manual (easy to see for adults, but not for kids)

Additional stuff:
Yes, this set bugged me. Don't know how this could pass a quality check. By the way: Have an closer look at the package. The bricks are flying in which direction? The Duplo cannon ball was taken away by us, because our son enjoyed to shoot at his 4 month old sister and the plasma ;)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
