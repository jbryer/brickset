"Yoda____","2008-10-28T17:08:58.983Z","Free is the magic number","I got this set with the daily mirror and am glad that i did. It's realy cool and definately worth 40p I say that it costs 40p because the paper costs that much and it was rubbish. However when I was playing with it I dropped on a hard floor and the wheel broke so that it doesn't clip on to the bike properly. People who have this, watch out.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"_add_um","2008-10-31T21:25:52.233Z","Makes a great gift!!","I got this with the Irish daily mirror the promotion was also in the UK (but not in the US). I have to say I'm lucky for once, Ireland rarly ever get promotions like this. What's there to say.. well its pretty basic set, it comes in a polobag, it includes the very rare orange motorcycle and the biker (just if your curious the minifig face is the one with orange sunglasses on ;]) You also get a spare visor and 'T' piece. Having the bat-tank and indy motorcycle chase I'm very proud to say that I have all the motorcyles LEGO have brought out so far. Very enjoyable set and goes great with other coastguard sets. It would have been nice if they were more pieces and because of this I'd give it a 3/5 :]",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This is included in the 2009 Power Miners set called 'Crystal Reaper'. The minifig is like all other coat guard ones. If you can get it cheaply, this is a good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Xwing250","2008-12-03T14:44:22.92Z","A good minifig!","I like the coast guard in this set and I also like the bikes features. But not the bike! ORANGE? Good only with other coast guard sets but not by its own. I prefered the other DM sets to this. The only good part is the minifig!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
