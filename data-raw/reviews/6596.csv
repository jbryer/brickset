I found it in the Easter Section along with 8033 Mini General Grievous' Starfighter in the bottom part of the aisle. This set is very detailed and looks alike to the bigger one. I love how they made the wings fold to attack position. I definetely think this set deserves a 4.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MandalorianCandidate","2009-04-08T13:21:17.187Z","Better than the $55 original","I know it’s only a MINI, but this is the Cadillac of MINIs!  I really dug the original MINI sets that came out in 2002 and were perpetuated the next few years.  Every time a new set comes out I get really jazzed because they are not that common any more and are a nice (and cheap!) way of getting Lego ships.

I thought this originally came out last year as a Brickmaster set, but I could be mistaken.  I actually bought the parts on bricklink and with instructions I found on the lego website made my own, but it’s nice to see it released by Target.

The wings don’t have a flipping mechanism like the full-scale 7674 set, but hey, it’s a MINI.  What do you want?!  They use a couple of simple, but sturdy, hinges instead.

The other nice detail is the stampographed republic insignia on the wing.  They could have gone the route of the clone battle pack and used a sticker instead.  

Even though that’s all it is, the MINI representation is a nicely scaled-down version that sticks faithfully to the design of the original…and that’s all we ask for, right?

Here is the closing of that review:

Final thoughts

At $3.99 for 66 pieces, it's a good deal if you need parts from it. If not, there always the 8033 Lego Mini General Greivus set which ""only"" has 44 count, but still $3.99.

To see the full size pictures, please goto my flicker site: Mini V-19 Torrent

My rating:

Playability: 4 out of 5. It’s swooshable. It's a mini. Stick it in your jacket pocket and take it with you.
Design: 3 out of 5. Very good job. I think a few things could've made it better like what IlikePi said, ""Where's the other republic insignia for the other wing?"" 
Build experience: 2 out of 5. This was easy. As I mentioned before, hard to get it wrong with so little pieces.
Overall: 5 out of 5. It's $3.99. Even in Hawaii where there seems to be an automatic $5-30 price increase on most Lego sets when compared to the mainland. Well worth buying at least one.

"thewish","2009-12-21T06:14:37.937Z","Best freebie I've had. LEGO, we worship you!","The V-19 Torrent is the Repoublic Starfighter mainly used in the Clone Wars. The mini version of this came with a Mirror promotion and was virtually free. The set is very realistic for a mini set with folding wings and weaponry.

PROS-
Very realistic
Cheap
Folding wings
Great pieces

CONS-
None

You won't regret buying this on Ebay for a higher price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legomikos","2011-02-17T15:31:52.413Z","Good design in Mini-scale","<p>The V-19 Torrent Starfighter was used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. It had two blaster cannons and two concussion missile launchers. Its speed and maneuverability were exceptional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set comes inside a small polybag:</p>

<p>These are the pieces of the set:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building of the ship is very short. Firstly, we build the main body, and then add the engines and a small Technic structure, which serves as a landing gear and to build de central wing. We also build the cockpit</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, we build and add the center wing:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we build the two lateral wings. The left wing has a white round tile 2x2 with the Republic's symbol.</p>
