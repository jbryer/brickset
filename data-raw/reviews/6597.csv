"dragon_teenager","2008-08-05T00:39:22.297Z","First to review this amazing set!","The Ultra-Drill Walker is easily the best set this year. Rather than boring you with a drawn-out review, though, I'll keep things simple with a pro/con list.

 PROS :

- The walker is huge and very impressive to display.

- The Astro minifigures have backpacks now, which makes them look much better. 

- The construction is breathtaking. I've never seen a set weave together so seamlessly.

- All of the functions work very well. 

- The build is extremely satisfying... probably the most satisfying build I've ever experienced. 

- The mini-ship is actually one of the best human ships ever. Extremely swooshable. 

- The alien ship is a remarkable improvement over the shameful alien vehicles seen last year. 

- Same goes for the alien commander... still not great though.

- The mini-scooter is AWESOME.

- The sticker sheet lends some awesome detail... this is one of the few sets that I liked enough to even bother with stickers, and that's saying something. Decals are amazing.

- The drill looks great.

- A water tank is mounted on the back. Neat detail.

- Extremely sturdy. Nothing falls off. 

- Great pieces. 

- Airtight cockpit.

 CONS :

- Needs one more astro minifig. 

- The legs can't walk very well. Technically they CAN, but it's more trouble than it's worth. 


As you can see, the pros FAR outweigh the cons. I've never been more satisfied with a LEGO set. Buy it now, and don't get ripped off by those overpriced Clone Wars sets!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rgijaba","2008-12-01T19:21:38.543Z","One of the best Mars Mission sets yet!","That includes the not-released &quot;sets&quot; in CrystAlien Conflict.This LEGO master peice is the 2008 equivialant of the MT-101 Crystal Miner.This one is much better looking. With four legs that move (with some manual labor), an awesome super laser drill, and Astros (Trike Diver and Mission Commander)wearing back packs for the first time, I'd say it is well worth the $80 or so this set cost!The cocpit also comes off into a little ship (or mini-building, like in CrystAlien Conflict) very fast and eifficantly.The drill spins, too. I also had a good time building this and applying its stickers. Why do most people hat those? It is very impressive among your other LEGO Mars Mission sets, because, as I already said, it's the best one!

But I wonder why Trike Driver and Mission Commander/Infantry have back packs?I know it looks a little better, but why? Now it's harder to get them to stand up on non-stided surfaces!I almost forgot about the Alien ship! It has a new Alien Commander and the also new shiny metal-ish colored sticker that changes colors depending on the lighting and yor veiw. So that's good, too.

Having no more to say, this is a good one that you should get... probably.

"cassidyarch","2009-04-16T23:28:43.093Z","My Favorite Martian!","This is easily the best set of the Mars Mission line. I have the other two large MM vehicles (Hypersonic Operations Aircraft, and the Armored Drilling Unit), and they both rely on a large Technic framework to bulk them out and make them look bigger. This one has none of that, it's solid brickwork top to bottom. 

Great pieces, backpacks for the astronauts, and the final model looks fantastic!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-01-11T12:13:21.983Z","its huge!","As i said in the title, this set is huge. It is the largest set i have ever built by far, and i had it totgerher in 3 hours.

Pros:
HUGE drill walker
Very sturdy
destacible ship to battle alien ship
huge laser drill
fun and easy to build
alien ship is great
alien commanders are always awesome

cons:
Needs another astro to work the hover mini ship
alien was way too easy to build
building the legs of the drill walker was quite a task, each one is like 50 pieces and you have to do it four times!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cameljockie","2009-07-28T16:32:51.78Z","Sheer perfection","When I saw the first pictures of this on the internet my jaw almost hit the ground. This thing is by far the best vehicle of the mars mission series and is one of the best space themed sets Ive seen in a decade. 

First off the 'pitbull' logo on the side really sums this machine up. it is out there to get what it wants and will attack to defend itself; The cockpit section slides out to reveal a shuttle like vehicle. Ingeniously, there is a little scout/personal transport vehicle tucked away inside that!

The space miners come with there own back pack in this one for a bit of added realism I think. The alien and his ship arent much to blert on about but its nicely sized for once; in other sets the alen ships tended to be much larger and overwhelming. I think the miners vehicles are really what people are buying them for not for green jelly aliens!

The Drill piece really is what makes set so clever; once the shuttle is detached you can arch down the drill from its cruising horizontal position to the vertical position, yet keeping the control section pivoted level. Once you've done that just turn the dial and the drill spins away!

Seriously, Ive NEVER seen a design this perfected before. Well, not since the space themes of the 90s has this one set alone set a new standard in space vehicle design. Its a shame the same cannot be said about other models in the series. 

So here it goes:

Pros:
- Resonable price for a 'Hard to find'.
- Fantastic design and well thoughtout functions.
- Drill piece is like no other!
- Back packs for the 2 miners. Finally!
- The shuttle and the mini-shuttle.
- 2 in 1 vehicles concept is spot on.
- Brilliant display piece
- Only a few stickers.

Cons
- Pathetic little alien craft.

So from what could have been a joke for the Mars mission series, this model really is the show piece of the entire line. Even if you dont like the Mars mission concept you'll turn your head once you've built this beauty!

"Cervelet","2009-10-17T10:05:35.81Z","6 out of 5 points. It's that good.","I got this baby today, when I saw it for sale in a small toy store. And oh boy, is it awesome.
This model transcends the conception of lego building to a religious experience through the sheer awesomness of it. Not only is the design fabulous, but the construction is one of the best I've witnessed.
It begins with a small and very-well designed alien spacecraft, which through his curves, slopes and colors makes you immediately think of alien. Very good, but completely overshadowed what follows.
It's then a marathon of gentle curves, small details, nearly studlessness. The few lego tachnic elements are only used to ensure the model stands under the weight of its own awesomness. It's entirely based on the rule of cool. Everything cool-looking was thrown in, and yet with such mastery that it is, in fact, perfection. 
The middle part makes a fantastic rocket by itself: then comes the ""laser drill"" and the ""water tank"", both of wich are there just to make sure every doubt about its awesomness vanish. An intelligent system hold the laser up when the rocket is logged in: pull the rocket out, and you can pull the laser down. Simple, yet very effective and sturdy. Also, and if it wasn't enough, you can pull out a small yet well-designed rocket out of the main rocket. 
It then occurs to you that although this part is already freaking big, you still got the legs, and those make the middle part look small on the box. The build is the same for all four legs, luckily they are beautifully crafted so that building the same 4 times don't become repetitive at all. They even feature small rubber grips under the feet.
The end result is amazing. It's huge and incredibly awesome. 
Although the pieces are great, with enough slopes to make a studless battleship, you can't destroy it. It's too good. Too beautifull.
This model should be considered a classic in my opinion: perfect build, good price, godly beautifull design and exellent playability. Unfortunately, it being limited edition, internet only (at last here.. for a while) and part of a short-lived theme might leave it into the pit of forgotness, although I hope it will not.
Oh, and did I mention it was awesome? because it is.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BigMac","2009-11-18T03:54:35.06Z","A good Model For Display.","
If you love Lego, this is one of the must have set. 

I am a Technic fan, not much interested in Mars series, however I still have 3 
big sets of Mars Mission, as I am a real Lego lover also. I bought this in May. just put on the self and almost forgot it. Early November, I read the comment on Brickset about this set, and increditably, I found this one get ALL 5. I took it out and complete all the work in four hours, a bit slow but I never rush as I always enjoy the process of building Lego.

- It is very beautiful, and good for display.

- The drill functioning perfectly, and can be tilted to a horizintal position  being used  as a laser cannon / gun.

- The detachable space shuttle was well designed to fit into the Drill Platform, and the removable space bike in the shuttle is really cute.

- The drill can be easily motorised, which enhances the function to a great extent.

Too much to be mentioned here, get one from ebay,  you will understand why this one up to now get ALL 5

"james3426","2009-10-25T20:23:27.03Z","Plain Awesomeness.","This is even better than the Hypersonic Spacecraft. it can separate into three parts, (The shuttle is awesome!) the blunt launcher is move-able, the alien ship is cool, and it has drill that can really spin! The actual design is very complex and challenging. The shuttle is mostly what I am talking about when I say that. The interesting pieces are: the trans-blue and silver Bohrok teeth, the gears, the tubes, and the tank halves in the back.

pros:
Awesome shuttle.
Three in one. (The main part, the shuttle and crystal collector, and the Alien ship.)
Move-able blunt launcher.
Intersting pieces.
Spinning drill.
Can combine to make an awesome walker.

cons:
NONE!

An awesome vehicle. Get this if you have the chance.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Johnnyred","2010-05-15T00:53:34.98Z","Time to get the job done.","<p>The Mt-201 Drill Walker is definitely one of the best sets in the Mars Mission series.&nbsp; It has a good size, it's a good, long build, it has a fair amount of minifigs, and it also has a good sized ETX Fighter.&nbsp; Well now, let's get on with the review.</p>
<p>The Drill Walker - It's big, it's bad, and it has a LOT of decals!&nbsp; The main part of this set, the Drill Walker is an amazing set, one that truely shines out among some of LEGOs more recent sets, it's four legs move indepentantly (However, they do not move at the knees, which would be very nice.&nbsp; But, use some spare bricks and I'm sure you can mod it fairly easily.)&nbsp; As I said, there are tons of decals instead of printed bricks.&nbsp; There were plenty of opportunities for printed bricks in this set, but LEGO didn't take any of them.&nbsp; (Well, except for a computer screen)&nbsp; The drill is awesome, and has a good amount of detailing, however, it would be nice if it could move up and not just down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Shuttle - The apparent cockpit of this titan also doubles as a shuttle (Which greatly resembles the Galileao&nbsp;VII from Star Trek TOS).&nbsp; It has a nice canopy, and a good amount of more regular bricks and not just slopes (Though there is quite a few still).&nbsp; It also has a &quot;Luggage Rack&quot; on the top which can hold storage containers that hold energy crystals.&nbsp; It also has a small hanger for a little mini-scooter thing, which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Craft - It's tiny, it's fast, and it's got a hand laser!&nbsp; That's right, this is one of the few sets that has a hand laser in it.&nbsp; There's not much else to say about this little craft except that it is unique, and it's a nice addition to the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Alien Fighter - It's a fair craft, but it's not the best&nbsp;that LEGO has made.&nbsp; But at least they included an enemy vessel in this set.&nbsp; It's got a fair amount of pieces, it's pretty sturdy, and it's also fairly sturdy.&nbsp; Not really much else to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigs - Nothing much to say really.&nbsp; It would be nice if they had thrown in at least one more Astro though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is an excellent set, 5 stars in every category.&nbsp; If you have the chance to get this set, then go for it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Doctor_Leg_O_Brick","2010-08-28T04:18:05.707Z","how much!!","<p>Well, as my title says, its £60 now, and as always&nbsp;I got it on sale at B&amp;M bargins. Your thinking ""what is&nbsp;B&amp;M bargins?"" or ""why go their!."". Their a shop that gets big brands (like lego) for cheaper than the RRP.</p>
<p><B>THE BUILD</B> - It takes about 50 to 60 minutes, making it a very long but fun build.</p>
<p><B>THE PARTS</B> - Well, whats to say? The number&nbsp;of curved or slanted parts you get is amazing. Great use of technic parts for the drill, and the drill is well made and was not a wast of time.&nbsp;I love the shuttle, as well as the bike in the back.&nbsp;The gun in this set was so good,&nbsp;lego used it for space police 3. And well, the parts used for the alien space ship&nbsp;are good, not as good as the other half.</p>
<p><B>THE PLAYABILITY</B> - Great.&nbsp;On its own its still good, mostly because theirs an alien space ship to blow up. And yes,&nbsp;I love the spring missle. Having an ""3 in one"" is good, without it, i'd have marked it down.</p>
<p><B>THE MINIFIGURES</B> - This time you get an alien commander, and two very cool space men. One has a city/castle face, the other having a face mask in some racing sets. The only problem being the commander as sideway hands, so he can not hold a blaster the right way up.</p>
<p><B>THE MONEY</B> - As&nbsp;i said in the title, how much??&nbsp;Well as i said i got it for only £29.99. Saving me about £30/£40.&nbsp;If you find it like me on sale, buy it.</p>
<p><B>THE OVERALL RATING</B> - You got to give it a five bricks out of five bricks.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,3
"Blockland","2013-07-06T17:57:16.903Z","Perfect","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember back when I got this set, and on how it was so much fun to play with. Fast forward 5 years, and I still love the set. I remember getting it from Toys R Us for my birthday, opening it, building it, and loving it. I guess it is time to review the set. The box was very nice, big, and detailed. Opening the set, it was in numbered bags I believe. I first built the Minifigures. The miners are very detailed and have a nice head piece. The Alien Commander and his ship is also a nice touch. Then, I built the whole mining platform. The legs are built very good, as they are sturdy and can support the body. The Cockpit is also nice, able to store a speeder and some crystals. It's just not the best for flight though. The drill is built almost perfect, having a lot of detail with it. The only thing is, I swear I have seen this before....</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Very nice Minifigures</li><li>Sturdy</li><li>A lot of interesting parts</li><li>The speeder is a nice touch, along with the alien jet</li><li>Cool water tank on the back</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Somewhat pricey</li><li>Another Minifigure would be nice</li><li>The design is heavily based on a Scarab from Halo</li></ul>
<p>Despite the minor flaws, this is a must have set for Space collectors.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
