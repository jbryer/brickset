Got on offer from toys R Us (UK) for Â£29.99  which came with a bonus lego basic bricks (item 5576) so was a good buy.

Pros:
*With the Extra bricks it had alot of brick (tho basic types)
*Good minifig acessories (drill spanner etc)
*Minifig (ok)
*Wheels and clear glass windscreens
*An array of colours including orange and slime green
*A door and 2 windows
*fences, plants, coloured studs

Cons:
*green base plates too small they could have given bigger ones to make a house or something

Was a good re-introduction set to lego for me as i hadnt had lego scince i was young.

Not worth full price without free extra bricks tho

The price for&nbsp;the bundle&nbsp;was app. 50 Euro which is quite high.&nbsp;The set has lots of tiles but only one minifig.&nbsp;Furthermore most of the bricks are big ones (2x) which are of little use. The biggest problem IMHO is the lack of&nbsp;a building manual. You are left with no instructions at all and have to rely only on your fantasy.</p>
<p>This set is nice as an add-on to your LEGO collection, but of little use if you have no&nbsp;other sets to combine with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRO: lots of bricks, big nice box which can hold many many tiles</p>
<p>CON: too expensive, only one minifig, many big bricks, no biulding instructions.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,2,3
