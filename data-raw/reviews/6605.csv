"Smallsam99","2008-06-07T12:35:35.153Z","Awesome Game!","When I first heard about this game I waited and when it first came out I bought it. the game is a lot different than lego star wars and in my opinion a little better. YOu pick up items,harder in difficulty, and will make you want to keep playing. The artifacts are a cool twist on the vechiles and unlock secret levels. The game overall is a long game and worth it. I rate it a 10/10 and highy reccomend it to any lego video game player.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"indykid","2008-08-06T00:32:41.187Z","WOW!","This game is way more fun than LEGO star wars(then again im more of an indy fan than star wars). I've gotten 74% so far and I almost have all the parcels unlocked but not bought. I have also unlocked a secret level. There are three secret levels that you unlock with artifacts. the only downside is that on the trouble in the sky level on my game it freezes when you jump into the third flock of seagulls. The Young Indy level is really fun and you can buy Fedora after you play it! Its better than lego star wars because you just need to play every level, then one secret level, then find  C-3PO, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, and R2-D2 and all of the player s in the library are unlocked!. Its cool that there isn't just fighting the entire game, instead you get to solve puzzles and find secrets! I also like the fact that you can customize characters. I'm a bit down about there not being any Kingdom Of the Crystal Skull levels but LEGO started making the game before they knew the movie was coming out so its ok. But overall this game gets a 6/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Anyways, this game is loads of fun that anyone of any age can enjoy. Let me just elaborate on the title a little bit with a further explanation. You see, when I first got this game, I got it for the PC of course and absolutely hated it, but I tried to appreciate it for the decent game that it is. Now, finally, I actually can! This game is awsome. You can pick up items like guns and bottles, play as all the cool indy characters, solve even more puzzling challenges, collect treasure chests instead of minikits, send your mix and match characters for a test run in barnett college, and there are even new types of characters that you can be such as shovel people, wrench people, and book nerds. Also, three bonus rounds, young indy, ancient city, and warehouse, are included. Plus, if you locate five star wars characters within five different rounds throughout the game you can unlock han solo for play. And the best part of all, NO DARK SPOTS, as were present in the PC version. Anyways, without a doubt this game is fantastic, and I look forward to the new one coming out soon. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"NickBrick","2011-02-14T18:39:31.933Z","Don't be suckered into this game like I was.","<p>How in the world are these licensed&nbsp; Lego games getting such good review? I gave it a fair chance, but I'm afraid that I'm still going to give it a hard time do to some inappropriate content and some repetitive gameplay. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gameplay. If you've played a Lego game before such as Lego Batman or the well known <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lego Star Wars, the gameplay will be nearly identical. You run around in a contained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; environment solving puzzles, beating up and shooting enemies, and driving a vehicle <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or two. While Indy has some cool(and often funny) moves such as killing a guy by <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; giving him a nuggie. The game suffers from being too similar to the other Lego games.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Graphics. While they can sometimes feel rather bright and jagged the graphics are indeed&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a step up from the disastrous Lego star wars: the complete saga. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; Starting now I'm am going to include a section about how appropriate these Lego games<br />
&nbsp; are. As I have found some to have rather objectionable content in some video games I <br />
&nbsp; have bought. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Violence. At a glance its nothing, you punch a German and&nbsp; he falls to pieces. however <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; when I got to the Cairo level things got a little bit much. As I was chopping up some<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; some Egyptians with a sword and saw their heads rolling in the dust I must say I felt a <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lot like a cold-blooded murderer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romantic content. Uhhgg! do we have to have this kind of stuff in a Lego game? I'm <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not going to get in much detail about Indy's girlfriends, however some of them are &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; dressed poorly and it is possible to use Indy's whip to pull them to him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and...Uhh I'm just gonna not say what he does.(shudder)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall. This is not the game you want. if you're looking for a good Wii game consider<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; picking up Sonic Colors, Super smash bros brawl, or Wii sports resort. Hope I was <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; helpful.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-05T18:24:51.01Z","Classic LEGO Video Game Fun for Everyone","<p><strong>LEGO Indiana Jones The Original Adventures:</strong> Reviewing LEGO Video Games is something that many ignore. Brickset features most games in the database for many systems. The Force Awakens is still conspicuous by its absence, however we&rsquo;re here to discuss some of the older titles that I have yet to express an opinion on.</p>

<p>You came to see the review for the Wii version of the LEGO Indiana Jones video game which was one of the earliest titles Traveler&rsquo;s Tales brought out after the success of LEGO Star Wars. So let&rsquo;s move on to the LEGO Game Review.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>Being one of the earliest titles in the Traveler&rsquo;s Tales iconography this is relatively lackluster compared to the progress that has been made since. The Hub World is quite small, the contents limited to levels only with one or two bonus levels and not much to do. There is also no dialogue lifted from the films, it&rsquo;s pantomime only. That does not mean the game is terrible or not worth enjoying, it simply means that if you&rsquo;re coming to this one after playing some of the more recent titles you may feel it is too simple and easy to play through as the puzzles are not as diverse as they have come to be and the levels are much shorter.</p>

<p><strong>Game Play</strong></p>

<p>Being one of the oldest titles to exist there are definite flaws. While the game is enjoyable there are the usual game breaking glitches which can occur inherent in the programming of the time. Collecting everything is simple and straight forward as well, and the diverse set of characters isn&rsquo;t as varied as LEGO Star Wars or LEGO Batman.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones has a brilliant level of detail in it and the story unfolds quite nicely. The game plays perfectly or near perfectly. Honestly since there are so few features to go over here there isn&rsquo;t much to discuss. The game is enjoyable if brief and aside from potential defects such as levels freezing on you and the annoying high pitched whine is definitely there, so you have to be willing to look past these things while playing through the game. The Wii version does not rely too much on motion controls compared to the LEGO Star Wars titles.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>If you never picked up this title I would suggest it might be worth a rental if such facilities still exist in your area of the world. Getting it second hand for a good price is also worthwhile, however if you prefer the more engrossing titles of the more recent iterations I would strongly suggest that you can skip this game.</p>
