It has alot of the same characteristics and other things but they did add alot of other things.  Such as swimming, digging, and others!

"Tri_pod_king","2008-07-23T14:26:31.967Z","Much better than Lego Star Wars!","I got this on the first day of summer vacation and I'll tell ya', it's a blast! I was worried that it'd be like Lego Star Wars, but it turned out it was a lot different. Although I must admit that you have to have seen the movies to know what to do. What I also liked about it is that when to people are playing it, they'll both probably want to play as Indiana Jones, so they might have an argument on who gets to be Indy. Well, not with this game. There are 9 different Indy's! And sure, $39.99 is a lot, but it's worth it! Although I'd still wait for the price to drop.

It is better than LEGO Star Wars, but harder.

Good:
Indy!
Raiders of the Lost Ark
Temple of Doom
Last Crusade
So many characters!
So many secrets! (Like _________ Characters, NO SPOILERS!)
So many different outfits!
Character Creator
Artifacts instead of Canisters/Minikits
Secret Stud-Filled Levels (Like Ancient City)

Bad:
No Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Levels (you can't blame them because it came out not a month after the movie)
Harder

Overall:
4.7/5
OR
8.7/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
