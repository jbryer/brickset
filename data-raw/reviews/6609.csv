","Well, I just recently became a lego indy fan coincidently just in time for the release of the game, and I must say that I am quite impressed. The game really captures the adventure, fun, and humor of the classic indy movies. Here's an extensive list of pros and a not so extensive list of cons to better reveal the goods and the bads of this game: 

Pros: 
-rounds are longer and more challenging 
-you get more characters with different abilities 
-new and cooler extras 
-extras and characters are cheaper making them easier to attain 
-you only need to get true adventurer once 
-true adventurer actually gives you studs 
-clips are funnier than ever 
-includes bonus rounds like young indy and ancient city 
-you can mix and match characters with new pieces 
-you start out at barnett college with many more rooms to explore 
-rare and valuable purple studs are actually placed into rounds  
-includes some things from lego star wars 2 

Cons: 
-when characters hit the wall they shimmy very slowly 
-in some rounds the lights go out without any way of turning them on permanently 

Now, the fact that the lights go out is a biggie because it's the reason why I didn't give this a 5/5. I mean, it's not even challenging, it's difficult. Anyways, faults aside, I think that this game is really good. I look forward to seeing more lego games being made in the future. I certainly hope that they'll be as good as this one.

This game is filled with adventure and excitement. As you Indiana Jones and a friend (if you want to) go through the three original Indy movies.  As you encounter enemies, danger, and surprises and try to retrieve the Ark, the special stones, and the Grail.

Pros:

- 60 playable charaters
- each charater has a special jump or special ability or fight move(s)
- secret worlds and abilities
- can watch movies seen in adentures (doesn't sound like much but it is really cool)
- artifacts to find for extra fun
- can make your own charaters

Cons:

- boys can't hurt girls but, girls CAN hurt boys
- if the two charaters walk in two diferent directions one of them poofs too  another places
- it can take a long time to get the second player in motion
- after you go to the menu screen in an adventure it takes them a long time to get your charaters moving again and all the enemies still move

Overall, it is a great game filled with lots of Lego humor that will make you laugh. I give it a 4/5. hope this review helps.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The controls aren't very good, and you HAVE to use the keyboard or the xbox360 wireless controller! It wasn't worth the $10 I got it for! I wish LEGO would lay off the computer versions of their games.<br>",FALSE,1,1,1,1,1
