"lego12","2008-06-13T12:57:43.093Z","Get him! He's getting away! Hop on the ship and let's go!","  This set is perfectly fine. There is NOTHING wrong with this set. It wasn't expensive and it has rockets on the sides of the ship.  It has a rare minifigure with a really cool shirt, pants and a cool looking helmet.  It looks like a hovercraft as the other reviewer has said.  I hope you enjoyed my review and I hope it helped to make you decide whether or not to get this set!

Pros: Good controllers, weapons different from most of the space police ships (instead of the orange sticks, this has missles) and a good minifig

Cons: although this could apply to any of the SPII sets, what happens to the ship when it has fired both missles and has nothing left in a dogfight?

"krysto2002","2008-07-25T08:16:12.687Z","Cool hovercraft","This is a pretty cool set, though hard to find now due to the rockets, it is still a really cool miniset. The set has one figure, and a hovercraft, but the loss of the point goes to the fact that the set is missing an accessory, even a loudhailer would do. I'm not sure but I think this is part of a value pack, if so, it is a 5/5, but on its own, lacks the 5 point quality. The hovercraft gets a 5/5 in my book, since it has an emblem, plenty of parts, is fueled by a little more than imagination (thus the boosters) and looks to have a decent weapons system. An A+ model, but needs a radio or megaphone and a clip to hold them.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"James83","2017-08-17T13:32:57.27Z","Space Police Car","<p>Another of the pocket money rocket ships that made up the much of the space fleets but it looks good and provides plenty of fun.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This small spacecraft is a very quick build and is fairly simplistic but the bricks used for the nose and wings look good, as does the red and grey colour scheme.&nbsp;The controls are two stick antennas with&nbsp;is a vent brick behind. There is no seat for the pilot but you do get a nice Space Police printed brick. The circular 2x2 brick used as a nose landing pad is a nice touch. The two rockets (or are they missiles?) are attached by robot arm bricks and can be moved up and down but they are fragile and come off easily.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A standard Space Police 2&nbsp;minifigure with airtanks. The head was one of the first printed faces in the Space theme and features a radio headset and brown eyebrows.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>This nippy craft is perfect for chasing Blacktrons but the pilot is a little exposed and it can be fragile during high-speed manual flying. I soon broke this up to build a bigger craft and this set contains several useful bricks for using in your own designs.&nbsp;</p>
