It is a spiritual sequel to the LSW series, with gameplay virtually identical. One change is the ability to pick up items. Although most characters come with a default item much like the LGS characters each had their weapon, all characters can find and use items such as guns, swords, and shovels scattered throughout levels or stolen from defeated enemies. 

Many other changes in the game come from the shift from the sci-fi Star Wars to a 1930's based Indiana Jones. There are no more droids, light sabers, and laser guns. A lot of the fighting is just punching, whacking with shovels, or hitting with wrenches. Bounty hunter doors have been replaced with statues activitated by Thuggees. Instead of grappling hooks, Indy swings between platforms with his whip.

Most acheivable things from LSW have recieved an Indy makeover. Mini-kits are now artifacts, red blocks are now deliverable mail, and True Jeid is now True Adventurer. There are two major changes with this though: (1) there are no longer gold bricks, and (2) you only have to achieve True Adventurer once per level, in either story or free mode. Also, personally I've found achieving True Adventurer much easier.

For most of the game there are arrows and highlights that give you guidance on what to do. Although at times this can seem to insultingly hold your hand, it leaves you at a loss when the hints suddenly drop away. Although a lot of the game is the challenge of the various puzzles, it can get extremely frustrating to be locked in a room for 15 minutes continuously searching for the next step.

Also, as in the movies, the character Willie is useless. At first her screaming ability to break glass is funny, but it gets dull quickly and is only used about two times while playing through the story. In free play, you can blast glass open with a grenade-wielder or bazooka trooper. Although she also has the useful trait of high jumping like other women in the game, she could have used a useful item rather than this gag of a trait.

Some other parts I found entertaining were the use of Short Round for the vents and jumping into and walking around in bushes. It reminded me of the scene from the underrated movie &quot;The Stupids&quot; where Stanley is Man-Bush, nature's greatest wonder.

Overall, this is game is a ton of fun. Any Lego or Indiana Jones will love the combination of fighting bad guys, solving logic puzzles, and chuckle-inducing cut scenes.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

In fact, I love 'these guys' This game is fabulous- with a family-friendly set up (unlimited lives!) and one or two players, this is a great game to play with a friend, (Although, it needs to be someone you can work with, or else it can get pretty stressful.) and there are lots of co-op opprotunities.
    It includes many of the major scenes and parts from the first three movies - my favorite being Motorcycle Escape - and many great ways to get through them. (I find the super scream rather hilarious.) 
    There is one problem with this game, and all LEGO games, though, and that's that it kind of loses it's fun once you finish every level, extra, and secret in the game. 
    If you like Indiana Jones and LEGO - which I hope you do - then get this game!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
