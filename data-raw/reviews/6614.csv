It comes with a Lego space minifig, firefighter, Octan minifig, prisoner, and the mad scientist from that Studios set. If you never had any of these, it is also even better. Lego should make alot more of these.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It's hard to see re-releases of old themes, pieces and minifigures now. I'm not a big fan of re-releases, but I'm a huge fan of older sets. This as example, is a very good selection of classic minifigures (Although I would like very much if they could at least release more classic castle minifigs, such as Dragon Masters), includes three itens for Town/City (a fireman, a prisioner and another minifigure with the Octan logo on it's body). 

And also the rare ""Mad Scientist"" minifigure from Lego Studios. About the Classic Space minifigure (one of my favorites), it is classic. But not so classic. First, because the helmet piece is not the original from the original minifigure. It fits a visor, while the oldest Space helmet couldn't do that. The main reason for that ""flaw"" is because the molds of that helmet can't be adquired anymore by TLG (it's too old). Another difference in that minifigure is the Classic Space logo, that is centralized in the body, not like it was in the first bodies, but it's nothing that can interfers much.

So, it's not a Vintage at all. Vintage would be a true re-release of the true and original minifigures, instead of some minifigures that looks like the original ones. Of course, it's not something to complain about the set, but really, if you want the original Classic Space Minifigure, you will not find by this (or by the 2nd vintage collection), but if you want the others, this is maybe one of your best choices.

Although those few mistakes around one minifigure, it is a good set. But like some current packs (not SW's, but like the Castle Battle Packs), it is overpriced by it's content. Those are not ""just five minifigures"", but really, five minifigures don't worth USD$17,99. What is maybe the reason for that price, is the pack. It's really good, but don't necessary. One pack like Castle Battle packs' would preserve the content as well, and maybe the set could cost at least five dollar less.

So, I don't recommend this set if you want those minifigures. Bricklink or other ways (like Ebay) will have those, so you need to analyse what offer worth. And also you can buy them with their original sets (instead of only them). This is really a good idea for re-release, but don't worth at all and also it's not a Vintage actually. I would really like a set like this, but less expensive. Sadly it's a 3, for the price.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legowasta","2009-07-30T08:03:21.093Z","Crappy reissues?!","I bought this set/collexction, but was very disappointed to see a space minifig that did not resemble the original from the 80's. I don't think the so called 're-issues' are a good thing. Why not make them original and more expensive if necessary? I will not buy the other volumes and probably give this one away.

Pros: RED ASTRONAUT, fire man, scientist with double head, prisoner, gas station worker

Cons: The vintage figs are WAY overpriced",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
