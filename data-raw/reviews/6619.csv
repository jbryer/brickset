Batman is my favorite DC Superhero and I love LEGO so this was an awesome gift. I have the black suit Batman as well and this looks just as good. The LEGO plate is a great touch, too bad they didn't add another plate with the Batman logo! His suit is quite detailed and the fig is a great LEGO-ization of Batsy. As the great Jack Nicholson said in 1989's &quot;Batman&quot; movie...&quot;Those toys! Where does he get those wonderful toys?&quot; Why, at the LEGO Store of course!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
