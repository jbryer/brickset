"Novelty","2007-04-29T13:34:51.933Z","Cat got your pault","1993 seems to be the year with small sets that are badly thought of and implemented and this is no exception.  The stand is huge, which does not really make sense and the catapault design is basic.  It has no embelishments which makes it look visually unappealing - there isn't even a flag.  Add that to the fact that the catapault doesn't even throw the bricks very far and this set really is almost as bad as X-men3 was.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-09-14T00:35:57.42Z","Heads!","This was my first set I had where the book was so small, like quarter of a normal book. As a kid this one one of my favourite sets. Mainly due to the axe. I thought it was the best. Even now I still think it's pretty good.

The model itself is obviously a ground mounted catapult. It comes with with two grey 1x1 blocks to fire, but more ammo is easily acquired. The catapult is sturdy and I can make it fly about three meters but over a short distance it is more accurate. Comes with a knights sword and cool battle axe which clip on the side. The only bit I didn't like was the base plate is made from two 2x8 flat plates. Why not just give us an actual plate?

The mini-fig looks good too with chest armour printed on, facial hair and a cool helmet. Also he can hold the ammo quite well which looks good on display.

Overall I feel it is a good little set and adds alot to any Castle collection. I think a 6/10 is appropriate here and would recommend this set to anyone. Also I live in Australia and we got it here so it's not US only.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-09T12:37:34.39Z","Bad defence","The catapult works nicely, but you cannot aim at the enemies when they are coming from another direction. You can only throw ammunition straight ahead. The catapult is fixed in its place. The soldier comes with two weapons, which is good, but he doesn't have a shield, which is bad. But still: it's a nice little set. 

By the way, it wasn't available in the US only. I bought it in Austria, where I live. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-07-31T15:18:21.483Z","Another king's catapult","This set was released in 1993, altough this is described as US only, this could be reached on another countries. This set looks like something with the other King's catapult, like the details of the chainmail on the torso of the minifigure. One difference is that this set is described as part of the black knights, and the other, considered as crusader set. But those factions from older castles were very compatible with nice designs of true knights and true lego minifigures, useful due to the yellow face with details.

Of course have things to say about, this is simple but have useful things, what makes this great as a small set. The pieces on this can be used on bigger catapults and to castles, altough how few the contents are. The base of the set are two 2x8 green plates. On those, are placed two slope bricks, compatible to the 2x2 bricks above. The other pieces above those are two black ones, but only one have the pin to put on the main part of the catapult, made by one brick with a hole on it (wich was used on technic and many times on system). The catapult's main plate is black and is compatible with the &quot;Excavator bucket&quot;, where are the bricks can be launched, easily. Another additions of the set are the 1x1 plates that can hangs a axe, and the sword, being well putted don't touching much the slope bricks under. The upper piece is one that is very common in castle and keeps the position of the catapult.

After the building of it, the playability is what can have from a catapult and a small set, launching the bricks (1x1 ones), if well positioned, this can go far, not much and not few, so is better analyse the position of the main plate and of the moveable &quot;excavator bucket&quot; before throw it or before say that it don't launchs far. The system of this catapult is similar to the set &quot;Dragon Defender&quot;(6043), but this is very small, altough fits well to a small set. So, the playability is the same of small sets. 

When it was released, this wasn't expensive like now. It is near of $9,99 on Bricklink, but have another prices on this, that are hard to worth. But, altough if it is pricey now, this should be compared as when it was released. If you have the pieces to do that, this could be a good stuff to add on castle, through websites, the instructions of this set can be reached. I have pratically how make this set, I only can't make some details and use the same minifig. But still, if it don't have flag and these things, it don't matter, the useful things there are very appealing, and the design is great, simple but creative. That it is basic I know, the reason is it's size, and it's idea, small altough useful. Useful to add, or to use, maybe to improve your castle, altough it looks like huge on the plate, there have a space to the minifigure fits. Now it could be hard to find in ways that worth, but if you have instructions and pieces, this is a nice model to do. And about throw easily, also young childrens can keeps this in great positions to throw bricks or keep those on the catapult without them falling of this.

Overall it is good as a small set, I don't judge this by the price that now don't worth, but to contents and ideas. This needs to grow in the rank, of course is not the better option like great and big sets from the same black knights theme, so it gets a rate close to five, 4,6 or 4,7, if with the comparison that it needs.
Great small set! :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-10-26T14:01:54.973Z","Yay.... another catapult....","<p>The only saving grace to this set is that it's small and for an impulse buy, therefore easy to buy and pick up without realizing later that did you really want this set?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I say that coming from the perspective of someone who's realized as the years have gone by, there are several different variations of catapults that lego has done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The catapult itself is stationary, it doesn't move, doesn't even rotate for a different angle. There's a minifigure of indiscriminate army orientation, so you can put him where you want him to go. Sword and battle axe. And that's really about it.</p>",TRUE,2,3,2,3,4
