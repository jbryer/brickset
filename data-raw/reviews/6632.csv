I also had them engraved with our names and wedding date because we were at Disney World celebrating our 7th anniversary. I had them engraved and they were ready about 45 minutes later. You can select the color brick, the color dye used for the engraving, the font and of course what you want on the brick! This is such an awesome idea that I couldn't pass it up. The brick's color is similar to the light blue that was one of our wedding colors so this brick really was the perfect brick for us to have engraved and they are still on our key chains. The brick's sharp corners have been smoothing out, somewhat rounding off so don't expect the brick to remain perfect but it is still an awesome idea. I also have a wizard minifig key chain but one of his leg's fell off so these are like any key chains in that they will deteriorate somewhat over time and countless times being dropped, taking out of your pocket, etc.

I am so glad that I bought this and it is a constant reminder of my anniversary and trips to the LEGO Store in Florida! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
