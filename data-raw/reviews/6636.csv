With this you can make &quot;frozen minifigures&quot;, putting water or a juice in the mould of the minifigures and after, put the mould in the refrigerator. 

Maybe in a day (or less), you can get the frozen minifigure and eat it. The set at all have a good quality, also about the lollipop. It isn't very useful, but if you want to make your dessert a bit more Lego style, get this.

But I don't recommend it to the Lego fans who wish to get more sets, because it looks like to be unuseful, don't worth very much by US$12.99. So, this set have a good idea and a decent execution (the price and utility aren't that good). So, it still with a 3,8 out of 5 for a good idea and quality.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
