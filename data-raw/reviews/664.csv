"YellowedWhitePieces","2008-04-27T17:44:21.45Z","Still built after all these years.","I received this set years ago, brand-new and judging from the lack of teeth marks on the the pieces, I only built this set once.  I certainly don't remember building it more than once; it's been sitting on my book shelf for the last 20+ years, just as it was when I built it the first and presumably only time.  I distinctly recall leaving off the black 1X2 plate at the rear of the seat (and the smooth 1X2 that topped it) because it seemed the the bike was somehow sleeker without it.  Those two pieces are the only ones missing and if I ever find them in my stored box of old Lego pieces, I will put them back on.  

The bike has a working kickstand and of course the front forks turn from side to side.  The wheels are slightly offset to the side, as constructed, and one side of each tire is open.  So, the bike looks best from its left side, as built.  Shocks would have been nice--they could have certainly been originally included without changing the rest of the design and can be easily added today.

Time has yellowed the gray elements and some of the smaller parts have developed cracks, specifically the wheel mounts at the end of the front forks.  They are almost completely split in half now.  The tires are in great shape, however.  The red, black and yellow elements have aged well and they are all in fine shape.

I don't really remember playing with it very much and aside from the kickstand pivoting front fork, there really isn't much to play with.  I think it's best kept as a display model.  Adding shocks and maybe adding a round 1X1 plate (to the top of the gas tank area) to represent a gas cap would look make it look even better.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The red piece are perfect where they should be and the wheels are great. This isn't just a Lego Legend, it's a Technic Legend.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Amusedmaj","2011-07-11T14:39:45.08Z","Neat little technic set","This is a really neat little technic set and one I'm glad I still have.&nbsp; I received this when I was a child and recently reassembled it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an easy set to build and shapes up into a fairly nice little motorcycle.&nbsp; <br><br>There aren't many parts included in the set and, to that end, not a lot of other things you can build with the supplied parts, but it is worth adding to your collection (if you can find one) if you are a fan of early technic sets.&nbsp; <br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"BrickbyBrickDFM","2020-10-04T06:33:50.82Z","Fun Build and Bike","<p>When I saw this set on eBay, I had to have it. I was able to get it from the seller for $10.00 (US), which I think is a great deal. The set itself consist of 103 pieces, mostly technic bricks. The color scheme goes great together,&nbsp;especially the grey and black to make the engine. The motorcycle stands on an adjustable kickstand. The wheels are the one similar to some classic space vehicles from the 1970s &amp; 80s. The build is simple and fun. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only negative comment that I have is that there isn&#39;t a figure to ride it. That takes away from the playability of the set. &nbsp;You could maybe use a maxifigure or a Jack Stone figure. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, LEGO set 1984 (Motorcycle)&nbsp;is a fun build and will be a great addition to my LEGO Motorcycle collection. &nbsp;</p>
