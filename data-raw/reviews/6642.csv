"Paradoxymoron","2008-11-09T20:13:01.827Z","Mini","I just finished puttiing this set together and it rocks!It looks like the regular sized one(aside from the fact that it's smaller) and has lots of details.  It is extremely strong(I just threw it off the computer desk and only one peice broke off!)  It has ten un-tired wheels which can be very useful in MOC's.  That's another thing I like about it.  It has a lot of cool parts so you don't have to like LSW to own it.  The instruction booklet is 18 pages long and very easy to follow(and it has an ad for LSW Clone Wars sets on the back)   I encourage anyone in the US to join Brickmaster fast and get one!  Anyone outside the US look on EBAY or Bricklink cuz this set is awesome.  Can't wait till Jan.! PLAY ON!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Teekay","2009-03-06T09:03:21.437Z","Really detailed MINI","I was so happy when I got Brickmaster for Christmas with this set.

Pros:

Really detailed for its size.
Really rolls on its wheels!
Looks nice in a MINI scene.

Cons:

Only available in Brickmaster.

Bottom Line:

Get this set on Bricklink or eBay if you can get it at a reasonable price. Great MINI!

"tkettle9719","2012-01-06T07:40:39.953Z","Mini? But it's so detailed...","<p>I got this set in November of 2008, and find this to be my second favorite model, after the Venator Cruiser. This is amazingly detailed for a mini.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The details are fantastic, this couldn't have been done better with 100 pieces by me.<br></li><li>-Very Republic-y color scheme, really awesome.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The wheels look very strange the way Lego made it; a reverse looks much finer.<br></li><li>-The dark grey piece in the 5th stud row from the back looks odd. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is an excellent set, filled with detail, and well-made in under 100 pieces. Well done, Lego. I recommend this, if you don't have the pieces.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
