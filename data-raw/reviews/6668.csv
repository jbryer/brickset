"asianlego","2008-10-27T10:55:19.14Z","Jetrax T6 - Coolest Bionicle Battle Vehicle","Jetrax T6 is very agreeable and most people especially Bionicle lovers and those who doesn't mind alot of Technic pieces would like it. The Jetrax T6 is a ToysRus exclusive (as far as I am acknowledged).

The vehicle bears a close resemblance to a podracer from Star Wars, which kinda boosts its overall asthetic appeal. The Midak blasters actually fire (after testing it at the TRU LEGO booth).

The vehicle is surprisingly long, about half a metre. The vehicle really looks cool, you should get it, eventhough it is quite expensive considering the piece count. But it looks great for display.

"james3426","2009-11-12T16:07:18.14Z","Super-Charged, Super Cool","     I am glad my brother decided to get the limited version now, because it will be harder to find later. First things first; I will review Antroz first.

     Antroz- Not that impressive. The color is mostly what I am talking about; It's bland! Sure, there is some black beneath that dark red, but not enough for me. He also looks NOTHING like his Phantoka form unlike the pilot versions of Lewa and Pohatu. I mean, he has a Piraka torso, and Inika style upper leg armor; nothing like the old Antroz. The only thing of interest on him is the new Kanohi Jutlin, which actually looks a little like the older one with those fangs. In all Antroz deserves a 3/5. (His shoulder armor brings it up. I like them)

     Jetrax T6-This is an AMAZING vehicle! I think it is almost even cooler than the Axalara T9. If you have read my other reviews, you will know I like blades and shields. This has: 4 Aero Slicers; 2 Krika leg halves; 2 Brutaka rotating blades; a Hook Blade (Chirox's weapons); 6 Blizzard Blades; 2 twin cutters; and 3 multi-resistant shields. It's fun to ""obliterate"" a target with the three midak skyblasters. I love how the turbines can fold in and out. The design is very,very complex. It took my brother two hours to build. This huge craft deserves a 7/5!


This set is a must-have for Bionicle collectors who want a rare set. I highly recommend this, but the Axalara T9 still rules.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
