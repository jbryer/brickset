"Gus_263","2008-07-05T18:08:42.937Z","Good ","This set, as a keychain, of course must be cheap, because don't have more than one piece (in rare exceptions). This was recently released, and is a special edition to the 50 years of the Lego brick.

This keychain is just a brick with a different color (gold, that is actually very good), and also, it includes a small keychain with the printed detail of the 50 years of the Lego brick symbol. There is no much to say about it, it is a commemorative keychain, just basic, but still very good about the colors.

Overall, if you want a set more than a keychain, it worth no much the money (well, &#163;2.99 still very cheap), but this keychain is unuseful to increase a set. 

Pros:
Color
content (just a brick, but still very good)

Cons:
Don't increase a set, it is a keychain

So, this set is very good, but could be better with maybe another brick, or just with a cheaper price. Great for these who wants commemorate the 50 years of the Lego brick, but unuseful for these who wish get sets and anything to increase the sets. A 4,3 of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

And though it is not completely painted a gold paint (a bottom and interiors of beige color), it not strongly spoils it, and the detail 3*2 of &quot; 50 years &quot; serves as not less pleasant addition. I advise all!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The store was doing double lego points for club members.  The iteams I bought where on sale also.  I ended up spending about $85 total.  Very nice keychain for the true lego nut.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cashcleaner","2008-07-09T03:33:55.247Z","It's gold.  It's a LEGO brick...","...What more do you want?

Considering I got this item free for spending over $75.00 CAN at the LEGO online store, I'd say it's a fantastic deal.

And beside, you can never have enough keychains, can you?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2008-09-27T07:15:40.03Z","Can't Believe How Much $ I Spent to Get These!","I spent enough money at the LEGO Store in the Palisades Mall in West Nyack, New York to get 4 of these! In order to get 1, I had to spend $75 so I spent at least $300, which included the Model Town House and Green Grocer, a Pick a Brick cup and others. The key chains are a bonus now with the LEGO Catalog that just arrived at my house this week, which reminds me that I should have asked for this key chain when I ordered the City and Castle Advent Calendars. I'll call LEGO later today to see if I can have this added to my order!

Anyway, the brick is striking in all it's gold glory. The underside seems to be tan however, unlike the bricks in the Town Plan set. The little tag included is great as well with the 50 Years Logo on it. I do not have this key chain with my keys because I am afraid of how bad it will end up looking after carrying it around on a daily basis. I'll eventually put it on my work bag or something like that being that I have 4 of them but I just know that it will look horrible after using it for any amount of time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Da_LegoBuilder","2008-07-17T19:30:45.827Z","Real Gold? hahaha...no!","Its not real gold, but it is the most shiniest key chain I've ever seen. I picked mine up after spending $75 on lego at any Lego Store. You can get it while supplies last, get it before someone else does. This is to celebrate the 50th anniversary of lego, and it looks so cool and something to remember Lego by. I strongly suggest you get it, its awesome!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"agent_chase","2009-08-17T23:01:25.857Z","free so i dont care","very shiny and free with cafe corner so its awesome
 
I have a friend who can remove it but id rather keep it like it is
the other good part is how the brick is real and compatable with other bricks",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-09-21T14:18:56.013Z","Got it free!","The way I got was a little strange: I was in Italy, and I went to the toy shop to buy something to play with. I chose the Granite Grinder, and my mum asked for a little discount. The cashier refused, but he showed us a box of key chains, and among them there was this! I immediately chose it, and was fascinated by the shine!

None!

Overall, get it if you can!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
