"newlegoset333","2008-12-27T11:43:31.357Z","Great set, not exaclty accurate though","I got my Brickmaster today, and I was very happy with what I saw. It came in a polybag like the last two sets, and I was expecting it to be small. It was actually very big, and had one new piece, a triangular upward slope double, SO it had 3 studs on top. But, there was room for improvement.

Pros: Big, and fun
Has a clear stand to &quot;float&quot; on
Has engines
Mostly strong build and 84 pieces

Cons: One the tip of the Venator Destroyer, there are supposed to be 2 large rectangular things, where people go inside, Instead, they were replace with giant gunning turrets. (Backwards flick-fire missiles)
No rectangular docking area

"DreamBuilder71","2009-01-10T19:45:37.53Z","AWESOME!","This is actually the best Mini set that Lego has produced!  Fun to put together. Good for display or play.  I see they also made a play size with minifigs, now we need the UCS version and our lives will be complete. :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"captain_radda_radda","2009-03-30T20:39:07.89Z","The Best Mini EVER!","I really miss the minisets. I used to have largescale battles with them all the time. This set is actually pretty big. The only con I noticed is that the twin command bridges were replaced with flick-fires. 

Pros:
Huge
Very accurate
See-thru stand

Cons:
substitue flick-fires for a real command bridge",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-30T19:59:14.75Z","Very detailed Mini","This set does not look like it was ment to play with, but rather to display. you could also break it up for the interesting pieces it has and put the pieces in a separate container if you want to build it back sometime. On to the review.

As I said before, this set was ment for display, not playing, but this is okay with me in this case. The interesting pieces I mentioned are very rare. The two pieces I am mainly talking about are (according to bricklink): Slope, inverted 45 3 by 1 double; Trans-Clear Brick, Round 2 by 2. The double slope is very useful for some MOCs, while the translucent clear round brick can be used for displaying small models. The laser cannons on the side are semi-turnable, which I like.

pros:
Fun to build.
Cool pieces.
Semi-moveable laser cannons.
Good for display.

Cons:
None

This is a cool brickmaster exclusive. If you can find this, this is a big opportunity, so i would get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-Very detailed for under 100 pieces-excellent job.<br></li><li>-This represents the many weapons of this ship- and well.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The light blue piece is the totally wrong choice for this set.<br></li><li>-The little stand is not the best choice for a stand.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is an excellent set, and is worth the quoted $5.99 price tag. I highly recommend this for all Clone Wars fans out there in the world.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
