After that you start building the house and the hill where the windmill stands on.
Some small and nice details included suck as a stowe and a sink.
The &quot;tower&quot; is kind of heavy and needs to be fixed to the stand real tight before you start up the motor.
The total hight is 66 cm (26 inch)to the towertop and then you have the &quot;wings&quot; on top of that.
When you start up the motor you also get light outside the house.
This set is really a must have!
I&#180;m just so happy to own a piece like this",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"icncu222","2009-08-24T01:49:58.263Z","A Great Reason to Come Back to LEGO!","For a good eight years I went through a LEGO withdrawl to where I was involved in many other things that I had no time for my LEGO collection. The withdrawl ended just before graduating this year from college. As a b-day present/graduation present, I purchased this wonderful set off of e-bay. I was speechless at the amazing detail and the fact that the power function addition allowed for lighting in the cottage and for the turbine to move. In addition, this set is very tall with the height being over 2 feet from base to tip of turbine! The addition of a utility van with the Vestas logo makes it even more realistic. Also, the cottage has great features inside like a bed, sink, stove, lattern and many other deatils that fit the classic town theme. I really can't find any flaws with this set short of the usage of 6 AA batteries and heavy price tag. If you are a dormant LEGO collector I recommend this set to rekindle your interest!

"jumalichi","2016-05-06T15:43:05.043Z","A must have","<p>I bought this set 7 years ago to an Italian Vestas employee for a reasonable price and during all this time this box was sleeping in my house...</p>

<p>When my &quot;LEGO room&quot; has been finished i&#39;ve started to build many sets and this one has been finished this morning.</p>

<p>The truck is one of the best ever done by LEGO, i find the proportion perfect with the minifigs and the reparation tools of the VESTAS employees are a good addition.</p>

<p>The little cottage has a vintage style very attractive for the AFOL of the 80&#39;s like me, very tiny and simple but sufficient.</p>

<p>And the windturbine has a very good concept very strong with Technic parts. The lights are an excellent addition.</p>

<p>To conclude everything is perfect, a real pleasure to build and to admire...</p>

<p>If you can buy it not very pricey, don&#39; t hesitate. This &quot;limited VESTAS set&quot; is a must have !</p>
