While this set would certainly look good on a professional's desk, they come at a price only a professional can afford.

This is not terribly complicated in design and can be built for less than $5.00 from the Pick-A-Brick wall from the picture on the front of the box. Buy a whole cup for $15.00 and you can make about half a dozen.

If the additional cost was supporting a foundation for historic preservation or to feed children, I could see spending this for a ""unique"" piece of architecture and history. Unfortunately, I can own this for less ordering the parts from the LEGO online PAB. And no, the engraved ""Sears Tower"" doesn't make it worth $20.00. 

Save your money and make your own from the PAB wall.

I enjoyed the number of tiles for my collection and I also enjoyed the general appeal to this set. It really is something that you can display on a mantel or coffee table and have it fit nicely with almost every sort of room decor.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is sadly a bit expensive for my tastes given the number of pieces, but is made up by the number of tiles, look, and informative booklet.
