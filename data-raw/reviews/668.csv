<p>Building the set is rather straightforward and complies to the 1980ies 4w classic town vehicle standards. No surprises at all.</p>
<p>But besides the the stickers with ""MD"" logo, there is another issue what makes this set very special: the green parts.<br/>Not noteworthy from today's point of view, but back in 1989, green parts were among the rarest colors. Only some baseplates in basic sets were green, some trees and flowers, some plates contained in 6392 airport and of course some bricks from 1980ies castle sets.</p>
<p>So, this milk truck is a real eye-catcher, as long as your classic town layout is limited to 1980ies and early 1990ies vehicles.</p>
<p>It's a shame that this nice promotional set is so rare and therefore high-priced.<br/>But it is no problem to rebuilt it for a reasonable price, with used bricks bought via Bricklink.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,5
