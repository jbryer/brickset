"3DJr","2009-03-21T16:39:26.39Z","Can I get your John Handcock?","This set has a classy look to it, much like the other structres from the Architecture series. Sleak and smooth. The base plate with the building name is a nice touch for display.

The main disappointment is the fact that the lego version is NOT the same shape as the actual building! The JH Center is more like an elongated prism shape with a flat top. As you can see from the image above, the lego set is more like a series of stacked rectangles, each thinner than the last.
Bottom line, you wouldn't know this is the John Handcock Center unless you are told.

I purchased this set from the Sears Tower gift shop in Chicago Il USA for $24.99. It is a little pricey for a 69 piece set, but it is a exclusive item and only found at select retailers. Of course you can spot it on e-Bay for twice as much too.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"woodall_aidan","2011-05-16T18:38:42.48Z","cool-ish","This set costs too much. It really doesn't have that many unique pieces, except for the only decorated piece, the sign. The Architecture series should have either stickers or more decorated pieces. 68 normal pieces and 1 decorated piece. That added together really isn't worth 19.99. This set gets a 3/5 for that. &nbsp; <br>",TRUE,3,1,2,1,2
"Energyarrow","2012-07-20T14:50:52.407Z","""That's a nice model of the Sears Tower you've got there! What's that? It's the John Hancock? Oh.""","<p>I love Chicago.&nbsp; I love the parks, I love the museums, I love the food, and I love the architecture.&nbsp; It's really not suprising that Lego instantly looked to the Windy City for their first architecture sets, but maybe it would've been a good idea if they had picked a sky-scraper that wasn't so triangular... On to the review.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Basic bricks, which are always nice - even if they're all black.&nbsp; Four circles (one smooth), two black studs, eleven one-by-two plates with one stud on top, two square studs (one smooth), and two white poles make up the tower with the other black bricks.&nbsp; So simple but pretty good pieces. 
<li>An imprinted piece that says ""John Hancock Center"" on it. 
<li>Comes with a little booklet with information on the JH center.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not my idea of a good price. 
<li>Isn't even the same shape as the JH center.&nbsp; The model is four blocks of bricks on top of each other, then two poles on either side of a rectange.&nbsp; On the actual building, the poles are <em>in </em>that rectangle. 
<li>Just kind of boring.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this set is not worth&nbsp;buying unless you're trying to collect all the architecture sets.&nbsp; It's expensive, boring, and a poor model.&nbsp; Why, oh why must Lego slack when it comes to older fans?</p>",TRUE,2,4,5,1,2
