As many have criticized, Anakin is a bit ugly. His hair is based on the magna design for Exo-Force while his face contains various battle scars. The torso is quite simple, although a belt would be nice. One of the annoyances of a key chain is that the minifig cannot be split to use those torsos. This is a pro for those who want an intact minifig. The price is also a problem as 4 used seems a bit steep for just one piece(if you listen to Lego’s description, then yes). Unlike other key chain’s, Lego removed the Lego logo plate that came with most key chains. I don’t recommend this if you want the minifig, go for Anakin’s fighter. This set is good for your keys, as they always add something to do with your keys when you’re bored.
