Cons I cant really think of any.*****5 stars.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Although he is glued together (shame, I really wanted to see how his face looked like!) you can still twist his head round and bend his knees and move his arms. I have placed this on my pencilcase and I intend to play with it during my major examinations next week (after finishing each paper, of course!)

only 2 problems:
1) keychain:
cut it off

2) body doesn't come apart
you can't put gear on him

Apart from these two problems, a great addition to your clone wars collection",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
