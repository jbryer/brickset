"P13c30fch33s3","2009-03-23T07:16:25.733Z","Commander Cody! (without spending loads of money on the gunship)","I like this keychain because it is a way to get Commander Cody without purchasing the Republic Gunship 7676. The only 2 problems are:
1) Getting the key chain off.
Cut the small ring
then sand the rest
get some paint and repaint anything you may have sanded off.
2) You can't take hime apart to put gear on him

apart from those 2 reasons, a great addition to your clone wars collection!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

He has detailed armor and a detailed mask but you can't remove the mask and see his face.But now I have Cody and Rex together! Here's the review.Pros:Detailed armor,Cheaper way to get him instead of buying the Republic Gunship,He has to be in every clonewars collecton.Cons:You can't remove his helmet and see his face.But actually what I did was that I used this type of wrench at my cousin's house for my Ashoka,Obi Wan,and Rex key chains and the chains came off and now their heads can come off but their helmet,hair and horns can't be removed so I plan to do that with Cody.*****5 stars",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
