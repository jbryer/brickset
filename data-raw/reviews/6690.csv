"water_jedi_17","2008-10-21T20:11:53.78Z","Obi-Wan Kenobi, Guardian of your Keys!","If you read my Anakin review, you know I won’t say ”buy the overly expensive LAAT” Instead, I will recommend this set for anybody seeking the rare Jedi master. Obi has an interesting hair piece, most likely new, and although you can’t remove it, you can always stare in we as you stare at it. Obi has an interesting expression, sort of annoyed(most likely at Anakin). The torso is much better than Anakin’s, having a belt and general like clothing with the white armor. I recommend this for anybody although the price is somewhat expensive(again read my Anakin key chain review for more info).
