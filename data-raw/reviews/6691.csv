But Lego has really made a great job of making Plo Koon unlike Asajj Ventress. Just like Kit Fisto, they both share plastic head pieces. His mask extends a little too low since in Clone wars series, his mask is more larger. But, anyway, his torso contains an interesting weave across his waist, although a few details wouldnâ€™t hurt. Unlike many other character key chains, the two jedi I previously reviewed lack a cape. Is lego cutting back on elements for clone wars characters to get more money than los it? But, although the price of key chains is somewhat expensive, I would recommend this to anybody who wants something to do with their keys, or own a rare mini figure. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Zacherano","2010-05-22T17:02:15.513Z","Great Minifigure Keychain with High Price","&nbsp;Although I do think this is one of the best minifigure key chains, Lego's massive franchise still feels that they are able to overprice key chains that we still want to buy but are disgusted by the price.&nbsp; We need to rebel against Lego's ridiculous key chain prices.&nbsp; They are now $5, and they used to be about half that much!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for the actual key chain minifigure, I think it is quite good.&nbsp; I am glad they make key chains of rare figures like the Jedi Master Plo Koon for the pleasure of using them with our keys.&nbsp; The minifigure is very enjoyable, with a rubber head similar to that of Jedi Knight Kit Fisto, a fairly detailed torso and unusual leg color, and a helmet that extends over the body.&nbsp; The only con with the minifigure itself, which is also featured in the ""Republic Attack Gunship"" and Plo Koon's Jedi Starfighter coming out this summer, is the length of the helmet, which does not extend as long in the actual Clone Wars TV series.&nbsp; One cannot fault Lego for this minor incongruity, however, as if the helmet were any shorter, the proportions of the minifigure would not be accurate. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please keep appreciating Lego's marvelous key chains, but remember to ask for better prices!&nbsp; :-)",TRUE,3,4,1,3,3
