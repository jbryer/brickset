The vehicle, while lacking a bottom plate (which would make the wheels hardly touch the ground, lowering the playability), the set itself is a small collectable vehicle. The car is accurately designed, and not to boxy, either! The really cool part is that the light on top is a plate wedged in between studs, an old technique, not used anymore, making it unique! The three printed parts in this set are not unique, since they appear in other sets, but this is the smallest of them, since the &quot;police&quot; brick is only found in one other set (a  classic &quot;grab jaw armed&quot; figure set), and the grill part is found in only 10 other sets, all very old. 

Please note: when buying this set, be sure to ask whether the printed parts are original, since the ones appearing in this set are embossed prints, since there are other versions, some of which are more or less rare. Also watch out that the two 1x2 bricks DO have a bar in the middle, and DON'T have the &quot;frosted&quot; line across the sides, though these parts are said not to appear in any sets, it is most likely that since both parts are old, no one knows what sets included them or not. It may appear that the 1x2 standard bricks are cheaper, but you may receive a frosted one instead... If you want parts for this set, BEWARE, since there are many parts which are similar, but are not the same!

Otherwise, this is a great collectable set from the classic LEGOLAND vehicles series and looks good in any collection!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The box is very small, and can be open in a picotted part located in the box's center, different from any box now. The box's size is approximated the same of the impulse sets boxes, very good, the car can be putted here without dismantle.

The set have aprox. 11 pieces (i don't know exactly), what is very basic, but it shows a decent building, just like a small set from those times (early 70's years). Each two wheels wheels are the part of the lateral sides of a 2X2 brick, and each wheel have one stud at the side, and are covered by a rubber circular piece, wich now is very rare, this model of wheel disappeared. A black plate is putted above, and it have some increasements like two 4X1 bricks at the two sides (these bricks have a &quot;police&quot; word printed at the sides), one 2X4 brick at the back and another 4X1 brick at the front, with printed details of flashlights and a radiator. It is too distant to be aerodynamic, but shows a very nice color scheme. 

Above the plate, there are more bricks, all transparent (also called as frosted), that covers a part of 6X4 studs. At the sides there are two 1X2 bricks making the lateral windows, and at the front and back of the plate, there are two 4X2 bricks with diagonal parts.These bricks don't show a very good accuracy with a real car, but still useful and representative, the color and shape makes it looks like a bit near with glasses and windows of a car. Above the transparent bricks, the car have a black plate with 4X4 size (with studs at the top), making the car's ceiling. 

An interesting form of building can be seen in this little old car. The light at the top and in the front (represented by a 1X1 sized blue plate) don't have connection by any stud, it is fitted between studs, this form of building isn't used anymore.

Overall, this car is very rare, is also small (the set and the box) and is pretty cool also, with a decent playability, altough without some of the new stuff (it is basically made by bricks and plates).

About the rarity, it is very rare and is a great (but small) set with good but few parts (some looks like to be the same with these, but are just similar). So, if you search to find this set, I recommend to search for it complete, not by finding pieces. By Ebay you could buy it, but now it is more easy to get in Bricklink, by aprox. 4 to 5 dollars, wich is a bit expensive (more expensive than an impulse set), but it worth the money, if you wish to get a rarity to your collection.

I must say, I was very surprised to see this set during the LUG Brasil meeting, this is the oldest set I saw builted at my front. Also, I agree with krysto2002, this set is very good to any collection, is a rarity from the Legoland classic theme. And also, you have to be informed about the pieces, wich are very rare, and have resemblances with some other pieces, but in many cases aren't the same.

Due to the rarity, playability and interesting building (not too accurate with real life cars from the 70's years, of course, but good), I rate this set a 5 out of 5.

This Legoland police car will do very fine indeed. The car is the same as all cars from that period, a 4x10 base plate, two wheel sets, a head lights beam in front and a 2x4 brick as a trunk. Windows are &#189; frosted roofs. What makes this into a police car is the 2x3 bricks with police on it, one blue police light on top of the roof, and the black and white colour scheme. Quite simple but very effective, is it instantly recognizable as a police car. The 2x3 bricks with police are with a quality that the don’t make anymore these days because they haven’t lost colour to this date. So for a starter set this is a very good one. And while you are collecting sets for your Legoland town, why don’t you buy two? They’re not expensive, and what is a town with only one police car? The black and white colour scheme is rather ‘American’ because it makes you think of the 1970s police cars from American television series. But with Lego you can change that into your own national colour scheme.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>So simple a design, but such an integral part of my playtime for years and years to come. I smashed these two police cars into every baddie that stood in their way, yet they remained intact for the impending battle the following day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Relegated to that big bucket of LEGO that stood dormant for nearly 40 years whilst I grew up and built &quot;real&quot; LEGO instead, I had forgotten the simple pleasures of these timeless vehicles until they were unearthed by my daughter... and the nostalgia flowed thick and fast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once I manage to sneak them away from her I will again be able to truly appreciate the simple yet timeless appeal, and perhaps relive some precious childhood memories as I smash them into each other (but only when no one in the office is looking at me).&nbsp;</p>
