The set was pretty good because you could uncouple the trailer, drive around, lift off the pallet etc.  The parts which made the greatest improvement to my Lego collection were the wheels and the towing hitch.

With that towing hitch you could make trailers and caravans for your cars, and 4 more sets of wheels was always useful.

The forklift truck piece was quite good, and got used a lot, although it was hard to integrate into other models you built yourself.

Worth 3/5 for the trailer hitch on its own, it transformed my Lego play!!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Despite it hailing from the pre-minifigure era, it&#39;s very playable. It&#39;s a relatively simple build and had the novelty of a new technical piece in the lifting mechanism (if only ours had worked properly - but the spring kept pinging out of place) and with the trailer it&#39;s pretty versatile. It&#39;s easy to add in Minifigures and in our regular convoy of vehicles this could take several passengers in the trailer and on and around the car, including one sitting in the lifting platform so long as the vehicle was steadily driven. And it&#39;s interesting to see that bricks were printed with logos before stickers were introduced.</p>
