The low loader has a ramp for the forklift. The ramp works well, even after over 35 years, and it hasn’t been broken. That’s quite remarkable for a old and vulnerable mechanism with outstanding pins.

The forklift is simple in terms of design, but the lift works well, also still after over 35 years. The string has never been replaced. 

Additional is a pallet with “boxes” on it. This adds to the playability. It is easy to make your own set of extra pallets and add them to this set. This enhances the playability ever further.

Overall a good set when you collect 1970s sets.
