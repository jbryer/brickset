mini-figure and the vessel itself. It is also the only hovercraft for 
the Spyrius theme.</p>

<p>You should definitely get this set, but only if you 
got other Spyrius sets, as this alone doesn't have the greatest 
playability.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,4
"James83","2017-08-25T15:35:07.357Z","Small but Neat","<p>This pocket-money set is typical of most of these sets, a decent craft which is basic but useable and a way to increase your manpower and coming with a couple of handy tools and bricks you can use elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This space scooter is a very quick build but its still nicely designed. The wing brick forms the base, the nose and pilot&#39;s backrest being sloped bricks. The pilot gets a printed computer circuit brick as a control panel. The two engine thrusters with red cone &#39;flames&#39; sit on hinge bricks and can be moved up and down. Two vent bricks complete the decoration. The hand-held torch/laser can be stowed in one of the holes in the thruster bricks, but the pilot must carry his radio at all times. Its a basic craft but it has all the essential features.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>This sneaky Spyrian is a standard figure with printed torso and a printed head with red hair and&nbsp;headband. He comes with two hand-held tool, a torch/laser gun and a radio. Since most Space sets after the M-Trons abandoned these radios this seems slightly achronistic but at least you still got two items with this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>The set has room for personal additions for example&nbsp;you can upgrade the engines or add jet thrusters onto the wing tips. Its a nice basis to build on or you can simply enjoy racing around with it as it is. When you break it down you get some nice red-black hinges and a wing brick to add to your collection. All these reasons make it excellent value for money.</p>
