I've been using this box for nearly a year now since my kids got it for me for fathers day. It's a nice sized box to hold a good sized lunch (for me) but it is not water-tight (just use it for sandwiches).

Every time someone sees the brick they have to pick it up and have a look so you can be sure to get some attention with this thing.

The only downside (hence the 4) to the box is that it is not actually a stackable brick, and I think it would have been nice if it was possible to stack a few of these together (for the very hungry among us) or maybe even combine it with Duplo or Quadro.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:
its an ok container. take your lego sets in it, maybe not your lunch.

cons:
it doesnt have enough to make it a real hit.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

You definitely can not brick something with liquid in here. Also you can not put chips and use it as storage, since it will catch air.<br>I use mine a couple of times, and everytime I bring it, there always people who distract by it's sight and ask me about it. Really nice box for starting conversation.<br>The con for this box is that the material. I feel that the plastic body is not too sturdy and not as solid as a lunch box supposed to be.<br>In the end, I use it as brick box for storing the 2x2 bricks inside. So it serve it purpose, I never misplaced any of my 2x2 bricks after that.<br>Hope Lego will launch other boxes like this, only in different size of brick. Perhaps 2x3 brick and 2x4 brick?<br>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4
