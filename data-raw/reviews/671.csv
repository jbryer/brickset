Travelled with the Color Line ferries several times after that, and never saw the set. Some years later it was again in the tax free store and I was thrilled! Looks just like the real thing, which I think most likely is a Color Line ferry named Christian IV. I am not sure if it still operates. Opening mechanism at the back is great.
