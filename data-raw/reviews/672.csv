I like the surfboard alot because Lego doesn't make surfboards for minifigs anymore.  The sail is also pretty cool too. Whether you're not a surfer or a pro shredding it up at Trestles or Mavericks, this is a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Tiene piezas interesantes por ejemplo la vela o la tabla. La minifig no corresponde mucho en vestimenta. Escasa jugabilidad. Muy swoosh. Lo siento pero si no entendéis el Español se siente, paso de escribirla en Inglés...",FALSE,4,3,3,2,4

Looks great, and uses two bar pieces to hold it in place. I lost the horizontal bar, but have ordered a replacement bar from Bricklink, which is a fantastic resource.</div><div>Playability: Superb, especially if you have other beach/water/city sets.</div><div>Building experience: Basically nil.</div><div>Overall: Good set.&nbsp;</div>",FALSE,5,5,3,5,5
