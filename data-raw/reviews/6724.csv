Well I am going to review everything I own so I figure I might as well comment on this LEGO Keychain even if it doesn't involve any building or stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure 100% if this is the exact Keychain I actually own, mine came with a different number on the cardboard and I got it from Toy's-R-Us last christmas when I picked up a few LEGO City sets as a free gift. But they both look the same pretty much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is there to say about a keychain? It's a keychain, right? True, but as far as keychains go I'd have to say LEGO keychains do look a lot more fun than your average retail keychain. You get to carry around your favorite mini-figure with you wherever you go, or have a character that is difficult to come by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't however recommend buying this keychain just to break off the chain part to have a Santa Mini-Figure, that would be silly. I do however recommend that if you'd like to get a Christmas themed keychain for your keychain collection then this LEGO Santa is definitely cute and would make a wonderful present to anyone who enjoys either LEGO or Keychains.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
