"SafePit","2009-04-04T23:42:21.2Z","Wonderful Set","I'm pretty sure this was my first large set as a kid that I still own.  I have very fond memories of putting this set together -- over and over again.  This set is pretty deceptive.  Although it is very simple in design, it has a number of small pieces and design elements that many of today's models lack.  I've enjoyed good mix of pieces.  Back then, flats were pretty rare, as were the round corner pieces.  It is also a great model if you need a large number of small rounds.

Note the first old mini-figures.  Those only lasted a few years before being replaced by the iconic LEGO mini-figs used today.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Bart_66","2013-01-08T12:38:53.28Z","Last big set of ""regular"" LEGO before I switched to Technic","<p>I got this set for my 11th birthday in 1977.I liked the variety of this set,the tanker,the helicopter,&nbsp;the many differend parts.I remember I made the tanker twice as long with my other pieces of LEGO.This was also the first blue baseplate&nbsp;I had,what was nice for my &quot;water&quot; projects.This was my last big set of &quot;regular&quot; LEGO,That fall technic was introduced,and from that moment all I bought was technic,until&nbsp;I was about 14 years old.But this was a nice set I made it many times,also making it bigger,higher and wider.If I see the set I still get a smile on my face.</p>

"Ernst","2015-02-13T18:43:00.787Z","Another Classic set !","<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : This is yet another example of the wonderful things you can do with Lego bricks. In 1977 we had just the standard bricks and what a great result, it really has all the components you expect on an offshore oil rig. Above all that we add the introduction of the mini figures which doubles the playability. I wonder how this set would look if Lego would redesign this set with the bricks and possibilities there are 40 years later. I checked but besides some Harbour sets, no modern day set comes close to this one.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Building 5 bricks</strong> : Counting base plate dots is very important when you start. It is sometimes hard to see where to place the bricks, especially the round 1 x 1 bricks but when you have cleared that stage it is great fun building. Nothing very difficult or special techniques but just big fun. The boat&nbsp;and helicopter are&nbsp;the same, nothing spectacular but brick by brick you end up with a great result. The rig is, although a lot of 1 x 1 bricks are used, very firm and solid and so is the boat.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Parts 4 bricks</strong> : Nothing really spectacular, all normal and useful bricks for this period. Very handy are the white round corner bricks.&nbsp;But some small parts need an extra remark : <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=bb18a"">the yellow ladder</a>, <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=69c01"">the tap with spout</a> and <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=x467c12"">the oil hose</a>. And off course the 3 <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=old014"">mini figures</a>, no &quot;face&quot; yet and arms and legs that can&#39;t move but they are the base of the modern day mini figure ! A weak part were <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=373.1stk01"">the stickers</a> but who can you blame if some are missing or damaged after 40 years....</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong> : The set offers loads of playability thanks to its content : an oil platform, helicopter and a boat you can move on its small wheels. Add the presence of the 3 mini figures and the 5 bricks are explained!!</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Value 5 bricks</strong> : I don&#39;t know what original price was but <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=373-1"">Bricklink</a> offers an average for sold used sets of some &euro;95,00 and for sale even &euro;70,00 more which I consider a lot of money. I found it and was lucky to get it for a &euro;30,00 steal so a good deal for me. The set is cheaper to get if you simply collect the 450 parts and buy the stickers which are still available</font> as well as the instructions.</p>
