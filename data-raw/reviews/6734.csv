"SC_Brik","2008-09-14T09:23:53.327Z","Very well done","I am a car nut and auto technician so this set was high on my list to get this year. The price is a little bit of a shocker but once it was opened up and I started to put everything together it was the least of my worries. The shop is very basice but the color choices and placement make it a great looking building and is a nice addition to any City Display. The three cars are all very different but built very similar which is a good thing since using the LEGO design you could come up with many different styles on your own. The only downfall to the cars is they are fragile and don't allow much playability for young children unless you want to be fixing them often. Which is ironic since this is a Custom Car Garage. 

The four minifigs are all different from one another and the technician fig is a cool looking fig. Out of the three vehicles I think the brown/grey truck does the best job of looking that part of a custom vehicle.

The idea of putting the Digital Design CD in the box is a good one. People that don't know of the Lego digital design will now. All though I doubt there are many people who are lego fans that don't know of it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-08T18:00:56.653Z","Good Set ","When I first heard that Lego was making a set like this, my jaw almost dropped. However, there are some drawbacks to this:

PROS
3 cars
garage
engines
4 minifigs



CONS
Stickers(which aren't really needed)
Cars could be a little bit smaller


Overall, this set isn't bad, but has some weak parts in this set.

1. it's a large, 4-walled hotrod garage, that is totally different from all city garages.

2. the interior of the garage can be observed by lifting off the roofs, and contains an office with a desk, on which a computer and a mug sits, and a large spacious repair area that has a lifting ramp capable enough to support any vehicle that is 6-stud wide and up to 20-stud long.

3. the colour of the garage is tanned, which is my favourite colour!

4. the architectural design of the garage is quite vintage, so it sits very nicely in any town layout that has the cafe corner and the green grocer.

5. 3 fascinating, very detailed hotrods, each with 2 inter-changeable engines - one engine serves as the cover to make it look ordinary, while the other is the ""booster"" or vanity engine that makes it look like a hotrod.

6. the 3 hotrods are at least 17-stud long and 6-stud wide. very big cars!

4. the hotrods are the vintage types and very consistent with the cafe corner and the green grocer designs - if u are looking for vintage cars to go with the entire look and feel of it.

5. 4 very interesting mini-figures - 3 racing buddies and 1 mechanic - that u don't normally find in a regular city set. well, the mechanic is like the construction worker from the city sets, but this one's got a blue cap on. lol!

6. the tanned 6-stud long and 5-brick high wall-panels are a rare find.

however there are some drawbacks:

1. the hotrods, especially the yellow SUV type, are all very fragile, and must be handled with care, even while building. the bits come off very easily, if you are not careful.

2. i thought there should be more tools and accessories, instead of just one saw and a spanner, to make it look more convincing and complete... maybe a couple of spare tires, some car parts, oil barrels, etc would be nice.

3. stickers! well, u don't have to apply them actually. the cars look fantastic without the stickers.

i imported this set myself because it's not available in my country. grab it while u still can.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"SgtSmash","2010-09-10T11:27:45.73Z","Awesome cars and even cooler garage! ","<p>When building my new Lego town, I couldn't help but add this Custom Car Garage. What sold me wasn't the fact that it came with 4 minifigs and a cool retro-style garage, but the cars themselves. They resemble&nbsp;old-style 50's hot rods, and being designed by Lego Fans, had very unique and ingenious touches. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The $79.99 price tag seemed (at the time) a bit steep, which still seems as the biggest downfall. However, in the end, what matters is what you get in the set, and what you get out of it. You can build the cars any way you want...after all,&nbsp;it is a ""Custom Car Shop"". But if you assemble them the way the instructions advise, you probably won't want to. Ingenious touches like chairs for mudflaps, and drink mugs for headlights...you aren't going to find that in any other set. Then you got your engines that you can swap out with the 3 different vehicles. The minifigs themselves are pretty cool. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The garage is bigger than what the picture shows, and what was made available on Lego.com at the time. The interior office is not very big...enough room for a computer and chair, but the garage is big enough to house any of the 3 vehicles&nbsp;jacked up on the hoist. I believe the other item you get with this set is a timing device or clock for if you do street races...at least, I am assuming that is what this&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have police in your town, I would gather these guys would drive them nuts. I put the building on a standard 32 x 32 green baseplate but mating it up to a roadplate doesn't really give you a lot of room in front of the garage to mess around. Plus it seems awkward being right smack in the middle of town. A way to go might be to have a larger grey baseplate and put it out in the boonies away from any law enforcement, but the design of the building kind of goes hand-in-hand with the modular sets. I have mine in kind of a back-alley road behind the modular buildings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last final touch, in the box you get a Lego Creator CD to design your own Lego sets. This is basically the same software you can download from Lego.com, but conveniently included with this set. I would gather because this set was designed by fans. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, a very fun set, and&nbsp;if you can find it for a reasonable&nbsp;price on Ebay,&nbsp;would be a great addition to your city.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
