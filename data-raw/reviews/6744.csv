"austwood","2008-12-19T14:49:51.42Z","Nice pieces, but...","I bought this set for the white wedge wing pieces that I use alot.

The jet when built is very chunky, but very sturdy to handle agressive play.  Most creator flying machines turn out to be too clunky for me.  oh well.  This is still very cool for a small set and contains some great pieces for creative building.  I just can't say no to a LEGO airplane...(except the new ones with the huge swooshy studless fuselages...blehh!)

(Actually I think i can say no to the new Indiana Jones flying wing set too.  I just can't handle that giant one piece wing)

"parchioso","2009-12-14T05:50:53.67Z","It can be more useful than it seems to be - when MOC enabled","The three models are nice but not really impressive, but this set actually contains a good combination of parts that can be used to build something else - such as a MOC mini Starfighter.

Please check out my blog entry for a pictorial review, as well as the MOC built only using parts from this set, and used them all:

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-15T12:38:11.94Z","LEGO Creator - Mini Jet Review","This is a really nice little set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This set may doesn't have any play features but we get 2 more models you can build with the pieces of this set. This plane is very easy to maneuver as well. As I told you in the beginning: It's a nice little set to have - even for the pieces which you can use for brickfilms and/or MOC's (My own creations) for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-21T18:43:28Z","Mini jet flies past other Creator sets...","So much I can say about this perfect and well-priced set: detailed, even though small...well, here are the Pros and Cons:

Pros:
1. This set may be small, but it is has great details, including small engines
2. Very sturdy, parts barely break off!
3. Portable jet that can turn into a rocket or boat (Who wouldn't want this set?)

Cons:
1. Only one: the front nose will sometimes break off, but its not really that fragile

I recommend this set to anyone! It's an easy build, and anyone will love it (Especially with another small Creator set, such as the Mini Robots) Gets a 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"stevanooz","2011-05-31T03:25:05.47Z","miniature of the big one...","<p>if you ever buy Creator Sonic Boom, then maybe this is the miniature of that model. Looks a bit different, but I believe is the same style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it can be built to another plane model and a boat. Every model look nice in small size. If you have a lot of imagination, you can built it to another model again. I can even built to small snow mobile. Believe me, you can built much more just with small number of bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't say more about the mini products of Creater themes. But if you're a collector and like to show or even put this mini on your card dashboard. This collection of mini surely attract some attetion better than your bobble head in your car.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You won't regret buy this mini set. In fact, you maybe&nbsp;want to&nbsp;buy 3 set of this and create 3 different model and show it. It will looks good on your dashbord... :)</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
"Drumlum","2013-02-01T11:46:38.813Z","Good for a little bit...","Being as this set is a smaller set, it can't really deliver the experience like the big version could. Being a fan of Creator, I got this set I wanted to get 5762: Mini Plane too. Both pretty cool to fly around, but then...well... It gets boring. Usually you get that feeling after you've built all three of the models: The main jet, the space shuttle and the speedboat. Its not much of a waste of money. This set would be a great stocking stuffer or party favor for LEGO fans so for that I can recommend it.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><ul><li>Pros</li></ul></div><div>Small, lightweight.</div><div>Has it's own plastic box to store it in, so its good for travel.</div><div>Quick, easy to build.</div><div>Creator set.

"Snail","2018-09-01T12:58:21.58Z","Nice little Jet","<p>For such a small set, this is well formed and has nice little details, jet fire, air intakes, a rounded cockpit and fine body work. only the vertical stablizers at the back are too clunky for the rest of the model, some special parts might have been better there.</p>

<p>Parts are fairly standard, but used well.</p>

<p>Playability is good as it is very sturdy and does not break apart (of course it has no functions at all).</p>

<p>Got this in a bulk, so i can&#39;t really judge value for money.</p>
