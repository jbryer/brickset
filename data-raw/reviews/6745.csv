A good selection of pieces equals a good bang for your buck. The main two designs are sturdy and there are plenty of possibilities.

Certainly above average, if not stunning.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"chrisdog121411","2009-06-07T20:29:36.153Z","A++++ and 5/5","     I just got this set today at a great price $3.49!! It was a fun build, I really liked the main model. Now lets move on to the review.



     Main model: I know this design is based off a type of jeep. I like how it has two horn parts on the top. The hood can open by using one hinged plat, and one clip. It also has two head lights and two back lights. this is one awesome model.


Telescope handler : based off of the 2008 technic series. simple to build. Uses 98% of parts. the cool part is that the the arm goes up and down. 



Tractor: I'm not going to tell about it yet maybe some other day.





over all 5.9/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Received in the stocking for xmas '09 

A nice 3 in 1 creator set for a few UK pounds

the build was quick and simple as you would expect and creates a nice 4x4 jeep. The opening bonnet is a nice detail as are the horns on the roof.

bigger and better than the creator land-rover clone but not in the same league as the large creator vehicles",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"frycook49","2011-12-19T02:57:06.11Z","Great Value!","I got this in my stocking in 2009, and I was amazed at how much use I got out of it. I loved the fact that it had three&nbsp;different&nbsp;things to build, and I found that the&nbsp;&nbsp;of<span style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;road&nbsp;vehicle&nbsp;&nbsp; was the best, and that the tractor was&nbsp;probably&nbsp;my least&nbsp;favourite. The pieces are nice, but nothing really special (nothing too rare). It is fun to put mini figure on it, and ride it. The set is great value for money/stocking filler, I loved it!&nbsp;",FALSE,4,3,3,5,5
"Firox_5000","2010-09-25T17:12:53.487Z","The good ,the very good and the ugly","<p>This set is another great addition to the creator mini series ,it's good ,it's fun and it's cheap. The set has three models. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4x4 is very neat and has very good detail on the front&nbsp; and back. The front opens and it is very sturdy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Telehandler is also very nice and the lifting arm is very good to play with. The detail is very nice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tractor isn't bad it's not the best model made but at least you get another model to play with when the telehandler and 4x4 get boring. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite a lot of playability and a great set. I recomend you buy it even though it's not as good value now that it is Â£1 more.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
