its very solid and crashable, and looks cool too.  The only problem I had with it is that on the box the wheels seem to be steering on the photo of the main model.  In reality, all 4 wheels are fixed solid.  When i first saw the package on Brickset, I was so excited about a cool non-technic loose steering system to avoid tire dragging while playing!  I feel a little cheated.  Aside from that, this is a cool car, and definetly worth it for some cool green bricks!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"SRoode","2009-01-07T21:24:00.123Z","Basic Car","I did not have much fun putting this little set together, and once built, there was not much playability with it.  As stated before, it does not steer and only rolls straight.  This is one of those sets that looks much better on the box than it does in real life.  Of course, it is also not in scale for mini-figure use.  But for $12.99, I can't really complain.

Pros:
Cheap
Nice color

Cons:
Not fun to build
Not fun to play with
No steering",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

By the way, the green color is very nice and it's a perfect addtion with the yellow car released last year.

I like this but it has been done for collection only, to be exposed on a desk or table.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"zidane","2009-04-07T08:47:24.843Z","Great little green set!","I like this set. All car models especially the main model are great. Car is slick and extremely well designed. Colors are nice.

Only one thing is bad, and that is picture where wheels are turned, but that is not the case with the model... so this is basically a lie!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2009-03-29T16:05:04.687Z","The good, the meh, and the easily modified.","Of course with the creator sets, the ""main"" design is the best.  As with everyone else, I think  it is wrong of LEGO to have a picture on the front of  the box with a turned wheel even though the car cannot turn.   That being said, I went into this knowing full well that the wheels do not turn since I read the multiple reviews before I picked up this car.

The main car is a good design.  It has a fun, sporty look to it.  It is actually of the size that it would fit in with some of the larger vehicles that have come out, like the Speed Racer race cars.  It is a very solid build, and the tons of green is broken up nicely by the white and gray stripes.  It has a really nice low stance that says ""fast.""

The second build, the hot rod is not that impressive.  It s a very simple design, and a little clunky.   I will give the designer points for showing a lot of the brown parts that are included in the set.  It does give it a much stronger rat rod look with some rusty looking areas.   I think it is just too heavy in the back end.

The third design is the race car.  After the car is built, it has the look of the smaller sprint cars.  There are no fins on the front or back.  This is an interesting design because it is very easy to modify to a Formula 1 car.  There are plenty of extra pieces when this car is built to make some major mods, or very slight mods to change the entire look of the car.

All in all, the three cars are nice.  The first version is the best, and will be the one I display.  The nice thing about this model is that the pieces used are for the most part very standard, so it would be very easy to change the colors, or make multiple versions of the same car.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"stevosowl","2009-11-15T15:12:40Z","A nice car, great value","This is my first real buy in the creator series - and i enjoyed the build.

The set makes three models, the f1 style car was easy to put together and looked ok, the hotrod even better.

However the real star is the street car. A good, solid, detailed car that takes 20 to 25 minutes to put together. The scale is nice, the green colour makes the car distinctive and it would have been perfect with steering!

For the price it is a great model and i have the 4939 set on order because of it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"djinuk","2009-12-25T05:48:47.403Z","great solid set, fun build","I got this from tesco, Ive only built the main car, and the build was fun, took about 30 mins, but the finished piece is very study and looks great. Im going to try a few more lego creater sets just for this reason :).

Well done lego, keep the magic happening.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Plastic_Nurak_80","2010-08-29T08:31:12.897Z","Little is better :)","<p>I bought this little car in its second version box (with no steered wheels pictured). I'm satisfied with main model, a good speed car, with those very useful green bricks and plates. Alternate models are not as good as the main, but Formula 1 racer can easily be modified.</p>
<p>Price is cheap (I bought it for 9&euro;90 in Sassari Toys Center store, official price at S@H is 9&euro;99), and I report that it's possible to build with Street Speeder pieces also a little truck in minifig scale.</p>

"dynaman02","2011-10-11T04:09:32.203Z","Street speeder says it all......","<p>This is a really cool set. I really like the creator series and so do my gran'kids. It makes for fun in teaching different shapes and how to build toys that they play with. </p>
<p>Cons: not for children under 3.</p>
<p>Pro's: great for teaching shapes and colors and begining to read and follow directions.</p>

"c05","2021-05-10T01:24:26.48Z","Creator 3-in-1's are always good value!","<p>I built the dune-buggy type car from this kit and it&#39;s very cute and looks good on my shelf. These aren&#39;t minifig scale so playablity might not be as good as a speed champion for kids who want their figs to drive around town, but if you just want a neat&nbsp;display piece, this is a cheap way to get something nice. You can get this set used for 5 bucks and that&#39;s honestly a steal, I&#39;m strongly considering buying two more to make the other two designs.</p>
