Of course it has some useful pieces, especially the 3 bladed technic prop, but the airplane is just too chunky and blocky to look cool.  The harrier is the coolest of the 3 included models.  I always love new airplane sets, and especially creator airplane sets, but this one is just too clunky to be really swooshable.  You can increase swooshibility by decreasing stability and strength in the structure.  Mostly, just by this set for the great pieces and see what you can make!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The jet model looks a bit like a Harrier, but Harrier's main landing gear does not work like that.  Also, the one plus two landing gears make sterring the model a bit difficult.  My suggesting is to replace one 2X2 square piece of the front wheel with a 2X2 swivel piece.  After this, the model can be steered to all directions smoothly.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2009-03-30T13:07:04.293Z","Three Fliers","As per usual, the base model is the best.  It resembles the P-51 Mustang, a great workhorse of WW2.  The model is really well designed.  It has a very strong structure, has working landing gear!
The only drawback of this build is the engine.  With the design, the engine spins when the propeller does.

The Harrier.  It is a good build, and makes a very convincing harrier model.  It has been mentioned before that the landing gear is not accurate for the landing gear on the real world harrier, but at least they made the back gear work.  It is actually a better looking model with the gear fully removed and displayed in a flying pose.

Helicopter.  This is a fairly sturdy design.  It too has a few flaws that are more due to the use of pieces from the main model.  The top rotors sit way too high in the air, and seem to just stick out there.   The tail rotor almost works, except that the rotor is outside of the protective housing.

With a good model for the main, and two other models that are adequate, this is a good set.  There are no super special pieces, but this does make a really nice desktop display piece. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set has three models like every creator set one of them is like a mustang (it has that landing gear and its on the box) the second is like a sea harrier and it has a helicopter

i have nothing bad to say about this set it is great!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

BUT the employee said they would be able to ship it directly to my house (with $0 shipping) if I bought it then and there in the store.<div><br></div><div>About a week later it came to my house, and boy; was I glad I bought this set! Everything about this set is fantastic! The color, the size, the design! Looks great with my other planes and helicopters!</div><div><br></div><div>I mainly reviewed this set to emphasize my first paragraph: I've shopped in a zillion other stores, but none were as&nbsp;forthcoming&nbsp;and helpful as the LEGO store. The fact that they helped me get a set that I REALLY wanted despite the fact that they didn't have it in stock is an example of why I love LEGO so much! No other company has ever done such thing for me!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"av8r1973","2011-01-02T21:58:56.81Z","Great aviation themed set - secondary models need help","I bought this one to build with my 3 and 5yo daughters because Toyland in Taipei had a discount that day. &nbsp;We have built the main model and the helicopter so far, but haven't taken it apart to build the third model. &nbsp;Quick review on the two I have built.<div><br></div><div>Plane: While most reviewers classify this as a P-51 lookalike, I think it's more like a cropduster with retractable gear. &nbsp;First, the color - most cropdusters in the American southeast are yellow and black. &nbsp;Second, the big radial engine - most vintage dusters have big radials, too. &nbsp;That aside, it is a great primary model. &nbsp;The retractable gear with locking mechanism are the most fun for my 5yo to play with. &nbsp;She can extend each gear leg, then lock them in place and land it anywhere. &nbsp;The process reverses after takeoff. &nbsp;The wings are sturdy and the radial engine has some unique parts/colors that add some realism. &nbsp;the exhaust system is clever and realistic. The tail is remarkably sturdy (typically the weak point in any aircraft model). &nbsp;Neither girl has managed to break it off yet. &nbsp;Well done LEGO!</div><div><br></div><div>Helicopter: Not quite as impressed with it. &nbsp;Landing gear is a bit unstable and tends to fall off easily. &nbsp;Fortunately, you don't need the landing gear much because you can't take off with broken rotor blades. &nbsp;What's a heli without spinning blades? &nbsp;As soon as we try to spin them, one of the blades flies across the room and under the couch. &nbsp;Spoils the flight. &nbsp;Perhaps a plate on top to lock the rotor blades in place would have been a good solution. &nbsp;For this reason, the Playability rating is a 3/5 for me. On the good side, the shrouded tail rotor was a nice touch.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, the kit is worth the buy. &nbsp;We love Creator because of the 3 distinct and different models included. &nbsp;It certainly increases playability. &nbsp;The price is good for such a sturdy model, too.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,5
