This is the perfect combination of regular bricks and technic elements, and creates a very authentic impression of a race/sports motorcycle. The rear suspension will amaze you!

This set includes a very special cycle steering bracket element which should be very useful in creative building, as well as all-new tires (great!), and a diverse mix of wonderful pieces.  This is by far the best creator set of 2009, and probably second  only to &quot;Cool Convertible.&quot;

Alternate models include a great looking dragster and chopper bike.

Buy this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
