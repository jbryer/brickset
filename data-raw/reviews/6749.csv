"BatonMedved","2009-01-07T15:43:15.84Z","Pretty but cut a bit","Lego classics - small nice model. But in other views it shows us some ugly square forms.

And a strange loader design.

Nevertheless, it's much better than another one from 2005, now showing small size and more detail. It looks much more realistic to the old one, and along with a small dozer from Construction Site shows a neat scene.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"00se7en","2009-01-10T20:35:01.14Z","Now THIS is the best loader in the city","A while back I wrote a review on set #6658 saying that it was the best loader in Legoland.  That is no longer the case.  This new set is bigger and better, with a more realistic design.  With just a little creativity it might be possible to replace the bucket with other attachments since there are some convenient mounting spots on the front.

One thing that is a bit strange about this model is the way the bucket attaches to the rest of the vehicle.  It has a very narrow clip which must be stabilized with the middle beam on the bucket arms as shown in the cover photo to prevent it drooping.  However, the instructions do not explicitly show this center beam being attached at both ends.  Either way, the result is a little funky, although not as simplified as the older bucket design, so it does provide for more flexibility in other models.

Since the cab is mounted on the rear of the articulated chassis, steering the vehicle by pushing on the cab requires some counter-intuitive moves.  However, this is a great looking model, and unlike its predecessor #6658, it was given the correct name :)

This is certainly a worthy addition to your Lego city construction site.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Exo_brick","2009-03-10T16:27:00.78Z","Neat","I like this little loader, although TRU priced it higher than my liking. A quite accurate design. The scale is spot on. The newish wheels add a better ""off roady"" look. Functionality scores medium because the cabin doesn't come off easily. The center hinge is a little loose, but that isn't bad. The bucket, however, is a great design compared to the old one. The construction is a nice break from the last 5 sets I've built (Telescopic handler, Green Grocer, Imperial Star Destroyer (minifig one), Cafe Corner, and market street). Those five left me in shock at just how many 7900 pieces are. Enough of that. The next set I'm getting is the dump truck. Hope the duo is a good crew, until I get the rest. The guy is your generic city worker, whether its for construction, or pushing carts. A little smaller than expected (but what set isn't?) Overall, I'd definitely buy this set again.

This is a brilliant little set, though somewhat pricey for what you end up with.  That aside, the details and technical precision of the gestalt is one of the best I have seen in the last decade.  There is not even a hint of juniorisation with this front end loader, a nasty period in Lego product development history I still am recovering from.

Though seeming to be a somewhat simple build from the outside, actual construction was detailed and required a little more concentration than usual to get the job done.  Built for form more than function, this small set still does satisfy those of us who like to see more movement and features in City models.  The scale is perfect, especially regarding the bucket and wheels.  The only fault I had was with the cabin.  A hinge on the roof of the cab would have allowed easier and neater access than what has been designed.  

Overall, an excellent set for your City collection that you can take anywhere with you.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Rad","2009-01-10T21:24:13.967Z","Nice little set","I bought this set along with the new dump truck.

I like the big, rugged wheels, and the movement of the front and back-end is easy. The excavator bucket movement is firm and holds in place, there is also a little latch so it'll hold even the heavier loads in place.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lotographia","2009-04-23T23:14:24.043Z","The guy in the picture is trying to wave away the stench of the air-tight cabin.","This has probably been said many times before, but this set is the perfect companion to the dump truck in the same range. The loader picks up the boulders and puts them in the dump truck to be taken to wherever it is that unwanted boulders go. I like to think this compatability is intentional.

There are a couple of things I like about this and a couple of things I don't. I like the way the truck pivots at the front so you can steer it around, but I don't like the way the front catches on the back when you're trying to turn it. The pieces are slightly too close together. This might be intentional so it's easy to get the wheels perfectly aligned, but I think I prefer it if this didn't happen.

Also, the scoop has slightly too many articulation points. You can't really see on the picture but there actually three joints between the digger and the scoop. This makes it unnecessarily complicated, two joints would have been fine.

I do like the little bar you can see between the main bars at the front, though. You can lodge it against the front of the truck so you don't have to worry about the loader carrying anything too heavy.

This set isn't really the greatest, but if you can forgive the quirks it's worth owning.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>Aesthetically, it is a very nice little jewel. I love the all transparent diver's cabin. Every part of the vehicle is in good scale&nbsp;and &nbsp;proportion. The yellow, black and grey color scheme looks very nice and can match with all city construcion sets.</p>
<p>Usually for a small vehicle of this size , it can only go straight and cannot turn. The kumckled design enable the turning of the small front loader so easy and fun. The friction of&nbsp; joints holding the front shovel firmly, so that it can be turned&nbsp; and stayed at any angle as you want.. The wheels&nbsp; are big with very good tyres also.</p>

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-12-18T05:21:56.513Z","A Real Front-End Loader…","I remember seeing this set (7630) on the Lego Website and thinking what an attractive little set, I tried a number of times in my local Argos but it was always out of stock.  At the start of December I was at the Trafford Centre, walking through Marks & Spencer and I spotted this set for £9.99.  I think I paid a little over the odds for this to be honest but I haven’t seen it recently in the local Toys R Us so I bought it.  Incidentally, some other Lego sets in the store seemed to be priced lower than the RRP so you could be lucky, I am guessing that the stocking of Lego is a Christmas promotion though.

As for the set, I am really impressed with it.  It is my first Construction set; I think the Dump Truck will be my next purchase as this set seems to ‘marry’ up with that set very well.  

The loader is presented in a high-visibility yellow colour scheme with huge go anywhere tyres.  These are accompanied with yellow wheels.  The two-section model pivots slightly forward of the cab, allowing turning to be achieved.  The turning circle is tight, but with some stage-manoeuvrability it is possible to turn the model and access hard to reach areas of the construction site.  Ladders allow ‘access’ to the small fully-enclosed cab, this has a yellow roof with adjustable lights, vent and an amber emergency beacon.  The rear of the cab also has a small exhaust pipe, brake lights and more vents; also warning chevrons are located on the rear bumper.  

The bucket is attached to a loading arm which can be raised and lowered to many different angles; there is also a support bracket which can be positioned in two ways allowing the bucket to be in the ‘raised’ position and attached to the bucket for extra strength.  The bucket also tilts allowing the load to be released.

The minifig supplied with the set wears an orange work suit with red hardhat; he is also wearing grey ‘gloves’.

Overall a great little set, the model is very realistic and looks great on my desk here, it’s a pity that the roof of the cab doesn’t hinge off so that access can be gained without having to remove a few parts but other than that it’s a really good, popular set.  I can see now why it was never in stock at Argos!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>Got this yesterday from John Lewis for 9.95. Fancied a Lego 'fix' ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great set, only gripe is the stabiliser bracket for the scoop, the instructions don't suggest connecting it to the flat plate with angled teeth that holds the scoop and yet the box photo suggests its a 'pneumatic' type of thing that is connected. When you try and tilt the scoop when the bracket is connected the two parts disconnect...In the small catalogue style photo of the range in the back of the instructions it shows it dangling disconnected....Lego should have made the instructions more clearer....does anyone else have the same with the bracket coming away when you angle or tilt the scoop? Also, the scoops weight makes the two arms droop down when you try and have the scoop in an aloft position....the connection rods shouldn't have been the smoother type but something with tighter grip....Other than that, its a great set. </p>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-28T13:19:34.177Z","Hard Hat Area around Construction Equipment","<p>Set #7630 Front-End Loader: I purchased this set in January I believe or perhaps it was in December of last year around boxing day, but that is unimportant for this review, I picked it up and I was not dissapointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is one of the first Construction vehicles I have owned in a large scale (well, largish at any rate.) my old Town collection was mostly composed of Racing sets and special Bonus Packs that gave a few interesting little sets to build and play with. Most of my Town was long gone by the time I chose to give away a lot of my older LEGO to the younger generation, I had fond memories with it, but now I have a City slowly coming together and this set is a must have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Front-End Loader is built with typical yellow and dark grey/black pieces. It has four large tires that can roll and a shovel for digging up dirt/LEGO bricks and things. The build in the instructions uses pieces that I was unfamilar with at the time and I found them to be quite interesting looking. There are a few stickers included with this set that can be applied or left off if the builder chooses, they don't offer up much new in the way of details or anything like that. They're just the set's number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is a nice hard hat wearing Construction worker, and has a nice torso with dark grey gloves. (Perhaps he operates his vehicle in the winter as well to help clear snow.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I am very pleased with the look and feel of this set and think it stands out among my meager City collection so far as the best. If you haven't already picked it up and are looking around for a cheap set you can't go wrong with the Front-End Loader. It's under 20$ and pretty easy to build and play with.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
