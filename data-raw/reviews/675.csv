None of the elements is particularly hard to find, especially if you're willing to take liberties with the colours used in this model, so you can easily build it yourself. The question you'd have to ask yourself is: do I need yet another car work shop in my town?

This was the first classic town set to have a truck with low-loader. Using a heavy rig like this for 'hauling' go-karts appears to be bit of a missed opportunity. It looks better with a front-loader or a heavy-duty crane sitting on its back.
The cabin of the truck can be tilted but is quite out of proportion compared to the chassis.

As a threesome, the go-karts do have some entertainment value in staging a 'Italian job'-like, high speed chase around your town.

Good colour scheme and plenty of useful pieces for alternative building.  Pretty rare, but certainly worth tracking down.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
