"Zrath","2008-11-19T21:19:02.78Z","First! :D","Lego has some nice stuff in the Construction sub-theme coming for 2009.
This is the first set out of the gate, picked up at a neighborhood Toys'R'Us recently.
This dump truck is pretty cool; the nose and cab have a clean, modern design to them; I love the rearview mirrors anchored to the roof of the cab; the use of large Bionicle parts to round out the bottom corners of the dump bucket is inspired and they fit in perfectly; the new knobby tires are nice; and this set brings back the old articulation pieces originally invented for Classic Space.
My set was missing a part, however. I will be contacting Lego to get a replacement part.
Currently, this set is not listed on Lego.com, nor Toysrus.com.
You have to go to Lego stores or Toys'R'Us stores to get it.
 
A nice way to kick off the new batch of Construction stuff.
Can't wait for the rest!

PROS
rugged wheels
boulder
great detail
minifig included

CONS
are the cones really neccessary?

Overall, this is a very good set to start off 2009.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-12-13T11:06:22.843Z","Saw it, Had to Have it!","This is a really nice set, and a great addition to my construction set.  It works really well with the Construction Digger (7249) but is too big for the mini digger (7246).

The tires are great, and makes it able to go ANYWHERE!  It folds in the middle to steer and is able to get into tight spots for it's length.

The overall build of the truck is very well done with good design features like a dumping back end, and adjustable mirrors that different than the other truck designs.  The only downfall is the lack of a tailgate.  I don't know if it is from the odd design of the back end with a bunch of curves, or some other reason, but it is a bit strange to have the back open.

Oh yeah, I cannot forget to mention the boulders.  They are big and it is nice that one of these sets actually comes with something to do with their job.  Usually it is a vehicle and driver alone.  This guy has a job.  Too bad there is not a Lego Construction vehicle that can pick these things up yet.

I recommend this set as a good price for the vehicle, and a great addition to your construction site as well.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Rad","2009-01-10T04:22:30.14Z","Cool Construction Truck","I picked this set up today and it was quite fun to build. I like the wheels, included boulders and the dumping back end is cool. 
 
However, I would of liked to see the mirrors a chrome colour rather than just yellow to add a 'tad' more realism.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SRoode","2009-01-07T21:35:12.39Z","Well Worth the Price!","This was a very fun set to build, and even more fun to play with.  It's extremely rugged, steers great, and the dumping action is nice too.  In many ways, I feel it is a superior set to the Dozer set (7685) since it is 1/2 the price, and more rugged.  The boulders are very nice too.  Being a dad who builds the sets, and having a 5 year old who plays with them, I always appreciate a set that is fun to build (for me), and fun to play with (for him).  It's just a great set for the price.  The only minus, if I have to be nit-picky, is that the barrier does not have lights on top, while set 7685 includes lights on top of the barrier.  I know I could take them off the cones, but they look funny when you do that. Those 2 extra pieces should have been included in the set.

Pros:
Very fun to build
Very rugged and fun to play with
Smooth riding (great tires!) and nice steering
Great boulders

Cons:
The barrier should have included 2 lights",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DarthMunich","2009-01-12T09:30:40.89Z","Not so good","Pros:
easy to build
nice wheels
traffic Sign
cool mirrors

Cons:
stickers!
road barrier kind of wobbly
special parts, especially at bucket
yellow parts are sometimes more orange, sometimes more yellow

Overall, I like the dump trucks of the 80's better. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2009-12-27T23:57:25.107Z","Do Not Dump This Dump Truck","Almost perfect, this fine medium set has some cons of it's own.
Box : 5/5
The Dump Truck is well photographed here, with tire tracks effect, and city skyline background.

Instructions : 5/5
Just a simple as-is instructions, nothing new and nothing special.

Building : 5/5
I had a really sweet time building the Dump Truck. This set combines System and a little bit Technic. But, it's pretty much ruined by the appearance of stickers.

Playability : 5/5
Impressive. You can load and drop the big stones from the truck, and maybe create a scene of ""accident"" where the stones drop on the driver (devilish grin)

Compability With Price : 3/5
This is the greatest setback in this set. Priced at IDR 400,000 (equal to US$ 42,55), this truck is greatly overpriced. Even when I buy it for a 20%+10% discount, it is still quite expensive.

Overall : 4/5
Very good set, highly detailed, and quite similar to real-life dump truck, this is a set not to be missed. For you US dwellers, never miss a chance to buy this one, it's pretty cheap for you. Non-US dwellers, the really expensive price may be a huge con for this set, but it's still great!

Pros :
2 stones
Lots of accessories
a Minifig

Cons : 
Expensive

"lotographia","2009-04-23T22:53:52.903Z","Nice accessories","What impresses me about this set is the amount of extra stuff that comes with it. Two boulders, two cones, a shovel, a traffic sign and a fence. Most sets just come with a vehicle and a minifig and maybe one accessory but that's it. The front-end loader, for example, doesn't have anything to front-end load. The small builder set with the concrete mixer doesn't come with a shovel.

So that's why I'm giving this set five stars. I also like the way the truck pivots in the middle, but all construction vehicles have that ability to steer. There are stickers, but you don't have to apply stickers if you don't want to - I really don't understand why people don't like them.

In the end, this is one of the few sets that enables you to make a story by itself.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"aplbomr79","2009-12-30T02:10:57.903Z","Decent Dump Truck...","This is a pretty good set.  The boulders were a nice touch.  This set is a good addition to the Construction Series.

Pros:
1. It is realistic in its looks
2. Cab is very well built with great access for Mini-fig
3. The tires are very rugged and allow the machine to move with ease.
4. The lighting is adequate for this model.
5. Most of the truck is well constructed.

Cons:
1. The Dump falls off easily.  It should have been better secured.
2. There is no place to carry the shovel or the cones.
3. The Dump should include some 'teeth' on the back end to help secure the loose boulders.

Overall this is a decent model.  I have outfitted mine with a clasp that carries the shovel... still don't know how to carry the cones.  I also placed a couple of 1x triangles at the rear of the Dump to better carry the boulders.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"av8r1973","2011-02-12T01:40:09.39Z","Great looking heavy-duty dump for the construction yard - don't miss this one","<div>After looking at my City Construction set (7633) and the wonderful crane and small excavator that came with it, my idea for a large construction section to my city came to mind. &nbsp;First, the front loader (7630) made its appearance on the scene. &nbsp;Then, I needed something for it to transfer cargo (bricks) to. &nbsp;In comes this heavy-duty dump truck. &nbsp;Just like the rock dumps seen in large construction sites, this is a beautiful example with a hinged joint in the middle for steering for better maneuverability.</div><div><br></div><div>The color scheme goes well with the remainder of the construction subtheme, so well done LEGO. &nbsp;Sticker use is minimal and most go on the accessories. &nbsp;Accessories? &nbsp;Yes, a lot! &nbsp;Shovel, boulders, barricade and a warning sign. &nbsp;Not sure why a dump driver came with a shovel, but I am not complaining. &nbsp;As SRoode wrote in his review, I am not sure why the small orange lights weren't included for the top of the barricade like the other sets do. &nbsp;It would add more to the uniformity.</div><div><br></div><div>This set was really a lot of fun to build. &nbsp;With some great SNOT techniques not seen in most models, it was unique. &nbsp;The joint that allows the bed to dump is nicely designed, but should have used another two or four lugs to make a better connection. &nbsp;It falls off unless you dump very carefully. &nbsp;Lots of Technic components make it unique, too. &nbsp;The instructions are simple enough to follow - my 5yo daughter built it with no problem.</div><div><br></div><div>The only drawback is that I found my loader bucket doesn't hinge enough to allow loading of this truck since it's so high. &nbsp;It's not really a problem for this kit, but is something that LEGO should be considering when creating the subtheme.</div><div><br></div><div>Since we found it after it went out of production, the price was considerably over original retail price, but I am glad we have it. &nbsp;A few more unopened boxes in my living room will soon complete my construction area. &nbsp;:)</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Bram","2011-04-27T07:08:23.263Z","A tip for stronger hinge.","Anyway, since there are already many reviews on this, I thought about posting a tip which I came up earlier to make the hinge on the bed chassis stronger while retaining the original tilting capability. While others have complained about the bed which comes off easily, I personally haven't had that problem, well because I mostly display my Lego set, being a 'sensible' AFOL. :) But I do play with it when my wife isn't around hahaha..<br><br>Anyway here it is:<br><br><span>[img]http://i256.photobucket.com/albums/hh164/Out_Of_Sight1572/dump1.jpg[/img]</span><br><br>Replace the stock hinges with these:<br>- 1x2 Brick with two Technic holes (x2)<br>- 1x2 brick (x1)<br>- 2x2 plate (x2)<br>- 2x4 tile (x1)<br><br>This should made the hinge on the chassis much sturdier since there are now 8 studs holding it instead of just 4. The downside is the bed will be moved 1/2 stud back. If you have these parts laying around, you should give it a try.<br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,4
