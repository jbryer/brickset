authentic details
lifting mechanism works well
crane rotates well
well designed

Cons:
tracks don't work
too many stickers!
too big for minifig scale
what is the house section good for?

Overall a nice set with some flaws but exciting playability.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"boeingroyale","2009-01-16T22:56:23.217Z","Nice crane to mod!","The set is really cool but as described in other reviews, it lacks on some minor details such as the back of the crane, a lot of ""open space"", tracks will not work on all surfaces.
But with some yellow and black pieces, you could do the rest!
The design is pretty good, but you have to create your own environment because the crane is really big.
It's just amazing how Lego went in those years; no more juniorized models.

"cys07gz","2009-03-10T04:43:01.64Z","Use 31 pieces to build each of the two tracks, and use both pulleys.","The instruction manual shows each of the tracks as having 30 pieces. The fit tension makes the moving of the tracks difficult, especially on flat slippery surfaces.  

Since there are two pieces left, try putting one into each of the two tracks. This makes the tracks a bit slack, but it helps in the moving.

Having 2 pulleys at the tip of the crane, and ending the wire by tying it at a pin, do not look good. What I did was let the wire goes through both pulleys, and then put both ends of the wire to the roller.  Although I do not know whether this actually happens in real cranes, this arrangment at least makes the finished product looks better.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jjr","2009-04-26T15:04:04.967Z","Epic crane!","Every year lego´s releasing some sets wich make them feel epic and a must have. IMO for every theme, like this year for star wars the AAT.  A few years back the XXL crane for city. and I think this one can be added to the list. on to the review

the box is like every lego box, oversized and much of space inside. 

we get a few seperate bags wich make the building easier

the build is simple and it had a few suprises for me. I like the fence thing, but what me really impressed are the crane pieces. overall a good build

the final result is a big crane, and it has really good looks. with some other construction vehicles it looks like a real construcion site

to play with this one is cool, ofcourse you can lift your parts, because that´s whay we have cranes. however like mentiuoned in all the other reviews, it tips over very fast. but there are 2 empty compartements wich can be filled with somekind of counterweight (wich don´t include the set)

price is always a problem with lego, but sometimes not with city sets. this one was at the toysrus 55 euro! 5 euro more than the lego shop. so I bhought it online with some windows from pick a brick. I would say it's moderatly priced

overall: I like this set, and it has some really cool featurers. I only think if lego fixed the tip over and counterweight problem it would be one of the best cranes in years. even with those problems I really like this set.

"paanjang16","2009-02-14T03:57:26.2Z","Almost like the real thing","When I first saw this set, I was instantly hooked and really wanted to buy it. Among the reasons is that it almost looks like a real crawler crane at construction site, although I felt that it should be carrying heavier stuff like beams or large concrete blocks used to perform load tests. The door and window piece doesn't seem to fit into this set and looked like an afterthought. 

The boom is in itself the main attraction of this set in addition to the hoisting hook, cab and large threads at the base. Like someone already mentioned, it is not 1 big specialized piece but instead several blocks connected by red technic rods. The boom design itself is almost similar to those used by real cranes whereby it is a square piece with an ""x"" inside the square for support. If you can afford another set, you can increase the boom height to make it even longer!

I hope that Lego continues to make sets like this with realistic parts. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cbowers","2009-11-17T15:36:34.45Z","Finally some real construction vehicles","This is definitely a great addition to anyone's construction sets. While it may be tough to transport through any town, this crane when on site can perform all of the duties needed. 

The treads on this thing are phenomenal. A great Idea. I plan on buying the dozer (its cousin). I aslo like the options they give with that panel wall. However, you would probably see this more in bridge construction. A great and very realistic set as are many of the newer construciton sets. I like how the boom is not just one piece. 

This is a great set and actually does take a decent amount of time to build. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"aplbomr","2009-12-29T03:27:52.607Z","One of the best construction...","This is truly a masterpiece!  This is so well thought out by the designers.  I enjoyed every minute of building this crane.  

Negatives:
 1. Felt a lot like a Technic build.

Positives:
1. It is very realistic:
  -The jib is very sturdy as it coupled with the boom.
  -They included a large Rotex gear to handle the pivoting motion of the base.
  -The hoist is very intricate, but versatile
2. The working tracks are a high point.
  -The are the stabilization of the rig.

The greatest thing that I have found about the new Lego sets from years past is that they include extra parts...  parts that are apt to be lost with much play.

If you are a fan of the Construction Sets, this is one that I would recommend you purchasing.  I bought mine after Christmas for $40.00 on a clearance sale at Walmart.

5 Stars on this one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AT_AT_Driver","2010-07-20T18:10:05.68Z","Start of a new collection","Until I bought this set, I was an Star Wars AFOL. Once a day I saw this <br>set in a store for just 30€ and recognized: this is a very good price <br>for a very cool set. After many years just interested for X-Wing <br>Fighters or AT-ATs, I suddenly was amazed by a Lego City Crane.<br>And this Vehicle is monstrous, on the box it just looks epic. As you <br>could see, this crane has to be driven outside the city for doing the <br>difficult jobs on difficult terrain.<br><br>You need much time to build it and it makes it lot of fun creating this <br>with its great heigth. Besides a good crane you get very useful parts <br>for creating objects with industrial design, for example a factory. In <br>addition you find minifigures with a normal face and clothing.<br><br>But this set is of course not perfect, it can only drive on carpet, <br>otherwise you have to move the tracks on your own and yes, it could <br>easily tip over. I have no problem with stickers but I also prefer Lego <br>System pieces instead of Lego Technic, many Technic parts aren't <br>necessary in this set. And this wall as an object to pull up has no use <br>when you don't build a house with own pieces. It would have been better <br>to integrate a cabin or something else in this set.<br>All in all I agree with the other reviewers before.<br><br>Finally I recommend this set for fans of Lego City or as a cool <br>stand-alone set. You get for an affordable price in relation a really <br>giant set. Under this condition I think it's the best construction-set <br>ever. I think I will sell my Star Wars Sets.",TRUE,4,4,5,4,5
"av8r1973","2011-06-06T11:18:44.873Z","Massive crane perfect for heavy lifts","After a short hiatus in kit purchases (not much interest in the 2011 space theme), we found this gem on sale for 50% off at Toyland in Taipei (Living Mall branch). &nbsp;That means it was slightly cheaper than retail in the States. &nbsp;Either way, it was a great deal at about USD$45.<div><br></div><div>First off, this was a big kit. &nbsp;Similar in size to the monster bulldozer in the City theme, but with much better scale. &nbsp;The height (about 1 1/2 feet) is impressive, and fairly realistic. &nbsp;These crawler cranes are pretty common here in Taipei and this one looks just like the real ones. &nbsp;I give TLG a thumbs up on the design here.</div><div><br></div><div>The build was fairly straight forward. &nbsp;A couple of tricky pieces that I had to do a couple of times, but not too bad. &nbsp;The new swivel mechanism (new for me, anyways) is really smooth. &nbsp;Besides the swivel, no other new parts for me.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the crane is very realistic, I was surprised there wasn't more complex rigging for the cable. A single strand out to the hook was kind of surprising since the real cranes have a lot more rigging.</div><div><br></div><div>One last drawback is that the upper securing point for the rods on the crane structure is only a two-lug surface. &nbsp;That can bear a lot of weight if I actually lift anything substantial with it, so I see it coming off pretty easily. &nbsp;I'll rig something up if it becomes an issue.</div><div><br></div><div>For such minor nits, this was a great value and makes an impressive addition to our City.</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,5
