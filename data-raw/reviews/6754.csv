"bsmarthen","2008-12-17T23:38:15.67Z","Nice set","This thing is huge! New tracks for this set. The build was easy went together very quickly. Engine compartment opens to show the fan blade and motor. The blade moves up and down . It can be left in the up position. No real new pieces except for the arms of the blade and the tracks. Love the new sets like this - it's going to be a good year to be a Lego fan. Must have set, maybe 2.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SRoode","2009-01-07T21:19:02.747Z","Almost Perfect","This is a very detailed set that was very fun to put together.  I love the treads on the dozer, and the attention to detail that Lego is seeming to provide in all of their new City sets.  That being said, there are one or two problems with the set.  When you try to lower the blade, the arms almost always pop off of the blade.  Also, the side cab extensions by the doors are a little loose, and rattle a bit.  Other than that, a very nice model.

Pros:
Big
Detailed
Nice tread movement when rolled on a carpet
Fun to build

Cons:
Poor arm attachment to the blade
Rattling side cab extensions",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"YellowedWhitePieces","2009-01-26T02:51:57.607Z","Not perfect, but close.","This is a great-looking set out of the box, but it needs a bit of reworking to be made a bit sturdier.  Using extra pieces from other sources, I moved the mounting bricks (at the sides of the vehicle) for the dozer blade arms forward by one stud.  Otherwise, the blade supports nearly brush the front of the tracks, behind the blade.

The blade itself is simply too weak as is.  I used two 4X6 plates to stiffen the back of the blade.  This required rebuilding the back of the blade mount quite a bit, but the larger plates do wonders for stiffening the blade.  I also used a pair of 1X10 plates to reinforce the backside of the blade at the top.  As mentioned previously, the lifting cylinders are a bit tight and sometimes come apart.  

Four of the six 1X1 transparent orange plates are put in some very strange places. Two are in the cab, invisible below the sloped brick/control panel piece.  Two more are outside, placed just below the rear of the engine, barely visible.  These four tiny plates are much too interesting and useful to be wasted there.  The two transparent orange 1X1 plates used at the front of the vehicle, below the blade lifting cylinders are actually somewhat okay there, but the entire area where the lift cylinders are mounted is simply too weak.  Some careful thinking and use of some narrow plates and sloped bricks will help to firm up this area.  

The cab should have a rear window.  The fan looks cool, but seems impractical, exposed to ""dust"" from a construction site.  :)  I also recommend adding some headlights mounted at the top of the engine housing.

As an AFOL/collector, I like to mod my kits to make them stronger and as realistic as the medium allows.  This dozer is an excellent base kit for doing just that!

"Pulpdiction","2009-04-05T03:12:21.263Z","I really like it","I've seen a fiar bit of criticism of this set but I really like it, the only thing for me that lets it down is that the cab is very weak and I think this was an easy fix by lego so they didn't need to release it like this.  Also I would have liked the cab roof to fold open so you can access the minifig easily, again and easy mod which I have done myself but lego could have done this.

I think is good value in terms of number of parts for your money, especially as this is on sale in Tesaco in the UK right now for Â£15, go grap yourselves a bargain.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Rad","2009-03-05T19:52:58.247Z","Nice set out of the box.","This set was fun to build, I love the proportions compared to the minifig. The tracks are cool and they move like the real thing.

My only gripes are the front vent, it doesn't really go all the way down and there is a gap at the bottom. A similar thing with the doors for the driver compartment.

Another thing is the upper arms for the blade are pretty flimsy and sometimes get stuck. The front window and sides of the driver compartment are also a bit flimsy.

Other than that, this is a nifty set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jjr","2009-04-05T05:54:15.373Z","really cool","I first didn't want to buy city sets anymore and focus more on starwars. however it's yellow color and industrial apperance made me want this set. and to make things even better it was 10 euro's cheaper (bhought it at toys XL a.k toysrus) so lets start

minifigs: you get one standard construcion worker, 

build: build is easy because of the separated bags. seometimes I made some small mistakes (I never did that before) but I saw them and could solve the problems. I dont know this has to do with the instruction or me...

play: the final product is a really oversized (in minifig scale) dozer. the enormous tracks are awsome and the front digger is cool. it has a lot of functions and it is fun to drive it around,

value to money: the set had a discount of 10 euro's wich made it 25 euro instead of 35. 25 is a very good price for this set. but 35 looks for me a little overpriced, but still the dozer is really worth it.

"mattressnz","2009-07-18T21:27:35.81Z","Almost a great set.","   The build was great, although with this set, and other recent sets, it seems Lego have tried to 'dumb down' the instructions. There are over 100 steps in the book, a lot  of which reqiure the addition of only one part. Also, the numbered bags seem a bit unnecessary, there are only 352 pieces. My 7 year-old opened all the bags, dumped the pieces in a pile on the table then built the dozer using every 3rd or 4th step.

    As other reviews have mentioned, the cab and blade require strengthening, which is easily done. A big let-down for me was the absence of rippers on the back, a must for a dozer this size I reckon! However there is plenty of room at the back and it took me about 20 minutes to correct this oversight and add a winch as well.

    Those gripes aside, I would still highly recommend this set, and it looks great on the back of my transporter 5590.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-05-19T19:27:58.107Z","Hugely HUGE!","Forget simply clearing away dirt, this monster is big enough to demolish BUILDINGS! The blade is larger than some buildings and vehicles in my city! Imagine what would happen if this dozer fell into the wrong hands. Anyways, to start small, the set comes with a minifigure and a fence with red stripes and lights. When you put the fence stickers on, you gotta be careful the force applied to put the sticker on doesn't bend the fence, because it can bend too easily. Overall, the dozer is about 20 studs wide and 14 studs high, like I said, huge. It cannot make 90 degree turns on conventional road plates. The blade, specifically, is 20 studs wide and about 10 studs high, enough to level ANYTHING that gets in its way. The blade can move up and down, a system of ""hydraulic pumps"" allows this. However, the grey axels (circular) slip out of the cylinders way too easily, but this can be fixed by replacing them with Technic axels (the ones shaped like a cross). Also, sometimes the blade is uneven when it raises/lowers. To solve this, you have to use your thumb to hold on to the 1x6 grey plate right above the fan) and use the rest of your fingers to slowly and carefully lift or push down the special yellow beams attached to the sides of the blade and vehicle. This way, the blade won't fall off, and it will be easier to raise/lower the blade. It's been a long time since I saw doors on vehicles, so this is another good thing. The caterpillar tracks work very well; they work on almost any surface and make a realistic grinding sound. There are a total of 58 track pieces, 29 for each caterpillar track. There is a fan on the front, covered by a ventilated flap. The cab has a COMPUTER inside with levers. Overall great set great price, and again, it's huge! You will be impressed if you get this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"HQuiff","2009-08-25T07:17:59.233Z","The Most Monstrous Machine In LEGO City - Or LEGO Town","Intro-
Combined with a sharp spiky engine cooler, and a huge front bucket, this thing is unstoppable. It's heavy duty treads (28 single clip-on tracks on each side) make it run practically everywhere. This... is the thing most likely to catch my eye on a LEGO City Construction display!

I received this just yesterday (The 24th of August 09') as a present from my Aunt. And seriously... this thing just towers over every other vehicle on the street, or on the roads! That said, it doesn't work very well on the flat roads you can get for your town. It works better on uneven surfaces like beds and carpets, however it still is able to run across flat surfaces (Preferably not roads).

The actual build took around 20 - 30 Minutes, mainly because I spilt my half cup of tea everywhere with a shifty move from my elbow. In any case, the build was fun, especially building the base and the engine. Except when coming closer to the end, I ran into some problems; some of the linking Technic parts wouldn't fit in! It wasn't a fault of the instructions, it was a mistake I had made of accidentally putting some pieces facing the wrong way. So my advice... just follow the instructions carefully.

The thing I will say about this set... is the remarkable amount of working functions, such as the opening doors near the cockpit, the door for the engine cooler being able to open so smoothly, the nice and crafty way the front bucket can slip up and down, and also the way you can lower the bottom bit of the bucket downwards completely. And finally, the easy way the roof on the cockpit can open so you can slip for Minifig in without having to fumble him around so that he can sit down!

Well, that's about all I think of. And if you have any unanswered questions, I highly advise you to actually get the set, as I recommend it any LEGO City collector or fan. Overall an 8.1/10, or 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"parchioso","2009-06-17T20:52:10.89Z","A minifigs compatible Dozer (when compared to the complex 8275 Bulldozer)","When you have a lot of debris on a construction site, you need a bulldozer to handle them, 7685 Dozer is a simplified 8275 Bulldozer, but still has a lot of details with a moderate size, good value for the price.

I have bought 8275 Motorized Bulldozer for almost an year, but as a complex Technic set, I can't find time to build it. This medium size dozer is easy to build (still has 9"" X 5""), and quite good looking really, though the playability is only average.

It has 58 pieces of Technic Chain Tread while 8275 Bulldozer has 84, at a low price it is a good source for getting these parts for other MOCs.

As others had pointed out, the arms and front portion are not very stable. But overall it is good looking and easy to build, and the pricing is fair, compared to 8275, this one is minifigs-compatible and does not take up too much space, so it is really worth buying.

Pros-
1. threads, hard to find in sets.
