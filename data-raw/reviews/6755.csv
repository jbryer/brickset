Pros:

*Boosts up your collection of mini-figs
*Fun things to build (including a boom box and a bench)

Cons:

*I'm not a big fan of stickers.

"jpmanalo","2009-01-15T18:52:44.903Z","The Town Minifig Pack Is Back!","Many people have been hoping to see the LEGO Group release a Town minifig pack for a long time, and the LEGO Group has delivered with set 8401. 
 
 
Features of set 8401 include: 
 
* Street Signs: 
Street signs are made up from stickers, (compare against set 5612 where the street sign is *printed* on the piece). 

Some people may like this, as it allows them to create their own stickers, whereas other people prefer printed pieces as it means they don't need to 'fiddle-around' with stickers. 

* Minifigs and Accessories: 
Good assortment of minifigs - set includes a male policeman, a delivery-man, a business-man, and one female 'fig. 

Fans of Classic-Space (SPACE!) will appreciate the torso design for the delivery-man, as it features a jacket with a Classic-Space logo. 
 
The minfig accessories include: 
    -- A black megaphone and walkie-talkie for the policeman 
    -- A brown briefcase for the business-man 
    -- A red hand-cart, a brown box (with lid), and a yellow cup for the delivery-man 
    -- A brick-built portable sound-system for the female minifig 

* Other items: 
A fire hydrant and a bench - nice little items to add to a town layout. 
 
 
In summary, fans of Town / City will really appreciate this set, and other LEGO enthusiasts will find elements within this set useful in their creations. 

As at 16 January 2009, this set retails in Australia for AUD $14.95 from Target, K-Mart, and Myer. LEGO Shop@Home has this set for AUD$14.99.

Girl with blond hair is really cool and I agree is rare minifing. All figures except cop are very nice, and I thing that this set could be even better if plan civilian was in the set instead of cop. There are already many sets with cops, but I`m giving highest rate 5+!

If I had, I'm quite sure I'd end up with a city composed entirely of police, fire and rescue vehicles and buildings with the occasional city maintenance vehicle or service station thrown in. And maybe a token civilian to be rescued or assisted by any of the above.

This year seems to be set to change that trend. There's a farm, a horse and trailer, a camper, a sports car, a bus and some shops. Finally! A lego city that actually looks like a city! To be exact, a city with surrounding farmland.

The civilian to policeman ratio in this set is what all lego should ideally be like - the police presence shouldn't completely overwhelm the society. Hopefully the lego company will start making a more proportionally realistic society from now on.

This is my first city set for the year, and it provides me with a mix of citizens, accessories and municipal features. I am happy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The girl is a nice addition with with her sleeveless top and blond hairdo. The policeman however is a dime a dozen, and one can get tired of too many of variations of these fellas.

"indykid","2009-08-06T20:12:02.59Z","Really Good","You may think I talk to good about every set I have, but that's because I've never been disappointed by LEGO. That sounded really cliche. But nevermind, I'm supposed to be talking about this great set. It's good for adding signs, benches and citizens to your LEGO town.

Minifigures: The majority of this set. There are four in all. Surfer girl, Delivery boy (even though he doesn't really look like a boy, he looks like a man; i guess delivering too many packages makes you age badly.), Guy in a suit, Police Man

Accessories: Boom box for surfer girl, Coffee Mug for Delivery Boy/Man, Brown briefcase for the guy in a suit, Radio and Megaphone for Police Man. 

City Accessories: Crate with red carrier, Bench, very similar to the bench in Cafe Corner but one of the planks has studs so the Minifigs sit more easily in it, Signs like the Crosswalk sign, Speed Limit Sign, and Street light sign, Street light, and Fire hydrant. 

Build: Easy Build. Very few pieces. You put together like 4 pieces and you're almost finished. that was a joke.

Playability: Tons of playability. 

Overall: 8.7/10. Could have come with a few more accessories or even people but it should have come with a car and/or a road plate. I still like this set and it is fun to add to the 'Camper' set to have a dance party BBQ. It's also very cheap for so many figures. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Exo_brick","2009-11-09T20:57:26.39Z","Great","I bought this set so I didn't have to have star wars guys as civilians. I like that it comes with four minifigs for $10. Time to break it down:

Section 1: People
      Subsection 1: Police Officer
            Not much new here. Just another police officer. This is my eighth officer.
      Good for a town with no police.
      Subsection 2:Girl
            A nice figure, with a good color scheme. The shirt is one I didn't have,
      so thats nice.
      Subsection 3: Delivery man
            This guy looks like a jerk. He looks like he'd be on a rocking chair
      saying ""You darn kids, get off my lawn!"" Always a welcome person, one who
      is in the delivery system.
      Subsection 4: Business man
            Nice fellow, seems good for a corperate worker.
Section 2: Items and signs
      Subsection 1: Items
            The bench is a nice addition. A fire hydrant is essential. The radio is
      awesome for a kid. The hand truck is great; you can never have enough.
      Subsection 2: Signs
            A few nice signs and the trafic light is cool.

Conclusion: A nice set great for boosting residents.

And it's a good addition to a LEGO Town or City for the variety of minifigures and elements to flesh out the streets and business of city life and people out and about.<br></p></div>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are in booklet form and follow LEGO's clear step-by-step illustrations. <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 60 pieces to this set, most of which lend themselves towards signs and various mini builds within the set.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are a total of four minifigures in this set. A delivery guy with a trolley, a gal with a radio, office worker on his way somewhere and a police officer. Now, personally, with the number of Police sets that come out and get done, I'd have changed out the police minifigure to another city type minifigure. Even a second female figure in this set.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>There's not much of a build to this set, as much of it is assembling the street signs and then small minibuilds for a Street Light, sidewalk bench, fire hydrant and a portable radio.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Still, while the set comes across as really simple, it's a great set for all of it's minibuilds with detailing out a larger LEGO City or Town.

<p>THE BUILD </p>
<p>Easily built in one or two minutes. You get a 13 (15 if you include the advert and parts list) page instruction book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PARTS</p>
<p>I was a little bit sad about that the&nbsp;signs&nbsp;that&nbsp;are NOT printed like&nbsp;the old ones did but im not going to moan. You get pieces to build a fire hydrant, bench, boombox or radio, police gear, trolly, box, the signs, a mug, briefcase or suitcase, traffic light and of course, 4 minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PLAYABILITY</p>
<p>I had to give it a three because with out a city, this set would go the way of the parts bin. If you are making a city, get this. If you have a city, get this. If you are making a city MOC, get this. If you don't collect city, don't get this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE MINIFIGURES</p>
<p>You get a women with a pig tail, a body with flowers on, used&nbsp;alot these days in city/town sets and plain dark blue legs.&nbsp;Also, a police officer with a police body and white cap. The head for the cop is that of uncle Vernon from 4728. The delivery boy (more like a man to me!) has tan legs, red coat with the&nbsp;space logo on and&nbsp;new&nbsp;baseball cap.

On top of that most stores in Canada have raised the price by one dollar compared to the 12.99$ price I paid for it last year. I can't understand that policy personally, in fact this set to me should have been 9.99$ for what you're getting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There aren't a lot of pieces in it, and what is there isn't much, basically you're using a lot of small pieces to build up the following items. A School Crossing sign, a Stoplight, A Warning Stoplight Ahead sign, a fire hydrant, a park/bus stop bench, a speed limit sign, a boom box for the female mini-figure. You also get a walkie talkie and megaphone for the police officer, a briefcase for the office worker, a little yellow mug (probably for coffee) for the deliveryman and one of those wheeled delivery thingies to hold the crate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all I can't hate this set, but I can't downright praise it either, considering that back in the 90's Mini-Figure collections involved the same sort of design, but cost considerably less I find that there should just be something more for the price I'm paying. True I am aware of inflation and such, but this set is still shelfwarming around because in my opinion it just costs too much for what you're getting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong though, if you want to populate your LEGO City with more people it's a must have set, in fact this set plus City Corner would look pretty good together I'd bet (not having obtained that set I can't say 100% for certain.) and if you did get it on sale or during one of the infamous buy one get one deals than great. But if you are going to buy it at least buy a few other actual sets from the City theme to go with it, as a stand alone set I think we AFOLs appreciate it more for the nostalgia of purchasing a Mini-Figure collection again.

"WoutStopmotion","2014-05-19T13:04:59.85Z","Generic Stuff","<p>I got this set quite a while ago because i wanted some parts included in it.<br />
<br />
<b>Building Experience</b><br />
<br />
Not a lot of it. You get to build up a few figures and some very simple accessories. I don&#39;t really think there&#39;s anything else i can say about building.<br />
<br />
<b>Parts</b><br />
<br />
Let&#39;s talk about the figures. I really wanted the head of the policeman, so that&#39;s a main reason why i got this set. The other figure parts... meh. They&#39;re your typical City minifigs, which you can expect, but generally they&#39;re kinda boring. And, mine were <em>very</em> badly printed. Some of the faces were overly contrasted, and some torsos aswell. Besides that you also get accessories, which include a bench, boombox, fire hydrant and some other stuff. The parts aren&#39;t very special, and to top it you also need to sticker the signs. Eww.</p>

<p><b>Playability</b><br />
<br />
I don&#39;t see a lot of playability, but if you&#39;d build a city, you could add these minifigs and signs to them to play. That&#39;s it, really.<br />
<br />
<b>Value for Money</b><br />
<br />
The price seems just a bit too high for the pieces you get, but besides that i think it&#39;s OK.</p>

<h4><b>Overall Rating</b></h4>

<p>This set is very simple and doesn&#39;t contain a lot, unless you like minifigs and stickers. And there&#39;s plenty of people that like those, so for them, that&#39;s why this set gets the middle rating from me, a three.</p>
