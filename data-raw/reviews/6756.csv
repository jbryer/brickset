A straight forward build, but the final model offers lots of opportunity for modification & could also easily act as the basis for a number of different construction vehicle models.

A very nice set, and an excellent addition to the construction theme

"DarthMunich","2009-02-20T04:53:49.967Z","Fantastic set","It's the first single-drum roller in Lego history, and was the missing part in every construction site. It is well designed, works perfectly even on smooth surfaces. I love this set!

Pros:
great design
works well
two minifigs + construction equipment
fun to build

Cons:
STICKERS!
lot's of special parts
maybe a litte bit too big for minifig-scale

But overall a must-have!

Buy it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"toddthuma","2009-08-26T14:26:06.92Z","Great set for Play and Parts!","I recently purchased and assembled this model for a display at a convention and was very pleased with the set. I did obtain the set at a discount from a major big box retailer (the blue one), but why it was being discounted I could not tell you. 

The set assembles quickly and is well organized into numbered poly-bags. I was able to hand it off to my children to play with it in under 30 minutes. The single-drum roller remains together fairly well with a reasonable amount of play. Having two minifigs was a bonus too and enable more interaction to go on between my two boys.

Having 5 of the Wheel Spoked 7 x 7 x 2 & 2/3 (part 55817) is originally why I purchased the set to become part of another MOC. I could easily see how two of the 7746 sets could be adapted to produce a Double-Drum Roller or perhaps remove the Single-Drum and replace with another front-end attachment to become another piece of construction equipment.

I highly recommend adding this to your layout or construction team.

"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-05-10T20:30:06.187Z","An interesting case","This steam roller is the only one lego ever made, I think. Anyway, it's quite good. The steam roller has one drum and balloon tires at the back. The drum is made of 5 unique wheel pieces, finished with yellow hexagonal hub caps on either side of the drum. The drum rotates very well, it's not stiff and won't jam. The cab has a special window piece, inside is a chair and steering wheel. The roof, however, is kind of flimsy, and so are the 4 vanity mirrors, which can break or be moved around very easily. The mudguard wheel frames for the balloon tires look very nice. The rear of the vehicle is streamlined, with tail and signal lights. The drum can pivot side to side as well. There are two 2x6 yellow bricks just above the drum holder, and they separate outwards when a downward force is applied to the vehicle. This can be fixed by adding a 2x4 plate to connect the bricks together so they don't separate. However, this is an obstruction to the drum's pivoting ability. But you decide whether to reinforce the 2x6 bricks, or have the drum pivot, that's not my choice. The balloon tire hub caps are hard to put in, what I did was force the hub cap into the tire as much as possible, then when it doesn't go in anymore, I stretched the inner lips of the tire into the corresponding grooves on the hub cap. When there are no gaps between the inner rim of the tire and the outer edge of the hub cap, you put it in properly. Set also includes 2 construction workers, a shovel, broom, 2 traffic cones and a hand steamer.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lotographia","2009-05-20T17:42:53.543Z","My roadwork team is complete.","This set is good but... not great. If you try pushing it forward on a flat surface the indentations on the roller get stuck. Since I only ever build my lego on flat surfaces this is a bit irritating. Also, the pivot in the middle doesn't turn freely, it clicks from place to place, so you can't 'steer' it in a realistic manner. Because of these, the toy works better as a model than as a toy.

On the plus side, this set comes with two minifigs, two traffic cones, some minifig tools and a kind of interestingly designed roadwork tool thingy. All you really needed with the set was the vehicle with one minifig, so all these extras are a nice bonus.

I put this set with the dump truck and the front-end loader to make a fairly realistic road-work team.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-12-29T17:14:14.327Z","Better as a Display Piece than a Working Model…","I picked this set up today from my local Argos as it was in the sale; it was reduced to £13.32 from £21.49 so for that price I thought it was a good deal.   I have found myself getting more into the Construction line recently; I think I am only two away from having the full compliment!

The set went together easily enough; the build is organised into four separate bags for ease of construction.   The manual was interesting and easy to follow.   I put the set together this evening and spent a pleasant half hour doing so.   

The set is good, but I don’t think it is great, I am glad I bought it in the sale and didn’t pay full price for it.   As with all of my sets, they are used as display models not toys, and where this set is concerned I think it works much better as a display piece than a working model, or toy.   I am not sure what a five year old would make of this set or how long it would remain together!

The roller is presented in the same yellow, grey and black colour scheme found throughout the Construction line.   The huge drum is massive!   This is attached to the rest of the vehicle by way of a symmetrical frame which ‘hugs’ the drum.   This marries up to a pivoting bracket which allows the whole vehicle to move.  The move is not smooth, but more ‘jerky’ than I was expecting also dependent on the surface the drum doesn’t roll so freely either.   The cab and engine area is well detailed and features a small cab which is accessed by climbing three steps which are mounted to the side of the vehicle.   The cab features four independent fully adjustable wing mirrors, two of which are decorated by amber lights.   There are also high-mounted amber beacons and spreader lights on a tilting bracket which overlook the drum.   The engine area is fully enclosed and is decorated with vents and an exhaust pipe.   The rear bumper features warning chevrons and a lighting panel which combines brake lights and indicators.

The two minifigs are presented in their orange work suits along with red hard hats.   There is also a jackhammer which can be operated by one of the minifig while the other drives the machine.   There is also a frame with mounting points for a shovel and a brush (both supplied) and two warning lights which can be placed at the side of the work zone on the road.

I don’t mean to sound like I am not glad to have this set in my collection, it is a very original set for Lego, but I think it could have benefitted from a little more thought at the design stage so that certain niggles (the turn of the drum, the roller not gripping all surfaces and the ‘loose’ fitting of the turning bracket meaning that the two sections of the model ‘fall into themselves’) were eliminated.   All that said, it was a great price and it does contain many new and unique parts, I am sure it will generate some discussion when I take it to the office in January and place it on my desk.

I think an interesting diorama could be made using this set and others in the same line, buy it and try it for yourselves…",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
