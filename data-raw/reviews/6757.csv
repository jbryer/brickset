"Loganwan","2009-01-23T19:00:22.467Z","Can't wait for more","If this is what the rest of the farm equipment is going to look like, I am really excited.

This is a really well designed vehicle.   It looks very accurate to a real modern tractor, with the great function of a scoop on the back.  Hopefully we will see some cows that need a little cleaning up after.

The only area that I would say is lacking is the fact that you have to dismantle the top and one of the windows in order to get the driver in.  It is only a minor problem that is even smaller when looking at the great design over all.

It is going to be a great workhorse for the farm sets to come.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I love these new stubby windscreens--this comes with two. This is the most ""Airtight"" cockpit I've seen in ages. Those Mars Mission guys wish they had it this good.

"jamal_lts","2009-07-20T07:27:37.03Z","Lets be carrying the load guys!! ","This set has lots of playability. The back of the tractor has a loader which is very well designed. It doesn't droop down easily when there's weight on it. 

The size of the model is just right. Size for my CITY vehicles are very important to me. 

The best part is you can have the tractor be fitted with other components like a front loader bucket or a tow bed for other functions of a tractor.

"_obelix_","2009-04-23T21:05:41.827Z","Fantastic little set!","This is the first of the new sets that i bought in 2009, and i have to say it is great. The construction of this little tractor is a simple job, but that doesn't diminish its awesomeness one bit. Its true to the form of a true tractor with only of small number of technic elements, which, by the way, are nicely put into construction so you almost don't see them in the final stage. The construction is very sturdy built, which is also true to the realistic portrait of a real tractor. A farmer figure is nice, and his shovel is a bonus. There are only three stickers for this set, which are very small, and are easy to put on right.

All in all set with a pure 5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lotographia","2009-03-25T05:02:40.593Z","John Brick.","Okay, while I'm not particularly excited by the idea that it's just a tractor... I do have to acknowledge that it's a marvellous little tractor. And while farms themselves do not interest me... I'm glad that lego are working on a theme that isn't just police, firemen or emergency rescue. I'd rather have a tractor than any number of police cars and fire trucks - it evokes a kind of peaceful rural scene rather than a hectic dangerous inner city adventure.

For some reason the back of this tractor has a connection to attach trailers too, I'm not sure what you'd put there or how you'd get it around the big scoop. It's a nice touch though, whatever you're supposed to do with it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2009-12-01T07:47:15.5Z","A VERY GOOD CASE","This is a cracking little set which reminds me of a Case tractor. It really looks the part and comes with a working lifting carrier at the rear as well as a towing point. The wheels and tyres on the rear axle looked like new parts to me so these will be good for other models where the wide large wheel/tyre combo is not appropriate. The farm minifig is good too – especially the overalls. I have mine driving rather than holding the shovel it comes with – which is in the spares box.

My only slight criticism is that some of the parts could have been in better colours for even more realism. Again I have modified the set, mainly just changing colours and adding mirrors and an exhaust stack/silencer brick, which I feel, enhances an already great set.

Price is about right in my view, but you can get something off by buying it in Tesco.

Based on my evaluating criteria of looks/appearance, minifigs, working features/playability and price this has to rate a maximum score and if you read any of my previous reviews you will see I do not give these out lightly.

I bought this to compliment the Combine Harvester 7636, which has now been modified from the set. I need to make a grain trailer to go with the tractor, but have not done this yet. If not already there they should all appear on Brickshelf when I get time.

"Shadow_Crawler","2009-12-27T23:45:34.013Z","Highly Appreciated","LEGO has made another excellent set at a reasonable price.
Box : 5/5
Very interesting CGI pic of the tractor and the farmer with his shovel. At the top is the farmer with the 1:1 scale, rightside is the choking hazard blah blah blah that nobody ever reads. Leftside is a panoramic view of the front picture, and backward contains 3 images about the tractor. I guess you already know what's at the bottom part of the box.

Instructions : 4/5
Just standard instructions booklet, nothing new.

Building : 5/5
Surprisingly, this set is a great fun to build, despite it's small size. Also, I love how LEGO designed the ""cockpit"" for the farmer.

Playability : 4/5
Nothing special, you just move tractor here and there, lower and rise the back compartment. However, it would be great if you have a complete Farm collection.

Compare With Price : 5/5
In Indonesia, it's priced for IDR 196,900 which is equal to US$ 20,95. This is a pretty fair price (if not compared to the US price). I give this section a five because I got this set for a 15%+10% discount at a local LEGO fair.

Overall : 5/5
Great details, nice minifig, and 2 big tires really make up some reasons for you to buy this one. But, the lack of more accesories is a little setback. Overall, a fine little set to buy and play!

Pros : 
Rare Minifig
Detailed Tractor
2 Big Tires
A Shovel

Cons :
Should have more accesories (maybe scythe or other farming stuff)

New pieces : None
Unique pieces : 2 big tires and 2 big velg.

"Night_City_Dream","2009-10-15T03:56:36.403Z","Simply excellent","I've bought all the Farm sets and I think this set is the best.

It comes at a fair price and a fair box - not very big, which I appreciate.

The set has only 1 minifig but it's enough for such size of set. The man torso is new, and very nice. It has enough accessories, in my opinion.

The tractor itself is excellent. It is so well designed that I really think absence of doors is unnoticeable! It looks veru much like a real tractor. And, what is important to me personally is that it is moderately scaled and fits easily to the Lego City System.

There is one small disadvantage - the basket often comes off but I don't think it's so eye-catching.

So, 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-12-28T05:12:18.89Z","A Very Rugged Machine…","After purchasing and building the 4WD with Horse Trailer (7635) and reviewing it here on Brickset, I closed my review by stating that I wouldn’t be expanding the Farm line in my collection … until I walked through Argos on Boxing Day and saw a basket full of these tractors with a small discount applied.   I am really glad I picked one of these up as it really is a great set; I am very impressed with how realistic it is.   The other sets in this series do not interest me so I think I can safely say that this will close my Farm collection, unless another tractor is released!

Construction was a very pleasant 20 minutes, accurately applying the decals and making sure the build was as recommended in the manual.   The tractor is presented in a bright red colour scheme; it looks like it has just come out of the showroom, if showrooms for agricultural equipment exist?!   The chassis area is a mixture of black and grey parts along with white wheels and deep-tread tyres.   Attached to the sides of the tractor are vents, vertical exhaust pipe and steps allowing ‘access’ to the cab.   The bonnet is a simple curved arrangement which meets the windscreen on the all-transparent cab.   Two simple headlights are provided as are two rear lights in red.   The cab area is very small and seats just one minifig (he is supplied) running alongside the cab are the red wheel arches.   Behind the cab a towing bracket is provided and either side of this are the two brackets which allow the grey bucket / scoop to move in various ways (up and down and at various angles) presumably to allow feed to be spread or for the moving of items around the farm.   

The minifig wears green overalls and a red sweater; he also has a blue baseball cap on and looks to be happy in his job.   He comes with a shovel; unfortunately there is no bracket on the tractor to hold this so it has gone into the spares box.   

I think it’s a pity that to gain access to the cab the rear windscreen and roof have to be removed, perhaps the tractor could have been open-backed as many tractors are?   But that is the only negative aspect of the set in my opinion, the decals are small and discreet and do not cross more than one brick although I doubt I’ll be dismantling this set for a long time.  I am even toying with buying a second set and ‘weathering’ it to make it look like it has been in use for some time!

For the price its a great buy; I got mine from Argos where it was slightly reduced, however I have ordered the Single Drum Roller also from Argos as that is on 'proper' sale.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
