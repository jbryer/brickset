"dhaas06","2008-11-16T01:45:12.623Z","Great looking set!","I just picked this up today from my local Toys R Us. It was a bit overpriced at $24.99, but who cares? The 2009 sets are here!

Besides the price, this set is wonderful. Of course, like most sets these days, there's a sticker sheet. However, I found all of the stickers useful, and they definitely add to the look of the set. (at least none of them cover multiple pieces!)

The design of the truck is a nice change of pace from the average Lego vehicle, and the trailer is just right. Round it off with two great figures, and this set is the perfect compliment to any town scene. 

I would definitely recommend this new set. 2009 on!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"wallybreit","2008-11-19T01:11:01.967Z","Just found it at TRU today!","I've been looking forward to the new LEGO City farm sets since they were announced, and this first one to show up at my local TRU did not disappoint!

I like the open interior of the SUV (it is more realistic than cars with room for only one minifig).  And like another reviewer mentioned, the stickers add to the great look of the set.

The white half- and quarter-arch pieces that make up the trailer are pretty rare.  I might pick up another one just for those pieces.

Top it off with two great minifigs and we have ourselves a winner!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mynameistristan","2009-04-06T11:40:48.937Z","Fantastic, and versatile","This set had me saying 'wow' over and over, as I built it. It incorporates some of those new bricks, the curve slope over the trailer bar, for example, but the majority of these actually seem classic Lego, only with innovation. The design is amazing, so many excellent ideas, such as the front bumper - looking at the box, I couldn't think what sort of brick would be used, but was amazed when I put it together. It's a really nice car; replacing the headlights with blue ones and the red stripe with a black one would give a really nice security vehicle. Two of these Range Rovers and a police car, with a bike or two would make a fantastic 'VIP transport' set, but I think that would feel somewhat out of place in Lego's range, somehow.

The great pieces, the versatility, the quality of the design make this model that really deserves five stars. My one petty complaint would be the lack of storage for the fence.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zrath","2008-11-19T21:37:37.077Z","Range Rover!","I'll be honest. The two main reasons I picked this set up are:
1) the 4WD is awesome-looking and it reminds me of the classic Range Rover!
2) the white pieces making up the trailer will be useful for starship design!
It's quite a nice set in itself, though.
I'm a bit disappointed at how the trailer's tailgate is not levelled or smoothed on the inside, the area the horse would walk on.
And the driver has his left arm in the air when sitting at the wheel because the 4WD's beltline is so high.
And the wheels look a bit small.
But these are minor quibbles.
I really like the design of the 4WD overall; the curved chin with fog lamps under the bumper; the vertically rounded rear-end with widely-spaced taillights; the red trim; the roof rack; the way the hood merges with the headlights and, heck, with the whole front facia.
This set has taught me a few new design tricks.
And that is always a good thing.

"Lmcfalcon12","2008-12-08T09:58:25.25Z","One of the coolest SUVs Lego Has Made","This is a really cool set. It comes with 2 minifigures, a horse, an SUV and a trailer. The detail on the SUV is very good; roof rack and fog lights and turn signal lights. I was a little surprised that it was about $25 for only 176 pieces, but the trailer cabin is made of 6  individual solid pieces. Its definitely a must have and I can't wait for the rest of the farm sets to be released.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lotographia","2009-03-25T04:30:34.39Z","Five and a half stars.","My only regret is that I only have five stars to give to this set. I've given a lot of other sets five stars already, and this surpasses all of them.

If this site allowed people to 'favorite' their favorite lego sets, this would be one of them. Note to site creators: add a 'favorite sets' function.

If I were to nitpick, I'd say that two of the images in the instruction manual were the wrong way around, and in reality the trailer wouldn't have the same number plate as the car... but these are such insanely minor details they're not even going to make a dent on the six stars I'm going to imaginarily give this set.

I just wish the two people could sit side by side in the car, though, but the only way you can do that at the moment would be to add the vintage two-seat brick that goes in a lot of 'vintage' lego cars... and that would be completely out of place in this set.

Note to lego creators: design a two-seater brick that would fit in 'modern' lego cars. That would be amazingly awesome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I changed the yellow brick that holds the front of the truck on and put a 2x2 plate with a lego 2x2 engine with the blower on top. and added a stick shift in the inside.

First of all, You have a doting father taking his daughter to the gymkhana on a saturday morning. Then you know exactly where he's going after!! That's right, he's taking that ""Discovery"" off-roading! Who'd have thought you could have made a proper looking ""Disco"" with a handful of bits? The whole set is brilliant.

I LOVE the Paradisa window/white corner dome pieces! When, oh when will LEGO bring them back in transparent colors--these things make the COOLEST windows. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jcilkmfoster","2009-08-25T08:08:46.45Z","Worth the Price of Admission (albeit an expensive admission)","I posted a review of this set (my first review, regrettably) before we opened it.  Tragic at worst, overzealous at best.

At any rate, we have since opened it, built it, ""stickered"" it, and played with it.  

Here's what I have for you all:

Pros:

Fun build - particularly for the indicated age range (5-12)
Challenging build (again, for the indicated age range - my seven year old daughter loved to build it the first time and a few weeks later took it apart and rebuilt it)

Another plus: the truck is just plain cool.  Way out of the norm for any other City-themed cars that I've seen.  Besides, what LEGO city doesn't need a sweet SUV on it's roads?

Playability - great.  My children (9, 7, 6, 4) all love it.

Parts - great set if you're just looking for parts

Stickers - I normally can't understand TLG's relatively new insistence upon using stickers instead of printing directly to the elements.  Having said that, this set made it (at least partially) clear: if you don't want to build the truck and trailer, you're stuck with pieces with horse pictures on them.  Horse pictures don't really work with most other genres.  So, you have options, and that's a plus.  

All in all, this is a great set BUT the price tag is a bit on the steep side ($22.99US - 176 pieces?  Really?).  I'm sure the steeper price is due to some of the elements being on the bigger side (fence, horse, bigger elements for the trailer, etc).

Hope this helps!

"Night_City_Dream","2009-10-15T03:40:39.687Z","Sometimes one should be moderate","This set is interesting as in 2009 it restarts a rural life which was so popular in the 90s. However, some things about this set seem to me excessive. But I'll start with positive aspects.

The set has 2 minifigs. It's not that much but still more that, for example, there are in the 7631.
The set has a horse. This is probably the first Horse in LEGO CITY (not Town or World City). Fine.
The 4WD really looks like the Range Rover and this woks to its advantage. I personnally dislike this car but I like the way it was reproduced by Lego. The colour scheme is nice, too. The trailer is excellent.
I don't like much that the 4WD being so huge, can't normally contain minifigs inside.

However, the set is not as good as it might seem:
- it has only 176 pieces.
- it has a very big box
and as a result,
- it is much overpriced.

Moreover, I don't like that the 4WD is 6 studs wide. Yes, it should be if we try to be accurate but this fact harms the whole System. LEGO CITY system. If so, we have to build trucks that are 8 studs wide and I really don't think it's worth doing.

So, I give this set only 3.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-10-02T08:10:46.45Z","I’m Really Not Sure About This One…","I’ve recently picked up a few of the later City sets (7686, 7990, 7991) and out of them all this is my least favourite.   I looked at Argos for this (£13.99) but it was constantly out of stock, but I found mine in John Lewis at the Trafford Centre for £9.99!   For that price I think the set is OK but if I had paid full price for it I would have felt a little cheated.

Essentially there is nothing wrong with the concept of the set; I just think it could have been done better.   I must admit I was in two-minds about returning mine as some of the decals (stickers) seem discoloured and some of the parts didn’t fit as snugly as I would have hoped.   The set is divided into 2 main parts:

The Jeep:

The jeeps looks OK in my opinion, I am not sure if it is based on a production car at all, it doesn’t look much like the current models offered by Toyota, Land Rover etc.   It also looks unfinished; there are two minifigs with the set but only one seat!   There is room in the rear of the jeep for the second minifig to sit, but this involves removing the cab roof and then the roof next to that, which results in the roof rack and associated ‘vents’ coming off!   There is no dashboard or control console.   The wheel arches seem a little high in comparison with the wheels and tyres and the rear number plate is attached to a sloping panel which faces down towards the ground!   The mirrors could also have been better.   It is also rare to find a jeep without a spare wheel on the tailgate.   I like the grill and provision of ‘spot lights’ low down, but if this jeep is supposed to be representative of the high-end Range Rovers etc, why not offer those Xenon headlights (blue headlamps)?!   I like the colour scheme of the jeep and the use of the transparent panels, the roof rack area is also good.

The Horsebox:

The horsebox is very, very basic and although it is provided to do a job, I think it takes minimalism too far!   There is no dedicated storage area for tools, riding equipment or provisions (not that any of these items are provided with the set).   Also, horseboxes usually have a side door for personnel access to the box, this does not, nor are there any windows in the box.   Additionally, every horsebox I have seen comes with a spare wheel usually under a cover, this does not.   The rear ramp / door is OK but doesn’t make a good contact with the sides of the box when it is in the closed position.   There is also a roof-mounted floodlight which doesn’t seem to fit in somehow.   Lastly, there is no undercarriage at the front of the trailer, and although the trailer has two axles and does stand alone, it looks odd when disconnected from the jeep.

The set also comes with two minifigs; these are quite attractive and fit the scheme of the set well.   The one piece of fencing and the horse are also fine.

This is the first and only Farm set in my collection, the rest of the series doesn’t interest me so I won’t be expanding this line at all, I’m glad I got this set while it is available but having built it once and already dismantled it, it’ll probably remain boxed for a long time to come.   

It has however, provided me with the inspiration to build a proper coach built horsebox complete with office, over-cab sleeping area and two stables – so something good came of the purchase.

There were some nifty show stoppers in here for me- construction worker helmet in black, those weird curvy pieces (<a href=""http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/2571"">http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/2571</a>), a fence, and the real show stopper, a horse with the saddle.

The SUV is very cool and is one of my favorite LEGO vehicles. The horseback trailer is also quite cool with the white curvy pieces, and a little something to keep the horse inside. There's also a fence. =)</p><p>I also discovered a nifty little technique to change the SUV to a truck. Remove the roof and all the glass (except the windshield) and those leftover black slopes. Then put the black tile with the red and grey on the back. Cool eh?</p><p><br></p><p>Anyway, the set is very cool, it has a very nice price, and it's a fun set too. Overall, I recommend.
