"lego_vally","2009-01-24T16:28:51.187Z","Highly recommend getting","This set has huge playability with three mini figures. With a huge silo that you can fill up with all your 1x1 round plates that are yellow, brown and tan. Once you have done that you can empty them all into the trailer. 

Store all your hay in the loft and when you need hay lower it with the pulley. Also you can lift up the roof for easy access.

The stables are big enough to fit one cow and one person to milk the cows.

The tractor and trailer look really good from all angles. The sides and the back of the trailer can open to empty what ever you have put inside. It also tilts backwards.

The lawn mower is very well built because it just looks like a real one.

The new parts are the windscreens for the tractor and cows that can be male or female. There are a lot of old parts in new colours.

Bad things about this set are large parts; the tractor can just fit under the loft. Stickers. Tan and yellow looked lighter to me so it maybe hard to add to if you wanted to make it bigger. The roof of the tractor comes off too easily.

For my conclusion I have to say if you get this set you will not be disappointed.

"lotographia","2009-05-07T06:22:59.67Z","Future potential","My favourite thing about this set is that it isn't a police station, fire station, hospital, airport or train station. It's great to see a line that isn't based on something that 10-year-old boys are supposed to be in to. I'd really like to see a farming cottage to go with this set, but I can't see them expanding this line much in the future. What, apart from tractors, cows, barns and sheds, do you expect to find on a farm?

The vehicles are great. The tractor goes well with the other tractor and the combine harvester, they're even colour coded - red, green and blue, with a cute little yellow lawn mower. I like that the tractor in this set is like the big brother of  the other red tractor.

Unfortunately I can't bring myself to give it that many stars. It's just not that exciting. I'm not saying this just because it's a farm, I mean that everything is kind of... simple. Nothing is really very substantial, there aren't any walls holding things up, just pillars. Apart from the bird houses, I can't pick out any detail that really impresses me. The barn could have proper walls and doors. The cattle shed could at the very least have gates.

This set and the Medieval Village are similar in that they're based on simple, unexciting rural scenes. But whereas Medieval Village compensated for its lack of excitement (no huge armies or catapults or dragons there) with a fantastic design and attention to detail, this set fails to be either exciting or detailed. There are no fires to put out or villains to pursue, but there is also no creative genius at work here either.

I'm hoping that this range will evolve and grow over time - if you look at the original Harry Potter sets for example, they look extremely dated. Maybe four years from now, if Lego continue this line or revisit it, we will see farm buildings to get properly excited about.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"AlterBrick__Vienna__Austria","2009-07-05T20:08:56.903Z","Good Stuff","
The cute pied cows and the blue tractor are the best. 
The cows are simply unique.
The tractor: Just count the number of headlights ;-) The double backwheels make it look as strong as like a bodybuilder.

The farmer-minifig is cool too as well as the full collection of ""pets"": dog, cat & mouse.

The hayrick with trap-doors inside and the crane on top and the ladder offer a lot of ""hay-handling-opportunities"".

The trailer can be loaded by the dark-red silo and unloaded in 3 ways (also easy: to refill the silage back into the top of the silo ;-)

The little mowing-tractor is fun as well as the repair-tools (becoming a standard in all city sets?). But I would not really miss one of them, if they were not included.

Nice gimmicks: The 2 birdhouses, that give a rural touch. (The headlight-brick should be renamed to ""birdhouse-brick"" ;-)

Interessting parts besides the ones already mentioned: 
+6 1x16 tan bars, which can be very useful to build something big. 
+3 red, huge 8x16 tiles, to build easy-to-open roofs. 
+4 fences, to build something else that's fancy - here they would have needes only 1.
+4 huge wheels and a power-shovel enable you to build a front-end loader instead of the big tractor
+For starters there is nice special stuff like a barrel, a crate, a drinking trough, a 2-wheel-hand truck etc . . . that is always nice to furnish own models

Finally stickers: I did not put on 1 single of them. I do not miss them at all - it all looks nice without them and gives me the possiblity to rebuild the silo eg. as a water tower for my emerald night.

If there were not sets like green grocer or the mentioned emerald night, I would give it a 5 - for AFOLs it is a 4 because it is rather simple in comparison - for kids, who do not want to assemble 2.000 parts and who are in favor of bright colors, it's a 5!

It does not have to be an emergency to be fun, right? In fact, emergencies mostly are not fun at all - so please increase the variety of city sets (eg a factory, library, bakery, ...) - Lego City hasn't ever been more interesting!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"aplbomr79","2009-12-30T04:40:10Z","Because it is a farm with a Ford Tractor...","I know that I will get dinged for the Ford comment... but it is an awesome set.  The tractor actually more represents a New Holland, but I am a Ford Man.  It is a nearly complete set as it does not include a Farmhouse, but I am sure that comes later...

I will begin with the negatives...

-The Barn is a bit small; with no walls.  
That is it.

Positives:
+Tractor and Trailer... these are the kingpins of the set.  Without these, the set would not sell at all.  Great detail in both... I love how it includes a front-end loader for the Ford (New Holland) Tractor.
+OAW Welding Station... what farm is without one?  Maybe include a MIG or TIG welder next time - it would be more realistic to modern day.
+Utility Cart... alright, most Farms don't have a utility cart, but a utility shed would add another $20 to the set.
+The Cub Cadet Lawn Tractor (even though they are now a beige color) - nice touch.  It would be better as a JD as they have more implements... but what the heck.
+Various Animals: Two cows, a mutt, a cat, and a mouse are a nice touch... but really?  Only two Holsteins with horns?  Knock the horns off and add a couple more cows and now it is a Dairy Farm.

With the addition of the Combine, the Pig Farm, the Tractor, and the Farmer sets, the mini-figs will more than compensate for the lack of them in this one.  I cannot wait to see the rest.

I have already purchased 4 Tractors for my nephews and I await the Pig Farmer set for my Uncle's boys (as he is a Pig Farmer).

Great Job LEGO!  Keep it up and I will continue to purchase from this line!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"av8r1973","2011-02-13T08:38:38.483Z","Wonderful addition to my collection - unique set","This was the last set in the farm subtheme for us and we were able to find it online here in Taiwan significantly less than US retail. &nbsp;It's now the centerpiece in our railway scene.<div><br></div><div>On it's own, this set may not stand well for playability. &nbsp;There are a lot of features, but it would really look out of place without some additional components available in the other sets. &nbsp;Here's a list of what you get.</div><div><br></div><div>1. The tractor is very nice. &nbsp;With the dual wheels in the rear and the nice loader bucket up front, this was nice. &nbsp;I was happy to see the bright blue Ford/New Holland colors since the other theme tractors are red and lime-green. &nbsp;Two minor drawbacks. &nbsp;The first, if you lower the bucket arms all the way, they rub on the front tires. &nbsp;Second, the mast on which the mirrors and lights mount to are only secured at the bottom. &nbsp;This makes it pretty easy to fall off. &nbsp;The trailer is a nice dumper design with flip-down sides. &nbsp;It's smooth.</div><div><br></div><div>2. The riding lawn mower will soon find many replicas throughout my city. &nbsp;Nicely done! &nbsp;It even has a nice bagger attachment, so it will do well in my Creator suburb of my city layout. &nbsp;Very cool. &nbsp;My daughter put the female minifig on it and said she could mow the grass.</div><div><br></div><div>3. Lots of animals were provided. &nbsp;Two cows, a dog, a mouse and a cat. &nbsp;The other sets complete the animals with pigs and horses, but there aren't any chickens or ducks. &nbsp;Not a big problem, but I would like to have some.</div><div><br></div><div>4. The barn is nice. &nbsp;I started to complain about the open sides, but it sure makes it easy to retrieve hay bales that didn't hit their mark going into the trailer. &nbsp;I am ok with it now. &nbsp;Both sides of the roof lift up to use the hayloft. &nbsp;The floor has a nice opening to drop the bales down into a trailer. &nbsp;There is a nice hoist to get the hay upstairs, too. &nbsp;Except for the open walls, this is exactly like the barn on our farm in Alaska growing up. &nbsp;Lots of good memories when building this.</div><div><br></div><div>5. The grain silo is a great touch. &nbsp;Pretty realistic and it even comes with some ""grain"". &nbsp;Of course, I need to buy another couple hundred to fill the silo and trailer, but... &nbsp;I was a bit nervous that it would be flimsy, but it's actually pretty sturdy. &nbsp;The chute opens with a nice little slider to allow filling the trailer.</div><div><br></div><div>6. The stable is nice, but it's better suited for horses. &nbsp;It's still a great little stable and will hold our three horses while the cows are out to pasture. &nbsp;We also placed the cat and mouse in there.</div><div><br></div><div>I wish there was a complete set of the farm subtheme marketed together so it would have been easier to collect it all. &nbsp;Once done, it all really goes nicely together (this farm, the harvester, the SUV and horse trailer, tractor, pig farm, and the farmer set). &nbsp;A few more green baseplates to make the fields, and I will be good to go.</div><div><br></div><div>If you are looking to add to your rural theme, this is a must-have set. &nbsp;If it's your first, then plan to get the rest of the theme. &nbsp;I am happy with it, and the price is reasonable for the creativity and content.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"Mickitat","2012-04-03T05:34:29Z","A terribly flawed set","<p>This set is the main set of the farm subset and at the same time the worst of them all. It has so many flaws, it is really quite astonishing.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The cows are great<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The tractor and trailer:<br>- the tractor is burdend with far too much details. The twin wheels just add to its bulkyness, the mirrors fall off easily and are in the way during play. The hook on the back is useless. It has far too many headlights and is in no way as elegant as the red tractor from 7634<br>- the trailer looks okayish, but is not as sturdy as it should be, the top-part breaking of often. When tipped, it has to be supported by hand if not connected to the tractor. The design of the flap on the back is flawed, the opening is not big enough for larger parts and smaller ones cannot get past the frame.</li><li><br></li><li>The silo and stable:<br>- the stable's roof is not stable, it is connected only at the back and falls off easily. The front feels cramped, especially with the fencing in place.<br>- the silo is simply terrible. The stilt parts, which have been used in other sets before, are useless, they have no possibilities to support them, you cannot even build (without quite some effort) a descent breaket system to make them more sturdy. One little shove and the whole thing collapses. While the chute works well enough (some of the grain parts will get stuck unless you modify the intererior a bit), the main question - one which kids will ask, too, is this - how does the grain get in there in the first place?</li><li><br></li><li>The barn:<br>The main problem with the barn is the usage of many large parts. It almost feels like a build from the dreaded 200x era, when many sets were over-simplified. Overall it is okay, but just not good.</li><li><br></li><li>Figs and add-ons:<br>The little mowing tractor and the tools cart, etc. feel like after-thoughts, added to boost piece count. They are just not closely related to the theme and add little in terms of playability and attractiveness of the set. With the same amount of parts surely more suitable ideas could have been realised.<br><br></li></ul>All in all this is a terribly flawed set, one of the worst I have seen in quite some time. While the idea of having a farm set is great, the execution failed badly - unfortunately many of the faults are not obvious until the set has been build and played with.",TRUE,2,2,2,2,2
"Lego225","2017-05-06T22:23:07.34Z","Best set ever","<p><br />
Let me start by saying this is one of my favorite sets I&nbsp;have ever gotten and I have a lot of other great city sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build for the barn and silo are very nice and simple then when you build the tractor and wagon the build becomes complex for a city themed set which is for younger kids but TFOLs and AFOLs&nbsp;also have a great time with the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts are fairly common parts mostly&nbsp;the torso for the female farm worker and the farmers hat as well as the cat are not very common pieces&nbsp;so it is great to have them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The price of this set has gone up quite a lot going from $90 in 2009 to now costing $420 U.S. brand new.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I absolutely love this set. This is one of the best sets i have ever gotten. Really wish Lego would re release&nbsp;a farm theme.</p>
