This one is a good example, because of the robot and the battering ram.  You won't find anything like these small sets in the SP2 or Black Knights themes.  The gun cart does have two pirates but doesn't seem all that special otherwise.  The airplane is negligible and the windsurfer unnoticeable.  The sets that aren't Town make it worth buying.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

If you need an army builder for Pirates and Dragon Knights, this is the set to get. A 5 out of 5 for a great job mixing the right themes.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
