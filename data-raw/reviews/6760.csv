"jschwarz","2009-02-10T09:31:05.31Z","Huge - but a big price tag for limited play value","This combine harvester is one huge vehicle - probably one of the biggest vehicles ever seen in the LEGO City theme.  The body of the harvester is some 12 studs wide!  And the rotating blade in front is a good deal wider than that.  

However, for its huge size, there isn't much else to the harvester.  The blade rotates when the harvester is pushed along the ground, and hay bales can be stored inside the body of the harvester.  The cab opens as well.  I was hoping for some Technic-style automation features, but none of this is present. 

In terms of parts, there are a few new ones - such as the large inverted 3x4x5 slope pieces.  In the past, we've seen these used for windscreens, but only now are these starting to appear in opaque colors - green in this set, and red in the Farm set.  The hexagonal pieces that comprise the rotating blade are a new element, and this set is a good source of flex tubing and large wheels.  The other elements are fairly conventional.

With its large and extra-large wheels, it seems like a credible alternate model of a farm tractor could be built.  No alternates are included with this model, of course, since LEGO does not do that anymore.

The bottom line with this set is that you pay a lot for fairly limited play value especially for the price; the Farm and 4WD w/ Horse Trailer sets both offer better.  But, if you like gigantic farm machinery.... you can't do much better than this.

"lotographia","2009-04-14T01:25:11.653Z","At least it's not just some Mobile Police Command Center.","Originally this set was far, far off my shopping list. I like pirates and cowboys and space sets and adventurers of all sorts... not farm equipment. Who wants to build farm equipment?

However, this set, along with the other farm sets, did set a train of thought in motion. For a long time I've been reluctant to start collecting city sets - there are far too many emergency vehicles and far too few civilians. Imagine trying to build a city and having every second vehicle a police car or truck or van or motorcycle or an ambulance or fire truck.

The farm theme set the ball rolling in a different direction for me. Instead of trying to build a lego 'city', I would build a small rural farming village. I'd pick my sets according to whether they belong in a small village - for example, the police stations are too big, as are the police vans, but Police Car 7236 is just right to patrol the streets of this small town. As are Doctor's Car 7902 and Fire Car 7942. The civilian buildings I collect like the service station and the future 'city corner' aren't overwhelmed by enormous police and fire stations.

This isn't so much a review of the set as an idea for where it could fit into a collection. I think I prefer the Lego company taking risks like this set than to just revising the range of police and fire cars every year. I only mark this set down because there's no mechanism to rotate the drum when you push the vehicle forward.

"Monty","2009-11-05T12:26:15.233Z","CLAAS Act - updated.","<p>Not bought much Lego for ages as there was nothing in the 2009 sets that really inspired me, and the few I have bought have not been made up yet. When this first appeared in the catalogue I thought it looked good, but I also thought it was a bit pricey for what it was so I didn’t get it. When the Xmas catalogue arrived last week my wife said have you seen this combine harvester – it looks really good – so with that seal of approval I went and got one. She was actually with me when I got it and I also persuaded her to get me the S.W. Venator for Christmas – result!</p>
<p>I made this straight away and it looks pretty good to me. Combines are a fairly distinctive vehicle anyway, but this does look very accurate compared to photos of various machines I have studied. I love watching them in operation for real – they can usually be spotted by the huge cloud of dust that accompanies them, or you drive round a bend in a country lane and have to brake sharply as one is coming at you taking up the whole road like some sort of lumbering monster on its way to the next field, often with the cutter removed and being towed on its carrier by a tractor. The modular build technique of this set does allow you to remove the whole cutter assembly just like on the real thing.</p>
<p>The colour scheme of green and white appeals to me, as it is seen on the Claas&nbsp;machines, but I would have liked it better if they had used the more accurate lime green colour and the rotary collector/cutter could have been in red to complete the authentic appearance of a Claas&nbsp;machine. I think the cab detail is good as is the cutter and the detail on the top of the machine with the exposed drying gear fan and engine is good. As had been said the cutter rotates as you push it along, and so far mine has not fallen apart as suggested by others – it needs to be tight on tolerances as otherwise it would foul the support arm as it rotates. Rear steering wheels might be an easy addition, and I am working on adding external mirrors and an accurate ladder arrangement so it actually reaches down to nearer the ground, and I am tweaking colours to a better combo rather than say a green 2x1 plate where a white one should be used.</p>
<p>There are some stickers, but in view of the fact that I now know through bitter experience (see my earlier reviews) these will go brittle, disintegrate, and peel off in about 2 years time so it means I am no longer applying Lego stickers to my new&nbsp;models unless absolutely necessary or i make my own which last much longer.</p>
<p>The big disappointment for me was the bales falling out of the middle of the underside of the vehicle. I had expected some sort of mechanism or similar worked by pushing it along that would have worked them through to the back, but you just lift the top of the grain bin off and drop them in so they can fall straight through or just as easily stick and never come through. They really should be falling out nearer the back (but not as bales) and assisted by some sort of mechanism (straw walker on the real thing) driven from the wheels would have been better – especially for the price.<br/>Although the finished vehicle is quite large and does contain the new hexagon plate elements to make the collector/cutter, I feel the set is overpriced – especially with the bale drop through. But it continues to impress me as a static model and has potential for tweaks so I will give it a 4.</p>
<p><strong>Addtional Comments added 12.10.10</strong></p>
<p>I don’t normally come back on others’ reviews on the basis that I am able to say what I want and others should be able&nbsp;to have their say. However, on re-reading some of these reviews nearly a year later, I feel I ought to defend a couple of points for which the set has been criticised – especially as I have been out watching, photographing and even riding in the real thing in the recent harvest.</p>
<p>As I said the reason it is green and white has much to do with the fact that in Europe, the combine market is dominated by the German manufacturer Claas, and Lego are a European based company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until very recently Claas even used to make a model called “Dominator”. I would say 8 out of 10 combines I have seen in the UK are Claas, so most UK residents if asked would say they are green and white. The most powerful combines in the world are the Claas Lexion models sold in the U.S. as CATs in their yellow paint scheme – not red. Yes they are necessarily very big and so is the set which is what I was expecting, this year Claas launched a 12m wide cutter which has a split reel.</p>
<p>I bought another model to provided additional hexagonal elements for my cutter reel and putting it together flat on a firm surface is the key.&nbsp;Put on the first long tube element then turn it 180 degrees and add the one opposite next. Doing the same with the next 2 pairs works wonders for its rigidity and it runs much better without any wobbles – might I suggest if you have problems take it apart and rebuild it that way – even with only the 4 hexagonal elements provided in the set it should work. The reel is oversize, but that is how Lego got it to work – I have modified mine to a belt drive which raises it up as per the prototype. This explains why the dividers at the ends of the cutter seem too short in comparison. It should also be remembered that depending on what crop is being harvested, the table can be extended and various knives etc can also be added as required. A laser pilot could also have been added as i have done to mine.</p>
<p>As regards the one Minifig you only normally get a driver – maybe an occasional passenger as I have been, but it explains why you only have one Minifig. And why would you want another vehicle in the set – it is what it says – a combine - you can buy a tractor set if you want one as well – and yes that is red.</p>
<p>If you are interested, my much tweaked 7636 is available for viewing on my Brickshelf page, since which I have added MOC “Terra Tracs” which are available as an option on some Claas Lexions.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Judsonr","2009-07-16T20:01:22.483Z","If it were real, it would always be in the barn needing to be fixed.","  Great idea, bad execution, because the front section of the roller is too close to the tollerences, and the thin black parts are always popping off one end or the other.  I actually took it apart three different times trying to see if I had done something wrong (I hadn't).  Good to look at, not so much fun to play with.  Have it displayed with a couple of modified Heavy Loaders 7900 to make it appear that it is being transported.
  I was also missing a piece: a first for building LEGO sets for over 30 years.  LEGO customer service got the replacement piece to me in less than a week.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Night_City_Dream","2009-10-15T03:50:21.89Z","Probably the worst set","LEGO made big news by announcing it would launch the Farm subseries. It was very interesting to get this hand-on experience (I purchased all the 4 sets). But this one made a dent.

There's very few points about this set that may be positive. I'll point to the minifig, it's nicely painted. The design of the cabin is interesting. And the drum, too. Added to this, I think, the whole look is fine, too: the harvester looks quite realistic.

Now, negative sides.
1. Size. It's awfully big. Why does it have wheels that are sometimes bigger that a whole car? Te drum is a bit shorter than the Fire Station! The same for it's height. It's almost 12 studs wide which makes it too big in comparison with almost all LEGO City / Town vehicles.

2. It only comes with one minifig. Which is nice but still only one for a big and costly set.

3. Only one vehicle. I don't like this conception when the set is rather big but there's only one vehicle.

4. The pieces are mainly bricks, big and simple.

5. The functionality is zero. It can only move. It can't harvest, can't flow the grain into the trailer or smth like that.

Given all this above, I can't say the set is a success. By the way, in many stores where Lego is sold, there are lots of 7636 and they stay out there.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"prisim","2009-08-31T13:12:25.7Z","A really fun set!","I was so excited to see the farm sets come out. My Lego city was full of civil servants and needed some variety. The combine has a grain shoot for bales of grain to pop out of, and rotating blades. The huge tires were a treat, and are a great addition to my tire collection. The farmer even has coffee, just like in real life. The set could have been improved by lengthening the black rods used as ""blades"" by 0.5cm. They are just a little too short.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"aplbomr79","2009-12-30T04:25:10.81Z","The first of its kind...  but not RED","Being the first stab at Farm Machinery outside of Tractors, Lego nearly hit a home run.  It is their attempt and close ideals that I give it a '5'... but they painted it green.  So they receive a '4'.  

First off, combines are HUGE machines in America... I don't know about other countries, but this is one big beast.  They are a one man operation in most aspects; and they operate day and night when the weather permits.

It is nearly realistic in its appearance.  Yes, the tires are larger than most cars.  That is how they are here in the States.

The separation spears do not stick out far enough, I will grant you that.  And the blades are not as rugged as I would hoped that they would be.  However, I do not fault Lego for those aspects... again, it is their first attempt.

HOWEVER, I DO fault them for not producing this in International Red.  If you ask a person in the States what color a Combine is, 99% would say 'RED'... and the farm folk in my area would say 'International Red'. 

Kudos, Lego, keep up the good work and keep pushing out the Farm Theme... it will catch on eventually.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"av8r1973","2011-02-12T09:12:10.79Z","A true masterpiece - Please make more unique sets like this one, LEGO!!","I spent a lot of time on farms growing up and still love farm machinery. I think LEGO did a bang up job and created a masterpiece with this one. &nbsp;I now have the entire farm subtheme and this is my favorite. &nbsp;I hesitated because the blade structure looked pretty flimsy and I have small kids near the sets all the time. &nbsp;I broke down and bought it when it showed up online here in Taiwan. &nbsp;I am NOT disappointed and only wish I had bought it much earlier.<div><br></div><div>The scale of this machine is great. &nbsp;LEGO really did their homework on studying photos of real machinery. &nbsp;I think the photos must have been black and white, because (as another reviewer mentioned) most harvesters in America's heartland are International Red. &nbsp;Most other farm gear is John Deere green, but not harvesters. &nbsp;That's such a minor downer, since most components can be purchased from Bricklink in red.</div><div><br></div><div>The realism is also great. &nbsp;From the pilot's cabin, to the hopper, to the chute, to the engine breathers...this one has it all. &nbsp;It's truly a masterpiece. &nbsp;The playability is also great! &nbsp;The floating blades allow it to cruise over an uneven floor. &nbsp;The fully opening cabin should be migrated into other kits - it's just smooth! &nbsp;The addition of a few hay bales is nice, too. &nbsp;The minifig and his coffee mug look good in their Sunday best. &nbsp;What? &nbsp;I've never seen a farmer dress up like that unless he's asking the bank man for a loan.</div><div><br></div><div>With the Farm tractor along side to catch the grain, it makes for a highly playable set. &nbsp;Perhaps more so than any other City set. &nbsp;Bravo to LEGO for this one - I truly hope to see other unique sets like this in the near future. &nbsp;Don't hesitate - buy it.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
