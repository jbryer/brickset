If you pulll it back all the way, it will tilt backwards and continue to ride on it's spoiler which amazingly still keeps it in a pretty straight line! The stickers look great (although I did not apply them,as I needed the peaces clean for other builds) and you also get a few cool parts such as the grill,exhaust intake, back wheels and of course the pull back motor.</p>
<p>The only dissapointing aspect for me was the fact that it has just a few pieces (quite a few less than even the other power racers).</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3
