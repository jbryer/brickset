On to the review

Pros

- The rubber wheels are great. If you hit a wall the set won't fall apart
- Pull back motor is good. On wooded floors can clear more than 15 feet. Works well on carpets too
- Stickers are ok, only 5 so not a big deal

Cons

- The ramp is useless. The fact that the box gives you the idea that you can jump quite a distance is actually not true. The cardboard is quite flimsy and its quite hard to aligned the car to hit the ramp. 
- The spoiler has the tendency to break on occasions. Need to do some adjustments on that

Overall great design. Great car. Just skip the ramp and use the motor function only.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
