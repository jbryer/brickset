Pro

-An extra sword in the kit!
-a great cannon (I'd buy more sets just for this cart type cannon)

Con
- the wall designed to breakway is a bit flimsy (falls apart way to easy)  maybe should have had a cross beam at the top where just the middle blew out.
- As mentioned sets about $1.00 too high - still I'd pay it again for the great additions this set brings to any pirate collection.

"Shadow_Crawler","2009-05-02T23:46:28.873Z","Somewhat Disappointing","Well, as the title suggests, this is pretty disappointing.
Box : 5/5
This is the only thing in this set that I considered perfectly created. It really attract customers-to-be to buy this little money-sucker.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions : 2/5
There are several mistakes in the instructions. The minifig head for the pirate and the soldier is wrong. they put the pirate's head on the soldier and vice versa. Another mistake is on Step 6. The yellowish golden monocular should be placed with the bigger side downward, not upward. But this instructions have a jagged feature on the upper right side, to resemble a cliff, maybe.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building : 4/5
Not very interesting, kinda boring when building this one. The most interesting part is the base of the wall.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Playability : 4/5
Well, I must give a four for the playability because even though it's gotta be the only reason we buy this set, the cannon doesn't shoot far sometimes. It requires precise pull to let it fly far enough and strong enough. More cons, if you direct the cannon downward, the ammo will fall, thanks to gravity and Newton. I wonder how the cannon on Brickbeard's Bounty will shoot the soldier's boat. Even more cons, The wall isn't connected by stud-tube. It is just placed there without any connection at all. I know this is supposed to make the wall easily break apart when shot, but it would be better if there's at least one stud and one tube connecting, so it won't fall apart when you  brought it to a friend's house, for example.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detail : 4/5
The detail's pretty good for this set. There's a map and plants on the wall. You also have two ammo for the cannon.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compare With Money : 2/5
In the US, this set is priced for $ 5.99, which is a pretty good price. However in Indonesia, this set is priced for Rp. 134.900.00, which is equal to $ 11.74 or roughly twice the US price, so I don't think this is worth enough if you're outside US.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall : 3.5/5
Basically, there's only two reasons you would want to buy this : You want to build a cannon soldier army, and you just want to complete your pirate collection. It wasn't good for army building, sonce Soldier's Arsenal is much more cheaper and you get equipments. If you want to have at least one cheap Pirates in your collection, I suggest you get Krakken' Attacking.

The set features to minifigs: a pirate with a sword and map and a British soldier with a musket and sword. The cannon fires with an interesting new design. Just load the cannon with one of the ammunition pieces, pull back the handle thing on the back and it fires away with great precision! Also, the wall breaks and fixes easy. And, the set features a cool cannon lighter with cool realistic fire piece on top. Well, to sum things up, this set is great!

"lotographia","2009-02-08T00:19:01.89Z","Land superiority.","Without having a ship of their own yet, the navy use their resources to gain superiority on the land instead. Bad luck to any pirate ship that encounters an army of these cannons when attempting to pillage a town.

The two minifigs in this set are great, as are all pirate minifigs so far, but unfortunately if you own any other pirate set you'll almost certainly already have one or the other of these chaps already.

There isn't much rebuild potential for this set - the only thing I can think of is to rebuild the wall into a small fortification for the cannon. It should be extremely easy to attach the cannon to a horse though I haven't tried this yet.

If I had done this set myself I would have replaced the wall with a horse and the pirate with another soldier. Realistically the cannon needs to be transported somehow and would require at least two people to work in battle. Also I would have given it a black antenna for a ramrod. Then it would be perfect.

The cannon and soldier would make great 'army builders' if that didn't also mean you'd end up with lots of identically walls. Since this is a play set aged at 5-12, though, it makes sense that they'd focus on the play potential of soldier vs pirate rather than the collectible potential of cannon, horse and two soldiers.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Here's what you get:

- a cannon
- a long gun, treasure map, sword, golden scope, flame, and new and nice marine hat.

pros:

- pirate and marine.
- cannon with very nice and special color
- treasure map, gun and sword.

cons:

<p>1) Low cost: I paid SGD$10 for this set&nbsp;at some&nbsp;sales and it's really cheap in my&nbsp;opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Great army builder: The additional pirate is a good addition to the small crew onboard of 6243 (Brickbeard's Bounty) and the soldier is a good addtion to the relatively insufficient crew members onboard of 10210 (Imperial Flagship).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Good torso prints: The prints on both the minifigure is really great and it is really nice to collect more of such good minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Weapons: This set comes with a long rifle for the pirate which he can bring with it onboard of 6243 (Brickbeard's Bounty). There are two swords which the soldier and the pirate can take one each and have a sword fight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Cannon: Most important of this feature of the set is the additional cannon which is a perfect addtion to my Imperial Flagship which has only cannons when the ship has eight openings for cannons. </p>

<p>Cons: I do not know what to do with the grey bricks of this set except for some MOC purposes.</p>

1. Two figures, both opposing and battling each other
2. Arg! ye map be in de set
3. A wall to protect the pirate...or blow him off the island...
4. good price

Cons:
1. The wall isnt secure at all! So a little modification would work out of spare pieces, and you're all set. Then you can still blast it, but keep it from falling off when moving it.
2. The cannon ball won't shoot if you don't pull the trigger back right (But this is in all LEGO Pirates sets with cannons)

I recommend this set to any new Pirates fan, especially due to its modular build. Also good for a birthday gift/stocking stuffer.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I do wish the thing you blasted was easier to keep together. Also, I opened the box and found one of the pieces missing in my second copy of the set.

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-28T12:08:08.54Z","I Know Those Guns","<p>Set #6239 Cannon Battle: Arrrrr, mateys, Lego be returnin' to Pirates says I. And that's just great in my book. This was my first set from the new Pirates Theme and I have to say it's not that bad, but for the price they could have included maybe a third Mini-Figure or even better the Monkey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like it despite the flaws, but there are a few noticeable problems with this set from a collectors standpoint. And most of those flaws can be summed up in one sentence... How does hiding behind a blast-apart wall that small protect you from a cannon that big!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Mini-Figures in the Pirate theme are a nice update from the classic theme. I used to have quite a number of them and all around I can safely say these new ones are impressive looking. I especially like the new double-sided printing LEGO has implemented in recent years for the torsos. Now you get to see what their outfits look like from the back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pieces included with this set accessorywise are also new to me and really neat. (Well as far as the cannon and the telescope go, I've seen those cutlasses and blunderbusts before.) It's a nice cheap set, but I think LEGO could have done better with the blast-apart wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building wise there isn't much here, one cannon on wheels and one tiny little wall that can be blown apart by the Real Firing Cannonballs! (I am so impressed by this addition alone, my old Pirate sets never included actual firing cannons, so getting one of them for me was like christmas coming early or something.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this set is worth it if you can get it on sale, but paying full price for it might be a little dissapointing. Still it is a nice little set for troop building, and if you bought enough of them maybe you could actually build a proper protective barricade for the gaggle of Pirates now being attacked by the swarm of cannons.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,3

<p>&nbsp;Fairly cheap for two&nbsp;figures and a cannon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons: The figures are&nbsp;the same&nbsp;to&nbsp;many others in&nbsp;different pirate sets.&nbsp;</p>

"vith","2011-04-29T05:40:58.273Z","Small, yet charming.","A small set which you'll probably buy for the cannon and the two minifigs. The wall isn't much of a build.

"Ernst","2012-04-02T15:20:18.18Z","Cannon battle, good set and great parts !","<p>Overall 5 bricks : A small set with good parts, great playability and an affordable price.&nbsp;A&nbsp;must have for a Pirates collector&nbsp;and&nbsp;a nice addition for others to play with or for parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : the building is not spectacular which is normal for a small set. The only thing you built is the pirates defence wall so not that hard. The cannon you assemble so not more than 3 bricks here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts&nbsp;5 bricks : 2 nice minifigures, a cannon, weapons, a torch, green leafes, treasurecard&nbsp;and all usefull bricks. Very good for a set this size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks : in advance you know who wins the battle but still the set itself has great playability and combined with other Pirates sets even more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : a great set for a small price, new already for € 4,99 in Holland and used even less. A single&nbsp;used rare minifigure costs the same, 5 bricks well at place.</p>

"Mr__Thrawn","2018-11-30T16:33:48.12Z","Simple, But it Works","<p>This was a nice set that I had when I was younger. It has since been disassembled. I think. It was like 10 years ago.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box and Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is miniscule. I mean it. It&#39;s probably around 3.5&quot; square, and 2&quot; deep. When you have successfully mutilated it by tearing open the pushtab, you get to dump out all forty-five parts in a single tiny bag. Oh joy.&nbsp; Then come the instructions. It&#39;s been said that these instructions are possibly the most frustrating items known to man. Many have been driven mad by the glacial pace of the instructions shown in the miniscule images. And then comes the comic strip, to add insult to injury. In all honesty, this isn&#39;t the kind of set you buy for the box.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Ehm. It doesn&#39;t really exist. Sticking a cannon into a little cradle and sticking some grey&nbsp;bits together loosely with a mystical gold thingy on top isn&#39;t what I&#39;d really call an earth-shattering experience.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Completed</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s a wall and a cannon. That&#39;s pretty much it. The wall is essentially an exercise in frugality and redundancy. It&#39;s too short for our jolly pirate to hide behind, and too small to produce a satisfying collapse when it&#39;s fired upon. Also, what the heck is that little gold thing? A magical talisman? A small ornament? Some short of shield projector to save Mr. Jolly Pirate (I think I&#39;ll call him Jimmy)?The cannon is also ridiculously small. A tiny grey-ish tube resting upon a red-ish&nbsp;box. Huzzah. It can be fired, though, and this was one of the first sets to include said feature since the early 90s. Again, though, it really doesn&#39;t have any effect on the wall.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Jimmy the pirate is nice, with a striped shirt, green bandana, and JANG face.</p>

<p>The soldier is much better. He does, however look extremely perturbed about something. Very. So upset as to border on sadistic.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is a small set with almost no resale value. It&#39;s great for kids, and Pirates completionists will want it. Other than that, the set is a bit... meh. Not bad, but not good either.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary- Mediocre. Not bad, but meh.</p>
