pro- 
1. double printed torso (finally lego!)
2. the raft, it is so realistic, except it could have been all brown
3. the parrot
4. the telescope
con-
1. the kracken (it is really an octopus, they could have put about 10 more parts in to make a realistic kracken tentacle (like in Pirates of the Caribbean)
2. none others i can think of.

overall i rate this set 4/5 or 9/10.   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Tri_pod_king","2008-11-26T20:10:36.45Z","Nice move, Lego","Finally, a promising Lego theme! I mean Power Miners and Agents look pretty cool, but it's not always about the big new flashy pieces, it's about the sets themselves. And what's more, Lego had the spunk to bring back a classic theme, throw in a few new pieces, and make it cool, at the very same time!
                              This is a small set. In this theme, size can be deceiving. Size doesn't matter. This set is fun to play with, well-constructed, and has a few new pieces. What others have been saying about the double-sided torsos are true! They look great! The 'Kraken' is awesome! The raft is sturdy! I couldn't ask for anything else! (Well, except the following: a monkey, a pistol, another sword, and possibly a shark, rather than a kraken. ; )   ) If you have 10 bucks and are looking for something worth your money, GET THIS SET. I mean it, it's a great set.

I put it together in roughly 10 minutes and while the build was short, I would say this one of the better small Lego sets I've acquired in my time. 
  The raft is too small for a lot of action, but it's OK because you can put this in with a bigger set. I like how the use of cylindrical 2x2 bricks gives it a slapped-together-from-logs-and timber-from-the-shipwreck-and held-together-with-chewing-gum feel.

Pro:
2 pirates when I could easily see a set like this getting just one

There's also a jewel for each pirate so they can divide their treasure equally.

I'm just not sure about the 'kraken' though - it looks more like an octopus to me. Maybe it's supposed to be only the head above the surface? In any case it could have had a LOT more thought and effort put into it.

The parrot looks cheaper than the original parrot, but all the other pirate updates please me. I love the new torso designs and look forward to adding more to my collection.

"Nased","2010-09-17T00:16:45.37Z","One of the best Raft ever!","<p>I was hesitant to buy this set in the year 2009 because it has lesser minifigures than 6257 (Castaway's Raft) and it is smaller in size. I manage to get hold of this set in the year 2010 and I am very happy and pleased with this set. Hence, I think it is time for me to give this set a nice review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set has many features, pros and something that can be improved upon. I will make a list below based on the various aspects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Cost: I paid SGD$17 for it at a sales and I am happy with the price though I hope it could be even cheaper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Minifigures: The prints are awesome and these two pirates are not 100% repetitive. Most of the pirates in this series are unique or have different combination of headdress and clothings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Weapons: 1 rifle and 2 swords. I think this is self-sufficient as a set on its own and I don't have to pay for more weapons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Accessories: It has a parrot with tropical colours (Red and Green), a paddle, a crate and most importantly the 2 gems (blue and red, so i suppose they are sapphire and ruby). I love it when the amount of treasure for my pirates increase over time and this set simply adds more treasure on top of the other sets like 6243 (Brickbeard's Bounty).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Kraken (Octopus): I never had this rare or uncommon piece before so I think it's a good buy got me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) Playability: I will leave it up to your imagination but I imagine that the two pirates are the underlings of Captain Brickbeard and they are on this raft to set off on a mission etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion: I think this set is a very nice set. It increases the total number of pirates in this series; increases the treasure of the pirates; increases the weapons of the pirates and you get a kraken. Just get it and I had so much fun playing with it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Leggodt94","2009-05-31T17:50:47.873Z","A Very Crafty Raft","In my opinion there are two types of sets: the kind you get just because it looks big and cool or the kind that you get for all the pointless little extras. I think that this set fits into the extras category, extras like the colorful parrot, the telescope the two crystals and an extra sword. It also comes with two cool pirate minifigs and of course the octopus or ""kraken"" as LEGO refers to it. The raft features a look out tower pole, an adjusting ladder, and little stand thing for the parrot. I think that it was cool that the kraken's tentacles were adjusted at the ends so that it could connect with studded platforms. However, I did not like that the kraken was so small. Well, everything, besides the kraken's size, seems to make this great. It also works well with Loot Island and Cannon Battle lego sets. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"18000pieces","2009-07-22T16:43:46.42Z","A fixer-upper","I bought this set in Downtown disney a few months ago because I had bought a snack with part of the twenty dollars I was going to use to buy loot island, and so only had enough for this. I ended up liking it much more than I though I would.

The 'Kraken' - I agree that this piece is not big enough to be considered a Kraken. But it's still pretty cool. It is an octopus, not a squid, as some others have said, because it only has eight arms. In addition to the four arms that can attach to studded platforms, the octopus can grasp things the same width as things minifig hands can grasp with the four middle arms. (try it, it works!) The maroon color is very nice and realistic, and contrasts well with the raft.

The Raft - I liked it. The SNOT design really enhances the looks, and it feels like something made of chopped-down palm trees with a sail-canvas floor. I moved the crow's nest off center and really played around with the floor layout depending on what I wanted for the scenario I was acting out. Most of the time that would have put it off balance on the ocean, but it's hard to capsize on my floor. The one thing that makes the pirates seem stupid is their placement of the musket. How do they reach it up there?

The Pirates - They have the awesome double-sided torsos. I ended up mixing and matching hats, shirts, and faces between all three of my pirates (I got another one later), to find a combination that looked like a good pirate, and one that looked like a bad pirate. 

The Accessories - Even thought box only shows one sword, you really get one more, just like in every other set with swords, for which I am eternally grateful to Lego. The gems are just gems, and the parrot is pretty, although useless. The spyglass is good, the musket is good (but out of the pirates' reach), and it's always handy to have another brown bin.

I really like this set - once I fixed it up. If you get one, try playing around with the floor layout and the pirates until you get one you like. It's a five.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two pirate minifigures have different torso prints then anything I've seen in the much older, original Pirate sets to come out. The Crow's Nest Mast on the raft wasn't bad, it makes it different enough from other raft designs.</p>

<p>If this is someone's first introduction to Pirates and picking up any sets, it's pretty good.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is one of those 12.99 sets that offer up fun models for a small cost. I see no problem with that, in fact I see nothing truly wrong with this set overall. You build a raft from a shipwreck for two pirates to reach land on. The raft is a really clever design and something that actually looks like it could have been built out of flotsam and whatever scraps what washed up on shore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are two great additions to the Pirates theme and add more Pirates for you to display and play with. This set includes a familiar parrot piece with a brand new colorful design. In fact when I first saw the new parrot look I was actually quite taken with it, though I can't pinpoint just why that is, perhaps because it's something fresh and new in the world of LEGO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really like the new spyglass piece, there are also the usual cutlasses (one extra so both can wield the blade in battle.) and the Pirate rifle or musket as it is also known. The titular Kraken of this set is just a fancy new reddish toned octopus from the old Aquazone sets, but it is a very nice piece. The new coloring really makes it stand out on the shelf and tends to draw the eye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your money you can't go wrong with Kraken Attackin', it may not have 300 + pieces and depict a creature from myth the size of... well I'm not too sure just how big a Kraken is supposed to be, but it does offer up a lot of potential for play and display and you can't go wrong with Pirates.

"Mr__Thrawn","2018-05-11T14:47:17.89Z","The Most Ridiculous Set Name Ever Gives us a Good Set","<p>The name of this set has always seemed so... weird to me. &quot;Kraken Attackin&#39;&quot;? Huh? As a pirate-obsessed kid, though, it didn&#39;t really matter. The set itself did, and I&#39;m glad to say that it delivers.</p>

<h3>Box and Instructions</h3>

<p>I actually still have the small box and (Somewhat mutilated) instructions for this set. Both are pretty well done, with a tiny Pirates comic strip in the back of the booklet.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures in this set are two generic pirates. I always thought that one looked a bit insane, honestly, but that fits well with a pirate that is being attacked. They both have generic, suitably piratey&nbsp;torsos and hats, and are accessorized with some jewels, a cutlass, a blunderbuss, and a spyglass.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is essentially&nbsp;some reddish brown 2x2 round bricks sandwiched in between tan plates. There is also a parrot, an octopus, and a ladder.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build is&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>repetitive. One simply builds a frame of 2x2 rounds and then sticks a few tan plates and a mast in the middle.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p>Aesthetically, this set is nice. The brown rounds look like logs, and the mast is a nice touch, although there is no sail, just a single steering oar.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This set is&nbsp;<em>fun.</em>&nbsp;The raft has plenty of space for minifigures on it, The octopus provides some play value (namely, for &quot;Attackin&#39;&quot; the raft, and the treasure is fun to bury somewhere in the carpet of your room.</p>
