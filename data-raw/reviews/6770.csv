All things are shown in the official photo,so I don't have to talk too much about the pieces included in this set,so I skip to provide a list about this set:

Pros:
Crocodile,fish
The exclusive old pirate
A nice boat with cannon
A wonderful plate
No sticker

Cons:
Needs more pieces for the price,but when I built up the set,I found it was already big enough,so the price is acceptable.

"Hewkii1992","2008-11-23T23:12:54.733Z","A decent, small set :)","This new pirate set is a great one!  It composes of a main island hide-out, an Imperial boat, and a crocodile.

The island itself is small, but very detailed and composes of a rare baseplate.  I am surprised at the abundance of rare pieces here; a telescope, pirate flag, new fire pieces, a new fish piece, a skull with technic pins on the rear, a dark-green alligator, a gold chest, and an abundance of jewels, one of them pink, the rest yellow and tropical blue.  It is really a decent island, with a small jail/ storage area for the lone Imperial soldier, or the treasure chest.  There is some plant growth on the rear of the monument-like ruin.

The campfire with a cooking fish is a great touch, as with the two pirates armed with cutlasses and a pistol.  The older pirate has a beard and a detailed raggy-like torso, and the younger pirate is scruffy, but well clothed in pirate attire.  The dock is fragile, but designed to look like an actual dock, and the catapult is reminiscent of the Castle 2007 ones.  Despite the simple, but detailed design, the island ruin lacks a firm connection with the baseplate, making it a little shaky.  But when does an island flip over anyway? :D  No worries...

The boat is nothing much, composing of a cannon, two oars, cannonballs, a classic imperial flag and a place for the soldier to sit.  I am going to be biased here, I love the new Imperial soldiers, and their complex detail compared with the earlier versions (same with the pirates included).  The torso and hat are extraordinarily designed, but back to the boat.  The cannons are wonderful, they can fire very far, and the firing mechanism isn't complex, yet promising.  The cannons fire their munitions at a very high speed and distance, and I personally cannot wait to purchase more sets with cannons to have a battle.  However, cannon balls are very hard to find if lost, so try to persuade your skipper to engage pirates in open sea (or carpet, in that matter) :)

"Smallsam99","2008-12-28T18:47:34.327Z","An Lego Island..... Finally!","This set is a medium sized set in the world of pirate lego and once again features new pieces and return of some old. This one features the all new island baseplate which is awesome but awkardly small. Nonetheless this set is great and here's why!

pros: a new blue boat with another cannon for the collection.

A treasure chest with a very rare light blue and pink gem inside.

cool pirate figues, especially the old man
 
another soldier for the army

nice little fort and nice mini features on the island.

alligator and the all-new pirate Island baseplate!

Now to point out cons!

Cons: The island is too small which is already stated but adding another to the back can make a full island which is somewhat decent.

The soldier can't fit in the prison standing up

catapault needs a re-vamp, still okay.

piece count... could be bigger for the price.

Overall a must get pirate set because no collection is complete without one. The price is okay but it still is worth it. I rate it a 9.5/10 and advise you get it.

At first when I got it I was a slight bit disinterested, I suppose it was because I was looking at the box at the time! Anyway, I soon changed my mind after seeing the unique and quite perfect pieces this set had to offer. The minifigs were a joy! With a double sided bodies and rare colored bandanas how could you not turn it down? The game range is quite superb, for the first few days... it was great for making stories and the such up but after a few days I started to neglect it, and instead continue building onto my theme called Space Buccaneers & Planet Bounty Hunters (You can see why I turned my mind to it, unless you're not me of course). 
But rest a sure I managed to build quite a few things out of it, and I think all good builds would be able to, too!
OK, before I finish I suppose I'll go through some Pros and Cons:

Pros:
- Nice new pieces!
- Versatility
- Brand new sand Baseplate.
- Imperial Cannon (They kept it the same as the old Pirates one :) )
- Green croc! One to keep my other one happy.
- Classic Pirate and Imperial flags.
- Imperial Boat
- Rare jewels 
- Loot Island
- Large Rock skull
Cons:
- Baseplate is somewhat smaller then imagined 
- Can't stand the Imperial in the cell properly 
- Both the catapult and cannon easily loose their ammo.
- Bit pricey!

"lotographia","2009-02-13T04:10:44.513Z","Every range has a turkey.","Most of the time I'm aware the lego is slightly overpriced but I don't care. I know I'm paying for quality. However, this one set made me feel somewhat ripped off. I'd estimate that more than a quarter of the money I paid went towards the big ugly island piece. When I opened the set I took the island away from the other pieces and what remained seemed almost pathetic.

And then the island isn't even used properly. Instead of burying the treasure in the cavity at the centre of the island, which would at least have made sense, they bury the treasure behind a cage ABOVE the hollow. It seems like they designed the mould for one thing and then didn't even bother using it for that purpose.

And then, for some reason, the top part of the island isn't even properly attached. And the palm tree... isn't a palm tree. And the cavern for the treasure doesn't have a back wall, it has a flimsy leaf instead. Bravo, lego. This is truly a set designed by a committee.

Okay, redeeming features time. The castaway is a great little minifig. Um... that's about it. Every other interesting thing about this set can be found many times over in other sets.

The island piece is flat on one side so you could buy two island sets and make one big island out of them. I guess that's kind of cool. Hopefully next time Lego use this piece they'll discover more creative potential than used in this set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"goldfish","2009-05-04T10:31:28.81Z","I felt slightly plundered","As a huge fan of Pirate lego from my childhood days, I decided to buy this set and make it with my 3 year old daughter. My first, and major criticism of the set, is that I can only describe the packaging as deceptive in relation to what was inside and the level of building required. This took me literally 10 mins to make, as there is only just over 100 pieces inside. I actually wished I had got a bigger set. For £14.99 I feel this is overpriced for the amount of building and size of the set. I'll do a very quick pros & cons. 

Pros
- Fun map piece
- Cool roasted fish pieces
- 3 nicely designed min-figs
- Unusual skull piece 
- Crocodile

Cons 
- Deceptively large box in relation to contents
- Overpriced by circa £5
- Very quick & basic build
- Flimsy base piece that does not lend itself to other usage 
- Fiddly catapult and cannon

"Cervelet","2009-06-07T09:25:29.873Z","Best baseplate ever. Serious. I have proofs.","First off: the modell has the big-baseplate syndrom, which is the following:
_poor piece/price count
_simple in construction (the plants are a bit flimsy)
_AWESOME baseplate that makes the price go up like mad.
It sums up the construction of the modell.
But there's more to it.

Like all pirate sets no stickers. The flags are printed, the map too.
ou get a sweet piece selection: plants, brown, flames, beautifull shooting cannon (even if it's waaay to big for the ship), blue boat, fish, telescope, swords and so on.

The minifigures are neat. Both-side detaillend print for all three of them! The usual gard (can never have too many of them), the poor shipwrecked beardy guy (with printed legs!), and mister mcPirate, ready to kick some ninja's ass if you have had the chance to buy ninja legos when they cam out.

The baseplate is basically cut in the back. It look a bit werid form behind, but it makes sur for some nice use possiblilities. Just take two times the modell and make your own Island, or add it in an Island MOC between rock formation! It can even be put on a standart baseplate! On the smooth surface some square holes with technic-beam-holes are used with the 2x2 square plate with underlying technic beam to make sure your minifigs have grip points. I bet they can be used on oser fashions. The technich beam hole could hold laser cannons or so. Also, there's a hole in the middle of the plate to pur treasure in or so. This has got to ben the baseplate with the most freakin' uses possible ever conceived.

Playability is fantastic. It's the pirate Island base you need if you can't afford the shipwreck base or want two separate pirate Islands. Combine it with smaller pirate sets and it becomes fantastic. Even so, you get enough to ensure great playability. 

sooo...

design: 4/5. It has flaws (flimsy vegetation, the cannon is too big for the ship) but the lego plate merits a 6/5 so it makes it up.

Figs: 4,5/5. Another head for gard guy would have been great, but hey. Printed hat! Pirinted back! PRINTED EVERYTHING!

Playability: 5/5 it's awesome. In fact it's so great you don't care about the design flaws anymore.

Pieces: 4/5 exellent piece choice, but there could have been a little more. With a true palm tree I would have given it a 5/5.

Price: 4/5. As I said.

Together they were 50 bucks, which was a pretty good deal. On to the pros and cons!

Pros:

- Shipwrecked pirate's beard

- Island baseplate

- There's a secret compartment under the jail cell area

- The Imperial's cannon really fires and rotates!

- Catapult rotates

- Three minifigs 

- Crocodile

- Golden coins

- Minifig accessories, like the swords, two white paddles, gun, map, and the telescope

- The four diamonds, the two yellow ones for the skull's eyes and the pink and blue ones in the chest

- Certain pieces, like the skull, the boat, the two sets of bars and the handle on the cell door, the fish, the holder for the cannon, slanted pieces, the two rotating pieces, and the treasure chest

-Two flags

-The stick the pirate flag is connected to could be used as a cane for your minifigs, such as a Emporer Palpatine's from Star Wars


Cons:

- The catapult has a bad design and dosen't work good

- The imperial soilder can't stand straight up in the jail cell due to his hat

- There's this goldish-brown piece on the left side of the cell that has nothing on it, making that part stand out

- The new fire pieces lood kind of strange

-The palm tree on the right of the island looks kind of strange/dumb

-There's this weird dark green piece on the the left near the from of the Island that I have no idea what it is, so I'm guessing that it is not needed

- The blue piece at the end of the dock stands out, even if you have the island attached to a blue baseplate

-The back of the island baseplate is uh, cut off. If you had two Island baseplates and connected them each on the cut off area it would look cool

The island base plate is very unique to this set and brings a lot of value to this set with it's freshness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 3 minifigures, 2 pirates and a solider. The two pirates are very different and unique to any Pirate Minifigures I've gotten before. With one of them looking very old like he might have spent a long time on the island. The soldiers is fairly standard to what's been done before, his hat sports a printed emblem on it and he's got blue paldrons where yellow and red have often been done before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition there's a blue rowboat with a cannon turrent on it, very similiar to an older Harbor Sentry set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The island must be frequented enough by Pirates as there's a short dock with a catapult on it. There's a small cooking fire with a fish being roasted over it. The rock formation is shaped to look like a skull and then bars that seal away, protect or lock up a gold treasure chest filled with pirate gold coins and gems. Though it can't be very secure if the back of the cave can be broken open by removing the leaf part.</p>

<p>Finishing out this set is an alligator, a refreshing touch then yet another shark. Still there's plenty of smaller elements and accessories that when combined, make this set well worth picking it up.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4

<p>Loot Island is the largest set I have currently from the new Pirates theme, but that may change in the near future if I'm lucky, still as far as LEGO sets go this one isn't all bad, in fact it's pretty downright cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I once owned a few land-based LEGO Pirates sets from back in the day, they were nice and all, but sometimes you wanted to display your sets on an actual island, and this new set offers up that in spades. The new base piece is a welcome change to the usual flat base plates used in constructing things and it stands out on any shelf full of Pirates sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you build to make Loot Island... Well first of all you get to build the Treasure Cave, a hiding spot designed to protect the Treasure from prying eyes. It features a pull away cage and foliage designed to keep the chest safe and unseen from any intruders. You also get to build up Loot Island with a pier and working catapult to defend against the soldier intruder. The small boat also has a bit of building to it to hold the cannon, cannonballs and the seat for the soldier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three Mini-Figures are nice looking too, plus there is a suitably menacing Jolly Roger located on the island making it obvious that this here Loot belongs to the Pirates. I especially like the new Castaway torso and beard, it really makes it look like this guy has been obsessed with the treasure for so long that he's willing to live like a hermit on this Godforsaken speck of land and eck out a meager existence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crocodile. Ah yes the Crocodile, I had a few back in the day thanks to the Islanders sets I once owned, but this new darker toned Croc makes for a neat new way to bring back a piece that some older fans might have held onto. We round up the review by saying that the accessories are the same as most other Pirates sets, but they are still neat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this set is well worth the price, and perhaps LEGO will offer up a future Pirates themed set from the new Disney stuff that includes this base plate with a lot more to build up onto it. (Or even two of them that can be interconnected... Oh now that would be very nice indeed.)</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
