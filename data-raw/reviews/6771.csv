"ssgdave","2008-11-09T15:07:00.717Z","Soldiers' Fort Review","This is a modular build set with 367 pieces in four bags and two instruction books.  Bag 1 is the six minifigs, which include a commanding officer, an NCO, two soldiers, a pirate captain with peg leg hook hand and eyepatch and a pirate, the crocodile (in dark green), monkey, boat and the connecting section that has the palm tree on it.  A negative of this bag is that the tree trunk is already formed in one piece, not like the old Pirate trees you had to construct.  The main base plates for all of the construction are blue 6x8.  Bag 2 is the jail section with a firing cannon mounted on the top on a rotating ring.  Jail has 5 stickers to apply.  The wall pieces are not pre-painted and red brick stickers must be applied.  Back wall of jail removes to allow pirate to escape and provides easier access than the jail door.  Firing cannon has two rounds of ammunition.  Bag 3 is the L-shaped corner section of the fort and has one sticker to apply and the flag.  The flag is clear plastic not fabric like the old ones. Bag 4 is the tower section with the crane and chest.  this was the fun part since the instruction book 2 has been misprinted and skips from step 16 to step 27 and then repeats steps 11 through 16 a second time.  The build however is quite easy and the second floor construction is almost identical to the first, so not to hard to figure out from the completed picture.  Overall, not a bad addition to my old pirate sets and with the dock sections being a standardized build it would not be hard to get addition pieces to create more sections to add to it and it offers opportunity to change the configuration of the sections.  The cost value is probably $10 too high based upon piece count and number of duplicate pieces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The worst thing of this set,is that it's almost empty inside the building,in another word,I can say that all things are shown in the official photo.

Here comes the Pros and Cons:

Pros:
A NEW BOMB(mainly release in Power Miner in 2009)
Monkey,Crocodile,Fish
Nice minifigures
The rarely-release tree
The style of the building
Cool weapons,cannon

The older forts from the early 90's had a more &quot;fortress&quot; quality.  Still its a solid set and the modular construction makes it a great addition to the pirate line.  Shoot I'll be picking up two or three to expand the fort as I see fit.  Let get down to the Pros and Cons list.

Pro:
Great Mini figure count:  4 Imperials/2 Pirates and a monkey!
Modular construction is a great feature
The wench is a nice touch
The jail was perhaps my favorite part to build, the back wall was great.
Love the bridge!

Cons:
Stickers (seriously stickers and LEGO?)
the 2nd floor of the fort hold nothing - a map table would have been spot on
I would have loved to see a weapons rack (as is I'll be adding my own)
I wish the boat had had benches like Shipwreck Hideouts boat (whats 6 more pieces?)


Overall a great set and I'm glad I got it, more then likely I'll pick up another set (good pieces here)
8.5 because the price is a bit high and LEGO seems to have skimped on a few key details (the boat/stickers)  still worth buying though if you down mind the cost (About $10 too high)

I'm not thrilled that these sets are pale cousins of their predecessors...
The Eldorado Fortress ('89) and the Imperial Trading Post ('92) knock the socks of this set.
BUT, this set makes a great addition to any collection.  A fantastic start for the new collector (along with the larger Pirate Ship, 6243).

Not a lot of effort went into this one.

It is natural for us to compare the new ones with the ""old"" ones, but I have tried not to do so. Simply because I know that Lego's designers can't just copy themselves, and therefore we cannot expect sets with the same character and soul.
This Soldiers fort isn't really a fort, we must be that honest. It's more of an outpost, actually. But it's got a new line, that's typical for a lot of todays sets: It's more modul based.
That's OK, but I think it could have been just as nice to place it on a large blue baseplate.
The set includes 6 very nice minifigures, which is very positive. Nice wall bricks, but why with stickers? The old ones were painted with pigment.

Overall, this is a nice set, and I hope we have only seen the beginning of Lego's new generation of pirate sets.
But I still think it lacks the immortality that other soldier forts, such as the ""Eldorado fortress"". Still, a good set and with lots of playing potential.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Matt_the_Cat","2009-08-06T01:01:51.7Z","Very handy, enjoyable set, but not great value.","Most of my colleagues have described this set with flourishing detail, so I don't need to repeat what has already been said.  

What you see is pretty much what you get...four individual, very different modules that, through traditional grey pegs, constitute a soldiers' fort.  Mmm, well, perhaps an outpost, as everyone else has astutely pointed out.  

Once built, you have in your hot little hands a gaol, a palm tree and bridge, a general purpose annex and a HQ/watchtower.  Not to mention, of course, two pirates, three soldiers, the outpost legate, the evil monkey, an articulated crocodile, row boat, cannon and crane.  In addition, there are a decent variety of weapons.  

I am very impressed with the modular design as you can mix and match whenever the mood suits you, and, by itself, the outpost is wonderful to gaze upon and model.  

However, for AU$79.99 this is NOT good value.  I picked it up on sale for AU$64, and, though somewhat better, it is still not ideal.  For AU$50-55, yes.  

Despite the issues with value for the Soldiers' Fort, it is a must have for the Imperial collection as the standout set.  With any other Pirate set, no matter how small, the Soldiers' Fort will compliment it perfectly.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Ge√∏Dav","2009-06-07T10:49:18.06Z","A fantastic Imperial port","I ordered this set about a month ago, and just got around to building it (I've been holding it as an incentive to finish my exam studies :P). I've had my eye on the Pirates sets since we first heard about them, and when we saw the first images of the new pirates series, this was the set that stood out. As a result I had high expectations for this set and I think it met them. There are a number of feature to this set that i really enjoyed that I will discuss below.

Minifigs:
-Admiral
-3 Officers/Soldiers
-Pirate Captain
-Pirate Prisoner

Accessories/Tools:
-2 Cutlasses
-2 Muskets
-2 Pistols
-Torch
-Telescope
-Monkey, Fish, Crocodile
-Cannon
-Chest of Gold Coins
-3 Gemstones (Emerald, Ruby, Diamond)
-Barrel
-Banana
-2 Keys
-Barrel of Dynamite
-2 Oars
-3 Small Flags (1 pirate; 2 soldier)
-Large Soldiers' Flag

The build was nothing challenging at all, but fun nevertheless. The pieces were sorted into modular bags, a method that can be sometimes condescending sometimes appreciated. I didn't particularly mind it this time. The minifigs are a good variety, each soldier looks different. I would have liked another pirate to be included (to even out the sides), but it's good enough for the size and price of the set. The crocodile and the monkey are superb additions too. There are a few stickers included, but they all seem to fit in really well with the set and there aren't so many as to be annoying. I love the bricks showing on the Spanish style tower and prison, and the cobwebs and Roman numerals in the prison cell.

The set is divided into five section that are built separately: a) the Captain's boat; b) the palm tree and bridge; c) the prison cell and cannon; d) the dock; and e) the tower and crane. This layout is really sensible in construction, and you can easily rearrange the different components to model the fort to your liking. I was surprised by how much open dock there was in the finished model - it didn't look so spacious in the LegoShop's pictures. I like the little wooden bridge, which is simply designed but works really well, and I also like that the back wall of the prison is removable. I would have liked the Captain's boat to look more like the one in 6267 Lagoon Lock-up, but it's adequate the way it is. In addition the rotating cannon and crane really add to the playability of this set. The cannon has a surprising firing range, though is a little difficult to aim.

Overall, the design of the fort is simple, but effective and looks good with other previous pirate series sets (I have a couple of the old '96 series). I really like this set, and recommend it to fans of the Pirates series of sets. It's inspired me to look into getting a couple more of the sets in the current Pirates release.

"SaintElsewhere","2009-02-12T22:24:28.84Z","Well, not quite a fort per se.","Like I said, this set gives off more of an outpost vibe. The fact that this is classified as a fort is a little silly. (And I'm talkin' Monty Python silly, which is a new level of silly.) Other than the obvious fact that is nowhere CLOSE to the older forts, I still like it. Six figs, new dynamite piece, and the elusive monkey, not to mention BROWN rowboat, treasure, cannon, and a croc. Not bad.

Pros:
a whole army of soldiers
exclusive admiral/governor
new TNT piece 
MONKEY!
CROC!

Mr. F is right, this is much more of an 'outpost' than a fort. Although of all the pirate sets, this one has the most rebuild potential and could easily be modified into some kind of fortified building.

Lego are really getting into the 'modular' building idea, with this set featuring four parts that can be rearranged in many ways. For some reason the corner piece with the shelter has connector pieces on the side with the wall as well, even though this would just create an inconvenient wall down the middle of the walkway. Although to be fair the wall could be easily removed or placed somewhere else.

With any luck, Lego will add more connectible pieces to this outpost in later sets.

The one major niggle I have with this set is the palm tree. Why ditch the old-style palm tree pieces in favour of this big palm-tree mould? Oh well... I guess the final result is exactly the same anyway. Even though I was really looking forward to building a palm tree myself.

I'm giving this set five stars regardless because of the memories it brings back. One of my favourite sets as a kid was Sabre Island, which has a very similar tower to the one in this set. This is also the only new pirate set with a brown rowboat, a large Imperial flag and the Admiral character. The red bricks on the walls are stickers, but I'm not one of those people who minds stickers. The dynamite, fish and crane are some nice extras.

As I said before, this has the pirate set with the largest rebuild potential, which is why I make an allowance for the palm tree.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"brixton","2009-10-16T10:02:04.123Z","One of the best recent Pirate sets","The soldiers fort looks absolutely amazing.  I am not a big fan of stickers but the stickers in this set add great detail to the fort.  The set wouldn't be as great without the stickers in my opinion.  Having a wanted poster of brickbeard is a nice touch.  I'm not exactly sure what the purpose of the crane is but it doesn't detract from the set in any way.  I also love the fact that the cannons fire the cannons placed inside.  Sometimes it takes a few tries.

You get four soldiers in this set.  One has a torch, one has a feater in his hat and the outpost commander doesn't seem to be well armed.  The interior of the tower is bare and could use some furniture.  I don't think much would fit in there though.  The monkey holding the key is a nice element of this set.  You also get two pirates and a boat filled with dynamite.  

There are some issues with this set.  I cannot put the crocodile together.  The connection piece that makes up his mouth appears to be too small to connect with the body.  This appears to be a very poorly designed figure on legos part.  I thought maybe this was a defect with this particular set but after purchasing a another lego set with a crocodile I had the same problem.  I have come to hate lego crocodiles.
