No stickers! :) 
Cool Shark
An inside part

Mermaid!

Epensive

"RangerFett","2008-11-30T22:19:05.247Z","It's 1989 again!... almost...","I got the Black Seas Barracuda for Christmas in 1989.  I saw this set at TRU on Friday and couldn't resist.
Brickbeard's Bounty sure does bring back great memories of the Black Seas Barracuda. (...AFOLs just won't be able to NOT compare this to the iconic first Lego pirate ship... bear with me here)
But it is NOT the Barracuda.

It's got some great features.  
- The big one - spring loaded cannons are back. Yay! (go buy more cannons, set 6239)
- The cabin is much roomier and cooler than the previous '89/'02 one.  And the &quot;hidden&quot; space beneath the cabin is kinda neat.
- Big sharks that can actually gobble up mini figures... too cool.
- A mermaid up front.  Nice touch.
- Fantastic color scheme, gold and dark red, nice highlights all around.  And a decent asssortment of figures; the upgrade to the pirates' and soldiers' deco is really nice.  Really neat design highlights; the crossed sabers decorating the stern is cool.
Lots of room for adventure and figures all around the ship.  Overall it has the look and feel of the old Barracuda.  Red Beard would be proud, aargh.

However, Lego really cut down on the parts for this set.
Compare this one's 592 pieces with the Barracuda's 865 (or 896 in 2002).
- The masts and rigging are done on the cheap.
- The sails... hmmm.  The skulls on 'em will most likely appeal to the kids.  Solidly made of good material, though.
- The &quot;crane&quot; is dissapointing.
- The hull (bow and stern) is very different than the Barracuda.  I like that they use the same parts; you can get several and make taller hulls.  But it shows Lego making shortcuts again.  Mixed feelings on this one.

The two center hull parts are the same as previous pirate and viking ships.  That's right, only two pieces.  This ship is slightly smaller than the Barracuda. (for about the same price as 6 years ago... and almost 300 pieces less)

Still.  Go get one!  This ship is begging to be upgraded with all those other parts you have lying around.  Lots of potential for modifications.  And its a great starter set for new collectors.
Your fleet just has to have one.*

"Lost_Cosmonaut","2009-01-01T00:01:09.623Z","I'm in love!","Unfortunately, when I was a kid, no matter how much I coveted the Pirates sets, I never ended up with anything more than a few of the smaller ones.  OH how I longed for those huge sailing ships with shooting cannons!  Best I had to settle with was playing with the ones my friends had.

When it was announced that LEGO would be resurrecting the Pirates theme, I was a little apprehensive but excited at the same time.  Most resurrections they've done as of late have been mostly disappointing with a heavy emphasis on the 'Duploization' of parts for easy assembling, removing all the building value the old parts heavy sets used to have.  Fortunately, it seems LEGO is coming to it's senses and attempting to get away from the Duploization in themes, but I wasn't holding out much hope for the resurrected Pirates theme.

But let me tell you, this ship blew me away.  First of all: The return of shooty cannons.  I thought these things were long gone.  As we all know, shooty cannons disappeared when the Pirates theme was last resurrected in the early 2000s, and it was one of the biggest disappointments I had as that was probably one of the best features the old Pirates sets had.  Second thing that blew me away: Modular, non Duploized design, akin to the old ships.  As cool as floating ship hulls are for LEGO's modern ships, one of the BEST things about the old Pirates sets was being able to acquire a few full ship sets and then rebuild them into something special.  I remember my friends having huge three decked, 6+ cannon 3 mast monsters that were incredibly realistic, with cabins and cargo holds and the whole nine yards of super-detailed Pirates goodness.  So I was extremely glad to see that LEGO went the same direction with the new ship, and I hope they release more ships!!

PROS:

- It's AWESOME
- SHOOTY CANNONS! And they have a great new color scheme!
- Modular design so you can use old Pirates ships and other parts to expand
- Cloth sails!
- Tons of great looking figures!  And a mermaid!
- MONKEY!  AND A MULTI-COLORED PARROT!
- New vinyl pirate flag is MUCH nicer than the old tiny wavy flags
- Great color scheme
- AWESOME NEW SHARK!  It can actually eat dudes!
- A ton of play value
- Overall a GREAT design!

CONS:

- Sorry excuse for a crane.
- A nice cargo hold under the Captian's cabin that's kinda hard to access.
- The sail rigging is overly simple and leaves a lot to be desired.
- How exactly do you get to the top deck?

All-in-all this is a great set.  All of the cons are easily fixable with a large parts cache and a little imagination.  Hopefully we will see more and larger ships come out of this theme.  I know I'll buy every one!  And let's all hope the new Space Police III theme does as well re-imagining the old themes as well as this one does!

Overall, I gave this 4/5.  It would have been 5/5 had the sails been better rigged and it had been given an actual crane.  In actuality, I feel it's more of a 4.6, since those complaints are relatively minor in the face of such awesomeness.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-12-26T22:16:53.873Z","Hoorah!","The return of the old time pirate sets are back. Sort of. This set has an old time design, but contains updated pieces and modern building techniques. It has a good variety of minifigs and weapons, as well as three shooting cannons that now have a metallic look. The main cabin includes a stool and a table with map and goblet, while the very lower cabin has a canister of some kind and a mouse. The ship is of large size, and the characters include two imperial soldiers, one damsel in distress, a mermaid, a new shark, a monkey, and a couple of pirates. My major issue with this set is that it only has a little over 500 pieces, yet is somehow 100 dollars. Wwaaaayyyy overpriced. Thank goodness it was a christmas present. ",FALSE,4,4,4,3,3
"pdcarson","2008-12-27T20:42:45.89Z","The first of hopefully many","First off here's to hoping LEGO pirates do enough business to warrant some more new models.  This set is the second to last one I'll need to complete my 2009 collection and I'm hoping for more.  It was very fun build as its the first ship of the pirate theme I've owned - drooled over the Barracuda back in 89 but as I was one broke kid.  On to the +/- lists

Pro
- great mini figure count - love the damsel in distress and the mermaid.
- Shark is awesome.
- the cabin is very detailed and a GREAT color scheme.
- the lanterns on the stern of the ship and the boat are very nice.

Con
- The crane is a joke - great for modeling not so much for the play factor
- only 2 canons below deck with 4 canon &quot;windows&quot;  for $100.00 I'd expect four canons.
- The tubes used for the sails are a bit flimsy


Overall a great ship and one well worth the money for any pirate fan.  Buy it.  9.0/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CCOOK","2008-12-05T21:38:54.06Z","A decent ship","This set is certainly better than the previous pirate ship (Red Beard Runner) and its hull is roughly the same size.  The ship makes good use of some of the newer and better bricks that have come out since 10-15 years ago, and the minifigures are far more detailed than any of the ones on the older pirate ships.  The cabin is very detailed and looks good, and the sails are also nice.  The bow and stern sections are different from all of the old 16-stud pirate ships, and on this ship are identical pieces (two pieces stacked - you'll have to see it).  The two mid sections are the same ones that have come with every other 16-stud pirate ships.  The firing cannons are really nice and are a dark sparkly grey color, and the shark is great - it can swallow a minifigure!  Too bad we can't order more of those sharks separately from a catalogue.

My only complaints are that there's no rope run through the masts and especially the flimsy tubes used to hold the sails up - the older ships all used stacked 1 x &quot;X length&quot; bricks to attach the sails to the masts - why couldn't this one do the same?

Overall a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mgmad","2009-11-19T20:16:16.75Z","Good, but not really good enough","This ship is good, but it's not really up to the standards of previous pirate ships (much like most of the new line, actually). It does have some nice detail around the stern and cabin, but it lacks any sort of fo'castle in the bow, where the mounted muskets are, making them a bit useless. Also a bit disappointing not to see any kind of rigging, the mast and sails are probably the biggest let down. Also, is it just me, or is the quality of plastic on modern Lego not quite as it used to be? This was the first new Lego set I'd bought in quite a while, and it just seems cheaper than the old stuff to me.

On the plus side, the new shark is nice and the figurehead is quite good too. The wench is a nice touch, and will be going on our wedding cake as a topper ;)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2009-03-27T22:47:00.903Z","Shiver me timbers!","   I bought this set at a small toy store two minutes away a couple days ago and when I started building I didn't come up for the rest of the evening! (True story.)

The Build:
   The build took me roughly three or four hours. I was amazed by the amount of pieces and sheer size of this puppy. Structurally, the ship is sound as a bell, with a removable captain's cabin and top deck. The design is also pretty accurate and the figurehead, cargo net, mounted muskets, and cannon on the top deck really make it brilliant. One problem though, there's no anchor.

The Figures:
   Seven minifigures. (Nine including the monkey and mermaid.) What's not to love? Brickbeard, two Soldiers, three generic pirates, and the Governor's daughter. Then there's also the mermaid and the monkey. The only problem is that there aren't exactly enough weapons to go around.

Overall:
   The figs, ship, shark, accessories, and weapons all amount to a 5/5. The lack of anchor and enough weapons to go around bring this down to a 4.8/5, but 4.8/5 rounds up to 5/5, so I give it 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"GerbilLord_3_14159","2009-01-15T10:14:18.483Z","Return of the pirates!","     My favorite LEGO theme was pirates from the 90's, so it goes without saying that I am thrilled with the themes return. I have most of the new pirate line, and I feel that this is the best by far. It has the return of the firing cannons, something missed by all LEGO fans, a great color scheme that makes you feel like this ship really is owned by a pirate living in the lap of luxury, and of course, the INCREDIBLY detailed bodies.
     The color scheme is one of my favorite things about this set, because if you compare it to the 90's equivalent, it looks stunning. LEGO has used almost ENTIRELY new colors, such as metallic dark grey cannons, pearl gold details on the captain's cabin, dark red throughout the ship, dark beige and dark brown on the gun-ports. These little details make it look truly amazing.
     The minifigures are great- what pirate is complete without a gold hook-hand, an eye-patch, and a peg-leg? The governors daughter and the mermaid are great, female figs are harder to find. The pirates are good, but the real stars of the series are the marines(guys in red coats), with their absolutely wonderful torsos, greatly improved hats and new feathers, they are my favorite thing of the series(along with the Admiral).
     All in all, Im very impressed with LEGO with this set, and I hope to see the pirate line expand, especially to include sailors, maybe give them and the marines a ship. You should without a doubt buy this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I love the colors, the attention to small details. Great set to own and build. I enjoyed every moment of the build and could not help but stop in between to admire the design.

I am sure that this ship (hopefully, one of many more) will be my favorite. I do not feel like taking it apart. Go out and get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Despite a few minor niggles, I'm not disappointed. The ship looks beautiful. I've set it up in a diorama fighting off a couple of navy longboats. I want to leave it like that forever. But I can't, because I want to take it apart and build it all over again.

I'm giving it five stars because, even if the mast is flimsy and the crane is pointless, it gives me five stars worth of happiness.

Now I guess I'll have to wait another year for a matching navy ship...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Joe US military fan, I have to support the Pirates when I say they make a kraken of a great ship! For my birthday, I decided to purchase the LAST Brickbeard's Bounty at my local Value Drugs store. This drugstore is awesome! It gets brand new LEGO sets every month! They have had the largest Star Wars to City to Indiana Jones to Duplo to Pirates to Technic to Creator to Bionicle ;(, and more! And when I went on November 20 of 2009, I saw they had 2 Brickbeard Bounties and 2 of those ole' Space Police Galatic Enforcers! All at a retail price of $99.99! A drugstore, for medicines and little trinket toys, sells 100-dollar LEGO sets! I mean MEGA Bloks would have been more common, but having a local LEGO dealership only 6 minutes of walking away, even less, is great! Now, when I opened that set, I just started RIPPING pieces out! Instructions booklets then ship hulls then flags then little parts! It took me 1.75 hours to complete, and now for the grandest moment, here is my pros and cons list!<br/>Pros:<br/><br/>*8 grand mini-figures!

The whole whole thing is just so great, I have LIMITED CONS!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>The Imperials get a little untreated. I mean LEGO could of made a little larger of a boat, like a patrol boat, and have a great fight with that! But then of course, the price would bump up, and I got this set for 20% off!<br/>The pirate skulls can get a little repetative, a pattern like swords and two guns or something could of been a supplement, but that has no major impact!<br/><br/>When I went on LEGO Shop last night to look at their Pirates sets, the BB was listed as ""Hard to Find"". All the sets were! The two great impulse sets were discontinued! Pirates is supposedely ending this August, but there is that rumor that LEGO is returning with a bang in 2011, but having the grand chance to have this terrific set at my local drugstore is the best thing for a LEGO fan! Did I mention it was the LAST one there? It amazes me that a drugstore can have the set you always wanted, while LEGO Shop does not!<br/>And just as a reminder for all Pirates fans, the January 2009 wave of Pirates sets will stop production starting August 1, and the Imperial Flagship is rumored to end its productions next January!
