<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Boring. I see no interest in these whatsoever.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Primo parts are pretty much non-reusable, and besides, there's only four.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I'm not sure if you can really count this as a minifig, but okay. At least he's Danish plastic.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>There is no build. All you do is stick two one-piece cars on the end of a one-piece engine.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It's not a model for the same reasons mentioned above.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Unless you're a collector of rare sets like @Istokg, I would not advise buying this. It's not really a set. I only hold on to it for sentimental value (and the pleasure of being one of eight owners of the set).</p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
