Wow, the only thing that can make this set even more awesome is a little bit of modding.  You can get the extra parts on bricklink for just a few bucks...

1) In the original prototype, this set was supposed to include 1930's gangster-style tommy guns, but those are currently only available in the Batman sets.  They are part #x1608.  They totally jazz up the whole look and feel of the set!

2) You can add a fence or bars right behind the drivers of the gangster car, to make it like a paddy wagon with a cell in the back.  The crisscross fence is part #3185, and jail bars are part #30055.

3) Finally, you can add two trapezoidal flags, part #bb112, to the front of the gangster's car to make it match the style of the other Indy vehicles.

I will also post a mod for Indy's Jeep, the Jungle Cruiser, #20004.

Fortune and Glory!

Five figures, all currently unique to this set. The two cars are detailed and use interesting techniques in their construction; they are also recognisable as the vehicles in the movie, an impressive achievement at this scale.

For a very long time, I cherrised for a Temple of Doom Lego set, and now it is the time to shine. The first LEGO Temple of Doom set is one of the best in the LEGO Indiana Jones series.

PROS:

*Extremly movie-accurate!
*Contains 5 mini-figures! (The ones that were exact to the scene!)
*Short Round's torso was given a great improvement! (In the prototype released last August, Shorty had a blue torso, which wasn't the movie-accuray from the scene in TOD. Thanks, LEGO, for giving Short Round a great torso!)
*Cars are easy to build, and fun to make!
*The 1st set to include Indy in tux, and him with hair! (Although it would be okay if it didn't, I have a piece of brown hair from my City min-fig collection that would make the match. But still, its great that the designer of this set thought of this before the final pic was released.)

CONS:

*$30 is a bit high for the content of this GREAT set. Maybe a Club Obi-Wan added in would make $30 a pretty awesome price!

"lotographia","2009-02-25T04:24:03.937Z","A beautiful symmetry.","I sometimes have difficulty explaining how the various Indiana Jones sets are supposed to interact with each other. So I've got this temple in Egypt, and it's standing next to a temple in Peru, and in the future they'll be joined by a temple in India. Geographically, this will never make any sense.

Other lego ranges are much easier to explain. The pirate ship is attacking the imperial fort. The imperial soldiers are raiding the pirate hideout. The pirate raft is searching for the treasure island. There's hardly any pirate sets that can't join the story.

That's why I like these Indiana Jones vehicle sets. Cars can very easily make a story involving other cars. Or trucks, or motorcycles, or planes. Indiana Jones is one big chase scene involving any number of cars you could wish to collect.

Not only are the vehicles in this set artfully designed, all the minifigs are unique as well. And there are more minifigs than you could reasonably use in the set, since Short Round just looks silly in the boot, which is where the instructions suggest you place him.

If I were to recommend any Indiana Jones set to someone, it would be this one. Not because it has much in common with the other Indiana Jones sets, because it doesn't, but because it's a perfect unit in itself. The protagonists in their evening wardrobe and cream car being chased by the gangsters in their evil dark van. There's a beautiful kind of symmetry to it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MandalorianCandidate","2009-04-16T07:58:21.483Z","No time for love, Dr. Jones!","I want to preface my review with a few comments, so please indulge me…

2008 started out really great for the Indiana Jones Lego line.  Not only did we get some of the most iconic scenes from Raiders of the Lost Ark in Lego form, but we had some cool additions from the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull movie.  Perhaps Lego set the bar a little too high, as the January 2009 sets really pale in comparison.

In thinking about the concept of Indiana Jones sets as a whole, there’s definitely a challenge to deliver sets that will ‘fit’ with each other.  It’s pretty simple with the City, Castle, Vikings, and Harry Potter lines to deliver cohesiveness as they pretty much all can be combined and displayed within a space that makes sense.  The HP sets are designed around Hogwarts and nearby locals and have a similar look to them so naturally they work well together.  The Indy ones are spread out:  we have sets depicting a South American temple, an Egyptian tomb, and a German motorcycle depot.  The Crystal Skull sets are an exception as they are all designed around the Jungle scenes from the movie.

That being said, the Shanghai Chase, like the 7620 Indy Motorcycle Chase, is sort of an orphan set.  I can see why it was made, yet there probably won’t be any companion pieces for it to play off of.  The cars definitely could be useful for modding for other (non-Indy) settings but in the Indy universe they will probably be loners.

The only reason for me to get this set (besides that I had a Target coupon) was the minifigs as they are the most unique and, hence, valuable part.  Finally an Indy besides the regular, fedora-wearing variety (OK, they did throw one in to make him more rugged, even though it doesn’t show up in the movie until he gets onto the plane)!  I’m hoping that Lego follows their Indy game and starts making varieties of Indiana Jones minifigs.  However, the largest splash here is the Willie Scott in nightclub dress minifig.  I dig that it is a verbatim copy of the Lego Indy videogame and a thumbs up for the two-faced minifig head.  I don’t remember the tiara (the set has an extra one), but it adds some variety.  Another plus is the diamond Willie picks up from the Obi-Wan nightclub, though she does have an antidote vial in the car instead (picky, I know).

Other minifigs:  Short Round is actually short (Yoda legs), which makes him tough to place in the car as the driver.  It would have been cool to print the cap with the Yankees ‘NY’ logo like the one from the movie.  The other two minifigs, the gangster twins, are a necessary but nice add on, but I would have preferred to have a Lao Che (the head gangster) minifig instead of one of the baddies.  The grinning one is sort of disturbing looking to me, kind of reminding me of the scarecrow grin from Batman.

The two cars are pretty well reproduced from the movie or at least from the 30’s era.  I’m not much of a car buff so I won’t try to deduce what models they are supposed to be, but Indy’s is more of a coupe with a rumble seat, while the black car is a ‘sedan’ with a back seat.  Not much else to say about them except that they use the 6x5x2 car seat unit without opening doors.  It’s a nice piece to fill out the front seat but I like the idea of individual seats and opening doors.  It’s tough to fit all three in Indy’s car up front, but cleverly, designers put an slot in the trunk section for one figure to stand in.  The trunk or rumble seat, depending on how you use it (mine is storing Indy’s fedora and the bonus pistol right now), is also a nice touch.  I like the cloth canopy piece with the cut out hole allowing Indy to shoot out the top but if not installed tightly it sags.  The baddies’ car has a removable top allowing for access to the ‘backseat.’  Another feature are the two vertical ‘grab bars’ allowing the gangsters to lean out of the car while holding on.  Besides the nice and authentic look of the cars, they have a couple of complex parts.  Indy’s front grill is a new piece only available in two other sets, one being the 7622 Desert Chase.  An interesting hood ornament made from a silver Sarlaac’s tooth is also present along with tail and headlights.  There are fenders, each car having two unique pairs, which also differ between the cars.

What I described here sounds pretty good, and it is executed well, but I feel that for the price it’s just not enough.  There are a number of unique pieces and definitely not much repetitious building, but for $30 it just doesn’t feel like a whole lot is there.  Once I saw it assembled on my display shelf I thought ‘huh’ and that’s it.  At a little over 12 cents per part, it’s not a bargain at all.  I’m thinking a $25 price tag would be more like it, which is about what I ended up paying.  

The bottom line is this:  if you only want the minifigs, wait for a Target sale or clearance, but if money is no object then knock yourself out.

Box : 3/5
Waaaaaay too BIG. The CGI art is fine and standard, at the back is the close-up of the set and there's a 1:1 picture of minifigs at the top. However, if they could make the box smaller (1/3 of the original box is enough for the parts), maybe they could bash the price down by 5% to 15%

Instructions : 4/5
Standard instructions, with pics of Indy sets back to last year and present at the back pages, plus a form for a free 2 year subscription of LEGO Magz.

Building : 5/5
Clear enough, building both Indy's Car and the gangsters' van are nice. Should be able to finish within 40 minutes, at the most.

Minifigs : 5/5
This is the priority reason for me to buy this set. You got 5 RARE minifigs, 3 interseting and 2 not-so-nice. Short Round, you have a short leg and a Chinese-styled torso. Indiana, you got a white tux torso, and a choice between hair and hat. Willie, you have a nice blonde hair with a slot for crown. The gangsters, well, as is. They do, however, have differenet face expressions and Indy's fedora with black color.

Playability : 4/5
You can replay the chase part on Shanghai, hide Short Round inside the back part of Indy's car, and put Indy inside the cell at the back of gangsters' car. There aren't any can-be-shot weapons, however.

Display : 5/5
Very nice for displaying, 2 cars at a hot race.

Compare with Money : 1/5
In the US this set is priced for US$ 30, in Indonesia it is priced for IDR 900,000 or equal to US$ 78.3, or roughly 2 and a half times the US price.

Overall : 4/5
Pretty good set, you got Indy in a white tux, Willie, and Short Round. There are 2 vehicles, one a van and another a sedan. Both of them are totally vintage. There is a slot for Short Round at the back of sedan and a cell for one or two people at the back of the van. You can put Indy standing backward through the sedan's canvas roof, but the roof can't be folded perfectly, so part of Indy's face will be covered. An expensive set, you may buy this if you go for the minifigs, or if you're a fan of Dr. Henry Jones, Jr.

The minifigs you get are all new, nightclub Indy, Willie Scott, Short Round, and 2 gangsters. Indy has a new suit torso, which will be useful in mocing, and he has a hairpiece and a hat, Willie has a nice torso, and double sided head, new hairpiece and a tiara, it also has an extra one, but is pretty much useless since no other minifigs have a hole in their hair for it. Short Round Has a new torso that can be a beggar or pirate, and a white ball cap. It should have a Yankees symbol on it, but Lego would need a copyright for it. And finally the gangsters have a new suit piece, and black fedoras. They should of thrown in Lao Che, but that's okay. one of the gangsters has a maniacal smile, and the other one has a smirk. 

The cars a nice, but simple. and are useful in a lot of other themes (with a little modding) like city, or a town. 

The gangsters limo is nice. It gas a black 1 piece seat section, and a spot in the back for 1 or 2 more minifigs. It has handles on the side to place a gangster on to shoot at the other car. 

Short Rounds car is a nice old Duesenberg  or something on that order. It has a flap in the rook so Indy can fall through. It is hard (but possible) to get all three in the car, but Lego added a spot in the back for Short Round.

I just got this set today at Wal-Mart. It's spendy for its size but AWSOME. It comes with 4 figs exclusive to this set(4 because Short Round is in the new temple of doom set). The cars are very detailed - especially Lao Che's - and you can really recreate the whole scene. The build of the black car is similar to the truck in the Raiders chase set.

"vynsane","2010-05-26T14:52:41.873Z","For crying out loud, there's a kid driving the car!","<div>Toward the end of my 'dark age' one thing that kept piquing my interest in LEGO was the Indiana Jones license. As a lover of the films they played no small part in bringing me back into the LEGO world.</div><h4>Figures</h4><div><ul><li><b>Indiana Jones</b> - Decked out in his finest dinner jacket and tuxedo pants, Dr. Jones looks more like a certain super-spy than he does his usual self here (in accordance with the scene in the movie, of course).</li><li><b>Willie Scott</b> - The 'famous American female vocalist' who somehow ends up in Lao Che's Club Obi Wan, and accompanies Indy on his latest adventure is done superb justice in her red and gold sequined dress THAT SHE GOT IN PARIS! Willie's head comes with an alternate 'panic mode' print on the back-side.</li><li><b>Short-round</b> - Indy's faithful boy wonder drives the tan Dueseberg in spectacular fashion through the streets of Shanghai.</li><li><b>Lao Che henchman</b> (w/mustache) - Looking the part of Lao Che himself, minus the pointy side-burns, this guy is decked out in full gangster regalia, complete with black dress shirt and white tie.</li><li><b>Lao Che henchman</b> (w/maniacal grin) - Reusing the same torso as the first henchman, this guy's face has 'psychopath' written all over it.</li></ul></div><h4>Accessories</h4><div>Like most Indy sets, there are a few 'revolver' style handguns, but there are plenty other items as well.</div><div><ul><li><b>Revolver</b> (x3) - one each assigned to the two henchmen and Indy (although, Indy's is quickly thrown out the window of the car when he hands it to Willie).</li><li><b>Fedora</b> (brown) - Even though Indy didn't put it on until he was 'safely' aboard the plane out of Shanghai, it's included in this set (as is a standard Brown hairpiece).</li><li><b>Fedora</b> (black, x2) - ONLY available in this set!</li><li><b>Baseball Cap</b> (white) - It SHOULD have blue pinstripes and a NY Yankees logo on it, but I'm not sure they've ever even printed designs on the baseball cap.</li><li><b>Jewel</b> (translucent clear) - The diamond Indy received from Lao in exchange for Nirhachi.</li></ul></div><h4>Parts</h4><div>The 5-stud-wide 'passenger bucket' piece (used in most of the cars from the 'Adventurers' line) is employed on both cars to great effect. Other than that, they're comprised of relatively run-of-the-mill bricks and plates, save for the odd piece that you wouldn't expect but are used in ingenious ways.</div><h4>Build</h4><div>The build is rather straight-forward for the most part with some clever nuances used to create the shapes necessary for a 1930's style car, like the use of trapezoidal flags for the front fenders of the Duesenberg, or other hinged and curved pieces to really sculpt the details. It's unfortunate that the tan car is only a two-seater, as it at least accommodates four comfortably in the movie, but Indy can stand in the 'rumble seat' in the back to ward off the bad guys while Short-round drives and Willie panics. I have to admit, I love a good two-figure wide car, as evidenced by my bricklist ""A car built for two (or more)"". But enough shameless self-promotion.</div><div>The bad guys' car is a cross between a sedan and a truck, due to its height. There is more than enough room in the back to accommodate at least two prisoners, should the henchmen catch their quarry in your alternate play universe.</div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>A perfect rendition of a great scene from a fantastic movie - what's not to love? The fact that you get two cars, five rare (four exclusive!) minifigures and 244 pieces for $30 from a licensed set is really great. Somehow I was able to grab this from Amazon after it had been discontinued and paid less than retail for it ($28 - free shipping!) so you might be lucky enough as well.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

<p>- Two awesome and realistic cars</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The builds on both cares were fairly solid and it was fun to put these together and the detailing that went into them to try and look like cars used from the movie. Very period pieces for the models.</p>

 <b><a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?O=7682-1"">Box:</a></b></p>
<p>
 The box is as usual, just show casing the set and the action scene on the front. Also shows the play functions on the back side.</p><p><br></p>
<p>
 <b><a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=7682-1"">Parts:</a></b></p>
<p>
 Some of the parts included in this set are quite cool. Such as the figure parts and some of their accessories. <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=85718"">The fabric piece</a> that sits on Short Round's vehicle is quite neat and does add some accuracy. Also for the fact that they have the 'cut out' for Short Round's car, where Indy and Willie fall through. This piece does only appear in this set. There are no stickers in this set, however there are no detailed or otherwise known as 'printed' pieces' in this set, which I find a little lame.</p><p><br></p>
<p>
 <b>Build:</b></p>
<p>
 The build was really fun and quite interesting for both vehicles actually. Personally, I found Short Round's car more engaging and fun to build, but the&nbsp;villain's vehicle was also quite nice to build, also has a very clean and old fashion look to it. There wasn't anything difficult or unexpected, the fabric piece was a little annoying, lining the holes up and making the folds and stuff like that, which some people find fascinating, so I wouldn't really say that this is a complaint. There was no stickers in this set, which also made the build process a lot faster. This set took me half an hour/30 min to assemble.</p><p><br></p>
<p>
 <b>Characters:</b></p>
<p>
 <b>- <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=iaj024"">Indiana Jones (tuxedo)</a>: </b>Indiana Jones in this outfit in unique to this set, he appears at the start of the TOD movie, at the night club. He does come with both his hat and his hair piece, which seems to be one of few sets to include that. His face is the same as all the other Indy figures though and he does come with a grey pistol. A real down side to this set is that this is one of the only sets that Indy DOES NOT come with his whip, which I know a lot of people look forward to.</p>
<p>
 <b>- <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=iaj026"">Willie Scott (dancing outfit)</a>:</b> You can get Willie in 2 sets, the TOD play set and this one. The other set Willie appears in her&nbsp;pajamas, but in this set she comes in her dancing outfit. The printing on her is actually quite&nbsp;satisfying and the fact that she has an exclusive her piece that has a hole in it. The hole is supposed to hold her red crown, which she wears in the movie as well. For 2012 this may not seem too advanced, but for 2009 when this set was released, it was above and beyond the standard. She does also come with a clear diamond element.</p>
<p>
 <b>- <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=iaj025"">Short Round</a>:</b> He is the driver of the really cool car in the movie. We do generally refer to it as 'Short Round's car', but I don't think it's actually his car. Anyway he is a really cool figure and does come in 2 sets. Unfortunately no printing on his hat for extra detail.</p>
<p>
 <b>- <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=iaj027"">Gangster No.1 (moustache)</a>:</b>&nbsp;In the movie, he is the leader of the other Gangsters and he was the one making the deals with Indy, so I would assume he is the leader. He does come with a grey pistol.</p>
<p>
 <b>- <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=iaj028"">Gangster No. 2 (grin)</a>:</b> This character does look a little bit like the Joker (without his make up) as far as the Lego character turned out. He does also come with a grey pistol, even though in the movie he was holding a tommy gun. The 2 villains are exclusive to this set.</p><p><br></p>
<p>
 <b>Set:</b></p>
<p>
 <b>- The Villain car:</b> Very nice, clean look to it and I really like the way it turned out. Seat for 3 figures, 2 in the front and 1 in the back, as prison maybe. The roof does come off and that's how you would access your figures, very cool again. They could of added some detailed pieces, because the vehicle looks kind of plain and I just wish it had a little more to it. The car also turned out a bit smaller than I expected.</p>
<p>
 <b>&nbsp;Short Round's car:</b> This vehicle is very well designed and pretty much as accurate as it could get. Could of had some detailed piece as I've mentioned before, but still looks pretty close to what actually appears in the movie. The fabric is a really cool design and looks pretty accurate, although it can get quite annoying and I wouldn't really recommend using the flap either. Short Round's car is a bit tight and quite hard to fit 3 people without using the flap, However I have found a solution to that. There is also a storage behind the seating area, which is referred to as the trunk. The trunk can't really fit anyone as it says on the box, so that's false advertising right there. The vehicle itself is a bit smaller than what I thought it was going to be, since on the box it looks massive. The cars could of had a little more&nbsp;play-ability, since this set has no proper play function. <br></p><p><br></p>
<p>
 <b>Summary:</b></p>
<p>
 I think at the end, this set is fantastic, but there are quite a few big down sides to this set which I find disappointing. As far as Indiana Jones, TOD is one of my favorite movies out of the other ones, but they could of done a bit more on the set. This set was originally $30 back in 2009, so you should be able to find one for $40-$45 bucks if you are looking for one. This set is pretty cool, but probably not the best Indiana Jones set out there!</p><p><br></p>
<p>
 <b>PROS:</b></p><p>- 2 really accurate vehicles, old looking and quite realistic!
 <br></p><p>- 4 exclusive figures
 <br></p><p>- NO STICKERS!</p><p><br></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>
 <b>CONS:</b>
 <br></p><p>- The fabric cloth piece can be quite annoying at times (especially for putting/taking the figures in/out)
 <br></p><p>- Not enough room for 3 figures in Short Round's car (although I've found a&nbsp;solution) -</p><p>- No&nbsp;play functions
 <br></p><p>- The trunk on Short Round's car can't actually hold a mini figure (false advertisement on box)</p>

"123MrBrick","2019-07-16T00:47:22.803Z","Delivers on what it promises, and quite efficiently.","<p>I&#39;ve reached something of a crossroads regarding my bloated LEGO collection, where I&#39;m no longer sure why I&#39;m holding on to many of the sets I have. Amidst that, I took the time to sort through thousands of very crudely-organized parts to rebuild this set. I think that sums up my feelings on it quite nicely.</p>

<p>While only a decade old, this set comes from a radically different timeframe in regards to LEGO&#39;s design philosophy. The idea wasn&#39;t to make sets that looked like they&#39;d been pulled right out of the screen, but instead to create interpretations of the set&#39;s subject, seen through the lens of LEGO. Nothing in this set is perfectly accurate to the&nbsp;<em>Temple of Doom&nbsp;</em>movie, but all aspects of it are more enjoyable because of it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, a quick note on the build of the set: both cars start with essentially the same base chassis, and then differ from each other over the course of the build. I appreciate that the instructions choose to build the more similar parts of the cars in two different orders to keep things from being monotonous.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures. These are a far cry from today&#39;s offerings. No back printing, only one double face (for Willie). Nevertheless, I think they capture the appropriate charm and essence of these characters better than modern &quot;accurate&quot; figures could. Short Round&#39;s cheerful (and I believe unique, along with his torso) but simple facial expression reflects well on his character, even if it doesn&#39;t look particularly like the actor. The same goes for Willie, whose torso and leg printing was pretty advanced for the time, reminding me of her extravagant costume without actually needing to relive every detail of the ugly thing like a 2019 take on her outfit would. The separate hair and tiara pieces are quite nice as well, while still leaving room for other uses.</p>

<p>The Chinese gangsters look just mean and fitting enough while again still lending themselves to a multitude of other options. And then there&#39;s old Jonesy; I believe his tuxedo torso print remains unique to him as well, but likewise has many uses. The simple hair piece and face print, along with the interchangeable hat, have never looked much like Harrison Ford, but they remind one of the character while staying true to the charming simplicity of LEGO; that is preferable to me.</p>

<p>Additionally, five figures with several new pieces in a $30 set was quite generous at the time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The same concept of my above comments can be applied to the two vehicles as well.</p>

<p>Short Round&#39;s car, for example, should have a much longer hood/nose section, and separate back and front seat areas. The mobster car is just a bit too tall and square in general. However, both vehicles are still good approximations that capture the general idea. This makes them more fun to build and play with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both vehicles have several design flourishes simply there for aesthetics, such as the hinged flaps connected to clips to make fenders. However, their focus remains on being sturdy, playable cars. These two vehicles are supposed to be engaged in a high-stakes chase, and this toy representation fits the bill well.</p>

<p>Both cars are six studs wide, which is my personal favorite width for LEGO vehicles. Short Round&#39;s car has a small trunk area and a removable canvas roof, with an additional hole in it as well for Jones and Scott to &quot;fall&quot; through. The mobster car has a removable roof with a large area in the back for holding cargo, additional goons, or maybe a prisoner. This set has no real play features, and it doesn&#39;t need any. Thankfully none were forced on it. The draw here is being able to recreate an iconic movie scene, as well as the vintage styling of the cars in general.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If this scene were made as a set today, including the same two car designs and nothing else, it would probably be $50, be much more prone to falling apart due to excessive design compromise in the name of accuracy, and I&#39;m sure LEGO would find a way to work in a stud shooter or exploding parts on one of the cars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the best word for this set is &quot;sturdy&quot;. If you&#39;re an Indiana Jones fan, this is the go-to Temple of Doom set. If you like LEGO cars, these 1930&#39;s style vehicles are a fun addition. It&#39;s also just a fun set to pick up and play with. Two sides of a conflict are represented equally, which is a rarity in LEGO sets. There&#39;s a lot of storytelling opportunities with just this set alone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a sturdy set. It&#39;s good. It serves various purposes. Nothing is bad about it, but nothing really stands out about it either. As I said before, it sold for $30 originally, but unless you&#39;re an absolute diehard collector I wouldn&#39;t pay more than $40 or maybe $50 for a used one today. After all, it is just a pair of cars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which is all it needs to be.</p>
