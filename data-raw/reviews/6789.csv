Pros:  Mechanic Torso and new  J. Jonah Jameson Head with brown mustache &amp; eyebrows, awesome dark green cockpit, and huge plane.  Cons:  Not a lot of bricks with this set, truck is really plain and kind of odd, and decals decals decals!  For $50 a little overpriced.  The build gets a 4/10 because of the lack of elements and the decals, the overall set gets a 8/10.  The plane is pretty impressive once it's put together.  I am glad they are doing more classic Indy sets!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"THX_1138","2008-12-27T23:36:49.107Z","Awesome!","I love the flying wing in the movie, and the scene in the movie is also sweet.
Pros:
-The minifigs are good, especially the new German Mechanic. 
-The fuel truck is cool and accurate. Many people are complaining that it is less bulky than the one in the preliminary pics, but it is more accurate to the one in the film.
-The flying wing is cool.
Cons:
-The single wing piece in the flying wing means the wings can't be angled upwards like on the actual design. Some may also find this juniorised (I don't).
-The fuel truck's front is somewhat plain. 
-The plane's controls aren't all that good.  I like the sticker though.
-It has many stickers (I don't mind but some people do).
-Why does Marion have a torch?
This is an awesome set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"swatson","2009-01-06T11:10:58.373Z","A thorough review OR why Marion has a torch. ","Before I dive straight into my review of this set, I would like to explain why Marion has torch. If you remember, Indy and Marion have just managed to escape from the Well of Souls and have just pushed out a large block from a partially excavated second right next to the Flying Wing's service/loading area. Just before they had left the Well of Souls, Marion had been surrounded by dozens of decomposing mummies who did what mummies do best, fall apart all over her. After that I wouldn't be too surprised if she still had a death grip on that torch! Okay, no onto my review.

The fact that this set has seen the light of day gives it an automatic 3 out of 5 no matter what the composition of the set might be. The Indiana Jones line has a very uncertain future with Hasbro having already canceled all future waves of toys and as every day passes it seems that time, not Nazi's or Commies, is the worst enemy of Indiana Jones. That is why it is so nice to see the Indiana Jones line safely in the hands of a great company like Lego. It also helps that it is a very cool set with some nice fairly unique (colored) elements. Also because in my opinion this scene is second only to the desert truck chase, which happens after the flying wing scene, (okay maybe this one is tied with the opening Hovito temple scene for second) in the greatest movie of all time, it would be hard to not expect a set that exudes that same essence of greatness. That adds one more point bringing it to a 4 out of 5 without even opening the box. 

But of course this set ultimately exists for one reason and that is to build it. In anticipation having this set to further the adventures of Indiana Jones, I decided to build a film accurate Lego doppelganger of the scenes surroundings for my son (the wing was a present from me to him for Christmas) which included the partially excavated Well of Souls, tall guard post, multiple tents, and the shack that ""THE"" German wanders out of to see what is going on. After the wing was built it became apparent that the Lego diorama was too small, which surprised me because it is composed of 4 of those massive square building plates that are found on the Lego table and with a fifth one, an old landing plate from an early 1980's set in the center. Let me put it too you another way; this baby is nice and big for what it is. No it's not the UCS Millennium Falcon, or the Death Star but it is on pace with say the T-1 Typhoon or the new style Passenger Plane. 

Finally the composition of this set is fairly straight forward without any epiphany moments like you sometimes get when you finally see how a complex section is built, but it is an enjoyable build with some nice touches. So that gives it its final point making it a total of 5 out of 5.

 So without any further discussion here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
- Finally the German Mechanic mini-figure!
- Nice color scheme even though not movie accurate.
- Some good elements in some good colors.
- Big and impressive to behold.
- Fun to play with!
- Iconic movie, Iconic scene, Iconic plane, Iconic toy company. 'Nuff said!

Cons:
- Replacing the Ark concept with treasure. The movie isn't called Raiders of the Lost Miscellaneous Treasures!?!?! I understand that Lego thinks the ark might confuse kids but by making it about treasure and not the ark confuses me! It sucks.
- Stickers that are difficult to put on unless you are very patient.
- Could have been cheaper but I understand how licensing fees force the price point.
- I would have loved to see this and even paid more to make this a more in-depth set with a much more detailed plane, a guard tower, two ""exploding"" trucks, the maintenance shed, a few tents and gas cans. I can dream can't I?
- Would have paid hundreds for an UCS Version!
- Canopy doesn't open to the side like in the movie.
- Set on its own doesn't offer a lot of pieces for those who have very few sets and are looking to be able to build multiple self-made creations.

One final note. It was hard for me to even write down those cons because I felt like I was ""looking a gift horse in the mouth."" I have wished for this set ever since I was 6 years old when I first saw the movie in the theater and went home and tried to build Indy on my own. I even saved my money as a kid for months and bought the movie back in 1982 when the VHS tapes were $89.99! I wore the tape out! I hope to do the same with this Lego set! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lost_Cosmonaut","2009-01-13T01:02:32.093Z","A great set!","I LOVE THIS SET!  It's not as good as the airplane from 7628, but it's solidly designed and is somewhat accurate to the design, at least as close as they could get it within the part count (there are MOCs that are MUCH closer but probably have a piece count that would have driven over $100).  The truck is a short coming, it at LEAST needed the ""window"" grill from the 7622 truck, and some better fenders.  But in the end, the centerpiece is the Flying Wing, which I'm impressed even got made.  It just looks cool sitting on it's landing gear, or rip the gear off and swoosh it around a little, it's very solid!  And I think this is the first time we've ever seen camouflage on a LEGO!

Pros:

- A design we long hoped for!
- Great features
- Very solid and swooshable
- Minimal stickers for the subject
- Really needs one more ""pilot"" for a gunner, or at least the second mechanic that attacks Indy (at least the motorcycle driver from 7620 works, but his helmet is a different color)
- Cool landing gear design

Cons:

- Non-retracting landing gear.  I was really hoping for this after 7628 was so brilliantly designed with retracting landing gear, but considering we never see the Flying Wing doing anything other than just rotating back and forth on the ground, and the design has nowhere to fit the retracted landing gear, I guess this is the best we could hope for.
- Lack of detail on the underside.  There's a lot of empty ugly space on the underside with vertical surfaces that would make any aeronautical engineer blush that could have easily been fixed by one or two pieces.
- The cargo hatch has a large unsightly gap between it and the canopy, but fixing it probably would have limited the opening of the canopy.
- Very little detail in the turret or the cockpit.  The pilot doesn't even have a control unit of any sort!
- This might bug some people more than me, but the neither the cockpit nor the turret are ""airtight"".  Then again, this is a airplane design that was supposed to be from 1936.

All in all it's a great set.  Between this and 7628, I have high hope that 7198 Fighter Plane Attack will have a decently designed plane (or two?) and hopefully we get more detail than the plane from 7623.  It also gives me hope that the Turkish Tank from Raiders will be done too, but hopefully they render it better in LEGO than Traveller's Tales did in LEGO Indiana Jones the Video Game.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The plane is incredible and has two places for mini figs to sit andeven a cargo hold! The Gas truck is cool and is semi-similar to the 'truck chase' truck. The minifigs are awesome: pilot w/ cool brown helmet; Indy; Marion in dress hlding a strange club(?); mechanic who is way more buff than in 'Raiders'. Everyone says he has a brown mustache and eyebrows but mine came with regular gray ones :-|  This set is great. I like the way the plane is built and it has a wider wingspan than the 'peril in peru' set. a bit overpriced...  Marion could have come w/ chalks instead of a club but i dont know how they could have done that... 9.9/10 only (ONLY) because of the price.

First, the wings are the same piece from the passenger plane set and the plane shouldn't be that big. The cockpit should also be airtight, but this is supposed to be an old plane. Also in the movie, the plane was never green. The fuel truck however, is flawless and with no problems at all. If you are a hard core Indiana Jones fan, get this set.

"LuvKernow","2009-03-25T15:36:58.86Z","Poor design","I bought this at the Lego Store in Bluewater for £27.80. I'd already heard that the wing was one piece, so was fully expecting it. What I wasn't expecting was the poor design of the fuel truck and the assembly on the wing... 

The fuel truck is utter tripe. No other single word in polite company could describe it any better. 

The flying wing - It really is a lazy design I'm afraid to say, which I finished in around 5 minutes. Not a challenging build at all. The wheel assemblies are totally basic, the cockpit is a little bare, with the controls(?) in a very weird position! 

The only saving grace for this set, apart from YET another Indy, are the minifigs.

Avoid if you're not a completist like me.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2009-02-06T17:58:09.09Z","g","The real reason I like this set is because of the mechanic. He has the first fully shirt- less minifig chest, so he's definately a rare figure. The crate in the airplane holds a chest of diamonds, but what I'm confused about is why the set info claims that the plane is carrying the Ark of the Covenant. It's nowhere to be found. The plane has two cockpits:one for piloting, and the other for gunning. It also includes the propellers which mutilate the mechanic in the movie, a nice touch, as well as the gas truck. On the  negative side of things, the Nazi faces are overused because lego is too cheap to diversify the figs. ",FALSE,4,4,3,3,4

When I got home and started building it, the first thing I noticed was the HUGE wingspan. The one-piece wingspan is a little too Megabloks-y for my taste but the sheer size makes up for it. I was immediately drawn in by the tremendous size of the plane and the fact that I LOVE THIS SCENE TO DEATH!! :D (Easy boy, easy.) The gas truck is very neat (Always a fan of the retro Indy cars.), but there are too many of those claw pieces and not enough tools for the mechanic. Speaking of the mechanic (played by the late Pat Roach, who gave us the classic archetype of the hulking brute of an Indy henchman (i.e. Dovchenko)), I love the muscle-bound torso and J.J.J. face with brown moustache.

"cameljockie","2009-07-28T11:18:09.403Z","A great addition to Raiders...","Ever since seeing this advertised I was so eager to get it. The flying wing battle is so iconic and the flying wing design so novel in itself, itd be foolhearty not to buy! 

I was fortunate to get this set in the Argos sale; it was down from £40 to £30 which in my opinion is what the RRP should at in the UK.

The colour scheme for me is the highlight of the set with some rare Dark military green pieces. The cockpit canopy print is fantastic, with a nice 1930s/40s machined feel to it...although the cockpit interior is lacking a bit of detail.

The Figures arent much to jump up and down about. that is apart from the mechanic. The torso print is a little to arnie for my liking but it still does the job. 

The fuel truck is a surprsing feature. I thought they would have put in the watch tower that blows up...anyway, its similar to the design of 7622, albeit a lot more simplified. As a playset however its function is still quite useful for anyone wanting to re-enact the fight scene. 

So once again, heres the set in brief:

Pros:
- Ace colour scheme.
- Movie accurate.
- Interesting Landing gear.
- Awesome display piece.
- The  New German mechanic printing.
- Storage compartment for the Lost Ark.

Cons:
- The wing is in one piece and is limited to what can be attatched to it.
- Many Large, annoying stickers.
- Truck detail/realism is lacking.
- Same old figures.
- Too many large pieces
- Might be too big for some people. 

Overall a worthy purchase, and recommended to any one who likes all things indiana jones or who simply likes beasty looking aircraft!

"lotographia","2009-03-11T05:43:16.873Z","The truck actually dispenses creaming soda.","I didn't bother with any of the recent lego planes, I'm not really interested in the kind of set where you can build an entire cockpit in just one go. So I was a bit surprised by the massive wing structure that makes up the bulk of the flying wing. I was anticipating maybe six parts to make up the whole width.

I guess this way the structure is more stable, but still... it's not what I'd call 'classic' lego.

There are some odd features about these vehicles. Why does the landing gear hang free when the plane is off the ground? You can kind of jam the wheels against the bottom of the wings, but this doesn't hold very well. And why is the drum of the truck not restrained properly? It's not a cement mixer, there's no reason it should spin around. These should have been easy problems to fix but for some reason they didn't bother. The ark of the covenant kind of fits in the plane, but only if you remove the handles.

What I do love about this set is how it compliments my Indiana Jones military vehicle collection. Now I have two trucks, one car, two motorcycles and a plane. And their colour schemes match each other perfectly. I know a tank would be against the 'non-violent' policy of the Lego company, but they've already got all different kinds of guns and armored vehicles and missiles and stuff... I'm sure they could design a tank just for this one exception?

Apart from my complaints about the design flaws, this is a positive set to add to my Indiana Jones collection. The flying wing takes up half my desk alone. And the unique buff male torso can be used to create some nifty minifigures. Maybe Henry Jones Senior has been working out...?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

build: predictable but still fun. 4/5

price: don't be thrown off by the great big box for only $30. the reason the box is so huge is because the wings are one piece and take up lots of space. 4/5

playability: It's fun to act out the movie scene, but you would really be able to do a lot more if their was a second pilot. the wheels fall off a lot when you're taxiing around. 3/5

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane has a front cockpit which opens on a hinge, in it is a seat and some (very little) open space which can't hold or fit anything. Between the front cockpit and the cocpit in the back for a gunner, is a open space for a treasure chest or 2 minifigures&nbsp;and you can put a lid (top, if you prefer) on it. The treasure chest will just fit. Last but not least is the gunner cockpit which is in the back. The cover is a pull off, which aren't bad, but they are not the best, anyways, the person in the seat cannot touch the gun but if you put the top on it looks like they are I guess, it is a really good gun design, I never would have thought of it. The base with all these things may fall off and is not easily fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The green stands with the sticks sticking out are very unstable and fall of easily, quite hard to get back back on, you have to disable the thing. The propellers are nice, same as the ones in&nbsp;the <em>Peril in&nbsp;Peru</em> set. There are alot of stickers on the wings which are hard to put on and&nbsp;make look good.&nbsp;If you pick it up the wheels will dangle and when you put it down the wheels have to be pulled back. You have to pick the plane up by the part of the wings&nbsp;next to the&nbsp;green stands, if you hold it any other way the base will come off or it will fall or something will will break. The&nbsp;tips of the wings on the sides are not that important but necassary. Altogether the plane is easily broken and flimsy but it is still okayish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This set gets a 4 because of the truck. It is great. It has some&nbsp;very unique pieces. Yes there are 2 stickers but they are easy to put on. Two people can fit in the front. Three people can fit above the drivers seat on that platform.&nbsp;One person can fit on each side in front of the gas tank.
