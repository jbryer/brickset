Ever since hearing about this set a couple of months ago I have relished the day when it would show up.  Fortunately for me, Christmas came a little early thanks to TRU stocking the shelves prematurely.  I’ve been stingy with my ratings but I’m going to give this set a 4 (not a 5 due to the higher price/piece ratio and low swoosh factor).

Perhaps this is a little manufactured due to Lego’s stinginess with EP2/CW clones but I’ve wanted a nice stash of EP2-style clones for some time now so this does the trick for me.  Ever since the issues with Lego releasing the SW minifigs 3-packs in 2000 (they were purported to have issues with Hasbro) I’ve wondered if we’d ever get sets that were figure-heavy without having to buy a huge set.  Like past army builders this one delivers well.

First of all, having the three varieties of clonetrooper is great.  There’s a commander setup with visor, pauldron, and kama leg armor and the two pistols.  A clone gunner, looking similar to the clone pilot from the 7674 V-19 Torrent, is included with gray arms and a different model of chest armor.  Two regular clonies round out the squad.  There are three blasters and a couple of viewfinders and headlamps also.  Instead of the dk. blay (dark bluish gray) color of the accessories of the 2008 sets, these are all black.  I actually prefer the black but having different colors helps gives the illusion of there being different squads.

The clone walker is along the same ilk as other vehicles from battle packs:  a nice throw in to give the minifigs ‘something to do,’ yet nothing remarkable.  It’s a two-seater, like the picture depicts, with thigh, knee, and ankle joints for the two legs.  It’s tough to make it look like it’s in walking mode without it tottering over.  The two missiles included are flick style.  I think it’s a nice addition to my ever-growing diorama of CIS vs. Rep. forces on my desktop, diversifying the various battle vehicles.

In keeping with the trend started with the V-19, AT-TE, Clone Tank, and Republic Gunship, this should have been white with dark red markings instead of lt. blay and green trim.  Perhaps it is a junior version of the 7250 Clone Scout Walker, which has the same color scheme.  Because we’re getting a blay color, we also get two republic logo stickers instead of the tamped versions from the V-19.  Having two stickers nags at me.  C’mon Lego, it’s only two.  Why not just give us the stamped parts?

Anywhoo…the nature of this set guarantees that they may be tough to find if you have any army builders in your area.  A big thumbs up.

The Minifigs:

The clones are nothing special, same as always except that the clone gear (2 Antennas, 2 Flashlights, 1 Visor, 1 Kama and 1 Pauldron) are Black. Not Gray like Commander Cody's or Captain Rexs. It's black. The Clone Gunner has a different Helmet with the republic Emblem and A Torso with gray arms.The ""commander"" is actually just a normal clone, except he wears the Kama and Pauldron. The Weapons: 3 Blasters and 2 Pistols.

the Walker. It is realatively small, smaller than the Clone Scout Walker 7250 realased in 2005. There is room for 2 minifigs, and It has the Flick-fire missile funktion on the left and right. The legs are very thin, making it look unstable and un-impressive in your Clone Army. You also have to stick 2 Republic emblems stickers on it.

Pros:
-4 Clones, including the new Gunner
-Arc Trooper Gear

Cons:
-The Walker.

If you are going to buy this set because of the walker, don't. Buy it for the Minifigs. Army Builders, this is your chance. In comparison to the Assassin droids battle pack, Its kind of worse, seeing as it has less minfigs, pieces, and the Speeder looks cooler.

its very well designed, although slightly fragile with loose side paneling which uses those blue technic pins which really dont do the job.

The other issue I have with the walker is the fact there are no controls! How are they suppose to pilot it?!

The new gunner clone is fab, truely FAB! I hope lego keeps this up with the clone wars theme. having said that it would have been nice to have bit more colour on the clones as seen with the 2007 battle pack. 

But being able to upgrade a standard clone into a commander with the new funky body wear really adds to the level of authenticity. 

And so the reason I am only giving this 4/5 is simply due to minor design flaws aswell as the plain coloured clones. Hopefully in the near future lego will rectify this problem and add some colour to the armour!

"Shadow_Crawler","2009-04-03T07:32:09.39Z","Both Elegant and Heavy-Duty at The Same Time","Well, this set is simply... unavoidable, I still don't think it's the right word, but it's the closest I can think of.
You get 2 clone troopers, a clone gunner, and a clone commander, which look like Rex but miss the blue line. Even only the minifigs will be an excellent reason not miss this set. The troopers are standard with helmet , standard torso and medium blaster. ""Rex"" is equipped with some kind of sunray-deflector (which is to see better in Tatooine, I think), a chest shield, a leg shield, and 2 short blaster. Gunner comes with different torso and golden-painted helmet. Another plus point is (I don't know if I was just luckyor every set is same) if you look carefully at the head piece, you'll see that each head is different, there are heads with normal eyes, eyes that looks to the right and eyes that looks to the left.
The walker's legs is very simple & easy to build, the middle part is easy (only a little bit harder than the legs, but still easy). You got 2 flick missiles, 2 1X1 cylinder plate with Republic logo (sticker, grrrr!) 1 cannon, and 2 orange lights (which doesn't light, get what I mean?)
Overall, the point I like the most of LEGO is there's always a reason to buy them, no matter whether you are a newbie or a master.
For newbies, no matter you're new to SW or new to LEGO entirely, this is a incredible set to buy, simple enough yet appears both elegant and heavy-duty at the same time.
For masters, this is great set to expand your army. Plus you get 4 minifigs which surely will make a fine addition to your 501st legion.
Perhaps the only con is that it IS expensive, luckily I got it 40% off from a friend.

First of all, you get two normal clone troopers, a clone gunner, and a clone commander. The troopers are nothing new, they are awesome, though. The gunner is the best, but I will have to buy two more of the battlepack to get enough to fill the gunship. The commander is o.k., but they should of included somepne like Cody, or Rex, or maybe Fox. His accessories are great. You get two antenna's, two range-finders, a skirt, and a shoulder pauldron.  You also get two short guns, and three normal guns. The walker is great, too but I would of liked to see an AT-PT (All terrain personnel transport), but it's o.k. Here are the pros and cons-

"krysto2002","2009-08-24T22:16:48.967Z","An unbiased review","First let me state, I am NOT a Star Wars junkie, and I don't automatically rate everything 5/5. I will give this set a fair review for what it is, no more, no less.

Figures:
It's what the set is all about. It is a battle pack, designed to enhance your ""army"" (for those who actually have an army of clone troopers in their basement) which makes this set useless unless you have something to do with it. If you wonder why I pick apart each detail, it is because the entire set focuses on the minifigures. When this is the case, it is crucial that each figure be as good as it can be.
The set includes a rather diverse supply of four troopers.

Standard - No frills clone trooper, standard everything. The torso is double printed which is nice, but I can't stand the faces (no wonder they all wear helmets). Both also have rifles with scopes, very well designed I might add.

""Gunner"" - This trooper has a different torso design and a detailed helmet, not much else changes.

Commander - Here are the troubles. While the commander is decked out with armor and two pistols, the leggings prevent his legs from bending (major minus), the shoulder guard prevents his arm from raising (another minus) and the overall appearance is way too bulky. Luckily, each piece is removable.
8/10

Walker: 
Another downer. I think for a walker, that this one is disappointing. You are better off converting it into a one man walker and a small outpost/turret on the ground, because two men in a suspended walker is just unbelievable. It is barely balanced. Also, it is barely armed. There are two rockets (only two) and the cannon is tiny. 
-I recommend that the more seasoned builders attempt to scrap the second pilot's seat for some more firepower and some controls. You could even try building a hovercraft or spaceship.
6/10

Value:
For its price ($10-11 in stores or shop-at-home, $12-15 and up online) it is rather fair, but you are better off getting it new in stores or from LEGO.com rather than getting ripped off elsewhere. You get four figures and a 51 piece walker. That translates to about $3.00 for the walker, $1.50 per figure and $1 for all of the accessories, much less than you'll pay online or anywhere else.

Final Breakdown
Pros:
-Four figures
-5 guns
-Detailed
-Comes with lights and antennae for helmets (2 each)
-Lights and antennae are also compatible with older helmets (ex. Dragon knights) and vice-versa.
-Great for parts

Cons:
-Armor impairs movement of figure
-Imbalanced walker
-Terrible flick fire missiles

Overall, I give the set a grand total of 7.5/10.

Building-

        - Difficulty - This set should be very easy to build. No really hard parts. 10/10
        - Instructions - The Instructions have 30 steps, 15 of which are sub-steps. There are 25 pages total including the front and back.10/10

Playability- Alone, this set doesn't really do much. You need some enemies to fight. 7.5

This set is a great army builder if you are in to clone wars stuff like i am. As far as minifigures, you get two clone troopers that are good for filling up bigger sets like the republic gunship or the AT-TE walker. There is also a clone gunner that has different armor than the regular clones, and can be used as a pilot for the walker, which i will discuss later. The last minifigure is an ARC trooper. I personally don't like arc troopers because they have armor that prevents them from sitting down. This set also comes with some extra gear to put on the regular clones, which i just put away.

The secondary part of this set is the clone walker. It is a good size for a battle pack walker and has two flick-fire missiles, which are always good. It also has nice detail and another small cannon on the front. It seats two, and most people put the gunner in front and one clone trooper in that back.

Overall, if you want this set, go buy 10 of them. They are a good value if you think of it as, 10 dollars for 4 minifigs= 2.50 per fig. Pretty good deal already, an d you also get a walker with some cool parts. Definitely a good deal, and i think every lego collector should have at least 3.

The gunner is a very nice touch, too, with a cool helmet, a nice chest, and grey arms. Then we have the two regular clones. Two nice little clone troopers, both of Clone Wars design.

So recent, in fact, that my first purchase was a little over a week and a half ago, which was the Clone Walker Battle Pack. I was in a Toys 'R' Us trying to decide between this one and the Assassin Droid set with the Speeder. At the time, I was debating to even begin collecting LEGO again. I hadn't actually built any sets since I was 12 years old and I'd never built any sets as a true collector before either. It’s been 10 years. I am now 22, about to turn 23; having just played through most of the LEGO STAR WARS: The Complete Saga video game on the XBox 360, I decided to finally dive into the real thing and I'm so glad that I did.

At first I didn't think that there would be much to this one. In Canada, it runs at about $13.99, but once I finished the build, I loved it and I was forever hooked on LEGO STAR WARS. I'm already a huge fan of the STAR WARS franchise to begin with, and I love how accurate these sets are.

The Clone Trooper minifigs are extremely well done and the Walker itself was much sturdier than I initially thought it would be, especially with the legs. I am definitely planning on buying more of these little guys to build my Clone Army's frontline when I have the money. There are still other sets I need to buy first, but I highly recommend the Clone Walker set to any fan of STAR WARS: The Clone Wars.

"Maul","2019-11-22T15:43:33.267Z","The best SW CW Set ever!!","<p>That&#39;s right folks, your eyes didn&#39;t deceive you - this is the best Lego SW Set, especially in the Clone Wars Line (for source check out my opinion :D).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s move on to the reasons why I think this is the best SW set. First of all - it&#39;s a battlepack, therefore it&#39;s quite affordable, it&#39;s easy to find and you can buy multiples of it easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secondly it&#39;s the best army builder in terms of the figures you get - you get 3x standard CW clone troopers and one gunner and they all have a very accurate and neat design. Now I know that one of the troopers is supposed to be a commander but if you don&#39;t add his accessories (which came in black for the first time in this set), he&#39;s just a regular trooper and that&#39;s what every good army needs - more standard troopers and less commanders. If you&#39;re not army building and&nbsp;simply want to own one of these sets for display purposes or whatever then you still get the chance to have a commander or you can simply promote your gunner into a commander by adding the accessories on him. The only other battle packs which could arguably be better than this set in terms of army building are 7668 and 7914 because there you get a whopping 4x of the same standard soldier, however not as many people are as passionate about building rebel scouts and mandalorian armies as there are about building a clone army. So that&#39;s all about the figures - they are all stellar ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next we have the actual set - the clone walker - a very neat build, it has some nice parts, the color scheme is very eye-pleasing, with fine details&nbsp;and an army of these does look pretty good actually. You could also try to build a bigger walker combining the parts from multiple 8014&#39;s + adding some of your own extra parts. Overall not the best battlepack&nbsp;vehicle in my opinion (we have another clone battlepack for this purpose - the BARC speeder from 7913), yet it&#39;s still up there and a mile ahead of some of the other battlepacks&nbsp;(especially the recent ones - those things suck..).&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also got to say that the box design from the CW era is also one of my favourite ones - that combo of white and light blue + the full face image&nbsp;of that clone trooper just does it for me, it really looks great. The playability is also on point - you get the 4 minifigs&nbsp;+ a tons of accessories for them, you get two flick fire missiles and the walker is decently articulated. You can also put two minifigs in the walker itself (doesn&#39;t have space for all of the figs like some other battlepacks but you can still fit two inside and not just one (like some other battlepacks xD)).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a great value for money, a stellar little fun set, I own 5 of these and not regret it even a single bit. As you&#39;ve probably noticed I&#39;m a sucker for the CW Lego SW sets and this one is definitely my favourite (surpise surprise).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Get this set if you still don&#39;t have it in your collection (shame) and if you have it already - get another one :D</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t the first battle pack or the last. It&#39;s probably one of the most popular. The Clone Walker is a perfectly fine vehicle by itself. Four Clones are included with it with the option to make one of them a Clone Commander. You have blasters for all and plenty of other accessories to outfit your troopers with.</p>

<p>Why everyone bought this set, however, was the cheap price. This was back when battle packs were affordable. Having four troopers in one set meant you could assemble a small squad really fast. Putting together an army just required some extra sets.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t really that worth it today, considering all the other battle packs released in the following years and the updates to Clone Trooper designs. For its time, it was the go-to army builder. If you loved Clone Troopers, this was the set for you.</p>
