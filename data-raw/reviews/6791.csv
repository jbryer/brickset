I didn't want this set when I saw it in a store, but when I opened it and built it this morning it was awesome.  It has good droids on an unbeatable speeder.  Now to pros and cons.
Pros.
2new elite (black) assassin droids
3 normal (silver) assassin droids
very beast speeder in sick detail
Great army builder
low price

cons
low playability level w/o clone walker battle pack.

"MandalorianCandidate","2008-12-28T19:32:20.547Z","Who wants an IG-88 army?","The original CW toons had a scene with an IG-88 fleet on speeder bikes wreaking havoc with the clone army.  To counterattack, Obi-Wan donned clone armor and sped away on his bike having a field day with the assassin droids.  I’m a bit closer to recreating that battle on my desktop thanks to this set yet I don’t have individual speeder bikes, just the behemoth that’s included here.  Of all the pack-in vehicles for the battle sets, I like this one a lot but just a bit less than the Battle Droid carrier from 7654.  It’s pretty long and detailed for a smaller set.  The steering vanes are the typical gun port pieces from the X-Wing and Snowspeeder sets, but with dark blue accent pieces—a color tone that I prefer over the lighter plain blue color like from the AT-TE STAP.  Perhaps the most interesting parts are the rear wing pieces, which are unique to this set.  Bricklink.com describes them as “Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Angular Extension and Flexible Light Bluish Gray Tip.”  The tips on these two, which are pretty long, are made of rubbery, bendable plastic.  The only place to secure them is the 1x2 spot at the widest part of the piece, so these were truly made for this set with not a lot of modding being available for them.  Another nice feature is the two handlebars used to secure the two assassin droid riders, since they lack another way of being secured to the vehicle.  There’s a couple of gun posts like with the 7668 rebel ship too for their weapons.  A couple of flick-fire missiles with the rare trans-purple cone round out the bike.  Definitely a nice addition, but I would have taken 2 smaller speeder bikes over this one large one.

Unlike the Clone Walker Battle Pack (8014), the minifigs here aren’t as exciting.  They are basically the IG-88s from the 6209 Slave 1, but two are black ‘elite’ versions.  Nice to have a little variety, sure.  The droids themselves are battle droids with altered heads, clipped to the torso with Magnadroid claws.  These clips don’t allow the heads to fall too far forward or backward, which is notorious for old battle droids.  These minifigs also have one straight arm for the blasters (4) or rifle (1) that are included.  A plus are the two extra sets (one black one metallic gray) of spare arms.

The price per part ratio is pretty average around 10 cents, but there are a lot of tiny pieces.  There are several larger ones for the speeder bike that make up for it.  It has plenty of swooshability, unlike the droid walker, but watch out for the front steering vanes as the tips tend to fall off easily.

Again, some nice stuff here yet it just didn’t do it for me.  Instead of the assassin droids it would have been nice to have some of the SW commando droids that were seen a few weeks ago in the new show.

The speeder is nice, CIS color scheme, and new rubber tail fin parts. I do like that they made the straight arms for the droids at least to hold the blasters correctly.

The new ""metallic"" colored droids are pretty sweet, as are the new black models.  The speeder itself is kind of lame, with room for two droids and two flick-fired missiles on the side.  Nothing special.  For $10, I'm wondering if it is worth it.  Technically you get 5 mini-figs, but I've never really considered a battle droid figure equal to an actual mini-fig.

The bike is quite good and for once the droids have something to hold onto, rather than just getting crammed in the cockpit like usual.

It's also quite nice that you get a few spares, especially the extra silver gun-wielding arm so that my old IG-88 can finally be upgraded - pity you don't get an extra gun to replace his loud-hailer! :-)

a little difficult sometimes to get droids in speeder without removing a side plate
a little hard to stand up (well, their droids)

obviously the pros outweigh the cons, but id recommend the clone battle pack unless youre building a droid army.

theres just one last thing i need to say about this. the instructions for the speeder says to put this stud on the left side of the base plate, but it does absolutely nothing. its places between two bricks and only connects to the baseplate. you cant even see it because of the side armor. someone can stare at it for hours and not figure out what its for.

Anyway, lets get on to the review. The minifigs are decent, but arent spectacular. Im actually very surprised that lego didnt deciede to make a new mold for the heads. Oh well, the classic IG-88 head will do. The speeder is very well done. I really like the color sceme on the spike wing things. Lego also shows off its new transparent purple cone. I also want to add that the speeder is extremely long. I compared it to my Jedi Starfighter and noticed that it is almost as long. The place to put the guns is kind of pointless though. Lego did think ahead and included two sets of extra flexing arms to clip on to the controls firmly. 

Pros:
Huge speeder
Good amount of figures
Decent amount of weapons
The cheapest way to get the new purple cone pieces
For once, the flick missles do fit in well

Cons:
As great as this set is, I really dont think anybody wants endless amounts of assasian droids. In other words, this was a wasted battle pack
Those black Assasin droids really dont pass off as ""elites""
Boring coneheads

Minifigures: 7/10. Well, I think the assassin droid's heads are a kind of smart design, but other than that, they're usual. But I really like the assassin droid with a rifle, he's the sniper in all games I play.


Building: 7/10. Less than the clone walker. The build is very fun, though, and I'd rate it one point below the clone walker.


Pieces: 5/10. Speaking of pieces, there's no new, no anything, just regular pieces and misplaced colors. ;)


Design: 8/10. Like the clone walker, I just love the design, but misplaced colors and random piece entries give it an eight.


Playability: 4/10. Like I said at the beginning, it's VERY hard to destroy assassin droids, let alone ELITES?!


Price: 9/10. SOMEBODY CHANGED THE PRICE AGAIN!!

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-06T21:49:13.597Z","IG-88 is That You?","<p>Set #8015 Assassin Droids Battle Pack: Another Battle Pack from the Star Wars theme gives us a chance to build up an army of Assassin Droids, unique looking droids from the Separatist Army, except they are based on the IG-88 series of Droid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still a worthy addition and a terrific way to get some wonderful pieces to build up your Assassin Droids ranks. The speeder built with this Battle Pack uses some new pieces, the side vanes are made of a softer plastic compared to other LEGO sets so they can bend and not injure a child if accidently brought too close to a face. The coloring of the vehicle makes it stand out among other similar themed vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this set was worth picking up, not only does it come with a unique looking vehicle, but it includes five Assassin Droids, three silver and two black, five assorted blasters for the droids and spare arms in case you wanted to pick up an extra torso and pair of legs from LEGO to build up a sixth and seventh droid. If you've been on the fence with this one because the Battle Droid bodies aren't your particular interest, I still think you should get this one. Pitted against the Clone Walker Battle Pack you get a fun little battle scene between the clones and the assassin droids.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

"pitcovich","2021-01-27T02:32:45.877Z","A great battle pack with cool minifigs","<p>I bought this set off of ebay for 18$ which is a good deal considering this is 2021 and this set came out in 2009. This set is one that I wanted for my clone wars collection and is a nice addition, Now let&#39;s begin.</p>

<p>Minifigs- This set includes 5 minifigs which is unusual because battle pack usually come with 4. It includes 3 silver assassin droids which are exclusive and look very nice, and two black assassin droids which look great as well</p>

<p>Army building- This set is not the bet army builder out there. Assassin droids are very powerful and an army of them would be terrifying. In the clone wars show there is not an army of assassin droids so this set is more of a one-time set.</p>

<p>The build- the build is a nice looking speeder with two seats for assassin droids to sit in. It has two guns on each seat and included flick missiles and has plenty&nbsp;of room for the droids to sit in and overall is a good speeder for a battle pack.</p>

<p>Overall thoughts this set is a good set and I recommend this set for anyone who likes getting cool characters for a cheap price</p>

"Vikn","2021-02-19T10:37:32.167Z","You already know if you want this set","<p>Basically the title says it all. What you see is what you get. I think the poor reviews for the set are entirely based on it&#39;s quality as a battle pack for army building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sure, I can&#39;t imagine many fans are building large Assassin droid armies. I don&#39;t think there was any significant army-sized force of assassin/IG units in the extended lore, legends or otherwise. I could be wrong, I love SW but never read any of the book series as my time spent reading is generally on series&#39; that&#39;re only in book form (plus the consistency&nbsp;is spotty I&#39;d bet...seems like fan service&gt;literary quality)...</p>

<p>Based solely on it&#39;s quality as an army building battle pack, it makes sense that it received such a spotty reception from fans. Personally, I have no real use in building large armies as I don&#39;t play with sets, I only display them. So for&nbsp;me, rating this as a lego set instead of as a battle pack, I am a fan. I&#39;ve always loved the assassin droids primarily based on aesthetic and their representation in universe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First off, I&nbsp;thought the speeder was&nbsp;great! It&#39;s sleek and the color scheme is more grounded than some of the bright, kid focused stuff. Rating this battle pack just based on the vehicle/speeder, this is honestly my favorite. It&#39;s just well put together and far cooler than most. I particularly dislike when Lego gives us comically scaled down versions of established vehicles, so I appreciate when they leave those alone as larger sets and we get something novel. Sure, it&#39;s relatively standard in shape and design, but it seems, to me at least, like one of the better iterations of the standard speeder look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only other aspect to rate are the figures. I love these droids and was totally satisfied with these five fellas. They are flawed, which I will touch on momentarily, but the iconic look of these droids was the primary reason I ordered the set post-retirement and therefore, I am entirely satisfied....they look how they&#39;re portrayed on the box, that&#39;s about all I need for something like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, these droids are a bit flimsy. They lack the variety of poses that we get with normal figs and can have a real hard time standing up unassisted. I tend to lean them against the speeder, but I get why this was a major knock on the set for many, even if it seems trivial to me.</p>

<p>Basically, I am a bit surprised at the reviews solely because I cannot imagine what fans expected beyond what was clearly advertised on the box. If you love the assassin droids, consider picking this set up. Otherwise, probably not worthwhile. They&#39;re not great for armies and the flimsiness can detract from play Id imagine. Neither of those matter to me whatsoever (tbh, I&#39;d rather Lego always sacrifice play features to give us a better&nbsp; value but I realize that&#39;s unreasonable).&nbsp;</p>

<p>So i return to my opening sentiment; you almost certainly know whether you want this set or not.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Black Assassin droids these two droids are made of standard droid parts in black colouration. They both carry standard blasters.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build is pretty straightforward you build a speeder for two of the droids to fly. The speeder fits two droids and there blasters and has two flick missiles.&nbsp;<br />
