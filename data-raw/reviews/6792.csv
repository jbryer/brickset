3 ""heads."" There are 2 on the top (only one moves,) and on the bottom there is a spy head, with one eye.
Working ""bombs.""

The bomb dropping mechanism works well, and is simple, the ship is actually about three times the size of the smaller vulture droids. I think Lego is giving us a break on pricing because this one is about perfect at $20. The little jump jet droids are alright, but they're basically just special colored battle droids with binoculars on their back.

Now to the review-

Construction:

Pros:
Fairly detailed instructions, easy and quick to build.

Cons:
All the markings in this set is a sticker, some of them rather large.
Easy and quick to build.

Play value:

Pros:
Very swooshable, stands up easily.
I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the ""bomb dropping"" play feature, going so far as to bomb my dog.

Cons:
There isn't anything for it to battle.

Minifigs:

Pros:
The minifigs are clearly pictured and are fairly cool with their binocular ""jetpacks"" and they have pieces in rare colours.

Maybe because at the time, I haven't seen this fighter in action from the Clone Wars Series. Several cons are evident throughout the new lego sets so I won't hold them against this set.

Pros:
The new minifigs, Makes the set worth buying
Bombing system is impressive

Applying your own stickers

Minifigs: I really like the jet droids in this set. The idea was from the Clone Wars series on cartoon network. Nothing much more to be said than that.

Build: Pretty easy and quick. Took me about 30 minutes to complete. The only flaw is the legs are hard to position when trying to stand the vulture. And they sometimes all off.

Finished Product: Looks nice but not very sturdy. I do like the bomb dropping function although they are difficult to put back in.

playability: ofcourse the main function is to drop bombs. the rest is also fun, like the droids flying down to infiltrate a republic base. but maybe a clone with a jetpack would be better

price: for 30 euro it's a little to expensive, but still it's a nice set. and you got 3 exclusive droids with it.

Not that I though it looked bad, I just didn't think it looked as good as most of the others. I got this thinking it would probably be okay, but not great. It turned out to be better than I had expected.

Pros:
-Huge.
-Great looking in flight modes.
-Good colors.
-Looks good with other Separatist vehicles.
-Pretty sturdy.
-The rocket droids have cool colors.

Cons:
-The walking mode isn't all that good.
-Lots of stickers, which would leave the model quite plain looking if not applied (I don't mind stickers, but most fans do).

"P13c30fch33s3","2009-07-07T08:35:48.497Z","A useful addition to any CIS (Droid) Army","This set seems like an up-size of the Vulture Droid because it has the same basic shape:
=> Curve disc front
=> Same wing pieces
=> Same basic head design
Anyway, onto the actual review...

Battle Droids + Jetpacks:
These are basically battle droids with 2 extra pieces. Nothing special, but they are (relatively) episode-accurate in terms of colour.

Bombs:
The bombs are rather simple to make and also use a very simple mechanism to drop them. Even so, the bombs drop neatly after the first three tries (that was for me).

Heads:
There are three heads, two of which can move. One is on the bottom of the non-moving one. The two heads that can move do not swivel. Although it is a shame, it would be hard to adapt the heads to swivel, and it would make it more fragile.

Wings:
These are basically like the Vulture Droid wings made bigger. The (very small) section that holds the wings to the main base is slightly weak. The 2*1 1/3 piece on the back sometimes pops off when you try to move the wings. The wings move smoothly from flight/fight position to landing/walker position.

Main Base:
The main disc-shaped section is quite sturdy. It also holds everything else (except the droids) together.

Bomb Mechanism:
The bomb mechanism is just a few technic sticks held forward by a rubber band. This allows the bomb mechanism to keep the bombs in place.

Pros:
Fairly sturdy (Not built for a trip down wooden stairs)
3 Batle Droids (Always a welcome addition)
Stands Properly (Nothing much worse than a failed attempt)
Bomb mechanism works (unlike other unfortunate failures)
Looks (relatively) episode-accurate

Cons:
Nowhere for the droids to go (they would probably get blasted in three minutes or less...)
Bombs sometimes wobble in sockets (although not much of a problem)

Conclusion:
A useful set to get. It will reinforce your droid army and give you 3 unique minifigs.
PS: I have a feeling that other people's Hyena Bombers were less fortunate and had more problems than mine. Please don't kill me if this review proves inaccurate...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-12-29T20:16:50.39Z","Awesome Separatist craft","Alright, we've all seen Vulture Droids before, and this set takes the principals of the Vulture and takes them to a different level. Unfortunately it would be that there's only one feature: four dropping bombs. These are easy to use and fun to drop, though the sole catch can be replacing them into their holders. Despite this, the fighter itself is pretty sturdy like its smaller Vulture counterparts and holds together well and is fun to have for your Republic vehicles to get bombed and for them to shoot this one down. The rocket pack battle droids are also neat to have for air fights if you have the Tank Droid set. Overall, a very nice enemy craft.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

There are definite 'pro's' but some improvement is needed. 
For instance the color scheme of the dark grey brick against the dark blue need some lighter grey bricks (ala the Armored Assault Tank) for a nicer look. 
Also, too many stickers which could be replaced with unique brick parts. 

PRO'S - 4 bombs (which use a simple clever mechanism for dropping-a rubberband attachment when pulled back drops the bombs quite well), Wings that open/close and tilt to a walker vehicle, tilting bridge sections, 3 jet pack Battle Droids. 

Cons.-Too many stickers, color scheme. 

This set usually gets a bad rap, but it's a nice edition to your 'droid' army. Has a nice look in flight mode and when you tilt the wings down and open them adds to the playability.
Also this set can be considered a Battle Pack since both vehicle and mini-figs are all Droids.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I also found it strange that there were no blasters just bombs, so I added my own.

Now the good things, I really like the mechanism that drops the bombs, all you have to do is pull this lever (For lack of a better word) and you drop the bombs. It comes with 4 bombs altogether and you can drop all of them at once or two at a time. I also like how you can move the head and the tracker head thing underneath.

"pitcovich","2021-01-08T18:16:57.077Z","This set is not nearly as bad as people say it is....but could still be better","<p>This set is not a bad set, people say that this is one of the worst lego Star Wars sets of all time. I like this set and it is fun to play with&nbsp;but it could still be better, now let&#39;s get started!</p>

<p>-building experience, this set is not small but it does not have very many pieces. It has some stickers which make the model look good but the build is quick and there is not much to say about it.</p>

<p>-parts, this set includes 3 rocket battle droids which you can only get in this set and the droid tri-fighter (set 8086) and they are very cool with the geonosian head and body and the gray arms and legs. This set has nice dark blue pieces but not much else to say about the parts.</p>

<p>-Playability, This set is pretty fun to play with, the droid head can move up and down but not side to side. The wings can fold and bend to put it into fly mode. You can release the bombs by pulling back a handle on the bottom of the ship, releasing 2 at a time.</p>

<p>-Overall thoughts, this is a good set and was cheap at the time, but despite everyone hating on this set I recommend this set for collectors and kids if you can find it at a good price.</p>
