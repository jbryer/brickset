I suppose this is a re-tooling of an earlier set, though I'm not familiar with it.  However, I do know the earlier version had an overall blue color scheme to it, while this newest version is more accurate to the movie sticking with the menacing black and gray of the Empire.  

Pros:  New Darth Vader fig, with new torso
New lightsaber hilt, no longer the dull gray from more recent sets, but a slightly metallic color, though I still prefer the shiny silver hilts from the original sets
Two missiles that really fire
opening cockpit
place to put Vader's lightsaber
nice little details and scale

Cons:  $30 for 250 pieces?  Should have thrown in at least another fig
Vader's cape makes it difficult to put him in the cockpit
Vader's helmet is very loose on his head

Don't get me wrong its nicely put together and fairly sturdy and size wise next to the x-wing it's pretty good.

But overall it's not worth the price, I understand their are probably licencing costs which bump the cost up but compare it to the city Dozer, set 7685, the Dozer is £10 cheaper and has 100 more parts, it and is a more substantial model.  Further lots of the part son this model are small, there are some large panel pices but overall there small parts out number the large 3 or 4 to 1 and therefore it represents poor value for money at 11p per part compared to half of this for the Dozer model at 5.5p per part.

In this special anniversary lego set you get a tie fighter (darth vader's), a darth vader figure (new version) and a chance to get a chrome darth vader. The build is fun but short. The price is pretty good seeing how there are lots of larger pieces. The fire-flick missles are good because they add play value (for younger fans) and they are hidden for collectors (like myself). The cockpit is done well and the top never snaps off when you open it like other tie fighters. I also like this set because it isn't blue and black it is grey and black. A much more accurate color sceme. The stickers are a bit of a pain but there are very few. Overall, it is a pretty good lego set.

"A_Brickset_user","2009-09-10T23:36:30.217Z","Amazing set! Inexpensive!","The TIE Fighter model is bigger in real life. The wings are enormous. The set also has a Darth Vader minifig with red lightsaber.

I recommend this set to anyone. Plus, the set is only $29.99. No need to go to the Lego Store since this set is available at almost every major retailer like Walmart, Target, or Kmart. I got mine at Walmart.

The model is not perfect, however. There are only 2 Technic stubs that connect each wing to the main body of the ship, making the structure rather flimsy. I added a third Technic stub in each wing to strengthen it, but I also place the ship on a stand, so that it doesn't put any extra stress on the joints.

The cockpit only has a tiny panel with controls. The Darth Vader minifig has a cape, which you may make seating him in the cockpit rather inconvenient. On the plus side, the ship has a holder for the lightsaber.

It's perfectly well designed, and you get a Darth Vader, which is logical. But they could have thrown in an extra minifig or two; and they should have made it so that Darth Vader can sit in his own cockpit without having to remove his cloak. 

The flick-fire missiles, launched by lever, are better than the lame ones where you have to push them out yourself.

"Da_LegoBuilder","2009-09-29T21:01:18.983Z","I have you now...the force is strong with this one","It has been exactly 1 year ago when I wrote my last review! And it is my 5th anniversary of collecting star wars lego! So, the best set to write is review on is Dath Vader's Tie Advanced.

I know some people would read bullet points or some would like to read a paragraph on it. I'll write both. Lets start with a bullet point list:

Pros: 
-A new minifig. The middle body is silver, and shiny
-the new chrome/grey light saber hilt
-A 10th anniversary lego set, which will fetch a lot of money if you sell it on eBay in 5 years.
-At a fair price of $30 for 271 pieces
-Darth Vader's face is very angry with more scar wounds!

-Grey parts on the Tie, instead of the old one (which was blue)
-new flick-fire missles, better than the old ones that fall out
-combine it with the rouge shadow and you get one awesome lego scene!

Cons: 
- Same blueprint as the TIE fighter, only modified
-flick fire missles, only to have black studs on them, what kinda missle is that?
-The top piece of the cockpit always falls off
-required to put on stickers!
-cockpit is jammed with barely any room
-cockpit has no firing triggers, only a small 1x2 rectangle, on the ground! (can't shoot on the ground, can you?)
-you put the light saber on the bottom of the ship, general grievious style!

                This set comes with a new Darth Vader minifig. I'm not sure if the minifigure is in other sets, but this one is different from episodes 3, and the imperial star destroyer. He has a silver body instead of the gray part. He comes with the chrome ligthsaber hilt, and..the red lightsaber blade. I have seen many lego sets that sold 5 years ago, and sold for triple the price on eBay, evidently, this set will sell for at least double the price 3 years after this set is discontinued. For a price of $30, and to get 271 pieces with a minifig, the price is reasonable, keep in mind this is a 10 year anniversary set. Darth Vader's face is different than other darth Vaders. His face is angry with a couple more scar wounds, the minifigure may be the same in the recent Dath Star set. One time I did drop it, and 95% of it survived! Sturdy, so don't worry if you are careless or have younger siblings who do not care about lego. There is flick fire missles that do not fall out! Instruction booklet is easy tto read. I put the rouge shadow and this set displayed together and it looks quite imperial evilish! This one is better than the old one, the old one had blue markings instead of grey, so this one by far makes it look better
               Evidentally, the diesgner didn't put much thought into making this, and I was comparing the instructions with the Tie interceptor, and most of the instructions were the same! like (80%) of it. I may come with flick fire missles, but the way you fire it is by pushing up a button, making it not go very far. Also, the flick-fire missles have black studs on it, doesn't have the grey of black cone on it as seen in the clone battle packs. When I open the cockpit, it falls off! It gets really annoying when you have to constantly put it back together. Also, it requires stickers to put on. I'm not very fond of stickers, if you place it in the wrong spot, its impossbile to take off! The cockpit is very small, barely enough space to place Vader in, but on top of that, there is no controls, which are on the floor. The controls are not even elevated so Vader looks like he is driving his own fighter! The lightsaber is on the bottom of the ship, which looks awful when you look at it from behind. It needs a place to hold it where its not seen.

Overall, this set is very good, despite the poor planning for this set. I recommend to add this one to your lego collection, and possibly buy another one. (I have), mostly because this set WILL go up in value in the next 5 years,and you can sell it for a profit. It is also fun to play with, and a new darth Vader is always welcome! This Darth Vader is better looking than the other actually.

Here is my closing from the review:

Features
Missiles that flick, cockpit that opens. Yep. That's about it. Oh, and owning one of the meanest minifigs of all time. It's a starfighter so not much in the way of moving parts. Considering it's only a single person fighter.

My rating:
Playability: 4/5. It's not office friendly. A bit too big, but perfect for my son to play with. If I let him.  So it is very ""swooshable"" for playing with.
Design: 4/5. Although not a UCS, for a minifig play set, it's fine. Just enough details and not too much where it would be falling off while playing.
Build experience: 2/5. It's rated low because it's very easy to build. No trouble at all. Perfect for new people to put together.
Overall: 3/5. My son would rate this higher as he loves to play with his sets. My rating is based as an AFOL. It's sitting on a shelf. Nice to have. Worth buying if you can get it for $29.99.

Parts of the body are then connected further with some plates but the wings (solar panels) are connected by two pins only, leaving them fairly wobbly. The center part of the wings is just a single layer of plates with a single layer of tiles around the outside. As a result those parts are not flat but bent, curving away from the body. Extra hinges front and back or possibly and extra layer of plates could have prevented this.<br><br>Value for money is never great with licensed sets but these 250 parts 
for €35 are especially bad. Only one minifig, a lot of plates and tiles 
and hardly any interesting parts.<br><br>Vaders helmet seems to sit very loose. So loose in fact that when you place Vader in the cockpit the cape behind him pops the helmet off his head. Playability is limited on this set. The cockpit opens and it's got two flick-missiles and that's it. I think I've found something positive there: the flick-missiles on this model don't interfere with the looks like they do on some other models.<br><br>All in all I really can't recommend this set. It's expensive, wobbly and doesn't look right.<br><br>",TRUE,2,1,1,3,1

This is great fun for anyone who enjoys Star Wars, like me, and you don't even have to be a LEGO Star Wars collector (I'm not) to enjoy it.

<p><b>Parts: </b>Er... There's Darth Vader? And a window? Plus a lightsaber? That's about all (if you call that much) as far as parts go.</p>
<p><b>Playability: </b>This is great for playing. This is only my second LEGO Star Wars set (which is odd seeing as I've been a Star Wars geek since I was 3...) so I can't really have any space battle vignettes, but if I had a Star Wars fleet it'd fit in very well.</p>
<p><b>Value for money: </b>At $29.99 (&pound;31.99), this set's a fair price. I would've liked maybe five dollars tacked off the price, but we're in a recession and it was a gift, so I'm happy.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,4,4

CONS
-Overpriced ( most legos are overpriced though) should have been 20 - 25 dollar instead of $30

I mainly got this set cause it has Darth Vader. The only other current set with Darth Vader is the Death Star which is $400. When I first made it the wings broke and i had to rebuild the wings. Then the whole set broke cause my friend was playing with it. So I rebuilt it again. Now it sits by my xwing which overpowers this sets blandness.

The most famous Sith Lord of all...?""","I celebrated my 23rd birthday this past week and I ended up with Vader's TIE Fighter, Hoth Echo Base, and Anakin's Jedi Starfighter all at once; although Darth's ship is my favorite of the three.

This set is amazing. At first I was worried because it didn't sound like it had many pieces to it; but I was more than happy with the finished build. It looks much more detailed built than on the box.

Not only does this ship have one of the coolest colorings I've seen and is very true to the series; but it also includes a great rare minifig: Darth Vader. The only other set I've ever heard he comes in is the Death Star, which I don't own personally because of the price. I don't have $400 right now, but I do hope to own it later on.

Anyway, the price in Canada is around $45.00 and worth every bit. The build was enjoyable and some pieces are printed, which is nice. There are a couple stickers but not many. The wings are flexible and the completed set looks simply incredible when combined with the rest of your star fleet.

One nice feature is that the flick missiles stay somewhat hidden until you push the mechanism to make them fire out. The cockpit window also opens upwards and can fit Vader easily, although it's easier if you remove his cape first. I'm always worried I'll end up bending or wrinkling the fabric capes on my minifigs.

It was straight forward, the only repetitious part was building the wings, which isn't bad at all. Pretty much the whole set is black and grey. There's also a spot for Vader's light saber.

As soon as you get to the wing struts though you realise this is no ordinary TIE fighter. They are substantial, good looking, and have missiles in! The large rear section is surprisingly good and detailed considering it's based around two large disk parts. And the way these mains sections of the body fit together is really great, locking to place and mostly held by just two 2x2 tiles. The wings are where the lack of blue is most noticeable, and the way the hinges are incorporated for the bend in the wings is a real upgrade on the TIE Interceptor (6206), feeling much more substantial and secure.</p><p>The <b>completed model</b> is great fun. All the modules fit together well and it has that compact 2009-era feel that I really like. The grey tile on the wings look good, and because of it's compactness you don't mind so much that not all the lines are covered - if they were the ship would feel crowded so I think Lego have made just the right call there.</p><p>There are a couple of faults though. The flick fire missiles simply aren't heavy enough to go anywhere and could do with another small round piece on each. Vader's cockpit seems cramped as he won't fit in wearing his cape (and though there's storage for his lightsaber there isn't for the cape), but at the same time feels empty as he's got just the 1x2 tile on the floor pretending to be controls. And the central &nbsp;section of the wings have a tendency to bend outwards towards the back because of their length and lack of bracing. Nothing huge, just a few things to be aware of.</p><p>And of course, <b>Darth Vader </b>is excellent! I think the set did well for just having the one figure as it kept it affordable, and he's the only Vader in an affordable set since the ROTJ mini arrest and throne room scene from the yellow-head era. He's well printed, with a great moulded helmet, and his face is wonderfully grey and scarred.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Darth Vader in an affordable set!</li><li>The TIE is grey! At last!</li><li>Really good compact feel, well represented visually.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>A few little niggles with the finished model - poor missiles, bendy wings, and a sparse cockpit</li><li>Why are the four 2x2 decorated tiles not printed? Pity.</li></ul>
<p>This was a real gem of a set and well worth acquiring if you can find it. I am just a little reticent that it seemed like a reboot for the TIE fighters, and nothing really followed unit 2012 when there was another reboot and the compact feel was lost. 9492 dwarfs this set quite embarrassingly, it's a shame as they're both great models but don't quite work together as a fleet.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
