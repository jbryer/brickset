"thepeopleperson","2008-12-22T15:32:47.67Z","One of the best Clone Wars Sets!","I got this set early at TRU, and overall I am very pleased with it.  It has a nice amount of features, and for once in the Clone Wars line, Lego wasn't stingy with the minifigs, and gave this set 7.

Pros:
New Yoda! He also has gray hair on the back of his head.
New Super Battle Droid arms!
7 minifigs
Flick-fire missiles dont't fall out when not in use
There is a small vehicle in the back that can come out
Very well constructed
Colors are great

Cons:
$51.99 at TRU, should be more like $40-$45.
The battle droid in the top cockpit has to roll into a ball to fit inside
No blasters for the battle droids
Only 407 pieces (took me only 30 minutes to build)

Putting aside the price and a few minor points, this is one of the best sets in the 2009 Clone Wars lineup.  If you're looking for a nice set to spend $50 on, I would reccomend you buy this. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"wyoeaglefan","2008-12-29T10:31:10.687Z","Cool, but expensive","My wife picked this up for me the day after christmas as a late gift and I was really happy about it. I'm glad that they decided to finally re-design the AAT and in the cool CIS blue. The total of 7 mini-figs is nice for a change but even with them I don't feel the tank is quite worth $50, maybe $40. I like the addition of the new grenade launcher arms for the super battle droids, and the new yoda is decent. The tank is a bit smaller than I expected, but it seems to be built well and looks more ominous than the prior release. I would recomend this set to any LSW fan if you can afford it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ngclarkiv","2008-12-22T19:17:13.89Z","AAT Good Set for 2009?","Although I am not a huge Clone Wars fan, when I first caught sight of this set at Toys R Us, I had to buy it.  I saw many other sets of the new 2009 Clone Wars and Indiana Jones LEGOs and since I collect both, I thought it would be a tough choice but not really...  Anyways to the subject, the AAT is a great set!  Much more accurate than the old Episode I tan one that I own when I put them together.  The new AAT is much more sleek, it contains only two places to put battle droids in, they both fit in their compartments great, although the battle droid on top in charge of the huge gun has to be folded up.  The battle droid on bottom has a little hover craft sort of vehicle that he drives and fits right into the back of the AAT so it looks like it's a part of it.

PROS: 
-The AAT is brilliant looking (What more can I say?)
-Two battle droids
-Three Super battle droids (have a nice new arm to them, that looks pretty cool)
-Yoda (Third set with Yoda ever, but a brand new Yoda looking figure that looks obviously like the one from the t.v. series.)
-Another Clone trooper (seeing how scarce they are to find in sets, a new clone is always great)
-Six flick fires missiles, three on each side.

CONS: 
-Stickers (contains seven.  not too bad compared to the Speed Racer sets, but stickers are still a pain no matter how many.)
-Yoda (I'm not a big fan, he's weird looking, although the grey hair which he has on the back of his head that you don't see on the box cover is kind of cool.  I'll stick with my ol school Yoda from the Jedi Duel with Dooku though.
-No Binocs on top.  (Just thought that that specific droid should need one like the old one had.)
-Hover craft that the battle droid has (if it is a hover craft) was kind of stupid and pointless.

Other than that it was a good set.  Not great but good.  Yet still good for your collection if you don't have the old one.

"yodaccm","2009-01-11T19:11:11.623Z","Separatist's Heavy Hitter","When we first saw these heavily armored tanks rumble over the hills of Naboo, we knew that the droid armies of the Trade Federation meant business.  This new version is more along the lines of the Separatist version, with blue highlights instead of the earthy tan color of the Nemoidian version.  It's a great set with many different features that really make it worth the rather steep $50 price tag.  

The AAT features a huge central cannon that can rotate 180 degrees left to right, though perhaps it should have been able to spin the whole 360.  It has two laser cannons on either side, although they act as flick fire missiles, which is ok.  Nice to always have that option on your vehicles.  There is a cockpit for a single droid pilot to ball himself up in, and a opening hatch on the front, though what purpose it serves, I'm not sure, other than to look inside the tank.  It also boasts a cheap little sled that can dock inside the tank, entering from an opening in the rear of the tank.  There are some stickers here, but they add some nice details.  Along with the tank comes 2 battle droids, 3 super battle droids with new blaster cannon or missile launcher arm, a clone trooper and a new Yoda.

The new Yoda is worth mentioning in detail as this will probably be a big selling point for this set as it is the only one with him in it at this time.  This Yoda is the version from the new Clone Wars series that most of the new Star Wars sets are based on.  I'm not so sure I really like these versions of minifigs with their pronounced features and huge eyes.  However, this Yoda, as compared to say the Obi Wan or Anakin figs, is pretty good.  Unlike the previous versions of Yoda, this one actually has a tuft of white hair on the back of his head.  It's a nice detail. 

Pros:  New Yoda
Good build and great details and features on the AAT
A good number of minifigs
A good match against Republic Fighter Tank
New Super battle droids are nice

Cons:  Wish it had the same wheels the Republic Fighter Tank has
The little sled is a bit lame

"Legonater","2009-06-30T14:46:08.217Z","LOOK OUT!","This set is one of the best medium sized starwars sets I've ever bought. Thr nre SBDs are fantastic, Yoda, even better, and the AAT... words cannot describe it.

First of all: The Minifigs. I'm VERY please to get this set, as my last Yoda's new nickname is Lefty (Implying that, yes, he's missing an arm) and does NOT make a great warrior. The SBDs, are brilliant. They're very fitting with the new series were they can be seen using their huge blaster cannon (Malevolance series, Ambush...) and are very handy. As for the Battle droids and clones, I've seen enough of them, although my GAR needs building. I myself was suprised to see TWO battle droids, a welcome addition.

The tank is... awesome. It's loaded with features such as an escape speeder, and several things to do with the cannon. One downer is that the side lazers are actually flick-fre, possible the WORST spot for them. The cannon can turn 90 degrees. To those who are dissapointed, this can easily be changed by removing the 1*2 pieces with one stud on the sides of the base unit. (Important, take off the cannon first) ANother interesting fact is that the cannon goes up and down. I don't remember seeing this in the movies, but wither way lifting it make the cannon look bare and weak. There are two hatches, one on the cannon, the other lower down, leading to the speeder. The side lazers can be moved 360, another intresting note not shown on the box. 

The speeder is an interesting though useless addition. It can generally be used as a control station, but if you lower the back it'll zoom out and go... somewhere. To tell the truth it would be more usefull attatached and having a ramp instead but, why not. Plus it can be used as a troop transport (Or SBD taxi...)

result: 5/4 1/2. The flickfires and speeder bring it down a notch, but not to bad. Very good set. I'm just happy I got this instead of the attack shuttle (: ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2009-03-06T00:24:31.483Z","expected more..","i had bean waiting for this set for so long, and when it came out i couldnt wait to buy it.. and when i got it it was a bit of a letdown. the things that botherd me was it was blue, where as the vehicle i rember and liked was always beige. also theres not much playability and things to do with it, so i find myself playing with it without much enthusiasm. but there are some great things about it too. the minifigures of corse. we get 5 droids, a clone and yoda *wub* who is 10 times batter than our old colourless headed friend.  the tank is well designed. it has a small speader for the droids, which folds up into the back of the tank. now in my opinion its utterly pointless, as it has no wepons or anything to do at all. i turned to speader into a longer droid carier, and added a cocpit into the speaders storage spot. the turret can turn 45 degrees to either side befor its stopped, and the barrel can go strait up, but not down, which is a flaw. the set has lots of details on the sides, with grates pipes and stripes. 


minifigures- 5/5 i think just 1 droid a clone and yoda would have been completely acceptable for this set, but they made this set alot better by adding some extra droids

design- 3.5/5 lots of detail, sturdy and lots of room, with flick fires on the sides. one thing i dont like is the mixing of dark blue with the light blue, bleh.

playablity- 3 not much to do, i mean you can aim the gun and take out the speeder, but kinda pointless.

"skipp","2009-04-02T14:15:33.967Z","Armoured Assault Tank","Well, this definitely is a great set. The colours, and the whole build up is just amazing. I've been waiting a while for a new AAT seeing as I didn't get the first one, and I'm so glad I got this one cause it's just great.

 The overall Tank is quite large, it has a big cannon on the top, which sadly doesn't rotate 360 degrees. The hatch can only be closed if the gunner ducks his head down. Then the set also includes a small speeder, it's a bit pointless, it's basically just the inside of the AAT. And of course, flick-fire missiles. Although I wouldn't suggest firing them, the tank does look odd without them. 

The minifig-wise you get 2 normal Battledroids, and three sweet new SBDs, with a rocket launcher arm. He's not much different from the others, but still pretty cool. And then there's a clone trooper (nothing special) and Yoda. Yoda's sweet, so much more detailed than the original (dead-eyed), and I just love the gray hair!. The new lightsabers are also pretty sweet. The silver looks so much better than its two ancestors.

Overall a great set.

"Leggodt94","2009-07-15T11:29:07.013Z","""Open Fire!"" - Battle Droid Commander","The first time I ever saw a lego AAT was back in 2000, and I absolutely loved it. Now, I am overjoyed to see that LEGO has finally come out with one of my most anticipated remakes, the Trade Federation Armored Assault Tank(AAT). This set has lots of great features like rotatating laser cannons on the side and the little speeder that comes out of the cockpit. The main peering laser cannon on top can rotate side to side and up and down along with an opening cockpit. The main driver's cockpit can be opened from the top and the main side mounted cannons have flick-fire missiles. I think that the characters for this are an absolute score. I love the new supers with their cannon arms. Plus the set comes with two battle droids to pilot the vehicle of course. I like that this set came with a clone trooper, but yoda doesn't look the greatest which is not an issue with LEGO of course it's the new mentally impaired staff at Lucasfilm. And also, the color is an issue, again not LEGO's fault, but I think that tan was a perfectly good choice of color. I think that Nute Gunray should have showed some concern to Count Dooku before he let him change the color to an ugly blue. The only thing scarier than a blue AAT is a blue MTT, which LEGO may get suckered into doing in the future. Anyways, apologies for the ranting, I still believe that in an of itself this is a great set. It's a classic set that I'm sure most missed back in 2000, so I'll give this set a 5/5.

"I_like_Lego","2009-07-18T09:09:55.623Z","The dark side is strong with this set","I got this set yesterday and if you wonder why i gave this review this name is because i didn't get a CHROME DARTH VADER (read my first try at trying to get one here http://www.brickset.com/reviews/PostedBy/?User=I+like+Lego just scroll down till you find it)and i was angry :( but i went on building and my dad put on the Stickers again.

PROS :)
.Yoda,his eyes look kind like some paint came off.
.Super Battle Droid Commander,i was afraid to put on the arms because i might brake them,and the rocket arms feel kind of weak.
.Clone trooper,now have an army of fourteen of em (including Rex and Cody).
.Tank,nice blue color,nice cannon,nice room for speeder thing,nice top turret,and nice how it goes across the floor smoothly.   
.Chrome Lightsaber,My very first chrome lightsaber,and it's nice and shiny.
.Rifle,these are hard to find in clone wars sets.
.Battle droids,don't have too much of these.
.The speeder is a nice addition,and PRINTED PIECE.
.Flick fire missiles,these fire pretty good then other flick missiles.

CONS :(
The door thing on top of the turret of the tank (the one which the droid who is sticking his head out) dose not come completely up,and the book makes a mistake because the light Grey hinge piece is not attached to the dark grey hinge.
.Sometimes the end of the turret comes off. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

A fairly easy build but it comes with some neat stuff... 
PRO's - Overall look and design, a small hidden patrol car that holds one of the Battle Droids which comes out the back of tank(and can be seen from a hatch below the top hatch), 4 long flick fire missiles, top hatch can close neatly with Battle Droid inside, movable turret, cannon raises and lowers, side missile battery raises and lowers and 7 minifigures(2 Battle Droids, 3 Super Battle Droids, One Clone Tropper and the best of which is a real nice Yoda figure). Yoda's head is actually made of a soft plastic/rubber. Nicely scuplted. 

Would recommend this model. Fun to play with and it moves very well on smooth surfaces with several shallow domed shaped pieces below the vehicle to simulate a slight hover effect.
 
CON's- Long flick fire missiles to the left and right fall off from time to time. Wish it had a tighter fit or set deeper into the side arms of the tank. Two front stickers to simulate a metal plate could've been subsituted with a Lego brick plate to look a little better. When you put the stickers there, make sure they line up with each other to have a nice symetrical look. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SkyBrick","2010-01-18T16:07:01.763Z","Cool set, no flick-fire's would be better though.","This is a very cool set! It is fun to build, detailed, and is great for play. The set comes with three Super Battle Droids with rocket launcher arms, two Battle Droids, Yoda, and a Clone Trooper. The Super Battle Droids' rocket launcher arms are great, they make for the heavy section of Super Battle Droids. Yoda looks pretty good, and has the new kind of lightsaber hilt.

Pros--
-Great play set.
-Well detailed.
-Includes a good selection of minifigures.
-Cool rocket launcher arms for Super Battle Droids.
-Good value for money.

Cons-
-Flick-fire missiles form the side guns instead of your normal parts.
-Has several stickers. I liked it better when you had the markings already imprinted on the pieces, it saves the hassle of getting the stickers on exactly right.

The new arms on the super battle droid minifigs
The rotation on the main cannon
The droid carrier
The detail
The flick fire missiles

"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-18T07:52:29.327Z","Yoda fights the giant AAT...alone, without a clone trooper...OH! There's one...","This set is the BEST for those of you who really like sturdy LEGO Star Wars sets. Another reason why this is a really good set is because of the minifigures included (YODA!), as well as droid to battle.

There is a small little top for the droid to work the turrent (Which spins), and a speeder in the back (Modified to be a door to the inside). Pros and Cons coming up next:

Pros:
1. Big, blue colorscheme is beautiful!
2. So many droids, excellent for the battle (Remember, one Jedi equals 100 droids)
3. New super battle droid arms are way more realistic
4. Pretend there is an explosion, pop the gunner's top off, then put it back on easily
5. Great playability!
And more...

Cons:
1. Though this really isn't that bad, a few random peoples pop off.
2. In my opinion, this set is a little too large compared to minifigure-scale,  but still really good (Better bigger than smaller)

Parents: Your child will love this set (Especially the pieces at the bottom that make it look as if it is floating), though they may need a little help depending on their experience in LEGO building. If you can, try helping them out with this one (Or any).

I recommend this set to anyone who can find it, especially those saving for something good, because this is it! Another good thing to get with this would be the Clone Walker battle pack, then the droids and clones would be evened out.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Yoda. This is a new version of of him, only found in this set so far, but I think they're releasing one with the new, not yet released republic cruiser (not the old red one).
