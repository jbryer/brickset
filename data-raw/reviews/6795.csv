As far as the ship, it's constructed fairly well as far as the main cargo/troop area, the wings are surprisingly sturdy relative to how many pieces make them up. My only complaint about the construction is the attachment of the cockpit, it falls off very easily and should have been re-inforced better. I'm also impressed at the missile launcher, honestly didn't expect it to work so well.

The mini-figs are good, I hope that Mace Windu only comes with this set, to make him a little rare, but you get another clone and the second set to have one of the ne pilots.

"jesse73","2009-01-09T14:38:21.14Z","Awesome way to continue the saga","So far this has to be my favourite set of 2009.

For starters its great fun to build and LEGO outdoes itself with rapid firing missiles, 8 on the top and drop bombs that drop and reload, two on each side.

The cockpit and general layout is true to the Star Wars theme and like most fans i cant wait to get my fingers on the rest of this years sets.

The only negative thing that i have found is actually the size, my seven year old has problems handling its size and keeping the wings on...but slight attention makes this a very playable set.

The minifigures are always fun and LEGO has spent more time in 2008 and 2009 to replicate the Clone Wars theme into their faces making it all come to life.

"sudorum","2009-01-16T16:21:25.217Z","Imperial Landing Craft 2","Though this set does have a small minifigure number, the rarity of these figures makes up for its flaw. Provided is a new Mace Windu minifig (purple lightsaber included) and a clone pilot. I actually found the set to be significantly better than I had originally expected, and I almost didn't buy it. The Republic Attack Shuttle is basically a better and improved Imperial Landing Craft. The wings can fold up; however, this is manually done and without the use of a gear system. The interior of the shuttle has a chair, a rack for guns and lightsabers, which is basically the same as the ILC. It also has a nice bomb dropping function which is much more efficient than the ILC version. And the semi-automatic flick-fires are actually useful and work extremely well. ",FALSE,5,3,4,5,5

Pros:
-Fairly reasonable price.
-The rapid fire flick-fire missiles are awesome! Normally I hate f-f missiles but these are just so fun.
-Includes an awesome new Mace Windu minifig (with rare purple lightsaber blade and cool new dull chrome handle) whose head actually isn't all that bad. I don't have the one from the turbo tank, but this one looks much better.
-Also includes a plain white clone and a rare clone pilot.
-The bomb dropping mechanism works fairly well.
-No stickers (I don't care but some do).
Cons: 
-The rapid fire f-f missiles don't look very good and require a troublesome gap in the floor to operate properly.
-Maybe it's because of my mods, but sometimes the bomb dropping mechanism breaks.

Best 2 features:

a) semi-automatic missile launcher on top - clever design and works very well, possibly one of the best lego weapons ever.

b) bombs - very nicely done, 4 bombs can be dropped individually from 2 bomber bays below, my favourite bomber yet :)

Also, the rotating wings are a nice touch, as is the double-opening cockpit. The little compartment in the body (with Mace Windu & lightsaber, plus 2 blasters) is nice for playset value, too.

"yodaccm","2009-01-02T03:44:06.247Z","Gives the Republic Gunship a Run for its Money","Talk about a formidable addition to the Republic's already heavy arsenal of war machines.  

Equipped with four laser cannons, semi-automatic missile launcher, and a payload of 4 proton bombs, this shuttle is a beast.  It has a nice cockpit able to seat the two Clone troopers that come with it and a rear compartment to seat the accompanying Jedi General Windu.  Similar in construction to the Imperial Landing Shuttle, the wings fold up to land and down to take off.  Overall, it is a sturdy construction with a nice color scheme.  

There are a few cons.  The overall look comes across a bit blocky, and despite my usual aversion to stickers, this model could actually benefit from a few.  The rear compartment is rather tight and only able to really seat just one figure, which seems odd for a shuttle meant to transport troops.  The missile launcher actually works pretty well after getting used to it, but sometimes it gets jammed.

This is a solid set with some great features, a great Mace Windu fig (with new metallic colored lightsaber hilt), and two clone figs.  It's a nice compliment to the existing Republic sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Now, I know you're wondering where does the quote at the top play into clone wars. Well, what most people don't realize is that the shuttle you see flying around during the end of revenge of the sith is an imperialized version of this attack shuttle not the imperial landing creaft. Anyways, This set has probably got to include the most flick-fire missiles I've ever seen in a set. What I love though is how LEGO designed it to synchrinize the effect of rapid fire bullet rounds going through a sing gun which is cool. I also love the way they designed the missiles on the side so that the second one loads automatically. Other features include landing mode foldable wings, opening top, piece in the back that holds the troop's and/or passenger's weapons, and a double open cockpit. Plus the minifigs for this set are great. I'm so glad that this set came with mace windu instead of movie-accuerate ahsoka because let's face it, mace windu is just plain cooler.

"donneyboy","2009-03-21T09:14:28.983Z","biggest of 2009 sets","I got this set last night from a local Wal-Mart, and I got the last one they had. It is an awesome set, and the biggest of the 2009 sets so far. You get three minifigures, they are a Clone Trooper, Clone Pilot, and Mace Windu. Mace Windu is the new clone wars version, and only appear in this set. He also has the new pearl silver Lightsaber hilt. The Clones just have blasters. Now to the features. For featues you have 2, dropping bombs, and firing missiles. You get 4 ""Popsicle stick"" bombs, why are they Popsicle stick bombs, because their colors are blue, green, and yellow. Now the missiles are semi automatic, so you push a button, and it fires them, and you get 8. It is a really fun feature, and a lot better than flicking hem by finger. Also this set has a lot of dark red in it, so if you want ore dark red, this set is for you.

Mace Windu
Clone Pilot
Clone Trooper

"captain_radda_radda","2009-08-16T01:20:13.747Z","The ""Big One"" of Wave 2","If you havent noticed, this is the biggest(and most pricey) of Clone Wars Wave 2. I guess thats okay seeing as Wave one had 3 big ones(I bought them and reviewed them all. My wallet is still recovering. LOL) Unfortunately, it seems lego slacked off a bit. The set is way too small. In ""realtity"", the shuttle is about the same size as the gunship. It can hold a small amout of troops (about five-six) and has room for two pilots. Unfortunately, the set only holds about three standard figures in the main compartment. The cockpit does hold two clones though. Four blasters fit in the weapons area. The ship is heavily armed and can easily take down an AAT. The bombs are a bit too colorful for me. The repeating launcher works excelently. I'm glad a clone tropper was included, but it couldnt have hurt to spring for two. Mace Windu rocks and looks like he means business! 

Pros: 
Very detailed and extremely color accurate
Great figs 
No sticker, but it really isnt a big deal
A fair price considering the amount of pieces and the size

Cons:
Very disproportionate. I would have gladly forked out $90 for a big shuttle that fits a lot of troops and lets a figure walk out through the front. 
Not enough clones 

Overall:
Despite its size, this set is great and is the main attratction to Wave 2. 
Although the set is smaller than it should be, lego made the right deciesion buy keeping everything evenly sized and big enough to battle the other seperatist vehicles without completly dwarfing them. Get it because in the long run, its better than most of the Wave 2 sets and is the best priced Clone Wars set so far. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Phoenixfighter","2009-08-29T23:55:52.123Z","8019 Republic Attack Shuttle","This set, as well as being a Shuttle, works really well as a bomber. It doesn't fit many clone troopers in the troop bay, there is really room for only one. I got this set for my 13th birthday and it still blows me away since then.

The front of the cockpit folds out forward to reveal 2 seats for pilots, There is a red piece at the rear end of the cockpit that folds back to be able to seat the furthest seat, this is very cool. The two cannons on the sides of the cockpit rotate 360 degrees which give the ship a nice look.

There are very little minifigures in this set which is quite a disappointment, because in the Clone Wars series this Shuttle can fit heaps of troops. I think this set needs more clones and a bigger troop bay. The troop bay is another disappointment, there is only room for one troop inside the whole bay, but you can probably take out a few things to make more room. In the Clone Wars series this Shuttle is about as big as the Republic Attack Gunship.

My personal favorite about this set is the bombs that fall out the bottom. Inside the troop bay there are two long sections that contain 2 bombs in each, at the back of the Shuttle there are 2 small switches that release the bombs from their chamber. This is a great way to reduce the amount of enemy tanks.

The flick missiles at the top aren't actually flick missiles, there is a round piece behind the missiles which when pushed flings the missiles out of a hole. This makes these missiles 'push' missiles.

The minifigures you get in this set are one clone pilot, one clone trooper and a new Mace Windu, these figures are all very cool but there is very little of them (like I said in paragraph 3). There should be at least 4 clone troopers and possibly 2 clone pilots. Mace Windu is a really cool addition to this set, it is a shame he doesn't have a cape and that his face looks really random.

I must admit, this set is awesome. Apart from the diminutive amount of minifigures and the small troop bay this set is fantastic. So if you are struggling to decide wether to buy this set or not, you definitely should.

First of all its one of the better value lego sets, massive piece count yet still less than £50, (only by a penny admittedly). Secondly you get Mace windu, thats Samual L Jackson in lego, surely thats worth £50 alone. 

The build is interesting and a couple of evenings worth, the overall effect is stunning especially when it all starts to come together. The mechanism for taking the top of the storage bay is a lovely touch and very sturdy. The misslie firing part actually works really well and the cockpit sits two comfortably.

The wings fold up when landed, the cargo area features lift up sides to reload the bombs and Mace Windu has his own chair. With a push and carefull positioning you can fit another clone trooper in the back if you allow Mace to hold his own light saber and sit him with his back against the pistol holder.

This is the only slight down with this set, when you open the top you'll think you have loads of room for extra troopers but due to height restrictions they have to be in the middle and sat down.

Oustanding set, brilliant build an easy five stars.

The building process was fairly easy. While not a piece of cake, it did not provide many challenges and was quite straightforward. Overall, it took me about 45 minutes to build. However, the build was quite enjoyable, helping to build the tension in the wait for the finished product.
When I was done, I was impressed by the design of the ship. It looked very nice and sleek. It also has great features. I had tremendous fun firing the missiles and dropping the bombs. Both were very easy to do. To fire missiles, you simply push a button attached to an axle that shoots them out of a small opening. To drop the bombs, simply turn a lever to open the bomb bay doors.
The playability of this set is enormous. There are so many things you can do with it! Fire the missiles, drop the bombs, deploy Mace Windu and the one clone, and of course fly the ship around!
Overall, this set is fantastic, and I can`t recommend it enough.

This set is also my first set which I got with jedi master Windu.<br><br>The republic attack shuttle has lot's of play features like sviwel turrets, flick-missiles which you can shoot if you push a button on the back and a sviwel cockpit where you can put in two minifigs. You can also lift up the fins on each side and the top on the back if you want to see the inside. There's nothing much in the inside but you can see a place where you store the blasters of the clones and the lightsaber of Mace Windu. There's also a chair for the third minifig. On each side you can see two bombs which you can drop if you sviwel the lever in the bottom. I don't have anything to complain about this set and this set also doesn't come with stickers which is very good if you don't like stickers.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great model and I would highly recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

My favorite part is the missile function. Behind the ship, there is a button. When you press it, missiles come out the front of the ship. When you've used all eight missiles, the holder for the missiles falls out the bottom of the ship. Then you pick it up, put missiles in it, then shoot again!Pros:Two big cannons Two small cannons on the cockpitBombsMissilesMACE WINDU!clone pilotclone troopervery cool missile functioncons:None",FALSE,5,4,5,5,4
"Mandalorian","2012-01-28T12:01:47.14Z","Incredibly functional","I ordered this set online a couple of days ago and built it a few hours ago. Here are the pros and cons, since that's what everybody reads.<br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>It's big. With wings in flying mode, it measures about half a meter wide, 25 cm long and 15 cm high.<br></li><li>The interior is very detailed. I know how many billions of people complain about it and say it totally sucks, but I like it a lot. Lots of small details.</li><li>Good minifigures. The clone pilot and Windu was new for me. The pilot has nice yellow markings and red republic emblems on his helmet, Windu has a nice purple lightsaber.</li><li>Missiles shoot fairly far and are rapid-fire, due to a rubber band and some Technic.</li><li>Bomb mechanism is ingenious. They fall out one at a time and are reloaded thru the top.</li><li>The building experience is a lot of fun. It took me 2 hours and 10 minutes to build the whole set.</li><li>If you're a MOCist, the parts are wonderful. Lots of plates, wings, technic beams and missles.</li><li>Looks rather good, like it should.</li><li>The way the cockpit opens up looks really cool for some reason. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>It's heavy. Much heavier than you expect.</li><li>Fat and stubby when landed. But it still looks like the real thing.</li><li>Missile magazine falls out when ship is upside-down.</li><li>Landing gear looks good on the ground, but not so much in the air.<br></li><li><br></li></ul><p>If you have the money, buy this. The pros definately outwheigh the cons, but finding it at a reasonable price may be a challenge now.<br></p>

<h4>The set</h4>
<p>The Shuttle has lots of detail including yellow marks on the wings. The guns are mostly next to the cockpit. I customized the interior of the Shuttle. What I did was I took out the flick-fire missiles and&nbsp;put a&nbsp;6&nbsp;x 2 brick in the interior hole in the center of the hold.&nbsp; It can now fit 14 minifigures (including the pilots).</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions </h4>
<p>I like that all the Lego boxes have pictures on the back. The instructions&nbsp;are kind of weird because it has Christophsis on the front page and Mace Windu was never in a shuttle on the planet, Christophsis.</p>
<h4>Minifigures;</h4>
<p>Mace Windu (it would be nice if he had an extra blade because how many purple blades do you have?),Clone pilot, Clone Trooper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This model is pretty cool. It stays together and the wings are nicely shaped.&nbsp;It comes with&nbsp;buildt in landing gear.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>please rate :)</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

"Brickdroid","2012-11-15T07:04:18.003Z","It looks nice, but it breaks easily.","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>When I was younger, the Republic Attack Shuttle was THE set that I wanted. &nbsp;Mace Windu was my favorite Jedi, and I loved the missile system on the ship. &nbsp;Not to mention, the shuttle itself looks REALLY cool. &nbsp;So, as you could imagine, I was THRILLED when I got this set for my birthday. &nbsp;A little while later, I was disappointed. &nbsp;While the overall set came out looking okay, it was very hard to play with, and that was exactly what I wanted the set for. &nbsp;It was extremely bulky, and when it broke, it BROKE. &nbsp;If you could hold it together, it was fine, but that was extremely hard to do, and I ended up having the cockpit completely detach from the body and both wings fall off. When I tried to get them back on, it ended up breaking the shuttle all over again. &nbsp;It was a set that was too large for the build quality, and while the techniques used to hold it all together would have worked for a smaller, 200 piece set, it was inadequate for this 636 piece monster of a starship. It was also extremely overpriced, and the only good things that I got from the set were the minifigures and the missile system, which didn't break and still works extremely well. &nbsp;I hope that this helped -- Brickdroid",FALSE,2,4,2,2,3
"JW_2187","2018-05-28T14:58:04.05Z","Nu-class Republic Attack Shuttle","<p>The republic attack shuttle was released in 2009 and was immediately a popular release. The set only cost &pound;50 new which was great value for the 636 pieces. The cockpit fits 2 figures in seats 1 behind the other and an opening canopy which splits in 2 sections. This works well and covers the figures how the pilots looked in the Clone Wars TV Show. The hinge construction is a simple but efficient technique which perfectly approximates the slight angle of the wing and perfect positioning of colour and the laser cannons. The cab however does become loose and often falls off as the set&#39;s pieces deteriorate due to pressure (at least the version I got was which I bought second hand in 2016).</p>

<p>The wings have a simple plate construction is parts efficient and is attached simply to the side of the main fuselage. Inside the ship,&nbsp;figures can only be put within the centre, where there is just 1 singular seat which is advertised to be used by&nbsp;Mace Windu. There is also a weapons rack to hold the clone troopers&#39; blasters and Mace&#39;s lightsabre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rest of the interior is used by the main function of the shuttle as it has the missile bay and bomb bay. The missile&nbsp;launcher extends out of the roof as it is a free technic beam which has a space for the missiles&nbsp;(There are 8 in total) which can be seen protruding from the top. The&nbsp;bombs are a surprisingly bright colour as they are&nbsp;lime green with yellow and trans-dark blue. The dropping system is&nbsp;cleverly integrated into&nbsp;the bottom of the ship and works perfectly providing a clever play-feature.</p>

<p>The figures aren&#39;t anything particularly special and there are 3 in total; Mace Windu and 2 standard phase II clone troopers. The Mace Windu is&nbsp;a standard figure, for the clone wars era with the figures copying the animation style, as are the clone troopers which are also available in numerous other sets.</p>
