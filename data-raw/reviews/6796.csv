This set was released this season, and it is a part of the ""Agori"" subtheme. Like all the other Agori sets, Atakus shows resemblances with the Matoran of Karda nui (the small Bionicle sets of 2008) in terms of building. I personally prefer the color schemes of the Agori more than the color scheme of the Matoran from Karda nui. With Atakus, it isn't different.

The package is the same of the '08 Matoran in shape, and it can be opened in both sides, up or down. It is not resistant as the canisters of the medium-sized Bionicle sets (like the Glatorian), but it is good to guard pieces.

Atakus includes 13 pieces, a small number, what makes it a bit worthless. But he is anyways, cool (though much simple) to build and includes useful pieces for the determinated theme. His legs are the same of Berix, and also are his arms. They are, indeed, short in comparison with the legs and arms of other Bionicle figures, but have a nice design. 

The head included has the same shape of the Glatorians' heads, very similar to the '08 matorans' heads, but aren't the same. The helmet is fixed on its top, not on its front, like in the head of the Matoran of Karda nui. The color of his head is a transluscent orange.

His weapons are also included with the set 8978 (Skrall), 8990 (Fero and Skirmix) and with the 8991 (Tuma), but shows a different color scheme, the Atakus' swords have parts that glow in the dark (see in the picture of the product), a nice feature that adds more value to the set, as it has only 13 pieces. His helmet looks like the helmets of Fero (included in the set 8990. Fero has the same helmet of the 8978 -Skrall), but aren't the same, this has some differences in the details. Anyways, it is well designed, and fits well with any Bionicle that uses the Glatorians' heads.

Atakus, like the majority of the Bionicle sets from 2009, includes hands with ""fingers"" (fingers that don't move). It helps the design, but not the usability in other cases.

The playability is good, but of course, it is not so complex like the playability of bigger Bionicle sets. The head, legs and arms moves very well, but the arms are so short (and encurved) at the point to be limited in this term.

As Atakus was recently released with the other Agori in the Lego S@H, and in other toy stores like Toys R' Us, you can find it by 6,99 US dollars, that I consider a good price.

Overall, it is a nice set for a Bionicle fan, and has its pros, but is not the Agori that most worth the money, due to its pieces. Anyways, it is a small addition that can helps the Bionicle collectors.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"DXD","2009-04-01T13:33:06.123Z","| - [ Great Swords, Strange Head ] - |","I just bought this little Agori set about three days ago and I am very impressed with it as it is my favorite Agori out of the six.  This rock tribe inhabitant has the unmistakable Av-Matoran torso and limbs which I simply can't get enough of, and the glow-in-the-dark Skrall swords are the icing on the cake(although I find that they are slightly too big for Atakus's body as they are the same size as Skrall's red-lined sword{s}).  The fact that his mask shaped into an inch-and-a-half long stick in the back of his head surprised me some, but the frontal facial features that this mask holds made up for it(I also find that this strange mis-shapen feature allows for slight ventriliquism purposes if you look at it a certain way   :p)

 [ Pros ] :

-great weapons

-great mask

-great build for it's size


 [ Cons ] :

-weapons are a bit too big

-mask is too long in the back


Thus, I give Atakus a leveled 3/5 review score.

Keep it up, LEGO!   ;) ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Iro","2009-08-07T00:20:42.92Z","Basic Impulse Set, Not Much To Be Expected","After nine snaps, and the plugging in of the helmet and weapons, you're done with this set's build. I'm not going to comment on it because by now most people should expect this kind of build from BIONICLE Impulse sets. These sets are, for me at least, aesthetics.

Atakus is my least favorite Agori for multiple reasons. Firstly, his color scheme is rather bland, unlike his Agori counterparts. Secondly, nothing about this set stands out and says, ""Buy me!"" Berix has his colors, Tarduk has his ape-like aura, Metus has his shield, and Zesk has its semi-custom build. What does Atakus have? A little glow in the dark? Not enough for me, at least.

Pros:
-Cool helmet
-Cool weapons

Cons:
-Unlike other Agori, he has a small amount of new or recolored parts
-Color scheme is bland
-Nothing really special or striking about the set

Overall Rating:
5/10

"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-01T16:12:12.593Z","Them swords GLOW","They glow in full sunlight even!  These things are good glowers!  Anyway, Atakus is a good set, with new pieces including the famous swords and head.  The swords are really neat, as they glow quite brightly even when in full light.  The mask does look like it's carved out of stone, with symbols cut into it.  If you put him up to your window, the red light from his head comes through the symbols, making him look really neat.

Pros:

-Glowing swords!

-Mask

-Head

-Hands!

Cons:

-None

"Carl","2009-10-23T01:11:05.933Z","A pleasant surprise","When I bought Atakus I wasn't expecting to much. But after I built him I realised just how cool this guy  was.

Pros:
Cool glow in the dark Skrall blades
Mask looks evil
Limbs are cool despite only being 1 piece

Cons:
A little expensive for the amount of pieces

Other than the price this is a really good Bionicle.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-27T19:59:28.653Z","Beware the evil Atakus!","This set is better than I thought it would be. The Skrall blades are very sensitive to low light, and glow. The other pieces, except the head and helmet, are not very interesting. The helmet has fangs and like Skrall, is very long.The head is the same as almost all 2009 sets, except I like this type. I enjoy posing him and make him look like he is parring his blades.

pros:
Blades.
Cool helmet. (Fanged)
Fun to pose.
Blades easily glow.

cons:
simple design.

A cool agori. I recommend him to any Bionicle fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
