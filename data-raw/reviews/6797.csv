"bionicle101","2009-01-11T11:44:23.827Z","Small, spendy, but still good.","This is definitely one of the better Agori that we've seen.

Pros:
Small.
Easy to build.
Old pieces (Such as the Vakama Hordika flame sword).
New fists (Very useful for MOCing).
Neat flame design on mask.
Yellow Toa Nuva feet (You never know when they might come in handy).
Clever shield (Those pieces are good for almost anything).

Cons:
Overpriced.
Not enough detail.
They could have made the torso red and yellow to match the rest of the body.
No Thornax.

I would reccomend this to any Bionicle fan.

I am bionicle101 and I approve of this review.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2009-01-13T09:30:49.45Z","Leader of Vulcanus","Like some other sets I reviewed recently, this is an Agori set, released recently with the Glatorian theme. This can't team up with a glatorian (but can with a toa Nuva, though it wouldn't result in a very good combination), and despite what the S@H info says, in the storyline, Malum is no more an ally of Raanu. But the story isn't so important for the sets, so both Glatorian and Agori can be used in the new Bionicle action game.

The building of the set is very easy, and this don't have so much innovations. Just the head and the hands (that are innovations of this theme and the Glatorian), and of course, the mask (it just fits in the new head, by connecting it above the head, like as a helmet). The colors of the set are nice, like the most common red, that makes a very great scheme with yellow. The body is gray (a color that was very common in 2008).

The building consists just in connect the complete limbs (With hands/feet) and head in the body, and then put the additions (helmet and the weapons) by axle connections. The shield is made of two red twin cutters (Matoro Mahri's weapon), and his weapon is the same of Vakama Hordika (good to see old weapons now being used in new sets). 

Not much innovative, but good to it's size and for the quantity of pieces. As an action figure, the most important in the set is the playability. It's good, and again, couldn't be better for a set in this size with this quantity of pieces. I could very well rate it bad, but as in a honest comparison with sets like this, it is very good.

Though the price per piece is high, I would not complain it, have many places where this set is two or three times more expensive, so I will not rate by it. So the final rate is a four. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:
cool helmet
Nice hands
everything else

cons:
should have new versions of the swords and shields ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bionicleboynat","2009-01-20T21:36:22.34Z","pretty good for a matorian","this is a pretty good set i got it for $16.99nz a toyworld

iron man face 
cons 
 to many old pieces like valkama hordias fire sword
overall goood set
by the way this is my first 2009 set i have nothing to compare",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Ponewtu","2009-07-23T14:01:10.717Z","Nice little set, for a while.","First off this is a nice set I think the shield should be different
and only 1 piece the helmet looks great and is fun to mess around with but after a while it gets boring 


10/10 for a little set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-12-29T20:22:47.983Z","""Mata Nui meet Raanu. He's the leader of this village."" - Metus, The Legned Reborn","Raanu is very cool.

This is the list of the agori, 1 being best and 6 being really really bad.

1. Metus
2. Tarduk
3. Raanu
4. Berix
5. Zesk
6. Atakus

So, Raanu is up there at number 3. Now onto pros and cons:

Pros:

Grey torso - it would look really bad if it was a different colour
Classic red shield
Hordika Vakama sword
SUPER mask
Yellow and dark red

Cons:

Head cannot move much becasue of restricting helmet parts and short neck.

Other than that tiny con, Raanu is a must have, provided you get Tarduk and Metus first.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-09-12T14:03:24.967Z","Leader of Vulcanus","Raanu is the wise leader of Vulcanus. His shield is better than Berix's and Metus'. He has a fire sword that he holds in his right hand. His village's Glatorian is Ackar, as Malum was exiled for crimes in the arenas. Vulcanus has it's own arena that is used regularly. 

His hands and feet are yellow, with a tiny bit of orange mixed in. His mask has yellow, dark red, orange, and bright red mixed together. His shield is bright red. His torso has the normal shoulder hight and is dark gray. The handle of his sword is dark red and the flame is Bionicle flame orange. 
His arms and legs are dark red. His face is see-through orange.

Buy him, he and Berix share the place of best Agori villager.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-11-18T20:52:27.077Z","Change of heart","   I take that back about my last review. I realized that they made the Agori to go with their corresponding Glatorian. This used to bother me a lot, but now it doesn't bother me as much. I've noticed each Agori 'says' one of their corresponding Glatorian/Legend due to the colors. Here is the list. If an Agori is missing, that means I can't tell.

- Raanu-Malum (and somewhat Ackar because of the shield)
- Berix-Kiina (roughly)
- Tarduk-Vastus
- Metus-Strakk

Zesk does not count because Mata Nui does has some black but ZERO TAN and Mata Nui is not in the sand tribe. Now I am grateful that Raanu's torso is gray because he would look sooooo weird with a keetorange torso. The shield may look a little out of place, but for those who can't stand it, just take it off, or put it on Ackar. 

pros:
Classic red shield
Fire blade
Very firey helmet
Fun to pose

cons:
Shield is a little out of place

I have had a big heart change about him. I might get another one of him to get more of these interesting pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
