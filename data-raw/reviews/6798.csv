I just got him on the day listed. His mask is cool! He has a new face and mask. He is all green other than his face.

"Dragon_fire","2009-02-22T12:43:50.497Z","Awesome!","This is my second favourite out of the Agori I have. His helmet is my favourite though. The image on the box is deceptive, the spines ate the back are way longer than they look. His arms and claws are cool, I managed to hang mine on a table! His legs do limit posabilty but not my much.

If you are looking for an agori, this is an excellent one",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Legoman1993","2009-03-21T12:41:46.187Z","Great Green Set!","This is a great Agori set to have! If you noticed the colour of the container its same colour as Tanma's! The colour scheme of this set is very stunning (to me) he's an  awesome jungle lime colour mixed with dark green! I think the mask is really cool!! , although no one can see the true design of the mask on the package!!  The spikes are really long ,that makes the mask Even better!! The spikes on his head are longer than Gresh's! It should be on top 3 for the best agori/matron mask designs!  The daggers on this shoulders are neat  The claws are good pieces as well. He is not that hard to pose with these claws because of the fact that he is not the type of agori that stands up!  You might have a hard time standing up Vican (8952) since he has the same claws on his feet! The arm piece that TLC used was a good idea!  It makes him look like a predator...Overall I great set to buy! If you have Gresh, even better the playablity! Buying it alone  is not too bad! either!   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kibble123456789","2009-08-17T19:12:41.763Z","cool green Tarduk!","Tarduk reminds me of tardy but he didn't become my favorite Agori the late!  He never really appealed to me but he was $2 off so why not!  Of course a simple build didn't even need to look at the instructions.  What surprised me the most was how long and huge his helmet is it's bigger then any 2009 set i have.  Here are the pros and cons and exclusive pieces.

"Bob_Clear","2013-12-11T22:21:28.91Z","Somewhat unimpressive...but decent set","Well this little guy seems angry...<br>Tarduk is a small set and has very few pieces...but as with the 2008 and 2009 matoran size sets, the pieces are quite large - the set is more like an action figure than an actual buildable toy.<br>As for parts, we get a new angry looking mask, and several ""old"" pieces -- all in green. The torso is not supported by anything else: no armor, no chestplate, etc.<br>I think Lego was trying to go with a ""Gresh's Little Brother"" feel rather than create a standalone character when they designed Tarduk; this makes him seem small and incomplete without his big brother around. <br>For the price I found it a decent set. I can't say it's bad...but it's not really too impressive on its own.<br>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,4
