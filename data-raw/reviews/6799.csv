"exo_force_fan200","2009-01-25T11:56:11.92Z","Should, but doesn't bring back old memories.","  First, an explanation for the title.  When I said ""Should, but doesn't bring back old memories"", I meant that it has a 2001 piece(the sword), so it should bring back old memories, except that I didn't like Bionicle until 2006.  You may think that the feet are also from 2001, but the tops of these are square, and the tops of the old ones are round.  Second, the actual review.  Berix is constructed of an Av-Matoran body, with 2 Av-Matoran legs attached, with 2 Av-Matoran feet attached to them.  2 Av-Matoran arms are also attached to the body, with 2 Av-Matoran hands attached to them.  The left hand holds 2 gold chronicler's staves and the right one holds a blue Tahu's flame sword; from the back of the sword is a silver cord connecting to the back of the body.  The last thing attached to the body is a translucent-green Glatorian head, with a blue helmet attached on top of it.  Even though the helmet and sword are blue, they appear to be on fire and flaming.  Overall, this set is very good despite its size.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kongunui","2009-02-22T07:18:06.92Z","Nice set, just two little cons","Well, Berix is agood addition to Tarix and has a nice sword but his big prob is that he did not have a good mask! It reveals his very weird face (I hate it) and he has not many pieces! These matoran are getting bigger yet losing pieces! But overall a good set. Give it as a gift or collect it if you want them all!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-01T16:06:41.623Z","You gotta wonder how he got that shield, though...","I just got Berix at the Lego store in Downtown Disney along with Atakus and Skrall.  I built him in the car on the way home, and I must say that he's a 5/5.  He is everything I thought he'd be, and he's playable too.

Pros:

-Blue Tahu sword

-Gold shield (how did he get his hands on that I wonder...)

-Mahri tube

Cons:

-None

Overall: 5/5.  Take my advice and get him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-02-22T13:13:48.39Z","How awesome is he!?","I just got Berix on the day listed, and I got Tarduk last Monday. If you've seen the Glatorian comic you saw him running from the Bone Hunter Fero and his Rock Steed Skirmix. I like to act that part out even though I don't have Fero and Skirmix. I think it's great that they brought back the flame sword. Berix is the Best Agori, in my opinion. Berix has a double air-twister golden shield, a helmet, a flame sword, and the new Bionicle Glatorian hands. His water-flame sword is power by a tube connected to his back that he uses to make his being a water Agori power up his cool flame sword. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Carl","2009-12-02T03:47:46.513Z","Somehow I don't think that he 'collected' those sweet tools","I don't care if Berix says that he is a collector not a thief, but he does look a bit dodgy to me.

Pros:

Three blues
Sweet shield
Toa Mata Tahu's flame sword
Nice helmet(same as Ackars

Cons:

Small piece count compared to price

Berix is really good and like Ackar I greatly underestimated him. GO GET HIM NOW!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"james3426","2009-10-18T18:39:30.75Z","""I'm not a thief! I'm a collector!""","Berix is my favorite Agori. He is also my favorite Agori from the movie. I've come to like him the best because, he was in the first 2009 comic. On to the review.

The build is the simple Av-Matoran build, but I'm one of the few that doesn't care. The water sword he carries is the first light blue Fire Sword. Since I didn't get a chance to get Photok, these are my only, non-damaged chronicle's staffs currently (The one from Iruni is damaged). The recolored Av-Matoran torso looks good. Last, the helmet is a nice blend of blue and lighter blue.

Pros:
Water Sword.
gold chronicler's staffs.
Cool colors.
Blended Helmet.

Cons:
None

A great Agori to have. I recommend this to any Bionicle fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
