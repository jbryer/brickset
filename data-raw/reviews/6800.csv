The hands are a little weird, but they are a nice addition to the bionicle theme. They are also cheaper than last years, so it was a great purchase!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-12-25T12:42:09.903Z","I TAKE IT BACK","I said before that I hated the hands,  THEY'RE GREAT! !! !! !! !!  They aren't as chunky and big as I thought!  And the shield isn't bad either!  I just got him today (Christmas 2008) as a stocking stuffer.  I built him right away, and I love him (Joe loves to play with him more than I do!).

Pros:

-Hands (they're actually my PROS now!)

-Shield

-Sword

-New head

-Colors

Cons:

-14 pieces (little con...)

"Republic_Commando_Sev","2009-01-19T15:59:02.623Z","The Best Agori!","I bought Metus for my friend for Christmas, but I built it.


The Box: The Box shows Metus in a pose up front, with his sword raised, ready to fight. On the back, I believe it shows Strakk, his Glatorian.

The Build: When you dump it out, you get 14 pieces, two of which make up the sheild, (which I'll get to later.) The mask is very very cool, one of the best this year so far. Once again, it takes about 20 seconds or less to build. Not very fun, because it's so fast, but it's good.

The Finished Product: Metus is the best Agori. Period. His sheild, is AWESOME! The blend of white and blue makes it look great, and the snowflake look is awesome, and fitting. It is so awesome. His sword is cool, and really fits him. It's pretty long. His mask is great, like I said above. The blue piece that his mask goes onto, is so cool. It looks like Iron Man! 

I love the Blue and White Color, it really fits an Agori of Ice. 
Really, theres no complaints about him, that's why he's rated a 5. 
If you get an Agori, get Metus, he's really great.

Metus is an Agori of the ice element. According to the Bionicle storyline, he is an inhabitant of the Iconox village, located in the desert of Bara Magna. Like all the other Agori sets, Metus costs 6,99 US dollars (and Â£4.89 in UK), and includes few pieces.

He includes and uses in the building, exactly 14 pieces, like the majority of the Matorans from 2008. With only 14 pieces, this set is very easy to build, and is built in the same form of the Matoran from 2008 and Agori.

His legs and arms are encurved and very short, what makes the playability a bit limited. He has new pieces, like the two pieces that makes the ""ice shield"" (it has the shape of a snow flake), the helmet and head. His head is similar to the head used in the Matoran from 2008, but is not the same. Anyways, his head isn't exclusive, it is included with all the Bionicle sets from 2009 already released. Also, like the majority of the Bionicle sets from 2009, Metus has the ""new hands"" (Bionicle hands with fingers that don't moves). It is a good point in the design, but not so good in terms of use, because this piece is limited to be used just as a hand

The design of this set is very well detailed, and shows a nice color scheme. The light blue and white colors makes it similar to the Strakk's color scheme (Strakk is the set 8982). 

The playability is basic, it is after built, an action figure, with no much articulations like bigger Bionicle sets have, so it's basic. But it is fun to play with, being the playability the most good point of the set alongside with the design.

As this set was released this season, you can find it by the Lego S@H, or in other toy stores like Toys R' Us, for example. The price is a bit high, because it has 14 pieces, but it worth very much for Bionicle fans.

Overall, it is just like the other Agori and Matoran of 2008 in terms of playability and building, being the new pieces and the color scheme the most notable differences. A four out of five. Not so good, but not bad.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jet94","2009-02-08T14:03:23.077Z","Best Agori?","This is an awesome Agori, if nothing else buy it for the shield. I mean this must be the best shield out of all the Agori. It's just a shame the sword is nothing special.

Pros
Mask
Shield
Goes well with Strakk

Cons
Sword could be better but with such a good shield it dosen't bother me
Legs can be fiddly

"captain_radda_radda","2009-02-11T22:13:24.56Z","I think star wars has a new rival","In all my lego collecting, I have always stayed true to star wars. I havent bought a bionicle in 2 years(although I recieved one as a gift). I was already impressed with the glatorian, but I wasnt ready to buy one just yet. Instead, I bought two agori. Metus is awesome. His shield is a never-before-seen wonder. The head looks like a blue transparent c-3po. His mask is pretty cool. 

Pros:
SHIELD
head
face
easy build

Cons:
Boring sword

Overall: I used to love bionicle, but gave up on it. Now, I think Im ready to give it one more chance. If you are in doubt, try glatorian/agori out.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2010-09-29T05:14:36.01Z","Cool guy","I really like Metus! He is one of my favourite Agori. Maybe my second favourite (I absolutely adore Tarduk). His hemet is AWESOME and his shield is AWESOME and although his weapon is old it still looks pretty cool on him. As for the playability, what I find really irritating about the Agori is that you cant really play that well with them because of the joined joints. Overall, however, a very cool set.<div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,3,3,4
"DXD","2009-04-04T20:35:32.31Z","| - [ Half-Masks and Shields ] - |","When I first spotted this certain set in late December, I must say, the snowflake shield really won over my better judgment, and this ultimately became one of my favourite Agori in terms of originality and trueness to their native element.  The fact that Metus was one of the few along with Berix to dawn the half-mask helmet instead of the regular full-face masks that we are all used to.  But after some tinkering around with this set and role-playing with it's head and neck, I've found that these helmets may be just as good if not better than the original masks that we are all used to.


Pros:

-half-mask/helmet

-regular Av-matoran articulation and build

-snowflake shield


Cons:

-lack of joints in the knees and elbows

-ice axe is a bit too bland and simple(although it appears much larger than it actually is when held by an Agori such as Metus.

"james3426","2009-10-20T20:55:21.403Z","The Traitor","This is now my second favorite Agori. I take that back about Zesk being my second favorite. The helmet is very icicle-like, which is cool. The snowflake shield is one of the pieces I got this for because, it's plain awesome! The blend of light blue and silver is great! He's fun to pose and fight with Zesk. He can fit in the Thornatus, but isn't supported with much.

Pros:
cool icicle helmet.
Awesome shield!
Fun to pose.
Sword looks good on him.

Cons:
Simple design.

In all, a great Agori. I think he's almost even better than Berix!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"NickBrick","2010-11-16T17:49:50.323Z","He looked better in the movie.","I mostly got Metus because He was great in the movie. I was pretty dissapointed. He is short and and his arms are way over his head. He posabilaty is just horrible. The ice shield was not near as good as it looked on the box. But it is some what cool. The only good things I could come up with was the helmet and box. He makes a good civillian/Agori. But an awful fighter. no wonder he never fought in the movie.<br>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,3
