Different of the previous Matoran of light/shadows, the Agori can't team up with bigger sets. But it isn't a reason to don't get them, some are allies of the Glatorian, and also who aren't, they are villagers of the same villages of the Glatorian, and can be ""help"" them in battles. In other words, amplify the playability as other action figure.

The building of the set is easy (this have just 16 pieces, but is great for such quantity of pieces), if you want sets that are harder to build, so look for titans and vehicles. The head is one of the new pieces, it is the same of the Glatorian and Agori. The helmet/mask is very well designed for such character, but it isn't compatible to old types of head. The  legs are the same, tan limbs and black paws. One of the differences in this set is it's tail. It is made by a vahki leg (what never was common in small sets) and an old style hand with a small blade in it. This structure connects to the body by the same piece that can connects the light/shadow matoran to the toa nuva. 

The playability of this set is very good for a small set. In this size and with this number of pieces it couldn't be better. However, the size of the most recent villagers (Karda Nui matoran and Agori) is very big in comparison of the firsts, in some cases being the same size of an original toa. 
In a honest comparison with the Karda Nui matoran, this could be a five (At the least it is more colorful and have better types of pieces, like the vahki leg), but it's final rate will be a four. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

When i did get him i thought that when i go on brickset he'd have the best rating of all the agori. I mean, whats not to love?! He's got a cool scorpian like tail and he looks primitive like vorox. He's also unique, he's different from all the other agori. If you met him in a dark alley you'd be scared!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Dragon_fire","2009-02-22T12:48:18.543Z","BEST AGORI OF THE LOT!","This has to be my favourite Agori. he's just generally awesome. the helment the fact that he has four legs and the tail. I like the colour scheme as well. I also like the fact the he is a unique agori, all the others are two legged and live in proper tribes, and most of the others have sheilds.

If there is a flaw, (which in my opinion there isn't, but I thought I'd mentioni it anyway) it is the fact that the tail doesn't have much reach, other than that, no other flaws",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Urgthetroll","2009-04-06T21:35:15Z","Zesk is hungry!","Zesk is a great set.  First of all, it is basically the Rahi of Bara Magna.  Their four clawed legs can cut an oppressor down to size.  Then, it stabs its opponent until it dies!

More leg pieces than any other Agori set
Mask, it has mandibles, four eyes, things on the side (which are NOT ears)
Huge stinger 
Four two pronged Piraka claws (released in 2008)
We haven't seen tan as a main color yet!
Stinger has very short range, so the opponent has to be in front of it

After the fight, Zesk bring it back to their cave.  All tear the meat off and eat it, but leave some. Then a Vorox comes in and consumes the rest.

None shall challenge Zesk, lords of the desert!     ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"james3426","2009-10-17T16:13:53.717Z","""No talk, leave me.""","This is my second favorite Agori.  The only very interesting piece here is the helmet, which somewhat resembles Vorox's. The tail, like Vorox has a Solek Power Sword as the end. This is one of the few Av-Matoran/Agori that you cannot build with your eyes closed, due to the Technic piece on his back that connects the torso to the Vahki leg that the tail is attached to. Last, the poseability is good except for the head, which is being blocked by the Vahki leg.

                                                      Pros:
                                            More complex build.
                                             Awesome helmet.
                                             Poseability is good.
                                            Tail looks good on him.

                                                       Cons:
                                          Head cannot move much.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-10-23T01:16:28.967Z","Munch munch - the last noise Tuma hears before his death","Zesk is a really nice addition to my Bionicle collection. I bought him along with Atakus and I really like them both. This guy is really cool because he is the only Agori, Glatorian or Glatorian Legend that has 4 feet. His tail is really good with the use of a Vahki leg on Zesk's back as the holder. 

Pros:
4 feet
Cool mask(4 eyes!)
Tail with stinger
Vahki leg

Cons:
Overpriced

Something that I find quite weird about this set is that Zesk's stinger spike is the same piece as Vorox's. Um?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"davy_jones","2012-02-29T04:29:42.137Z","Call Ripley!","<p>I do not follow the Bionicle series however, this is the only character that I own from the entire Bionicle series. Being a fan of the 'Alien' movie quadrilogy, I bought it only because of its wild extraterrestrial look and it makes a perfect tabletop display.</p>
<p>The good:<br/>1.) Bipedal or quadripedal stance. This is perhaps what I love most about Zesk, it can be a mean humanoid with a reptilian tail or a four-legged beast with a mean stinging tail; all depending on how imaginative you are.</p>
<p>2.) Very solid build and design. It is able to stand steady in almost all conceivable poses.</p>
<p>3.) Good color scheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bad:<br/>Only a minor one, the legs could have one more articulation point each at the knees if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conclusion:<br/>I highly recommend it even to non-Bionicle fans like myself since it is a well executed piece.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
