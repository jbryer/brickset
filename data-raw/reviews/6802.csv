                   First off, the hands are magnificent and I hope to see more of them in the future. I might've had them be black, though, but that wouldn't go well with the pattern. The head is fantastic, and you could say it looks a bit like Iron Man. The mask is cool and ominous, but it's a tad bit too long and limits the head movement, but not that much. The spinning shield is quite interesting. It's pretty good for blocking attacks but it doesn't spin that well. It's still rather nifty in a jam, though. The dial is alright, but it kinda' looks weird on his foot. Not much of a problem, though. The sword? Awesome. Thornax launcher? Fires well and far. Shoulder blades? They can get in the way some times, but quite creative.
        Overall, this is a great figure and I highly recommend it.

"Arkahn","2009-01-30T20:24:59.95Z","Skrall, good or evil?","Well, first things first, new parts:
 head = things to note, there are input points at the top of the head, and where the ""ears"" would be. so, no old masks what-so-ever.

 the design on the shield looks well thought out, and the swords are neat. over all, all the new parts in Skrall (minus his armor) have the same sorta design. 

the hands are really neat. adds some dimension to a character holding weapons.

the counter is interesting, but i personally don't like it being on his ankle.

as for the thornax launcher, it fires about just as good as the zamor launcher surprisingly and isn't at all hindered by the thorns on it.

overall, I would say a good set for collectors and moc'ers alike.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-01T16:18:59.14Z","#2 best Glatorian in my book","You read it.  Gresh comes in first, but Skrall takes second with flying colors.  Skrall is a very interesting Glatorian, with a black and red color scheme.  His Thornax launcher is built into his large sword, and his saw shield spins freely on a yellow friction pin.  He is very posable, even though he can't look up, which doesn't really matter.  Overall I think he's a Bionicle who's worth getting.

Pros:

-Big sword

-Thornax and launcher

-Swords on shoulders

-Bionicle Action Figure game

-Playability

Cons:

-Can't look up

"Carl","2009-10-25T00:31:17.577Z","""Concede and I will let you live""","When I bought this set, I have to admit, I had my doubts. Particularly about his shoulder pads being the Skrall blades. But once I had built him, all I could say was ""WOW!"".

The torso of Skrall is unique. Its sort of like Strakks, except with the top bit flipped. The Skrall shield is great, with the red parts jutting out from the rockish black parts.  The weapon is quite cool, having the Thornax and Skrall blade in the same thing. It also has a hook piece attached to the bottom of Skrall's hand, which adds a nice touch to the weapon. The mask I really like. Its the same sort of texture as the black parts of the Skrall shield and is long at the back. Although the head is a little hard to pose, I don't mind because its just so cool!

To my surprise, the Skrall blades actually look really cool as shoulder pads on Skrall. And they don't get in the way of arm posability like I thought they would. Hooray!

Pros:
Mask
Weapon
Skrall Shield
Vorox Shoulder pad as chest-plate
Good height
Unique torso
Feet fit in with the character

Cons:
Mask length can get in the way of head posing
Life counter on foot

Other than those minor cons, SKrall is truly a force to be reckoned with!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legoman1993","2009-05-12T00:07:10.593Z","Wow CREATIVE bioinicle set!","Wow lego did a good job on this bio set! I think this should one of the top three glatorian sets! to buy. How can anyone not like the sheild and the sword designs! He also has a cool colour scheme to him, red and black.The mask has a different design from other bios.His mask is long in height. Skrall and Vorox have a new limb design! on their legs as well {nice change for once!}
I don't know why but I think his feet much perfectly with him.  Here are some thoughts on this awesome set!    

  

The sword: I was interested in the sword a lot when i bought him. I like how the sword is put together making his weapon have more range. The detail on the weapon is great. The red circle parts and how the red lines are in a rectangle shape.The blade is also positioned differently than other swords that have been made.The blades as shoulders hmmmm.. Im not sure if I like that??    

Shelid:WOW of the best sheild designs ever! The red maze like symbol has never been thought of before.[great idea lego] Yet it can be used as a attack weapon! , a razor blade sheild! If you have the hand and arm postioned right the range of movement is great ...not so limited   

Some cons: Im not too much into hunch back bioinicles but this will pass.Maybe they could have changed it a bit. That also goes with the body, it could have been a little wider other wise.  

Awesome set to Buy! Every bionicle fan should own this set even though the price is a tad bit high. One of best sets to play with including Malum.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2009-02-18T13:48:59.03Z","Most dangerous of all!","Skrall is one of the best Glatorian sets, and one of the best Bionicle regular-sized action figure for the whole year. Actually, Skrall is not the same specie as the Glatorian, they are another specie of warriors in Bara Magna. They are from the rock tribe and lives in Roxtus. Their leader is Tuma (one of the 2009 titan sets), and Atakus is allied with them. 

Like all the other Glatorian sets, this set have some innovations about pieces. Like the new hand molds (that are not so useful like the others as a piece, but are very useful as a hand and also is compatible with most of weapons), the head (that can't move well like the others and is completely translucent, but at least have a good design), the Thornax launcher and it's ammo (that are one of the best weapons for regular-sized sets, less heavy than the Midak skyblaster and that can shots better than Nynrah), the blades, armors, shield, and as usually, the mask (helmet). 

And also one of the most useful pieces, a small liftarm with a hole for pin and another for axle with a ball joint. It makes better the use of Glatorian/Agori and Karda Nui Matoran heads for the sets. And also is useful to many uses in Bionicle sets.

The building is also innovative. It since 2006 was like the same building (except with some of the barraki), and in a way it still the same thing, but Skrall and Strakk as example, have another positions for the torso. A building more complex than this would need more pieces (and a true Bionicle fan should know why they don't make more complex buildings), but it still a bit innovative. The same piece that could connect a Makuta to a Shadow Matoran is the same placed at the main torso pieces, what gives a place to a small armor at it. The head (connected with that new useful piece) is placed well in the body, though he can't moves his head to left/right very well.

The arms and legs are like the same, but with different armors. In the arms, he have great swords that are awesome in design and don't frustrates the playability, and in the legs, a new type of armor (same included with Vorox), what can be useful in many MOCs (it is in black, a common color). The weapons are awesome, the mix of the Thornax Launcher with the sword (and one of Matoro Mahri's weapon, also in black color) in his right hand is awesome in design in playability, and includes an old type hand to support the launcher. The shield (that have the symbol of Roxtus) is amazing, and being placed by a hole for pins, it can have many uses, not just in Technic related sets.

Like all of the other Glatorian sets (and as well with the titans and vehicles from 2009 and the upcoming legends sets) this have a life counter. The game is kind of boring, but a good fact is that it comes with a Toa Metru chest armor, that is very useful for most of the current Bionicle sets. Don't being symetrical, the feet are the only thing that affects in the playability. Other than that, the playability (and also the design) have no problem. 

Skrall's color scheme is awesome, better than the other Glatorian sets (in my opinion, it is just not so good as Vorox's), including the good and old red from the 2001-2003's sets, with the common black. As an action figure, it is very good (in some way, the fact that him can't move well his head to left/right makes me remember the good and old Toa Mata sets), he is the only glatorian with a weapon and a shield. In overall, he is a 10/10 with no doubt. This set was made for true Bionicle fans, for who is beginning to collect and for who is interested in action figures. It is also a good try as a first Bionicle set. Just like Vorox, this is highly recommended!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kapoka79","2009-08-08T23:09:26.093Z","The Invincible Skrall!","I have to say this is probably the best Glatorian set so far. Lego did a great job with the Skrall!

Pros: 

-Cool mask 
-Thornax launcher is Awesome
- Good color scheme of red and black
-Cool design on his shield. It's kind of a maze with spikes along the circumference  of it. And it also spins.
-The pointy shoulder armor is also very cool and detailed and doesn't get in the way like Strakk's and Malum's armor does.
-Great Playability
-Fun and easy to pose like all Glatorian.
-Some new pieces including the new hands
-Life Counter
-Has a ton of armor and is really sturdy
(Looks really evil)

Cons:

-A tad bit overpriced in the United States 
-it only comes with 1 thornax. There should be at least 2 I think.

"james3426","2009-10-19T21:57:27.763Z","""We fight, we win, we take.""","This was one of my first two Glatorian I got for Christmas 2008, the other being  Vorox. On to the review.

 Skrall is a cool Glatorian with cool pieces and and a mixture of classic red and black. The Saw Blade Shield looks like a very lethal weapon. I wish there was a lime design so Tuma could have one. The ""Tribal Design Blades"" are good for MOCs. They at first, looked weird on his shoulders, but I got used to them. The helmet is very long in the back and it has, you guessed it, more tribal designs. The head isn't that pose-able and easily falls off, but I try to be careful. His torso is similar to Strakk's: A hunchback.

pros:
Cool helmet
Saw blade shield
Tribal blades
Thornax launcher

Cons:
none.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vexorian","2010-01-24T09:21:16Z","wow","I have now opened the canister and built him. Skrall is such an amazing set in person. Even the build is not that much like the usual one. But once finished he looks so amazing! LEGO did something great with the way the color scheme and weapon/shield design look when complete. By far the most unique looking Bionicle canister I've had so far.

Pros
-----
* The shield! It is hypnotic. It is very ellaborated but not so much that it is overdone. 
* The skrall blades in that color... I've seen Tuma's in the past, but in red these things look really dangerous.
The head is also great looking.
* After seeing many pics I thought he was going to be skinny, but somehow he does not look like that in person. 
* He is seriously alien like.

I am really considering to get a second one just for the fun of using the parts on other things. I love the parts but I love the set as well, so I can't just use them...

Cons.
------
* Thornax launchers: They do shoot and etc, but the Thornax looks lame and the silver is out of place. These things get really old after your 8th or 7th 2009 set... Too good it is LEGO so you can take it out. The launcher parts can be used as spines or weapons in MoCs, so I consider these things as spare pieces.
* Life counter in a very strange location. Took it out as well.
* The shield is hard to pose. I think I will have to tweak it a little and add articulation.
