"dragon_teenager","2009-01-09T17:46:06.123Z","Best fire warrior since Tahu! ","Malum isn't quite as cool as his canister art suggests, but I still love him. The overall look of the model is very complete, armored, and powerful. He looks heavy and lumbering, but immensely strong. His helmet really fits the part, and his claws are awesome- probably the highlight of the set. 

The biggest strike against Malum, I think, is the launcher mounted on his arm. Looks a little silly. 

Otherwise though, this set is great. You won't be disappointed with Malum! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Tri_pod_king","2009-01-18T15:53:22.7Z","Hot-head Malum","First off, I want to get this out of the way- the shoulder armor was surprising. I wouldn't of used them, but still quite creative. The scary part is that they barely ever get in the way! It's great!
             Anyway, I'll 'start' with the mask. It's awesome. I love how it shows the mouth and doesn't cover the whole face. That's a new idea for Bionicle. And just in case you're wondering, the mask attaches onto the top of the head. The claws are great, but they're pretty large. I might've  given him hands, a sword and a shield, though. If you want to fire the Thornax launcher, the best way is to lift his arm, so he's not only firing his powerful weapon, but also shielding himself with his claws.
          Overall, this is a great figure and I highly recommend it.

The other flaw (apart from height)  is that his shoulder armour limits posability.

Finally the height. HE IS TINY (when compared with other glatorian) I'm not sure if malum is a midget glatorian or a giant agori, my money is on the giant agori option!

"Legoman1993","2009-06-29T13:36:53.403Z","Malum the EXiled! :0","This is one of my favorite Glatorian sets! He's got cool claw pieces , a durable body (Carapars), Nice mask and  the Throx launcher. I will break the review in sections.  

The Container:Well it almost looks or has the same idea as the 2006 and 2008(Mistika) ones.  I guess the lid design is somewhat thrilling to look at , because of its shapes. Not like the mahri ones where you can't EVEN STORE THEM! OH NO! :0    

Instructions:Pretty much the same!      

The bioincle itself:WOW! BRILLIANT SET! The colours really stand out! I really like the mix of red and yellow! The mask/helmet is very cool for the fire tribe!It actually has flames on it. Most of the fire bionicles in the past had a design and were just painted red or dark red! The arms are basic as they have been! The claws are the parts that drew my attetion the most!  

First off they were bigger than expected.Second, what made them unique was the fact that they are not sliver like ehlek , it has two talons and it has fire in the back! Cool! The shoulders are ok , but they do get in the way a bit.The chest piece makes him look firm and tough! His legs are the same size in height but has different pieces. He has the 2005 bioincle toa feet but in red colour. In my opinion he is not that short , besides it makes him look strong!   

Overall: GREAT set if you don""t mind the height of the bioincle then I recommed you buy this set now:) you will love it!

"knuclear200x","2009-03-28T23:52:41.327Z","Dang ""Tall, Shiny and Handsome"" Advertising...but it IS still Handsome","The Glatorian line definitely shows a lot of promise and improvement over the series' many years of existence. Now these Bionicles have actual hands, instead of those things that are...supposed to be hands...that can still hold a a sword or two...but what about this little guy? 

TRU had this pretty cool sales offer, where if you spend $30 on a lego purchase, you get a free 221-piece bucket, the promo ended on the 28th of March. That was good enough reason for me to finally buy this guy along with one of the Gadunka's they had left. 

I'll start with the CONS. After building, I noticed how the finished product looked a little...shorter than advertised. I mean look at the box art. Look how tall it is, how shiny it is, and look how it...almost has the same build as Prowl from Transformers Animated. But I look at the figure itself and it looks almost nothing like on the box. There are also a lot of posing issues. The shoulder plates get in the way as they either hit Malum's head or chestplate. The elbows aren't very flexible either. There's an obstruction that keeps you from rotating it so you can only bend it up or down, and you cant switch since its going to hard putting the claws on the obstructing side. It also doesn't have a weapon. The claws are nice and all, but a sword or something would've been a nice addition. Even though the figure has no hands with which to hold.

But despite all this, the figure still has many PROS. Though it's not as tall, it still looks great, there are a lot of ways to give it cool poses if you work around the obstructions and you may end up forgetting they're there. The flaming helmet and the firey claws show very well that it's a fire element . The feet are also new, and they almost look like small spacecrafts. And probably the coolest thing ever, is the Bionicle skull. It's not that long-faced skull with insert-light-piping eyes. It's just an orange, regular-shaped, transparent skull...that looks like Iron Man. Yup. Iron Man. I've never enjoyed removing the helmet before. Sure, it's not so cool without the helmet, but it's still an awesome skull.

Other Stuff: 
The line also introduces a new firing weapon, a squeeze-firing claw that shoots a spiked mine, or the Thornax Launcher. And there's this life counter you plug into the back of the figure. It reminds me of the late Xevoz. It's really just a wheel that locks in place when you turn it. Not a really useful feature, but it doesn't get in the way. Looks nice too.

Cons:
-Shorter than advertised
-Not Shiny...
-Shoulder pads get in the way of posing
-No additional weapons.

Pros:
-Ah being shorter than advertised aint so bad. It still looks great.
-Ah being shiny isn't THAT important
-Great firey claws and helmet
-Nice shoes
-the ""Iron Man"" skull
-A lot of potential in posing

Overall:
After playing with it a little, I've noticed this figure isn't so bad. I was going to give it a four, but I realized that it would need a lot more flaws to deserve a four. It just looks too awesome, nice posing capability, and good armor design.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cignal","2009-06-26T18:22:58.247Z","Brilliant looking... but issues with posability and he has dwarfism."," Sweet looking scheme, although grey isn't all that aesthetically pleasing. LEGO recycled here Barraki Carapar's design, but it's not that bad. Carapar is probably my favorite Barraki, Mantax being the best in my view.

  Malum has severe posability issues with shoulder armor being too bulky, but when you get it straight he's just striking standing there in menacing pose. Also hands/Claws can't move all that much. I guess this figure is made mostly for standing on the shelf being all awesome looking. 

 Maybe I've got a faulty one, but his hip joints are unbelievably weak, in some poses I can't even get him standing up. Hopefully not all Malum-owners suffer from this issue. 

  All in all great set in my opinion. Must be because this is my first and only Glatorian and I didn't buy any Bionicles in several months. But as an appetizer, this is brilliant! I really should get other Glatorian as well. 

  Little brother has VOROX and boy is Vorox great set! Vorox really stands out, and not just because of his color scheme - the Predator mask design and overall Scorpion-Predator hybrid look is unbelievable! 

  Malum may be suffering from severe case of dwarfism, but he makes it with his width (I mean bulk!). Thigh armor could've been bigger, if he's supposed to be ""Glatorian on Steroids"", as people in America use to say. 
 And here are the ""must be included"" points in review:

PROs - ""Just go get him already!""
- Color scheme and color transitions
- Firy coolness factor
- Nicely designed Roman Gladiator looking Helmet
- Poses he can get into are sweet
- Doesn't take too much space (short)
- Many recolored, useful pieces
- Wicked Fire Claws are a ""must get""
- Thornax Launcher really works, and well
- Thornax Fruit projectile has a nice bronze look to it

CONs - ""Minor Comments""
- Posing issues with bulky shoulder armor
- Doesn't take too much space aka TOO SHORT!
- Mask and skull are tiny
- Why can't LEGO stop using those terrible blue pins? 
- Empty looking back
- Weak hip joints (mine defected?)
- Not a lot of new molds
- Paper-thin waist (a fashion model?)
- Minor design gripes

"Gus_263","2009-03-07T14:17:40.45Z","Beware the Exile!","Malum is one of the most recent Bionicle sets, from the subtheme Glatorian. Although in the S@H description was said that he is an ally of Raanu, story wise it is wrong, as he was exiled from his village (Vulcanus) and now he wanders in the wastelands, and his only allies are the Vorox. Storyline apart, Raanu was designed with Malum, what makes him looks like more with Malum than Ackar, the next red canister set from the subtheme Glatorian Legends (that will be released summer 09).<br/><br/>As a canister set, this have an average number of pieces (but he is the Glatorian set with more pieces), 59. I'll not complain about this because I usually get sets with the prices up to three times the US' price, thereare just few cases when I get some sets from UK. But I honestly think it worth way more than Mistika sets like Krika, who have a bad piece count (40, close to a rip-off). Building is not good due to the few number of pieces, not for the pieces themselves, but the true objective of canister sets is playability instead of building.<br/><br/>The building is simple, the limbs are the same, the body is in the same design as 2006, and the armors are re-used. It have two useful pieces that connects the Thornax launcher and the head. For more details about the Thornax, check the reviews of other Glatorians that I made previously. As different and interesting things, there stands his shoulder armors (that actually are feet). And also his flame claws, with Visorak paw pieces connected at the top of the claws, which makes a good design, at least better than the flame claw pieces alone.<br/><br/>The Playability of the set is great too. Although he has the building of an Inika set, he is a bit smaller than a Toa Metru, not a perfect size, but a very good size to an action figure, at least as avariation to the repetitive figures. His armors are not the best, but are very good with the arms (what makes he look like strong, something that isn't common with the red characters), and move just a bit worst than Vorox's armors as shoulder armors, but not something very bad that makes it a con, also because it is the objective of the armors.<br/><br/>So, comparing with the other Glatorian sets, Malum doesn't have a good color scheme, the gray is very repeated (what make it useful, though), and it doesn't even combine well with the red and yellow (and also with the orange details). The building is simple, but he has a good playability for his size. The design, just like all the sets of this subtheme, is awesome. The helmet fits perfectly with his head, though it can't fit with any mask.<br/><br/>In overall, Malum is awesome. His playability is very good, his design is fantastic and the building is what we can expect for a regular sized set. So, Malum is unique. Also in the storyline, his characteristics and acts in the are something that we never had before in the Bionicle story. I don't think he is the best Glatorian set, but is a very good option, and the Glatorian with the best price per piece!",TRUE,5,4,3,4,3
