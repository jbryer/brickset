Not that i didn't know  the the body style was just the inika's. But, when the set was finished, It looks pretty cool. Lego fixed the head problem, by means of a new piece that connects with two pins. One of the few pieces that ingtruiged me was the head (the hands were neat, but the head was really something) It looks exactly like iron man, which is VERY cool to me. Gresh Also includes a new Thornax Launcher, which is only rivaled by the zamor sphere, it is so small, and so simple, yet so fun, but, sadly, you only get 1 thornax. Now onto the Pros and cons
    PROS
.New Mask
.Awesome Thornax Launcher
.Iron Man head
.hand pieces
.cool dragon wing like swords that can combine into a shield
.bionicle action figure game
     Cons.
.12.99 is a little steep for 55 Pieces
.big gap between his body and his armour
.only 1 thornax
.Bionicle action game",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"18000pieces","2009-01-12T19:49:28.153Z","I unknowingly picked the main character!","I picked this up at TRU the other day along with Loot Island (strange, I know, but I liked them both), and was very pleased. Firstly, he does have the same arms as he does legs, but it works better than with Tahu because he has a long body. He is very tall, I'd guess about eight inches. Still a head shorter than Krika, who I think is the tallest canister set every (I'll have to check him against Vorox). Having recieved the comic book yesterday, I am almost certain that he is the main character, which is a major pro. I was getting tired of the main characters being fire. Anyways,

Pros -
-Epic Swords (they're skinnier than they look like they ought to be, though)
-Cool mask
-Freakishly good color scheme
-Thornax launcher is good, nice and compact (I immediately lost my thornax under a chair, though, and didn't have a spare)
-Cool mask
-Face looks suspiciously like Iron Man, especially in orange.
-Action figure game is explained in instructions
-Launcher finally has a point for existence
-Lego has perfected its canister set design and is sticking to it, giving maximum poseability/playability.
-This series finally fits in the storyline with some of the others (namely, the phantoka/mistika toa, takanuva, and Toa Matoro)

Cons - 
-Thanks to new head design which eliminates the old version with the creepy mouth that looks like it will suck out your soul, the mask is incompatible with other bionicles (I always thought it was fun to switch out their masks.)
-Only one Thornax
-Poor body design makes the chest plate stick out from the body, resulting in an unsightly gap.

Despite its flaws, the fact that Gresh is the new main character alone makes him worth buying.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Republic_Commando_Sev","2009-01-18T21:16:57.967Z","The Best Glatorian","I'm back on Brickset, and I hope that my reviews will be helpful!

Once I saw Gresh I really wanted him, so when I saw him at Toys R Us, I snatched him up immedietly. 

He has many many new and recolored pieces, including Gorast claws, the new Sheild, Thornax Launcher, Mask and the new hands.

The Box: The box is pretty large, and on the front it shows Gresh shooting at an unseen person. He looks really good on there.
On the back, it shows him in another pose, with swords instead of a sheild. It also shows his Matoran, Tarduk, which I'll do a review of later.

The Build: Once you dump out the pieces, you see a lot of Light Green, Black, and Dark Green pieces. Gresh has many good pieces, which makes up for the $13 price tag. You start by building the body, then legs, arms then head and weapons. It's a fast build, but pretty fun.

The Finished Product: The finished product is stunning. Light Green and Dark Green look fantastic together, and the use of the Gorast Claws is ingenius. 
Gresh's Mask is one of the best masks Lego has made, it looks good, and is pretty small actually. I like how when it goes back, it splits off into three seperate sections.
The new red piece that the mask goes into, is a very very cool piece, although it's not compatible with any other masks except for the Glatorian masks. 
A lot of people hate the skinny legs, but I think they look good. It makes him look like he's from the jungle, and it makes it look like he has good agility.
I don't like the gap in the body, but it's not too bad. I figured out a way to fix it, without removing or adding pieces, and I hope to post it on BZPower soon, so in my future reviews, I'll put a link up, so you guys can fix it.

The Weapons: The sheild is very very cool, I love how it can split up into two seperate pieces, which can be used as swords, which it shows in the instructions, and on the back of the box. One thing I do, is remove the Thornax Launcher, and put the two sheild parts on Gresh, like real swords, not the way they show on the instructions. He looks really great!

The Thornax Launcher is the best launcher in Bionicle ever. It's small, light, and shoots extremely well! I love the the Thornax Launcher. The ammo is so awesome, and I love how it's soooo rubbery. It's cool, because when you shoot it, it bounces! It's bigger then I expected, but is still great.

The Hands: A lot of people don't like the hands, but I LOVE them. I'm so glad Lego made real hands, they look awesome on Gresh, and any other Glatorian.

Overall: Gresh is the best Glatorian. Seriously, I really recommend getting him, you will not be disspointed!

I hope you enjoyed this review, and I really hope you buy Gresh!

"Dragon_fire","2009-02-22T12:51:45.343Z","COOLNESS","This is the best glatorian out there, he is also the tallest! The shoulder armour is cool and he also holds the thornax launcher differently, which looks cool.

The other good thing about Gresh is that his shield can become the two blades on his arms, my personal favourite.

If you want a glatorian, this is the best",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-01-18T17:50:08.997Z","He deserves to be a main character!","I just got Gresh today in a local Target, and my little brother Joe got Malum.  I love Gresh!  He is very sleek looking with that totally slick color scheme.  His twin swords can easily slide into one hand for a large shield, and his Thornax launcher shoots quite far and is very accurate.  There is a small space between body and armor, but you can hardly notice it.  The Thornax, by the way, is a rubber ball with spikes and a plastic band around it to help with shooting.  His mask matches his blades on his shoulder and thighs, and altogether he deserves the rank of main character for the 2009 storyline and a 5/5!

Pros:

-Swords/shield are really neat

-Color scheme is totally wicked

-Mask matches blades on thighs and shoulders

-Thornax launcher shoots well

Cons:

-Space between body and armor

-Lego's getting stingy with the ammo (only one Thornax)

Altogether, a set well worth $12.99 US.  Get him ASAP!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-31T10:32:54.22Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Glatorian) - Gresh Review","This is a cool figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved. Each hand has a cool looking weapon and on one hand you can also see a thornax launcher which will shoot the balls very well. I really like the design of this figure and I also love the colors which LEGO has chosen for this set. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All

"chavez365","2009-11-08T05:08:07.14Z","A Jungle Warrior With Painful Inaccuracy!","Gresh was my first Glatorian and is my favorite Glatorian. He is a really fantastic set! First, you have the new(and cool) hands, and the iron man-like head. He really looks like a jungle warrior, with his spiky armor and different shades of green. His weapons are both cool, and can be combined to make a shield. His mask is another thing entirely; a sort of helmet, with a very tough look. And the rest of the set is great too!
All of these traits make Gresh a fantastic Glatorian, and he really is ""A jungle warrior!""",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KodakKid365","2010-11-17T18:01:24.72Z","Sheild is super cool.","Gresh is a very nice set. He comes with the traditional thornax launcher and his awesome shield. It can either be a huge shield, (and can be used as a weapon) or where you put each half of it under his hands. It's cool to d that and put a thornax in each hand.",FALSE,4,5,4,5,4
