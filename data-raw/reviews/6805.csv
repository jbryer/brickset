Tarix has a lot of new pieces: masks, heads, hands, and swords.  The masks now attach on the top of the head instead of the front of it, the heads now have eyes and mouths, the hands are more lifelike, and the swords are translucent.  Second: The colors.  Blue is nice, but dark blue is better.  And when combined with gold, well, that's just amazing(I love gold.).  Third: The Thornax.  The Thornax is amazing.  It shoots well, it's rubber, and it's gold(Did I mention I love gold?).  Lastly: The life counter.  There is a new Bionicle Battle Game, and it requires a life counter to participate.  So you can use Tarix for the game!  Overall, this set is, and I have used this word many times, amazing.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2009-09-11T21:30:15.39Z","Awesome set!","Set review: 8981 - Tarix
This is a set released during the first season of 2009, part of the Glatorian subtheme. Now there are the newest Bionicle sets (Glatorian Legends) that also take the same role in the plot of the year (some of them even appear in the new movie, including Tarix). As a set, Tarix includes 57 pieces, and use the same style of building of the Inika sets (style that was started in 2006).

First of all, to review a Bionicle set, we need first understand what Bionicle sets are (this will clarify the things for who don't understand the theme). They are Buildable action figures, that used to have manual functions (as results of complex Technic construction), most of them through gears. It stopped sometime between 2005 and 2006 (the Visorak do included some functions, though they had no gears, and the Hordika had few functions/gears). Since then, Bionicle stopped to innovate in main pieces/building, to innovate with what it already had (bodies/limbs/head...). 

As for now, it got re-used parts (what was already expected - it is something common in every Lego theme), and now it have some pieces designed firstly for one use (weapons/helmets), as they now focus in design, and also because without those pieces, the sets wouldn't take personality (it don't means the pieces have no other uses, it is something that depends very much in MOCing ability). The set I'll review, Tarix, is one of the sets that is included in this category.

Pieces
The pieces are most re-uses, though that, this is one of the three canister sets that have long Dark blue connectors, and the best choice to get them (the other is Gali [8688], a really poor set, compared to this; and Gelu, that is one of the most re-used sets ever, that have pretty much the same body as Tarix). The newest pieces are the hands, the head, and the head connector. The head is completely translucent, unfortunately (and it is really small). The hands are too big for the head alone, though that, it is nice in design. The connector of the head is very useful, and discards any Av-Matoran/Agori Body.

The exclusive pieces here are the Water Blades (Though asymmetrical and dual-colored, they are fantastic!) and his helmets. Both of those pieces feature an elemental feel of water. Again, something that was missing since the first Toa sets (from 2007 to now, the Toa sets looked like more armored soldiers than elemental warriors). It is a very good improvement that the set designers did.

Construction:
As I explained before, it have re-used parts and re-used techniques of building, as it is following the padrons that Lego decided to give for the theme (now every regular theme has it, just look at City - the limit of size is over 6 studs). But anyways, it still has memorable innovations. The color scheme and the body armor (not that great innovation, but a nice add that was lacking for other ""Inika-building"" sets), for example.

Design:
The silver and golden colors add a royal feel to the set. Without silver, it look like there is something missing, as the mask is attached to a silver tube, that is directly connected to the silver life counter (which only good use here is like as a ""bag"" or as source for a Metru chest piece, because the action figure game adds nothing). 

Different of what some people think, the color scheme is one of the best in the history of the theme, ever. We get Blue again (that was missing since a great time), with a Dark Blue body (which reminds very well a uniform). The hands and feet were the best place for the blue color (it reminds me gloves/shoes, showing a bit more realistic disposition of colors, another point that was missing in some sets before and even after this).

The ""royal"" colors are also nice additions. The critics against those are really pointless. If it is one of those colors that ""frustrates"", it is so easy to take it out from the set. As I said before, the silver is mixed very well; though there are few parts with this color (it includes even those ""horns"" in the armor, which are actually system pieces).

Playability:
As a Buildable action figure, of course it gets an awesome playability. Me and a lot of Bionicle fans would like to have functions once again in the sets, but anyways, it is good as it is (and for what it was made). There are like 13 point of articulation. The only thing that frustrates is the Thornax (the major con of the set). It is only useful as a source of pieces, besides that, it is just bad placed and makes the design of the set worst (it just serves for the action figure game that really don't add much things).

Overall:
Tarix is a great addition to any Bionicle collection. Comparing to the recent sets, he stays in the top, as one of the best choices (I would say Vorox still better, as I am a great fan of brown/tan Bionicle). The 2009 canister sets marks for Lego a reproaching to the first elemental sets (as for exclusive designed parts and for the color schemes), while keeping  the same building and re-used parts (what is more common in Glatorian Legends sets, as example, Mata Nui and Gelu). Buying this set alongside with Kiina and Berix is a great choice also. Recommended for Bionicle fans, just like me (2001ites will probably enjoy the colors, so it is recommended for them also!).

"james3426","2009-11-02T18:46:30.81Z","""I fight with intelligence and elegance.""","     People are saying that Tarix is one of the worst Glatorian. Not true! He is almost better than Vorox or Gresh in my opinion. His water blades are very cool with those gold bases and translucent blue blades. These also make him look cool when you pose him, so it looks like he is paring them. The thornax launcher, as always, if you squeeze it in the right place, it fires far. I really like the golden armor on his chest, shoulders, and legs, which I think is a better shade of gold than the older 2003-2005 shade of gold. The helmet looks like a diver's helmet, and I have always wondered why he has that tube. It does not even say anything about that on BS01 Wiki. The spikes on his shoulders make him look like a true warrior, but they fall off easily. I lost one of these, but hopefully this friend that I have will let me have one. His hands and feet, which people say stick out, do not bother me much.

pros:
Gold armor.
Water blades.
Diver helmet.
Thornax launcher.
Looks good in many poses.

cons:
Spikes on shoulders fall off.

Tarix is a great Glatorian. I recommend him to any Bionicle fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
