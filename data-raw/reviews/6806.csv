Strakk has some relly cool features and I especially like the ice elements and the color scheme. It even includes some of the new hand pieces which are pretty cool looking and are very useful. Strakk also has a new head connector piece which is blue and is sort of like the matoran of light head pieces. His body also has an interesting construction to it. If you want one of the new bionicle sets, this should be on the top of your list.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Its got really cool elements like his head piece and shoulder pieces
it also has a ax. the spike ball shooter who's name escapes me. it comes with a new game thing called &quot;bionicle action figure game&quot; its where you shoot your opponent with the spike thing and there a score keeper made right in to the bionicles them selfs.

"dragon_teenager","2008-12-28T12:47:18.233Z","Glatorian FTW","Strakk is my first Glatorian, but he won't be the last. LEGO's aesthetics have really taken a step forward since the dismal 2008 wave, and my Bionicle fanhood is being rekindled! 

First off: Strakk is built differently from the other Glatorian, in that his body is actually bent at a 90 degree angle with an armor piece fitted diagonally on the inside of the angle. Otherwise he's pretty generically built, with old arm and leg armor, and only a few new parts. 

However, these new parts are brilliant. His mask is savage and aggressive, an awesome departure from the silver-heavy 2008 look. He has these huge ice...uh... shoulder pads that LOOK really cool, although I'm not sure how useful they'll be to MOCists. 

And finally, his weapon is probably the coolest I have ever seen. Seriously, we haven't gotten a weapon this kick butt since Tahu's fire sword, a full eight years ago. The set is almost worth getting just for that.

All of the Glatorian are a little expensive, but that's because there's an abundance of large new parts. I really enjoyed this set, but unfortunately I can't say how he stacks up against the other Glatorian. All I know is, he won't disappoint you. 

Highly recommended! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2009-01-23T14:41:05.967Z","Warrior of Iconox","Strakk is a Glatorian that fights for the village of Iconox, according to the Bionicle storyline. This set was released this season, and like the medium-sized Bionicle sets, it costs 13 US dollars.

The Glatorians' canister is similar to the canisters from the Toa Inika and Mahri in some points, like the black color and some details on the sides. The design of the canister and the CGI image shown on its front and back are very good, with a standardized color scheme based in blue and white schemes.

Strakk is the Glatorian that includes less pieces than all the other Glatorians, being exactly 46 pieces. It is very few compared to other sets like the 8689 (Toa Tahu, from yesteryear's subtheme Mistika), but they are useful to Bionicle creations at least.

The most notable new pieces are his mask/helmet (it can be called as a mask or a helmet), axe, armors from his arms and his Thornax launcher. The color schemes of the armors, axe and mask are very-well designed, and clear, but they are not useful in other ways, due to their details and compatibility. Anyway, the pieces can be very useful to Bionicle sets (or MOCs) of the element of ice.

The Thornax launcher is a firing weapon included with all the Glatorians and included also with all the warriors from this year. It is a very compatible weapon, because is not so heavy like the Cordak or Midak blasters, and it is made of two pieces on each side and the projectile.
It is easy to shot and works very well.

Another new piece included with Strakk is his translucent light blue head, that is included also with the 8976 (Metus). It has the same mold as the other Glatorians' and Agori's heads, and the helmet is connected above the head, unlike the other molds of heads from the Bionicle theme. The face looks like the Iron-man's face, and is very well-design, making it not so useful.

Like the other Glatorian, Strakk have a ""Life counter"", located on his back. It looks like a cog, but have colored details, marking the lifes of the warrior with the numbers 1-5 and a skull. It is not very useful, but is used in the new ""Bionicle Action figure game"", that you can check in www.bionicle.com

Strakk also includes the new molds of hands, like some of the other Glatorian and Agori. They are nice in design, but aren't useful as any other thing just due to it.

There is no much to say about the Strakk's building, it is very similar to the same building used in the Toa Inika from 2006, but with some differences. You can check the building instructions for Strakk in this link: http://bionicle.lego.com/en-us/gallery/BuildingInstructions/glatorian/StrakkGroup/Strakk.aspx

The building is very easy to do, without complex techniques. The playability is very good, of course, as it is a buildable action figure, it has 13 points of articulation due to the balljoint connections.
 
Overall, this set is nice, but don't includes many useful pieces. The price is not so high (in some other countries, it costs three times more than 13 dollars, and The Lego Company will not make it way more cheap, so there is not why complain about this), and if you are a big Bionicle fan who likes new pieces and well-designed sets, it is strongly recommended.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Tri_pod_king","2009-01-18T16:06:12.357Z","Ice-cold Strakk","Has anyone noticed that Strakk and Skrall have similar name structures? It's craziness. Anyway, Strakk is a pretty awesome Glatorian. His construction his smart, but his head jiggles around, just like some of the Phantoka. Yah, and just like the Phantoka, it's pretty annoying. Other than that, he's awesome. His ax is just plain amazing. His icy shoulders are cool, but can sometimes be awkward while playing with him. The Thornax launcher launches far, but sometimes the ammo falls out. I forgot to mention that about Skrall. With Malum It's not so much of a problem.
       Overall, this figure is awesome and I recommend him. I might not recommend him as much as Skrall and Malum, but still.

"Arkahn","2009-01-30T20:33:19.31Z","Strakk, good or evil?","Well, first things first, new parts:
 head = things to note, there are input points at the top of the head, and where the ""ears"" would be. so, no old masks what-so-ever.

the hands are really neat. adds some dimension to a character holding weapons.

the counter is interesting but it sticks out a bit..unnaturally from his, err, back?

as for the thornax launcher, it fires about just as good as the zamor launcher surprisingly and isn't at all hindered by the thorns on it.

overall, I would say a good set for collectors and moc'ers alike. plus, it's finally a new design using old parts! and surprisingly the color scheme doesn't clash too much.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"DXD","2009-02-14T03:06:52.937Z","Only sell-out: Head and Shoulders","Strakk, like all of these Glatorian of 2009 are quite unique, fresh, and new with designs and attributes that match well with their now-expected elemental forms.

Strakk, I'm afraid to say, is on the slightly lack side of the group, and here's why:


-Strakk's physical build is a bit too gangly for my liking(when compared with others such as Malum), even when complimented with what armour attatchments he was given.

-His ice axe weapon doesn't seem to measure up too well with Strakk's gangliness.

-Thus, this makes play and posing quite a dissapointment in ANY Bionicle fan's fields of regular fancy.


  However, as the title of this review states, the only reason for my purchase of this set was due to the utter loss of shopper's sense of overflow of visual appeal at the well put-together box art, mainly Strakk's new mask and shoulder armour which complimented him, his element, and his surroundings perfectly.

I recently got back into bionicle and was very excited. Yesterday, I got Malum(I'll review him later) and this guy. I tried so hard to like strakk but I just couldn't. He looks like he was kicked in the stomach and it didn't quite fill back in. He looks like a two legged ice giraffe with that super long neck. The head is way too small for his body. I don't know if I got a defect, but the head has a blue line in the center. He looks like he was sick and needs a cane.

The main thing that I find unique about him is his torso. It's a really neat way of using old parts to make something completely new. And that old shoulder pad looks great as a chest plate. His shoulder pads are also very cool, and the tips of the icicles are rubbery. Very cool. His mask is great with that fiendish and deceitful grin and the icicles make it look like a crown. Very cool. Although maybe that blue stripe down the center of his face could be taken out?

His new ice axe was bigger than I expected and looks like the meanest weapon Bionicle have ever produced. Very cool. His life counter is in a good position unlike Skrall and Vorox, and his hunchback makes him seem somehow even more treacherous. The 'Strakk Neck' as people are starting to call it I actually find quite fitting with the character, and no, captain radda radda, it does NOT make him look like an ice giraffe.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cignal","2009-08-19T15:51:48.373Z","Impressive parts design!"," The canister graphics doesn't do justice to ""awesomeness"" of cool Strakk. You have to build him and see him in real life - then you will really appreciate the marvel of his icy parts and overall design! 

 Torso build is very innovative, this is not your ""Inika-clone"" (I really get tired of using that word so much these days). The hunchback stature and ""Strakk-neck"" are not negative points in his design. They are the keys to what makes him unique and really menacing looking!

 Sure, old parts are used a lot but the Axe, Shoulder armor and Mask make up for it. Axe is probably the Biggest, Baddest weapon ever! Sure, Lhikan's weapons are bigger but Strakk's Axe is just a marvel of TLG parts design team! Get Strakk just to witness the beauty of his new Icy pieces, some have even the rubbery component to them.
 
 Strakk has the same evil grin as Thok, my favorite Piraka. That is just priceless! All in all very good canister set, much better than I anticipated. Sometimes you just can't judge by figure's picture. It's the figure itself that has or has not the ""wow"" factor. And Strakk definitely has it! The best Glatorian, hands down!

"dso1997_9","2012-04-15T11:17:37.563Z","Strakk: Ice Warrior","Strakk is a Glatorian for the Ice Tribe.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>His head is uniquely styled and used. The piece seems to illustrate the angry side of the character as well as his ""cold"" demeanor. Most Glatorian helmets tend to transfer well onto another character, even of a different tribe when the color is changed. Strakk's helmet fits him and only him. Even Metus, his Agori counterpart, looks awkward wearing this large, imposing helmet. This may seem negative, but on the contrary, it is refreshing to see a piece with a singular intention.<br></li></ul><ul><li>His torso design is also one-of-a-kind. By the cover art, I would never have assumed Strakk had such an unusual assembly. Upon finishing, I examined his odd, hunched back and decided it fit him. The Inika shoulder doesn't hurt either.</li></ul><ul><li>The axe Strakk hoists is amazing. On another website, the Bionicle Reviews Wiki, one of the administrators cynically points out that Strakk's weapon is approximately the same height as Nuhrii, a 2004 Matoran. To me, this does not seem to be an issue, as the weapon is fitting of Strakk figure and traits. Axe's like Axonn's, of 2006, are powerful and formidable, but the asymmetry of Strakk's execution-type weapon is equally effective.</li></ul><ul><li>Strakk, as a whole, is a very good fighter. He looks good in opposition to other figures, most notably, Ackar. Of the Glatorian I have, Strakk most resembles a gladiator. Lined up alongside other figures I have from 2009, Strakk best fits the gladiatorial intentions of Bionicle. <br></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Again with the Thornax?! It is obvious the creators of the Glatorian line were in search of a uniform weapon to fit each figure released in 2009. The Thornax seems to be their solution. Weapons like Zamor Sphere Launchers, Midak Syblasters, and Cordak Blasters possessed adequate functionality and Kanoka Disks and Kanohi Masks were collectable. Clearly, the Thornax were intended to be the former, but their tendency to fall from their shooter pieces is aggravating and disappointing.</li></ul><ul><li>Despite their imposing appearance, the shoulder plates are difficult to move and limit the horizontal movements of the arms. I do think the shoulder plates look very fitting, but a decrease in size, in this one case, would have been for the best. Similar to Gelu's Ice Slicers, these shoulder plates are rubbery and, supposedly, child friendly. Regardless of how much of a choking hazard the pieces are, Lego must make sure that they don't cause minor incisions into the skin (sarcasm).</li></ul><p>Generally, this set is quite good. I am usually drawn towards the Ice and Fire characters, such as Strakk. I would recommend this set to any who are looking for standout figures or a varied collection.</p><p><br></p><p>By Vakama<br></p><ul><li><br></li></ul>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
