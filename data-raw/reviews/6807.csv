"Gus_263","2009-02-16T16:49:00.123Z","""Beware my stinger tail!"" ","This is one of the best (if not, the best) of the Glatorian sets! Awesome design, color scheme and contents! In the storyline, Vorox are not Glatorian at all. They are like savage warriors who attacks in packs and have no affiliation with the social system of other Glatorian. They have no village (and were nomads many years ago) and they lurks in the sands of the Bara Magna's Wastelands. 

It's new pieces are the Thornax launcher (made with four pieces), the Thornax explosive fruit (a sphere of rubber with eight spikes and a ""ring"" in it's center to fits in the launcher), the hands (a cool new mold, not useful to some weapons, but awesome in design and to make it hang most of the weapons), the head (a mold that is awesome in design, but it is small like a old hand mold and unfortunately it is completely translucent) and of course the mask (very well designed). And also the armors of limbs, that are like the whole set, very well designed. They are the only parts in the set that includes brown.

The building of the set is easy, based in the Inika building with the add of a tail (interestingly it uses the Av-Matorans' feet connected to an Agori limb and then, to a Toa metru's leg, that have a blade in the top). With a tail, there is no need for an armor in the chest, so don't have how complain about it.  The head is connected with a Toa metru's arm, what fits perfectly to move it.  The legs/arms like the Mistika sets are symetrical (what though not so proportional, are awesome in design, and one of the best shapes to the playability of the set), with difference in the position of armors and of course, the feet.  

As an action figure, it is awesome. The only problem are the armors in the arms, that don't make the arms move well at all, but there is no big problem as it was made to design. The head is not so good to move, like an Av-matoran's one. It can't move well to left/right, but as it have a Toa Metru's arm, it is at least better than in some sets. It also includes a life counter for the new Bionicle Action figure game. It's not so good, but it is a good point that they include a Toa Metru chest armor (what is really useful for Bionicle sets), so I recommend you don't use the game to get that piece.

The colors of that set are in my opinion the best colors of all the Glatorian. The tan color is one of the most awesome colors for Bionicle figures ever, and I really don't know how it became so rare (I've heard that brown/tan sets didn't sell well, but I think that Vorox will be one of the most successful regular-sized Bionicle sets). If you liked sets like Pohatu (from 2001 and Pohatu Nuva from 2002), this is the best option of a Glatorian set. That color scheme is way better than the Pohatu Phantoka's scheme (who could have this to look like more his first versions), and also more attractive. Though that, such rarity makes this color not so good to MOCs, except if you get two or more Vorox.

The weapons of the sets are good, they are just like the main weapons of Hewkii Mahri. A smaller blade at the stinger tail and a sword in his left hand. The Thornax launcher can launch well the ammo, it is not so heavy and is useful in most of the regular-sized figures, as well in titans/warriors sets.

Overall, I recommend Vorox to Bionicle fans, who is starting in this theme, and also to fans of the older Bionicle sets (like Pohatu). It's a very good option for Action figure (I think that true Bionicle fans would not complain about it, in Playability, Building and Contents), and for Bionicle/Action figure MOCs. Of course it have pieces compatible with Technic, but the set alone would not take a good number of pieces for technic. In a honest comparison with regular-sized Bionicle sets, it is a 10 out of 10. Highly recommended!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Urgthetroll","2009-06-04T21:43:31.78Z","Vorox, masters of the desert","Beware the Vorox!  With new solid-colored Piraka feet, new armor and head, the Vorox will defeat you.

But you still have a chance because the Vorox only has a salvaged Toa Mahri warblade and stinger.  

With a swing and a swish of the tail, you are knocked unconscious.

"Kapoka79","2009-07-23T13:53:46.623Z","Sand Tribe Warrior","Vorox is the best of all the Glatorian that have come out this year. 

Pros:

Easy to Stand
Very nice stinger tail 
A cool mask

For the first time ever bionicle figures have hands
There are some cool and recently new pieces with this set

Only comes with one thornax. There should be at least 2

Overall its great and i recommend it should be the first on your bionicle list this year",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoC_C","2009-04-17T02:15:16.42Z","I think it's good","So far, this has been my first Glatorian, and I am pretty happy with it.

Pros.
well armed
well armored
has new armor
tail reaches far
switching around weapons can create very interesting models
joints move well

Cons.
chest feels exposed
armor is connected a little oddly
joints move TOO well

About the joints, this probably only happened to me. Basically, the joints can move so freely that when I accidently moved something, the arm whipped up and smacked the head with the side of the sword.

Anyways, go ahead and buy this set. It is great, and the cons are actually nothing to think about too much. This set also provides some new parts too.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-03-31T12:52:39.873Z","Scourge to Agori Travellers (or meddling Skrall)!","I got this set yesterday for my birthday (I turned 14 [is there any other people who are fourteen and like BIONICLES? Write a review in reply!]), and I'm glad I got it.  The Thornax, as usual, shoots nice and far, and the color scheme looks nice.  The tail is a little hard to swing forward and backward because the joints are so new, but I think after a little bit of posing and playing they'll loosen up.  One thing I don't understand, though, is the use of long blue pins to fix the armor onto the arms and legs instead of the normal shorter black ones.  The rest of the blue pin just sticks out and serves no purpose and looks a little odd; you can probably see it in the pic, at the right leg in particular.  Except for that little blip on the screen, Vorox is a great set to add to your 2009 collection.

Pros:

-Nice scorpion mask (scary too)

-Somewhat different

-Thornax and launcher

-Stinger

-BIONICLE action figure game (good for younger kids, also good for bigger kids with a bunch of the 2009 BIONICLES; the game is just a little too short with only two Glatorian)

-Nice blades

-Brown and tan is back

Cons:

-Long blue pins on armor sticks out

-Shortness of BIONICLE action figure game

-Recycled blade

Overall, 5/5, this is a great set, and these cons are easily fixed or lived with.  Great to match with Malum and Zesk.
One question, though.  Do any of you BIONICLE maniacs (I am one I'm proud to say) know whether or not the Vorox fight in the annual Arena Magna tournaments?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-10-11T01:32:45.013Z","Sand Nomad of Bara Magna","Vorox is one of the best Bionicle's Lego have ever made in my opinion. He has heaps of new pieces and is really fun to play with. I'm gonna say that the shoulder and leg armour is Vorox's because it comes in Skrall but Vorox is better so he gets them. The stinger tail is great to and Lego have cleverly used the original Toa foot as a tail base. The mask is simply great ingenuity. It looks scary and scorpion-like, a combination which could be a serious threat to even Mata Nui.

Pros:
Awesome Mask
Spear
Stinger Tail
Armour
Thornax shoots consistently

Cons:
NONE!

Vorox is well worth buying and is a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-17T15:31:02.013Z","""Hungry, or just angry,you think?""","This is a great set to pose or play around with. He is my favorite original Glatorian (I also have Skrall and Malum, my brother has the other three). I like making different weapons for him because, I heard Vorox carry swords and spears. The tail is a cool, unusual addition that adds to the points of articulation. These new armor pieces are good for MOCing and have a nice blend of tan and brown. These feet are the first completely single-colored Piraka feet. The helmet is my favorite piece in this set because, it has very detailed pincers and has texture.

                                                   Pros:
                                              Fun to pose.
                                              Stinger Tail.
                                    Nice blended armor pieces.
                                       Tan goes well with black.
                            Strakk neck looks good on him for once.

                                                    Cons:
                            Life Counter is on his foot. (miner con)

I recommend this to any Bionicle fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
