Skirmix is probaly the best part of this set. Fero is cool but basicly a normal Agori with a Thornax launcher
All in all this set is well worth $19.99. and is the best Bionicle of 2009 so far.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Vrahno","2009-08-13T09:38:01.843Z","I love this raptor!","So I was a little disappointed when I bought this set, not because I didn't want it, but because it was not the one I was looking for, and had to ""force"" myself to buy it, since I figured it was a good opportunity to do so. But still, it was not the set I anticipated getting, so I left the store cheerless.

Which of course doesn't mean that I dislike the set or anything. In fact, I am rather pleased with the fully built model.

First off, lets take a look at the rider, Fero. A nasty Bone Hunter, Fero is your average '08 Matoran or '09 Agori, build-wise. He's awfully bland, being all black, and his dull gray hands don't do any favors for his looks either... wait, he's got the old hands, not the new ones with fingers! Why?
His helmet is a regular army-class Skrall helmet, an almost extremely elongated piece, which in my opinion looks quite ridiculous on him when viewed from the side. If his mount Skirmix is a raptor, then he is a midget anthropomorphised Parasaurolophus. His close-combat weapon is also a Skrall-styled blade, with a lime green center-part, the one you can find on Tuma's back. I would have preferred a more unique piece, or at least a different colored one. Its green part stands out from the overall color-scheme of the set. The only other similarly colored parts on the set are Skirmix's eyes, though if you purchased the yellow-eyed variant, then his blade is the only one. His other weapon is of course the well-known Thornax launcher. One of my favorite launchers, so I don't have a problem with him having one.

Now off to the main part of the set, the frightening but still cute Rock Steed, named Skirmix. What a creature. As I have mentioned, he is basically a raptor, definitely based on some kind of Theropod dinosaur. His general build, with his huge back legs and tiny front limbs certainly make him look like one. He even has what look like feathers on the back of his head!
Building him takes no special skill, it is a quite straightforward process, during which you put all kinds of armor pieces on a longish beam, add limbs, a head and a tail, and viola!, he is finished.
Not the most interesting build, but you can't argue with the results... or can you? Overall I am fond of his looks, however there are a couple of aspects I don't like about him. His tail is surprisingly short, for one, makes you wonder how he manages to balance himself. It apparently has a venomous stinger on the tip, though I doubt he would ever resort to using this scrawny little gadget when he has his teeth-filled jaws on the front.
I like his head. It is pretty much a toothless version of the Fenrakk spider/Kardas dragon head with a different lower jaw. Did I say teeth-filled in the other paragraph? Let me rephrase it: he has razor-blades in his beak. And a gaping hole between the two sides of his jaw. I wonder how he eats...
But I still like it. The head just screams ""carnivorous dinosaur"", and the jaw can open a full 90 degrees.
The way his neck is built, though, leaves another gaping hole between his shoulders and his head. The two connector pieces let him look up and down, and his head can tilt to either side. I haven't experienced this problem yet, although I have heard this joint may loosen after a while.

He has two unmovable claws on either hands, and a permanently bent elbow. His entire arm consists of only two pieces, which I don't mind. The legs are your typical Titan legs, though a pair of nasty looking claws have been added to his ankles. The double-jointed connection to his torso unfortunately only allows his legs to move forward a little bit, whereas they swing backwards just fine. This way, he can rear up to look like the old outdated dinosaur reconstructions of the last century, but I don't think the look suits him well. He looks just gorgeous when standing horizontal, but again, his legs cannot move forward from their standard standing position. Not at all dinosaurish, in this regard.
Another thing I don't like is the lack of armor on his thighs. They look really bland and unfinished.

Al in all (for banality's sake), I'll give this set 4 out of 5 stars. I like it, but all the negative aspects together keep it from reaching 5 stars. Not a bad set, though, and I recommend getting it.

Now for our pro and contra list:

Pros:
* two characters in one set
* Skirmix looks neat
* quite poseable too, bar a few spots
* has some nice re-colored parts, mostly in dark red
* I like the way Skirmix's jaw moves, even if it's just made of one piece
* I like dinosaurs too, and he looks like one
* the set is fun to play with. Who doesn't like an evil thief riding a ""trusty"" dinosaur-like steed, raiding caravans in the desert and in the canyons, leading a troop of other similar thieves?
* there is a yellow-eyed version of this set, and yellow eyes are highly praised by some MOCists
* everything else that isn't mentioned in the con list below

Cons:
* limited poseability in places
* Fero is dull with a capital D
* he has no actual hands
* Skirmix's tail is waaay too short
* his silver feet stand out on his otherwise dark red and dark gray body. Make him look like he has shoes on
* if you are into playing the shooting game, the set only has one life-counter, and is an impressive sized target to boot (ergo: if you play with this, you will possibly lose the game)
* Skirmix's awkward neck-design
* Fero can't really move while riding Skirmix, so in order to see what's in front of them, the latter has to bend down permanently
* no special or unique molds


That's all, folks! By the way, I have the regular release of the set with the lime green eyes, if anyone's interested.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-09-06T15:10:56.78Z","Fero the Boe hunter with his Rock Steed Skirmix.","Fero

Fero has the old type of hands. :( In his right hand he holds a Thornax launcher. In his left hand he has a Bone Hunter blade. He is related to the Skrall, and weres the same helmet (all though it might just be his face). He has a little axle thing on his bottom that connects to Skirmix.


Skirmix

Skirmix is like a T-Rex. He has Av-Matoran/Agori arms. He has Shadow Matoran/Zesk claw-feet fo his claw-hands/feet. His Tail is very easy to pose and has a little kife at the end. As said in the title, he is a Rock Steed.


Overall, this is a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-17T11:31:11.7Z","""Hunt's Over. You Lose""","This set is one of my favorites. Fero is one of my favorite 2009 characters story-wise, but set-wise, he has the simple Av-Matoran/Agori build, although I like staging battles with him not riding Skirmix, with Agori or Glatorian.

Skirmix however, is fun to build and has cool conjunctions of pieces put together, like the Av-Matoran torso with liftarms attached that go down to his lower torso.He also has Metru Nui Matoran limbs as leg supports and part of the head. These also have not been used since 2006 I believe, so this is a good way of getting some.

                                               Pros:
                                  Recolored Fenrakk Head.
                               Fero has a cool Skrall sword.
            Thornax Launcher can fire far if you squeeze in the right place.
                              Cool conjunctions of pieces.
                                   Skirmix is fun to pose.

                                               Cons:
               Fero has the Av-Matoran design, but I don't care much.

A great set to play around with. Get this if you can find it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vexorian","2010-01-24T09:40:44.45Z","Those neglected arms","Well, it is really two sets in one, for better of worse.

Fero
-----
* This was my first av-matoran set and I despise the build already. I actually could build it by just looking at the pic. the parts seem to have limited applications. At the end he has limited poseability.
* Thornax launcher: These things keep getting used in 2009 sets and get old after the 3rd or 4th set you get with them, the good thing is that if you choose not to use them you end up with a lot of spare pieces.
* It is always nice to have an extra Skrall helmet.
* I think his blade's color choice could have been better, red or dark red would have combined with Skirmix.
* Overall, I see Fero as a bunch of spare parts... BTW if you do like agori you can make other agori mount Skirmix by using the same attachment that was added to Fero.

Skirmix
---------
* RAPTOR. She is as imposing as I thought
* The build is very different to what you usually see. It is like LEGO tried to use as many Av-matoran parts as possible to build her. In  this case they do work.
* ARMS! It is painful. This makes me give the set a 4 instead of a 5. It is no problem that they are small (as she is a raptor anyway) the real issue is that they use av-matoran arms and the claws are permanently attached to a joint. I think the arms have no poseability whatsoever, I plan using some old voyaran/Rahaga limbs to tweak her, hopefully I can keep the small arm looks and also have them more poseable.
* Tail is too short to be used as a weapon.
* Many complain about the silver in the feet. But I think it is a good thing. I think of the silver as if Fero added weapons to skirmix. Probably like how they add weapons to cocks for cock fights. The feet are really skirmix' only real weapon anyway. She won't be able to use the arms nor the tail. Biting seems to have limited range . 
* It is very stable. I thought that maybe she could fall out if you inclined the head to much, but no.
* Unlike the arms, the rest of the body is very poseable, and without falling off.
* I wonder if a different color scheme would have been better. Something like two tones of red instead of dark grey+ gray. Or perhaps a more exotic color like green or blue or yellow...
* What if instead of adding Fero they used all that extra plastic to make the tail longer? Or how about adding spines to the back? 

Overall a very nice set. Though I am not sure if I would buy it if I had to choose between this set and Tuma. Nevertheless, how many chances do we have to build something that is not just a humanoid?
