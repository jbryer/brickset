"TheMikeStrikesBack","2008-12-24T01:57:40.233Z","Favorite Bionicle of all time","When I first saw the Glatorian, I questioned them. I completely regret that now. I especially like this set. It has a neat black and lime green color scheme which looks really cool. The new launchers fire really well, and are really easy to launch. The spiked ball that fires is rubber, which was unexpected. I guess to make it safer. His armor is great and large so he is well defended. I also really think the new hand grips were a good idea, they make it look so much more realistic, like he's actually holding his weapons. The swords in the back really add to his overall look, making him even more menacing. And he has possibly the coolest mask I have ever seen, with two sharp edges on the side. I love how the legs are attached by two joints, this keeps him up so he doesn't always fall forward or backward. Everything is sturdy on this set, nothing falls apart easily. His head is attached by a neck too, so he has a lot of movement there. The shoulder armor is really neat too. The build is fun and enjoyable, should take 20-40 minutes. Also a reasonable price too, 20 bucks for a 188 piece set. The only thing I didn't like about this set was the fact that there are stickers on the mask. Yes that's right. Stickers on a bionicle. But it's a small price to pay for this awesome set! I highly recommend picking it up next time you see it. You won't regret it! Seriously!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"phazonix","2008-12-28T16:05:36.873Z","Tuma Storms into a store near you, is he worth it?","The answer is YES. Tuma is a great glatorian. What i really enjoy and dislike about him is :he is just a taller, more complex glatorian. I like it because he looks slim and slick. i dislike him because i think he needs just a little more bulkiness to him. When you finish the relativley easy build (took me about 20 min.) You are left with a pretty powerful looking adversary to your other glatorian (unless you have fero and skirmix). To me, though, Tuma looks a little incomplete, due to the loose ends of axels and the other such, but it's nothing unusual. Tuma also has two life counters (as opposed to the normal one on all of the others) making him much harder to kill (For The bionicle action game)
   Tuma's weapon is a little short of great, though, i mean it's cool, but it could be cooler. I really enjoy the new thornax launcher, it's versatile, and looks really cool. The launcher is composed of two pieces, which connect onto the new hand piece (Which are really cool). The Thornax is just a spikey Zamor sphere, and you only get one, so be careful not to lose it!  And the distance rivals the zamor as well. one main con about Tuma is he has.................STICKERS. The stickers go on the top and sides of Tuma's head, So it wasn't too bad, and TLG couldn't get the same detail printed on the mask. 
The Arms and legs also have the Takanuva double-jointed method, which limits poseability, but strengthens him so he won't fall over. Now for the Pros and Cons of TUMA
Pros
.19.99 for 188 Pieces
.Slim
.double jointed legs and arms
.cool mask
.Two life counters
.Bionicle action game
.wing-like things on his back
.thornax launcher fires really far
.cool new pieces
 Cons.
.Stickers
.Loose ends
.Stickers
.Bionicle action figure game
.only one thornax
     Well, Overall, i think the pros  outdo the cons. I hope this review gave you a educational-istic-ish view on whether or not tuma is worth your time",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Vrahno","2009-07-28T11:59:48.047Z","Better than I thought","I picked up this set not too long ago (duh, it was released recently). I didn't like the price that that was stuck to it, I thought the set wasn't worthy of that price, but since I couldn't find it anywhere else, I got it.

Te end-result was a delightful surprise. He's much bigger that I anticipated, and his black and gray colored pieces blend much better too.
The blades on his back (I have no idea why he has them) do a nice job at giving him more bulk, and from the front, they cover the gap between his torso and ""scapula"".
His combination of colors is not at all a new scheme, but it looks good on him. True, his chest could use some lime green parts, in my opinion.

One might think his long neck would make him look awkward, but tilting his head forward, this neck adds a lot to his looks. This posture suits him real well.

The helmet, made of soft, almost rubbery plastic gives him a personality, makes him seem old, grumpy, unreliable, troubled, just like it should. It's an asymmetrical piece actually, with the three points on his chin tilting slightly to the right. Stickers have to be applied, which could cause problems for some, but I placed them on with ease. I think they make the helmet look a lot better with their lime green lines, and I assume it would have been hard to paint them on, which is why they went with stickers instead.

His weapon is simplistic; it is composed of two recolored pieces (a black Brutaka sword and a lime green 2007-styled Matoran blade). It is rude and crude, fits the character well. His launcher is of course a Thornax fruit ""gun"". It fires well, the ammo stays in place most of the time, but most of all, it does not take away from his design, doesn't distract one's attention.

And above all, the two pieces on his ""butt"" make his waist look satisfyingly thick, muscled. And they prevent his legs from swinging backwards.


Tuma is, without doubt, one of the most traditionally, almost boringly built sets of 2009, but the fact that he is basically the ""big bad"" character of this year's story (and the only true titan of the year's first half) makes him a compulsory buy. If you don't think so, wait until he's on clearance. Trust me when I say that photos make the toy look worse than it really is.
So was he worth the money? If the earlier titans were, then Tuma certainly is as well. Still, I rate him only 4/5. He is not bad, not at all, and I like him much more than I thought I would, but I wouldn't call him radical or ground-breaking in any way, especially compared to more impressive titans, like '08 Takanuva or Brutaka -- they make him look average.


Now for the pro-con list, as it seems to be a popular way to compile one's thoughts:

Pros:
* Main bad guy, if you follow the story
* Has a nice size
* MOCers can find a handful of useful pieces on him
* I like his colors
* Fitting helmet design
* The Thornax is a small and elegant launcher
* Has a bunch of new or recolored parts
* Poseable and quite stable if posed well
* He actually has a back that is not flat, and you can position his back-blades in a number of ways

Cons:
* Unoriginal build
* His movements are limited in places due to his hinges having more than one connection points
* You may not like how his gray pieces mesh with the black ones
* Has holes on his body, which you can see from certain angles
* Stickers",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"kevyexcelsior","2009-01-13T17:18:30.81Z","Tuma, One of the Best Titans"," I bought this set a few days ago for my collection and I must say that out of my 112 bionicles this is one of the best. I knew it would be good but this set is  Excellent... Much better then I expected. It is WELL worth the price and I highly recommend it. I have most of the Titans Bionicle has made, Makuta, Mauka and Kane Ra (if you count that as a titan), Mutran and vican, Axonn, Brutaka, Vexon and Fenrakk, Keetongu, Sidorak, Roodaka, Krekka, Nidiki, Toa Ignika, Nocturn, Maxilos and Spinax, and some others, but Tuma is one of my favorites. I really like this Bionicle... Ok now the pros and cons

   Pros:
         Very Sturdy! (I like the double connected legs)
         Looks Great, he is one of the Bionicles that looks powerfull
         Like the shooter,
         Love the Mask
         New parts
         Pretty good Price

         like the hands! I really like them! they make him look more realistic
         Nice sword
   Cons:

"Carl","2009-10-15T00:23:59.53Z","Green?","I thought that when I read somewhere that this guy was the leader of the Skrall that somebody had gotten their facts wrong. Because, obviously, the Skrall are black and red and Tuma is black and green. So that's kind of a minus point. But the minus point became invisible as I built him.

Tuma is really fun to build and his mask is AWESOME! Whats not awesome however is the stickers that go on his mask. But he still looks cool enough without the stickers, so thats not too bad. His sword is great and is a really good way of using the Mahri Matoran blade and a black Lhikan sword. The Thornax Launchers looks kinda out of place on such a big guy but it is really cool anyway and fires consistently. The use of Mantax feet as shoulder armour is great and even though some people say that the rest of his arms are small in comparison to his shoulders I disagree. Though the amount of instruction manual pages spent on the arms compared to the legs is kinda tiny. Still greatly awesome however.

Now onto the legs. The top leg armour is awesome, using the Gresh feet as the armour, which some people might think sounds weird but is actually very cool. The suspension system seems to have become a recurring thing for Titans, and I personally really like it. Tuma's feet may be one of his coolest parts. The use of the Mahri Matoran blades as toes/talons/claws/feet things is really cool and looks good in green. The use of the super old Toa feet is the foot centre is also rather cool and I like seeing it in black as none of the super old Toa, including Onua who happened to be black himself, actually had that specific piece in black.

Tuma's back is really cool with the four Skrall blades sticking out in sort of an X. Sometimes I play with him and act like he lost his sword and Thornax launcher and uses the Skrall blades as weapons. The centre bit of the Skrall blades, which is red on Skrall and glow in the dark for Attakus, are green which is also very cool.Tuma is also unique as he has two life counters. Extra destruction! The unique use of a Piraka foot as a chest plate is awesome and it looks the part too.

Lego's use of old pieces for new things makes Tuma an extremely unique Bionicle, and I would highly recommend him to all Bionicle fans. And even though he is black and green, as opposed to black and red, Tuma is still awesome. A MUST HAVE!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"trewerd","2009-10-04T23:56:44.967Z","Worth Your Money Big Time","I went in the store looking to buy Toa Mistika Takanuva, but this thing caught my eye. After a long trek home, I started building him, smiling in joy as I did. 

Pros:

-height. Tuma's tall. I mean really tall. Not as tall as Mistika Takanuva mind you, but nearly double the height of a glatorian set such as Ackar or Mata Nui.

-clever use of pieces. Everything about him just screams evil. From the Vahki-esque face, the Spiked leg pads, the serrated sword, clawed feet, and his wings.

-nice engineering/articulation. The way the joints and ligaments are attached, means that he can hold any sort of pose you can put him in. Granted, his limbs do not rotate a full 360 degrees, but that's within normal human restrictions.

Cons:

-He lacks the Skrall shield seen in the movie in favor of a Thornax launcher (the rubbery spike ball firing gimmick)

Final Verdict:

For roughly 20 dollars, he's well worth the money. He's tall, a fun build, and highly poseable. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Stronius8888","2009-11-02T23:42:01.467Z","The leader of Roxtus is ready to battle!","Tuma is one of my favourite Bionicle sets of all time. Here is my review on this fantastic Bionicle.

Pros:
-MASSIVE!
-Although red and black is a better colour scheme (I think), black and green

-Nice mask.
-Skrall blades are moveable.
-Nice use of the Brutaka sword.
-Thornax launcher is simple to use and reasonably powerful.
-Nice use of Mantax (Barraki) feet as shoulder armour.
-Tribal designs.

Cons:
-No Skrall shield (as seen in Bionicle: The Legend Reborn)
-Thornax can sometimes fall out of the launcher.
-Stickers (although they stick preety well) can be a bit fiffly to put on.
-Hinges/ Joints limit movement.

Overall, Tuma is a great Bionicle and I would recomend it to all hardcore Bionicle fans.
