Nothing new or fancy in terms of design, no appeal to the ye and some clumsy design in regards to the yeloow hoses.  Another set I am glad I made out of spare parts and did not waste buying.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"lyxzen","2007-12-09T20:57:51.293Z","Excellent Set!","I don't know, maybe I'm looking through the rose coloured glasses of my childhood, but I love this set.  I can't say exactly what I love about it, but I do love it, so much in fact that i've been replacing the broken and worn pieces, sometimes at great expense (it would probably be cheeper to just buy another one).  So please, everyone please stop bashing this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-03-16T23:35:31.78Z","Nice supply of parts, but....","Frankly I'd be happy if a good set had taken priority over trying to cram as many useful pieces as possible into it.  No real thought seems to have gone into the design of this spacecraft.  The colour co-ordination is all over the place, and once again we're asked to try twisting those wretched wires into ridiculous positions in the hope they'll stay there.  The front of the ship detaches (if you want a flying shoe-box) and there's a little robot and buggy.  This a is far cry from the usual high standards of Classic Space.

"thepeopleperson","2008-06-09T09:44:59.2Z","A Nice Classic Set!","I bought this on ebay a few years ago, and was not until recently that I discovered the value of this set ($600.00)!  Here are pros and cons.

Pros:
A very large set for being a promotional
Cockpit detaches from the body so it can be a little personal spacecraft
The lunar rover thing fits in the cargo bay at the back
Has a red classic spaceman and a blue droid/robot
Lot of trans-yellow tubes
Fast build

Cons: 
None!

This is really a great set if you have the money, and for me it's just a great example of the good 'ol day in Lego space.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-09-07T14:01:55.1Z","1968 Unnamed Set Review - Childhood Nostalgia","<p>I just recently went back through my collection and rebuilt this set. Seeing this set immediately brings me back to fond childhood memories
 of a summer I went up to see my Grandpa up in Canada. One of the first 
years we'd seen him and had found him after several years not knowing 
where to look.</p>
<p>So perhaps you can chalk it up to some extremes of nostalgia and memories tied to that era.</p>
<p>I remember having a lot of fun putting this set together and playing 
with it. I thought it was neat that the front part comes off as a little
 ship. The robot, the little buggy.</p>

<p>To me it's just a gret versatile little set. </p>
<p>Perhaps now that I'm older I can look back and say, some aspects are 
too simple... but then, lego has come out with more custom pieces, this 
set could easily look different with some of the elements available now.</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are on a folded sheet of paper, printed on either side with LEGO's clear, easy to follow step-by-step illustrations.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 193 pieces for this set. With a lot of old style, classic wings and engine pieces. Many of my yellow plastic hoses for this set have cracked over the years and no longer connect the way they once did.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get one Red Classic Space minifigure in this set.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4>You'll build this set in various stages and steps.<br><br>1st - Blue Robot - Something about this simple design for a LEGO robot has always amused me and not just because of being my favorite color.<br><br>2nd - Lunar Buggy - There's a small ground vehicle that's stored in the back of the ship that can pull out and be used by the space mini for exploring what ever planet he's on.<br><br>3rd - Mini Ship - The main ship is in two stages as the front area where the minifigure sits can detach away from the larger set and fly around on it's own.<br><br>4th - Mobile Base - This is the other half of the larger build, that with the mini garage out back for the lunar buggy, has a computer console up top and what appear to be satellite dishes on either side where the blue robot works at. Given the smaller ship can detach, this has always suggested to me that this ship can act as a mobile, lunar base for exploration.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Once upon a time, this had been the largest of any of my Space sets, regardless of the theme and due to nostalgia, it still remains one of my favorites. When I found it on Brickset and saw it was an exclusive to Germany, I realize how lucky I am to have gotten this set on a visit up to see my Grandpa in Canada. It also surprises me somewhat that this set has never had a name for it, just ""unnamed."" I just love it and it has a special place in my LEGO collection for all the fond memories with it.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"roshisan","2018-02-20T18:45:22.82Z","A whale of a set","<p>I will begin&nbsp;by saying that this was not an easy set to get my&nbsp;hands on.&nbsp;I bought a mostly complete one that somebody else&nbsp;had probably pieced together, then had to order the instructions from Germany and the rest of the pieces from BrickLink.&nbsp; Purists may&nbsp;argue that mine&nbsp;isn&#39;t really a set, but if it looks like duck...</p>

<p>I have not built it...yet.&nbsp;&quot;Why not?&quot;, you ask.&nbsp;Since parts inventories are readily available, I am content to collect for now until I&nbsp;have all of the Classic Space series.&nbsp;Each set&nbsp;I stash away is a brand new building experience that I ruin if I build them as soon as I get them.&nbsp;My wife doesn&#39;t understand,&nbsp;but she doesn&#39;t have to.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;nice knowing I will have&nbsp;bins&nbsp;full of &quot;10 years old&quot; waiting for me.</p>

<p>If the above&nbsp;makes you stop reading, so be it. All of these reviews (including mine) are subjective and apparently in this day and age it is perfectly acceptable, even encouraged, to weigh in on things you don&#39;t&nbsp;know about or haven&#39;t done.&nbsp;I believe I will, thank you very much.&nbsp;I admit, that I am biased toward the 1968&nbsp;because of its exotic nature; specifically that it wasn&#39;t available in the U.S.&nbsp;I have drooled over the pictures of it because foreign sets are hot!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why the 1968&nbsp;was not worthy of a name or of being marketed world-wide.&nbsp;Some say it was called &quot;Space Express&quot;, which is dumb, but &quot;Unnamed Set&quot; is even dumber, although not as bad as &quot;Supermodel Building Instructions&quot; for the 1593, a name which left me expecting to build Elle Macpherson out of Lego. Regardless, had the 1968 been available stateside, I guarantee that I would have bought it, Christmas colors aside, which seem odd for a Classic Space old gray/grey (which one is the proper spelling?) and green color scheme.</p>

<p>It is tempting to put a Christmas tree in between the big black wedge pieces during the holidays though...</p>

<p>The ship is appealing, but would be much more so if I were a colorblind humpback whale. I&#39;m counting on it looking good sitting next to the Gamma-V Lasercraft&nbsp;and Lunar Scout (and also the Solar Power Transporter and Alien Moonstalker, once I get them) because if it doesn&#39;t, that shoots some gaping holes in my plans for a Classic Space base.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait to show this set off to all my non-Lego nerd friends. Even if they don&#39;t get it, the 1968&nbsp;promises to be the jewel of my collection, along with the 1593 (hotter), that straight-winged alternate build of the 1593 (smokin&#39; hot) , and the Robot Command Center, which&nbsp;I don&#39;t really like, but is still weird and ugly, so I guess I actually kind of like it (warm?).</p>

"Almabeach","2019-02-14T22:49:44.677Z","Still fun to play after 30+ years","<p>One of the firsts sets I got as a kid. I still have most of the parts even though those annoying yellow pipes don&rsquo;t stay in place or are broken. This is a classic set for me nonetheless.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not the most beautiful of the space series as there is a lot of gray but the overall fun of the set makes it worth building again and again after all those years.</p>

<p>The best aspect of the set is the playability. You can separate the main cockpit from the rest of the ship and make it fly around while your little robot buddy go on an exploration on his own with the little 4 wheeler buggy thing. Or&nbsp;he can stay in the ship and analyse the terrain with all his computer gadgets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also love the back exit&nbsp;to store the 4 wheeler and the robot is really cute too.</p>
