When opening the box you might even think there is a bag missing with some larger beams.
Even without the stickers it looks great.
The biggest downside i found is the fact that the engine is connected to the rear suspension. With an engine this size the ride on a real quad with this configuration might be a bit rough size the sprung weight very high.
Also the turning radius is horrible because the steering doesn't go far.

pros:
* Nice build, besides the fenders and wheels there are no large parts which makes for a pretty long buildtime for a set of this price
* Cool looks, this thing just looks awesome.
* Nice functions, moving engine, suspension in the rear and even independant suspension with steering in the front.

cons:
* no universal joint and differential in the drivetrain.
* wide turning radius.
* high US price, 40usd vs 30eur",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Since it is made out of small and little pieces, the profile on the tires, makes this model wobble a lot. Anyway, next to that, if you fool around a bit, you can also make a trike from the main model... Just rebuild the back a bit.
The B-model is nice, but a bit strange with the controls at the back, but hey: its something different.
My advise: if you want to buy something Technic, buy another set, or save a bit more to buy a somewhat bigger one, but it is not bad...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Here is the closing for the review:

Features
Both vehicles uses the shocks, but the Quad-Bike uses 3. One for the back, and two for the front. The Dune Buggy uses shocks just on the back. The front wheels turn on the Quad-Bike, but the rear wheels turn on the Dune Buggy. Both sets uses a 2 cycle engine, which does cycle the pistons as you push the vehicles around. 

Final thoughts
Both sets are good build. They are much smaller than you would think. I was surprised at the size. The box pictures make it seem much larger vehicle than it really is. One thing. This set has many small technic parts. It was a pain to dismantle. This is one of those sets you need to have a solid flat surface that you can use to help you push some parts together. The sets does use stickers to bring out the feel of the sets. Since I didn't use the stickers, it seemed a bit bland. But that's my fault for not pasting the stickers.

My rating:

Playability: 4 out of 5. It is playable. Rolls, and moves and I like things with shocks. 
Design: 3 out of 5. This is not a complicated set. It has enough parts to make it look like what it's supposed to be. But nothing more. I like the buggy, but if you notice, there's no chair or steering wheel, etc. But from the outside, it does look nice. 
Build experience: 3 out of 5. For a technic set, it doesn't have allot of complicated parts to put together. Although, I found it hard to put some pieces together that were small. I must be getting old.
Overall: 3 out of 5. At 308 pieces, and paying close to $45 for it, it was a bit much. But the set to me did come out nice. This is one of those, ""want"" sets. Not a ""must have"" set.

I didn't put the stickers on cos if i ever build the dune buggy i don't want it saying ""QUAD BIKE"" on the front and rear bumpers. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Mandalorian","2010-10-25T13:49:58.943Z","Cool Quad-Bike","I got this set a couple of months ago, and I gotta say it's quite cool. The suspension is great, the steering system is okay and the V2 engine works (of course). The build isn't too chalenging or long, but some of the pieces you get are great, such as the big wheels or plates. It isn't too expensive, but it's not cheap by any means.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Independent front suspension and normal suspension in the back</li><li>Working V2 engine (obvious)</li><li>Great pieces</li><li>Good build, especially for begginers</li><li>Affordable price</li><li>Looks cool<br></li></ul>Cons:<br><ul><li>Still, not cheap</li></ul><br>If you have the money to buy it, do so.
