Cependant, l'esthétique et la jouabilité sont bien présentes, et ce sur les deux modèles possibles.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

The 144 parts gives great, and real easy buildingfun and total playability for builders of any age.

Great model at a good price, so it's a perfect gift!

"Duq","2010-03-02T03:52:08.98Z","Disappointing","<p>It is slightly bigger than its predecessor 8219 and I'm not sure that's a good thing. Especially at the back it looks too big and empty for the size of the wheels.</p>
<p>It's interesting to see steering without the traditional rack and pinion but unfortunately it's not working properly; the steering range is limited. You can't get the wheels to the angle you see in the picture above because the mechanism jams. The result is a turning circle of half a mile...</p>
<p>This Technic sets only does two things; it steers and it moves the piston, and it does one of them badly. For the &euro;16,99 I paid for it I really can't recommend this set.</p>",TRUE,2,3,3,2,2

Gokart bardzo ladnie i realistycznie wyglada. Duzym plusem tego zestawu jest atrapa silnika z ruchomym tlokiem. Polecam!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Capitán_Skrall","2010-10-17T21:00:24.05Z","A good looking set with some flaws","This is my first review on brickset, so here we go!<div><br></div><div>First, I did´t expect this one because it was a present actually, I was definitely excited about it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It comes with 144 pieces, this amount is divided in lots of liftarms and pins, some flexible axles (4), those wheels from the power racers and only two gears. Unless you´re interested in the lime green panels or in the wheels, theres nothing really exciting in the inventory. It also includes some stickers, wich are nice but I didn´t apply.</div><div><br></div><div>This set offers two different models, the main one is a go kart and for the alternate we get a riding lawn mower. The build of the main one is really simple for a technic set, and the most interesting part of it, is how they managed the steering system. A different system that doesn´t use the rack and pinion, it´s a smooth mechanisim but with has an horrible turning ratio. Then is the one piston motor, with a couple of gears for its working. Overall it looks just like a real one.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Then, we have the riding lawn mower. The build almost uses all the pieces, the remainig ones are the ones for the motor and a few pins. This model uses the same steering system, and thats it. It may sound lame, but I actually enjoyed more this one, it´s more fun to build, the design is really nice (I love the front of it), and I played even more with this model. It looks better than the go kart and it has some nice details like the pipes on the left side of it.</div><div><br></div><div>Now for the pros and cons.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div>-Its a good looking model overall, specially the lawn mower.</div><div>-Has all the functions of a real one.</div><div>-The price its OK (but I paid the equivalent to 30 US$ here in Paraguay).</div><div>-Some nice pieces, but nothing exciting.</div><div>-This is the first represantation of a lawn mower in the Technic line</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div>-Lame turning ratio.</div><div>-Really simple mechanisms.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>So, I think a 3,5/5 its fair for this one. &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"Mandalorian","2010-10-25T11:03:47.2Z","Cool little Go-Kart","Reading other reviews, I have noticed several complaints about this set. To me however, this is a very cool, however small set. There's a moving piston, a new kind of steering mechanism, which does not use a single gear and nothing else. However for such a small price, two simple mechanisms is okay. Too bad there aren't that many pieces and the build is rather simple, but still, it's a nice set.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>two functions</li><li>great price</li><li>looks nice, cute</li></ul>Cons:<br><ul><li>only two gears</li><li>not many pieces</li><li>simple build</li></ul><br>If you have the chance to get it, I don't see why not do so.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-25T08:45:26.69Z","LEGO Technic - Go-Kart Review","This is a very cool set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build of this model is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on. This vehicle is very easy to maneuver as well. The steering wheel makes the tyres on the front moving to the left or to the right. We also get a sviwel seat and if you move the kart the yellow piston in the inside of the engine is moving up and down. I also like the color which LEGO has chosen for this vehicle. I really can't complain much about this set. As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
