I really like the green pieces.  The bucket arm goes up and down by turning a piece in the back of the tractor.  The front wheels do not turn left or right.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Please check my brickshelf (trough my profile) to view some pics i made.

After all this give so much value for money. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
