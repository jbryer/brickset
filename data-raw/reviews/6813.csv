It is fairly quick and easy to put togather and looks quite realistic for a monster type truck with the oversize wheels.  The only real downside is the price, at &#163;18.50 from lego shop in mk, uk it is a little pricy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Nice small set and if you're familiar building Lego Technic, its put together in 15 minutes (bot A and B-models). Nice model and especially if you have some filting equipment that can not handle really heavy stuf, this one is light enough to lift. Finally I had some spare spring now ;) since this model has a bit of everthing in it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<br />
This set has quite a few features:
<ul>
    <li>Tilting front suspension.</li>
    <li>Front steering.</li>
    <li>&quot;Bouncing&quot; suspension at the rear.</li>
    <li>Tiltable chairs. :)</li>
    <li>And changeable steering wheel position. :)</li>
</ul>
This has good playability: You can make the truck bounce, and make the front suspension tilt on an object. It's a joy to make it tilt, but the suspension is a little bit too stiff to make it bounce on little hills. Now, onto the pros and cons:
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Tilting front suspension.</li>
    <li>Front steering.</li>
    <li>&quot;Bouncing&quot; suspension at the rear.</li>
    <li>Tiltable chairs.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Changeable steering wheel position.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Suspension is liiiittle bit stiff.</li>
</ul>
Overall, a very playable set! Hey, my first review in Brickset's &quot;HTML editor&quot; thingy! :)<br type=""_moz"" />",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"wrathofgod22","2009-11-27T04:16:34.153Z","Nice and Cute Set","Just bought this set few days ago for 30 SGD after 25% discount at Toys R Us. It's my first small Technic set, so there's not much functions in it but it's nice and fun to play with.

Pros:
-Nice and cute look
-Huge wheels
-Front steering, tilting front wheels and rear suspension

Cons:
-Too pricy

Now I'm hoping to get 8262 Quad Bike if there's a sale for it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>Based on the small amount of parts, I did not expect the monster truck to be that big or detailed, but it&#39;s actually a very nice-looking and sturdy model.</p>

<p>The B-model was a disappointment as it was neither good looking or very clever. It really felt like an afterthought, even more so than other B-models.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this set is fine for what it is, but nothing spectacular.</p>
