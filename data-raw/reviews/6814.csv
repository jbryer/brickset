This was my 1st Technic Set in about 20 years, and the 1st motorized one I ever built.  It is very sturdy for the kids to play with, and the motorized dumping action is very nice.  I guess if I had to pick a flaw or two, I would say I was used to Technic sets with more gears and more options for control.  On this set, you steer manually, and dump with the motor.  The dumping action is via a motor that connects to an arm that looks like one of the pneumatic actuators.  I assume there is a worm gear in the arm that translates the rotation of the motor to linear actuation.  It's pretty neat.  I would have paid more for another motor for the drive train, but for $69 this is a great set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The instructions are downloaded from lego in 4 pdf files.

The set is new style ie completely studless construction. The set uses the new size axles in grey 7stud, 5stud, 3stud.

I like the steering mechanism and the wheels are good sized lorry wheels.
I also like the new flat panels.

The flat bed is moved by a linear actuator connected to a power functions m motor. I like the movement but it could do with a clutch gear to stop the motor stressing the linear actuator when it has reached its full reciporocation.

Took me 90 mins to build.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

At AU$115 it isn't cheap for 575 pieces, probably because of the motor.<br><br>Building took under 2 hours, it was easy and straight forward. The model comes in four main bags, which are assembled and connected.<br><br>The models primary function of tipping the tray works very well, and it is quick and easy. However, if you do not turn the motor off in time, it causes the linear actuator's internal clutch to slip, making a horrible grinding noise. The only other decent function is the steering, which works well as long as the model is moving.<br>There is independent suspension for the rear wheels, and it works fairly well.<br>The bonnet also can be manually raised to reveal the 'engine', which consists of two ugly bionicle pieces. I assume they are supposed to look like something that would be found on a real engine.....<br><br>Visually, the model looks good and has some nice details. Examples would be the mirrors, dashboard and front bumper.<br><br>Pros:<br>Contains a motor!<br>Another linear actuator (LEGO are really pushing these!)<br>Good tipping function<br>Nice wheels<br>Proper gears for the steering (nothing like the steering system on the telescopic handler!)<br>New large plate pieces <br><br>Cons:<br>Price<br>Bionicle engine<br>Needs a better clutch<br>A technic set without gears? Almost!",TRUE,3,3,4,3,2

Looking forward to buying the 8109 flatbed. Looks more like the real thing. I drive it daily :)<br><br>Easy to build, and works great. Like it that the bed and stoppers goes down simultaniously<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,3
