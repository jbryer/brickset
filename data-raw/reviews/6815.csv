"vgo","2009-06-19T02:51:51.543Z","Poor steering mechanism","I thought this set would be neat, easy to build RC cars with different bodies. The chassis system is so simple that it's brilliant, the chassis is held by one tile with a pin on it. The chassis moves around a bit, but doesn't come off too easily.

All was well until I tested the truck for the first time, all actions are pretty just on/off, the car either moves at full speed either forward or backward and turns to the left or right. 

The cars have serious problems going straight, the wheels wobble a lot, the steering mechanism is too weak to hold the wheels steady. The off-road truck lacks proper ground clearance, which can be fixed with bigger wheels, but then the steering is even worse and the motor lacks the power to move the car. 

The cars can get ""stuck"" if you are stationary, then try to turn and reverse at the same time, nothing happens, you need to first reverse and then turn.

Overall a big disappointment. If you're looking for a RC car for your kid, buy a real RC car kit instead.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

Easy to build and fun to drive.
I was surprised about the high speed it had. 

The two diffrent chassis was a nice touch too. The color scheme is good on both of them. But I personaly like thre red and white truck best.

There is two bad things about this set:
1. The chassis sit very loose on top of the body. It could hav been connected somewhere with a stud or two but still made it easy to swap the chassis.

2. The steering is a bit weak. When it hit a bump or on a carpet it goes everwhere. The car goes best on flat surfaces.

It is a good thing that they did not made a new type of transmitter, this way it could be controlled by other transmitters like the MS1046-1: Infrared Link Sensor connected to a NXT.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Duq","2010-03-14T20:49:00.623Z","Two great Rally cars in one set","This set and it's cousin <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8183-1"">8183</a> are the easiest way to make remote control Power Functions car. Like with most cheap remote controlled cars the controls are digital; full speed forward or reverse, and full lock steering left or right.<br><br>The build is fairly straight forward with hardly any SNOT. I built the truck while my 8-year old son built the green car and we had no trouble at all. There's a nice bunch of parts including the red 9-spoke hubcaps that are unique to this set.<br><br>Stickers are essential for that race-car look and this set comes with quite a sheet of them. LEGO seems to have listened to complaints and none of the stickers go on more than one piece so you can take the car apart without ruining the stickers.<br>Which is just as well because the instruction booklet contains instructions for 4 models; 2 with red and white parts and 2 with the green parts.<br><br>The idea of fixing the bodies to the chassis with a single pin is clever. Unfortunately the tile with the pin has a little rim around the base of the pin. As a result the body is lifted up a fraction which causes the bodies to wobble a bit. Not a big problem though and it certainly doesn't affect playability.<br><br>This set is so much more fun than any remote control car you can buy in the shop, simply because it's Lego! <br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Bapao","2010-04-13T12:35:43.513Z","Needs oil!!","<p>I actually sent a rant mail to Lego about this set because I was experiencing the issue that the guy above me has. It just wouldn't steer properly and struggled to move at all. I sent a really long mail with the exact desciption of the issue and got a mail back saying that ""Lego Racers is not compatible with VISTA"", so basically they didn't even read my mail :o(</p>
<p>But anyway, whilst I was waiting for a reply I noticed that the wheels where pretty tight so I sprayed some WD40 oil onto the axels. It was pretty messy but the difference is HUGE. The car actually&nbsp;runs well now; it gets up to speed well, turns well in both directions and even runs with the heavy chassis and the big wheels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if yours has the above issue, try oiling the axels ;o)</p>
<p>Othewise it's a nice kit but a bit too expensive. You can get a pretty good RC car for the price of this but yeah, it's Lego and I bought it so there must be a demand somewhere ;o)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yeah ""Shame on you Lego support!""....</p>
