"hustla187","2008-11-26T20:42:25.513Z","Good at the Race","IF you have seen or been to a Formula 1 or NASCAR race, you might have seen this vehicle. It is a vehicle that leads the racers along the track in case the track is slippery or a car crash. The sirens are pretty cool and it is useful on the track. Overall, this is a very good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The red face stickers are also the wrong way up when following the instructions.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"BrickFactoryINC","2021-10-26T04:45:01.15Z","Good But Interesting","<p>I have had this set for a very long time back when Racers was a thing, for the size this isn&#39;t actually half bad.&nbsp; The set defiantly doesn&#39;t fit in my collection, but I will never remove it from my collection.&nbsp; This was a very easy and quick build and very playable.&nbsp; Would only recommend it to a child or to a big Racer&#39;s fan it is just one of those things that looks good but haven&#39;t aged well</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Very mixed but very cool ad unlike&nbsp;</p>
