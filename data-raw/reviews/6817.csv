This thing has the same design as the thunder raceway cars. Well that's pretty much what a tiny turbo car does. Overall this is a great car and you should get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

(pretty rare),the wide black wheels look very agressive and also the top part of the car is very smooth!. Just one small problem with the design of the rear end ,which in my opinion is raised to far off the ground and that makes it look unrealistic,still,it can be easily fixed.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
