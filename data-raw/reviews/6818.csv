"hustla187","2009-04-10T19:32:51.31Z","Great Tiny Turbo","This Tiny Turbo reminds me of a Nissan Skyline or a Mazda RX-7. I like the design of the vehicle and Lego used the right pieces for this one, which is perfect for the Tiny Turbo. As usual, stickers are included which makes it a hassle and I recommend not putting stickers on the front bumper. This is a great set and it is a must own for Tiny Turbo fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only complaint is that there are too many stickers in this set and lego should print them on I think. </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
