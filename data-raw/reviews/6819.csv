At first I thought this was a new styled body for the TT Theme. I looked up the TT sets of years past and couldn't believe how similar this set is too the ATR 4 from 2005 (8657)! The color scheme is completely different but the body styles are eerily similar. The black car in the 8126 2 pack also looks like it was separated at birth from the ATR 4. This is making me question whether or not to buy the 8126 set now because the cars are SO ALIKE! 

This trend is one that worries me and confuses me as well. I am worried that LEGO will discontinue the line because they are running out of ideas and I am confused as to how LEGO seems to be running out of ideas for their own product which is seemingly limitless!

There are many useful parts in this set such as several yellow slopes, the black windshield, black wheels and 2x4 brackets. These sets are usually good for smaller parts and this is true for the Desert Viper. This score was hurt by the fact that LEGO already released a set like this before!
