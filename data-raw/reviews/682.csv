It's a small set, but hits the mark with a distinctive 'bot. What's also cool is that this set came in a bonus pack with two small town sets, a small castle set, and a small pirates set. It's a good pack to pick up if you want a sampling of minifigs and models from various Lego themes.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This is a very neat set. The robot looks so high tech and the minifigure is once again great, better color scheme then space police one. But how r they gonna fight with no weapons?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
