I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.","Okay, to give this set a fair, objective review, let's cover the facts first.<br><br>1. More playability than displayability.<br>2. A Ferrari licensed product.<br>3. Stickers all over.<br><br>The pricing could be better, but is typical of a licensed product (just look at the prices of the SW sets).<br><br>Sure, there are stickers galore, but it doesn't look that bad without them. As far as stickers go, these are some great stickers for MOCs. It would have been nice to see printed flags, but I'm guessing this was a price-point compromise.<br><br>Despite not being much to the set, it is indeed full of playability, and if you own any more of these fold-up-box plates, you could put together a great micro race track.<br><br>The greatest pluses in this set, are a couple of the new 4x1 slopes in red, a pair of 3x1 slopes and a pile of 2x1 red jumper plates - each F1 racer is practically covered in them (14 in total!) - and who couldn't use more red cheese slopes, there are 12 in this set, plus 1 extra.<br><br>Overall, it's a fun set let down by the price and sticker overload. Ferrari fans, save your money and pick up one of the other licensed sets (especially 8168 or 8157), and parts hoarders, I'd suggest picking this one up on discount.",TRUE,3,4,3,4,2

I like the way how LEGO did the details of those two cars. The built is fun and easy. The bags of this model are numbered and we also get a few stickers which you have to put on. I also like the way how this street plate will fold up if you take the flags, the signs and the gate with the 'PIT LANE' sign apart. I think it's a good set to have but I think the street plate is a little bit too small for two cars if you want the cars to overtake each other. The whole scene and the two vehicles are very sturdy as well.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
