Everything (minifig torsos, flags, and all car parts) has stickers. The only thing that is actually printed is the driver's helmets.

Another con: The two drivers are skin-toned and the other guy is yellow - so they don't even match!!

This will be the last set I buy without checking that the minifig torsos are painted on.

If I could, I would take this set back, but I've already opened it. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

The minifigures are ok, I don't mind a sticker here or there, and I already have too many drivers anyway...weird that the drivers are flesh and the flagman is yellow. I by these sets for the cars so I don't really care. The car differs mainly from the previous F1 cars due to the longer wheel base, black wheels, and revised engine cover and sidepods. The sponsor stickers are also new for the 2008 car. All-in-all it looks great next to the 'older' versions and I enjoy watching the cars progress every year. Here's hoping for a 2009 car.

"Iltbrand","2009-10-16T16:57:45.03Z","Nice set","I got this set on sale - otherwise I might think it's a bit overprized. I am astonished by the grade of details. These cars are huge! Actually some of the only vehicles that really matches the minifigsize, if we go all realistic. And they look great, are funny build, with some nice SNOT-techniques.
46 stickers is an awfull lot, and some of them are VERY small. But then again, the cars looks kinda naked without them, and none of the stickers fills more than one brick. Even though I would have liked if at least the minifigs were printed...

All in all a great set - Ferraris always look great! I will go shopping for #8185 first thing tomorrow!

I'm looking forward to the Fernando Alonso-sets next season

Ps. This is my first review - problably not the best one you'ver read - but we all gotta start somewhere...;-)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legomakes3","2009-07-03T17:27:37.92Z","A Nice Set!","After given the privilage to buy a Lego set today at a local toystore, I decided to get my 1st Racers set. Now, as a beloved LEGO Pirates fan and a fan of the regular, original bricks, I didn't know for sure if this set would suit me. But after the 20-mintue build, and the 10 minute play time, I knew that the Racers Ferrari series is good for me, too. (Just Ferrari, not the modern Racer stuff. I really like historical sets based off of real events!)

Now, from the building time and the play time, here is my pros and cons list for the set:

Pros-

*Very detailed
*Accurate!
*Fun to play with
*3 mini-figures: 2 very famous Ferrari race-car drivers and 1 finish line flag-man
*Zips by as fast as lightning
*Very easy build

Cons-

*Flag-man is yellow colored and drivers are tan colored? I don't know how this could of happened, but maybe TLG rushed out production of this set, and didn't have a chance to fix this orginial sketch mistake! The flag-man doesn't look as ""real"" as the race car drivers, he looks too Legolandish!
*This set would probably win an award for the ""Most Stickers""! It was very hard to put the stickers on!
*The mini-figures should of had printed torsos! The most un-nessacery con was that the flag man didn't have a printed body! How many suit torsos are there in the Lego factory? About 500,000,000!

Although the cons affect the set in some ways, and in play time, this set is not number 1 on my list, but this set will still be one of my favs, for all the pros it has going for it!
