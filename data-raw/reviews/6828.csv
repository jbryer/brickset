"schmendrick","2009-06-25T02:56:27.997Z","You'll never walk alone","Okay, Grandma arrived with this little present for our son. First I was a little bit confused about the color of the tiger cub. The orange looks very dark, because there are no white areas on the body (except the mouth). But my son recognized it as a ""ti'er"" and so henceforth it shall be called tiger. On the other hand we have one of the rare female figures. Stuck in time, Duplo? Anyway, my son has great fun with this little set. The flower was feeded instantly to the shark, the woman drives the fire truck - only THIS woman. And the little tiger cub is sitting on the helicopters rear seat, making more dangerous ROARRR-sounds than the T-Rex in Jurassic Park.
