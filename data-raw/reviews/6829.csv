<p>It has a Zookeeper, a big polar bear, a small polar bear, two penguins, and a fish.&nbsp; It also has a slide for the animals (or people) and some fence pieces.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There is a slope brick with a printing of a polar bear and a map of Greenland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having only one figure makes the set a little lonely, with only animals to keep company with the poor </p>
<p>Zookeeper lady.&nbsp; It would be nice to have a visitor or two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The slide is probably the funniest part of the set, but it tends to pop apart or come unmounted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set doesn't measure up with some of the better Duplo sets in parts or playability or even price.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It's not bad, but there are better sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
