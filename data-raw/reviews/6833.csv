My son instead was completely over the moon when he saw the motorbike and... the post box. It was only a question of time when he noticed, that by removing the blue part, he was able to put bigger things through the opening. For example the postman. Harhar. Strike. Ok, seriously - he really loves this set and the post box must be placed in EVERY building. Without post box - no interest.

Bright side of the moon:
+ Cool chopper-like bike with wide tires (it won't tip over too easily)
+ Clever designed post box
+ The package brick

Dark side of the moon:
- nothing

That being said, as a collector there are a couple of thing that I am upset with. Firstly the door to the mailbox does not stay closed it is always slightly ajar. The door frame itself is missing the piece that holds the door closed. Secondly the letter or parcel does not attach firmly to the back of the motor cycle, it is easily knocked off. It is beyond my understanding that 2 such mistakes could be made in a set that only contains 9 pieces.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
