"kaboomlegoman","2009-04-19T21:09:55.733Z","well designed.","I must say that this set is very great. It's really cool that the ladder can move up and down,considering that the only flaw is the ladder when parking inside the station. The ideas are pretty cool,and overall,this is a good set that you should consider getting.

"meyerc13","2009-11-17T00:08:28.373Z","Great little starter set","This is one of the first sets my 4 year old received, and it is a great starter set.  You get enough bricks to build the fire truck and building pictured above, plus there are ideas for another truck and a boat.

The truck even has doors, which seem to be fairly rare on most of the vehicles being released by LEGO now.

The building is fairly simple, but if you have a brick bucket you can use your extra bricks to expand the building.  It's nice that they've included a window and door, although they are two deep which detracts from the set a bit.

Overall this is a nice little set, and I wish they had other sets like this in the City line.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legogirl324","2010-02-09T02:46:35.5Z","Great for kids!","My 3-yr old son got this as a gift. He plays with it under minimal adult supervision.
Pros:
-High playability - has both the concept of a house and a vehicle - which fosters imagination
-number of pcs is just right for his age - not too few, not too many so as to lose some
Cons:
-only 2 sets of instructions; could be 3 based on the images in the box ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
