It's like  a mini-creator set that allows your imagination to take over.  The main reason I purchased this set from a TRU in Los Angeles was for the minifig, that unless I'm mistaken is exclusive to this set.  The Torso is amazing, great detail!  It's a great step up from the first pirates (although those weren't bad).  The boat doesn't exactly fit in with any of the other pirates sets, but it's not supposed to.  The shark is just what lego sharks should look like.  I might replace my old dark gray sharks with a school of these funny blue sharks.  So if you're prepared to shell out 10 bucks for an awesome minifig and some spare parts, this is the set for you!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lotographia","2009-02-11T04:15:15.233Z","I just paid $19.99 for a minifig...","But that was in New Zealand currency so it's not as bad as it sounds. This set gets a bonus for having the unique minifig head and torso, but loses it again because the Lego company very obviously set it up this way so pirate collectors would purchase this set they wouldn't otherwise want. Who would want it if they already had the minifig pieces from other sets?

Cynicism aside, this is a cute little set with several different building instructions - something adult collectors very often forget the importance of. It wasn't long ago that they still had alternate models on the back of all lego boxes, something I miss quite a lot.

This set doesn't deserve the harsh reception it's been given, it's not even technically in the pirate range and people are comparing it with the Black Seas Barracuda. Does it really deserve less than four stars? I think it's perfectly adequate for the age range it's aimed at. I only penalise it for 'stealing' one of the better pirate torsos.

Hopefully this set will plant the 'pirate lego' seed in the minds of younger builders, giving Lego an reason to continue the range for quite some time.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sethlee","2009-03-01T15:29:29.187Z","Neat,Nice,Set","Well this little set can be fun for kids that are like ,3,4 or 5 but its actually fun for an older age. Now this is a small nice set. I know its very kiddish colorful theme, but if you are into those hard challenging sets than this set may be to easy for you. The problem for this set is it really necessary to have everything to wide and fat, even the flag. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"zzwhitejd","2009-09-29T14:49:04.717Z","Not overdone, but has great special pieces.","My house (2 young kids; one girl, one boy) loves LEGOS and pirates. The Pirate themed LEGOs are a bit too old (intense?) for my kids, but this set really fits them well. The classic pirate minifig isn't growly/mean or a style my kids would not recognize. The parrot might be my personal favorite planned build thing in the set.
Also, the blocks are basic with several versatile special blocks. The set really does belong to the larger generic block sets as an add on rather than the Pirate theme, just as they have classified it. 
For 10$ and 150 pieces, this set is a must for the creative builder (rather than model makers). ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asteciuc","2009-11-20T13:34:46.2Z","If I could I would give it a 4.5","Initially I dismissed this set as one of those sets that would only be right for a small child but the set proved me wrong. This set reminds me a bit of when I was a child and had to start learning how to use alternative bricks for pieces I did not have or Lego did not make. The ship is just a fun and small clever design while the chest and shark are just cute little additions. 

The alternative designs, I believe, are even better than what the set actually comes with. The sea turtle is nicer than the shark is and the crab is just a little bit ingenious. The diamonds in the chest then double as little pearls at thebottom of the sea. 

The pirate minifigure is what most people will look at the set for. His body design is like no other and very well detailed. His hat is the captain's hat and he comes with two swords. His face is a little off though and reminds me a lot of the original pirates with their sort of dopey smiling faces. I think this is what really makes this pirate set 'kid friendly.' 

The only downside to this set is that the ship is kind of blocky but that's about it. The parrot is a little clever and cute. What really should be stressed is that this set is $10.00. It has 150 pieces. Compare this with Kraken Attackin', which while having two minifigures has only 78 pieces. This set nearly doubles the pieces of that set while matching the price. Just a notice.

What you see on the box is what you get and what you get is good. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-28T11:45:51.047Z","Ahoy Matey, Spare a Diamond?","<p>Set #6192 Pirate Building Set: As an AFOL I chose to pick up this set for two reasons, first of all at the time it was on sale so I got it cheap, secondly I honestly felt that I might be able to use the pieces included with this set someday for alternate building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shall now review this set as a parent might for their child. First of all this set offers up tons of possibilities for the age range listed on the box, not only does it come with instructions for one set of models, but the instructions include pictures for other possible models using the pieces included with this set. And trying to figre out how they made them is fairly intuitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is a nice looking one and isn't too gritty looking as far as Pirates go, plus for any Pirates collection out there you can get a fun throwback to the old Pirates sets with this figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can you build? The instructions included show how to build the following: A large sea chest to hold the three diamonds included with the set. A blue whale or possibly a shark. The pirate's ship. All of these models are relatively simple to construct and look quite nice once they're all put together. Ah yes one more thing, you can build a multi-colored parrot as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The instructions include photos of alternative models (the instructions for which appear to be available on LEGO's official site.) The first alternative model is a small seaside home, with a dock, a miniature ship, a table and a small tree. This grouping of models looks rather nice once they're&nbsp;all built as well and offer fun alternate play choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third alternative model/s involves a shipwrecked scene. You can build a small raft, a sea turtle, an octopus and an underwater scene with crab, steering wheel from the wrecked ship, the three diamonds and a small bit of coral or underwater plant life. The animals are actually rather nice looking for LEGO animals, the octopus is particularly clever in its construction and the crab looks quite cute and kid friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As is customary with LEGO sets the imagination fuels many other possible builds. So Overall I'd say that this set is well worth it for children, for AFOLs, well I guess it's really up to personal preference. All I can say is, if you are an AFOL with younger cousins or neices and nephews that show up for visits, having a few of these types of sets around for them to play with while they admire your older kid's LEGO displays couldn't hurt.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
