Seven Euros for this set is quite a reasonable price - you get a minifig with sword, a chain, two flags an many bricks more for it. I enjoyed building little castles, horses and dragons. Nice colours, needable bricks - all in all a nice set which can be given to children as birthday presents.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"aedil","2009-07-25T09:46:42.937Z","Nice set - good beginner set for preschooler","I bought this set for my 4 year old daughter as an introduction to regular size LEGO, since she had been enjoying DUPLO quite a lot.  The first time we put it together she needed quite a lot of help, mainly with showing her how the pictures in the instructions were best used to figure out what to do in each step.  I ended up doing most of the building.

The second time around (the next day, of course) she did a lot more of the building on her own, paying closer attention to the details of the pictures to figure out whether something was e.g. a 2x4 brick or two 1x4 bricks side-by-side.

In all, the instructions could have been a bit more clear given the age range that this set is aimed at, and also in view of it being advertised (on the box) as easy to build.  One helpful addition to the instructions would have been indicating what blocks are used in each step, as is done for more advanced sets.  That would also introduce the beginning builder to this helpful information in later sets.

Our daughter is really happy with the set, and enjoys it immensely, which ultimately is the goal.  With 137 pieces and 1 minifig, you cannot really go wrong with buying this for a preschooler.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Sebastian","2009-09-10T10:46:07.263Z","different yellow bricks","Nice little set. However mine came with a big flaw: the ellow bricks included were not in the same colour. One of the yellows is brighter than the other and seems to be made from a different material.

Moreover, there are only four building ideas (including the one on the flap) instead of five as written on the box.

The reason I got this set was the alternate model with the Mongolian ruler in his tent. That idea had to be valued.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"yerdna","2011-02-15T16:37:30.6Z","Good old-timer castle set","<p>I remember my first LEGO set I got back in 1982 - it had a lego catalog included and I spent perhaps hours staring at it and dreaming of the sets displayed - especially the huge yellow knight's castle with 14 minifigs!</p>
<p>Well, this set is by far not so big as the old castle but it's nice, has the same color&nbsp;and some great features like the drawbridge with chain and wheel. Having a real horse&nbsp;would be nice but as this is only a basic set that does not bother me that much.&nbsp;If you buy the second knight set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=5929-1"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=5929-1</a> from Bricks and more series you'll have two castles and two knights fighting each other. </p>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,5

It's barely noticeable unless you look really close, but it brought down my rating. <br><br><h4>Building Experience:</h4>This is the perfect size for me, it only takes around 15 minutes but you get a great result.<br><br><h4>Parts:</h4>I didn't have those leaves/vines for the front of the castle before now, but, as I already mentioned, I got two different yellows and that brought down my rating here, too.&nbsp; <br><br><h4>Playability:</h4>Great when more minifigures are added. I mean come on, where's the enemy? I use this castle with my Knights' Kingdom II minifigs.<br><br><h4>Value for Money:</h4><p>I'm glad I caught this on sale, AUD$13.75 is a bit steep, but AUD$11 is just right.</p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span> <h4>Overall:</h4>Fantastic for a Castle starter set, except for the fact that the only enemy is a different yellow.<br>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,5

"LStyer","2011-03-26T17:52:39.043Z","Pack your bags for a nostalgia trip . . .","<p>The first LEGO set I can remember getting was <a href=""../../detail/?Set=6075-2"">6075</a>,
 so this yellow castle all but called out to me.&nbsp; It even includes a 
brick-built horse, though this one has eyes.&nbsp; It was a fun, if simple 
build, and the finished mini-castle looks good.&nbsp; I particularly 
appreciated that it included an operational drawbridge, though I dinged 
""Playability"" because the plastic chain isn't quite as easy to crank as 
the string from 6075.</p><p>$10 is a small price to pay for a trip back in time.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
