This set is small but have some useful pieces, that are one of the characteristics of the other small pirates sets. The two minifigures included are two pirates, simple but nicely designed, like the others. There are also in the set, to combine, three shotguns, a pistol and a sword. The cart is good builted, altough is little, it is creative. The cart uses the three shotguns included and that makes a good effect for the set. This cart also have two wheels that works correctly, exactly like other small carts of the 1990's sets. The building is basic like the playability, due to the size, but this small still great. So, i rate the &quot;Pirates Gun Cart&quot; 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
