However, I doubt that many of you actually need magnetic Lego photo frames so I will tell you how you can save $8 and build it yourself. As you can see each frame consists of only 4 obvious parts, which are two 2x6 plates, one clear 1x6 tall brick, and another of the same brick except that it is non-transparent. Pictures are real thin and can easily be fitted between the two large bricks. So there you go, you will thank me when you realise that you have an extra $8 in your wallet.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Except for the magnet, you can use any similar LEGO piece to get to the same result. BUT if you put the price aside, this simple design is very effective. I wouldn't have paid the full price for it (definitely not worth the money spent), but got them on sale on the shop. Since then, they've been very useful to stick lots of things to my fridge.</p><p>&nbsp; Naturally, you can make LEGO magnets by yourself for less money. But thinking that way, why bother buy brands instead of clones of lesser quality? It's a pity the magnets were not sold for a better price and are discontinued.Anyway, I sincerely doubt anyone who bought 'em regret it.<br></p>",TRUE,5,2,1,5,3
