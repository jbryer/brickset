"Takeshi","2008-12-23T10:34:57.797Z","The monsters are attacking! Deploy Mine Mechs!","This set seems to be a slight copy of some of the Exo-Force battle machines, but it still maintains it's individuality. It comes with the Mine Mech, Boulderax rock monster, and 1 dark green energy crystal.

Mine Mech
Pros: Plenty of articulated joints, so lot's of poseability. Comes with new roll cage piece, and a dynamite piece. The claw functions quite well, allowing you to capture Bouldrax. The drill piece is quite similar to the one used in the Aquaraiders 7771 Lobster Strike, but is still cool. It also has some textured stickers that glow in the dark!

Cons: Besides a strange appearance, none!

Bouldrax
Pros: He has poseable arms, and can hold up to two ernergy crystals in his mouth at a time. Or a piece of dynamite...

Cons: His legs don't move, and he is smaller than anticipated.

"dragon_teenager","2008-12-26T22:31:01.67Z","A good way to sample the Power Miners theme for cheap.","This set is not great, but it is good. It comes with valuable new Power Miners elements, including a rollcage, TNT, some trans elements, an awesome minifigure and a rock monster. All of these parts are great and this set can make a wonderful parts pack. The mech itself, however, is passable if lacking. The main body is cleverly built and very cleanly designed. The limbs, however, are rubbish. The legs are too blocky and the tools are too bare.

I would get this set for one of two reasons:

- To sample the new Power Miners elements and minifigures
- To collect the entire theme

"David1971","2009-01-25T06:38:29.92Z","Nice greens","I had a curious experience with this set: I saw it already built in the shop window (Dominoes in Leicester, UK – turns out to be an excellent shop for Lego, with the whole new 2009 range on display). It didn’t look very appealing really – none of the Power Miners sets looked very amazing. But I wanted to try a Power Miners set so I got this one. And the curious experience is that, through building it, I came to quite like it. I am assuming this is a phenomenon that applies to Lego in general – you get more of a feel for a thing when you’ve built it yourself and appreciated how it’s all done. (Indeed, this would apply more to other, larger, cleverer sets, where there is better engineering and use of parts to be admired). Lego sets always seem much better when you’ve built them, compared to what you see in the photos (even though the box photos are always nicely done) and I guess this is why.

Anyway, this set is, actually, not amazing, but is a fine little set. The lime green parts are really nice … it’s a good colour. The minifig has a strange face … the eyes are especially weird … maybe this is explained in the Power Miners backstory, or whatever, but basically it’s not a great face. But this walker-thing is quite good overall and you can possibly re-enact the climax of the movie Aliens with it.

The rock monster (Boulderax) is awesome, but even though I WAS expecting him to be small, I was surprised at how small he is. You can grab the monster in the claw.

I had this together in about 5 minutes (because i was really eager to build the other set i bought, the mars mission ultra drill walker). 

Anyway, the little rock monster is pretty enjoyable. He can eat the green crystal. But he is really small, and doesn't pose as much of a threat if you ask me. (He's even smaller then the included miner)

The mine mech is pretty cool. I love the minifgure, he has 2 faces, one smiling and one shocked and angry. The actual mining mech looks kinda thrown together, and is pretty short (The picture makes it look way taller then it actually is) But it does have a drill and claws and dynomite!

"Legoman1993","2009-03-23T13:58:22.28Z"," Not bad for a $10.00 set!","This is my second power miners review. I think this set is ok for its price! TLC finally came up with more smaller sets instead of $6.99 than all of the sudden the next set is $15.00 They changed their price pattern a little! I'm glad they did that! TLC needed smaller sets anyways just like the early 2000""s I think the Mine Mec is a pretty decent set,

The machine: First off I like the new black cage piece! The claw is an okay  
feature , although it is somewhat hard to grab anything with! Nice orange colour though! You can grab the rock monster""s feet with it and you won't have any trouble:] The legs are not as good as i thought they would be! The legs are difflcult to make them walk:[ So I put mine straight so it can walk in my case. The cutter works great! It can spin really well if you loosen the pieces a bit. The stick of dynatine is a awesome piece to have, instead of the tile ones we used to have in rock raiders time. 

The mini fig: The mini figure that comes with it is  a good designed! I like the mini fig head! It looks like a professer or a chemist! Cool torso piece, that is coloured blue with a potion symbol on it.  
 
The rock monster: Interesting piece I have ever saw. The arms move and the mouth piece as well.That is a great feature to add on the new rock monsters. Very interesting colour neon green! You can also place a crystal inside him!

"knuclear200x","2009-03-15T03:45:14.31Z","Not that great on its own, but good to have.","By just looking at the box, you probably noticed how unappealing it almost looks.

That claw looks kind of loose. And how does that buzzsaw look cool frontways instead of sideways? And what small feet you have. But the rest of it looks all right. You have those tight ball joints that are more poseable than the joints used in the Exo-Force/Lego Knights Kingdom line.

Anyway I bought this since I just really needed another robot, as well as some of useful pieces that go with it. Maybe do a little army-building...

Cons: 
The arms (in box art and instructions) look like they're backwards. They're also kind of short. The buzzsaw can be rotated but it really would have looked better facing sideways. The claw hand, to my surprise, isn't loose and can hold pretty much anything. But the ""one pincer over the other"" design doesn't really work that well in my opinion. And then there are the legs. The instructions don't really instruct a good idea, as they look froggy and the thighs don't seem too poseable.

Fixes:
Instead of having the thighs' (green plates) facing forward, better to just turn it to the side and they'll be more poseable. The knees/shins 90* angle should be 180*'d for the same reason, and the arms should be 180*'d too, as they'll look better (or more natural, if you will). If you're unsatisfied by the claw as I was, you can disassemble it and insert the cross-pegs into one arm's cross-holes for a better looking, though unposeable, claw. Or make scythe-arms by putting one pincer on each arm.

As for the other arm, the remaining pieces give you very little options. A few things I can think of, are connecting the green ""Axle-joiner"" with the black cross-piece on to the arm so that it ALMOST looks like a gun, or stick in the pick-axe to make it a uh... a pick-axe arm with a short reach. Another nice thing to do is to turn the arms and legs around, stick one pincer on each arm and have the mini-fig stand on the two open pegs (between the levers) to make a neat, little ""four-legged walker"".

If these don't do it for you, then pull out your bucket of extra pieces and go crazy.

Pros:
The cockpit flips open, and its unique to see that the machine levers are behind the pilot instead of in front.

Conclusion:
If you're going to buy this small set, you should have other pieces at your disposal to make it better, like making the feet bigger or the arms longer basically. Or expect very little of it otherwise. Either way, the set can be slightly improved with a few things not limited to what was mentioned above.

In it , it has 2 levers to pilot it and next to it has TNT and a pickax (it also has a signal bulb on top of the roll cage).

"Kalhiki","2009-08-14T15:21:03.607Z","Excellent Mech","My first Power Miners set and now I'm finally getting around to a review. Let's start with the minifigs.
Brains: Tis the scientist he is. And you can tell. On the back of his shirt (or body) he has the saw with a test tube symbol. I've noticed these symols are different depending on the character. The front of his body shows blue suspeders and a white, long-sleeve undershirt. And in his pockets he has what appears to be test tubes. His pants are just like everyone else's: A chain and a flashlight painted on. His head shows grey eyebrows and mustache. He also has an odd eyepiece (For close inspections I suppose.) And he has the helmet that everone else has.
Boulderax: Average rock monster in only in dark green and also comes with a crystal in the same color.  But he's special. This is the ONLY set you can get him in so far if I'm not mistaken. Also a warning for vigorous Lego players. The grey on the rock monsters is just painted on and can chip off. Carefull!
Now onto the Mine Mech. This is actually pretty good. But like most power miners sets, a little small for the price. From the bottom up: The feet include the glow-in-the-dark stickers like all of the sets. Not much else, but the are very stable on the ground. Also not much on the legs except the stickers on the ""knees' of it. Nice detail on those.
The Body has the rollcage with a ligh on it (barraki eye piece if your a bionicle fan.) And it has the 2 on the front meaning it's #2 on the first wave size scale. It has holders for the dynamite and pickaxe, along with two levers for the vehicle controls.
On one arm has the ""function"" where one spins the gear on the back and it spins the orange saw. Not really a function. The other arm has the claw which, sadly, doesn't realy pick up anything that well. The arms are short limiting the range of posability.

I've always liked twenty-first century LEGO mechs, and I love this!
But there are still problems.

Pros- 
Cool model.
Cool rock monster.
Cool miner.
The arms and legs take no time at all!
Rare pieces.

Cons-
Brains can't attach to the Mine Mech that easily.
Once you DO get Brains attached, the cockpit takes him off again!

"r2d2qa","2010-01-14T18:43:09.593Z","Great!","The first time you look at a LEGO Power Miners set you think "" this look so childish. "" but never trust the box. I got this from my parents on my sister's birthday (my sister gets something little on my birthday and get something little on hers) it looked more  kids from the age of 4-6 but when i opened it up and built it was (same thing what i said on the title.) i'll make a pro and con list to show you well... the pros and cons:)

Pros:
- the Brains minifigure has a double sided head and well... he's the Brains!!
- Only set where you could get the Boulderax figure.
-        Dark Green Gem. (I like green.)
-        Pick Axe and Dynamite. (MhwuuuuHaaHaaHaaHaa...Haa)
-        Orange and green color scheme.
-       Mech has Saw Hand and Claw hand. 
-       The Price is reasonable.
-      Can be combined with set 8956 Stone Chopper to make a pretty cool vehicle.

Cons: 
- Mech has short arms and stubby legs. 
-         Bottom of the Mech's feet don't connect to LEGO Bricks.
-         The Claw is kinda bad because both of the blades don't touch each other. 
-         The Saw arm is longer than the Claw one.
-         I don't like where the dynamite and pickaxe are stored on the Mech.
-         the little Trans Orange thing on the very top of the Mech (is it a light?) isn't good because it's short and can't be put in the middle of Mech, but that's not much of a problem.

In the end, it a cheap set that if nothing else interest you, you should buy it.
it's also good starting set if you want to start collecting Power Miner LEGO sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-17T20:57:52.14Z","Can't stomp on the rock monster with this one...","Ok, one thing: THE LEGS ARE SMALLER THAN THEY LOOK IN THE PICTURE!

Now that that is off my chest, I can tell you the rest. I got this for the reasonable price it is sold for (about $8 USD), and comes with Boulderax (Exclusive rock monster to this set) and my favorite Power Miner, Brains. Pros and Cons incoming...

Pros: 
1. Great figures included
2. The claw is actually good for holding the Monster or the crystal
3. Pick ax to fight off Boulderax
4. Pretty flexible

Cons:
1. It's kind of tiny
2. Like said before, the light should be in the center, not on the side
3. Sometimes, the top that opens and closes breaks off (Hard to fix)

Parents: If you think you won't have to help your child with this set, you may be wrong. If they are used to Bionicle part, they probably won't need help. HOWEVER, the legs and arms are a little hard to build for a kid under 8 years of age. When finished, though, it will be very flexible.

I do recommend this set to fans of Power Miners, especially those who are used to building Bionicle sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"roborovskilego","2010-08-05T12:43:14.947Z","This is Small But Worth it!","<p>This set is small in all, but if you spend time with it long enough, You'll realize size isn't the only thing that matters here. A small Lego set is better than nothing right? By the way it'll probably be better than you expect so I would recommend this to all power miners fans.</p>
<p><b>Building Experience - </b>I thought I had a great time building this. The only part that is really hard are those sphere shaped parts you have to snap in. This might need parent help. In the end though, your mine mech will move better than any set you ever dreamed of! There are other easier pieces to this set though thank goodness.</p>
<p><b>Parts - </b>There are some pretty cool parts in here. The claw uses two cool parts that you can also find in the claw digger. There is also a wrench like piece in the back of the mine mech. This doesn't occur very much in other sets and it holds up the claw and drill. There is also the cockpit piece not in very many other themes.</p>
<p><b>Playability - </b>Playability is one of the best parts of this set. The mine mech moves very well. His claws open and close very well. The drill also spin well too. This could probably even act out the computer generated mine mech in any of the clips. Cockpit opens and closes very nicely and it doesn't really break off. If you know I got all this playability stuff on in only a couple of minutes. I think playability is pretty awesome if I could do that!</p>
<p><b>Value for Money - </b>The value for money is okay I'd say. To be that price it would have to have at least 100 pieces. If you need to ever know a good priced set, You should take the price and multiply it by ten. Any extra cents on the end you can just divide by ten. The price multiplied by ten should be the amount of pieces that set has. your other answer for the extra cents should be added on and the set should have at least that many pieces. How I know? The rule for price is ten cents per piece.</p>
<p><b>Overall Rating</b> - Here it comes the overall rating! I would give it a five star rating! The only thing I thought that wasn't such a good deal was the price but that was still four stars! Everything else was five so that rating is almost unbeatable! I hope that this review was helpful because I don't want to be posting junk!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T22:23:45.943Z","Boulderax is Hungry","<p>Set 8957 Mine Mech: My first exposure to the new dynamite piece was with this set, and for that alone I would really dig the little mech, but there is so much more going for this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all the titular Mine Mech is a fun little vehicle to build. It uses some familiar pieces to bring together the look and feel of a heavy duty excavation tool, and if the mech has trouble breaking through the solid rock with the saw blade on its right arm the pickaxe included might just help out. (You have to make a spot to place the dynamite before blowing the granite walls open to reveal those beautiful shiny power crystals.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boulderax is a fun little Mini-Figure too, although all of the rock creatures share the same basic body the different colors are what really make each one worth having. Buying the cheaper sets to score a few of these nifty looking creatures for your Mini-Figure displays ain't too shaby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A unique feature of most of the first run Power Miners sets is the ability to take the pieces of two sets and combine them (using instructions from LEGO's online site) to create even zanier looking vehicles. A feature I haven't tried out yet, but one that really adds to the value of owning both sets required to build the new vheicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes a little work to get the Mine Mech to stand up without toppling forward, but a few moments of fiddling and the mech will stand up just fine, all in all I'd say if you like LEGO Underground themes like Rock Raiders and Power Miners than you won't be dissapointed with this set. Especially if you already have Stone Chopper to merge with into the aptly named Cave Cutter. Plus this set is a cheap way to get the new Dynamite piece for your LEGO Accessories collection.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
