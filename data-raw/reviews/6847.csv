"Toa_Of_Justice","2008-12-29T10:17:27.45Z","The Granite Grinder Really Rocks!","The Granite Grinder may look rather basic, but don't be fooled! There are actually quite a few interesting structures in this model, as well as a bucket-load (pun intended) of special features (some of which I discovered only after putting this model together)!
+Pros+
Jackhammer function
Treads
Opening cockpit
Glow-in-the-dark caution stripe stickers with a rough texture (!)
Removable hatchet
Adjustable and removable spotlight that can be attached to either side of the vehicle
Chain-attached rear bucket
Miner minifigure with two facial expressions
Rock monster's mouth opens up, and he can eat either the crystal or the dynamite
Wheels on top of removable gas cylinders can rotate
Many cool pieces (dynamite, crystal, orange Lerahk staff tip, 1x2 grilled slopes, etc)
-Cons-
Rear bucket just drags along the ground (I think it needs some wheels)
Rock monster's head occasionally comes off (but it's easy to put back on)
Only one crystal (I think it needs at least one more)
*Overall*
I am very pleased with the Granite Grinder, and I highly recommend it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Takeshi","2009-01-03T13:41:23.827Z","Drill away!","This is an awesome set, and the functions work quite well. It includes Glaciator, the Granite grinder, and a trailer/sled that has quite a bit of cargo room. To the Pros and Cons.


Granite Grinder (including trailer)

Pros
The front drill is made of a rahkshi staff piece and will function like a jackhammer when the set is moved forward. It also includes a floodlight, axe, engine piece, oxygen/fuel tanks, roll cage piece, and dynamite. Also, this set has textured stickers that will glow in the dark (it has to be REALLY dark, or you have to put it under a lamp). As said before, the sled has quite a bit of cargo room.

Cons
There is nowhere that the dynamite is supposed to be placed, so you have to put it in the trailer. The trailer has a stud bottom, and catches on rugs, causing it to flip over, but this is fixable. As with several of the other Power Miners sets, this one is smaller than it appears. 


Glaciator
Pros: poseable arms, and can hold two crystals in his mouth if you put them in just right.

cons: His legs don't move, and he's a bit smaller than anticipated.

I own the old Rock Raider Granite Grinder, and I think that this one is better. I would reccomend it, as it is a very nice set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pretty useful for a $10 set! When built, the Granite Grinder is tiny but good looking, with a compact, realistic design (relative measure). It has a piston drill in the front that is not only very functional but the source of endless amusement for those who grasp the suggestive implications. 

All in all a lovely little set. People complain that it's small, but I think that's mostly due to the compact design, and stretching it out would result in a less complete-looking model.

This thing doesn't look like much more than a green and black box-ish thing with treads and an orange bucket chained to the back of it. It isn't much more, yet it still managed to be a nice little set. Why? It has nice details decoarating it, a miner (I'm pretty sure it's Rex) and Gaciator. It also has some fuel tanks on the back and planty of stickers, a mjor con to those of you who hate em. It looks much better with out the orange bin dragging behind it, so LEGO could've put a better picture on the box.

It has a flood light on one side. While there should have been one on either side, what more do you expect from an afforadle set? These miners have double sided heads, too, alowing for a normal or a worried expression. There is also a blue crystal, that's right, just one.

The only cons I have is that I think LEGO could of added another monster, mini-fig, or crystal in the set and that the light fixture that is supposed to be on one of the gas tanks is hard to snap on straight with the steering wheel part.

"HQuiff","2009-02-17T14:42:49.95Z","Glaciator!","I just picked this set up today from my local Toymaster!
Maybe the best set ever. It may be small, but for it's price and it's awesome functions I'd say it definitely makes my top 5! It is though, the most fun set to build!
The main function is of course the grinder, which is at the front! It works to perfection, when the treads move, the grinder goes back and forward! 
I also am in love with that moving role-cage ability.
OK, onto handy pieces. Firstly, you have the grinder (Unique), dynamite (Unique), Rockmonster (Love it to pieces!), bucket (Also unique), and finally the crystal (You can only get it in Poweminer sets).
Onto Pros and Cons for now.

Pros: 
- Glaciator (The Rockmonster)
- Grinder ability and other functions.
- Miner with double sided body and face.
- Detachable spotlight and bucket.
- Dynamite (Great for clearing rocks)
- Blue crystal.
- Role-cage and cabin that can fit a Rockmonster & a miner)
- Wicked Engines.
- And realistic feeling stickers.
- Perfect price (10€)
- The best set to build in years! Not fiddly and frustrating!

Cons:
- Only one blue crystal!
- Nothing else! =p

I highly recommend this to anyone! Collectors, people who are new to Lego, people who are looking to get their first Powerminers set, and just everybody in general.
I'm so glad I bought this, because believe me, this is really a joy!
OK, I think I've my point.

Pros:
Cooling Jackhammer with Lehrak staff piece
Glaciator, miner, trailer, and crystal
Cool single piece treads, and good sturdy design altogether
Dynamite, rollcage, gas cylinders and hacking axe

Cons:
No Wheels on the trailer
Needs alot of crystals 4-7 more
Very small (Vehicle, not monster)
Elastic is loose, and almost always falls off (I fixed that by moving the black piece on the staff forward one hole)
Floodlight.....why did they add it? (If they wanted a floodlight, at least put one per side Lego Group)
Lotsa small stickers (Textured one s'aright)

As you see there are a lot of cons, but that's just my opinion on this Grinder. And another thing, why did they take the name of an old rock raiders set? I would've called it the rocksmasher or something....

"Shadow_Crawler","2009-07-03T11:43:52.34Z","Only One Crystal?","Here's my first Power Miners set, I got it with 23.5% discount.
Box : 5/5
Sweet box art, it looks like Boulderax is chained and forced to pull the bucket :D, the treads looke shiny, and there are some chunks on the edge of the jackhammer. However, it looks like there are several crystals shining on the bucket, in reality there's only one crystal included.

Instructions : 4/5
Pretty strange, you open it by turning it upwards, but the image of the set doesn't fill the front page fully. It's clear enough and has a faint image of a cave around the page.

Building : 5/5 
Not so fun, it's quite complicated to build the jackhammer system and would suit a Technic fan well done. However, building the top part (the cockpit and the gas vaults) is just fine.

Playability : 4/5
Oh nice, the jackhammer really works when you roll it, but a HUGE con is the bucket wasn't firmly attached to the main vehicle and it falls down easily.

Compare With Money : 3/5
In Indonesia it is priced for Rp 199.900,- or roughly equal to US$ 20.00, pretty nice for 94 pieces (in Indonesian standard)

Overall : 3/5
Good performance, I'll give it a four if I live in the US, but since I don't, well..
You should buy this if you love Power Miners or if you like rock monster (as I am) By the way, Aero Shredder is nice.

It is an awesome feature will gears that will turn the drill, witch is pulled back by a rubber band, and sent forward again. the lamp is small, and easy to carry and lose, the device itself looks as a gas guzzler and is completely environment unfriendly. two huge rgas tanks are one the back and a indestructible rollcage sits upon the driver. The rock monster is awesome, withe the crystal you can feed it. You can make it light the dynamite or break the fuel tanks to blow up the entire cavern.The trailer is the worst part of this set. First, it comes of very easily. Then it is too large to hold a small crystal and isn't very useful to carry stuff.

It is such a compact little vehicle, but once with the miner inside it all seems to make sense. He has his control panel and his tools...even the tanks on the back have some nice labels on them. Its fairly realistic.

If anything Id recommend getting several of these babies as they are cheap to buy and can be modified easily with the other power miner sets.

The miner is a typical gruff sort, and the blue rockmonster is ok; a worthy adversary. 

The only questionable thing is the trailer/skip. Is it meant to be dragged instead of wheeled?

Still its a nice little set all in all:

Pros:
- Nice size 
- Stickers look great
- Rollcage, lamp and pressure valves are nice details.
- miner
- Dark blue Gem

The Miner isn't anything special. He has nice detail on his pants (a chain and a flashlight) that are painted on. His body isn't much either. On his back he has a symbol that's a saw with a drill inside. The helmet is a nice mold, but once again not much to say. His double sided face is awkward. the 'scared' face looks more like he's cracking up laughing rather than screaming at rock monsters. But other than that it's a good guy.
Glaciator isn't much either. He's a pretty blue color and I like that. the whole set only comes with one crystal. I'd like two. I also, unfortunatly, found out that the gray parts on the rock monster are just painted on and can chip off. 
Now to the meat of the set. The Granite Grinder is small, but it's god for just carrying around. The bucket falls off easily, so when you pick it up you may want to hold onto it. The chisle works nicely. As you push the machine across the floor (works on pretty much any surface) the chisle will go in and out and make a Chicka Chicka Chicka sound. But if you do this alot it'll were down the plastic parts and make some fuzz in the inner workings. This will happen less as you keep playing with it.
So I bet you're wondering how it works. Well, the back tread wheels are connected to each other. In the middle of the connection (an axle) has two four pointed gears. The chisle is on an axle and on the end is ball joint. When the machine rolls, the gears turn, pushing the ball joint away. Then when it's out, it goes back in via a rubber band (visible on the outside). 
The gas cylinders are a nice touch. And the engine which looks like it's running when you push the Grinder along because of the gears mentioned above. 
Accesories include a hatchet (we're miners, not loggers), a spotlight (i love that thing), dynamite, and one blue crystal. And that pretty much covers it all.     ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

minifigs: average miner, and glaciator is way too common. I don't double up on sets and I already have three of him. 3/5

price: a bargain. 10 bucks is nothing. 5/5

build: quick, not too easy. Its fun too see it come together. 5/5

set itself: the treads are awesome, the drill works flawlessly, the gas tanks in the back are wonderful, the rollcage is positioned well and the pieces on the sides, with the 3 sticker on them, are useful and look very nice. I actually like the way the bucket drags along behind the main part and the big headlight on the far side is nice. dynamite is also a plus. 5/5

playability: the drill action never gets old and the set is small enought so that glaciator is a legitimate threat, unlike thunder driller where firox is basically a joke. 5/5

overall: 23/25 you should add this to your collection.

"EtudeTheBadger","2010-03-29T16:21:42.06Z","The Granite Grinder Returneth!","As a Rock Raiders fan, it's quite refreshing to see a vehicle with the same name as one of your old favourites appearing in a contemporary theme. <br>Of course, this Grinder is rather the antithesis of the old, trading size and power for agility and being able to fit in smaller areas. And it's cool! This was my first Power miners set, and a worthy opener.<br><p>The Granite Grinder (to avoid confusion, I'm talking about the new one!) is a great set, and the vehicle is a pleasure to build. One of its main attributes is the big fork-shaped drilling appendage, which is funnily made from a Rahkshi staff blade (Lerahk's, if I'm not mistaken) and can only be described as a little bit of genius. BIONICLE parts look cool integrated into a mining vehicle, make no mistake! The gas bottles are a cute addition, as is the ax on the side of the vehicle.</p><p>The track-based driller is superb, too- a traction-based gear system with a ball joint actuator. Never would have thought of that, I must say. The miner is good, along with his protective rollcage. The sled is cute, along with a blue Crystal- finally, some variation on the Crystal front! Glaciator also comes with the set.</p><ul><li>Pros: <br></li><li>New series, new vehicle- all looked good when I opened this thing!<br></li><li>Mechanism is impressive</li><li>More tracks- LEGO is returning to its roots</li><li>Blue Crystal</li><li>New monsters</li></ul><ul><li>Cons:</li><li>Maybe too many stickers...<br></li></ul><ul><li><br></li></ul><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

<div><br />
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When you role vehicle the front claw moves back and forth with the wheels</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very small (easy to carry and take places)</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has a very nice cockpit like all power miner sets</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very sturdy not very many pieces fall off</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;I cannot think of any cons right now because I believe the granite grinder doesn't have any! &nbsp;I would recommend this set to lego fans because I'm sure they will have a blast playing and building this awesome pick of the litter!</div>

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T22:37:19.28Z","Glaciator on the Prowl.","<p>Set #8958 Granite Grinder: The third and final Power Miners set I've picked up so far, this one is another of the smaller sets worth every penny. It includes some wonderful Mini-Figures and a very impressive, bulky looking excavation vehicle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the vehicle is simple and straight forward, like the other sets stickers are used to enhance the vehicle. This set includes a gimmick which allows the large Technic drill piece to move back and forth as the treads roll along. A word of caution, do not push down too hard while rolling the vehicle otherwise the wheels will pop off preventing the gimmick from working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A piece I suspect belongs on a LEGO City dump truck is used to transport the dynamite and crystals found by the Granite Grinder. This makes for a bit of a curious decision, as the piece drags behind the Granite Grinder and any jarring would most likely set off the dynamite if it were severe enough, or dislodge the crystals leaving them behind the Grinder in its wake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glaciator is the same base mini-figure creature, but this time it's in transparent blue to match the blue crystal that comes with the set. I think the creatures used as enemies of the Power Miners are all nice additions to my Mini-Figure collection, even if they do share the same basic mold, and can't wait to get some more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't yet own the set that this one can be merged with, but perhaps one day soon. Overall I'd have to say that all three cheap price points of the Power Miners theme are great in their own way, but I am a tad more partial to the Granite Grinder than the other two, if only because it looks like it could fit in with any Space or even City display with the right bit of imagination. If you're interested in Power Miners then picking up this set would be a good way to judge if you like the Theme or not.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"Mystical_Møøse","2017-07-24T14:32:24.95Z","Small size, but fun all the same","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing special or notable, push tabs on the box, instuctions are ordinary stapled ones, left loose in box.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Generic Power Miners minifigure, nice enough, although the face seems a bit odd, as the eyes are very close, and he has a bushy monobrow. Glaciator, as the Rock Monster is called, is far more interesting, due to the style TLG has adopted for these creatures. It&#39;s possible to close the mouth with a crystal inside, allowing him to &#39;eat&#39; it, and his arms have the same connection as a normal minifigure, and can be swapped. His hands cannot be rotated.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Decent selection on parts for the size of this set. The orange dumpster and jackhammer aren&#39;t too common, and the cockpit and lime green slopes are always useful. Standard small rubber tracks don&#39;t look great, but suit their use fine.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Pretty simple and quick to do, makes use of a small Technic assembly for the jackhammer mechanism, nothing much else of note. Stickers are easy enough to apply.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s quite compact, and wider than it is long. It seats the miner comfortably, and the jackhammer works perfectly. Two petrol tanks are mounted on the back, and there is a hook to attack the chain on the dumpster to. It should be noted that it only really rolls well on a rough surface, such as a carpet, and would not function as well on a smooth one, such as tiles.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>For the price, it&#39;s difficult to do better. You get a good selection of parts, a sturdy vehicle and a rather unique function that works very well. It&#39;s certainly a fine set to own. I&#39;d probably give it a 9/10.</p>

"weekend3990","2015-10-04T18:37:43.627Z","Great mining vehicle ","<p>This is a great little mining truck and a good addition to any Lego power miners collection. The mechanism&nbsp;to make the front fork move back and forth is very clever using the tracks to make it move. You only get 1 minifig&nbsp;but you also get a blue rock monster. All in all a good compliment&nbsp;to any larger power miner.</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>The front miner moves back and forth as you move the tracks</p>

<p>Comes with a rock monster</p>

<p>Good to have as a kind of side kick to a larger power miners set.</p>

<p>CONS:</p>

<p>Could have been better if it was a bit bigger but as only a cheap set then its good value.</p>

<p>No other cons.</p>
