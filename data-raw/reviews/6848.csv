"Takeshi","2008-12-23T10:16:25.327Z","Warning! Heavy Machinery!","This is a really good set. It includes the Claw Digger, Sufurix rock monster, and two neon green energy crystals. (This is especially good if you had some of the older Rock Raiders sets)

Claw Digger
Pros: Sturdy design, new roll gage piece, new dynamite piece (awesome), new huge wheels, awesome engine. Also has a convieniently placed shovel bucket for scooping up crystals. This is one set where you want the stickers. Some of them are textured and can glow in the dark!

cons: The wheels, being solid plastic, don't spin on smooth surfaces. Also, if you put down the shovel too far on textured surfaces (e.g. a rug) and move it forward, it will catch on the surface and possibly snap off (but don't worry, it'll snap back on!)

Sulfurix
Pros: poseable arms, and can hold two crystals in his mouth if you put them in just right.

cons: His legs don't move, and he's a bit smaller than anticipated.

Summary: Good set, but don't let the pictures fool you. It is just a bit smaller than you may think",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legojango","2008-12-24T20:16:19.653Z","WAY better than I expected","This set is very good for anyone who likes ank rockmonsters or are in need of lime-green peices. I will just list my Pros and cons.

Pros:

Includes rock monster :)

Sturdy (will not break easily)

Texturized stickers (There can't be tecturized peices, that would be lame)

Could be used as a construction set if you take off the claw aarms.

Awesome new wheels

Cons:

Sulfrix is lime-green instead of yellow :(

Can onlt be driven on low carpet or LEGO baseplates :[

"dragon_teenager","2009-01-09T17:50:38.42Z","Surprisingly good","Power Miners aren't as good as Rock Raiders, but their sets aren't as bad as many have made them out to be. This vehicle, for instance, is very cool, with some awesome new parts and great detail.

This set is great because it's a relatively cheap way to get the awesome new wheels, and the look of the model itself is very cool. It looks like a mining machine (if you ignore the color scheme) and the pickaxe-arms come down with a satisfying clunk. It also has a great looking engine in the back, which is possibly the best engine I've seen from an official set. Nicely done there. 

On the down side, the set is much smaller than I expected. Also, I don't like how the gray sticks poke out of the back wheels... I feel that could have been resolved by the designers pretty easily. It should have been about five dollars cheaper, but by today's standards this set really isn't that badly priced; I wouldn't let that keep you away unless you're on a budget. 

All in all, this is a good set, one of the better out of the Power Miners line. I recommend it. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"SaintElsewhere","2009-03-07T22:26:29.937Z","Very good","  I never got a single Rock Raiders set, so while some are saying that Power Miners is a blatant rip-off of Rock Raiders, I welcome it.
  The Claw Digger is very well-built and I am guessing it could easily withstand underground cave-ins, rock slides, et al. The wheels and engine are oversized & powerful, perfect for going over rock. I like the roll cage and the headlamps but am not a big fan of the scoop.
  The miner is neat and I really like the rock monster, which is kind of cute in a mischievous, evil sort of way. The accessories are all brilliant, from the crystals
to the new dynamite piece. (WAY better than the old 2x1 SNOT tiles with the dynamite painted on.)

Minifigs: Miner- The miner is your basic miner that we have all seen but this guy is an engineer. His helmet is the same and comes with no goggles. His head has some scars and stubble on it and looks pretty cool. But I'm not a big fan of the scared face side.
Sulfurix- A trans-green or yellow monster. Nothing too special here.

Claw Digger: A really nice design with about five or so stickers. The claws unfortunetly do not move when the Digger is in motion. You have to turn the nobs on the side to move the claws. A slight dissapointment considering the fact that they could've done it. I like the new wheel pieces which appear in most of the PM sets. There are three equipment holders in the vehicle. Good for storing pick axes or shovels etc. There is an engine on the back that is very detailed and looks great. Nothing much more to say except; If you are a Power Miners fan!

"Toa_Of_Justice","2009-05-25T15:26:18.03Z","Pros, Cons, and Suggested Modifications","I was quite interested in the Claw Digger when I first saw pictures of it. However, I was hesitant to buy this model because some reviewers were complaining about design flaws, such as the fact that without modifications, the bucket up front can't pick up crystals very well. I will now summarize the pros and cons of this model, along with a few suggested modifications:

+Pros (12)+

+ Swinging claws that work very well
+ Front bucket which moves up and down
+ Opening cockpit with a seat and controls inside
+ Tools that be stored on the vehicle
+ Huge detailed engine
+ Giant wheels (each one is about 2.5 inches in diameter) that can roll on just about any surface
+ Glow-in-the-dark stickers
+ Two crystals, both of which can fit in the rock monster if inserted carefully
+ Rock monster (Sulfurix) with opening mouth
+ Miner minifigure (Rex) with two facial expressions
+ The model doesn't take up too much space on a shelf
+ Good price to parts ratio (considering all the large and special parts in this model)

-Cons (4)-

- Claws drag when the vehicle moves (Easy built-in fix: The claws can be tilted up and made to rest on two little stubs on each side of the model.)
- The bucket up front can't pick up crystals very well (Somewhat easy fix: Add a ""Link 1M Fric/Fork/Stumpf"" [available in quite a few recent sets and through Pick A Brick] in between the bucket and its mounting point on the Claw Digger. This will allow the bucket to lay flat enough to scoop up crystals.)
- The very rear part of the engine wobbles sometimes (Unfortunately, I can't think of a way to fix this flaw aside from removing this part from the engine)
- No rocks for the Claw Digger to smash apart (unless you count the rock monster)

*Other*

* A communications antenna can be added to the roll cage. Just use the included extra control stick (and any of the other extra pieces, if you wish).

Two crystals instead of one.

The map is outside of the cockpit (wouldn't it get dirty?)

The first set of the new theme that I had my eyes on was the Claw Digger, so I was lucky enough to get it just before the stores went out of stock.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the box art: I am aware that many folks have no care for the box art, so feel free to skip this section. But if you do care, then I'll let you know that the Power Miners series had amazing box imagery. They illustrated all of the action features of the set in several ""metal"" back-grounded windows, plus the set's accessories and rock monster.<br><br>&nbsp; On to the core of the review: The build. As my rating suggests, you will not be disappointed by the building experience. It is quite short for the size of the set, and very intriguing, most notably the engine. This engine is no cheaply designed element. Of all the Lego sets I have seen, this is the finest, most greebled engine ever. Naturally, many MOC'ers could come up with something better, but for a stock Lego set........... <br><br>&nbsp; About the parts: These parts are terrific for custom creations. You will find lots of technic parts and many fine greebles in this set. The only things lacking are bulky ""block"" bricks. Despite the sort of pieces used, the Claw Digger comes out feeling very strong and powerful. With the huge engine, monstrous wheels, and sturdy construction, the Claw Digger can take on any terrain. Or it feels like it could.......<br><br>&nbsp; As for playability: The Claw Digger is one of the neatest Power Miners sets to romp around with. It's action, although not ""automatic"", is certainly the most powerful action in the series and can tear up any creation or creature in its path. Very satisfying. However, a problem arises if this is the only PM set you get: Sulfurix stands absolutely no chance. He has no real attack power, compared to the other monsters. (A bit of storyline: Sulfurix is the most intelligent of the Monsters and has the ability to quickly melt round tunnels ahead of him without having to dig. No special powers for combat.)<br><br>&nbsp; Overall, I would certainly recommend this set. I got it at the price of 19.99, which was well worth it, especially because this was the only set that contained Sulfurix. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
