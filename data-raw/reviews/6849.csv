"GSX_R_4S2","2009-03-21T23:41:22.733Z","WAAAAAAAAAY TOO PRICEY","So...Here we have the kingpin of the first series of Power Miners, our new branch of Rock Raiders. So far we have a nice series, with great play features formed from all of Lego's experience. But let's get onto this particular set.

Positives

First off, it's nice and big. Obviously, that's what you expect from the largest and most expensive set of the series. The sweeper feature works okay if you have the ramp lowered and the vehicle is going relatively fast. It also looks pretty good as a whole, and fits its mold of ""underground combine harvester"". The drill and bike on either sides are a good accent, the engines look pretty nice, the roof can come off, and on top of that, we get a nice little monster launcher to go with the two rock monsters. The commbination vehicle also looks fantastic and has a nice dumping feature.

Negatives.

It's expensive. By expensive, i mean incredibly overpriced. It's a whopping 70 dollars for like 470 pieces. Compare that to the Thunder Driller, which had 300 something pieces and was only 30 dollars. Think about it. You're paying 25 dollars for the added size of the box, maybe. This should at least be reduced to 50 dollars, if not 40. Other than that, all I can say else is that the sweeping feature isn't very user-friendly, and the monster launcher is fairly weak.

Really, only buy this set if its on sale or you're a huge fan of Power Miners. It makes an impressive addition to the team if you get over the 25 dollar rip-off.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"HQuiff","2009-03-27T16:04:37.437Z","Sweep Up The Crystals With The All New Crystal Sweeper!","When I first saw this set, I couldn't resist the sweet charm of the Sweeping feature, which I think is much alike to a combine harvester. So, I got the last set in my local Toymaster today and took hours gazing at it. The whole thing is just amazing really. OK, onto the full outlook.

Build: 7/10. It was really fun, until I ran into some problems with the wheels position, I had mistakenly put some technic pieces at the wrong part. Anyway, that's just by mistake, so I suppose if you do it right it'll be OK.

Structure: 9/10. It has a sturdy even structure if you have the positions of the pieces right. Everything is fine apart from the cabin though. It sometimes comes off if you push to hard on it while using the function.

Functions: 10/10. It has the best functions to a set that I've ever seen! The Sweeping ability is amazing! It functions great on any surface and DOES work with the caterpillar tracks. It picks up crystals fine too, just remember when you're setting the crystals out to put a lot of space between them.
Right, moving onto the cabin. Well the cabin is fine as it has enough space to fit the Miner minifig perfectly, and it has a removable move. And the Mining function is worked to perfection as well as it can turn 360 Degrees and can move right up and down. And finally, the place where the bike i stored is perfect! The bike slips up and down A+

Rockmonsters & Miners: 9/10. The Miners are fantastic, although Brains' (The Professor) head is a bit wierd looking... the other miner is good though, he has a double sided head which on one side has a brave looking face, and on the other a scared one. The Rockmonsters also are great! And They work well with the Rock-a-pult as well.

Playability: 9/10. It's great for ""Broom!!"" sounds you make when you're having fun! :) The whole thing is just generally fun anyway, you can just use any scenario you think op of! As long as it has something to do with Power Miners and Rockmonsters.

Price: 9/10. For €50, it is worth every penny! Seriously! I know you only get 414 pieces but still... I mean it's just...great! That's all I can say! I mean, I'm speechless.

Overall: 10/10. It has proved to be great in every aspect! Well worth €50! The look and everything is great from all angles. Just get it while you can!

"Bricknave","2009-03-17T16:57:45.373Z","A very good set to build!","This is an awesome set with a variety of bricks!  If you're looking for a Thunder Driller alternative, you should get this.

Pros:
LAPTOP BRICK! :D
Lots of crystals
Rubber band treads
Orange Motorbike
Drill
Lime green bricks
The function really works!  You just have to adjust the grey ramp on the bottom and move it fast enough in order for it to collect the crystals!
Cons:
The control room is a bit too small
Crystals sometimes get stuck under the vehicle

Rating:  4/5

"Takeshi","2009-04-09T13:08:32.263Z","Sweep the floor with the rock monsters!","This is (currently) the largest set in the Power Miners series, and has quite a lot of  functions and more than a few quirks. On to the Pros & Cons!


Crystal Sweeper
Pros: Nice sweeping function, side mounted ""laser drill"", excellent detailing,  and textured stickers. There are also several noteworthy pieces, such as an orange motorbike, huge orange bucket , a roll cage, two of the huge orange spiky wheels, a drill (currently found only in this set and the Thunder driller), 2 telescope pieces, 2 sticks of dynamite, a laptop, and strangely enough; a crate with a banana! It also has alot of grated 2 by 1 slants. It can be used on both smooth and rough surfaces

Cons: The ladder that seves as a ramp for the bike is too high, but this is easily fixable.  The cockpit is very cramped, and the two levers are higher than the drivers head! (this is also fixable). The biggest problem is with the sweeping function itself. There are three main problems. 1- If you push at the wrong speed, the crystals will either shoot out in front of the sweeper, or they won't reach the bucket. 2- Sometimes the crystals will get stuck on the ramp, and will hinder further play. 3- If the ramp is too high, It gets caught on the gear.


Rock Monster catapult
Pros: It can launch two monsters at a time, and is very sturdy and won't flip when you launch the monsters.

Cons: Sometimes the monsters go straight and down, instead of arcing up and going farther.


Minifigs: This includes Brains with goggles, and another guy that has a metal plate stapled (not actually, just printed, but it does actually have some texture to it) to the right side of his head, also with goggles. It comes with Glaciator (blue) and Meltrox (red). As with all rock monsters, they can swallow crystals and wave their arms, but their legs are unmovable.


Summary: This is a great set, but not quite great enough for the price they have for it. I would suggest getting it only if it's on sale, or you need it to complete the series. I give it a 4/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cameljockie","2009-07-28T16:48:38.297Z","Its time to bring in the harvest!","I was quite dubious about the Power miners line. The first wave wasnt promising a great deal in terms of design and functionality. However once you go out and buy one...it becomes contagious. 

As is the case with this model. The Crystal sweeper is a large hefty excavator like vehicle designed for collecting those precious Gem stones. When its pushed the rotating mechanism activates and scoops up the crystals into the massive orange storage tray. Once you've done sweeping you just push down on the trey and it tips down just like a digger.

It runs on two rubber caterpillar tracks which in all fairness are too small for a model like this. The end result is something that is compact and cartoon like. 

Having said that it does utilise its space well as its unusually wide. The cab is great with a set of controls (but no seat) for your driver. The drill on the side is a nice additon especially with the roll cage attached. on the other side are some storage crates and a motor bike and exit ramp.

The miners look great, but the monsters in my opinion are quite pointless as they can only open their mouths and wave their arms about. and their launcher is an uneccesary add on.

The price tag of £40 is very steep going for a model this size. but once you've bought it the reality aint so bad.

Judging by some of the second wave power mining sets this one stands out quite well, mainly due to its sweeping function. 

So:

Pros:
- Great functionality
- Rough Textured stickers with a nice warn industrial look.
- Great exterior details such as exhaust, cab lights & storage crates.
- Rear bucket tilt function.
- Two miners
- Laptop

Cons:
- Rock monsters...erm...
- Catapult. what is the point?
- Over priced
- colour scheme may not appeal to some. 
- Stickers.

So a worthy purchase if you like the power miners and their vehicles. But if price is an issue you may want to go for the Granite grinder....",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The monster catapult lauches pretty far (hint:  it can lauch 4 monsters at once if you get them on there right)  Another cool thing is the laser drill.

CATAPULT PROS AND CONS.

this catapult is okay. but we hardly use it! it is also kinda boring...
Pros:the catapult has very cool boulder pieces!
alot of pieces for building underground viggnettes!

cons:a little boring

VEHICLE PROS AND CONS.

the vehicle is SWEET! we love to sweep up the crystals
pros:almost every thing!

cons:the top comes off easily.
you have to push the treads REALLY FAST to sweep up the crystals.
pricey.

"mr_brightside711","2009-06-27T21:45:09.153Z","Clean up those crystals... Or just launch them.","So after getting the Thunder Driller I had to get another one! I saw this and was so excited to get it. So I did. I read other reviews and alot of them said that i didn't really pick up the crystals. But who cares? It still is a cool set right? Yeah. It is.

I had alot of fun building this one. It was pretty short for one of the larger sets.

One thing about this was the price is maybe $10 overpriced but I'd get this if I were you. The rock monster duel launcher is also nice. Too bad I doesn't work too well.

Pros:
2 rock monsters: Glaciator and Meltrox (blue and red)
3 blue crystals
3 red crystals
2 orange crystals
Some new Peices
Orange motor cycle 
2 big engines
2 lights on top
Neat little laser drill
Some small diamonds
Banana
2 dynamite sticks
Laptop
Large bucket that can dump out the crystals

Best Feature: Somewhat the ability to sweep the crystals

Cons:
Stickers (that do look good on it)
Only 2 minifigures
Rock monster duel launcher doesn't really work
Since the treads are rubber, mine are a little bent and miss-shaped
The cockpit is a tiny bit too small

So now you might be wondering how you launch the crystals.
If you make the sweeper go very fast over crystals it will pick them up very well. Only half the time, those crystals will launch! VERY FAR! 
THIS SET IS GREAT! IT'S A GREAT ADDITION TO THE POWER MINERS COLLECTION!

It is easily the most play-able set ever. I love the rock monsters, the catapult, and of coarse the sweeper, it can sweep up minifigures rock monsters, random junk, crystals, and 3 by 4s!

"Kalhiki","2010-05-28T14:15:11.297Z","Collecting the Crystals","<p>Okay, I don't know why I haven't written a review on this yet, but now I am. The Crystal Sweeper. What can I say?</p>
<p>The building experience was fun. It was very entertaining making the scooper sweepy thing, and the gear function to go with it. As usual, I'll go to the minifigs.<br/>Meltrox and Glaciator- Yes, Glaciator. Personally, I'd like Boulderax 'cause&nbsp;he only appeared in one set as far as I know. What about Glaciator? He was in like five (ok, maybe I am exaggerating a bit, but I don't really know). They are your average ordinary monsters, so not much. It is a weird team, though. Melty is lava or fire based while Glacy is more ice/water. </p>
<p>Miners- Your basic miners, not going into much detail with them. You get the metal headplate guy and Brains (frankly, he's the only one whose name I can remember). As usual, they have double printed bodies&nbsp;with their own emblem on their back&nbsp;depicting what they&nbsp;do (Brains has a test tube&nbsp;for example). And they both have helmets with goggles and a double printed face.</p>
<p>As is common with power miners sets, there are accessories galor. The monsters have a catapult, which is pretty fun to fling them&nbsp;with. It also has a nice rocky look to&nbsp;it. On the sweeper itself it has an orange&nbsp;motorcyle, a shovel, a harpoon gun (or mini-drill), a laptop,&nbsp;and a very random and somewhat out-of-place banana. And&nbsp;of course there's two&nbsp;dynamite pieces.</p>
<p>The sweeper is a very spectacular build, I don't even know where to start. How 'bout the back? Looking at it from&nbsp;the back on the&nbsp;left side, you'll see a drill&nbsp;arm thingy.&nbsp;The arm can spin around and move up and down. There's also a small driver's seat to&nbsp;operate it. On the arm there is a chain, which, like the banana, is a little out of place.&nbsp;While I'm still on the drill,&nbsp;I must say there's no gimmick to spinning it.</p>
<p>The right side has most of the accessories. The motorcycle parks here, and beside it, it has the shovel and mini-drill. The other side has two boxes. One is open where you can see the banana, and the other is closed. Inside it holds diamonds in lime green and blue. Back to the motorcycle, there is one problem I have with it. There's a small ramp that folds down, so the bike can drive off. I'd like this ramp to hit the ground, but when it does, it's nearly vertical. This leave you basically with a drop off to drive over. Therefore, you have to angle it up a bit in order to&nbsp;have it&nbsp;a bit realistic.</p>
<p>Speaking of realistic, I'm surprised how much realism Lego did put into this. On each side of the sweeper, there is&nbsp;a highly detailed engine.&nbsp;They have vents, pistons, and even smokestacks. On the front of it there are lights which are just transparent studs.&nbsp;Let's take a look at the cockpit. On the outside there are the spotlights which look very cool, some orange lights on the very&nbsp;top, and vents on the front. On each side there is one dynamite piece.&nbsp;Inside, there's a big steering wheel which uses the same piece&nbsp;that can&nbsp;be found on top of&nbsp;a propane tank from the Granite Grinder set and I'm sure others. The big wheel makes it&nbsp;look more like a pressure valve rather than what it's supposed to be- a steering wheel. There are also some levers seemingly for driving, which also enforces my whole pressure valve&nbsp;idea. Why would you need both? (one's for speed and the other's&nbsp;a stick shift, duh).&nbsp;I also don't like the fact that the driver needs to be standing in order to drive. I'd ike him to sit.</p>
<p>No I haven't forgotten the main attraction. The sweeper part is a very simple design. By rolling one of the treads,&nbsp;three gears will begin to turn, leading up to the wheel. Any crystals like the red, blue and orange ones that come&nbsp;with the set that are&nbsp;across the path will be swept up, hit the top, and land in the bucket at the back. It's a nifty device, but it doesn't always work. Sometimes the wheel will be spinning too fast and will fling the crystal forward. Other times, it'll&nbsp;go too slow and not fling it&nbsp;into the bucket.&nbsp;It was a nice idea, but it could have been manufactured better.</p>
<p>Okay, almost done. I&nbsp;know this has been long. Finally, the price. Size wise, it's not worth 70 bucks. Maybe 60.&nbsp;However, the overall mass is. Yes, I'd pay 70 for it, but I highly recommend&nbsp;finding it for a cheaper price if possible. </p>
<p>Thus, concludes this insanely long review. I'm pretty sure I got all the main parts, though I may have missed a few.&nbsp;So, overall, I highly recommend getting this, just maybe for a cheaper price.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"Bricky_Dee_Williams","2014-05-28T17:43:39.75Z","Power Miners pack the power.","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>First off, the set came in a good sized box. All the pieces bags fit inside the box well, though there is extra room that they slide around in. The instructions however ripped a bit easily, and were folded up inside the box, and were hard to unroll. They were quit easy to follow though, and there was a pretty good amount of piece distributed throughout the steps. On the downside, this is one of the sets where it is easy to mix up dark grey and black bricks from looking at the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts were very interesting, and many of them i didn&#39;t previously own. They came in some rare colors: orange and lime green, as all of the Power Miners sets do. The bucket that the crystals were swept into was a cool piece, especially in orange. It does come in a few other Power Miners sets. The drill topper piece is an interesting piece, with its spiraled grooves on the edges circling it. It did seem a bit out of place, coming from the thin boom of the crane arm holding it. The dirt bike was a nice addition, though&nbsp;I don&#39;t know where you would use a dirt bike in the mines. The treads on the sides were also some great pieces, as were the orange claw pieces that make up the front sweep. Finally, the window piece in the top control center is a very cool piece, though the &quot;glass&quot; part doesn&#39;t come out of the white brick. Also I&#39;m usually not big on stickers, but the stickers included on the front have a cool texture, as if the front were actually caked with mud.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures all come with the great new blue mining helmet piece, and each has their goggles on the helmet. They all come in their mining outfits, though the faces differ: One of them is old, one younger. The rock monsters,however, are absolutely amazing. The heads lift up for them to &quot;swallow&quot; crystals, and they come in cool transparent colors of red and blue.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Building this set was not exactly a great challenge, but was a fun building experience. It seemed a bit repetitive building the front sweeper, but most additions to the set were new and interesting. The crane/dril on the back was a fun part to build. The top control room was also fun to build, with the levers inside and the &quot;steering&quot; wheel inside. The wheels and treads were a fun part on the sides, and the sweeper, though it seemed the same build over and over, was cool to see coming together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished model has a lot of features for playability, like the drill on the side, the ramp (ladder) for the dirt bike to access, and the sweep on the front that really works, pushing the crytsals up the ramp, and into the back bucket. The roof lifts off of the control room for easy interior access, and the treads roll along as the sweeper moves forward. The set also inlcudes the catapult to launch the rock monsters at the sweeper. The model is quite stable, and is a great set for display.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I received this set for Christmas in 2009, and have loved it since. My verdict: Its absolutely amazing. Great playability, great pieces, cool minifigures. Sadly, it goes for well over US $200 these days, but if you can find it for a reasonable price, pick one up. You&#39;ll be glad you did. It&#39;s a great addition to any collection.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Very stable</p>

<p>-Great playability features</p>

<p>-Sweeper actually works</p>

<p>-Great assortment of different pieces in rare colors</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Pricey as of 2014</p>
