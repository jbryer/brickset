And it's a tiny one which means it can be hand carried... and this is exactly what it has, handles for holding at the end opposite to the huge red ram.  The design is interesting, with the large wheels and the shield to protect the rammer from archers, however aesthetically it doesn't look too attractive.  Nevertheless the design is solid and it is one of the best small siege machine out there.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This was released in the year of 1993, so, this have no new features, but is good to play with. The minifigure included is a basic black knight that have a helmet, shield and spear. The minifigure is also simple designed but in a classic lego style, looks like a lego knight. The ram is good builted for a simple small set and have some useful pieces like the joust spear and the sword, or the four wheels and the small plates that makes the base of the ram. The ram's wheels, like in other castle small sets, like the cart, rolls very well, and combined with this ram, too. In the front of the ram there is not a massive weapon, but it still good, to makes the correct weight for a small ram and also makes the design still good.
The playability is basic and the fast roll capacity of the ram makes it better, but nothing is new in it. Altough the set is really small and it have no new features, this set can increase some other and in the simple building and playability, all works very well, also including useful pieces. Overall, a great small set, so, i rate the Battering Ram 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
