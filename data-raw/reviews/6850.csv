There are no surprise features as with most small sets but the pieces were pretty good.

"lotographia","2009-05-04T04:39:04.747Z","The Chicken Chef comes before the Egg Chef.","This set is interestingly designed for one so small. The box is actually sitting on its side. It's rare to see a set like this that you can't connect to a base. I'm not complaining about this, I actually quite like it. I like to see Lego thinking outside the square.

This set is appropriate for any Lego city. You can set it up anywhere that pedestirans might pass. Also, it's not a police, fire, hospital or construction theme, so it adds a new 'flavour' to the city. I get somewhat tired of everything having the same theme all the time.

I think maybe if the umbrella had red stripes and the white box had a 'hot dog' sticker on it, and maybe if the chef had another box for drumstick storage with a couple of extra drumsticks, this set would have been even better. Not that there's anything wrong with this set as it is, these are just ways I think it could be improved.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MGDawson","2009-06-25T05:51:57.903Z","Important Addon","For a set costing so little, it certainly has many features (it might be a idea to buy this to combine it with city corner to get 2 chefs).

The grill/fridge is a good design, but a shame it doesn't fit to a baseplate; though lego deserve commendation for using bricks in a AFOL way.

It could do with another drumstick (I raided my Viking Ship for its two) and maybe caps for the mustard/ketchup dispensers.

Could've also done with a larger umbrella. But then again, you  have to compromise between cost and playability.

"AETerry","2010-09-07T15:44:56.667Z","BBQ Stand Review","<div class=""description""><p>I got this for myself at Christmas, spotting it in the aisle with several other sets in its price range. And it was an easy buy and impulse item too at $3.49. And what's more, it's an awesome little set to help fill out anyone's Town/City themes.</p></div>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are on a single, folded sheet with clear, easy to follow step-by-step illustrations on both side.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>As a small set, there's only 22 pieces. Not too many specialty items other then the chicken piece for those looking for food item pieces.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get a Chef minifigure of which I don't have too many of and this is a cheap set to get one in if you didn't have one already.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The build is very simple, quick and easy. You'll be making a Street Vendor's stand where a chef is selling his wares. You've got enough to accent and suggest the grill, condiments, food and storage box for holding food in.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>While a small set, it's perfect for filling out a Town/City theme with a Street Corner Vendor or in a Park. It just makes a great, small essential set for adding character to a larger Town/City theme. And I've been very delighted to include this set as part of my collection.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,5
"Doctor_Leg_O_Brick","2010-10-03T04:13:25.92Z","Fantastic!!","<p>I got this set a few months back when i went looking for S2 minifigures, and i found an box with nothing in. Then, as i was walking down the street i saw this along with 7567 and 5612 and i&nbsp;had to buy them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE BUILD</p>
<p>Nothing big. It has 22 pieces and a one page instruction book that has no mistakes. The time for the builder to build this wonder is about 1 minute, but if you take your time, then its&nbsp;about 3-4 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PLAYABILITY</p>
<p>Great, even on its own. Having a chef in this set&nbsp;adds even more playability, along with his chicken leg and the stand. If you have a city in need of a stand like this, get it!! Even if you have a football ground you could add this set out side it, like real ones do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PARTS </p>
<p>Great mix of old and new, and as one other reviewer said, this is one of the most interesting uses of a letter box/mailbox, as a refrigerator. My only grunt here is that the parasol, like in classic town, could of been printed like 10036 pizza-to-go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE MINIFIGURE</p>
<p>I had never had a chef, so i was extra happy finding this! He has a chef hat, chef torso and a head used on many city figures these days. His legs are plain black, mostly used on firemen and police men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE MONEY</p>
<p>Amazing for £2.50 GBP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OVERALL RATING</p>
<p>This has to be a five because of all the amazing things you can do with it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5

Before this set coming out, I really had a hard time to find a chef 
minifig. So, when the set launched, I grab a couple of them for my city.<br><br>In term of ideas, I think this impulse is great because it really different from other impulse in the City theme. Usually we have an impulse of police or firefighter or builder. So, this impulse coming with a chef is really refreshing.<br><br>What I like about the set :<br>- A chef minifig --&gt; nice<br>- A food hawker stand : I put the sets here and there in my city. By using a bit modification, I can create a lot of food hawkers, e.g. a hot dog stand, a hamburger stand, a french fries stand, etc. You just have to change the chicken piece into the food of your choice.<br>- The details : eventhough this set is only come with 22 parts, but they still have the details. Look beneath the grill for cooking and you will find two pieces of trans orange round brick 1x1 acting as a fire/heat. Look also on the other side and you will two bottles, containing chilly and tomato sauce.<br><br>What I don't like about the set :<br>- NONE!!<br><br>So, City lovers out there, you must have at least one of this set, to make your city more alive!<br><br>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

This set is actually pretty good and I like the use of parts to build a little side-of-the-road food stand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chef Mini-Figure is also a nice touch. He comes with the stand, ketchup bottle, mustard bottle, a turkey leg and what I assume is intended to represent a can of Coke. (Or LEGO Brand Soda Pop.) He was well worth the effort to track down and he is also well worth the price. These types of Impulse City sets are exactly what we need, unique and fun little models that enhance the City Theme past the Emergency Crews/Racers/Construction Teams and other same old, same old sets. If you haven't picked this set up yet I highly recommend it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw this set on lego.com and thought that it would go great in my city. One day when i was in the store I saw it in the lego aisle and grabbed it before anyone else could. The build is fairly simple and i put it together in about three minutes. The chef minifigure is fairly rare to find nowadays and that is another reason why&nbsp;I got it.

"Harmonious_Building","2012-03-18T19:57:14.64Z","A movable feast.","<div>Roadside food is a great urban tradition that I feel has been around at least since the existence of the first cities, so it’s only appropriate that the LEGO City finally gets a roadside food stand of its own.</div><div><br></div><div>This compact set won’t break the bank, and it will certainly go a long way in providing a lot of flavour (pun intended?) for your city on the go. The chef Minifig is fairly uncommon these days, so it’s nice to see him make a comeback, and the BBQ stand itself is a pretty elegant construction in spite of its simplicity. What’s particularly neat about this design is not only are there almost no “studs on top” (save for the tip of the umbrella), there are no studs on the bottom, either, which means that you’re not at all constrained by studs when placing the BBQ stand - which is pretty much the point, since roadside food ought to be able to move around a bit without too much difficulty.</div><div><br></div><div>This set makes me think that a food subtheme for City would be pretty neat. I don’t know if “food trucks” are a common thing in Europe, but they certainly are in American cities and a LEGO version of one would be a great addition to any city. Also, when oh when are we going to get an updated version of a restaurant a la Breezeway Cafe (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6376-1"">6376</a>)? At bare minimum, if LEGO City intends to fully support its battalion of police officers, we ought to at least have a donut and coffee shop or something. Just throwing that out there, since I know that top engineers, designers, and marketers at LEGO are obviously reading my reviews. Hi there! You’re doing a great job!</div>",TRUE,5,3,2,5,5

I put this set in my park, it looks great there, along with the accessories in the Lego City Minifigure Collection #8401. If you want a little food selling stand, then this set is the perfect answer. <br><br>1. Accessories: The accessories are a chicken wing or leg, a soda can, mustard and ketchup jars, and an umbrella. These are great accessories for this set, especially the mustard and ketchup jars. The umbrella is also great, every stand needs an umbrella, and the little chicken wing or leg, is a great food choice for this set, but there could have been another one or there could have been a popsicle piece for the cooler, but that's not what I worry for, the main thing is that these are fine accessories. <br><br>2. BBQ Stand and Minifig: The stand is great, it has a grill, an ice cooler, and holders for the mustard jar, ketchup jar, and the umbrella. It's cool how there are little orange stud pices under the grill, to make it look like it is lit. The cooler is cool too, but there are no studs to hold it on a baseplate. And last, the minifigure, the chef is great, with his hat, uniform, and brown bearded face. You can also make the chef work with the feamle chef at the pizza place that comes in the Lego City Corner #7641. <br><br>This set is better than good, it's great, and the best part is, this set can really help your open spaces in Lego City.

I finally rebuilt it so I could use it in my city. It is a nice useful set for a city. Read to know why.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Takes about a minute. No inspiring building techniques here..</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>22 pieces. Some rare ones are the chicken leg, transparent oven piece, brown bar and the chef hat. For an impulse set, a nice parts selection.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>You get a chef and a small BBQ stand. The chef has a white cooking hat, an orange beard, a white 8-buttoned shirt and black pants. He holds a chicken leg in one hand. A nice minifig, I would say. The stand is white&nbsp;and has a small umbrella. The oven opens up and inside there is a small red 1x1 cone, which I don&#39;t know what it is supposed to be representing. Mustard and ketchup are included here and two orange transparent 1x1 studs serve as fire.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Well, this was a short review, but what do you expect when I am reviewing a 22-piece set? This set works very well in a city, although it has limited playability on its own. I&#39;d recommend it for any city. If you find this review unhelpful, please contact me to give me some advice to write better reviews. Goodbye!</p>
