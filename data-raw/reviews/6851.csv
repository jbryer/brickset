"water_jedi_17","2008-11-13T22:24:20.827Z","Looks vaguely familiar...","For a new pirates line, this set is excellent for army building. The soldier mini figure is quite detailed; even the back has a bag similar to Indy’s bag although it is printed. The weapons holder is similar to the one in The Knight set which makes this set seem more like a repeat of that set. The main weapons holder holds an Spalko blade, a wooden rifle, and the backpack, although in the picture it is on the floor for some weird reason. Overall a great army builder, although a more creative design could’ve been used instead of copying 5615.Good job lego pirates, great comeback!

"Paradoxymoron","2008-11-28T17:07:08.86Z","Awesome set!","I loved pirates before, especially the British marine guys so I couldn't resist. I bought this today at TRU with 8397, 6240, 6239, and 6241.  This was a quick and easy build and as mentioned before it is a great army builder. Unfortunately mine was missing the musket. I disagree with the previous review saying the hat could be simpler and the old torsos were better. These new hats and torsos have more design and seem more realistic to me. I, again, reccomend waiting until this set is out somewhere else to buy it cause it's way too expensive at TRU. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Evan345","2008-12-17T00:07:20.903Z","Nice Army Builder","Mine came with an extra sword and an extra whatever that blue thing is called...

Pros
detailed torso (front and back)
detailed hat
rare rifle
rare(ish) pistol
sword (mine came with 2

Cons
it couldn't have hurt to give a few more pieces
over used head (not something to complain about really)

"Captin_Rex","2008-12-02T19:14:01.31Z","Good little set.","This was my third pirate set, It is a great army builder for the royal guards. Now lets see some pros and cons.

Pros,

1. 1 minifig
2. 1 mustket
3. 1 short gun
4. sword
5. stand to put weapons on
6. back pack


This set is a good set. They are $5 at toysrus. You should get 1 or 2 because there great to have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2009-05-12T08:38:55.937Z","Lots of Weapons!","This set is good, especially if you want to have a huge collection of weapons for your army, whether it's pirate, castle, police, or even a knife-wielding mob.

Box : 5/5
Excellent, really attractive and nice.

Instructions : 3/5
It's basically just a printed paper, do not expect a booklet.

Building : 3/5
The building process only last for about 2-5 minutes. You'll build a minifigure, a rack, and weaponry. The rack is similar to the 5615 The Knight, but this is smaller.

Playability : 5/5
You'll have a hundred ways to play with this if you have Pirate's Survival also. You can play with a soldier, a pistol, a backpack, a rifle, and 2 knives.

Compare With Money : 4/5
This set is priced for US$ 3.49, in Indonesia it is priced for IDR 59.900,00 or equal to US$ 5.21 or roughly 3/2 the US price, still, it is worthy enough.

Overall : 4/5
This set is to buy if you want to build an army of if you want to have lots of weapons. This set is basically similar to 5615, only replace the minifig and with a smaller weapon rack. Overall, this set is good to get, not too expensive and you'll get a lot.

"lotographia","2009-07-23T03:59:25.827Z","Constructive criticism.","There are two things wrong with this set.

The first is that the minifig head used here is the same one in almost every set containing a soldier. The exact same minifig is even used in the next most expensive set after Pirate Survival, so if you're collecting from the bottom up, you will very quickly double up.

The second is that the stand doesn't really look like anything. It's basically just a collection of bricks designed to stand up and hold some pieces of equipment.

The redeeming features are the weapons, one of every type of pirate minifig weapon available, and the classic backpack which isn't in any other set but this one. The backpack earns the set a four where it would have otherwise have got a three.

A better set, and maybe one that could be used later down the line, would be 'navigator'. It would include a table with a map, a telescope and a sextant, the latter piece not being in any of the recent pirate sets so far. Maybe the telescope could be on some kind of stand. Also, the navigator could have Indy's satchel to hold his equipment in - all my soldiers are equipped with spare Indy satchels, it really is a good use for them and they do work remarkably well with the soldiers.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"davy_jones","2009-04-12T07:54:34.437Z","tin soldier?","One could never possibly consider this a stand alone set. Its very very simple, hence the price and size and is meant to complement larger sets. On its own it comes with a accessory stand and several items. It is well designed but I feel a telescope or torch could have been thrown in. Another gripe i have is the pirate captain minifig is only available in one set where i live and its way to costly. Why dont they sell the pirate captain in one of this little boxes? After all Indy minifigs are available in so many sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"DJimBo","2009-04-08T10:24:37.31Z","A very nice pirate set","This is maybe the best pirate set to build up an army of the marines, wich is pretty new in LEGO pirate history.

you can see on the picture what you'll get.

pros:
- nice accessories.
- a marine.
- neat marine hat and nice things on the shoulders.

cons:
- no...

It's a great pirate set for a good price, probably better than his neighbor, pirate survival (8397) because the marines all look the same but pirates don't. you get nice accessories for the price.

"legofan666666","2009-05-16T16:43:22.39Z","awesome set and figure","This is a GREAT set for the price only $3.49 (without tax). It comes with tons of weapons including 2 swords, a shotgun, a pistol, and 2 neck cuffs (the things the figure wears that go around his neck), and a backpack. It comes with one minifigure and it is very well designed. It comes with the British-type hat for minifigure. The building time is really poor it took about thirty seconds to build it. But  I guess thats what you have to expect with these extremely small sets. But if you looking for lots of weapons and a British guy ( I dont know what to call them, LOL) GET THIS.

"Nased","2010-09-16T23:03:55.96Z","Super Army Builder set","This set costs me SGD$5.5 and I swept about 9 of them that were left on the shelf in a local retail shop. In terms of cost, I think it is very affordable. With the relatively low cost, you get many different weapons which are very useful to build up the imperial army troop.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Things that you get:<br/>Soldier x 1<br/>Sword x 2Rifle x 1<br/>Pistol x 1<br/>Backpack x 1<br/>Weapon rack (shelf) x 1<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The excess number&nbsp;of weapons can be shared by soldiers from 6242 (Soldiers' fort) and 6239 (Cannon battle) where each and every soldier may not get their own sword or gun. The minifigure itself is a nice addition to 10210 (Imperial Flagship) as there are not enough soldiers on the gigantic imperial ship. So this is definitely a good addtion to the biggest set of the Lego Series<br/>&nbsp;<br/>At the same time, the weapon rack of this set can be mounted onto the big Imperial Flagship or Soldiers' Fort, hence making every part of this set a bonus to the entire pirate collection. The build may be too fast as there are very few pieces but it's a great feeling to see the increment in the size of the imperial troops.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Conclusion: Just get it before this series comes to an end.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For dollar value you get a lot for a cheap price, by which I mean that there is a lot of play value and fun in this set.
