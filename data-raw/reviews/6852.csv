"MatrixQuest","2008-11-17T08:12:56.343Z","&quot;Impulses&quot; shouldn't always be followed","First off, the pirate sets were always nice sets, just cause pirates are cool...  I love the fact that the upper torso of the minifig has paint on the front and the back, which is a rarity in most sets.  The fish brick is nice and is now laying around my Aquaman custom...but I would have rathered the brick attach differently or not at all...but at least we got a fish.  I've never been fond of the brown pistols...a wooden gun???  Jewels are nice pieces to own, but how many do we need?  Now, the crate is not a bad piece.  It's the same one that came in the Indy Motorcycle Chase set and if you get several...you can use them in an oriental style garden.  You can use it in other places.  But that's about it.  The building part of the set is a 3 piece fire that is way too simple...they could have made it like the one in the Indy Jungle Dual set with cross cones.  That is all you get as far as a building set, 3 pieces.  Basically...there is nothing to build here.  These sets are not worth the $5-6 prices they are now asking.  Ten years ago these came in a baggy for $1.5 to $2.  That is one heck of an inflation rate.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2008-11-28T16:58:15.11Z","Fair set","I bought this at TRU today along with Loot Island, Soldiers Arsenal, Kraken Attackin', and Cannon Battle.  This is a useful little set(literally) and there's not much to say about it. It has great parts including a new crate, a new fish peice, 2 gems, a stick for the fish, a fire, a pickaxe and a snake.  It's a great set but I reccomend you wait until 2009 to get it because it overpriced at TRU. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"allencao3","2009-01-14T02:56:52.937Z","Good impulse set with one of the best looking figs.","I am not a typical Pirates fan but I decided to buy this one and 8396 after seeing the pictures. This for the nice fig and 8396 for the assortment of weapons etc.

As I said I bought it mainly because of the minifig, here are a couple of things I like
- Great color scheme, dark green and brown look neat together
- Matching color on legs and bandana!! 
- Double printed torso with the rope across the chest, little vest, tattoo (I guess?) in shape of an anchor and the hairy chest lol. I like all the details which made the fig fabulous.
- A new head with cool beards/mustache and facial expression
- Fish piece!!

There could have be more useful accessories other than the fish and pickaxe. But the set is worth the price merely for the minifig! I gave it a 5/5 in rating.

"Nuke","2009-01-09T14:26:49.14Z","Nice set","is a good set, my only disappointment is that there are no spare/extra parts and pieces.
In all set i own, at the end of the construction there are 2/3 spare/extra pieces.. but in this set no one!
Sometimes when in the set there are small pieces (gem for instance..) an extra one is present...

Nice minifig that has torso painted on the front and the back, which is really good.

Total rating for me is 4.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"SimonStickfish","2009-03-16T11:17:49.077Z","Nice 2009 pirate starter set","Although I generally prefer the old style (80's and 90's Lego Pirates), I just bought this small set for 2,99 euro's in the Netherlands. I was especially interested in the new style pirate minifig, the snake and the fish. It's not much, the price per piece was about 19 eurocents, but I was curious for the new style. The pirate minifig has a nice detailed texture. What I like about the new generation pirate set, is that almost all the minifigs are unique (except for the pirates, who appear the same in most sets). I've combined this set with #6270 now, there was plenty of space left for this green headed ""Lego Pirates The Next Generation""-minifig and his stuff :-)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"lotographia","2009-07-23T04:15:24.343Z","The slightly inconsistent adventures of a lone pirate.","Like the backpack in the Soldier's Arsenal, this set contains one unique piece to make it noteworthy - the pickaxe. Without the unique piece, the set would have got a two, but even with it, it's still not worth a four.

This is more of an 'accessory pack' than anything else - there's no real consistent theme. What do the pickaxe, the box and the jewels have to do with 'pirate survival'? If they had gone with one theme or the other I would have given the set a four, but half 'pirate survival' and half 'treasure hunt' makes the set a little confusing.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"davy_jones","2009-08-27T01:45:01.59Z","A friend in need...","I call this review a friend in need because this set is not a stand alone unit. Its similar to the army soldier impulse set. This one of course has two 'living' beings (the minifig and the snake) and therefore has somewhat increased playability. It serves better as an add on to maybe the pirates island set or kraken attackin set. I give it 4 since i like the flame piece, the snake and the two jewels.

"DJimBo","2009-04-08T10:17:47.967Z","Good pirate set","I would say: 'if you don't have many pieces, buy this one.'
I've got many pieces(also snakes and gems) so this is just only for the pirate and for the new fish.

You can see on the picture everything you get.

pros:
- snake, gems, flame and new fish
- pirate
- pirate gun.

cons:
- if you don't have any other pirate set, than I won't buy it.

overall it's a good set for a good price. it contains nice pieces but it would be more usefull(and less expensive)to buy the set 6239.

"mngoult","2010-01-06T08:03:01.2Z","This could be my shortest review yet.","Not a great deal to say about this one, it does exactly what it says on the box. The new pirate minifgs are quite nice with good heads especially. Its nice to have an axe instead of a cutlass the pirate has plenty of possessions.

The fire should be more like loot island, its only a few quid so options for people who want extra weapons and pirates or like me if you bought it just to complete your collection.

Three stars as its good value but offers nothing new.

Pros
New pirate figures are nice.
Good value for money.

Cons
No effort gone into fire.

"Nased","2010-09-16T23:19:12.32Z","Wonderful Addtion to the Crew of BBB","<p>I was a little shocked when I saw the low rating of this set. I think that this set deserves a score of around 4 to 4.3 due to its multiple pros and very few cons. Let me explain in greater details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>1) Cost: It cost me only SGD$5.50 to purchase one of this set and you get a minifigure with very good prints and many good accessories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Accessories: Pick axe&nbsp;X 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pistol X 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Snake X 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gem X 2 (Red and green; so I suppose it's ruby and emerald)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Playability: This set is not fantastic to play it as a stand alone set but when you put 1 or 2 of this set onto 6243 (Brickbeard Bounty), the pirate adds as a perfect addition to the small crew onboard. This pirate is self sufficient with a pistol and hence it doesn't need to take any weapon from the Brickbeard Bounty. There is this addtional crate that can be put on the big pirate ship and most importantly...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two gems add as a additonal bounty/loot to the pirates treasure onboard of the big ship. It's really awesome to see the number of gems belonging to the pirates&nbsp;growing overtime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons: Easy to build and&nbsp;playability on its own without other bigger sets is limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion and verdict: There's no need to get more than 2 sets. However, I think 2 sets of this is a decent number because it serves as a perfect addition to the biggest pirate ship of this new pirate line. Just get a couple since it's cheap and fun to play with.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"jones545","2010-09-14T18:25:26.993Z","This set looks cool","<p>&nbsp; This set looks good for people to buy. But it only comes with one minifigure so there is a little use on your collection for minifigures. But it does come with crystals,a fish on an stick. The Pirate is on an island stuck. Help him surival.</p>
<p>&nbsp; This set comes for the pirates theme. One minifigure. Some crystals,a fish,a stick and a box. This a set that a lot of people want. So get out there and buy it. It looks a lot of fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp; When you buy it you will be suprised by what it comes with. The next good set is the Imperial Flagship. But they don't have the minifigure that comes with this set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-28T15:08:47.48Z","Sea Turtles Mate","<p>Set #8397 Pirate Survival: As far as Impulse sets go this one is a real head scratcher. I mean what exactly did LEGO think when they first decided upon the stuff to include in this set? It's not as bad as it could be, but it isn't exactly the best of the bunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pirate Surivial comes with a lone Pirate, a red snake, a box for the two jewels included with the set, a pickaxe to bury the box, a fish for roasting and a small campfire. Oh yes plus a weapon so the pirate can defend himself... I wonder though if it has only one bullet and if this pirate was marooned after a mutiny?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LEGO could have done a lot better with this set, in fact I think it might have been more interesting to have an actual treasure chest with this pirate, and maybe a spider too for varieties sake. There is a lot of potential to improve upon this set, here's hoping that if Disney Pirates include any Impulse sets they get it right.</p>",TRUE,3,4,1,4,3
"Ernst","2012-04-03T13:54:50.16Z","The lonely Pirate","<p>Overall 4 bricks : What to wish for a price like this ? A good mini figure with nice accesoires you can add to your other Pirates sets. Nothing more and nothing less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 2 bricks : no building required, just assemble the minifigure and the fire to roast the fish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 4 bricks : for a decent price you get a minifigure, a snake and&nbsp;a fish, a fire, weapons and 2 daimonds and a pickaxe to bury the treasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 3 bricks : the single set is not very playable but added to other sets like <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6239-1"">The Cannon Battle</a>&nbsp;(he can use some help) this set has good playing possibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks : For some € 4,00 you get a good minifigure with all kind of usefull small extra's, not a bad deal.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,4
