"Takeshi","2008-12-30T11:09:12.967Z","Hey, was that a wall? I didn't feel anything...","This set is definatly my favorite power miners set that I have gotten so far. It has quite a few awesome features, such as and a drill that rotates both ways at the same time! Awesome! Pros and cons time.

Thunder Driller
Pros: It is well built and has awsome new pieces like dynamite, huge spiked wheels, and the new drill bit. It makes amazing use of gears, including an intersting gearbox piece that I've never seen before. The engine room has a removable top, and allows you to fit a miner and several enrgy crystals (although this set only comes with two). When you the vehicle forward, the drill turns counter-clockwise, and the grey piece behind it turns clockwise by using a very ingenious system of gears. The set also has those textured stickers.

Cons: Some of the stickers a hard to put on, and the wheels only turn on a rough surface, like rug or baseplates. Also, don't let the picture on the box fool you! it is a bit smaller than you think.


Firox
Pros: poseable arms, and can hold two crystals in his mouth if you put them in just right.

cons: His legs don't move, and he's a bit smaller than anticipated.


Summary: This is an awesome set. If you are thinking of getting the claw digger, see if you can save up the 10 more dollars needed to buy this one. It's definately worth it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Republic_Commando_Sev","2009-01-19T22:05:32.013Z","The Best Power Miners Set!","I bought this a couple weeks ago at Toys R Us.

The Box: On the front of the box, it shows the Thunder Driller in action, drilling, with Duke in front of it snatching a crystal from Firox. On the back, it shows some of the functions, like the spinning drill and opening compartment, and also the combo model.

The Build: You dump it out, and 234 parts come tumbleing out. You get a lot of wheel pieces, (which are really big). You start by building the mini-figs and tools, and then the  bottem, with the axles, and plates which you build up on. The build is pretty fun, and it doesn't take too long to build it. Once it's finished, you get one heck of a model!

The Finished Product: The finished product is amazing. The wheels are HUGE, and look so awesome on it! 
I'll slow down, and start from the front and go back. 
The drill is utterly amazing! It's very big, and spins in two seperate directions. It spins when the front wheels turn, which turns a gear, which turns another gear, which turns another gear, which turns ANOTHER gear, which turns a 3 or 4 gears inside the drill making it spin. I really love the spinning drill function, it's just so cool!
Now, the wheels are amazing. Very thick and big, and there perfect for mining. I like the mudflaps in front of the front wheels. (I think there mudflaps anyway)

I like the capartment in the middle, it 's big enough to hold two mini-figures. I store Firox in there, when I'm not using him. I do wish there was something else in there, it's just empty besides one gear.

The cockpit is at the back, and theres two engines on the side of it. It has two control sticks, and for some odd reason a flame blasting out of a hole, into the cockpit. I don't know why Lego did that, it looks cool, but the mini-figs would fry. Theres also a kind of geological map/control panel thing too. To the left of the cockpit is a storage container, which is big enough to hold the Walkie Talkie, PickAxe, and Dynamite. The Dynamite is a very cool piece, and I'm glad Lego made it!

The two spot lights on top are very cool, and I like how one chain hangs over the side of the top. It also has a sticker on a 1x6 brick, and it says ""Pnuematics"" or however you spell that.

The MiniFigs: The Minifigures are great, it comes with Doc and Duke, as well as Firox. Doc is my favorite character. I Love Firox, the orange color is really stunning. I love the orange crystals too, and Firox can eat them. You can fit two of the big ones in his mouth.
Firox was much much smaller then I expected, he only goes up to about the Mini-Figs shoulders. At first I was dissappointed, but now I like him small. He's so cute to!

Overall: The Thunder Driller is awesome. If you want a Power Miners set, I suggest you get this one. Even though it is $30, all the grand pieces you get in it make up for it. I really really do love it!
One thing I forgot to mention, a lot of people complain it doesn't work on tile, but mine does. It's not as good as on carpet, but it still works. I also love the independent wheels on the back. (By ""independant"" I mean one can spin, while the other one isn't. There connected to two seperate rods) 


I really really hope you get it, you will not be disappointed!
I hope this review was helpful!

"IlovePowerMiners","2009-01-22T14:58:00.653Z","Crystal Clear Fun... (Crystal- HaHa)","I bought this set with my $30.00 that I got at Christmas, (actually, I got $35.00, and spent the rest on taxes). I like Firox, because he's my favorite color (and the fastest rock monster). It comes with two miners (Don and Duke). I heard you can find it on Ebay for $20.00. the set comes with two crystals, and a pickax, a walkie- talkie, and some dynamite.

"Mark_Bellis","2009-01-31T11:52:03.043Z","The best Power Miners set","Building the Set: The important thing to remember during the build is to keep all the axles and gears turning freely.  This is the only thing that I thought was missing from the instructions - a picture of a free turning axle used to be in the instructions of every Technic set.  It is important for making the drill work well and the wheels turn well on most surfaces when you're finished.  Very smooth surfaces such as tiles, laminate floors or window sills, might show some wheel slip but it's fine on carpet, sofa, knee, bed or anywhere with some grip.

The one issue I had with the build was that the exhaust pipes (cones and clips) are fragile but they are also at the centre of gravity of the model, the very place where you would naturally grip it to pick it up.  This means that either the exhaust pipes move or fall off, or the model slips out of your hand easily.

The body strength is not the best because the compartment sides are not rigidly attached to the central bulkhead.  It could do with some lime green corner plates here (they appeared in 3 sets in 2005).

Play Value: Spinning drill, moving wheels, opening compartment with room for figures, monster and crystals, flexible rear ladder cover, crystal-eating monster with mouth big enough for two crystals.  Bettered for functions only by the most expensive set in the range, which is twice the price.  Therefore this set is better for functions per pound.

Value for money: Â£19.55 in the UK for 250 parts (234 plus extra small ones) is 7.82 pence per piece.  This is less than the price per piece of most franchise sets.  The 11 big wheel and drill pieces and the three big compartment pieces push up the price per piece but it is not too high for the parts that are in the set.  For the seasoned LEGO builder, this is a set to buy if you have some idea of how you will use the large pieces in your own models later.

Parts Usefulness and Interest: This set earns the highest score for parts usefulness.  When first seeing a set like this from the outside, one often expects the big parts to be useful only for one thing.  Happily this is not the case with the drill and wheel parts in this set.  Someone in the LEGO company must have had fun when they designed these parts because they are interesting from the outside but also useful from the inside!

The wheel parts have a ring of 48 teeth inside, which are used with three 16-tooth cogs in the set to make the drill contra-rotate.  The wheel parts have particular interest for Technic fans because they can be used with other combinations of cogs, such as 12-24-12 and 20-8-20, to make different gear ratios for epicyclic and automatic gearboxes.  This is the best innovation in gear design since the Hailfire Droid wheel.  This set has the best combination of the new Power Miners parts, having equal numbers of the two wheel parts (5 of each).  You would otherwise need to buy 8959 and two of 8961 to get four of each.

I like the way some other useful parts are included.  The 3-lobe axle joiners that hold the side pods have many uses.  The dynamite piece can have clips attached to its 3 lobes.  There is also a new 9-long axle.  The usual mix of clips and brackets is included.  It's nice to see a range of bricks in lime green - it's easier to use the special parts in a colour when there is a good range of the basic parts too.

On technical merit alone, I have never looked forward to purchasing a set more than I have this one.  I hope the LEGO company continues to innovate to bring out sets with such useful parts every year.

Watch out for pictures of gearboxes using these parts on my Brickshelf!

"knuclear200x","2009-02-17T01:15:03.25Z","It's Just what we've always needed. A Giant Drill (that will pierce the heavens)!","Feeling sad that I've missed out on the Rock Raiders line years ago, release of this new series was a big relief.

One thing that caught my attention was the giant drill featured on the box. and with the size of that box, I just had to add it to my collection someday.

Then just a week before today TRU had a sale on this baby and finally bought it.

As many experienced buyers know, the package inside is never as big as the box. But any bigger means we'd pay a lot more.

Pros:
It has a nice rounded shape. Its other cool feature is the big drill that rotates when you roll the front wheels. Other good things, are the searchlights on top of the vehicle with the transparent round disks. The wheels are also cool with their jagged points, and the front mud guards are an awesome touch. The minifigs' headgear also looks nice with their...uh...fictional explorer-like design and use goggles instead of those crescent shaped visors. And you even get two orange crystal pieces. And once again, the drill. It's bigger than the Rock Raiders' drill. Not shiny-silver, but color doesn't matter.

Cons:
The cockpit in the rear is barely coverd by the two ladder pieces, but is not really an eyesore. Another strange thing, is that the drill doesn't have a pointed end. This was probably to avoid those who were a little prone to poking themselves in the eye. The rock creature it comes with is cute, but a little boring. Needs something like the rock gorilla that came with some of the Rock Raiders sets.

Buts:
Luckily, the set comes with the small grey cones so that you can attach one to the peg at the end of the drill, making it perfect. And even more perfect if you have one of those small harpoons. It sticks out a little though but perhaps there are better pieces to use.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The contra-rotating drill mechanism is very nice, and there is a very nice selection of parts in the set ... it's just a shame that lime green is such a difficult colour to reuse in other MOCs.

"Tri_pod_king","2009-06-30T15:34:39.077Z","Drilling with thunder!","I know, that title was kind of corny, but we're not here to discuss review titles, now are we? We're here to review this magnificent set, the Thunder Driller. There a lot of great things about this set, and no bad things that come to mind. I'll start off with the size. It's a pretty large piece of machinery, and comparing with how overpriced some Lego sets are (I'm not sayin' names), I'd say this would be worth you money. If you can get it at a discount price, that'd be even better! But yah, it's big.
      The next thing that jumped out at me were the bulky wheels. They're fantastically designed, with 'spikes' on the sides and square traction studs on the bottom/top/everywhere else that touches the ground. They're good for smashing rocks as the Thunder Driller rolls through the cave. (You know not for real, but for pretend. If you really try to smash rocks, you might end up smashing the wheel. Just sayin'.)
      Yes, there ARE stickers, but not too many, and they're really detailed, and some of them actually glow in the dark! So that's pretty cool. As usual, the minifigs' torsos and legs are printed. Unusually, their torsos are double-sided. The minifigs this year have not been disappointing as far double-sided torsos go. And while I'm on the subject, the power miner figures are overall very satisfying. They have blue rock raider helmets, and they're pretty! They have double-faced heads, one face looking confident of accomplishing whatever they want to accomplish, while the other face shows worry and fright. (Probably from either the rock monsters, or the fact that, because of the bad economy, his budget was being cut.)
          I cannot wait any longer, I'm going on to the best part of the whole set- the bad-boy drill! Now, there are two parts to the drill- the light-gray front part (part A), and the dark-gray the spiked back part (part B) which is the same part as the one used for the outer part of the wheel. Behind that is an orange studded piece which was used for the inner part of the wheel. That part doesn't spin. Now, with some fancy gear work, when the Thunder Driller moves forward, (If you're facing from the cockpit) , part A moves clockwise, while part B moves counter-clockwise, a bit slower than part A.
         Th cockpit is nothing special, with a box to fit tools in and a ladder cage-cover. The cover is flimsy and could've been better. That's probably the only con of the set, and it's not that bad.
        The set also includes two translucent-orange energy crystals and the orange rock monster Firox (Said to be the most mischievious of the rock monsters). Both crystals can fit in Firox's mouth, but it would have to be more open a bit.
          Overall thoughts: This is a very neat and detailed set and can be added onto the Thunder Driller. I highly recommend this set to any Lego lover!

"DevDevBeck","2009-06-10T13:32:34.123Z","An Amazing Lego set!","The Thunder Driller is quite a machine. It is very powerful and is very strong. It is the perfect example to show LEGO's ingenuity within the design.

The Thunder Driller is very big, about 9 inches by 6 inches, and it is around 5 Inches high. There are four massive wheels, as well as some floodlights. In the back there is a little area where there is some equipment, a boiler, and a really good place to put your Power Miners Minifigs. The roof has some chains on it, some control panels, and some floodlights, and underneath the roof, there is a small control room where the control mechanism is and where the driver can sit. (I put a yellow chair in there). Even the stickers are detailed! They have rough surfaces.

The most obvious thing about the set is the drill which truly is remarkable! I don't want to talk about how it spins but the Axle spins which turns a bunch of gears which, ultimately ends up turning the drill. Plus, the drill spins in two different ways! The dark Grey part and the Light Grey part spin in opposite directions from each other.

The minifigures are great. One of them is Doc, who is the leader of the Power Miners, and the other minifigure is Duke, the veteran. The third minifigure is a rock Monster called Firox. He is a normal rock monster that is orange in place where the others are Red, Blue, Green, Sulfur Green. I think you can store two crystals in his mouth, if you order them strategically.

Overall, I give this set a 5/5 because it is quite a marvel and a great example of LEGO's cleverness. If you can find this set it all, buy it. It won't be around for much longer.

First off, I don't feel like wasting time on the minifigs, so I'll cut to the chase. The minifigs are all the same anyway. You get the set for the big machine!
So to begin with, I must say it isn't much. It doesn't have much detail and is just kind of goofy looking. The driver can't see out, but there is a screen, so he can see where he's going. There also isn't the rool cage piece, but instead there is a ladder connected to a gate to make a ""roll cage."" The cockpit also includes a box for dynamite, and for some reason fire spewing out at the driver. 
The middle section is hollow. Here you can store crystals, miners, monsters, or whatever you can manage to fit inside. I'll also comment about those ever-so-much-loved wheels. Yes they can roll on hard surfaces, not just carpet. The middle also includes a pair of engines (I guess their engines). Not much to say about them. The top also has two lamps and some detail. The fenders on the wheels also show off the 5 showing how big it is for the first wave sets. 
Now onto the drill. Here's how the complex thing works. The front wheels are connected with a gear toward the middle of the shaft. When the wheels turn, the gear on the shaft spins a verticle-facing gear. This gear is also on a shaft with another gear on the top. The gear on the top spins another gear (so many gears there are) facing forward. That gear is on a shaft running all the way through the drill. That shaft has a gear in the first drill section. The gear then spins two gears on it's side which roll along teeth on the inside of the first drill piece making it spin in the opposite direction. The second drill piece is locked in place and spins with the shaft.
And that's really all. I give it a 5/5 mainly for the playability factor, but the smooth outward design only gets around 4/5. Overall I say to wait on this set, unless you have $20.00 to blow.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

As a mechanical engineer I knew at once, how the counter-rotating drill would work. But I wondered how they built this. Well, this part is new and excellent.

The new dynamite is cool in comparison to the printed tiles before.

The build was very simple. It didnt talk very long for me to build it. But it was a fun build. 

First off this is a good sized set for $30.00 I also like the colors. Im glad it came with 2 minifigs also. 

Pros:
Good price for size
Colors
Big Wheels
Big Drill
2 minifigs
Firox (orange rockmonster)
2 orange crystals
Top Opens
Axe
2 dynamite sticks
New peices
2 lights

Best Feature:
The opposite spinning drill

Cons:
stickers (although they do look good)
no place to hold the dynamite sticks
maybe a few more crystals
the axe is big for the crate

So now you might be wondering why I called this a hook
BECAUSE IT WILL HOOK YOU ON POWER MINERS LIKE IT HOOKED ME!
THIS IS A GREAT SET!
AND IT WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO BUY MORE!

"commandercody9520","2009-08-07T13:58:23.577Z","Favorite LEGO set so far.","as my title says,this is the most succesful LEGO set i have ever got. it's really just as sturdy as it looks on the box, unlike the AT-TE. the drill works amazingly well. the cabin is really nice, and i've always been a sucker for rock monsters.now for the pros and cons.

pros:the rock monster.  the sturdiness of the vehicle.   the power miner ""duke"".
the cool energy crystals.  the new dynamite. the wheels.  the drill.  the little cabin.   the driver's cabin.  the lamps.

cons:the miner ""doc"" is ugly.

since i only have one (unimportant) con, and a decent number of pros, i give this 100%.if you are a power miners fan, it should be a first pick, and even if you're not, you should still buy it.

"frostlass","2009-10-18T22:22:06.92Z","Power Miners rolling out to the rescue!","          This is one of the most fit power miners set I've built!

              thunder driller structure: This set is pretty well designed for playing! If you push the thunder driller back and forth, the massive drill has two sections of the drill that spin clockwise and counter-clockwise depending on the way you push it.But the awkward thing is that in the back is in the cockpit where the fire is.Why would a miner (Doc in this case) sit right in the smack back of a flame?I would think that a miner who sits back there would need heave duty gear of some sort.This set is also really nice for putting miners in the front cockpit because there is a lot of room inside.

        Minifigs:minifigs are always avalible in every set of power miners.In this one there are Doc and Duke Minifigs.In other sets you'll find the Rex, Brains, and some other power miners minifigs.There are also the rock monster minifigs.You can find Firox, Boulderax, Sulfurix, Glaciator, and Meltrox. In this set, you will find Firox, the orange rock monster.The other monsters you can find in the other sets. In the new 2009 sets, you can find even bigger rock monsters! Their names are Geolix, Tremorox, and of course, the crystal king!

           Also, I recommend this set to any power miners fan there is out there!

The build is very easy, but fun. It`s nice to watch the set form and take shape. It`s really cool to add on the giant wheels and the nifty drill, too.
The set looks very cool. It has these huge wheels that make a cool sound when you move it, and the vehicle moves, so does the drill. It looks great, and it`s fun to drill things and make the awesome sounds.
Playability is great, too! It`s fun to make the rock monster attack the Thunder Driller. Then, the two Power Miners fend of Firox and take the two crystals back to base! Just rolling the Thunder Driller around is great fun, and there`s some great play value in those rock monsters!
Overall, a fantastic set. I love it!
Pros:
Rock Monster
Two more Power Miners
TWO crystals!
Big wheels
Cool vehicle
Drill moves when wheels roll
Cons:

Minifigs: firox is really great and really rare. His orange crystals are fabulous, and I have four, since two come with crystal sweeper. Duke is fabulous also, with the soot around his eyes. Doc is actually surprisingly cool as well, with the star on his shirt. 5/5

Price: $30.00 is reasonable. No complaints there. The box is a good size, too. Nice and thick. 5/5 

Build: When I opened the box and found that there were bags labeled 1 and 2, I was confused, because the set is only one main part. It worked out okay, though. The drill mechanism is excitingly complex. 5/5 

Set itself: Best power miners set by far. It looks cool, the drill works fabulously, and did I mention it looks cool? The wheels are the best part with the disk piece for added thickness. (that sounded wrong.) the cockpit is supposed to be in the back underneath the ladder, but there is more room inside the actual machine, which has a roof that lifts off, so i put the white-and-black stick shift pieces in there. 5/5.

Playability: Great. you think firox is going to be an easy match for the giant drill, but he can do some pretty neat things if you are creative. the wheels roll  nicely, too. they make a satisfying clicking sound on linoleum tiles. 5/5

overall: 25/25. get off your computer this minute and go buy this set. Go. Now. Do it. Seriously. Right now. log off and BUY THIS SET!   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

6. Great and rare figures, plus two crystals!

Cons:

2. Hard to prop minifigures on ladder

Good set, 4/5 is my rating. The only hard part of the build would be the drill (Detail and pricise locating is very important). A parent should help with this. I recommend this set to anyone! 
3. Just a Firox? kind of hard to fight a Thunder Driller with just a small rock monster. Throwing Monster would've been better, but oh well.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"tomalphin","2014-01-16T14:08:24.26Z","Boring construction, fragile model, cool drill.","<p><strong>About me:</strong> I am an AFOL who has been building at least 1 set each year for my whole life. I build most sets under 500 pieces as a &quot;puzzle build&quot;, without using the instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Initial impressions:</strong> Since this was one of many models from an unsorted craigslist purchase,&nbsp;I just built it quickly with the instructions.&nbsp; I am fond of the green color used throughout the power miners set, but this model&nbsp;didn&#39;t excite me much.&nbsp; The only distinguishing feature is the giant&nbsp;drill.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building experience:</strong> The building process was boring to me.&nbsp; I don&#39;t like the use of huge hull pieces to give the overall shape of the model, and the brickwork felt haphazard and unattractive.&nbsp; I also had a consistent problem of the spout pieces falling off as I assembled the model, since the two &quot;engine&quot; parts would bump into it during assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Finished Model:</strong> The finished model isn&#39;t that attractive to me.&nbsp; that said, I think that linking the drill rotation to the wheels makes for a fun play feature.&nbsp;Big chunky parts dominate the build, so it doesn&#39;t feel like a good parts set, and the finished model isn&#39;t interesting to an adult.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> 5/10 on a 10-point scale.&nbsp; Lego group can do better.</p>
