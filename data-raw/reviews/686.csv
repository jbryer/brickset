There is no moving piston or any other functionality. This set is from 1985, when the small engine cylinder blocks did not yet exist and the set is too small to fit the big 2x2 piston block in its engine.

When comparing this set with other sets from that era, I must say this one looks very good. Its design is sturdy, balanced and well thought out. There is not really any way of improving this set with the bricks which were available back then, which means the LEGO design department has done an excellent job.

Given the year it was released and its pricetag (I believed I got it back then for the equivalent of about $5-$6), this set is a solid 5/5. It was one of my favourite sets when I was a small kid.
