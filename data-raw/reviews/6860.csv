"water_jedi_17","2008-12-08T20:05:39.14Z","Look familiar??","For those of you who read my Soldier’s arsenal review, you may have heard how I noted that it looked similar to The Knight impulse set. After careful examination, I noticed this set has the sam design as the Batcycle in 7886. 
The minifigs: The power miner has a blue vest and blue legs with various tool drawn on them, simlar to the Iny fig. He also comes with a new helmet which is a new piece.  The monster is something new with red energy seeping through it’s body.The arms are larger versions of minifig arms that can hold crystals(as seen in the box drawing) It’s mouth is big enough to swallow a crystal, which seems  to be the main function of the monsters.
The stone chopper as I said, is loosely based on the Batcycle. One major difference is the buzz saws on front which dig through the dirt. The two light fixtures on the sides are actually red diamonds(which theocratically power the vehicle) The miner can easily hold on to the front handles which again is similar to the cycle.
Overall, this set lacks creativity with pieces changed and/or added. The new minifigs are fine for a set of this size but I think this line is not great as I hoped. This set is great to make an army of miners and I recommend it to those who want to experiment with the line to decide whether or not larger sets should be bought.
Pros:
lime green technic(great for bionicle MOCs)
rock monster AND miner
essential army builder
Cons
Same design as Batcycle(repeated design)

Stone Chopper
Pros: The blades will spin quite well if properly positioned. It comes with one of those engine pieces too. Certain stickers are textured and will glow in the dark!

Cons: It's limited pieces means that there is little room for creativity without adding some pieces.

Meltrox
Pros: Has poseable arms, and can swallow up to two crystals.

"Rgijaba","2009-02-04T15:29:16.92Z","A red Energy Crystal?! I thought I'd never see the day...","That, for me, at least, is the best part of this odd drill bike. For anyone who needs a red Energy Crystal for their Rock Raiders collection, go to this inexpenceive Power Miners set! It includes Meltrox and Rex, I think is his name. The stone choper its self is modled after the Recon Bike (I think that was what it was called) in the Crystal Miner (MT-101 Mobile Mining Unit, Rhino One) Mars Mission set. This one has an all terain-style wheel and some orange saw blades to cut through rocks with. It has a small engine brick for decoration (if it was real, power) that I assume isn't too common. It has a place on the side to put a small, red crystal, and, if these are Energy Crystals, to power it. After all, the only reason these crystals are being mined is so that those Rock Monsters can't eat them and cause earth quakes. But the concept of a saw bike just seems a bit unusual to me, I just don't see how it could work out very well. I can't imagine it moving very fast to even be able to get to a place where it was needed, but whatever. So it is a small, fairly good, cheap set you can go buy to give your self something to do.

I thought the set wuld be slightly taller than the average minifigure motorcycle. I was so wrong. It was 2 to 3 times larger that I expected. The minifigure made it look even bigger on it. I took out a lego car and lego police cars when I got home. That was when I realized the set was as big as a LEGO car. Placing the Stone chopper next to the thunder driller makes the thunder driller even bigger. You can place a minifigure on it and a passenger standing beind the driver.

The design of the min fig body is very good! it is printed back and front! Good job on the design! The min fig heads now have dual faced expressions! One normal and you twist it and you have a frightend face expression! Rock monster:The mini rock monster are good figs to have as well! I like how they come in different colours!

They were also on sale at the time, so how could I pass it up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is small and cheap, two things that budget conscious LEGO Enthusiasts are always on the lookout for. The build is fairly simple, but it uses techniques that some might not enjoy or find very fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vehicle is built using Technic and Regular LEGO pieces, stickers are included for some detail work, the combination of green and orange also isn't for everybody, however I think it's bold and stands out. The Mini-Figure has double-sided printing for the face if memory serves, a regular expression and a frightened expression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meltrox the Rock Monster is a combination of dark grey and transparent reds, he consists of two pieces, the head and the torso, which is hollow inside to store the ruby crystal inside to give the creature a power boost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Themes go the Power Miners are an interesting addition to most any LEGO display, the creatuers can be aliens or subterranean beasts lured out by the miners. I'm not as familiar with this style of Theme as opposed to the more traditional ones, but I do find them to be enjoyable. And this set is quite the good value if you're looking for cheap alternative builds with Technic pieces, or unique Mini-Figures. As a bonus all of the Power Miners themselves include hats that can use all those spare visors you'll be picking up from the Space Police 3 sets. (If you collect both.) The multi-colored crystal pieces are nice too.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

The bike is ok, but is better on carpet.&nbsp; Overall, I recommend this set as a supplement to other PM sets.&nbsp; Thanks for reading!",FALSE,5,4,4,4,5
"Trueblox","2019-04-21T21:31:31.153Z","A nice starter to the best Lego series ever.","<p>Hello, it&#39;s me, Trueblox, and wow, has it been a while since i made my last review. Anyways, im here to review set 8956, Stone Chopper from the Power miners series.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This time, i don&#39;t own the box for the set. Big oof. But, the instructions shows the front box art, and it has some extra art at the end, plus the combo builds. This set can combine with the Mine Mech.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build:</p>

<p>The build looks quite nice, i gotta say. The Stone Chopper looks good for a cheap set. The Stone Chopper has 2 spots on each side where you can place crystals.</p>

<p>The figures:</p>

<p>First off we have Meltrox, the red rock monster. The top of his head can open, where you can put a crystal (or even a dynamite bomb) inside.</p>

<p>The Power Miner, which is Duke, is my least favorite version of Duke, but he&#39;s still an amazing figure, heck, it&#39;s one of my most favorite figures overall. (All Power Miners figures are my favorites) He sports a helmet without goggles and has a sleeveless vest with blue overalls.</p>

<p>The play feature:</p>

<p>The play feature is simple. You move the Stone Chopper forwards, the little cutters in the front move like a tire. Like i said, it&#39;s simple, but effective for a small toy.</p>

<p>Overall opinion: Get this set. It&#39;s cheap, plus, you can get a taste of what Power Miners is, and maybe you&#39;ll also like the series, like me! And also, expect another review from me, this time, from the biggest set of all... That comes from Power Miners. Anyways,&nbsp; see you all later, and have a nice day!</p>

<p>The Figures, &#39;&#39;Beard stubble guy&#39;&#39; as Brickset and Bricklink, Is a pretty generic miner. But i like the designs of the Power Miners.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Little Rock Monster Guy is great. I love these figures. They just look fun! They can eat a Power crystal too. Or dynamite, i remember seeing one of those ads for this theme with a Rock Monster eating dynamite haha.</p>

<p>Building this was pretty simple and quick, took 2 to 3 minutes. Not much Annoying technic stuff.</p>

<p>For the parts we have a handlebar, some Technic axles, Wheels, Blades, Those funny technic wheels, Exclusive to this set in orange. Also Engine thingy, Red diamond and crystal.</p>

<p>The Stone Chopper itself is a small but great looking motorcycle, With a decent play feature. When you push it the Blades spin and chops through rocks i guess?. Simple but solid function.</p>

<p>The Original Value of this thing is maybe a dollar too much. PPP Is alright. It&#39;s very cheap to get used now however.</p>

<p>So overall this is just a solid little set! Not much wrong here.</p>
