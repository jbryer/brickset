"TheDarkKnight","2008-12-16T21:50:34.483Z","Fantastic!","Well, there's no way that my review can top the review of VoyaNui36, so I'm just gonna tell you what I think.

I think this game is the best LEGO game produced, and one of the best games ever to hit the market.

I think Nightwing's hair is ridiculous.

I think it's about time we got this game. The sets have only been in production for about three years, jeez.

I think they finally made Robin cool, but still stupid. (EPIC WIN!)

I think Bagirl, Clayface, Man-Bat, Killer Croc, Jim Gordon, and all of the character costume variations should all be available to the public as minifigures within the next two years.

I think the charcters, the storyline, and the design were well thought out and deserve a lot of credit.

I think this is the end of my review.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2009-06-29T02:23:57.843Z","""This City Deserves a Better Class of Criminal, and I'm Gonna Give it to 'em."" - The Joker","This game, in my opinion, has set forth many unprecedented ideas and concepts of any lego game made so far and as lego games have evolved over the years this game has reached that pinnacle. 

In Lego Batman, the scene is set as all the criminal masterminds have escaped from Arkam Asylum and banded together, divided amongst three major criminal leaders. Included in this major three(in episode order) are The Riddler, The Penguin, and my personal favorite The Joker. As the player enters each round, he is faced with tackling major obstacles in attempt to progress through to the boss at the end of each level. Each level loads with a backround story of the particular boss in hero mode. As the gamer progresses through the episode defeating many bosses, he gains more and more clues that help him solve the mystery of where the leader is located. The last level of an episode is the climatic battle between batman and the leader villain. After the episode has been beated the gamer may choose to replay the episode only this time playing on the villain side tackling a whole new storyline. Characters, extras, and interesting data may be purchased from either the batcave or arkam asylum. 

As the player goes through each level in hero mode, he/she will need the help of different suits to accomplish and solve different puzzles. Suits may be changed by walking the character through a buildable platform that corresponds to either batman or robin according to the insignia on the platform. Other interesting features include bonus levels Wayne Manor and Arkam Asylum. 

This game to me stands out different from the other lego games. It is a lot more interesting and challenging which doesn't surprise me considering it's batman. I think that of all the lego games out there, this one you shouldn't pass up. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Jedisquidward","2011-02-05T23:14:55.237Z","Such an underrated game right in the same series as such an overrated game.","Critics say Lego Batman is a poorly made game.<br>Critics are lying.<br><br>Lego Batman is a great game and in my opinion,(Remember, this was made in early 2011 and I haven't played Indiana Jones 2, Harry Potter, or Battles) the best game in the Lego series.<br><br>The graphics are good. Although they can be a bit dark sometimes, I believe the developers purposely did this to set the dark mood of Gotham. I mean, do you want them to choose the BATMAN AND ROBIN style Gotham City? No, you don't.<br><br>The gameplay is like the other Lego games, but the gameplay style of the Lego games are great! It would have been nice to make the 2 last unlockable characters Indiana Jones and Darth Vader, but that would be asking for the moon.<br><br>I am switching the parts to camera. It is automatic, and it gets the job done.. most of the time. Sometimes you couldn't see where you wanted to go, and because of the camera, sometimes you would and wouldn't know where a platform was.<br><br>I am switching the building experience to controls. They are good. Something I find with games today is that instead of using all different buttons to preform certain commands, they use button combinations. This luckily does not have any of those as far as I can recall. There were motion controls for attacking, but they were optional. I never used that option, so I don't know how well it works.<br><br>The characters are all unique and colorful. Although this has the least characters of the 3 Lego games I own, almost every character had their own special power. But it was annoying on free play mode switching through all the Batman and Robin Suits.<br><br>There are two modes of this game. The first one is hero mode, and the second is villain mode. But more on that later. On hero mode you would play as batman and robin on every level. TLC chose the light gray suit batman for his suit, and I really wish they had gone with the black version. It would have been nice to be able to change the main batman suits, so you could play as whichever one from the sets you liked most.<br><br>The second version is Villain mode. These are the same places from the villains point of view. But these were entirely new levels. The first person would be the guest of the level, and the second player would always be the team leader. There are 3 teams of vilains in the game, each with 3 members, a partner, and a leader. The leaders were the Riddler, the Penguin, and the Joker. With all modes included, there are a grand total of 32 levels.<br><br>I would definitely reccomend this game, especially since the price has dropped with the release of more Lego games.<br>",TRUE,4,2,4,5,3

"Berrus_Brickus","2011-11-24T20:00:53.847Z","Gotham is falling to pieces... (official tagline)","<p>I picked this up on my trip to LEGOLAND California back in May. So far, out of all of the games produced by <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Traveller's_Tales"">Traveller's_Tales</a>, it is my second favorite LEGO videogame. It would be my favorite if it wasn't for a small amount of playable characters, and even a smaller amout of characters that I <em>want</em> to play as.</p>
<h4>Value for Money</h4>
<p><br/>I bought this game for Wii at LEGOLAND's Big Shop. I bought it for $20 USD, which it still sells for. That is a great price, as most console games sell for at least $50 when they are first released</p>
<h4>Instruction Manual/Packaging</h4>
<p><br/>I'm actually not usually fond of the packaging on LEGO games, and this one isn't an exception. First of all, <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Robin"">Robin</a> winking is a little strange, but I guess that it would make it look even kid friendlier. The choice of villains on the rooftops seems a little weird too, <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Freeze"">Mr. Freeze</a> has a very small role. I do like the back of the case though, with a bat-symbol on the top and several screen shots of different characters. There is also a picture of <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Poison_Ivy"">Poison Ivy</a> and <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/The_Riddler"">The Riddler</a> against a dark blue skyline of Gotham City&nbsp; The instruction manual is incomplete, and even has a mistake in it. It goes over the hero gameplay pretty well, except for <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Alfred"">Alfred</a> (who narrates the manual) says to look out for blue sparks on magnetic walls. The problem with that? Almost <em>all </em>of the magnetic walls have blue sparks, and they don's harm Robin or <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Nightwing"">Nightwing</a> (the only two characters who can climb them) at all. It goes over the villain abilites horribley though. It only has two - mind control and super strengh - which are used by The Riddler and <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Clayface"">Clayface</a> on the first villain level. There are advertisements for Police, Mars Mission, Racers, and the 2008 Batman sets in the back of the manual. Despite this, the manual could of been a lot worse. The manual for <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/LEGO_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean%3A_The_Video_Game"">LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game</a> only had one or two pages.</p>
<h4>Playability/Replay Value</h4>
<p><br/>It took me either six days, or 13 days (I can't remember which) to complete everything (story and 100%). That is not a long time at all to complete the videogame, but I've played it again several times, mostly because it's short, so I keep replaying it because I find it hard to believe that it's over. No, it's not <em>that</em> good, it's mostly because there isn't that much to buy with only a small range of good characters (I don't want to play as Police Officers, Goons, or Janitors). A couple other problems I have are that in every hero level, you only use Batman and Robin. Would it of killed them to throw <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Batgirl"">Batgirl</a> or Nightwing? I would of liked another level in each of the stories too, to bring it up from 5 to 6, and there are some gaps in the story: Riddler's Revenge for Heroes could of used a level where you fight only <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Two-Face"">Two-Face</a>, not in his truck, and not alongside the Riddler, the villain version of RR lacks a vehicle level, Batman doesn't fight <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Bane"">Bane</a> or <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/The_Scarecrow"">The Scarecrow</a> (outside of vehicles), and there is no mission where you control <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Mad_Hatter"">Mad Hatter</a> or <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Man-Bat"">Man-Bat</a>. The villain levels also only have a couple bosses, and only one isn't a vehicle, again, throw in Batgirl or Nightwing. Despite this, the playability is great. The minikits are usually hidden very well, and the red bricks even better. I really do enjoy the super suit upgrades, even though I don't like all of the super suits (especially the magnet one, which is just annoying).</p>
<h4>Characters</h4>
<p><br/>Again, there aren't that many characters on console versions of the game (even though the DS version is packed), but the characters that there are are great, at least the ones worth using. It does get a little boring in freeplay, because you always have at least Batman (or Batgirl), Robin (or Nightwing), <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/The_Joker"">The Joker</a>, <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/The_Penguin"">The Penguin</a>, Poison Ivy, and Mr. Freeze. I only have&nbsp;a couple&nbsp;problems with certain characters not having certain abilities; Mr. Freeze doesn't have heat immunity and Batgirl can't bypass guards like other female characters can.</p>
<h4>Graphics</h4>
<p><br/>I don't really care about a videogame's graphics, so I automatically have it a 4 for not being as glitchy as other games (like <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/LEGO_Indiana_Jones_2%3A_The_Adventure_Continues"">LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues</a> and LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game).</p>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p><br/>Before I get to the final thoughts, there are a couple things that I'd like to say:<br/></p>
<p>The story is a little messed up, and I don't mean in relation to any Batman continuity, I mean as a stand alone game, the continuity is messed up. Especially in [[The Penguin]]'s story.<br/></p>
<p>The data section was a nice way to add background on characters, vehicles, and Gotham City and gives something to spend studs on, as there aren't a lot of characters, and most of them aren't very expensive (the only expensive on is <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Ra's_Al_Ghul"">Ra's Al Ghul</a>). It does seem&nbsp; a little bit like it's mocking me by mentioning characters that you can't play as, like <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Ventriloquist_and_Scarface"">Ventriloquist and Scarface</a>, <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Azrael"">Azrael</a>, and <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Talia_Al_Ghul"">Talia Al Ghul</a>.</p>
<p>Any way, even if this review sounds negative, I did enjoy this game and would recomend it for the $20 it sells for. This is my second favorite LEGO game (produced by Traveller's Tales) behind <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter%3A_Years_1-4""><em>LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</em></a> (I have yet to play 5-7), if this game had a wider selection of characters, it might of even surpassed that! I am really looking forward to the game's sequel, <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/LEGO_Batman_2%3A_DC_Super_Heroes"">LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes</a>, especially if it expands upon the diverse world of Batman heroes and villains.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T15:40:52.09Z","I Am Batman!","<p>LEGO Batman The Video Game: My first exposure to LEGO Video Games was the LEGO Star Wars title. I enjoyed the heck out of that game, and even though these games are fairly simple to play and beat they give you an aweful lot of fun for your money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reviewing a game can be a bit different from reviewing an ordinary LEGO Set, by now I think the formula of a LEGO Video Game from TT is pretty much universally understood and known, so instead of wasting time covering game basics let's discuss the reasons why this game is a must have for any LEGO Batman fan. (Or LEGO Video Game fan.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all these titles offer the opportunity to spend some quality time with your children(Nieces, Nephews, Grandchildren, Younger Cousins.) they allow you to share the adventure and the excitement of playing a game with LEGO Mini-Figures doing things that no ordinary Mini-Figure can ever do. You get to see them in action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, in a gaming world full of constant war time simulations, racing titles, role playing fantasies and adventure or platforming games these titles offer a fun diversion from the overall seriousness of games designed for older players. And sometimes you just need to get away from all of those violence ridden titles (or frustrating as sin titles) and just unwind with a nice relaxing romp through the LEGO Universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These titles offer up that needed bit of fun. And as a bonus they allow you to enjoy your LEGO Sets in a whole new way. On the television screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The premise of the game is to defend Gotham against crime, or destroy it with your criminal plan while playing in the villains side of the stories. Unlike the Star Wars titles the stories in this game are not based on any particular thing, which is somewhat unfortunate because I wouldn't mind having witnessed Michel Keaton's old films in LEGO style, but at least we're spared the stupidity of Batman &amp; Robin in LEGO form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The storylines for each official chapter are quite interesting and full of typical LEGO brand humor, the game is also much more challenging than the Star Wars titles, I still haven't finished getting all of the Mini-Kits or Red Bricks yet. The featured characters are impressive and numerous, but there is something I miss from the Star Wars games... The ability to use the Force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the abilities of certain characters are rather ingenious actually, but shaking down Gotham Criminals with the Force would have been neat, I can understand though the licensing nightmare it would have been to include bonus Mini-Figures carried over from other LEGO Video Game franchises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the highlight of this game though is the classic Danny Elfman Batman theme, had they gone with the more recent Nolan Batman films theme it wouldn't have been near as much fun, but running around defeating Gotham Criminals while Elfman's score plays in the background is worlds of fun and almost makes it feel like the stories in this game could be an extension of the Tim Burton era Batman films.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this game is worth owning. It's fun (Like I haven't said that enough yet.), it offers up a change of pace from the Star Wars titles and it can be somewhat more challenging than the earlier titles. Traveler's Tales has been steadily improving upon their base game design. Some critics feel that this genre can be too simplistic or easy, but I say that this genre can only get better the more titles they bring out. So how about a LEGO Batman 2 guys? Or maybe a LEGO Castle game based on this similar engine?</p>",TRUE,5,1,5,5,5
