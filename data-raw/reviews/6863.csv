"bmwlego","2008-09-27T06:49:42.043Z","Excellent Addition to LEGO Video Games-If you like LEGO Star Wars games, pick this one up!","I bought this game when it launched this past Tuesday and couldn't wait to play it. While I was considering which version to buy (PS2, Wii or DS) I learned that the PS2 and Wii games are basically the same. With the Wii you have to do a lot of moving around to control your character/vehicle. I wanted a game where I could just sit and relax so I chose the PS2 version (it is $20 cheaper which enabled me to buy LEGO at Toys R Us!).

The cut scenes are beautiful, clever and &quot;LEGO funny&quot;! There are many characters that you can control and you can be a hero or a villain. Not only can you control different character but many vehicles as well. There are hidden items and loose bricks that you can put together to build items that help you advance in the game. I love the City theme and for me, the best part of the game was seeing LEGO City models in Gotham City. The new Mobile Police Command truck is in the game, the Coast Guard Helicopter and of course the 1st wave of Batman vehicles are in the game as well. I have unlocked 3 suits each for Batman and Robin that have special abilities such as gliding, magnet boots that let Robin walk on metallic surfaces, a tech suit that lets Robin control a remote control car, etc. I have played and beat the first 3 levels so far and the game does not disappoint at all. You have to beat a boos at the end of each level as you collect studs to reach Hero Status and collect hidden items, switch costumes and beat up baddies along the way. I love LEGO and Batman is my favorite DC superhero so when this game was originally announced last year, I couldn't wait to get it. It is worth the wait!

I can only hope that LEGO will create minifigs of the characters that are in the game like Gordon, Clayface, etc. That would really be an intelligent promotion on their part, sort of like a Batman Battle Pack like they did for Star Wars and the Castle themes. I REALLY NEED a Gordon fig, don't you? I love these 2 properties together and can't wait to see the rest of the game's levels, cut scenes, characters and vehicles. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:

Ability to use unique-powered special suits.
Featuring almost all Batman enemies
Special powers for each characters

Cons:
None

This is an excellent game, and it also makes you think creatively, because sometimes you can only pass an area if you use your brain.

TT Games has made lots of good Lego games in the past, and now they have the 5th game.

GOOD:
Every Villain from the ""Universe"" of Batman; They include Man-Bat, Mad Hatter, Clayface, and More!

Great Graphics

Different suits for the same character like the Destruction Suit for Batman and the Tech Suit for Robin.

BAD:
I don't know yet.

OVERALL:
I don't have any other things to give my opinion on, but I hope to complete the chapters/episodes and write my Post-Completed Game Review soon!

So far, from my point of view:
5/5

10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
