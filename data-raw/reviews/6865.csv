"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-27T20:57:46.64Z","Finally, a video game based on my favourite theme.","When I got my first Batman sets, (Catwoman Pursuit and Hunt for Killer Croc on the same day) I thought: &quot;Finally, my two greatest loves combined. Batman and Lego, together at last.&quot; And now I have the video game to go along with my sets. This game features a brand-new soryline featuring all of the characters from the actual sets, plus a few who aren't part of the theme YET. (Hint, Lego, hintedy hint hint.) As usual there is the delightfully jovial tongue-in-cheek attitude that Lego puts in all their games, as well as the sometimes puzzling but not too difficult gameplay. A MAJOR improvement from Lego Indiana Jones is that the canisters and power bricks are MUCH more difficult to find. I say this as a good thing because I'm almost done story mode and I want to be doing Free Play for as long as possible.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
