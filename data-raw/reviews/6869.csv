"Gus_263","2009-05-30T15:12:00.607Z","A New Classic!","Introduction 

This Castle set is very different in comparison with some current sets (as a main difference, I can say that this is not a castle, but a village, which can expand the subject of Castle and aggregate it to other themes, like Town). It is possibly one of the best sets of the theme, and includes a great number of parts and mini figures, which will be discussed during the review. It was a much awaited launch in 2009, and really is a pity that it's distribution is limited to countries with Shop at Home. I got my exemplar of this set from UK, and I received it in March. Unfortunately this set will not be available in my country. I separated the review in four main parts, to be easier to read. They are Pieces, Construction, Design and Playability. 

Pieces 

The pieces are very important factors to the set's final rate. There are 1601 pieces in total, a very good range, allowing to build castles, houses, and so on. The price for it isn’t very cheap, but worth, it can even be considered ""few"" for the contents the set includes. The price per piece is very tempting to buy the set. It also has some very interesting colors such as Dark Brown, Pearl Gold, Medium Blue, and others like Tan and Dark Red, more common with the modular houses or exclusives sets. 

As a Castle set, it is important to always have accessories for the knights and to the inhabitants of the village. For the knights, there are a regular number of weapons: three spears, an axe, a lance, and two helmets, one for each knight. 

Other accessories that come in good quantity in the set are baskets, barrels, cups / chalices and the new pieces of fire, (which are curved flames). Other examples of interesting objects are: a brush, a plate, a carrot and two knives. This set also has cool parts such as apples, fish, a chest (with coins), a rat, and turkey (which is rare to see complete, as in this set). There is also a great quantity of parts of plants (14 of them!) to make the tree. But I think they could also be used as vegetation in another way, besides the tree that will be reviewed later. 

There will be used many common pieces for the structures of the houses, like bricks, plates, round bricks and round plates. As mentioned before it have interesting colors, but the most useful with this set are gray and dark gray (technically speaking, Light Bluish Gray and Dark Bluish Gray), included in many different types of pieces. There have a good quantity of bricks, some like the part listed as 30137 in Bricklink and it's derivatives, that are modified bricks which influence the design very well. The brown pieces (Reddish Brown) are included in large numbers. I believe that if those parts are applied to normal and lower houses, they may acquire a Western Sets' style. 

For the roof, many black slope pieces are used. And to keep them, there are many arches. As an essential part as well, there are many columns. There is the presence of a ladder and a door, and more than one type of windows, which is a nice addition. The set includes even ""vehicle mudguards”, that are plates / bricks with small arches commonly used in today’s cars and truck sets. Though included in a small number, they’re very useful and have interesting and great uses for the design (although they were already used with some modular houses, so don’t being that new in building of houses). 

The water wheel has a new piece (64566), which I believe can have many uses. Other news are the cows. They have a brown a little different than the bricks that are placed in their back, but nothing that affects a lot. The pieces of horn are very interesting. The only thing that comes to interfere a bit is the fact that they are smaller than the horse (also included in this set). 

But beyond these common and rare pieces, there is what to say about the mini figures. Two knights, a blacksmith, a merchant, two women and two young (one of them have smaller legs, just like as in mini figures of dwarves). Three have the same body, and the knight have the costumes / armor of the knights from the Fantasy Era (sometimes known as Crown Knights). But all have distinct characteristics, from hair to faces (eg, the same hair of Agent Trace is included in this set). And all represent well the medieval theme. Details on each of the minifigs are well balanced, which makes them useful for other themes as well, like in the City theme. One point I don’t like is the head with two faces. Such kind of head has become used many times and more commonly in various themes. Are indeed interesting, but it removes the possibility of use of other accessories than long hair and helmets. It isn’t good to put any hat in mini figures with it, or you may find a mouth ""screaming"" behind the head of it. 

So, this set is a great source of parts. Rare and common parts, new parts, mini figures in a good number (it is a regular number if compared with some previous sets), useful accessories, and everything that will provide an excellent construction and excellent design. What could be better was the organization of the pieces, they don’t come in numbered bags, and the parts of minifigs comes mixed, which means that almost all bags must be opened, making you spend a large part of the time looking for parts instead of building. Therefore, I suggest building with your family. But it takes time, even more than a set with the same number of pieces. But I do not blame the pieces for this, they are all interesting, useful and well detailed.

Construction 

Following the construction by the book of instructions, the first things to be built are the mini figures and parts from outside the house. Just like the market, the table on the outside and the tree, they are all very easy to build. I believe that there is no right way to put the flowers in the tree, because the instructions do not detail all the positions. So it’s the choice of who owns the set. The tree looks great, but the result of the building isn’t as positive. This isn’t due the design, but I think it is very fragile. It is normal that those plants seem small (or too ""flat"" to form a tree), but I think the biggest problem is the weakness of the plant and the trunk of the tree.

I think it is cool the presence of a stand of arms, though small (perhaps as small as an impulse set?), it adds more content to the set. Something really cool are three animals that can be done in a simple and fast building, with few pieces (would it be a chicken, a duck and a rooster?). This is great because it reminds a bit of set 375, where the horses were made entirely of pieces. 

Both houses are made from 2 plates (or combination of plates) for each side / part of them. The first to be built (a tan house, it isn’t that yellow as the description of S@H describes it), have a blacksmith’s shop in it’s ground floor. On the outside there is a water wheel, which have a building that was very well thought. As it moves, with a piece of propeller, a hammer can be moved well to a sword (as if shaping it after being forged in the furnace side). 

Meanwhile, on the other side of the bottom, there is not much content as this would be a stable for horses. So far, the construction of the ground floor is in most parts of arches, for internal playability. The connection between the two parts are connected by connector bricks, and above, by connector plates. In the other floor, the construction involves the most common parts, the windows and a fireplace connected directly outside the building for a chimney.  And finally, after some details (such as mudguards), begins the construction of the roof, supported by internal arches. It may seem very simple the construction of this part, but you must note the smallest details for the use of correct parts. It would be somewhat easier if the parts were adequately separated in numbered bags. After that, just add the rest of the chimney and the building of that house is finished. Then, just have to include the final details (flares, a table and a chair inside the house).

The house which predominant color is medium blue have the building’s first steps very similar. But the bottom of the house is more closed, and has a door and some windows (two are fragile, as they are connected by only 2 studs). From above also has a fireplace connected to the main building, and as differences with comparison with the another house, this has different positions of the main windows, and there is only one kind of window on this floor. Instead of a space for a water wheel, there is a space for a staircase. There is no door to this floor, something that could be really good. But anyways, the stair railing and the top of the stairs next to the entrance are very good at design. The roof again requires much attention. In this case, the arches didn’t connect themselves, but support the roof. It sometimes dismantles while it is being built, due a lack of firmness on the roof. Part of the roof becomes stronger after the plates are placed above. As in another house, it has a chimney, but when the house is open, it is in the middle of the structure. The interior is also very detailed, has a small table, a cupboard, a chair (which has no stud, and isn’t fixed on the floor) and a bed (though interesting, it has no studs, losing a bit of compatibility with the minifigs). On the ground floor there are details inside, like the barrels. This ground look like very well a tavern.

The building has some repetitions that are not true problems. The factor of open / close the houses are simple in construction, with only two connections in each home. The building certain times did not appear very strong (like the roof of the blue house) but is quite fun. I recommend that the building is done with family, due the problem of separation of parts, or else the building will continue for a long time to find the necessary parts.

The Design 

the design of the houses (and of the objects and contents as well) is pretty cool. It's all in the European style of medieval times (I just don’t know about the pearl gold color... those houses might be from people of nobility.) So, I guess that it combine well with the old Castle sets (and even some new) and with a layout of Town (maybe like in an old town). The only ""problems"" in the design would be some objects out of scale, such as the size of the turkey (which is almost the size of the children mini figure) and of the cows, which are smaller than the horse. But anyway, I guess that is common to many LEGO sets (for example, search for images of books for mini figures and see what I'm talking about), but in some ways it’s good, because being bigger, the details will become clearer.

Playability 

The Playability is fantastic! Has much to do in each of the houses! I think the playability couldn’t be better (with 8 minifigs, there is much to do!), and the set after it is built is strong enough (with the exception of the lower windows of the medium blue house and of the tree). It’s fun to play inside the house and even outside (eg. the detail of the water wheel). The tree is fragile, depending on how you hold part of it may fall. But nothing too bad, it is also good for the set. The houses are very resistant both as closed or opened.

Conclusion 

It’s a fantastic set. The playability, construction, parts and design are great. Though it have few cons (like the fragility of the tree and the separation of pieces, which is a major con), it is certainly one of the best sets of the Castle theme ever made. In my opinion is the best of today’s castle sets. Even without the same modular system of the other Modular Houses, this set is one that will be very good to be near a medieval city or layout. 5/5 is the rate I give to this set. Highly recommended for fans of LEGO Castle but also for fans of any themes of LEGO!

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Nice, as always. High-def pictures all around nice and 'shopped. The black pieces are hard to discern from the dark grey pieces in the instructions as usual.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Great. Lots of diverse pieces and accessories (including Lego poo! At least I think that's what piece 4521781 is supposed to be). Not sure I like faces on both sides of my minifigs heads since it's not usable when the hair piece isn't on.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>Pretty nice selection of characters. Not sure about Lego children still (with the short legs), but they're probably not going away any time soon. Also don't like the blonde wig included as it looks awful. It's way too big.<br><h4>The build</h4><p>Interesting accessories, as stated before. And I like the attempt at furniture. Some of it turned out really great. Why can't the city sets and creator houses have the same push? Anyway, some of the build was tedious and repetitive, but I guess to get detail and size that is a sacrifice we have to make. Some occasions with the build also resulted in incredibly flimsy set-ups causing walls and other things to collapse underneath from the pressure of having pieces added on top of them. More or less solved itself when connector pieces joined the sections together, but the end result is that the finished model is slightly ""bendy"". This is a newer complaint I have with sets when slightly too many detailed pieces are used when larger pieces would have been 
more efficient; yes I like detail, but not at the cost of stability when
 building or in areas that the user is not going to see very often.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Pretty good, if not a little shallow in terms of the width of the houses. They are sold to us on the front of the package as four roofed section houses, but closing them to make two houses just doesn't look as good. The opened four roof section just doesn't go back very far. I also worry about the amount of small accessories, not attached to any pieces getting potentially lost. Ex: placing small yellow wedge pieces (cheese) on a smooth surface.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4>Overall I'm happy with it. It's got a lot of playability, and some interesting characters running around. The furniture and detail pieces are pretty impressive. That said though, I'm not a fan of highly specialized pieces found in this set- Why make a cat, frog, or rat, but then have the user create there own duck/rooster (there are several in this set)? I guess I'm just old school and all of the shiny fish, apples, carrots, whole turkey will take some getting used to. The modernization of Lego means that where we used to use red and green cylinders for apples we now have highly detailed apples (including leaves on the stems). Glad to see that sticker decals were only used for paintings inside the buildings and for flags on the outside, and not for exterior building details like some other Castle sets. Still don't think it's priced right at $99.99. Just doesn't feel like there's enough there to justify that price. I really would love to see a spreadsheet of all the models Lego produces with a per piece price listed. Interesting to see how this one holds up.

I thought it would be nice to buy a set from another theme other than City for a change, and sure enough, I couldn't keep my eyes off this one. I got it at The Lego Store, which saved me the effort of ordering online.<div><br></div><div>This is without a doubt the most brutal build I have ever experienced. It was very unwise of me to pour all 1601 pieces into a single large pile. Finding a piece that did not come in bulk (i.e. there was only one piece of that kind and colour) took me at least 45 minutes; building the minifigures and minor parts of the set took me a solid 2 hours simply because I had such a difficult time finding pieces. However, as I went along, the build became easier and less strenuous as more pieces were being used and less remained in the pile. I gave the building experience a four because I did enjoy building every piece of this set, even though the searching was back-breaking. Lesson learned: next time I will sort the pieces into different piles to save myself trouble and time.</div><div><br></div><div>The first part you build is the minifigures. Two knights, a blacksmith, a beggar, a peasant, a child, and two maids are included. You are also given a whole heap of animals including two cows, a horse, a frog, a mouse, three types of birds, and five fish. The horse comes with a carriage carrying what seems to be two bales of hay. Accessories include a knife, 5 goblets (3 gold, 1 clear, 1 grey), four apples, a carrot, flowers, a WHOLE chicken with two drumsticks, a battle ax, three spears, a sword, a flag, a treasure chest, three large baskets, four coins, a piece of silver ore, a hairbrush, keg, and perfume. There is also a beautifully detailed tree with flowers lining the outer edge of it, a market stand with price listings, and a large table where the food is placed on.</div><div><br></div><div>The next build is the blacksmith shop/stables. The first floor houses the blacksmith shop itself. Here, there is a furnace, anvil with sword, and a hammer used to beat and shape the sword. The hammer moves up and down via the water wheel located outside the building. There are also two stalls for housing the horse. Outside the stalls, there is a small bucket where the carrot is placed for the horse to feed on. The second floor has a fireplace, two portraits, a stool, and a table with a goblet on it. The table top can be lifted off to reveal a gold coin placed inside the barrel on which the table top is placed on.</div><div><br></div><div>The final build is the inn. The first floor is a pub. There is a table with goblets on it, a keg, and a barrel. The second floor has a fireplace, a bed, drawer, stool, table, perfume, and hairbrush. The second floor is accessed via a flight of stairs.</div><div><br></div><div>Both buildings are hinged such that you can open/close them to allow access to the interior. I enjoy how much attention designers paid to the detail that was put in to the buildings; they truly look like buildings from the Middle Ages. However, what I most enjoy is how this set can be integrated nicely into the city theme even though it is a castle set. This set can be the historical district, heritage park, or tourist attraction of your city.<div><br></div><div>There are some minor problems I would like to address. For example, the inn's second floor entrance does not have a door. The second issue is that everything is very cluttered without a baseplate. I used a grey 16x32 baseplate to place all the things on, and it looks much better. However, these problems are very insignificant.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this set is phenomenon and I know it will become a classic for years to come. For $149.99 CAD you can't get a deal better than this considering all the pieces you get (9.4 cents/piece). I recommend this set to any Lego fan, because YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT AT ALL.&nbsp;</div></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

It is absolutely brilliant. It is fun and challenging to build, it is fun to play with. The parts and minifigs offer plenty of opportunity for play. The suggested age range is 12+ reflecting how complex this set is. I tipped each bag out into a separate container, and a lot of rummaging was still required. However, most of the construction uses standard bricks, which my inspire people to try creating additional buildings from the plans.<br><br>Gems include the working waterwheel-powered blacksmiths hammer, the furniture inside the inn, the market stand, and two cows. All the minifigs have character (some have two faces for added interest), and the tree is really special too.<br><br>It's really hard to find anything wrong with this set, apart from the fact that I would like to get a second one. I was mildly disappointed that the cobbled road shown on the box-front is not available. Overall a highly inspirational set with high buildability and playability.<br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"jabbermabber","2011-10-03T02:26:37.55Z","The best set ever","<p>The Medieval Market Village is without a doubt the best set ever and well worth £71.99. It has extremely well designed parts, the minifigures are&nbsp;good and the buildings are brilliant.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>
<p>The box is rather big and contains 18 bags (if you count the cow bag as two bags joined together. The box art shows the town in full swing while the back shows the buildings interior and the play features (the water-wheel hammer and the opening and closing buildings, though I don't know why a boy stealing some food and a knight being attacked by a cow is a play feature). The instruction books were not bent and the stickers are amazingly designed but there aren't that many which is good.</p>
<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>
<p>Some interesting parts to the set are the animals. The horse isn't newly designed or anything but it is my first horse. The two cows are wonderful with eye printing, and I don't know what everyone complains about the 'Made In China' on their sides, because I can not see it. The three birds (duck, chicken and rooster) are made brilliantly out of bricks using some rare bricks in good colours (flippers for feet and the red clip on brick on the chickens head). Comparing this chicken to the one in Mill Village Raid (which I hope to get soon) I prefer this one because it has more detail and colours while they are one colour with a little bit of printing. The tree is very interesting and mine doesn't seem to fall apart like everyone elses. The market stand also stands out to me as being amazing along with the hammer/water-wheel and oven in the blacksmiths, and the bed and staircase in the inn.</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>
<p>The best minifigure in my opinion is the bar maid in the dark green dress. Her hair is amazing and she is the only figure with lots of back-printing. The other figures with little back-printing are the two peasant boys, the peasant man and the blacksmith. There are three double-sided heads on the two females (happy and scared) and one of the knights (grin and scared).</p>
<p><strong>The build</strong></p>
<p>The build is quite complicated which makes it good. This is my first set without numbered bags which meant you could just empty the whole contents into one big pile and then find the ones you want.</p>
<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>
<p>The model, when completed is rather impressive. What I feel it lacks is a base plate to put all the outside items on such as the tree and market stand.</p>

<p>The best set ever!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Ernst","2012-04-16T14:24:37.98Z","The Perfect Village","<p>Overall 5 bricks : This is without doubt the best Lego set I built until now. The result is outstanding, esspecially the 2 buildings of course but also the other things like market stall and all other minifigures and accesoires. The only thing you can complain about is the stabilty of the tree that also looks great by the way. The only set you can compare it with is <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=10223-1"">the Kingdoms&nbsp;Joust</a> but if I have to choose the MMV wins by far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 5 bricks : I'm not going to give a detailed review of the full built, that's done before and would be too long. I'll divide the built in 3 parts, the 2 buildings and the ""loose parts"". The first surprise is that the bags have no numbers, my advise is to first split all parts by color which makes the building more clear.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ""loose parts"" : the things you have to built here are the market stall with great red/blue roof, the carriage with hay, the birds, weapon rack and of course the tree with blossom. Building is not too difficult only the tree is a bit unstable and tends to loose the green branches. Great civilian minifigures and 2 Knights from the Fantasy Era and 2 great looking cows. 
<li>The Black Smith Shop and Stable : great looking building with good Medieval colors and nice features. The waterwheel which is connected to the anvil and&nbsp;the stables on the right side. Great design with the bows on the groundfloor and the tan first floor where the Smith lives. In the interior of the first floor a small table and chair and a great fireplace. Good looking black roof with a chimney on the side of the building. The biggest surprise for me was how the black vehicle mudguard is used here as window ornament. 
<li>
<p>The tavern is in my opinion, thanks to the blue color, the nicest building of the two. The first floor with the brown, grey and black colors looks elegant thanks to the use of arched grey mudguards and the front door entrance. The bright blue color and use of pearl gold plates on the ground and first floor make this building a real eye catcher. The interior is great too with the wine or beer barrel, the small bar, the fireplace&nbsp;and of course the beautifull bed on the first floor. The tavern has also an entrance on the first floor with outside stairs.</p></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : I can be short here, all parts are great and usefull for all your other projects. The stickers in this set are kept to a minimum and very good. The stickered parts are single and can be used for possible Castle MOC's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks : No further explanation needed I think, one look at the picture or finished set says it all. When finished I took a <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=628-1"">grey groundplate</a> to put it on to be able to put the things steady in place. Later on I added another grey plate and added some sets like <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6067-1"">The Guarded Inn</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7947-1"">The Prison Tower Rescue</a>&nbsp;which fits in very well and had already a real small village.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : RRP in Holland is some €100,00 for this set but it is worth every single eurocent. I can advise anyone to buy as long as it is available new because I think this is a set that will rise in value same as the Modulars as soon as it is out of production. I was extremely lucky to find for half the price.</p>

"Javert24601","2012-01-18T18:55:28.76Z","Outstanding (No other word for it)","<p>Well I will start this review off by saying that, if it hadn't been for my Dad finding the Cardiff LEGO store while there on holiday, I would never have this set! I walked in and this was next to all the kingdoms stuff. As we were staying in Wales for two weeks I had many chances to come to the LEGO store and even when my parents wanted to go to another store I said I would wait in the LEGO store. And that is what I did. I couldn't stop looking at this set, I probably spent over 3 hours altogether just&nbsp;marveling&nbsp;at the sight of such beauty! Then when it was time to go back to Chepstow again I remember looking at my mum with sad eyes! Which is quite&nbsp;ridiculous&nbsp;for a 16 year old boy! But I really did love it that much.<br><br>For weeks to come I would be thinking about this set and looking it up countless times on&nbsp;eBay&nbsp;and LEGO.com and then finally, almost 6 months later, I have the money to order it! So my Dad bought it off LEGO.com on the Saturday and it appeared on the Wednesday!<br><br>You should have experienced how I was feeling at the point of opening the parcel to find this inside it! It was like, I was a child again! (I have loved LEGO for many years)<br><br>Hastily I took a photo for Facebook (Which unfortunately didn't go down well with my friends, who hastily slagged me off for having such a thing!) and here is that very photo!<br><br><span><span>[img]</span></span>https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/394144_104554746333919_100003381814728_23902_13860331_n.jpg[/img]</p><p><br>just looking back at this photo makes me want to relive the feeling of finally having it after months of waiting!<br><br></p><p>anyway without further ado I present my review!<br><br></p><h4>After Opening:</h4><br>The box contained 17&nbsp;separate&nbsp;bags, 2 instruction booklets and a sheet of stickers.<br>The sizes of bags were mixed. Here is a photo I took after emptying the box:<br><span><span>[img]</span></span>https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/408165_104554986333895_100003381814728_23904_2043052000_n.jpg[/img]<br><br><h4>1601 Pieces:</h4><br><span><span>[img]https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/394834_104558059666921_100003381814728_23929_393239297_n.jpg[/img]<br></span></span><br>After 2.5 gruelling hours of sorting bricks (made faster with Phantom of the Opera in the background) the dining table was mine! I thought before building it would be better if I sorted the bricks (as this is the biggest set I have ever had). Maybe you won't make this mistake (if you do make sure you have a good long musical album!)<br><br>I was surprised at some of the pieces in this set (for instance the parts usually used next to wheels on cars and also the grey car parts used as arches on the tavern and the Blacksmith's Crystal) and some pieces were lovely additions and completely new to me!<br><br><h4>The Minifigures:</h4><br><span><span>[img]</span></span>https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/402948_104559503000110_100003381814728_23943_1706103513_n.jpg[/img]<br><br>In this set we get 8 minifigures, 2 Royal soldiers (tax collectors), a traveler, a teenage peasant, a child peasant, a stallholder and some other random woman peasant (probably the mother of the two boys) and a blacksmith peasant.<br><br>For someone who has bought this set without buying the previous castle sets, they get two knights with logos which are unrelated to recent sets which is a shame but I'll bet I'll be picking up the castle which has more of these knights (if I can find one for a reasonable price).<br><br>The peasants are lovely additions and have some great headpieces (the hoods especially). The torsos are all similar and despite the boys and the traveler having the same torso, they are all really nice! The two women have the same face but that's alright. I don't really mind though!<br><br>The Blacksmith has such an evil looking face to him but I really do like him!<br><br><p></p><h4>The Build:&nbsp;</h4><br>Altogether it took me around 1.5 hours but for the inexperienced builder it will probably take considerably longer. It is a pretty straight forward build and because of the repetition in the tavern it may seem to take longer than it does but the results are outstanding so the build time is definately worth it!<br><br>First you make the minifigures as per normal in a lego set then comes the animals (1 horse, 2 cows and a chicken, a duck and a&nbsp;cockerel) and after this you build the cart with hay and the market stall and organize the tubs of fruit and the table with food. Then comes the tree followed by the 2 houses. All are simple builds and the market stall and tree do not take long to make at all!<br><br><h4>Final Result:</h4><br><span><span>[img]https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/401771_104561632999897_100003381814728_23967_1303586037_n.jpg[/img]<br></span></span><br>The final outcome of the set is beautiful! The Blacksmith shop part of the set features a water wheel that when turned makes the hammer, bang against the anvil. it also features a stable (complete with fodder, who'd have thought it?!) where you can store your horse (and feed a carrot to it) and cows (probably my fave figures of the set!). Upstairs features two portraits (stickers), a table with cup and stool to go with it and a safe!<br><br>The Tavern features a Bar, a barrel with tap, a bed, a dressing table (with hairbrush and what I believe is perfume), a dresser and a fireplace. The tavern also has a sticker for the sign (I guess the tavern is called ""The King's Crown"")and stairs leading to the upstairs part of the house.<br><br><h4>How Does It Fit With The Old Castle Sets? :</h4><br>Well I had already built the Guarded Inn (10000) and the Blacksmith Shop (3739) in the waiting period for the parcel and I thought since they were built I would take photos with them!<br><br><span><span>[img]</span></span>https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/398617_104563616333032_100003381814728_23993_631041137_n.jpg[/img]<br><br>Now comparing this set to the older sets, it does fit in well but it also shows how far LEGO have come with their colours. In older sets the colours are nice and bright but are slightly lacking in eyecatchiness compared to the colours we have today! (yes I invented that word just for this review!)<br><br><h4>OVERALL:</h4><p></p><p>Overall this set is beautiful! I am so glad I finally got it after so long and I love everything about it. £71.99 for the biggest set I have had in terms of pieces? If you ask me that is AMAZING value! i am so glad LEGO have kept this set available to buy because people who don't have the money don't have to worry about waiting (Although LEGO told me on twitter we could see the end of this set in 2013 so I would bag it before it is gone!<br><br>I recommend this set to all LEGO builders EVERYWHERE. This is a set for everyone and anyone starting out with LEGO would also appreciate this as their introduction to the LEGO universe! I would say a kid of 7 years old would have trouble putting this together but someone from 10 years and older could probably crack the build (with a little help from bigger hands). If you love Castle themes and have no medieval buildings, definately get this set!<br><br>Thank You for reading and I hope you found this helpful! :)</p><br><br><br><br><p></p><p><br><br></p><h4><br><br><br><br><br></h4><p></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"naf","2013-07-25T13:44:39.543Z","Great castle set, Lego shows the peasantry some love!","<p>I came out of my dark ages early in 2013, and I have to admit that while Lego has a lot more themes available then in my collecting hayday in the 80's, I wasn't very impressed with what they offered. &nbsp; Although I didn't have many Castle sets as a kid, I liked the theme a lot. &nbsp;I had the 6085 Black Monarch's Castle, 6066 Forestmen Camouflaged Hideout, and a few smaller sets. &nbsp;I wanted more, but my family could only afford so much Lego and Space was my #1 theme. &nbsp;The current Castle theme was the ""fantasy era"" which for some reason didn't impress me. &nbsp;I love my fantasy, but in my mind Castle Lego is all about the knights, historically accurate looking castles (by Lego standards, anyway), and maybe a very few fantasy elements for flavor (like Black Monarch's Ghost). &nbsp;The stuff I was seeing was a bit over the top. &nbsp;Then I saw a review of the Medieval Market Village online and I knew I had to have it, it was unlike anything I've seen come out of Lego. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the set was retired by this point, but I managed to find one online pretty close to retail so I grabbed it. &nbsp;Enough with my personal history, let's get to the set.</p><p>Firstly, my favorite part of this set is the fact that it's all about the civilians! &nbsp;Out of the 8 minifigures only 2 soldiers are included, and it looks like they're just in town collecting taxes and keeping the peace. &nbsp;The rest of the figures are civilians. &nbsp;There's an old beggar with a walking stick, a peasant woman with her two children selling vegetables, a blacksmith, and a tavern wench in a green dress (she's probably meant to the a working class tavern owner, but she's a wench in my town!) &nbsp;You also get a bunch of animals. &nbsp;Two brown cows, a horse (glad to see the design is the same after all these years), and brick built birds: a chicken, rooster, and duck. &nbsp;These birds are cleverly designed and look great.</p><p>The two buildings are architecturally distinct. &nbsp;The blacksmith shop has a plainer, more utilitarian look, while the tan and blue inn looks more ornate. &nbsp;It has a working hammer that is connected to the water wheel on the outside of the building. &nbsp;The stables are next to the shop, and has two stalls for horses. &nbsp;The 2nd floor includes the living space for the blacksmith. &nbsp;It has a neat looking wood-burning stove and some pictures hanging on the wall. &nbsp;There's also a table on a barrel, with a gold coin hidden inside. &nbsp;Hope the tax collectors outside don't find out!</p><p>The tavern has a bar with golden cups and a barrel of ale on the first floor, and a bedroom on the 2nd complete with a quilt over the bed, and a perfume bottle and hairbrush on the dresser. &nbsp;This could be the tavern owner's personal quarters, or a room at the inn that travelers can rent.</p><p>The little extras fill out the scene nicely. &nbsp;I've noticed that some larger Lego sets are simply a bunch of smaller builds that make up a scene. &nbsp;Here, the two buildings are the star of the show, while the extras provide some extra details. &nbsp;The little market stall has a nice colorful canopy that really brightens the set up. &nbsp;You get baskets filled with apples, fish, and flowers for sale. &nbsp;A small table is provided for feasting, and comes with a bowl of bread, some cheese, and a turkey. &nbsp;The small horse cart is simple, but still very nice. &nbsp;It comes with a few bales of hay to carry, but you can also transport full kegs of ale to the inn. &nbsp;The last bit is a small weapons rack, with a few spears and a halberd. &nbsp;I ended up putting this near my blacksmith shop as he's probably the one forging all of these weapons.</p><p>The build was very enjoyable, I took two evenings to finish it. &nbsp;None of it feels repetitive, and the two buildings are different enough to feel distinct from each other. &nbsp;The only problem I had was the 2nd floor of the blue inn/tavern building. &nbsp;It was a little unstable until I got the 2nd floor and roof attached. &nbsp;I ended up sorting the bricks into 3 bins, one for the very tiny pieces, one for small-medium pieces, and a 3rd for the larger pieces. &nbsp;This seemed to work well enough, I don't see how further sorting would have made the build go any faster. &nbsp;I never had a problem finding pieces.</p><p>If I had to criticize the set, it would be for the fact that I wish they wouldn't have put tiles on all the flat surfaces. &nbsp;I know they look nicer, but without studs, items such as food and perfume bottles tend to fall off if jostled slightly. &nbsp;I might replace these surfaces with studded plates so that the food doesn't go flying whenever someone touches the buildings. &nbsp;Also, I think a few more minifigures and another market stall would have added more to the outdoor market aspect to this set.</p><p>Overall, this is a great set and I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up. &nbsp;I think kids and AFOL's alike will enjoy this. &nbsp;There is lots of playability here on it's own for the kids, even more so when you add other castle sets to it. &nbsp;However, the playability is limited to posing, crafting items with your little blacksmith, selling goods, and running an inn. &nbsp;If you're looking for a battle, it's not here. &nbsp;It makes a nice display piece for the adults. &nbsp;I added the Lego Kingdoms Mill Village Raid set to expand the village; these sets go great together. &nbsp;Although Medieval Market Village is a Castle set (from the fantasy era), I feel like the Kingdoms sets go better with it since they don't have the fantasy elements that Castle includes. &nbsp;Medieval Market Village also fits in nicely with older Castle sets. &nbsp;Black Monarch's Castle overlooks the village, while my forestmen attack the tax collectors bothering the peasants.</p><p>Medieval Market Village - buy it! &nbsp;You won't regret it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"mediAFOL","2020-09-10T14:32:46.557Z","Simply magnificent","<p>Becoming an AFOL, I knew nothing of post-Classic castle sets. My Seventies <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57574"">yellow Castle</a> was bought and built, but I wanted more. I then discovered the greatest Lego set ever released.</p>

<p>It was pricey to get hold of once retired, but it was worth every penny. Again, hinged buildings hark back to the yellow castle, but here the result is much, much better. Closed, we have the much-desired complete building (no open backs here). Open, we have a considerable length of medieval street-front.</p>

<p><img alt=""Medieval Market Village - closed"" src=""https://tom.chadw.in/assets/pics/Lego/villageClosed.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 398px;"" /></p>

<p>Everything about this set shines, but the focus should rightly remain on the two buildings. There is delightful contrast between the grey and earth tones of the industrial mill and the gorgeous dusty blue of the posher tavern. The windows in both buildings are simply beautiful, and the differences again add to the interest of the whole scene - the roofs run in different directions, and the eternal staircase of the tavern bridges the external to the internal.</p>

<p><img alt=""Mill - open"" src=""https://tom.chadw.in/assets/pics/Lego/millOpen.jpg"" style=""width: 601px; height: 446px;"" /></p>

<p>As for the interiors... This was my first experience of what have become very common furniture builds, and I am still knocked out by them. The patchwork quilt and sideboard are delightful, as is the anvil. They bring joy through their economy of pieces, and through lack of specialist piece use. I love them.</p>

<p><img alt=""Inn - open"" src=""https://tom.chadw.in/assets/pics/Lego/innOpen.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 528px;"" /></p>
