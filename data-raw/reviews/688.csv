<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set features a Black Futron Space Minifigure. The design of the little ship is fairly solid with wings that fold and two forward lasers. About the only problem I've had with this set is a question of how does the ship move forward as it lacks any propulsion from behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite that, it's still a good little set and good design.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3

I looked, and looked and could not figure out which set this belonged to. &nbsp;I knew I had 6785 but I thought that was the only one I had. But thanks to Brickset, I found out this set came with two other sets (one of which I remembered) and as soon as I put everything together, I was able to build this set for the first time in over 20 years.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I have neither the box or the instructions, I had to source the instructions off the internet. Easy build, nothing fancy.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A mix of white and black pieces with a few clear blue discs (garbage can lids?) and a two red rods make up a small &quot;scout&quot; ship.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One spaceman with a blue visor.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model itself was an easy build. Finding the pieces after all of these years was the only problem. The wings can be angled down.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t remember ever building this set although I must have at least once. Sets like these are great. It is very &quot;swoosh-able&quot;. This is the type of set that a young child can take anywhere they go.</p>
