Pros

The Patty Wagon Is Really Strong. I'd Always make it ramp off the box and land on one folder I had, it wheels come of sometimes and the flag only stayed on once. I got angry and threw away the flag.


Pros:
Patrick With His Tongue Out
Patty Wagon 
Grill
Safe
2 $100 dollar bills

Cons:
Patty Wagon Flag always Falls
No Squidward!
You Can Lose The Enter Sign Easily

"MasterOfDisaster","2010-08-17T17:23:32.51Z","Not Even Worth Getting For The Little Kids","<p><strong>&nbsp;LEGO SpongeBob SquarePants&nbsp;Krusty Krab Adventures Review</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall: 2/5</strong></li></ul>
<p>This set is not so great, there are stickers, randomly placed pieces, and&nbsp;hardly an&nbsp;interior inside the Krust Krab its self. On the bright side the Minifigures, the $100 bills, the little LEGO Krabby Pattys, and the Krabby Patty based vehicle are the only things I can give credit to in this set. Overall, I think the Krust Krab interior should have been expanded a little bit more, and that maybe they should have added more&nbsp;stuff inside and outside to make it actually look like an actual restaurant, and still keep the colorful factors of the Krusty Krab. You should only get this set if your a&nbsp;big fan Of SpongeBob SquarePants or if your trying to collect&nbsp;all of the&nbsp;LEGO SpongeBob SquarePants sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Building Experience: 1/5</strong></p>
<p>Being the set that it is, to build this set was not challenging at all, even for the younger children, if you like the challenge of building than this is not the set for you, if your a person like me and just wants to build the set and get it over with so you can actually play with it, then get it if you can't find anything better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Parts: 4/5</strong></p>
<p>The best thing about this set, and probably the best reason why you probably want to buy this set is for&nbsp;the parts. This set has some strong, brightly colored parts. The minifigures designs and head molds are really great. I really like the flags, the Krusy Krab sign, and the enter sign. I would give the parts a perfect 5/5 rating, but the wannabe grill, safe, and cash register makes me have to give the parts a 4/5 rating. If you like to build you own LEGO creations than get this set just for the parts aspect of it, if your getting this set to add to your collection like I&nbsp;did because the parts made the set look really good, then chances are that you will be disappointed as I was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Playability: 2/5</strong></p>
<p>Again, being the set that it is, there is not alot to do with this set, I mean, you can try to put one of the minifigures near the cash register, you can try to put one of&nbsp;the Krabby Pattys on the grill which by the way, makes the Krabby Patty look monstrous, but most of the time you'll probably be driving around the Krabby Patty based&nbsp;vehicle most of the time with one of the minifigures in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Value For Money: 2/5</strong></p>
<p>$19.99 is slightly over priced for this set, but what do you expect. Most sets with 200&nbsp;pieces or more are around this price range. Nothing more to say about that.</p>

"Phantom","2010-11-07T14:37:21.863Z","Not much of a Restaurant...","I got this soley for the figures included, as i thought Lego would stop selling spongebob,and i would miss my chance to get the little yellow man and his pink tubby friend, better, his cheapskate boss Krabs!<br/>The figures are well designed, theres nothing wrong with them, all have special headpieces.<br/><br/>Now onto the great patty wagon, which i just love! it brought back warm memories from the movie back in 2004, its got a good selection of tan pieces for the bun, and the meat, cabbage and mustard was a nice addition. It can seat both figs, Patrick and Spongebob.<br/>I cant help thinking lego could have made some green wheels because in the movie, the car had pickles for wheels, nonetheless, perfect!<br/><br/>Now for the, sadly the letdown of this set....The Krusty Krab<br/>Its just appauling, i mean literally TERRIBLE, what were TLG thinking, instead of making a better version than the 2006 one, they make a worse rendition of it.<br/>Its got holes everywhere, it just looks like a structure to support a building, its incomplete, it needs windows, better walls and most importantly AN INSIDE!<br/>Sadly,&nbsp;LEGO wont be designing anymore new spongebob sets, so i guess we'll never see this beatiful restaurant brought back bigger and better, how sad.<br/><br/>Well, this concludes my review of this, i do however reccomend this as the patty wagon and figures are great! If you have some spare pieces laying around, you can make the 'restaurant' better and actually useful.<br/>",TRUE,2,3,2,3,2
