Patrick is fine. the sticker on gary's food bowl keeps coming off.  and its not a too exciting play set. i just have this and the krusty krab from 2006 and i spend much more time with the krusty krab. but despite what i said, its a great set ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sethlee","2009-11-14T14:36:18.687Z","Best spongebob ever!","I can't belive it! they may have re release spongebobs pinnapple but this time its better. Squidwards head isn't so scary anymore well he still has 2 legs. Spongebob looks like he's going to burn somebody. Patrick has a catapult car and looks like he did something to Mr. krabs.Inside is surprisingly dissaproved since it looks like somebody used a shrink ray. Gary has cherrys for eyes and looks like E.T with a shell. I can't belive that theres only 1 jellyfish and looks like a hat. I wonder why squidward is reading a book In front of spongebobs house? The TV is so small that Larry the Lobster can throw it at someone. The set is big so luckly I can trap my shrunken head in spongebobs house so he can no longer bother me.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"alva","2010-12-06T11:50:58.473Z","Not recommended spongebob set","Bought this set since I thought that the pineapple house is the main icon of the spongebob story and Lego will be putting more effort on this set.<br>But turn out that I dont like the set at all.<br>The leaves of the pineapple is easily fall off whenever I move the set.<br>There's also too much stand alone parts (the car, the barbeque, the chair, gary, spongebob..) making it doesnt look as one set but a lot of small sets.<br>One thing I like about this set is that the pineapple house is really look similar with the real one in the movie.<br>Really not recommend you to buy it, unless it is on big sale.<br><br>",TRUE,2,3,2,1,1
"legofanatic2414","2009-11-27T14:35:21.123Z","""Spongebob whats wrong with your house?"" - Squidward","I think this was a BIG waste of money! if you already have the 2006 version (which is way better) you don't need this, but if you really want to decorate Spongebob's house than be my guest. The house has little pictures of SB and his friends, and Squidwards look'n better. I really wouldn't recommend it but only if you have the 2006 set, otherwise its a really cool and detailed set.

      PROS-
         new sqidward
         reef blowers great
         more detailed spongebob house

       CONS-
         yet another same old Patrick
         bed isn't detailed enough

"legomario112","2011-01-01T00:37:39.14Z","Something Fun You Can Buy","<p>Well the most popular building toy Lego has been around for years and it is still famous today but on 2006 Lego Sponge Bob came out then at 2009 Lego Sponge Bob good neighbors at bikini bottom came out and i bought the set and i decide to give my thoughts to you.</p>
<p>this set is about where Sponge Bob and Patrick annoy Squid ward. It comes with 4 mini figures. Sponge Bob, Patrick, Squid Ward, and Gary. You also get the pineapple with his chair, T.V, and much more! well does the squid have a house? Not really.......but he still has something what he has is his relaxing bench,his umbrella, and his grill with a burger launcher.</p>
<p>Gary has something [of course] the only thing he's got though is his food bowl and it says Gary on it like in the T.V show. <br />
<br />
Patrick also has something he's got his boat with a marshmallow launcher!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Well i think you should buy the set even though its not the whole neighborhood D: just to let you know i did not explain everything that's in the set because i want you to see it but i give it a 5/5 because i don't know what to complain about it :D</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,5

"CherryRose","2015-10-09T03:49:49.543Z","Who Lives in a Pineapple Under the Sea!?","<p>If you don&#39;t know the answer you&#39;ve been sleeping under a rock longer than Patrick. Of course it&#39;s SpongeBob. The show that reruns twelve times a day with tons of merchandising and you start to get sick of it, yet&#39;s always filled with jokes so that you can get a good laugh every time? Yeah, that SpongeBob. And with everything popular there&#39;s inexplicably a Lego set or fourteen to go with it, and while this them didn&#39;t get much attention in particular, it still feels like one of the ones that embodies Lego&#39;s spirit: getting all wacky and fun. And this set is, in my opinion, one of it&#39;s finest.</p>

<h3>The Minifigures</h3>

<p>While I&#39;m not one to care about the figures, the ones you get are the ones you need. It&#39;s pretty obvious who they are: SpongeBob, Squidward, Patrick and Gary.</p>

<p><strong>SpongeBob: </strong>Absorbent and yellow and porous is he, SpongeBob is the same as every set that was released in the line, only this time is given a very suspicious grin to match the excitement of having an oversized hairdryer to play with. It&#39;s cute.</p>

<p><strong>Squidward: </strong>Regardless of whether he&#39;s a hobo or not, Squidward does well to capture the show&#39;s likeness, with his plain collared shirt that SpongeBob always dreamed of owning, and a head that&#39;s a vast improvement over the &#39;06 version, giant head and nose as all. He&#39;s given a full Sunday &quot;Relaxation&quot; kit, sarcasm and all.</p>

<p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Patrick is Patrick. He&#39;s appeared this same way in half the sets, with his regular pointy head and, disturbingly, half-printed swim trunks. He gets a boatmobile in the likeness of &quot;Driven to Tears&quot; only more casual and quite roomy.</p>

<p><strong>Gary: </strong>Can&#39;t really call this a figure given the brick-built nature of it, but that&#39;s kinda the fun of it. Just give SpongeBob a nice companion to care for and feed with a conspicuously empty food bowl.</p>

<h3>As a Playset</h3>

<p>Man, there&#39;s so many scenarios you can make with this, from waking SpongeBob up just to screech &quot;I&#39;M READY!!!&quot; on the way to work, to taunting Squidward with a cardboard box or a sea bear, or just casually going around town selling chocolate. You know what, forget reenacting, just get SpongeBob to fly with his/her whatever reef blower and break a hole in the roof solely to watch TV at the end for all I care, this is a great playset. While the lack of Squidward or Patrick&#39;s house could come as a detriment, there&#39;s still plenty to go around. Included are a toal of 3 (!) catapult/launcher thingies, being the bed that can splat SpongeBob on the wall, a grill for tossing a burger (that given Squidward probably isn&#39;t a krabby patty), and even a freaking marshmallow launcher for your boatmobile! There&#39;s a nicely built reef blower that you can easily pretend to blow and suck up your spice garden and windows, and the nice, large pineapple is jam-packed with furniture to just sit around and watch tv, going into an infinite paradox of watching more SpongeBob!</p>

<h3>As a Display Model</h3>

<p>While some may call this a downgrade to 3827 in terms of it&#39;s overall size, it is still substanstial in it&#39;s own right. Unfortunately, it isn&#39;t the most accurate thing if you were to do a side-by-side comparison--the color would have been more accurate if it were flame-yellowish orange and had less obvious red (although that&#39;d be expensive so what gives), it&#39;s shaping, while it gives a good, sneaky illusion, is still quite blocky, the windows are quite undersized... but still, it looks proper in the LEGO universe and you can tell immediately what it is. The bright and cheery colors help it to pop in a sea of grey Star Wars stuff and the accessories only help make the scene lively, like something&#39;s really &quot;going on.&quot;</p>

<h3>As a Building Experience</h3>

<p>The build is simple, but effective and fun. While there are a handful of nice, interesting ways of dealing with thins like how the pineapple curves almost perfectly, it&#39;s mostly good &#39;ol simple brick-upon-brick-upon-brick construction that&#39;s both friendly for nostalgia-hungry fans and kids at an entry level. It works well.</p>

<h3>As a Parts Pack</h3>

<p>Did I mention bright colors? Lots of &#39;em here. One of the most noteworthy things is the every-abundance of orange: multiple sizes of bricks and plates, over a dozen wedge pieces, tall slopes, regular and inverted, printed submarine windows, and a full dish element, it&#39;s a paradise given how rare orange is compared to other simple colors. There&#39;s plenty of variety: wheels, palm leaves, pennants, dishes, and just regular bricks and tiles in just about everything on the color wheel makes it quite abundant for resources.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>Do I have a nostalgia bias? Well, yeah, if anything it&#39;s the set that got me into Lego in the first place. But it&#39;s still a great set that I think is worthy of picking up anytime, and if you like the show, or even &quot;like the classics and hate the modern stuff,&quot; this would be a fun and long-lasting gift that, who knows, maybe you&#39;ll still love to this day.</p>
