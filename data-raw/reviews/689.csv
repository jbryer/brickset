I like this helicopter's design - the red side tanks and the reinforced tail boom.  That sets it apart from the other Lego helicopters out there.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It comes as part of a Value Pack with two other sets. There's a minifigure pilot, a bright contrast of colors that's easy to build and doesn't look too clunky. There's a pair of lights underneath the helicopter that suggest this could be used at night as part of a search and rescue or for night time landing. Finalizing the set is a small little tool rack with a wrench, welding tool and an oil drum.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
