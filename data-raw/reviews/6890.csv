I never thought that this would never be pulled off in micro scale, but Lego did it. It is very detailed from the front to the back of the vehicle. Overall, this is a very good model, and I don't give 5s out to micro scale sets too often.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The color scheme is wonderful, my friend says it looks like a Waste Management truck. More pics of this set can be seen at:

The shape of the truck is spot on considering it is not even in minifig scale. The truck not only opens from the rear but it also tips backwards to empty out the trash. Great selection of harder to find bricks that are normalish (1x2 Green profile bricks, light gray cheese slopes, 1x2 smoke trans bricks, and the plate with arms that the rear door snaps on to). 

I love getting Brickmaster Exclusive sets throughout the year because they are just that...exclusive! The Star Wars minis have been cool but for a City Fan like myself, this set rocks!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:

-Tilting bucket and opening 'door' at the back

-Colors are nice

-Makes $40 USD worth the BM subscription

Cons:

-NONE!

Overall, great little set, worth maybe five dollars USD.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The back door on the truck is a-little strange. The set has cool feature that alows the green part tilt down, and the door can open to let garbage out. The set has two extra pieses that can be used as trash. The only con of this set is the green part can fall of real easily because it is only atached by two stubs

 Over all this set is very cool I would give it 4.9 stars instead of 5, but just round it of to 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
