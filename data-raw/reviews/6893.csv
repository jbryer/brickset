"newlegoset333","2008-12-30T18:01:55.733Z","Pricey, but worth it!","I bought this set from Shop@home a few days ago and it arrived today. It is similar, but has a different design then Anakin's starfighter. Also, R7-A7, the red white and green droid has a Death Star style head, and not a regular one. Let's get right to it!

Pros: New double missile feature! (You push on the back of the ship and it hits the two flick fire missiles.)
New droid
Silver-hilted lightsaber
Brand new Vulture Droid with stripes on the head
2 Buzz droids
The two center pieces on the ship have no stickers, and are printed on
Ahsoka's ship is the same as Obi Wan Kenobi's and Kit Fisto's, so it acts as three ships at once.

Cons: A little bit expensive...

Over all, it's worth it completely.

"jjr","2009-01-13T10:45:56.03Z","lEGO crazy!?","I reeally wanted this set, and with my last money I wanted to buy it. when I came at the toysrus (nehterlands) I saw every star wars set was much expensiver, the AAt (I got that one three days earlier for 50 euro) was now 55 euro, and ofcourse this set was 50 instead of 45 like it was three days ago. however I really wanted it

the built: vulture droid is excact the same as the naboo one (I got all vulture droids even the first one!)
the ship is beautiful and really shinny. a great adition to my star wars collection

playability: it is nice to play with, it has some featurers (the flick fire missiles) but only play with ashoka VS vulture droid is also fun

price: the worst thing is, it is WWAAAYY overpriced. it's like last years spider droid. I really would prefer a 30-40 euro price ratio, but lego is beginnen emptying our walleds. 

I would recommended this set to a star wars fan, but not for someone who just want to buy something, buy the AAT instead",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"wyoeaglefan","2009-01-26T09:25:58.14Z","Good to see printed elements, but another vulture droid?","I was having a hard time justifying the $40 that they want for this set, but I saw it at wal-mart and decided to pick it up anyway. The Jedi Starfighter actually has printed pieces rather than stickers for the slopes on the front! And this starfighter looks much better than Anakin's that was released earlier. The R7 droid is nice, especially as a refreshment for us collectors that have like 40 R2s. The buzz droids are alright but not overly exciting, and another vulture droid? Personally this set would have been much more attractive as the Jedi Starfigter alone for $20 like Anakin's. If you think you need it, go ahead and get it, but otherwise save $40.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"CloneWars08","2009-01-25T01:25:40.28Z","Very nice set","I got this set a few days ago and it's pretty cool. It has two ships, and four minifigures including two rare buzz droids and a new astro droid. 

Pros:

Return of the Buzz Droids.
Ashoka's ship also, as others stated, looks like Obi Wans and Kit Fistos so that's a plus
New astromech droid R7 
Vulture droid has nice colours, much better then the brown from Naboo N1 and Vulture droid.

Cons:
Price could be better, but I'm ok with it.

I think the price is decent, I think this is a better deal then the AAT personally because you get TWO ships and very cool minifigures including R7 droid and Buzz Droids. That's all my opinion though. I would most definitely pick this up. It's a nice set for an ok price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"yodaccm","2009-02-18T19:05:42.45Z","New Improved Jedi Starfighter!","Ahsoka's starfighter is a nice update of Anakin's Jedi Starfighter introduced last year.  Anakin's ship was an o.k. set, with very few features and a somewhat bland construction.  Ahsoka's fighter is an improved version, though still having some flaws that were present in the earlier incarnation.  

This time around, not only do we get the starfighter, but a few bonus models as well.  We have a nice dark blue vulture droid to match the recent Separatist sets that have arrived lately.  This time around, we have flick fire missiles that don't fall out when you pose the droid in it's standing position.  That's a plus.  Other than that, it's the same model from the Naboo starfighter set.

Also present are a couple of little buzz droids, introduced in Revenge of the Sith as cannibalistic droids that mutilate fighters and droids alike.  They are nice renditions for a Lego set, a bit overscale, but how else could you interpret them?  I believe these are in another earlier set, but o.k. to have them now if you didn't buy the eariler one.

We get another Ahsoka fig (next to Anakin, she appears to be the other fig that seems to be in every other set.)  We also get a new astromech droid with a color scheme that fits with the starfighter and the rest of the Republic's war machine.  A big plus.  New droids are always fun.

The starfighter itself is pretty good.  It's been overhauled a bit from the previous model, some more stickers and a working mechanism to fire the flick fire missiles on the bottom of the ship.  I am glad to see that the developers come up with interesting ways to manually fire these flick fire missiles instead of just ""flicking"" them with your finger.  It is usually some simple kind of lever or button you push and the missiles just pop out.  Not overly complex but effective.  

Once again, though, we have a non opening cockpit.  You simply remove the cockpit dome and put in your minifig.  Don't know why that was not addressed.  Certainly they could have giving it some kind of hinge to swing up and down on.  I suppose you could customize it yourself.  

Finally, they have addressed the ""where do I put Ahsoka's lightsaber while she flying around in this thing?"" issue from the previous set.  Before, you just left the lightsaber out.  This time, though, they have come up with an idea.  And it's kind of a cop-out.  In the instruction manual, on the last page where it shows you the completed model, they have put the lightsaber, end first into one of the black nubs on the wing of the ship.  

The lightsaber is literally being held in place by it's own blade.  Which makes no sense, but whatever.  You can do that same with Anakin's on his fighter, so it's no new idea, but at least they came up with something.  

Overall, not a bad set.  It was about $43 with tax.  A bit much for a retooling of a previous model, but still a nice addition.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"captain_radda_radda","2009-02-25T23:05:21.56Z","The real clone star fighter","Seriously, this set is an exact clone of Anakins starfighter. It is still great though

Starfighter
The star fighter itself is very sturdy. The weapons on it are cool, but Lego tried too hard with the auto missles. For once, comething has printed decals! 
r7 is awesome and has an animated head. 

Vulture Droid
The vulture droid is pretty small, but is decent. The flick fires are a nice touch. 
The buzz droids are oversized and are lame just like in ep. 3

Pros:
Ahsoka's star fighter is really well made
The color scheme rocks

Cons
Tiny Vulture 
lame Buzz droids
About 5 dollars overpriced",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legonater","2009-03-23T18:02:28.78Z","60 Bucks? No Thanks","I have come to realise that this set is not worth the money. Here's how:
I'm walking through Wal-Mart with 30 bucks in my wallet. I see the price tag, and is says 25. I thought it was a good price, so I pick it up. I'm at the till, and put down the set. She scans it... ""60 dollars and (however many) cents."" Both me and  my dad are shocked. I'm gaping and standing still. It was late, so my dad laughs, says ""No thanks."" and picks it up. The person suggests calling someone, but we're already leaving. I was about to pick up the hHeana bomber instead, but like I said, it was late. 
The vulture droid is nice, the starfighter's awesome, it comes with two buzz droids, Ashoka, and the astromech (All of which are awesome) but it is NOT worth 60. 25 is a reasonable price. Don't buy it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-03-07T20:40:43.28Z","Do We Need Another Vulture Droid?","Before this set, Lego had made 3 sets with a Vulture Droid. Lego does it again with this set which is pathetic. I already own a Vulture Droid so why bother? The Jedi Starfighter is OK and I like the printed pieces which Lego made a good choice doing so. The droid is a little weird because the head has different colors than the body of the droid. This set needs improvement but not by much.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"THX_1138","2009-08-15T10:28:17.7Z","Great!","This set is awesome. I really like the current Vulture droid design (which should be sold on it's own), and Ahsoka's starfighter is beautiful.

Pros:
-Ahsoka's starfighter is awesome, and it has some printed pieces (the dark red slopes on the front.)
-The droid (don't remember it's name) is cool, and is the only exclusive minifig in the set.)
-The Vulture droid is awesome, and looks good in blue.
-Reasonable price, but $30 would have been better.

Cons:
-A fair amount of stickers (I don't mind much but some do.)
-The buzz droids are awful, and if you don't count them as minifigs, then there are only two figs in a $40 set.
-The interior of Ahsoka's fighter isn't very good.
-Both fighters have flick-fire missiles (easily removed though.)
-The droid easily falls out of Ahsoka's fighter if you do a barrel roll.
-No detailing on the fin on Ahsoka's fighter.

"legoreviewer","2009-06-15T21:23:32.217Z","Meh...","Eh.. this set is just not the best. It's just like Anikan's Starfighter but a little bit bulkier. The price is too expensive for this set. The only cool part about this set is Ahsoka and R7.

Minifigs: Ahsoka is the main reason I got this set. Also R7 is cool. The buzz droids are ok but their nothing special.

Build: The build is pretty fast and simple. It only took me about half an hour to complete.

Final Product: Looks cool and is just like Anikan's. I have both so I would know.

"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-07-26T23:51:33.84Z","Great, great set","I gotta start off by saying when i went to the LEGO store in the King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia--go Flyers!) this set wasn't on my radar in the least bit. I went there fully expecting to walk out of there with something else, but upon arrival, said LEGO store didn't have hardly any of the summer '09 Star Wars sets, so i was forced to improvise. This, along with the Vader magnet set (see review) found its way home with me. Being relatively new still to Star Wars sets this was my first Jedi Starfighter but the Vulture droid is the exact same model from the '07 Naboo N-1, save for the blue CIS color scheme and stickers. The Jedi Starfighter is a great design, and a unique color scheme and R7 model (with the new droid head which was a huge plus--despite the fact that the colors clash badly) and my first Ahsoka minifig (not a big fan of her in the series) so there are a lot of good features here. Couple of final pointers:

-Vulture droid is updated from Episode I model (flick fire rockets, sleeker color scheme, but despite these the basic design and build is the same)

-Jedi Starfighter is awesome (better flick fire design than Anakin's version, fires both at the same time, new astromech model, starfighter is sturdy but has no weapon storage, and the droid socket is completely smooth, so rolling the ship makes the droid almost fall out)

-Rare and exclusive minifigs include some rare buzz droids, new R7-A7 droid, Ahsoka is semi-rare but cheap way to get her with this set.

All in all, if you love space battles, well, you can get one all in one box for only $40! Perfect set, glad the opportunity came by to snag it. Truely a must have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"parchioso","2009-07-03T07:27:10.78Z","Another great Starfighter, for the young and energetic padawan","Based on what I observed from forums and reviews, I suspect that this is another under-rated Lego Star wars set, is it possible that being a lady's starfighter discourages guys from buying it? But my personal experiences with this set is very positive, and as a result, I bought another box for storage.

Ahsoka is a wonderful character adding much vitality to the cast, her interaction with Anakin in the clone wars brings much youthful sensation to the series. The animation did a great job in presenting the young padawan but the lego character does not seem to duplicate the animation character very well, the minifig looks too mature too me.

But aside from Ahsoka and R7, the starfighter is very good, with printed parts (which is getting rare) and a nice dark red based color scheme. The droid fighter is also good, with a design which I think is very similar to 8016 Hyena Droid bomber, it can fold and stand vertically, quite an interesting model.

And despite hating stickers, the stickers in this set is well fit into the model, well, if it can be properly placed, for me it is always challenging to place stickers on the bricks nicely. 

The two buzz droids, however, can get loose easily, it is great though for us to have them again without getting the expensive old sets such as 7252 Droid Tri-Fighter.

I have read some reviews complaining about the price and it seems that some could have bought it at a strangely higher price, but I got it here in Hong Kong at around  USD 50, for 2 nice vehicles + 2 buzz droid + 2 minifigs, I see this as reasonable.

I would highly recommend this set.
