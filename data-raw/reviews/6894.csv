"sitting_duc","2009-02-15T14:43:46.14Z","Dinky","I bought this to complement the rather bigger 8275 I bought last year.

It is small and dinky and cute.

Build instructions are fairly good - but confusing in one or two places so pay attention. I do question why I need three books to make 2 models?
Final model is good, only real complaint is there is some slop in the worm gear, so the blade can slip up/down a bit.

It looks good parked next to it's big brother :)

I've not built the alternate model (yet)

Cost $19.99 NZD",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

However, one thing to watch for (same for some of the other mini sets this year) - the gears like to fall off the front axles. Seems that both gears and wheels like falling off the self terminating axles; I guess they are slightly smaller than normal axles / cross studs.

This mini bulldozer have only one function: you can raise and lower the blade. You can also build a mini excavator from the parts. The excavator has a movable crane arm, and it is turnable. I offer this small but very funny and clever set for every AFOL who is interested in Technic and it is good for kids too.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Capitán_Skrall","2010-10-19T18:11:59.973Z","Superb little model!","Still don´t know wich one is cutter between the dozer and the excavator. Well, check the review! Hope it helps!<div><br></div><div>This set comes with 165 pieces, 52 of them are threads wich is great. And then a few liftarms, lots of pins and axles. It even comes with a couple of cool plates for the shovel.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, after a nice time builiding, we complete the dozer. Wich features one function, via worm gear and by turning the axle thats on the back of the model, you can lift the front shovel. The design its simple but really cute, definitely looks like a real dozer with details like the pipe and the smooth shovel.</div><div><br></div><div>Then, the excavator. I like the function in this one better, mainly because the arm has more articulation, even though the second section movement is done manually. The superstructure also rotates. I really like this as a secondary model, even more cute due to the big threads. I mean they look big for the scale, and no, its not a con for me.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div>-Realistic look for the scale.</div><div>-165 pieces for 10 US$, great! (I paid 16 US$, still worthy).</div><div>-Useful pieces, it even has a nice amount of threads.</div><div>-All the functions works great.</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div>-The threads doesn´t roll really well in some surfaces.</div><div><br></div><div>So then, this set deserves a 5/5. Excellent models!</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
