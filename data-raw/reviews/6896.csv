"wildwill","2009-04-13T23:51:05.28Z","Pricey but Awesome","I just saw these at the Lego store at Downtown Disney (Anaheim), and had to have at least one, I may go back and buy them all at some point.  These are sweet looking models when all is said and done, but they are a bit on the smallish side.  

The packaging and booklet are nicely done, and it's great to see some smaller sets that are exclusive and difficult to find (with good secondary market value).  But in the end, you're paying $20 for under 100 bricks, and I just paid last week $20 for almost 1000 bricks (The Space Skulls set was on sale for $19.99).  

All that said, I hope they continue the line and add some more interesting landmarks.  I'd like to see something like the St. Louis Arch, the CN Tower in Canada, or even the Arc De Triumph in this scale.

"nath8888","2010-04-25T14:58:49.92Z","Cool, but Small","The whole buildings series could probably be summed up in one word: ""model"". These are minimalist sets, but they very accurately display the building that they are modled after. This is all well and good, since they use nice bricks to accomplish creating the empire state building (No Technic in this set). The only thing that's not minimalist is the price: at $20, this is waay over priced.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,3,3,2,3

"Thomson___Thompson","2011-06-05T22:29:20.997Z","The magestic Empire State Building","<p>This was my first Architecture set. I was looking forward to the theme, so the first chance I got I went down to the States and bought it.</p>
<p>The box is the first thing that hits you. The black is eye-caching and it opens diff. than normal. In the instructions there is a section on the history of the building and then the actual instructions. (as with all Architecture sets)</p>
<p>This set is meant to sit on your shelf. Not to play with.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The set is very easy to build. 
</li><li>The box and the model are both eye-catching.&nbsp;</li><li>You get a special printed brick. 
</li><li>It looks good, and looks like the real thing. 
</li><li>This set is the only non-grey-or-black small building of the Architecture line.</li><li>There's info on the ESB.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>It's not cheap ($20USD for 77 pieces). 
</li><li>It will fall apart easily (don't play with it.)</li></ul>
<div><br></div>
<div>Other than that, it's a good set and I recommend getting it if you have the chance.</div>
<div>Also, if you are making a very small scale MOC of a city, you can use this.&nbsp;</div>

Dont get me wrong, it is a cool set. Its the empire state building, it has to be cool! But it doesnt deserve just cool, it deserves a level of epicness just not present here! </p><p>It is so overpriced. For 20 bucks a world famous landmark should have a little more detail. This is extremely basic, to the point that&nbsp;it saddens me. Now if this set were 7 bucks or less them i would give it a 5, not a 3. But its almost three times overpriced. LEGO dissapointed me with this one.</p><p>I wouldn't neccessarily avoid getting it again if i knew how puny it was. Im a HUGE NYC memorabilia fan and i love the Empire State Building so im glad that this is a part of my collection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, im not telling you not to get this set. by all means do, but you can only appreciate it if you are a NYC fan. If it was actually worth the 20 bucks, as far as piece quantity goes, i would recoment it for anyone. sadly i cannot.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,2
"Nesquik","2013-06-08T16:46:36.04Z","Excellent Desk Filler","If you've had a browse of my other reviews, then you won't find another Architecture product there. That's not to say that I dislike this range, but I feel that its greatest inconsistency is the price per piece ratio, which will ultimately play a major factor in your purchase. The second factor is of course the design of the building itself.<div><br></div><div>The Empire State Building strikes me as a perfect desk-piece; it is neither too small or too large. It's also nice to know that the Empire State is such an important hallmark of Art Deco culture, a fashion that at the time celebrated modernity and exoticism. Providing you take an interest in this history, the model becomes a sweet reminder of when designers believed that the skies had to be conquered. To truly make a statement, the upper-most tower (on the peak of the building) was actually raised shortly after the building was labelled 'only' the second tallest in the city, and then suddenly become 'the' tallest. Ouch!</div><div><br></div><div>I've had the pleasure of building larger Architecture sets (particularly, Fallingwater), so it was interesting to visit this smaller experience. The included booklet is, regrettably, slimmed down so that the history of the building resides over just two pages, leaving the other 14 or so to the model's instructions. This is unfortunate as the larger models have an equally comprehensive narrative.</div><div><br></div><div>The build is simple and poses no problems. In fact, despite taking less than 10-minutes, I enjoyed it very much as an array of clever techniques form the precise ridges that give the building its unique shape.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Then of course we come to the pricing. On a practical level, you would have to be out of your mind to pay Â£20 for 77 small bricks, but this is where the Architecture range is quite unique. As if to justify the price, Lego encourage you to enjoy the build process and actually appreciate the model in question for what it is is - an incredibly well designed structure. Like all Architecture sets, the finished model is not<i> </i>designed to be completely accurate, but rather intent on capturing the <i>spirit </i>of the design. These are the features that we instantly recognise, but rarely give proper thought to.</div><div><br></div><div>This also applies to the light tan bricks used, which in my opinion look more striking than a realistic orange/dark brown colour. The base finishes the model off nicely with a printed name tile and professional black border.</div><div><div><div><br></div></div></div><div>The Empire State Building would make a perfect gift for anyone that likes small curios. This applies to most Architecture sets in general, but the Empire State stands out because of it's symmetry and determination. It is a small model, but it is also a timely reminder of our own ambitions.</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,3,3
"murrayhenson","2014-01-02T15:27:22.597Z","It'll still be around in the year 3,000","<p>Straight-forward set, so right into my observations and opinions:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Price: &nbsp;PPP is one of the more immediately noticeable aspects of this set and commentary on this set must touch on this. &nbsp;I find it hard to believe that anyone buys one of these sets without knowing how few pieces are in it, but that is besides the point. &nbsp;These sets a bit of a fashion item - something for your office, that sort of thing. &nbsp;So, yes, this isn't cheap compared to most other sets but it isn't really supposed to be.</li></ul><ul><li>Appearance: &nbsp;The Architecture sets are, generally, very good-looking. &nbsp;Their aesthetic seems to be uniformly classy, presentable, and professional. &nbsp;I happen to have the Brandenburger Tor at work and have received a number of positive compliments or inquiries. &nbsp;The ESB is right along those same lines. &nbsp;The base is the same size as the one for the Seattle Space Needle (and, presumably, other Architecture sets) but I note that the ESB set is actually shorter than the SSN.</li></ul><ul><li>The build: &nbsp;As other reviewers have noted, there's basically nothing to this build. &nbsp;What were you expecting with 77 bricks?</li></ul>
<ul><li>The instructions/architecture info: &nbsp;I actually found the info on the ESB in the Architecture instruction manual to be a bit scarce, although looking back at the SSN manual, I see that the amount of information is comparable. &nbsp;The info for the Brandenburger Tor, however, was more extensive.</li></ul><ul><li>Playability: &nbsp;absolutely none at all! &nbsp;Not even if you have a monkey minifig.</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>If you're looking for a little LEGO set for your desk/office, or happen to like the Empire State Building (or skyscrapers, NYC, or NNYC), or the colour tan, then this is the set for you. &nbsp;Heck, forget about the cost for a minute and try out one of the cheap ones like the ESB to see what it's all about.</p>",TRUE,4,2,3,1,3
"paul_merton","2012-06-12T03:56:45.67Z","There's a mistake in the instruction book!","This was my first experience with the LEGO Architecture series. I wasn't expecting many parts in this set, but I was nonetheless rather dismayed when I opened the box and saw how few parts there actually were. My first thought was, ""I paid <span style=""font-style: italic;"">how much</span> for this?!""<br><br>Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the building process, even though it was rather short. There are some nice basic SNOT (studs not on top) techniques to learn from, and the final result is surprisingly stable.<br><br>However, the main cause of disappointment for me was the instruction book. Although the instructions themselves are fine, the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">""A Word from the Artist""</span> section near the back of the book contains a grammatical error (the plural of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">landmark</span> is <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">not </span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">landmark's</span>!). Did nobody think to proofread Adam Reed Tucker's short paragraph before printing all of the instruction books? I'm honestly appalled by this mistake - not only does it set a bad example to younger builders, but it greatly detracts from something which I would regard as one of the selling points of the set. This section, plus the information about the design and history of the building, is one of the reasons I was willing to pay a very high amount for such a small set, so for there to be such an obvious mistake in the book is disappointing and inexcusable.<br><br>In summary, it's a nice small set, but the high cost certainly cannot be justified while there is a careless grammatical error in the otherwise professional-looking instruction book.<br>",TRUE,3,4,5,2,2

"NYC231","2014-03-24T18:39:46.287Z","LEGO Reaches for the Sky!","<p>I hope my review can be of assistance to you!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is actually pretty cool. It includes facts and pictures of the real Empire State Building. I actually kept my box and used it as a backdrop for the model itself. The instructions are pretty straightforward and very easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has most parts in the iconic Empire State Building&#39;s tan color. Of course, this model isn&#39;t the real thing, so there aren&#39;t that many parts and to the best of my knowledge there are no specialty parts for this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes no mini figures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build really took me only 15 to 20 minutes, so it was a nice little build like most other Architecture sets.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model does look like the Empire State Building and the scaling was done almost perfectly. I think the parts used were very appropriate for the scale at hand.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this product is mainly going to be a nice little display piece. It is nothing huge but is a must have for LEGO Architecture collectors. The only thing I wish LEGO would have done is make the Empire State Building into a model making series set. Still, this is a fitting model of the State Building.</p>
