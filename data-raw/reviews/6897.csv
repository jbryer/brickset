"Higgins","2011-01-08T05:45:46.8Z","Nice Small Display Set","<p>Set <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">#21003  Seattle Space Needle</span> (ages 10+) is part of the Architecture theme  (landmark series) and contains 57 pieces. The box says it was designed  by Adam Reed Tucker and retails for around $19.99 USD.</p>
<p>I got this set as a free gift at IEC 2010 Seattle via the USNC. It's  actually what got me back into actively buying LEGO again. These architecture boxes are a good representation of what it will really look like out on your table/desk/shelf, unlike other sets with lots of graphics added in.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>3 neat long flexible pieces</li>
    <li>Looks a lot  like the space needle</li>
    <li>booklet has details  on design and history</li>
    <li>extra cool if you live in Washington state</li>
    <li>printed  base piece that says &quot;Seattle Space Needle&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    <li>piece to price ratio (nothing new here)</li>
    <li>more of a display piece than a play set which is not a con for me but could be for younger folks</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Great little display set</span>. Worth the price if you are a fan of architecture/landmarks/space needles!</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,3
"gigdoat2","2011-04-02T17:56:26.84Z","A detailed model for display only","<p>You cannot really play with this set, it is a model. In my town I use it as a phone tower. I can't review this set like I do for other sets, but a pros and cons list</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice detailed model of the real sculture 
<li>The tile that reads ""Seattle Space Needle"" is printed</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the bendable parts you have to cut a part of them off, which can be a pain and it's ruined if you cut it too short</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is pretty hard to build, it takes expierience with lego, so 10+ is a good age guidlines. If you are under that age, ask someone 10+ to cut the bendable pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all it's a good model of the real suclpture, very much like the real one. 4/5</p>",TRUE,5,2,5,1,4
"alva","2012-02-29T19:46:11.363Z","Great Set with Bad Price","<p>This set is the first architecture set that I own. Not that I don't like the design, but the price is way too expensive for me. Here in Indonesia, the RRP is around USD 43, and with only 57 pcs parts, average cost per part is USD 0.75. It is really expensive, especially since the set doesn't come with any new or unique part. Even if I use the US Price, which is USD 19.9, average cost per part is still quite high at USD 0.35<br></p><p><br></p><p>Luckily, my brother went abroad yesterday, and without me asking, he bought me this set. Yay! So, I build it and this is my pro/con.<br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
Very realistic design using only minimal number of parts<br>Look really cool if you display it on the table, especially if your work is related with building (e.g. architect)<br>You got 1x8 black plate with printing ""Seattle Space Needle""<br>Better instruction book quality in term of printing and design<br>Super cool box. With a black box that seems very exclusive, this architecture line is really attracting for non Lego user, cause it doesnt look like a toy.<br>
<h4>Cons</h4>
Again, price is really something to consider here<br>The box size is tricking your mind. You will expect lot of parts, but the content of the box will be mostly air:)<br><br>So if you really like the design, just go buy it. You won't regret the final result. But I really wish that Lego can give a more reasonable price. Hopefully there will be some price cut in the future, but until then, the only way I will add my architecture set is hoping that someone give it to me.<br><br>",TRUE,3,3,5,1,1
"legospongepotter","2011-04-09T10:10:07.47Z","Great Model","This is my first Architecture set, though I know I'm going to get more eventually. The Seattle Space Needle right now is among my favorite sets. I'll tell you why<div><br></div><div>Down at the bottom is a base with a printed plate reading 'Seattle Space Needle.' Then you go up and you'll see three long flexible pole pieces that all touch the&nbsp;centre of the set, but you have to cut these pieces. They were a lot longer before. I don't know why Lego didn't just make them smaller.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>These flexible pieces pass around what I believe is the first observation deck, which is really just a piece used in&nbsp;Mind-storms. You go up higher and hit the second deck, which the&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;pass through. Then up top there's lots of detail with the roof. I like the ridged piece and the way it looks like the part in the real Needle. Adam Reed Tucker (the designer) used some circular pieces, each smaller than the one before, to make the roof look like a dome, but kind of&nbsp;overlapping. That's a neat touch. Then the lightning rod, a small pole piece, end the set and the height of 8.7 inches! &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At the end you get a pretty decent, rather fragile model that is great for display. It looks a lot like the real thing but it's bad for play. It's not made to scale for Minifigures, and is not for younger kids. 10+ is a good age range for this set. Thanks for reading.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,2,4
"connor_g","2014-02-24T07:43:47.877Z","Disappointing","<p>I grew up in Seattle so when I saw this set on a shelf I figured it would be a nice impulse purchase. But on top of having only 57 pieces, it&#39;s not even a very good representation of the Space Needle. It&#39;s not a very interesting build, either. Save your money.</p>

"Tie_defender","2019-08-15T07:52:07.327Z","Nice looking, but you have to cut pieces","<p>I think it is very accurate to the real life space needle and is a great display piece.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Pros and cons</h2>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<p>Looks accurate</p>

<p>Cool printed tile</p>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<p>Not that many pieces</p>

<p>Common pieces</p>

<p>You have to cut pieces with a pair of scissors</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a mediocre set, get it only if you want the model, not a great set because of common pieces</p>

"Mattchew","2022-01-04T09:16:41.193Z","One of the Better early Architecture models...","<p>In my opinion, the early Architecture theme was very rough. Way too simple and overpriced. Looking back at it, I&#39;m not even sure if they were good at the time. I don&#39;t think it had a good set until Fallingwater. The Space Needle has fared better than most, but I don&#39;t find it to be that strong overall.</p>

<p>I think the best thing about this set is how unique it is. 21003-1 is the only set I know that has something from Washington, and the only Architecture set where the grand majority of the pieces are technic! Obviously most sets from this theme have some technic, but this one has very few of the normal plates and bricks!</p>

<p>Looks wise, it is defiantly better than sets such as the Sears Tower, or the original Empire State Building. It no doubt looks like the needle, just very simplified. Early Architecture sets just look like globs of lego. I&#39;m glad this one was spared of that fate. I love how they used the gear to represent the observation deck. Very clever!</p>

<p>However, I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s amazing.&nbsp; It has a big issue, in that it comes off the stand extremely easily. Way too easily. There were times were it would just kinda, pop off its base. Very annoying especially for a display model.</p>

<p>Build wise it&#39;s not that interesting. Its, very simple, one of those sets that you can easily figure out just by looking at it. Which in theory is fine, but what kills it is the price. The fact that this 57-piece set was 20 dollars is baffling to me. Granted, there are 3 large pieces and a few tubes here. But the set is not that large. The build isn&#39;t that intricate. And considering that this model is long since retired, and has only shot up in price, I can&#39;t justify it.</p>

<p>Also, very minor critique, but I am not a fan of the tubes. They just sit there. They won&#39;t fall out but the fact that they shift up and down annoys me. I wish they added a grey half pin to keep it in place.</p>

<p>Overall, defiantly not the worst set and I am charmed by it a little. But I wouldn&#39;t really recommend it. I do hope they remake this set one day, wether as a landmark or part of a skyline.</p>
