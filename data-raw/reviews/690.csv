"Novelty","2007-03-30T12:24:17.503Z","Make hay while the sun shines","This is the only set with a peasant that is a US only promotional pack.  The plus though is that it includes a forestman, although that makes it rather weird that a forestman would be protecting a peasant... or is the forestman actually protecting the peasant?

The design of the chariot isn't too great - the top part of the wagon breaks off too easily for instance, and the balance of the wagon isn't too great as well.  And hay?  Erm... I'm sure there are better commodities to be transported.

Overall a rather disappointing set, although this is offset somewhat by the presence of the merchant/peasant and the forestman.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-03T15:03:17.123Z","Another cart with horse","This is another set with horse, and is a cart too. The cart is builted different, bigger than the promotional or the smaller sets, and can carry pieces, in the place of weapons or itens. This isn't an army builder, because the minifigures don't looks like one to other, but still great for other uses like to be used on creations or carry weapons or take the place to put more minifigures on aboard. Is cool and different, the horse is black, and the pieces some are, combining. The pieces carried on the cart are yellow on the image, and are useful too, to make buildings or be additions to these. Another pieces, these in the sides of the cart, don't makes the pieces fall to the side. Is easy to make creations with it, like carts, chariots, with old and new pieces and themes. It don't have a story, the owner of the set makes one, with a forestman with longbow ,another minifigure and a horse, don't looking weird.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-10-27T11:34:00.923Z","Smugger's Wagon Review","<p>This set is also part of a Value Pack. A wagon full of hay bales that&nbsp;an uncommon peasant minifigure is transporting and a forest man mini who accompanies them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For collectors of the Forestmen sets, this is a must as it features another such minifigure who's got a black feather. I'm partial to this set as it comes close to featuring a theme for Castle other then&nbsp;Knight minifigs for an army and allows for creating a village scene that Knights can attack or defend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My one real complaint with this wagon is that the sides of the wagon are prone to falling off during play.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
"Ernst","2012-10-15T12:19:12.657Z","Smuggler's Hayride; find the hidden treasure.","<p>Overall 5 bricks : First of all a set of a very good theme, all the Forestmen an Dark Forest sets are very good. This little set is very good too, with all the aspects of the ""good outlaw's"" present. A nice looking peasant cart with horse loaded with hay and a hidden treasurebox, one disguised outlaw and a forestman. It is very complete and a great addition to other Forestmen or other Classic Castle sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : no difficult building because of the size of the set, the only real building is the cart which is easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : Very good and usefull parts in this set, 2 very nice minifigures with a special remark for <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/?m=cas091"">the peasant</a> with pitchfork. The fences of the cart are usefull in other ways too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 bricks : a good playable set which would be 5 bricks with an enemy soldier added. Very usefull in other older Castle themes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 3 bricks : Being part of a US only 3 set package-deal this is not an easy set to find. I was fortunate to find it on the Dutch auctionsite for a reasonable price, <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=1974-3"">Bricklink</a> offers an average of some €35,00 - €40,00.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,3
