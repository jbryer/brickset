"lotographia","2009-06-14T22:22:48.78Z","A whole bunch of new minifigs.","The cheapest summer (or 'winter' where I live) Indiana Jones set for 2009 amazingly manages to have four minifigs that haven't been used before. Indy with his new open shirt, Marion with her Cairo wardrobe and two new Cairo villains, both with new torsos and faces. The minifigs alone earn this set a five brick score.

For the rest of the set, it's what you'd expect from the cheapest set in a range. Nothing particularly spectacular, although not disappointing either. The wagon could easily be connected to a horse, and a couple of cherries and bananas could be added to the market stand to give it more variety. There are a couple of metallic pieces, the frying pan and the bowl, and I don't think the machine gun has been used in an Indiana Jones set before.

Overall, this set is definitely worth it for the great value in new torsos and heads.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"skipp","2009-06-27T12:45:56.45Z","Best smallest Indiana Jones Set of all time","As the title says, this is probably the greatest indiana Jones set of all time. Not only do you receive four brand new minifigures, but you also get loads of awesome pieces (The return of purple) and in my opinion, the best scene in Indiana Jones History. Onto the main part of this set,

The Minifigures:
First off, Indy as usual with his gun, whip, Sidebag and fedora, BUT he has a brand new torso, an open shirt where you can see a bit of his chest. Then, you get Marion in a new dress, the swordsman, who has one of the troll swords, tanned skin, and back printing. And, a Thug, I believe, with a little Club and the Ninja headrap. His head is the same as the grail guardians in the Venice Canal Chase set. He also has tanned skin.

The Set:
Well, start of with the Tan Barrel. That's right, Tan. Inside, is a Tommy Gun, as seen in Batman, but made out of harder plastic. It is a step in the instructions to put the gun in the barrel. Next off, the hay cart. Nothing special, quite simple, a little trailer with some hay in it. And finally, the fruit stall. You get a purple roof piece, two apples, and a gold bowl. Nothing more to say.

As said, one of my favourite sets. Although it doesn't seem like much playability, you can re-make the most awesome scene ever. If only it had a monkey.


I give it a full 10 out of 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2009-07-02T00:49:40.013Z","u can get new mini-figures here!","If u want to get 4 never-been-seen new mini-figures and new pieces that include the large tanned barrel, the 6-wide purple roof, the club, and the grey frying pan, this is a great set to buy, albeit at a premium price tag. other than that, it is a very simple set.

as a matter of fact, it is so simple, the fruit stall only has 2 green apples and an empty gold plate. i thought maybe they could have thrown in a few yellow bananas, green cherries and maybe a lettuce (like the one in the factory set ""market place"").

multiple sets will help to complete the egyptian market look, but i am not getting more than one of these, fearing that lego might come up with newer sets in the future that has the same mini-figures featured here.

"SaintElsewhere","2009-08-12T19:53:23.047Z","Where the heck is the monkey?!","I think Lego did a great job summarizing the entire Cairo scene in a 12 dollar set. We have market scenery, the haycart with machine gun, the large basket (or barrel, if you will), the thug, and the infamous swordsman. Sadly, no monkey.

Pros:
*new torso for Indy
*new torso, face for Marion (quite frankly, I think I actually prefer this face)
*new faces, torsos for bad guys (anyone else noticing a trend here?) 
*exclusive gold dish
*haven't seen a giant barrel in AGES (good thing that TLG didn't break the mold)
*swordsman is very well represented in minifig form (Personally, I always felt a little sorry for the guy. He gives Indy a free display of his skill and gets shot in return. Real nice.)

Cons:
*no monkey
*no motorcycle riding monkey man, either

Overall, a very good set. Nice quick build, attractive display item, neat minifigs, but no monkey. The monkey is so integral to the scene that I deducted a point just because he wasn't there. If you get past this oversight, then it's an almost perfect set for its price.

"capnrex","2009-07-26T11:48:09.7Z","Ambush In Cairo","A fantastic set is all that can be said really! But since that won't do I shall continue... Anyway, joking aside, this is one amazing set!

Starting on the minifigures, which are the best part of the set. We have got, Indiana Jones, without his jacket, in just an open shirt. A cairo Marion Ravenwood, The cairo Swordsman and best of all in my opinion, a cairo thug. The cairo thug is particulary good because of his great face, and his fantastic hood/headress.

The marketplace itself is also very nice, it has a tan coloured barrel, which, if you sit Marion down, can hide her almost fully. A market stall with a golden plate, two apples, two little baskets and a purple awning. Finally, you get a cart, which is very nice as it is very realistic with the bails of hay in it. Also, you get what I believe to be a Tommy Gun, this is an old piece I know, but is new to me and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised!

Overall this set would certainly be worth buying, a good price for a good set! What more can I say?

"Legonater","2009-08-20T15:59:34.14Z","""Indy!""","This set is a great version of the classic sceane that made hundreds laugh. 

To start off with, the minifigs are awesome. The thug is spectacular, extremly accurate. to add to that, the Ninja mask has a clip on the back to add a sword, but instead I gave him the Tommy gun, making it even MORE realsitic. The swordsman is also fairly accurate, although I believe he had a hood instead of a turban. The sword- as noted by many- should by the scimitar instead of this troll sword. I actually have the simitar, but it's not pearl grey. Marion is also extremly Movie-accurate, with her newe Cairo outfit. The pan is very accurate to the movie, which is why I don't (and won't) neglect it. Indiana's new desert outfit not only adds to this scerane, but add's to Temple of Doom and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as well. 

The stand is finicky, but also quite neccesary. without it, the sceane just looks bare. It also comes with the rare golden plate (Only other set that has itr is the terrible Lobster from Aqua Raider) and two brand-new apples. It brings back purple, which hasn't been seen since the X-Pods. the apples are stored in baskets that also be used as backpacks, and the table that the gold dish is on can come off to continue the background. 

The cart is also a neccesary addition. In the movie Indy throws Marion on it, but she runs away. The hay is quite blocky, and should have been made out of thin 1X4 pieces. Note: if you take out the hay you can turn it into an apple cart!

All in all a great set, with very few cons indeed. But it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2009-08-28T16:21:04.343Z","An ok buy","This set makes good use of minifigures, with the new thugs, and the marion figure. Indiana's clothes are also new, depending on if you got this set before or after the temple of doom one. The sword the turbaned thug is weilding looks awkward with him because of its overlarge size, but its no big problem. 
Large buckets like the one in this set haven't been used since the classic western ones of the 90's, but the color of it is uniqley different. This set would have been absolutely perfect if it had a monkey and an exploding vehicle, like the one in the movie. But instead they stick a crummy price on a decently good set. An annoying lego company tactic, but at the set is good enough.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"18000pieces","2009-08-26T20:49:00.297Z","""Can't we just shoot the ******?""","When Harrison Ford had a bad bout of sickness, he asked this of George Lucas and Steven Speildberg. The carefully orchestrated fight scene they had planned out was replaced by one of the most iconic scenes in Raiders: the crowd forms a circle, the swordsman steps out, grinning maliciously, and twists the sword around frighteningly well. Then Indy pulls out his gun and shoots him dead. Now this scene can be yours, for the low, low, price of $11!

To truly do the scene justice, this set would have had to be twice the size, with two more stalls, probably two more thugs, a monkey, and a lid. It would have ended up costing twenty to twenty-five dollars because of all the minifigs, and nobody would have bought it. So this is really the best way for lego to have done this scene. On to the pros and cons:

PROS
-Purple! It's been a long time since we've seen it.
-Barrel! It's a bit too big for a minifig to carry it, like in the basket game in the movie, but that doesn't matter. The barrel is awesome.
-Green apples are cool, they're pretty rare if I recall.
-Ninja head-dress is also cool. I didn't realize until I got it that it has a hook in the back for holding a weapon.
-All of the figs are great, practically little works of art. They look just like their counterparts in the movie (except for the turban, but it works for the character)
-FOUR, count them, four, amazing, unique minifigures in one small set.
-The stall is great-looking, the purple, gold, and green work really well together.
-The hay is made out of totally old-school bricks, which I think is cool. That's what lego is all about!

CONS
-This is a ten dollar set... that they're selling for eleven dollars.
-There is no lid for the barrel. It would have been so easy to include a 4x4 disk, but they didn't.
-There is no monkey! Come on LEGO, if we're going to pay the extra dollar, we should at least get a monkey.
-They used a troll sword instead of a real scimitar. If a guy is going to be an expert swordsman, don't you think he'd take better care of his sword than that?
-The cairo thug should have a sword, not a club. They had swords in the movie.
-There should have been a more secure way to hold the apples.
-The set could do with one more cairo thug, but I guess five figs in a small set is too much to ask.
-I could have used a little more detail in the stall. They had shelves in the movie, that would have been easy enough to do. They're way above the price/piece ratio here, it feels like the set should have SOMETHING else.

"mkincaid99","2009-10-02T22:20:19.153Z","Pretty Good ","Well My honest opinion(it may not matter) is it's in general awsome for a small lego set.

 -the very awsome lego minifigs
-the special turban headpiece
-the nice stand 
-the big barrel 
-the extra face for Marion

   Cons:
- It should have a person behind the stand
- why does the person attacking Marion have a STICK
- It has no monkey for Marion
- The structure of the stand is.... mini

"orybloodmyre","2010-09-02T13:58:29.963Z","Great value for money, fun, accurate depiction of movie scene","<p>This is the first Indy Set&nbsp;I purchased, and its pretty hard to criticise it to be honest. It was serious value for money what with four mini figures, an array of accessories like apples and swords. And it was&nbsp;cheap! you have to pay like three times the price to get it now, in the UK. Luckily got it when it was more common!</p>
<p>&nbsp;The only thing I dont like is the cart, as I think it doesnt look very much like hay, the random yellow bricks in the back. Having a lego camel or somthing to pull it along would be awesome though I dont know if the cart in the movie was being pulled along by anything. Im sure it was but memory fails me here!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can get it cheap go for it, as you get four exclusive minifigures, tons of awesome accessories, and an excellent depiction of one of the more humorous scenes in raiders of the lost ark.</p>

"woodall_aidan","2011-11-08T18:04:24.24Z","Nice-pricey though","This is a good set, but its pretty pricey for 79 pieces. The figures are pretty good. There's Indy, Marion, the Cairo thug and the Cairo swordsman. The little apple stand is pretty accurate to the movie, as Indy gets pushed into the stand and almost gets stabbed by the Cairo thug. The horse-drawn cart is also pretty cool, as you can also attach the cart to a horse. This set gets a 4/5.<br>",TRUE,4,3,1,2,2
"AETerry","2011-03-30T18:09:30.307Z","Ambush In Cairo Review","<p>I must confess, I bought this in December the year it came out so my then 2 year old daughter could ""give"" it to me at Christmas. The looks I got from the Grandparents who find it hard to believe their daughter is an AFOL and sometimes wonder when I'll grow up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being one of the smallest sets featured for the Indiana Jones theme, this basically reenacts an iconic scene and fight-chase in Raiders of the Lost Ark. While comparitively simple and easy to build due to it's size, it was never-the-less fun at the same time. There's just a couple elements I'd change such as adding the monkey that featured in the movie and changing out the look of the Swordsman... mainly the turban. But for a minifigure, it looks just fine and great. Maybe I'd have added one more thug to try and emphasis that Indy and Marion were outnumbered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The little fruit stall is good in offering a gold lego plate or bowl, green apples, there's a barrel that Marion is hiding in and the pan she uses to smack the thugs kidnapping her. And then a hay cart to further emphasis the market scene does alright.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a fun scene and a fund little set from LEGO and very enjoyable to pick up, even if doing so on behalf a young toddler daughter.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T10:33:09.12Z","INDY!","<p>Set #7195 Ambush in Cairo: From the second year of Indiana Jones themed sets comes this little gem, unfortunately for me it's the only set I ever managed to pick up before the stores clearanced out Indy like you wouldn't believe. But fortunately it's a good little set and here's why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all it depicts one of the classic scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indy and Marion trying to escape from the villains in the Bazarr. Secondly it includes four Mini-Figures, Indiana Jones, Marion Ravenwood, Sword Guy and Thug. Thirdly you get to have two green apples, a frying pan, a nice golden dish, a large scimitar, a machine gun, a pistol and Indy's trademark whip. And last, but not least, it's a cheap way to get the Indiana Jones mini-figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the small fruit stand and the cart is all you build with this set, it doesn't take that much time, but when it's finished it looks great and there are loads of possible play options for you. The heroes can buy some fruit and then escape the villains on the cart (Unlike in the film.), you could have both of them captured, or you could just take them and put them into a larger display and have an excellent looking piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indy's whip is springy so you can uncurl it and pretend he's whipping at the bad guy, or wrap it around his cutlass and pull it from his hand. (With some help from you of course.) Indy's shoulder bag is a nice new accessory that stands out and looks great, the sword wielding goon has a black turban while the other masked guy comes with a Ninja mask, complete with storage space for his club.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this set is well worth the effort to find and pick up. Plus I always loved that scene from the first movie, and at 12.99$ you really can't go wrong.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"JtheMonk","2011-02-19T09:21:37.26Z","Some Of These Small Sets Have the Best Value","<p>It's amazing how much atmosphere and playability has been crammed into 79 pieces here. As well as four top-notch minifigures, you get molded guns, a sword, a barrel, a frying pan, a cudgel, and some fruit (what more could you really ask for? Maybe a camel or donkey to pull the hay cart, but that's about it). The faux-gold bowl is also a nice touch, and it looks good with the touch of purple on the stall roof and the green of the apples.<br></p><p>When you look at how many minifigures and elements they can pack into a 
set for $10.99, it's hard to understand why the bigger sets have to be 
exponentially more expensive.</p><p>Obviously, there's nothing too complicated or involved in the building process, as the little fruit stall is the most complex construction job here and that's going to take about four minutes at most. Everything looks good once it's built, but the build itself isn't too exciting. These small sets have a much higher playability to build time ratio than the larger sets, so if you're looking for something to display or impress your friends with, you should probably look somewhere else.<br></p><br>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5

"Cult_Of_Skaro","2016-12-15T23:43:03.933Z","Don't bring a sword to a gunfight","<p>I initially got this set having never seen the movie, and even then I loved it. Even as a fan of LEGO who had no knowledge of Indiana Jones&nbsp;it held a lot of appeal. While the parts included are few, they are generally fairly uncommon; the purple canopy appears only in four sets, and the tan barrel is unique to this set. Pieces such as the apples, while relatively common, generally appear in much larger sets, and are thus more difficult to acquire. Additionally, the set comes with a whopping four minifigures, all of which are unique,&nbsp;which is quite a lot for a set that only cost $11.</p>

<p>The set is even more enjoyable, however, after seeing the movie. Most notably, it includes the two main characters of the movie, while being the cheapest set in the wave. In addition to this, it recreates what is possibly the most iconic scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark, when Indiana Jones defeats an enemy swordsman with a pistol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the original price of $11, this set is a no-brainer. It comes with four exclusive minifigures, a variety of useful parts and accessories, and recreates a famous scene from a beloved movie. At the current market price of around $20, its appeal is less obvious. I would recommend picking it up at a price of around $15.</p>
