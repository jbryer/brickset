"skipp","2009-06-27T12:39:42.56Z","Chauchilla Cemetery Battle","Well, I bought this set last week on a NATO Airbase in Germany for about 20â‚¬. The set includes 5 minifigures, a new bike, and the cemetery. It's relatively easy to build, you get one booklet, and you can take the cemetery apart into two pieces.

Minifigures:
Indiana Jones, as always comes with his sidebag, wip, handgun and Fedora. But, he has a brand new face. It's almost the same as Mutt's, but has a few beard stubbles. Mutt, is the same as found in other KOTKS sets. And then, the two...Cemetery Warriors. They have dual sided faces, one of them with a little skull mask, and they have brand new tanned skin. One of them comes with a blowpipe, the other with a 'chainsaw'. You also get a skeleton (see more later)

The Bike:
It's actually quite nice, the new body is black and reed, and you add some bags to the back yourself.

The Cemetery itself:
Not much to say. At the font you have some ladders, with a hidden area under it, where the warriors can dart around in, like the movie. Then, you have a little wall, that can turn over, like in the movie, a hidden one. And at the end, you have a skeleton with a conquistador Helmet, some pearl armour and the newer arms. Behind him is the crystal skull. In the same room is a gold treasure chest with some emeralds and a gold cup.


So overall, it's in interesting set, you get a little playability, some awesome figures, a shiney new bike, and a cemetery. Overall, 7/10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2009-07-14T00:26:15.607Z","i only like the bike and the new indy smiling face.","i like this set for the following reasons:

1. the bike looks awesome! i wish this set includes the vintage yellow school bus, instead of the cemetery.

2. indy shows his teeth here, and that's the only new thing about him.

3. accessories include: saw, dagger, gems, gold cups, flames, spade, whip, crystal skull, spider and scorpions, skeleton in armour, gold chest, stick for a dart blower(huh?), green leafy plants, etc.

4. the cemetery can be separated into 2 parts for easy storage.

5. an interesting trapdoor that leads into the chamber(?) and a hiding place underneath that platform at the front.

there are drawbacks:

1. cemetery looks lame and unimpressive even though it is quite long (29 studs).

this is probably the weakest set in the current IJ wave.

"indykid","2009-08-11T18:26:13.797Z","A Must Have","This set is so great. I ordered it on Amazon on a Thursday afternoon. It said 3-5 business days until it arrived but it got here on Tuesday morning. 

Minifigs: Indy w/ bag and whip (and new opened mouth grin), Mutt, 2 cemetary warriors w/ tan skin and switchable faces.

Motorcycle (yes it gets it own section): Best part. It has great red stripes and exhaust pipe. cool brown bags on the sides also. 

Cemetary: Neat little hiding area for warriors. little area for scorpion attack. flippable wall. switch for flippable wall is poorly designed though. 

Treasure room (OOOH, AAAH, SPECIAL!): W/o accessories its pretty bland. but there is a conquistador skeleton with silver armour and cool helmet. there is a little space behind the skeleton to put the crystal skull. there is also a spider web w/ spider next to a gold treasure chest. oh and two flames at the entrance.

Accessories (the part that makes the set): whip, two knives, two pistols, cool chainsaw thing that one of the warriors has, handy dandy blowdart, two scorpions for scorpion area, spider (as previously stated), gold treasure chest (listed above), two emeralds and a gold goblet for treasure chest, other gold goblet placed in the corner of the treasure room, and last but not least the Crystal Skull. 

Build: Very easy build, didn't take long, it might take you shorter to build because I was watching Rat Race while I was building it. See? I can multitask. Jealous? just kidding. but I was watching Rat Race and was semi-distracted.

Playability: lots of playability, treasure room and cemetary split apart easily for more playability.

Overall: 11.3/10 only because of the bike. It would be 12 but the poorly designed switch for the flippable door marked it down by .7 points. 
Easly build. Great for New builders. Highly reccommended to anyone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"dk_devilkid","2009-08-18T13:25:34.95Z","I can't think of anything to put here other than a great set.","That title may have been boring but the set is not. This set comes with Mutt's bike (yes!) which is partly why I love this set. The other main additions are the crystal skull and the cemetary warriors. This is my first crystal skull so that made my day. The cemetary warriors are cool because they have two faces (one with the mask on, one without).

Another cool thing would have to be the chainsaw thing one warrior wields. I was also happy with the armored skeleton (Oriana I think was his name). Behind him hides the crystal skull. On the set itself are two ladder looking things that the warriors can ambush Indy and Mutt from. To finish it it off it has a rotating platform that can bring someone from one room to the other.

Pros:
Indy, Mutt, and 2 cemetary warriors.
Mutt's bike.
2 traps (If you could call them that).
The crystal skull.
Cool weapons for them all.

Cons:
Can't think of any.

"Lego_Minifig_Man","2009-08-24T17:06:14.183Z","Pretty Good Set, and the Crystal Skull is awsome!","    This set is a great, lots of accessories, and two exclusive minifigs, AND the new Indy! The boxes at the store were all damaged, so I took the one with only a small dent in the top. I had to take a few off the shelf to find this one. Anyway, on to the Pros & Cons!


Pros:

- The RARE Crystal Skull 

- The skull can fit on a minifigure's body

- The secret passageway fliping action works!

- Certain Pieces (i.e the flames, circle thing, both ladders, the lantern handle, and the plants)

- Minifig Hand Items (i.e the two small knives, the shovel, lantern, chainsaw-thing, whip, and the two revolvers)

- Conquistador Skeleton minifig has a cool hat & armor
 
- Two ""Cemetary Warrior"" minifigs exclusive to this set

- The ""Cemetary Warriors"" have two faces, one normal and the other a skull  mask 

- Indy has a new face, which is pretty much just Mutt's but with Indy's beard-thing and a slightly different mouth

- Mutt's motorcycle with saddle bags! (Best lego motorcycle yet!)

- The two gold goblets (Either one can be used as the Holy Grail)

- Both of the scorpions

- Two green jewels

- The Spider and the Spider's web

- The gold treasure chest



Cons:

- The lever for the passageway can fall out too easily

- All the plant pieces are the same

- Mutt's motorcycle needs a headlight. Maybe a clear yellow 1x1 stud would do.

- The jewels are both the same color

- The crystal skull has a weird looking blue brain and that is the only colored thing on it that is not clear

- I highly doubt that there would be a gold-colored treasure chest in a secret chamber

- There is nothing to attach to the four things on the arch over the crystal skull hiding place


Conclusion:
This is a pretty good set. The main set part (the normal bricks part) is a bit boring. I'd give it 3.6 stars if I could, so I just gave it 3. I'd reccomend it to be someone's first-time licensed set.

"sudorum","2009-08-28T16:00:03.937Z","Somewhat Miniscule","Once again, the Indiana Jones sets feature great minifigs. The two guardians have dual faces, one is the skull mask, the other is just normal.&nbsp;They also have  the new tan skin color that Mola Ram and the guardians of the holy grail have. As for the set itself... it's kinda small. I would have liked it to be somewhat larger, but Lego always feels the need to downgrade scenes from movies. The middle of the cemetery includes the moving platform from the movie, which works quite well. Behind the platform is the conquistador skeleton who hides the crystal skull behind him. There's also a random treasure chest with a cup and two green diamonds. Mutt's motorcycle is muy coolio and basically the highlight of the set.",FALSE,3,4,3,2,4

Compared to the rest of the '09 sets (January '09 included) I've built, the Cemetery Battle is disappointingly average. While there are several redeeming qualities including the crystal skull, cemetery warriors, and Mutt's Harley; there are also several flaws, not the least of which being the flimsy structure and Indy's new face. (I absolutely HATE, HATE, HATE that godawful face!) Sadly, this set just comes short of the quality of excellence enjoyed by the likes of 7195 Ambush in Cairo, 7197 Venice Canal Chase, and 7682 Shanghai Chase. Too bad. If the designers had applied themselves a bit more to this set, it could have been great.

Pros:
*scorpions (haven't seen those in a while)
*conquistador armor (haven't seen that in a while, either)
*spiderweb (see above two points)
*the crystal skull is (next to the golden idol from 7623) the best piece to grace the IJ line
*double-face cemetery warriors are incredible
*Mutt's motorcycle is great
*little bunker for the warriors to hide in is a nice touch

Cons:
*for a spooky ancient South American grave yard, this set is very sparse
*Indy's new face makes me want to gouge out my eyes (hopefully this and 7199 are the only sets they EVER use it in)
*cemetery is very flimsy (I dare you to try lifting it with one hand. Go on, I dare ya.)
*the little lever that turns the stone-for lack of a better word-door just won't stay in
*Why in the world does Orellana have those bizarre Star Wars arms?

I think if TLG had included another grave or two, you know, just as scenery, this set could've been quite a bit better. Ah well, I've still 5 days of summer to improve it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legomakes3","2009-11-15T16:52:29.5Z","Fight for the Crystal Skull","I bought this wonderful set today at Value Drugs, my local DRUGSTORE! Yes, I mean DRUGSTORE! The toy department buyer at my local drugstore thought that buying LEGO toys would boost up the department's popularity. And, YES, it did! Not just for me and my younger brothers, but for kids that are walking down the aisles freely, and them screaming to their mothers or fathers ""MOM, DAD, THEY HAVE LEGO!""

Now, after that little FYI, it is time to go on to review this 2009 Indiana Jones set. I received it from my grandmother for a great marking period report card. The drugstore gets LEGO sets and stocks them out ever 2-4 weeks. And when I went today, they had sets like the Indiana Jones sets I am reviewing now, the Pirates Kraken Attack, the Space Police impulses (NO INTEREST TO ME! :(), City impulses including the new BBQ Stand (which I got a few days ago), Bionicle playsets (for anyone interested), and Duplo sets! There are so many more, I can't even list them! So I got the Chauchilla Cemetery Battle, a set from my 2009 wanted list!

Pros:

*5 mini-figures. Indiana Jones with a new grin, Mutt Williams (my first in my collection), two new cemetery warrioes (with the return of the LEGO Harry Potter hairs), and an explorer skeleton protecting the Crystal Skull (the return of the Pirates Armada helmet! What could this mean?? Hmmm....)

*Buildable sections. This made it easier to build in under 20 minutes, and also way more fun to play and enjoy with!

*A crystal skull and rare pieces. The Crystal Skull is great, with a little bit weird blue brain! My first! There are also some rare pieces, as I mentioned before, with a Pirates Armada helmet and Harry Potter hair pieces!

*Great scene represenatives! The part where Indy and Mutt use the rock mechanism to get to the burial ground is re-created EXACTLY, with the circular piece on top of a regular studded mini-base!

*Animal invasions! Scorpions and spiders!

Cons:

*HORRIBLE INDY FACE! The new grin works well with the Temple of Doom set, but not with this one! Indiana Jones never had this face in KOTCS! If TLC wanted to make an extreme face, make the beard GREY, and forgot the horrible face design!

*Somewhat WEAK when carrying place to place. You can't bring this set to different places, because it will SNAP in HALF! THAT IS NOT PRETTY!

I think this Indy set is one of the best, and I am so happy that I had the chance to get it this year! Let's see if they still have it out in 2010, a second one might be an option..... :P

"kaboomlegoman","2010-02-14T17:52:45.827Z","Okay set.","This is a really good set. It's cool because it has a crystal skull for this price.


Building: I gave this set five because it has many archways, but release this in a bigger set, give it walls, etc. and the building would be WAY more fun.


Pieces: No cool pieces. The only one that makes this set deserve a 4 is the crystal skull.


Playability: Well, to tell the truth, the Chauchilla warriors are supposed to be jumping out. But what really stinks about this stupid tecqniqe ( Please, I don't know how to spell some words.) is that the space is very limited. You can only fit one, have to take off his weapon, and he barely fits. But the turning disc thing is really cool and does work.


Price: Just standard( The best price I've ever seen is Beach House's)


Overall: An okay set, but could be better. I don't care much for Indiana Jones, and really don't care that it's ending, but the problem is, whenever I get an IJ set, I feel all the bad flaws could be put in a bigger set and released as a flaw-less, very cool set. That's why I actually do care if this theme starts to end( A little bit, at least) and a bigger set could be released.",FALSE,3,4,5,4,4

"asteciuc","2009-11-02T01:06:10.06Z","Mixed Opinion","The set obviously presents some very interesting pieces that go a long way no matter what your pleasure in Lego is. I bought the set for the two Cemetery Guardians and their amazing two headed faces and was not disappointed. The motorcycle is a very nice touch and the rustic Spanish breastplate and helmet haven't been seen in a while. Two scorpions are also included which I did not notice until I opened the set. However with the good comes the bad.

Cons:

1. Indy's face is ugly. There's no way around it. He has this stupid grin on his face that makes me wish Mutt would hit him with that shovel.

2. The set doesn't stay together and is very easy to break. Particularly around the two brown plates with the skeleton in the back, as well as with the main connectors. 

3. Indy does not fit through the trapped door unless you twist his hat at a certain angle. 

4. The stupid switch that you use to flip Indy falls at whenever you bump the set or move it.

5. The hair for the Cemetery Guardians do not cover the skull faces on the back of their heads.

6. The Crystal Skull does not look at all like it does on the cover. I was particularly disappointed by this since I really wanted the skull from this set because it looked unique. It does not have a blue-ish tint as the pictures would suggest. It has a blue blob in it that is surrounded by clear plastic. That is all.

7. OPTIONAL: This is just a pet peeve of mine but I hate the golden treasure chest and I now have 6 of them.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<ul>
<li>Front section(left) has hiding area for Cemetary guardians. There are two ways to come out (left and right) w/small ladders that tilt open/close covering each opening.</li>
<li>Mid-section has a neat hidden/tilting wall in which you stand your mini-fig on and using a small technique pin and gear you tilt/flip your figure for the left cemetary section into the tomb area (right).<em> </em></li>
<li>In the tomb area of the playset (right side) you have a gold chest to the&nbsp;left with spider web behind it and straight ahead is the skeleton remains of Francisco de Orellana, a Spanish conquistador. Move him and voila'...behind his remains&nbsp;reveals a crystal skull!<em> </em></li>
<li>Mutts Harley Davidsons motorcycle with body that snaps onto chassis and rubber tires. Nicely design.</li>
<li>Accessories galore...blow-dart stick, chainsaw, 2 scorpions, Indy's hat, whip and saddle bag, 2 pistols, 2 knives, shovel, nice brick built lantern, 2 flame pieces,&nbsp;4 grass/foliage pieces, gold chest, 2 green gems, 2 gold goblets, spider web, black spider, knight/conquistador body armor(silver), conquistador helmet(black) and rare Crystal Skull (transparent with blue brain seen within)!</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mini-figs are your standard Indiana Jones character(hat, whip, saddle-bag)&nbsp;with new face print(looks like Mutt only with stubble. I guess saying they're related), standard Mutt(should give him black hands like he has leather gloves on in the movie), skeleton (standard skeleton representing a conquistador)&nbsp;with black helmet and body armor and 2 Chauchilla Cemetary guardians with tan skin, duel faces (one normal while the other has a nicely design skull mask).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CON's...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Personally for me, this set is just way too small for the scene it's representing from the movie. Missing here are many stone staircases, more hiding areas for the Cemetary guardians, tomb in movie was much larger and contained more conquistador knights and gems, jewels. The hidden/tilting stone doorway was much bigger in the film. Overall this playset is too small and simplistic compared to the scene it's taken from.</li>
<li>Small quibble, Mutt's motorcycle doensn't have a headlight. Easily fixed with a trans-clear stud.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall it's a nice playset for your kid, fun and easy build while for the AFoL, loads of parts and accessories to add to your MoC's. Stand out being the rare Crystal Skull and Mutt's motorcycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I <strong>recommend </strong>this playset for your kid (6 yrs. old on up should have no trouble putting this together with minor help), AFoL's for parts, accessories,etc. and for guys like me...I've modified this set by expanding it to include a larger tomb and layed out an area to incorporate staircases&nbsp;with more hiding areas for the guardians.</em></p>
