"jgptee","2009-06-19T00:57:28.25Z","probably the best set in the current IJ wave.","i like this set for the following reasons:

1. 4 entirely new mini-figures that includes new suits, new hats and a new blonde glam hairdo. 

2. 2 solid well-built boats that at first glance looks to be the same, but are totally different in terms of build, colour and playability. one is able to split into 2 cleanly, while the other has a detailed engine that blows out. the boats are 21 long and 6 wide, so they are quite large actually, and not that small.

3. there is the overhead bridge with a platform on one side that collapses when u trigger it. also, there is a manhole on the other side of the bridge that can be opened to hide one mini-figure.

4. it is a very detailed, beautiful set, that reminds u of the water city.

5. high playability full of explosive actions. 

6. great accessories: 4 guns (includes machine gun), 1 mouse, 1 whip (standard), 1 extra hair-piece for Indy (standard) and 1 map.

7. no stickers!

however, there is something i dun like:

1. the boat seat can only sit one properly, instead of 2 as shown on the box art. to squeeze 2, u have to tilt them sideways. but it does not affect play. there is small area at the back of the boat that can sit 1 mini-figure.

overall, this is a great set! it is a must buy!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Harm1","2009-07-18T05:12:08.983Z","My favourite set ever!","I only got out of my dark ages half a year ago, so maybe I'm not aware of great sets in the last few years. Still, this my favourite set I ever owned! Here's why:

Looks: The entire set just looks really nice on display.

Colour Scheme: The colour schemes on the boats and the rest of the set go really really nice together. 

Pieces: At least 80% of the pieces in this set will be very usefull in Moc's of many different kinds.

Minifigs: I'm not really into minifigs, but these ones are new and have lovely weapons and the new fez piece.

Special effects: What really makes this set stand out are the 3(!!) explosion-like special effects that allow you to reenact scenes of the movie. Not only do the explosions look really well, they are conceiled in an amazing way. In terms of boobytraps I feel each of these are among the best lego has ever made. 

Pros: all of the above
Cons: none

Really, even if you don't like Indiana Jones at all, this set is a must have. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ant","2009-07-23T11:28:47.797Z","Fun Set","Bought this set on an impulse - I really wanted a set from the new IJ wave.

This set has alot of value for both parts and minifig collectors -
 a) There is alot of dark tan in one of the boats. Both studless and studded    plates. I've seen hundreds of posts on various forums of AFOLs drooling over dark tan pieces.
b) 2 new minifig parts - the fez's on the brotherhood guys are amazing. When I first see these kind of modified parts in pictures online I worry that TLC is deviating away from the standard system of parts, but these hats are really great and I can see how they could be incorporated in a lot of other sets. 
Elsa's hairpiece is also new, although it is available in the new Camper Van, here it is in blonde, a colour I've noticed is exclusive to Indiana Jones sets

Pro's:
- Lots of dark tan
- New minifig parts
- BOTH boats have DIFFERENT play features (one's engine explodes, the other gets cut in half)
- Great scene set

Con's:
- Nowhere to store Indy's hat or whip",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"lotographia","2009-07-23T05:13:10.513Z","Exploding boats ahoy.","Being more a fan of models than gimmicks, I appreciate it when the designs of Lego sets disguise the machinations of the gimmicks in order to preserve the integrity of the model. The pier does this well, as does the boat with black flag. The boat with the red flag... not so much. The button is quite clearly a button. Fortunately the model is easy to redesign so that this is no longer a problem.

My other criticism of the set is that the boats can only seat one minifig, despite having two seats. The passenger seat is essentially useless, just for show. Lego still needs to design a double seater for minifigs that doesn't just belong in vintage cars. Because of these flaws I don't feel I can give the set five stars, though I would like to.

On the plus side, this set has a new suit for Indy (Yay!), Elsa Schnieder (Yay!) and two new Grail Protectors (Yay!) with the new fez headpiece. Is it just me, or is that fez piece gonna be included as decoration in lots of sets from now on? Like, as the base of a pillar, or the base of a plant, or any other places that a truncated cone might come in handy. I'm just saying.

Anyway, as to the models... I love how the two boats are essentially exactly the same, but have completely different gimmicks, different colours schemes and slightly different features, like the control panels at the front. They could have been slightly bigger perhaps, but these licensed sets are expensive enough as it is.

These models aren't quite as authentic as the two in the fighter plane attack set, but all the new minifigs win me over.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"indyman09","2009-09-13T10:53:55.217Z","great special features!","I have this set since yesterday.
It's a great set.

It's really nice to build, the bridge and the rest round that are really nice to build and you can also use it in your city. the boats are really good. there are lots of new pieces for me in them. What also is good is that there are lots of brown pieces. You can use that in other buildings.
What I don't like about the boats are the seats, one minifigure has to sit really wyrd. Lucky lego has maked another place to sit on the back of the boats.
What you can do to fix the seat problem is: Let Elsa stear in the boat and push Indy's legs back till the can't further, now let him sit with his back to the front of the boat. Now you can sit good with two people and Indy can shoot Kazim better in this position.
OK, look at my title and you know what is the best of this set, the special features. as you push on the end of the left sight of the bridge than the wooden thing on the left will blow away! the special things on the boats are really cool!
If you push on the back of the brighter boat than the middle wooden things came of and a piece of the engine! In the other boat: push on the piece what came of and the boat split in two (just like in the movie, when the boat cames in the giant propellor of a boat).
The minifigures are also great!
You can use the hats of the grail guardians to make Salah, how he is on the end of the last crusade movie.
The new hairpiece of Elsa is really good!
I also like the new outfit of Indiana jones.

So, this is a great set, you must have it even if you're not an indiana jones fan.
The only cons I have are: the seating problem, but this can be easily fixed.
And one thing I live in Holland and i buy this set for â‚¬39,95 that's something of 58,30 bucks, it's a bit expensive but it's worth it!

I was intrigued by the licensed LEGO products, namely Star Wars and Indy, but quickly thereafter purchased a bunch of Space Police 3 sets in addition to more Indy sets.</div><div><br></div><div>This set represents the scene from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade where Indy and Elsa Schneider are running for their lives from mysterious assailants seemingly bent on keeping them away from the secrets of the 'Holy Grail'. The chase continues from the hidden catacombs they find under an old church turned library into the streets and waterways of Venice, where both parties board speedboats.</div><div><br></div><h4>Figures</h4><div>The four figures here represent those that take part in the speedboat chase through the canals of Venice. Each is unique to this set, not available in any other.</div><div><ul><li><b>Indiana Jones</b> - Dressed in his gray 'traveling' suit, Indy still looks the part with his brown fedora, revolver and whip.</li><li><b>Elsa Schneider</b> - Indy's companion in the search or Sir Richard's tomb (and assistant to Indy's father) is done justice in her white shirt with blue pinstripes. She features a reversible head, one with a smiley face, the other side with a panic-stricken print.</li><li><b>Kazim</b> - Apparent leader of the 'Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword', Kazim is represented here in his gray pinstriped suit and red carnation. His dark red Fez adorns his head, along with his fu-manchu style mustache.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Grail Guardian</b> - Although he is given the same torso as Kazim even though Kazim is the only member that wears a carnation in his lapel, for the sake of consistency. He's given a different face print with a van dyke beard to differentiate him from Kazim, as everything else is identical.</li></ul></div><h4>Accessories</h4><div><ul><li><b>Revolver</b> - Indy's trusty (except when it's not) sidearm is here again.</li><li><b>Semi-Automatic Pistol</b> - Given to the Grail Guardian, this reappropriation of the 'Hose Nozzle' piece makes a fine representation of a Luger type of pistol.</li><li><b>Machine gun</b> - Not representative of the type of gun used in the chase, which had a single long cartridge that stuck out the side, this 'Tommy Gun' type of machine gun does the trick in a pinch.</li><li><b>Whip</b> - Indy's signature whip is always by his side, especially when his gun isn't.</li><li><b>Fedora</b> - THE signature accessory for the&nbsp;</li><li><b>Map</b> - A good idea, if not very representative of anything in the movie.</li></ul><h4>Parts</h4></div><div>There are a lot of parts in popular colors here, including a plethora of tan, dark brown and dark reddish-brown tiles used for the decking of the boats and the dock. The curved windshield (originally from Speed Racer sets) is a great piece that is used to good effect on each boat. Add a modicum of dark red/brown hull pieces and slope bricks and a lot of light blue/gray pieces and you've got yourself a rather full set! At 420 pieces for $40 you have a licensed set that gets below the $0.10/piece golden ratio, which is astounding!</div><div>Printed pieces include:</div><div><ul><li>2x2 tile w/map pattern in tan</li><li>1x4 tile w/knobs and dials in dark blue/gray</li><li>1x2 tile w/yellow and white gauges in light blue/gray</li></ul></div><h4><meta charset=""utf-8""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; ""><h4 style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 1.1em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; "">Action Features</h4><div>There are three action features - one for each 'part' of the set. The boat with the dark tan upper deck features a button in the middle that actually cuts the last third of the boat off. On a smooth surface, it can actually shoot away quite rapidly due to the action of the button moving against the friction of three technic pins.</div><div>The other boat has an 'exploding engine' feature that also works in spectacular fashion. When the rear 'seat' is depressed the middle of the deck and two separate levels of the engine blast apart.</div><div>Finally, the dock has an 'exploding' feature as well, flipping backwards when a button is pressed at the back, near where it connects to the bridge.</div></span></h4><h4>Build</h4><div>While strikingly similar at first glance aside from coloration, the two boats are actually constructed quite differently in order to accommodate their distinct action features. The boat with the 'exploding engine' action is necessarily hollow to accommodate the engine pieces, while the break-in-half (well, one third and two thirds) boat is more solidly constructed to facilitate the two pieces connecting together.&nbsp;</div><div>It's a little disappointing that they aren't truly two-seaters; Since the boats are 6 studs wide, the seats are right up against each-other, causing one figure to sit flush and the other to have to lean over. This can look good for 'action poses' but still, a relatively sore spot.</div><div>The build on the bridge and dock is strong, using dark reddish brown and tan tiles for the steps and decking, and light blue/gray parts for the stonework and bridge&nbsp;arch.</div><meta charset=""utf-8""><h4>Authenticity</h4><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#AD1808"" size=""4""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;""><b><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""3""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px;"">The speedboats in the movie come to more of a point when viewed from the top, and from the side are more square than the pieces used can replicate. It would've been fairly difficult to pull off with existing pieces, so what we get is passable. The colors are authentic, although both boats have white stripes adorning their flags, which are solid red and black in the set.&nbsp;</span></font></b></span></font></div><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#AD1808"" size=""4""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;""><b><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""3""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px;"">The action features themselves both kind of accurately depict how the one boat is torn to shreds by a large spinning propeller - chopping the back third off the boat, and then chomping into it more, sending pieces of the deck and engine up in the air - that these two things, then, happen to two separate boats isn't too accurate, but the coolness factor outweighs the authenticity factor here.</span></font></b></span></font></div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>The Indy line seemed to have quite a few sets where vehicles came in pairs, with opposing factions manning one or the other: Two <a href=""/detail/?Set=7620-1"">motorcycles</a>;&nbsp;two&nbsp;<a href=""/detail/?Set=7682-1"">cars</a>;&nbsp;two <a href=""/detail/?Set=7198-1"">airplanes</a>&nbsp;- here we have two boats! It's an interesting commentary not only of the way the LEGO Indy sets were devised, but how the movies were written!</div><div>This set is highly recommended if you are a fan of the Indiana Jones movies. It's rather authentic, has figures you can't find anywhere else (aside from resellers, naturally) and you could even find it on clearance, as some locations still have some amount of Indy sets. At full price it's still a great deal, so on clearance you shouldn't pass it up.</div><meta charset=""utf-8""><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"Fiona_W","2010-01-12T11:02:24.75Z","Venice Cannal Chase - A Review","  5 stars out of 5. It earns this dignity from the boats. The boat with the red flag has a a Lego piece to act as a button, when you push it down, you can pull out the back without breaking the rest. The other boat has, at the back a place for people to sit down, but if you push down too far, then part of the boat flips off. 
  
  An easy build for a good builder and a perfect one if you want to start a new hobby. It includes 4 Mini Figgers, Dr Jones in a suit, Elsa the Librarian and the two enemies.  
  
  On the bridge where the pier is, if you put someone on the pier and the push the cream bit down ( not too hard ) they will flip off along with the pier, but that is meant to happen.
 
  I have enjoyed building and playing with this set, and hope you do too.

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-01-10T05:54:00.467Z","Absolutely beautiful set with amazing play features!","<p>This is perhaps the most visually appealing Lego set that I own. What makes it even more amazing is that it has some incredible play features that work perfectly and in no way detract from the looks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You get Indy wearing a suit, which is nice for a change. He isn&rsquo;t as instantly recognizable as a typical Indy, and you could argue he is generic, but if you already have him in several other sets, then this is a very welcome change. Elsa has an absurd cartoonish look on her face, it is downright ugly. I would complain about this as the one detractor from an otherwise beautiful set,&nbsp;but&nbsp;given who and what she really is, it is fitting that she is this ugly. The two grail guards are nearly identical except for their thick facial hair and look very true to the movie, I especially like the fez.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Model</b></p>

<p>This is what makes the set amazing. The boats are beautiful, as beautiful as the boats in the movie. They come in two colors to differentiate them, and they both feature an amazing play feature. One of them you push a button and the back goes flying off. The other has a lever that sends the boards and engine flying. Best of all, neither the button nor the lever detract at all from the design. Now all you need is a giant prop to put the boats under.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Venice bridge is also fantastic looking, not a doubt that you are looking at Venice. On one side you have a manhole cover for Indy and Elsa to climb out of (along with a rat). The other features a dock that can be destroyed with the push of a lever (although it doesn&rsquo;t work quite as well as the boat features). To go along with it are two posts to tie up to. Normally I would think of this build as secondary to the boats, but not the case in this set, this build is definitely an equal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout the attention to detail is amazing, down to the fenders both on the boats and land. The colors are amazing, couldn&rsquo;t look any better. I only have one minor problem with the set and that is that you have two seats side by side in each boat which requires you to position the minifigures carefully and have their arms in awkward positions to seat both of them. The other issue is that with such amazing attention to detail, it would have been nice if they had included lines and cleats to tie up with, although that would be very difficult at this scale.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>This set is a relatively simple and straightforward build, but still a lot of fun. The two boats are different enough that it doesn&rsquo;t feel repetitive. The play features, especially popping the back of the boat off, certainly keeps you interested in how they did it. A rather enjoyable build given that no individual part of it is all that large.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Parts&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Beyond the specialty parts for the boats, hull and windshield, there isn&rsquo;t anything too special. There are lots of tiles in various wood colors which I can see being very useful. My only disappointment with the parts is that it includes a 2x2 tile with a printed map, it would have been much more appropriate if the print featured the rubbing of the knight&rsquo;s shield.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>This is an absolutely wonderful set. Even if you aren&rsquo;t an Indiana Jones fan, it is a wonderful depiction of Venice. Like I said, I&rsquo;ve never seen a more beautiful Lego set. When you add in the excellent play features and the unique minifigures, I really don&rsquo;t think you could find a better set. Certainly this might be the one Indiana Jones set that would look great on display, but you will want to take it down all the time to play with it. No doubt that this is my favorite Indiana Jones set, and one of my favorite Lego sets period.&nbsp;I highly recommend this set for any Indiana Jones fan as well as any boaters.&nbsp;</p>
