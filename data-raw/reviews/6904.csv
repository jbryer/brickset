"BrianOg","2009-06-28T17:35:30.437Z","Very Cool Dogfighting Kit","First off I think this is obviously the best propellor 'plane type set LEGO has produced, yet. 

As usual with the Indy line of sets, the vehicals are extremely well built - a progression of small pieces that build a very solid foundation, and lots of quite realistic features. In this respect the build was easily as good as 7622 ""Race for the Stolen Treasure"" (which features some of the best cars/trucks LEGO has done IMHO). Build took about an hour, there are some stickers so you need to be careful putting those on, you don't want them askew. 

Minifigs: exactly the same as in ""motorcycle chase"" (which I already have two of), so they do the job perfectly, even if they're not terribly exciting. Dr Jones Sr gets a briefcase, so at least thats something. I guess most people will fill these 'planes up with soldiers anyways. Three little revolvers included too - those always come in handy. 

Biplane: looks very nice, great swooshability - but be careful of those stickers - they seem to be attached to all of the obvious points on the plane that you would hold it by when swooshing. It looks great from the front, and in profile, but if you look from directly above or below, you notice how chunky the tail-end is, it lacks a little tapering (which would admittedly require some fancy building techniques we are unlikely to see in a regular set aimed mainly at kids). So overall a quite beautiful biplane, good realism overall, very nice rear guns, with a slightly chunky tail-end (and I'm being picky).

Grey monoplane (a Messerchmidt BF-109 I presume) - quite a heavy little 'plane, very solid construction. I like the front and the wings, the open cockpit is fine too, but again, even more so than on the biplane, the tail section is quite stumpy. Too bad, but it is a LEGO set, not Airfix. The undercarriage is not great, uglier than on the biplane, which doesn't have a wonderful undercarriage either. Neither aircraft has any tailwheel, but thats pretty easily added on for those who insist I guess. The wings falling off function is very cool - you just press the rear cockpit glass down, and out they pop (allowing for reinactment of the chase scene, where Indy and Jones Sr go into a tunnel and the plane tries to follow them. I suppose the sportscar from Shanghai chase could come in handy for this). On the other hand, it destabilizes the wing attachments - they hang on by virtue of a couple of technic pins - so swooshing is not as good as on the biplane, bit its not a huge deal. 

One piece was missing for the Messerschmidt cockpit - a grey 2x1 slate with the pilot's controls on it - I'll have to call LEGO up to send me one. 

Sorry for such a long review, I'm chuffed this is the first review up here, a great set overall, with far more pros than cons. I'll give it a five anyway, even though I have mentioned its weaker points. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2009-07-04T10:04:44.687Z","2 authentic vintage planes in one set","i like this set for the following reasons:

1. 2 very cool vintage WW2 planes as featured in the movie. one is a red and white bi-plane, and the other is a dark grey fighter plane (with bombs and guns). the fighter plane is much bigger than the bi-plane. actually, both look much larger than what u see on the box art. in fact, the fighter plane is only slightly shorter than the dc3 in the ""peril in peru"" set.

2. high playability, full of explosive actions.

3. the bi-plane is very solid, seats 2 mini-figures, and has a big gun mounted on it. it has a storage compartment for the hand guns and henry's suitcase. it is very detailed.

4. the grey fighter plane seats only one pilot, has detachable wings to re-enact the tunnel scene in the movie, and comes with 4 missiles/bombs, which are very securely fitted under the wings and do not come off when you tilt the plane forward or backwards.

however there are a few drawbacks:

1. 3 mini-figures which can also be found in the cheaper and ever-so-popular ""motorcycle cycle chase"" set.

2. the planes do not have the small back-wheels, so they rest on their bare bottoms, but this can be easily corrected.

3. the grey fighter plane cockpit seats only 1 (not 2) mini-figure. the back seat is a dummy to trigger the detachment of the wings. still cool, but i wish the seat is real. the cockpit looks weird too. it is angular and not smooth with the shape of the plane. also, the sides of the cockpit are not completely covered.

i like vintage planes, so i've added this to my collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rick76","2009-07-25T23:15:28.64Z","Incredible and quite realistic Set","I dont have the words to describe the beauty of this set, I honestly never thought i will actually see a Fighter plane build by Lego for a real set. 

The lines in both planes are so good that they look like Collector models but in Minifig Scale.  The only con is that neither one carries a tail landing gear, but thatÂ´s easy to fix.  And of course and additional fighter pilot might have been very nice. 

The Biplane has Luftwaffe markings (although sticker ones), which gives a very realistic look like a WWI plane.  

The fighter on the other hand resembles an early WWII Luftwaffe fighter, which if you like military models you will inmediately love.

Both planes are quite strong in their building and fill quite heavy. Since the piece count is not that high i didnt expect them to fill strong in their construction but they are quite sturdy.

IMHO the indy sets have some of the more realistic minifig scale models built, and this set is a testimony to that thought.

If you have enough money you might want to buy 2 of this sets and start your own Air Force (although vintage looking) for your town.

"lotographia","2009-07-23T04:50:12.28Z","Excellence superlative.","One obvious criticism of this set is that it contains exactly the same minifigs that are included in the early Motorcycle Chase set, whereas all the other recent Indy sets have an abundance of new minifigs. I don't think this is worth marking the set down for, though, since it means those who haven't been collecting Indy lego from the beginning can acquire some of the original characters.

I have to confess I never actually activated the 'wings fall off' feature of the fighter plane - I pushed quite hard and was afraid I was going to break one of the fragile canopy pieces. I don't think it's a very good design that makes you 'force' lego bricks like this, when there are plenty of alternatives. Also, the gunner in the biplane doesn't fit as well as he could into the gunner's seat.

These critisicms aside, I still think this set deserves five stars. The models are beautiful, much better than the simplified biplane that came with the Temple Escape set. The gimmick of the fighter plane doesn't interfere with its appearance in any way, the machinations are all neatly tucked away inside.

Just as there are some Star Wars lego sets that tempt me when I'm not a Star Wars fan, this set would definitely tempt me even if I weren't a fan of Indiana Jones. These aren't just toys, they're actually good quality models. Brilliant.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"auto_turrent","2009-08-17T14:50:46.107Z","it lacks in a few spots.....","i'm a sucker for any airplane set so when i saw pics of this i thought ""must get!"" ok,so on to pros and cons.



biplane pros:
cool look 
matches the plane in the movie
makes a nice small important  person plane
good recon type plane
good luggage compartment

fighter plane pros:
makes a good interceptor plane
almost as big as the dc-3 in peril in peru

cons:

$50.00 for 326 peices lego has gone mad!
landing gear is not the best
should be 40.00 or $35.00
fighter planes canopy is not enclosed


if its on sale,get it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"That_LDD_Guy","2010-01-08T11:07:02.577Z","Fun, unless you're looking for accuracy.","I cna imagine this would be a fun playset for a little kid, lots of playability, two big airplanes and of course, Indy. But, if you are an older collector, this set lacks in detail and looks, well, not very good from most angles. At 50 bucks, its a hit to the wallet, but it is a BIG set.
Anyway,
Pros:
Good playability
two big airplanes
great Modability
BIG
nice little things, like the cargo space in the Biplane.
Nazi stickers!

Cons:
Big price tag
3 minifigs! in a $50 set!
not the best looking airplanes.
The wing popping off thing is not very useful.

Once I have HEAVILY modded it, these thing are different:
New wings on both airplanes
Biplane got its turret and second seat kicked
Monoplane lost the wing shedding mechanism, gained a second seat, and got a torpedo stuck on the bottom
Biplane no longer has the cargo space
The Monoplane lost its flick-fires.

All in all a nice, if pricey, set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SR_71c","2010-01-09T20:40:12.81Z","Good set","This set is one of the best airplane lego has 
released. It's a bit pricey though.

              Pros: Realistic bi-plane
                      Lots of minifig acssesories 
                      Fall off wings

              Cons: Pricey
                       Fw-190 is incredibly inaccurate
                       Fw-190 has fixed landing gear
                      Fw-44 has a turret (the real thing didn't have any)

         Over all a great set and you should buy it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"clundsberg","2010-08-19T01:25:34.61Z","Nice set!","<p>This set as well as 7683 make me wish Lego would start making WWII airplane sets.&nbsp; Who wouldn't want a nice 10 mini figure set of a B-17?</p>
