"lotographia","2009-07-15T02:44:20.183Z","A few functional flaws...","So I build this set and call my girlfriend over to show her all the exciting features.

First I put Indy on the trapdoor and let it drop open. It doesn't drop open. The door isn't loose enough, it just drops a little and sticks there.

Then I shove Indy along the rails in the cart. He goes a couple of inches and stops. Turns out plastic axles aren't very good for wheels on railroad tracks.

Next I push Indy along to the first dip in the tracks. He bumps his head on the platform above him and gets stuck. I politely ask my girlfriend to stop laughing at how none of the gimmicks on this set seem to work properly - not for me, at least.

So that's why I can't give this set five stars. The action features needed perhaps a little more tweaking to get them working functionally. It's disappointing, but not the first time a Lego gimmick has failed to deliver.

But now onto the positive features, and why this set deserves at the very least a four.

Firstly, this set has three brand new minifigs, a new hair piece and costume for Willie and a new torso and head print for Indy. Indy's torso isn't actually new, it's just like the one in Cairo but with one sleeve ripped off, but I hadn't realised until I looked closely that Indy's face has a lopsided smile that doesn't feature in any other set.

Secondly, the new track system - admittedly you'd have to buy a lot of this set to be able to make a proper track, and it wouldn't have any straight bits, but the potential for this new track system is very exciting. Do I sense the possibility of a rollercoaster set in the near future? I really, really hope so.

This set is a must-have for any Indy Lego collector, just don't expect too much from the action features.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2009-07-20T14:50:49.047Z","The MINE of doom","<p><b>The Minifigures</b><br />
I&#39;d have to say the best feature of this set are the minifigs. You get Short-Round, Willie, Indy (&nbsp;who has a new face and clothes), two thuggies&nbsp;(one with makeup, the other one with a beard),&nbsp;and Mola Ram. Mola Ram is hands down the best minifigure, if only because of his cow skull headgear. All of the minifigs have printed backs except for Indy and Short- Round.<br />
<b>The Track </b><br />
Although the track&nbsp;only consists of six pieces, it&#39;s&nbsp;long enough&nbsp;to give the chase scene from the film a degree of credibility. The carts can fit three people if you position the minifigs correctly. The wooden plank that&#39;s supposed to hit the cart&nbsp;works, but just barely. The first real let down of the set is the first drop in the track.&nbsp;It&#39;s literally&nbsp;impossible for a cart full of&nbsp;minifigs to go down without the characters hitting their heads on the container above. However, this can be fixed by adding another brick layer to the pillars. The container above&nbsp;the track drops rocks through a trap door. The barrier at the end of the track collapses to give a crashing effect.<br />
<b>The Temple</b><br />
This set focuses much more on the track system than the actual temple. Several key aspects from the movie were left out, such as the giant statue of Kalii that lowers a cage into the lava pit below.&nbsp;Nevertheless, Lego did include the trapdoor that Mola Ram escapes through. This trap door, however, does not work. Your only hope of fixing it is to put a weight beneath it. And even then, its&nbsp;not foolproof. The Sankara stones can slide into and out of the skull. Not sure what the point of this is, but it gives the set a nice feature. The bottom&nbsp;of the temple has a crate of tools and diamonds, and a random falling sword trap which is completely useless. In all honesty, there are better, more movie accurate Indiana Jones sets than this one, so I would recommend buying this only if you collect the sets.</p>

(not much of a con but) on the first dip the minifigure heads may get stuck when they go down it in the mine carts. This can easily be fixed however.
the minecarts don't run well on the track.
it is hard to fit the 3 minifigures in the minecarts

"capnrex","2009-07-29T13:17:15.483Z","The Temple Of Doom","This is definitely a must-have set! It's amazing! There are loads of features to play with, and I certainly think it is worth the reasonably high price.

The minifigures are great, there are six of them, they are: Indiana Jones, this is an interesting minifigure as it has the same torso as in Ambush In Cairo but with one arm flesh coloured, as if he has lost a sleeve. Short Round, another good figure, although this was also in The Shanghai Chase set. Willie Scott in ceremonial robes which is new. A temple guard with a partially visible chest and a beard, this is good because it would be boring if you got two of the same thuggee guard minifigures. You then get another temple guard with red markings on his face and a fully covered chest. Last and absolutely certainly not least, in fact, last and best is more accurate. But seriously, this minifigure is amazing, there is so much detail with a new face, made for this character, a double sided torso and a fantastic hat!

The temple is simply immense, it has a trapdoor which leads down into the waiting carts below, a feature where the Sankara stones pop out of the skull statue and some good details like a bat and a skull. Below that you have a small section of track and some buffers with two small rooms flanking it.

The track is extremely fun to play with, it includes two carts, one for Indiana Jones and his buddies, and one for the Temple Guards to chase them in. First there is a shallow curve to the left, then a big curve to the right, following that the track dips and goes under a small building which drops rocks on anyone unfortunate enough to be below it. after that there is another curve to the left, finally there is another dip in the track. There you hit collapsing buffers with a lamp and a spider.

Overall, this set is certainly a fantastic buy. There is so much to do that you simply can't miss it!

"legofan266","2011-07-12T21:33:31.347Z","""Kali Ma!!""","<p><strong>Indiana Jones (Kali):</strong></p>
<p>This figure only appears in this set. This figure is exclusive, however his torso is also available in 7195. Just like in the movie though, one of his sleeves is ripped because of his fight with the thugees and Mola Ram which the torso in 7195, doesn't have a ripped sleeve.&nbsp;His head is available in 7196. so&nbsp;He is not a very rare minifig overall, but I would still all him exclusive. He does come with a pair of swords and a revolver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Willie Scott (Nightgown):</strong></p>
<p>Willie also comes in the set 7682, but with a completely different outfit. She has printed torso and legs and she is a pretty rare figure overall. She also has the double-sided face, just like all the other female Indiana Jones characters. She has her scared face on one side and her smiling face on the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Short Round: </strong></p>
<p>This figure is also available in the set 7682. The only difference is that he has a tourch handle in this set, which he dosn't have in the other set. He is a good figure to get, but I think they should of included a printed cap for this figure, like in the movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thugee: </strong></p>
<p>I've always wanted this figure because I've played the video games. I beleive that this is sort of the main type of thugee you can get. He has a very nice exclusive and colourful face, which is very neat. A rifle is also included with this figure. I also think they should of included more of these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thugee Slave Driver:</strong></p>
<p>This figure only ever appears in this set, kind of like the Thugee. He has a very nice muscle showing from his torso, which shows how strong he is, just like in the movie :P He also has a very nice face except when I got this set I relised he has the same face as bandit in set 7195. Apart from that I think he is an excellent figure. He also has a head dress, which is also included with the Thugee. This figure also comes with a massive sword.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mola Ram:</strong></p>
<p>He is kind of the star figure of this set. He only ever appears in this set and is probably the most rarest Indiana Jones figure you could get. He&nbsp;has a very nice printed torso with printed necklaces. He also has a very nice tan face :D&nbsp;He has a bit of red marking on top of his head (not too much) and he also has a very exclusive hat. It's tan coloured with printings on the front and back side. His hat also has a printed figures face on there which is very neat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Temple:</strong></p>
<p>The temple itself has lots of features, including a secret trap for Mola Ram to all into a cart. There is also a feature for pushing the famous 3 stones forward, for Indy to take. The carts are very well designed, just a bit hard to fit all the 3 figs in one cart. The carts got down the tracks really well, although they sometime need a little push ;P There are lots of animals and accessories in this set including bats and snakes and even spiders!! Lots of traps for the carts including the stones and also the sticks. There is also a feature were the piece swings forward when a mine crashes into it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Great set to get these wonderful figs, (especially Mola Ram) and in my opinnion this is great set for any Indiana Jones fan, this is a must have set. Lots of accessories in this set and in my opinnion it's worth it if you can still find it for $90USD or $100USD. Lots of cool and rare pieces are also included in this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>- Lots of cool parts, including the glow in the dark pieces and the rocks with lava printing and the flames</p>
<p>- Cool figures, especially Mola Ram</p>
<p>- Lots of features and traps</p>
<p>- Lots of accessories and weapons including the jewels and rifle and animals and many many more</p>
<p>- No stickers</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>- Not enough pieces for the price</p>
<p>- Indy doesn't come with his whip</p>
<p>- The carts always need a little push</p>
<p>- It's hard to fit all the 3 figs in one cart</p>
<p>- Some of the things are limited, they could of made the main part a little bigger instead of working so much on the tracks</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-12-17T06:35:31.777Z","This is a play set, but requires you to do the playing ","<p>Really this is the ultimate play set with multiple moving parts and train tracks. However, none of it functions as well as it should. Now let&rsquo;s review the whole set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>Wow! If you are buying a set to get cool parts then look no further. The train tracks alone would make the set great. But then add the space frame columns and it&rsquo;s even better. Of course you also have 2 trap doors, the half cylinders for the mine carts, a ton of skulls, spiders, webs, bats, snakes, a lot of fire, a large variety of swords and weapons, rocks and lava, and a large box with gems and tools. On top of that you get a ton of L shaped bricks and lots of browns. I&rsquo;ve never seen a more impressive selection of parts in a single set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>If the parts weren&rsquo;t enough, the minifigures are fantastic, all of them are highly detailed, much more detailed than Star Wars minifigures from this era. As a result you know exactly who they are and get some great unique headwear. See the pictures for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Build</b></p>

<p>The build is nothing too exciting, pretty much just standard stacking. It does take a while simply due to the size of the set, and while there aren&rsquo;t too many small bricks, there is a lot of detail so you really need to be paying attention the whole time. It isn&rsquo;t too repetitive (the bases of the temple are almost mirrored) but it is very similar structures being built through out. The play features are also very simple. Basically don&rsquo;t expect a challenge, the hardest part is preventing the track supports from falling apart, especially under the second structure.</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Model</b></p>

<p>the size of this model is impressive, obviously due to length of the tracks, but the temple itself is also quite large and tall. As a result you need a lot of space, but most of it is empty, so I don&rsquo;t think it would look too good on display. It is also fairly weak underneath the tracks, all the supports break off easily so moving it is a problem, and I imagine it could be very frustrating for younger kids. Fortunately, by the time that kids are old enough to watch the movies, I would think they would be old enough to recognize that they need to play more gentle with this set.&nbsp;It does however look pretty true to the movie, and to fill in the empty space would make the set too large, unaffordable, and hurt the playability which is the most important part, so...</p>

<p><b>Playability</b></p>

<p>This set is all about play. There are as many features to this set as there are must have parts. Unfortunately, none of them work too well which is a major flaw of the design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First you got the train tracks with two mine carts. The carts swivel which can be a fun way of dumping out characters, but the wheels on them are terrible. Way too much friction, even on the downhill portions of the track you need to push the carts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The carts are also a little too tight for three minifigures&nbsp;which is pretty problematic given that there are 3 good guys and 3 bad guys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first track feature is a small rock you hit that swings out wooden planks in front of the next cart, well the wooden planks don&rsquo;t spin far enough to cover the tracks on their own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next you get to the second structure that dumps coal into the carts. A real person would want to duck as they go under this structure, your minifigures&nbsp;will most likely forget to do so and may need some Tylenol afterwards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally you get to the barricades at the end of the tracks that tip over when you hit them. This is the one feature that works well for me, but the spider doesn&rsquo;t go flying like it shows in the back of the instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then you got the trap doors. Both are held up by a technic build that you pull out, but neither are heavy enough on their own to open all the way. There is one in the temple that dumps minifigures&nbsp;into the carts. The other is in the second structure and dumps the coal (which goes flying, careful you don&rsquo;t lose it). The temple isn&rsquo;t physically connected to the tracks so you need to place it appropriately. The second structure is connected to the tracks, but not very well, you&rsquo;ll be repairing this several times as you assemble the tracks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the top of the temple is a skull holding the stones, and the eyes and mouth where stones are held can slide out &nbsp;this is an entirely manual function so of course it works.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a falling sword beneath the temple and under the tracks. Quite honestly it is oddly placed and looks more like a booby trap from Raiders or Last Crusade. This is strictly manually operated, and at least gravity can do its job properly on this one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While all these features are amazing, because of how poorly most of them work, I can only give this set a 4 in playability. Had they worked properly it would deserve an 11.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>There are a lot of pros to this set. The parts and minifigures alone make it great. The endless amount of play that all the features give you is wonderful. However, the cons are that those awesome features just don&rsquo;t work. The build is also relatively boring for a set of this size. And the model is too fragile, large, and empty. I do recommend this set, but you should be aware of its shortcomings. This is the only set you&rsquo;ll ever need to represent this movie so that is a huge plus.</p>
