"Nightshroud99","2009-05-23T09:32:00.327Z","Good for Parts","This set really isn't that good. It has alot of technic pieces which I hate building with and the vehicles just aren't that good.

PROS:
Gold Pieces: Gold Hair, gun, dinosaur statue
Agent Swipe: New agent but really just a regular city face with added headset and raised eyebrows.
Gold Tooth: Cheap way to get him.
Wheels: I like getting wheels lol
New agents armor

CONS: 
Stickers
Alot of Technic Parts
No handlebars on Gold Tooths Bike
A little overpriced

Overall if you want a good starter set for Agents get last years Jetpack Pursuit, its much better. The set is worth getting if you don't have Gold Tooth, but I'm still thinking about picking up Gold Hunt just because its cool.

I felt the vehichles were pretty good for the money. Gold Tooth's quad bike is awesome, while I am pleased, but not as much, with Agent Swipe's 3-wheeler. In actuality, the 3-wheeler is unimpressive, and its highlight is its cannons, which are way too flimsy and aren't in a fixed position. The bike is actually better, however, than the development images of the set found on Boris's Bricks and/or Brickshelf.

"Alemas","2010-03-04T14:45:39.2Z","""Haha, now I'll escape- Hang on, where are the handlebars?!?""- Gold Tooth escaping","<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This set was launched in Summer 2009, when the Agents 2.0 theme was launched. It was actually called &quot;Agents&quot;, but for its second wave LEGO renamed it &quot;Agents 2.0&quot;.</p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Flick-fire missiles</li>
    <li>Ummm... that's it, I'm afraid... playability will suffer as a result...</li>
</ul>
<h4>Building Experience</h4>
<p>Woah, WHAT building experience? This set has only two small vehicles, so build time was... I think 5 minutes. Too quick. 3/5</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Woah... A gold pistol, a gold dinosaur, gold hair, tan hair, a motorcycle body, and a new PRINTED Agents body armour! 5/5</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>Ouch. Well, we have flick-missiles, but they barely work. Also, the Agent doesn't have any hand weapon, so the missiles are his only weapons! If those fail, bye bye Gold Tooth. Also, Tooth's bike doesn't have handlebars because the body is built on Technic pieces. Pretty poor. 3/5</p>
<h4>Value for Money</h4>
<p>&pound;8.79 for this? Not exceptional. 4/5</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>Not so good. The parts make up for this though, but playability isn't good, and the two vehicles are, frankly, cheap-looking. Not recommended. 4/5</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,4
"hobby_boy","2009-09-23T15:50:40.357Z","2.0 mission 1","I got this set as a birthday present from my friend in late August.

Pros:
- New agent
- New body armer
- the car can come off the wheels to make a hovercraft
- nice dino
- good dr inferno bike

Cons:
- Missiles don't work well

Apart from that its quite a good set. You should get it!

On the other hand, Gold Tooth has a cool motorcycle. Nice pieces. Just a hard build. At least the bike stays together well.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legoDad42","2009-12-31T15:16:39.34Z","Good Vehicle Starter Set!","Just a perfect, small Lego vehicle starter for your 6 yr. old on up. Easy to assemble and lot's of fun to play. 

Pro's - 2 very cool mini-figures of Agent Swipe w/armor and the James Bond-esque Gold Tooth w/gold hair and gold gun. The 3 wheel trike has a nice cool look to it with the back suspension single wheel higher then the front two wheels. Also comes with 2 flick firing missiles. Gold Tooth's motor cylce has a very interesting chassis with a spot to hold a gold dinosaur statue/artifact (included). Both vehicles roll very well and don't tip over easily. 

Con's - No hand gun/weapon for Agent Swipe and for some reason, Lego didn't design Gold Tooth's bike with handle bars. Bike still looks good but no handle bars designed for it. Kinda' odd in my opinion. 

Good starter to get acclimated to the Agents line for the younger builder. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-17T17:10:13.67Z","Gold Tooth gets away with gold...","Gold Tooth escapes with a rare gold dinosaur piece! And the bike will in fact go perfectly straight if propped up right! Pros and Cons please? Don't forget the thank you!

Pros:
1. Bike uses a new type of design, different from the tiny motorcycles seen everywhere else. 
2. BIGGER WHEELS!
3. Two vehicles, not one, but two. This increases playability levels to fun! 

Cons:
1. Agents car has an awkward design in my opinion
2. The car randomly turns if pushed and let go! DRIVES ME NUTS! 

This is a small set, I give it a 4.5/5 for sure, second choice, a 5/5. Hope this review helps! If you can buy this one, I say get it, especially if you like to (like me) race your sets with other LEGO fans, or just want a good chase scene ...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"z","2010-03-05T19:38:51.857Z","8967 Gold Tooth's Getaway","<p>I received this set from my brother as a Christmas gift, and built it as soon as possible.&nbsp; It is an average set, having no amazing features, but not being horrible either.</p>
<p><b>Box:</b>&nbsp; Not too much to say here, though there is a small comic on the front, showing the story behind the set.</p>
<p><b>Instructions:&nbsp; </b>The instruction book is the same size as many $10-30 sets.&nbsp; The build is quite simple, (providing you know how to connect technic pieces.)&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Minifigs:</b>&nbsp; The minifigs included are the villian Gold Tooth, and a newer addition to the Agents, Swipe.&nbsp; Gold Tooth has been seen in two other sets, so he is not new to the scene.&nbsp; Swipe, on the other hand, makes his debut in this set, and is&nbsp;a nice change from Chase.&nbsp; The accessories included are a golden gun, all-new body armor, two haircuts of the same type; one beige, one gold.&nbsp; Gold Tooth was new to me, so I was greatly pleased with both figs.&nbsp; I do wish that a gun was included for Swipe.</p>
<p><b>The Bike/Trike:&nbsp; </b>Gold Tooth's bike is surely the weaker part of the set.&nbsp; As many have said before me, the bike has no handles.&nbsp; I do not incredibly mind this, though many do.&nbsp; His bike is mainly made up of&nbsp; technic parts.&nbsp; It works fairly well, giving the bike some sense of suspension.&nbsp; On the back of the bike is probably one of the greatest prizes:&nbsp; A golden baby T-Rex!&nbsp; Of course the T-Rex is not &quot;alive,&quot; being a &quot;statue.&quot;&nbsp; This will definitely come in useful in the future.&nbsp; Swipe's trike is a nice design.&nbsp; Being slightly slanted forward, I have found that it looks more realistic to lean the fig back slightly.&nbsp; Armed with flick-fire missles, it seems fairly well-armed.&nbsp; I am not a fan of flick-fire missles; I feel that they are often over used, and should be replaced often with gun pieces that do not &quot;fire.&quot;&nbsp; I say 'often,' because there are certain sets&nbsp;that they work well with, (5982 Smash 'n' Grab.)&nbsp; A couple down sides&nbsp;are the fact that there are stickers.&nbsp; Certain sets I have chosen to apply them, but most I do not because it is very tedious.&nbsp; The other is that there is a low piece count.&nbsp; Under 70 pieces!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I would say buy it if you are into the theme, or have $10.00 with no future sets in mind.&nbsp; Also this is a good set if you receive it as a gift, like I did.&nbsp; If you do have other larger sets in mind and are wondering if you should take the money out of that goal, don't.&nbsp; Buy the larger set.&nbsp;</p>

"buzzandwoody2000","2010-03-24T19:15:40.403Z","WARNING DOWNTOWN, GOLD TOOTH IS COMING THROUGH! WAIT, I GOT HIM!","<p>This is a good set, and I don't have much to say about it. I like Swipe, and he is pretty rare because he only comes in this set. You can find Gold Tooth in the Mobile Command Center,&nbsp;and Gold Hunt. The Agents Trike is cool, and so is the Inferno bike.</p>
<p>PROS:</p>
<p>TRIKE:</p>
<p>Cool design</p>
<p>Has handlebars</p>
<p>Can fit two people on it if you take the peice on the back off (I did)</p>

<p>CONS:</p>
<p>TRIKE:<br/>None.</p>
<p>MOTERBIKE:</p>
<p>Has no handlebars, so the driver could spin out of control</p>
<p>It is stupid where the gun is because if he is in frount of the Agent, he can't shoot him, and the only thing good with it is to blast things and people out of the way.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T22:52:51.52Z","Do you expect me to talk, Goldtooth?","<p>Set #8967 Gold Tooth's Getaway: At first the Agents Theme was something that I was trying to avoid because I really wasn't sure I wanted to get into it, I already had so many others to collect that I didn't feel very good about adding another one. And this set would definitely seem to drive some people away from the theme if it was their first outing, but not me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few things to note right off the bat about this set, it is small, but it is still 10$ if memory serves, possibly 12.99$ I can't recall since I bought it on sale early this year back in January. The vehicles are built primarily using Technic pieces for the chassis, so they are really different from what you'd expect these vehicles to look like in ordinary LEGO form. Also the Agent Mini-Figure doesn't include any weapons to battle against Goldtooth with, aside from the flick fire missiles. He does however come with an interesting looking body armor accessory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You start by building the Tri-Wheeled Agent vehicle, as I said before it uses Technic pieces mostly for the chassis, and there are of course the flick fire missiles, the vehicle looks a little strange, but it is interesting and different from regular vehicles in the City Theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goldtooth's motorcycle looks oversized due to the Technic pieces being used to build it, I'm not sure how practical it would be in a real world setting, but in the partial fantasy/action adventure theme that is Agents it really fits right in. The Mini-Figure Goldtooth is a rather fun little figure too, and he comes with a weapon plus the Baby T-Rex piece turned golden statue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this set isn't all that bad, it can be a little strange when put next to other sets due to the use of Technic pieces in the vehicles construction, but I find that this only enhances the basic feel of the Agents Theme. If you're looking to test the waters of the Agents theme you might want to try one of the more expensive sets first though, because even though it is a cheap and interesting set, it can take a little getting used to upon first witnessing the final product in person.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

"Trueblox","2018-08-05T15:09:03.373Z","A nice starter Agents set!","<p>Hello, I am Trueblox, and i like playing with Lego. My review for today will be on Lego Agents 2.0 set 8967: Gold Tooth&#39;s Getaway.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The builds look fantastic for a small set, i like Gold Tooth&#39;s motorcycle and Agent swipes little buggy (at least that&#39;s what i think it is lol)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lets take a look at the minifigures:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Agent Swipe: I think he looks very good, i like how he and his little buggy came out. He is also a new Agent, appearing only in this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gold Tooth: I like his design very much, i like how his gun and hair looks like its made out of gold. He has appeared in the first wave (sets 8630 and 8635) So he is not a new villain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, lets take a look at the set and its play features!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Buggy: The buggy looks good, it has 2 flick-fire missles to take out Gold Tooth&#39;s motorcycle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Motorcycle: The best looking motorcycle i have ever seen! although it doesn&#39;t come with any play features, it looks very good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My overall opinion on this set:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My opinion in this set is that its very good, it was my first Lego Agents set and i had lots of fun with it! i say if you wanna boost your agents collection, get this set quickly!</p>
