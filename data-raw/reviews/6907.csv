"Nightshroud99","2009-05-23T09:38:35.513Z","Alot of Fun","This set is great! Two brand new minifigures plus Agent Fuse with his hairpiece. This set is just a great set to get just for the minifigures. Now on to the pros and cons.

PROS:
Dynamite: The female villain, new body, face and hairpiece.
Lego dynamite piece
Dollar Bill: Male villain. Has green count dooku hair and an awesome face and body.
Agent Fuse
Boat has spinning fan when you roll it
Safe: Very detailed with three $100 dollar bills
Cool green time bombs
Golden Gun

CONS:
Agent Fuses' boat is lame
Set is small
Price is fair for pieces but not great
Stickers

This is a great set for minifigures and a few rare pieces such as the money and golden gun. I recommend picking this set up. Also check out my YouTube channel I make LEGO video reviews. http://www.youtube.com/user/Nightshroud99",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2009-05-25T23:18:05.42Z","Good, but lacking something","This set is decent, but not matching the calibre of last year. I feel like the set is good, but not great. I like the minifigs, safe, river boat, and body armour, but the jet-ski is just lazy.

Pros:
Dollar Bill has diamond monocle
Fuse's body armour
when river boat is moved along a flat, hard surface, propeller moves
depth charges
dynamite piece

Cons:
jet-ski is too small
Dyna-mite figure is kind of plain
river boat is kind of small
price seems 3-5 dollars to high

the green hair peice
the money tiles
the red irina spalko hair
the bullet proof vest

i think fuses boat thing couldv'e been bigger but i ain't complaining.
i wonder why there wasn't a seat for dollar bill to sit on or maybe another dynamite bundle but i don't care it's a good set and i hope dollar bill gets away with his sfae of $300 dollars   LOL

"legoreviewer","2009-07-06T19:03:39.31Z","Great Set For A Minifig Collector","This set is ok. But the only reason I got it was because of the minifigs. I really like those figs. But anyways on to the review.

Minifigs: Really cool minifigs including: Agent Fuse w/ body armor.
             Dollar Bill w/ gold gun just like Gold tooth's.
            Dyna-Mite w/ dynamite piece.
A great minifig addition to an Agents collection.

Agent's Jetski: Just an afterthought. Nothing special. It's something we have all seen in any set with a boat.

Inferno Super Airboat: Odd name, but a nice design. The fan moves when you roll the boat on the ground. It works best on carpet though. Not hard floor.
Alot smaller than it looks but still fun. 

All in all this set is great for a minifig collector like myself. Or if you collect Agents sets.

"Crazybrick45","2010-08-17T15:42:10.18Z","One of the best LEGO watercraft! ","I got this for $20 at Walmart. On the box, the speedboat might look a bit small, though once you have it assembled you can see it's a fair size. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifigures and Accessories</span> <br><br>This set has 3 minifigures: Dollar Bill, Dyna-Mite, and Agent Chase(?). Both Dollar Bill and Dyna-Mite are printed on both sides. Dollar Bill, in my opinion, is the best fig in this set. He has the awesome green hairpiece which you can use to make a MOC The Joker. His face is just like the one of the henchman's in the Gold Hunt set, except it has some scratches and he wears a diamond monocle on his left eye. On his back is a printed $ sign, and he comes with the golden pistol from ""Gold Hunt."" Dyna-Mite sports the red Irina Spalko wig and dashing shades. She is also double printed with the Dr. Infero logo on the back. She comes w/ a pack of dynamite. And lastly but not least we have Agent Chase. It's the exact same one from 8630 Gold Hunt but with an orange headpiece and a new vest! The vest is really cool; there is a notch on the back where I suppose you could build some type of jetpack. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Hovercraft</span><br><br>As the title says, I would place this as one of the best LEGO hovercraft released. The feature is so neat: when you push the boat, the blades spin, and if you spin the blades, then it pushes the boat. The motor part is a bit difficult to build since there are quite a few technic pieces. But it really is such a neat feature! Blue circular tiles are placed along the bottom so when you're pushing it it looks like it's gliding. There are stickers for each of the blades and on the 2 gray tiles below them. It's a bit tedious to put them on. There are 2 green ""bombs"" that you can push off the side into the water. There are stickers on both of them, showing some buttons and a lever and a clock that says 30 seconds. I like to pretend these bombs release toxic gas into the water. The control area for the boat is pretty neat too: a steering wheel in the middle, below a speed gauge, and a lever on the left side. There is also a piece on the right side to hold Dyna's dynamite or Dollar Bill's gun. There is also a safe which contains 2 dollar bills, but it can hold more. There is a sticker on the top of the door.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Speeder<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br><br>T</span></span></span></span></span>here's not really much to say about this except that there are 2 red flick fire missiles.

"legoDad42","2010-01-28T17:50:09.45Z","Pleasantly Surprised!","This is a surprising fun small kit.  Upon first looks at photos it doesn't seem like much (of note it's very hard to properly photograph a lego model anyways). But once built, this is an extrememly playable model for your kid as well as a couple of nifty mini-figs!

PRO's - The Airboat itself is a nifty model with workable rotor/fan in the rear. This is operated by rolling the craft accross a floor with little rubber wheels underneath and connected by a couple of technique gears to make the fan spin extremely well. Very well done.

Airboat contains 2 depth charges, helm with steering wheel and a clip to attach a weapon/tool/etc., a safe with opening door and 2 tiles of money (safe detaches from Airboat), small Agents speed boat with 2 flick-fire missiles. 

The mini-figs are excellent...DOLLAR BILL has a great 'Joker like' green wig, face print has a diamond monocle, torso  print has Dr. Inferno crest on front, dollar sign on back and dollar bills coming out of his front jacket pocket, plus he comes with a gold pistol ala' Man with the Golden Gun. DYNA-MITE - has fantastic bold red wig, cool looking sunglasses print on face, torso ala' a leather jump suit with lightning bolt design, zipper and Dr. Inferno crest plus she come with a nifty 3 stick of dynamite. AGENT FUSE - is your standard Agent operative with body armor.

CON's - Perhaps too many stickers for some (didn't bother me) plus I hate it when certain characters don't get weapons. Agent Fuse doesn't come with a pistol.

Overall for sure playability, pick this up for your kid. Easy build, just help them with the technique fan part and they'll have loads of fun. I recommend this for the villian mini-figs. Very well done.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-17T08:23:20.217Z","Little Speedboat saves the day...or blows up...","First, I just want to say: haha! Look how cute Agent Fuse's speedboat is!

Ok, that's done, now about the set. I like it alot, especially for the fact that it's the second smallest (and second coolest) Agents 2.0 set. The design of the boat is superb, with a moving propeller when pushed on the floor (Hidden wheels on the bottom), an awesome orange for Dr. Inferno, two vilians, and a little speedboat so that at least Fuse doesn't have to swim. Shall we do some pros and cons?

Pros:
1. Two, not one, two boats to build!
2. Your imagination will run wild with this set, especially for the fact that the boat can fit a safe and up to three minifigures.
3. $20 USD, good price for those who are looking for a small but good LEGO Agents set.

Cons:
1. Propeller will fall off the back of the boat...so this will have to be put back on if you aren't gentle with it.
2. Though there is alot to do with this set, I recommend that one buys this with another Agents/City set, so that it balances it out and play is not limited (This is just my opinion)

Parents, note: Your child will have an easy time building this if under 10 EXCEPT for the wheels and propeller (Many Technic parts are included for the back, including some gears that must be placed perfectly.

I do recommend this set but...well, see the top...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-08-17T01:48:21.823Z","Agents 2.0 River Heist Review","<div class=""description""><p>This is the only set within the Agents 2.0 series/theme that I've picked up and is an example of when a particular theme comes out, I might only pick up one set.</p><p>It's a fun design and concept of Dollar Bill escaping on a ""swamp boat"" down a river. Making me think this could be taking place in some Florida Everglade with an Agent hot on his heels to recover the stolen safe.</p><h4>Instructions</h4></div><p>The instructions are in booklet format following LEGO's easy to follow step-by-step illustrations.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 203 pieces in this set. Of which, for some reason when I picked up this set, I had all of the printed money pieces gone and a couple other pieces missing. Luckily LEGO's help line proves to be great as they were willing to replace missing pieces from the set that slipped past quality control.</p><p>Love them or hate them, there are also stickers in this set.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get three minifigures in this set. The villain Dollar Bill whose hair pieces immediately has me thinking of Joker, his henchmen... woman rather with red hair and then the Agent himself sporting some body armor, red-orange hair. All three look very good and are well detailed.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The set is built in three stages.</p><p>1st - The Orange River Boat - This boat is clearly based on an Everglade type boat with the big fan behind it to push it forward through a swamp. The design of the set features some clever builds with technic pieces so that when you roll it across a floor or flat surface, the propeller fan turns. There are two bombs on either side that can be dropped off to stop the pursuing Agent on his jet ski boat.</p><p>2nd - Agent's Jet Ski Boat - While small, this little build is well detailed. The only part I don't care for are the flick weapons on either side. But being as I'm not a little kid, I'm probably not entertained by a toy that does something and would rather a toy I could use more imagination with.</p><p>3rd - Safe - While small, I love the design of this safe with the print on it for the electronic lock and the door to it. It's just great.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I am getting a little tired of seeing these flick weapons. Though the 
design on the villain's boat with the propeller that spins when you move
 across the floor is great. There's enough going on here though with the concept and design that this set is a lot of fun to play with.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Mask_of_Control","2020-05-11T23:57:16.187Z","A set that exceeded my expectations!","<p>When I was a kid I loved these theme but unfortunately, I never had an opportunity to buy one.</p>

<p>So at the end of 2019, I bought this set from a high-quality Portuguese store in BRIBCKLINK&nbsp;to complete my childhood dream and to see if this set was really good and not just nostalgia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I expected the set had one the best designs and playability that I have seen in a modern LEGO set.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>&raquo; Incredible design.</p>

<p>&raquo; Good variety of accessories.</p>

<p>&raquo; Good detail.</p>

<p>&raquo; Very good addition to a 2000s collector as this set makes part of the end of an era.</p>

<p>&raquo; Includes a lot of different play features&nbsp;at a low price.</p>

<p>&raquo; The play value is wonderful even with only this set.</p>

<p>&raquo; The minifigures have all good design and detail especially compared with other sets from that time.</p>

<p>&raquo; The set includes two vehicles.</p>

<p>&raquo; At last but not least, the Inferno&#39;s Super Airboat rotors move when the set is pushed in the ground.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p>&raquo; The stickers on the rotors have a tendency to pill off.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>This set showed me that these sets and theme were good and it was not just nostalgia. The play features and design were impressive for the size and price of the set and exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p>I will definitely get more sets from this theme in the future.</p>
