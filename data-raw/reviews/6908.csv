Agents 4-wheeled vehicle either chases or is chased by evil helicopter.  As it is, the 4-wheeler has somewhat similar weaponry, with flip up missiles and rockets?/lasers? on the side.  A fairly useless computer and gun rack is hidden under the hood.  The suspension and large tires are great, however, as is the overall design of the vehicle.  Rolls extremely well, even over rough terrain, er, piles of Legos.

The helicopter is quite nice, even though the bubble cockpit doesn't actually cover the pilot.  Slimeface (I believe his name is) is a very nice figure.  Transparent green head, unique body, and white and green rubbery hairpiece.  

The crash-through barricade is a throw-in just to help bump the price a bit.  I guess it adds a modicum of playability.

Anyway, a very nice set.  Not perfect, but a solid 4.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Nightshroud99","2009-05-22T19:25:47.717Z","Awesome 4 Wheeler!","Sweet! Thats what I thought when I saw the box art for this set. The set looked to have so many possiblilities, especially with a new minifigure. Upon seeing the 4 wheeler it brought to my mind the Halo Warthog and Jeeps from Jurasic Park. And I can say the set doesn't disapoint. I'll use the pros and cons system to review this set.

PROS:
Great Suspension! It utilises technic pieces including a rubber technic piece for felxibility. This really gives it the feel of a monster truck : ))

Detail: The detail on this set is very good. The front headlights are imposing and cool.

Big Rubber Wheels

New red Fez headpiece: The red hat that is used in the new Indiana Jones River Chase set is utilised twice in this set. They are the back of the side missiles/guns. 

Hidden front compartment: It holds two guns and has a nice computer scrren sticker.

Flick Fire Missiles: Eh I don't like these but they have the same trans red piece that was used in the Republic Attack Shuttles Missiles

Dr. D Zaster! Awesome minifigure for me at least. He has the smae face and body as slimeface... But with a repainted Dr. Inferno hairpiece.

New Agents armor piece

CONS:

Another Agent Chase....

Stickers

Helicopter is just ok

The set is basically a different version of last years Turbocar Chase. Turbocar=4 Wheeler Mini Helicopter=SpyClops awesome helicopter little gate=big gate with sound piece etc...
Overall I love this set and highly recommend it. I paid $35 for it at ToysRus but its now available from LEGO. shop for $30. Also check out my YouTube channel for great lego reviews! http://www.youtube.com/user/Nightshroud99",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"nrbenz","2009-06-04T00:45:09.03Z","Awesome Agent 4 Wheeler With the buy","I gave this set a 5 because I believe it was worth it.  I was not real sure at first when I got it and started the build especially starting with the copter.  I love Sinnester in green he really looks cool but I wish they had more agents.  Like the Indiana Jones I get pretty tired of the same mini figs.  But back to the build....  As I started the 4 wheeler I was very impressed at how solid they made it.  Many times my 7 year old will be frustrated with sets because they fall apart easy during play sometimes leaving no playability with out constant rebuild.  But this 4 wheeler was SUPER impressive.  I have played with it rather rough and so have both my boys.  I was so impressed I decided to make a Evil one as well in orange and black (because why do we need so many evil flying vehicals?) .  It turned out awesome and I put the big 4 wheeling mud tires on it too. 

Pros:
  The evil Minifig
  Agents armor
  THE TRUCK  its just plan fun to drive around.  
  Did I mention the suspension on the truck...it just moves very freely making it fun to drive around and over stuff

Cons
  SAME AGENTS
  Stickers  not as bad as some of the agents 
  another weak evil vehical to me.

I paid $35 to get it first at TRU ...but when it goes on sale I will probably pick up another just to get another truck and modify it.

"Marcus_Clinton","2009-05-25T15:10:08.89Z","Great Set!","I love this set for many reasons, the 4 wheeler car is awesome and the suspension definitely makes it easy for it to go ""off road"". The figures are ok D-Zaster is just slimeface's head with a different outfit and crazy hair. The hair is inferno's except with white and lime green however the lime green peels off with any form of light play >:(.The minigate is pathetic and isn't very good for anything except for an excuse to mark up the price and piece count. D-Zaster's helicopter is great but kinda puny and overrun by stickers. The cockpit is a major disappointment because it doesn't cover up D-Zaster. My cousin who also owns the set pointed out that chase could easily just shoot him because he's not even protected by anything, I said that there wasn't any point because if he got too high the air pressure would just kill him anyway :P. I was very pleased to find 2 fez hat pieces because I'm not a major fan of indy. onto the TL:DR Pros & Cons

Pros:
.Cool suspension 
.2 Fez hats
.Great Minifigs 
.Cool vehicles 
.nice pieces 

Cons:
.the lime green on D Zaster's hair piece peels easily
.the mini gate
.LOTS of stickers
.Cockpit

Even though it seems that there are lots of cons I think this is still a great set and it is worth buying. Many of the things that I don't like (stickers D:) are things that other people won't have any problems with. So all in all this set was pretty good and it is a worthy addition to the agents 2009 line.

"Greyface","2009-06-12T16:07:31.217Z","8969-1: 4-Wheeling Pursuit","This is a pretty good set, which is normally $30, but which I had to buy for $35 (silly TRU...) It includes a new Dr. D Zaster (Slime Face promoted???) and his helicopter, complete with slime barrels, which (as seen in the comic) he is dropping on the Agents City citizens. For this reason, this set is good if you have Robo Attack, as the citizens from Robo Attack are the ones in the comic. The helicopter is small, but good for its size. Also, it has a seat, which is a major improvement for Agents helicopters. The only dissapointment is the dome/windshield, which is rather small and awkward.

The set also includes Agent Chase, with the amazing new bulletproof vests, and a large ATV/monster truck. The truck itself is cool with Bad-guy trailer truck-style ""acrobatic legs"", though this makes the truck rather wobbly when driving. The truck includes some ingenious pieces, along with two more Agents pistols: I always seem to be running out.

In addition, there is a small road block in which the truck can crash through with some force. It is a great addition to the set, though it doesn't serve its purpose well and is rather flimsy in design.

This set is a 4.5/5; there are a few minor dissapointments, but nothing major. Dr. D Zaster and the truck take the highlights.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2009-12-04T20:17:00.607Z","Fan of Agents... just not the bad helicopters","Well, another good Agents vehicle. The truck is really good looking.  Kind of like a topless Hummer.  The wheels are huge, and the truck, like the earlier convertible car (Turbocar Chase 8634) , are way too big to fit in with other minifig scale vehicles, but they have so many great added features, it does not matter.

The hidden missiles in the back, and the hidden hand guns up front are great.  I think I would have liked to see an engine up front if they were going to all of the trouble of making an opening hood.   I would have liked to see actual seats as well.
The working suspension is a great feature.  It is basically the answer to the villain's 

The problem with this set is the helicopter.  I am a HUGE fan of the LEGO flying vehicles, big or little.  The Agents jet fighter is great, the Agents helicopter is an amazing flying base.  But the two helicopters (including 8634) are just not very good looking.  They are lumpy, and just do not look like they could stand up to the power of the Agents.  Besides, I am not sure why we keep getting helicopters with rotor protectors that have the rotors hanging off the side.
The front windshield is a good piece to have though.  Mine was so clean without any scratches.  It does work well for the small style helicopter.

I do not even care too much about the gate.  It does not matter to me too much if it works or not.  It is just a gimmick to help sell the set by making it exciting looking on the box cover.

If you are a fan of Agents, this is a needed set.  The truck is very well built.  Tough and good looking.   The helicopter is a little weak, but Dr. D Zaster is a good bad guy to get your hands on.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2009-07-01T14:47:46.717Z","OK","Yeah. It's just OK. It's not great. 

THE HELICOPTER:
The helicopter is kind of neat, but it feels really underdone. For one thing, Dr. D. Zaster/Slime Face has no protection whatsoever. The cockpit is simply half a bubble. If he goes too high, he could be killed by the air pressure; if he gets to close to Chase, he could be shot; and if he stands up too quickly, he could be decapitated by the rotor. Not the safest vehicle we've seen so far. Heck, I'd feel safer traveling on Saw Fist's snowmobile with the constant fear of getting pulled under the treads. 6/10

THE 4X4
The 4x4, on the other hand, is one of the most powerful vehicles that has yet come out of this line. The little computer under the hood is pretty neat, but it raises the obvious question of where the heck is the engine? Is this another one of the enchanted propulsion vehicles that requires the intervention of you, the Lego god, to move? Oh, well. That oversight is forgiven by the headlights, twin fez pieces, and amazing suspension. The suspension alone puts the truck up a notch, and the fezzes put it up another notch. 9/10

THE GATE:
The gate, unfortunately, is incredibly disappointing. It's really flimsy, somewhat useless, and only seems to serve one purpose, to make the set more expensive than it has to be. Honestly, they could have taken out the barricade but kept the piece count the same by adding to the helicopter. 3/10

FINAL VERDICT:
Let's see: 6/10 + 9/10 + 3/10 = 3/5 + 4.5/5 + 1.5/5 = 9/15 = 3/5

Unfortunately, the gate knocked this set down a whole point.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legoDad42","2010-03-12T18:14:34.623Z","Great 4 Wheelin' Truck!","The Agent's 4-Wheeling Pursuit is a highly playable set with a great truck (with neat features) and an excellent villian mini-fig, Dr. D. Zaster.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Pro's - The 4 Wheeler Truck is the star of the kit. Great looking design with high, tilting suspension on 4 large rubber tires. The tilting suspension is the neat feature here using technique and rubber pieces. Rolls well on any surface.&nbsp; Rides smooth, clean and the wheels tilt effectively and independently&nbsp;over any obstacle like a true 4-Wheeler. <br/>Some nice additional features are...Front hood opens up to reveal a computer terminal (w/readout and thumbprint graphics) and clips to hold 2 black pistols, left and right of mid-section are lasers/guns on tilting mount and the back hood opens up (using technique pieces to raise and tilt back)&nbsp;revealing a twin missile launcher (flick fire missiles w/round trans-red tips).&nbsp; Excellent weapon's feature!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Dr. D. Zaster's Helicopter is a simple but effective vehicle with 2 green canisters (left and right) that dispense toxic gases or can be detached to drop down as toxic bombs. Front cockpit canopy opens and closes. The helicopter is light on design but big on playability.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The two mini-figs...Agent Chase w/body armor is your standard Agent operative and&nbsp;Dr. D. Zaster has transparent green head (great look), white fright wig with green stripes, black jumpsuit (graphics front/back/legs) w/green ooze design around neck which seems to say it's oozing/leaking from Dr. D's head.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>This kit also comes with a gate (with center stop sign)&nbsp;that can snap apart when the 4-Wheeler barrels through it.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Con's - Even though Dr. D's helicopter is high on playability, it's design is lacking. Wish Lego gave a little more effort into the design aspect here considering how well they did with the 4-Wheeler (proably has to do with piece count and price point). Also, the stickers on the curved surfaces like the canisters and fuslage keep peeling off (suggest a pin-dot of Elmer's glue to hold in place).<br/>Dr. D. doesn't come with a hand held weapon (one of my pet peeves).<br/>Small quibble on the 4-Wheeler...under the hood with the computer terminal there's no engine (I've since mod'ed this) and when you open the hood all the way it rubs against the top part's of the front grill and causes separation so the hood can pop off&nbsp;from it's mount if done too often. Also the left and right gun/lasers fall off from time to time.<br/>The gate does'nt snap apart too well. It just topples over when hit with the truck. Suggestion...make sure both pedastels the gate's arm is attached too is mounted securely onto a large base plate to give it some weight. Then the snap apart action should work.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Overall, despite the 'con's' above...get this for the 4-Wheeler truck. It's a great vehicle with the best suspension I've seen on a Lego kit (excluding technique kits of course).<br/>It's a highly playable set for kid's and a wonderful addition for&nbsp;vehicle collector's, Agents compleatists and the Dr. D. Zaster mini-fig is&nbsp;a must have (oh, by the way he's missing a tooth...;)...)!",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
