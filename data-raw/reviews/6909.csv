"cassidyarch","2009-05-24T12:25:16.42Z","Retro Robot Attack!","This was my must-have set from the new Agents 2.0 line-up. It has a lot of style and humor. The robot looks awesome parked in Dr. Inferno's Volcano Base.

The new tall dome is fantastic. If you put a standing minifig on a flat surface, the dome is exactly tall enough to enclose it. It's a great new piece, and I'm excited to see what people do with it.

The other bonus to this set is the TERRIFIC civilian minifigs. These are, hands-down, the best civilians EVER. Especially the retro spaceman t-shirt. Pure fan service. LEGO could have easily cut these from the set, just stuck to the agents and robot, but the added civilians really make this set special.

The Agents line continues to win me over. Secret ""Best Theme of 08/09? Maybe.

"cephalopoid","2009-05-27T01:00:12Z","Giant Robots Rule!","First, as you might have noticed, the price per part on this set is a little on the high side, but there are many things about this set that makes up for the price.  

First, the minifigs are great, namely the tourists (I can see one being either Walter from ""Lebowski"" or Hunter S. Thompson).  The agents get yet another quad, which isn't much, and I was surprised by how swooshable the little plane is.  With some very simple mods the plane could be very cool.

The star here is the giant robot, however.  Yes, there are stickers, but the stickers are hilarious (this is one of the few sets I actually applied the stickers).  The details in the robot are great, everything from the dials in the cockpit to the little ""booster jets"" under the torso so that maybe the top can ""boost"" off the legs.  The robot is well built and super posible.  I might go and buy a couple more to have an all out robot fight!

Uppers:
* It's a giant robot.
* Great minifigs.
* It's a giant robot!
* Great articulation and details.
* Hover plane is swooshable!
* It's a freakin' GIANT ROBOT!

Downers
* Not as chunky as moc robots.
* Meh quad.

"SaintElsewhere","2009-07-21T20:09:00.483Z","You can't call yourself a super villain until you build a giant, kung-fu fighting robot.","   And now Doc Inferno's done it. And what a robot it is. Given the minifigure-human ratio, I'd estimate that the robot would stand almost 35 ft. tall in real life. Intimidating. And that's not even considering the armaments. The light-up brick in the laser is a good touch and the ""Toast Grill Flambe"" sticker is  adorable and hilarious. The claw, while a bit flimsy, gets the job done and can hold a minifig with ease. Then, if those fail, there  are TWO, count 'em, TWO escape crafts. The first is a bit obvious, being the top half of the robot itself. This separates from the bottom and has what I believe to be four thrusters on the bottom. The second craft is much smaller and more cleverly concealed. The platform upon which the good Doctor sits actually lifts right out of the robot, with two folding wings and a thruster on the bottom.
   Of course, the set is much more than just the robot itself. Also included are two Agents vehicles and three scared tourists. The vehicles are a bit small, but they get the job done, armed with flick-fire missiles and a grappling hook with a looooong cable. (The latter being a pain in the butt to wind and unwind.) And the tourists show that someone on the design team was really thinking. That's a good sign.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"captain_radda_radda","2009-06-23T20:25:46.903Z","Every bad-guy needs a giant robot ","This is the best Infernoe vehicle so far. The amount of new peices is awesome. The flame piece, the dome, and the vest are great additions to the Lego piece family. The jet is swooshable and pretty decently sized. The ATV is cool too, but the grappling hook is too long and is too hard to reel in. Infernoes escape jet is cool too and has a laser on the bottom. The flying torso is strange, but welcomed. The legs and lower body are blocky, but add to the classic look. 

Pros:
The detail on the robot
The Agents and their squad
The random civilians
The new pieces

Cons:
The ridiculously long grappling hook

Overall:
An awesome set and a great addition to Infernoes army. I recomend it for any Agents fan and even star wars fans looking for a bad guy vehicle. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Nightshroud99","2009-07-23T19:26:05.39Z","My Favorite Lego Agents Set!","This set is the best Agents set I own and I own Mission 1,2,4,5, gold tooth's getaway, river heist, and Four Wheeling Pursuit. Its just so cool! With six minifigures (3 of which brand new) plus two mini vehicles and a HUGE robot this set just has so much to offer. Now on to the pros and cons.

PROS:
Six Minifgures (Chase, Trace, Dr. Inferno and three brand new civilians)
The civilians are all very cool, LEGO did not slack off with them.
Mini ATV (looks cool)
Mini Jet
Robot which has a light up brick, several new pieces and is modular; as in its torso can come off easily for more play experience.
GREAT play experience!

CONS:
$50 or $60 at Toysrus is overpriced for 414 pieces (but I think its well worth it)
stickers (no big deal to me)
Mini ATV's grappling hook really doesn't work very well.

Overall I highly recommend this set to ANY and ALL fans of LEGO. It just has so much to offer and even if you don't get any other LEGO Agents sets I highly recommend getting this one! Also check out my YouTube channel; I do LEGO reviews. http://www.youtube.com/user/Nightshroud99",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoDad42","2009-12-30T13:45:13.137Z","Excellent Design!","Very cool new Robot from Lego. Excellent retro design. Seems very 1950's sci-fi with the feel of a James Bond-esque villian. Excellent for kids to build and play with (if child is around 4,5 or 6, help them with the build). And it's very poseable. Also there's so many extra's in this set with figures and vehicles. Just excellent. 

PRO's-Robot design, right hand rotating claw (which can hold the mini-figures in its grasp), left hand with a great idea from lego: a light up brick that attaches to the left arm to light up a 'flame thrower' type weapon (excellent idea). Villian sits in the bubble headed top of the robot, which can be opened and the villian can eject and escape via a small escape pod/craft. Torso of Robot can also be detached from legs and used as an escape vehicle. You also get a Lego Agents jump jet plane with 2 flick fire missiles, a 4 wheeler vehicle, 2 lego agents (Chase and Trace), 3 civilians (one with a camera) and the villianous Dr. Inferno (I think that's his name) with a rubber head-dress design and brush metal right arm/claw. The 4-wheeler has a rope (string is strong) attached to a wench on the back end with a hook. 

CON's-Really none except the 4-wheeler could be slightly better designed (perhaps a more detailed vehicle and could use a 'crank' or lever to help pull the rope/string-but you can do this with your thumb anyways). Also mid-torso area doesn't completely rotate 360 degrees. It goes all the way right and all the way left but to completely rotate 360 it touches/taps part of some bricks and makes them separate if done too hard. Lego should've just added a small center piece to lift torso slightly so it rotates smooth. 

Other than my above 'CON' suggestions, this is an excellent toy/model from Lego. I HIGHLY recommend it to new and old lego collectors and especially for young kids to play with. A Robot, 2 vehicles (4 if you count in the escape pods from the Robot) and 6 mini-figures. JUST A GREAT SET!

"polyester","2010-01-27T22:35:59.92Z","Best set of the year.","This is one of the greatest Lego sets I've ever seen.  Not only is it a giant flame-spewing robot (which would be good enough to rate a 5 on its own), but the attention to detail and all the extras would rate this a 7 or 8 if the scale went that high.  Best of all, the playability is through the roof, as is the shelf presence if you're a display sort of person.

First, the robot:  it's extremely poseable.  There are hinges and swivels everywhere, and you can get it into any position you can think of.  It separates into two sections, and there's another little jet-powered escape pod inside.  The flame lights up, and the orange-and-black color scheme is great.

About the only criticism I can think of is that the upper-arm segments are a little wimpy.  A few pieces to beef them up and this robot would be much better proportioned, but that's a minor nitpick.  Also there are lots of stickers, which used to be a major con for me but there's really no avoiding them anymore.

The Agent vehicles are not bad, but small and sort of an afterthought.  The jet is the weakest - it doesn't sit flat on the ground (it rocks backwards), and getting someone in or out is a pain in the butt.  She needs to lean back at just the right angle to get the canopy closed because there's so little space in there, and her gun just rattles around in the back.  Weak, but good for playability.  The mini ATV is simple but cool, and the grappling hook is a nice touch.  As mentioned in other reviews the rope is incredibly long, but easily fixed: I just cut it in half and it's still plenty long enough.

What really makes the set, though, is the terrified civilians.  This is the demented crowning jewel of this set.  You get a lady, a man (with an awesome spaceman shirt) and a picture-snapping tourist complete with shades, a tacky Hawaiian shirt and a camera.

Whoever designed this set needs to design more.  I love the attention to detail, and everything works well together.  A perfect 5/5 - it doesn't get any better than this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"metalgearsolid_MGS","2009-12-31T22:03:37.14Z","Great fun to play, go get it!","Summary: 
It's always a pleasant surprise when a set exceeds initial expectations and Robo Attack just blew me away with it's fun 'play' factor.  Go get the set if you can still find it cause you won't regret it. 

Playability: 10/10 
1 giant evil robot, 2 agents each with their own vehicles and 3 civilians - a kid could probably spend hours just playing with the evil rampaging robot.  Heck, even an adult like me couldn't resist playing after the set was built.  Both vehicles are great inclusions because they really add to the overall play factor. 

Really unexpected but kudos to the set designer for making this such a fun set. 

Design & Build: 8/10
It's a small set, so not much to build here. The robot was a great build though - the legs felt satisfyingly solid and the light brick in the arm was a nice touch (though a tad hard to activate while playing). The 2 vehicles are a bit too small though. 

The 6 minifigs are great, thoughtfully included with reversible happy/horror faces (except for Dr Inferno - guess he only has to look evil, but would have been good to have a horror face for when he is caught by the good guys). Loved the civilian torsos - no heavily used to bits torsos here.  The girl is a redhead - also rare. Guy in sunglasses gives off a nice holiday vibe complete with cheesy print shirt and camera.

Some nice pieces included such as chrome grills, the clear dome for the robot and light bricks.   Quality of Dr Inferno's rubber hair leaves much to be desired though. Really really poor quality printing on the hair.   

Price: 9/10 
For 6 (nice looking) minifigs, a great robot with loads of rare pieces and 2 small vehicles.

"DrFrankenstein","2014-11-02T19:58:55.947Z","Best agents set out there","<p>This robot is the perfect terror-inducing nightmare to put your LEGO town citizens on the run. Sporting a great vintage look and just the right size the mech compliments Dr Inferno&#39;s evil maniacal look splendidly. The color scheme is very cool with flamboyant orange accents and dark overtones. The frame of the robot is very poseable thanks to the large number of adjustable but plenty stiff joints. One can easily imagine using it in a scene with street house destruction, running terrified citizens and helpless cops. Speaking of citizens, this set features no fewer than three great terrified minifig tourists that add a lot to the atmosphere and playability of the set. The agents and and their vehicles are also nice, although less remarkable than the main villain that stands tall amongst the scene of chaos. Its ability to launch the egg-shaped upper body with the jolly flamethrower and claw into a terror flight as well as the ability of Dr Inferno to escape the pod through his mini-flyer make this a very fun toy. This set has the right mix of coolness and humor to satisfy every heroes and villains movie buff. If you want to pick up some agent sets, this is the set that should be at the top of your list.</p>
