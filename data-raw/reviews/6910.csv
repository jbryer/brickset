http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=29424

Overall the Helicopter has many moving parts that most pictures do not show.  Like multiple doors that open, a jet ski in the back, working rotating blades just to name a few.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jet94","2009-08-16T13:05:28.153Z","Best lego set","This is my favourite lego set. I bought the old Dino 2010 helicopter and thought it would be tough to beat, but this does. It's by far the best Agents set. And also the base isn't average, especcially if you have the volcano base as well but even if you don't it's still great. The helicopter is the main part of the set and the dual blades look great as well as working great as well, when you push the button forward they spin

Pros
Great Helicopter
Minifigs
Armor
Lots of weapons 
Magna droinds
HUGE satellite
Mini volcano base
Opening helicopter doors
Spinning blades
Cool Jet ski

Cons 
None

If you don't have this set i seriously recomend buying it

I cannot word it any better that that review, it is right on the money.<br><br>My 5 year old kids love playing with this thing, rappelling the minifigs down the cable, jumping the jet-ski out of the back all the while and spinning the rotor blades. <br><br>The build was interesting and varied and the level of detail in the cave as well as the helicopter is stunning. With a little patience my kids were able to put it together by themselves which made them really proud because the helicopter is so big and impressive. Even my wife kept commenting that it really is an exceptional cool set.<br><br>Pay a little attention when putting the rotor blades on because it is possible to mount the gears wrong so that the blades hit each other but that is easily fixed.<br><br>It really does not get much better than this set, which was a great surprise when I finally convinced myself to buy it.<br><br>If you can; get it. You will not regret it!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

set (8971) is a LEGO Agents set which came out in 2009. It comes with 7 minifigures and 733 pieces.
This set does include decals.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifigures:</span><br><br><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Agent Chase:</span> Agent Chase is a very basic LEGO Agents charackter. He comes with a double-sided head. On one side you can see the serious face and on the other side you can see his face with the blue sun-glasses. He has printed legs and black hair.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Agent Charge:</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></span>Agent Charge has the same Agents uniform as agent Chase. Charge comes with brown hair and a brown beard. The head is not double-sided which is a little bit disappointing. A big plus is his new armor.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Agent Swift:</span></span> Agent Swift has the same uniform as agent Chase &amp; agent Charge. She also got the same armor piece. Swift has the black hair piece of Irina Spalko from the LEGO Indiana Jones theme and the same head as agent Trace. Her face is double-printed. One side shows you her happy face and the other side shows you her scared face.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Magma Commander:</span></span> The Magma Commander has a silver and orange armor which is double-sided. He comes with the same helmet as Break Jaw. The head is transparent orange and he looks like a robot because he has a computer as eyes. His right arm is the same metal arm as the ones from the henchmen of the 2008 LEGO Agents line.</li><li><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Magma Drone:</span></span> You also get 3 magma drones in this set. They have the same torso and legs as the Magma Commander. The only difference is that they have a gun on their right arm instead of a claw. The heads are made out of joy-sticks. These figures and the Magma Commander would also make good characters for Star Wars stopmotion.<br></li></ul><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Basement:</span><br><br>The basement comes with a radar which turns full 360Â°. There is also a computer (which has a sticker) which turns. The door does open with help of a lever. And there's also a camera next to the door. In the inside of the mountain base you can see a laboratory where the magma drones get build.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Helicopter:</span><br><br>The helicopter is very awsome. The blades will spin if you push a lever which is connected to rubber bands. The blades on the back will also spin. The cockpit opens easily and you can see some printed controls and the two chairs where the minifigures can sit. The turrets on each side do swivel. Also the headlights are very cool but also small. The doors on each side can be opened and you can have a look at the inside. On two doors you can see a seat and a computer where you can put the third minifigure. There's also a string on each side. The strings hold a backpack with a light and a pistol and they can be halued by turning the big wheels.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Positive:</span><br><br><ul><li>Minifigures</li><li>Mechanism for the big blades<br></li><li>The bad guys would be good Star Wars characters<br></li><li>Basement</li></ul><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Negative:</span><br><br><ul><li>Stickers</li><li>Another agent Chase</li><li>String could be difficult to put on for some people</li><li>No double-sided head for agent charge.<br></li></ul>All in all it's a great set to get and I would highly recommend you to
get this model. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Videos I made of this set:</span><br><br>Review: http://www.youtube.com/user/KLOKRIECHER#p/search/0/Cqp-6hCsK_M<br>Stopmotion: http://www.youtube.com/user/KLOKRIECHER#p/search/1/50A0fI6mnDE<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"legoDad42","2010-03-17T00:36:04.437Z","Best LEGO helicopter ever!","<h4>The Aerial Defense Unit has far and away the best LEGO helicopter ever. Great build and huge on playability, this is a must buy. A very sturdy model so it'll hold up to kid play and AFoL's will love it for the design, build,&nbsp;details&nbsp;and great villian mini-figs.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PRO's</strong> - Twin rotating blades. Best feature on the kit and best working piece on a LEGO&nbsp;model &nbsp;in awhile. On the tail you have a lever you push forward against a rubber band that then pushes technique gears to spin the blades. The blades spin at the same speed but alternately so they don't touch. You keep pumping the lever forward and the helicopter's blades spin fast and looks great doing it! Talk about <em>swoosh-a-bility...</em>with the tail built upon a strong technique skeleton and the blades spinning madly, you'll be flying and swooshin' your ship all over the house without fear of pieces falling off. Well built and extremely sturdy model for play.</p>
<ul>
<li>2-seat cockpit with large, great looking canopy. Printed tile control panel.</li>
<li>Left and right of cockpit has twin machine guns/cannons.</li>
<li>Under each rotor blade are 4 missiles/lasers.</li>
<li>4 Large cabin doors which open wide to access interior. Back doors on each side have a computer terminal mounted into the swing arm.</li>
<li>Front part of cabin has 2 zip line mounted(tied) to a backpack with clips for guns, binoculars, walky-talky, flashlight, etc. </li>
<li>Backpacks attached to Agents armor to repel/ascend from the craft. At times the weight of the mini-fig and backpack attached to the zip-line will pull down the Agent, repeling him into action.</li>
<li>Locks(outside left and right) for zip lines.</li>
<li>Mid-section column in cabin also has clips for aforementioned tools, equipment, etc.</li>
<li>Back section cabin has area for a simple but effective jet-ski (holds in place with a simple lock in rear of cabin).</li>
<li>Agents Chase and Swift mini-figs with duel faces (Agent Charge single faced) and all have body armor.</li>
<li>Great looking Magma Commander (with trans orange head, silver helmet, silver right arm) and 3 Magma-Drones (with silver right arms).</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set also comes with a small/mini-Volcano base lair. Front door (with a nice looking mouth opening with teeth design) opens up and down with simple techniqe lever. Outside left of door is a laser rifle/cannon, left above has a platform with a computer terminal (w/silohette's of Agents helicopter and this base/lair), right above door is a large radar dish which swivels 360degrees (using a technique gear). Interior right has a simple screen/terminal with a countdown-like clock and left is a tilted small mount/platform which you fit in one of the Magma-Drones simulating either a repair bay or a duplication chamber (crankin' out Magma-Drones for the Commander's army).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CON's </strong>- None. Some say the little Volcano lair is cheap or silly to add in without more details but it's meant to be a forward radar station for the larger Volcano base (from Agent's first series). I suggest mod'ing this lair as I have(I've added more large stone wall pieces, foliage, detailed interior with computer terminals, added a swiveled throne for the Magma Commander, etc.)</p>
<p>Also for some, a good amount of stickers is a negative and in this case I agree. The helicopter looks better without the Agent's stickers but you gotta' use the computer terminal ones to complete the look for those areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting this set. Again, as I've said...this is far and away the best LEGO helicopter ever. This is a great Agent's vehicle and can be used for your Town/City sets as a police helicopter...or rescue helicopter. It's just FANTASTIC!</p>
