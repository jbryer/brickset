"Lambman","2009-06-07T14:11:01.45Z","Excellent!","Well, lots of people hate this set, I know. But me, I dont understand why people hate it, it has a very nice design, nice minifigs and is just nice overall.

The King is upgraded from the original, and is now much cooler. 
His crown has a plume and he now has leg and back printing. All of the printing on him is new, except for the head and plate mail, which I hardly ever put on since it covers up his awsome printing.

Pros:
Figs
Dark Brown spears!
The wheels. I think they're new?
Weapons
Chariot is good overall

Cons:
Horse has no saddle
Perhaps a bit pricey, but its worth it.

9.5/10
Great Set!

"Brickman193","2009-06-23T04:16:27.623Z","The March of the King","Okay, this set is just pure awesomeness. It reminds me why I still collect LEGO. 

Since the re-release of Castle a few years ago, the King has only been found in the big, expensive sets. That's cool, but it really is great to have an affordable set with the King in it.

PRICE: $30.00 AUD. I don't know why many American collectors are complaining about the price, as it costs more over here anyhow.

MINFIGS: The King - the highlight of this set.  Revamped since his last appearance, the King now has a super-detailed outfit; golden crown, armour and sword, fully detailed body (back and front) and extra detail on the legs, right down to his light blue sash. The head is the same, but that's okay since his face was perfect to begin with. The knight is typical, not bad yet not special, as the trolls.

CHARIOT: The chariot is the main reason of the price. It dominates the set, both in size and design. Built from a lavish combination of dark grey, navy blue and gold, it complements the King and his treasure. Comes complete with 3 spears, a crossbow, a horse and two chains. What a score.

TREASURE: The treasure is well done. It's the same treasure from Indiana Jones' ""Race for the Treasure"", but I'm not complaining. It consists of a pearl gold chest and four gems (1 red, 1 yellow, 1 green and 1 blue). Once again, the colour helps the overall look of the carriage and the king. Such incredible treasure is a sure target for greedy trolls.

All in all, a worthy purchase. If you buy this and ""Drawbridge Defense"", you pretty much have the entire Court of the King.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lint","2009-10-24T07:09:18.06Z","Weakest Castle set of 2009","I didn't really want to buy this set at all because it didn't have much of what I wanted. (Trolls armed with brown spears? This is libel!) and it was damned expensive for what it was. But being a troll/castle collector and needing to purchase an item $20 or over to enter the Bricktober competition I decided to give it a shot. After assembling the rather solid mainframe of the chariot it suddenly dawned on me that I would be finished with building this set in less than 5 minutes and I probably wouldn't enjoy it. I began to nitpick on silly details like 'why is a battle chariot carrying a load of jeweled treasure?' and 'why is the king the driver? didn't history teach us that the mook was the driver and the king should be the one with the spear trying to make the kills?'. Anyway long story short I realised that I was unfairly judging the set and will now do a fair and balanced review. Short story long: anything by Dickens.

WINS
-The chariot is very sturdy
-Theres trolls!
-2 coveted troll shields
-King's golden chrome ornaments
-Decent assortment of weapons/accessories

FAILS
-Price
-Trolls armed with spears? Nonsense! Wheres the wicked troll scimitars?
-Troll 'captain' has no armour but has the copper helm
-Horse comes with head armour but no body cowling.
-Dull to build
-Comes with a single gold round stud as a spare. There were other pieces that were worth some spares too.

Overall I feel there was much room for improvement with this set in general. I would have been happier using my money to buy six 7078 'Troll Warrior' impulse sets (and I probably would have had they been available to me). At least they come with scimitars!

"lotographia","2009-09-06T02:55:39.217Z","This king ain't a-walking, he's a war king.","I bought this set mostly because I needed the king to compliment my Medieval Market Village - I already had the queen and the jester from the drawbridge set. The trolls... I wasn't so interested in. But I can give their simple wooden weapons to my villagers.

I have to say I'm a little perplexed by the chariot design and colour scheme. It doesn't look very authentically medieval to me... and it would have made sense to give the king's horse impressive 'barding', both because a bare horse seems inappropriate for a king's transportation and also so he could ride it without the chariot if he wanted to.

This set is nice, but I do think it could have been done better.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bassguitarplayer","2009-06-27T02:46:58.013Z","GREAT SET!","Just bought and put this set together.  What an awesome set.  I think the team building the Lego Castle sets is doing one of the best jobs of building new sets.  

A couple reasons I really liked this set. 

The construction and makeup of the chariot is awesome.  Very original and VERY creative.  One of my favorite parts.

The King....he's awesome.  He has a very detailed custom body, legs and armor set.  Also the King's helm has a plume in it now also. And the gold sword is great.  You will be glad you bought the set if just for the king.  

Four minifigs, a horse, a very creative chariot design.  

Totally worth.  $19.99 US is not too much.

I don't see any cons with this set.  I'm left with a great feeling that I bought and put together an original, well thought through set.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"deadtree103","2009-11-05T00:23:24.2Z","Better than people say it is.","Despite what quite a few people say about this set, it's one of my favorite sets.

THE MINIFIGS
*The new King figure is pure WIN. I mean, who can resist those beautiful printed legs and the chrome gold sword?(I had an old silver version a while ago, but I can't find it)I much prefer this style of sword to the tiny ones that the random soldiers have.

*The crownie figure isn't really anything special, but he does have the best torso out of the three that the Crownie's have. And he also has the type of helmet that I've never had before.

*The trolls aren't anything special either, but they each have the Troll shield (Which I can't get enough of). But  the Troll with the bronze helmet (Which I hate with a passion, as the gunmetal helmets look much better)looks disgusting with that Torso and the bronze helmet.

THE CHARIOT
It's actually really good. I've never seen that size of wheel before, and more gold flags are always welcome. really the only downside is that there is NOTHING to keep the chest from falling off the back.(I would have mentioned the price, but I got this as a birthday present, so the price doesn't matter)

Well now that that's done, I can get on with the Pro's and Con's.

PROS :)
*Awesome King.
*Chrome Gold sword.
*More Troll shields.
*New type of wheels(I think).

CONS :(
*Poor choice of helmets for the Trolls.
*Nothing stopping the chest from falling off.

Well, I give this set a 5/5. The Pro's heavily out weigh the Con's.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box and instructions for this set are quite good. They are nicely done. The box isn't too big, unlike most Lego boxes are these days.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has many good parts. The horse, the equipment for the figures, the pieces that make up the chariot, but mainly the golden treasure chest!</p>

I like pikemen, but this one is even better than usual. 9/10.</p><p><b>Troll Captain-</b>&nbsp;A nice minor commander for the Trolls. 7.5/10.</p><p><b>Troll Soldier-</b>&nbsp;Also a nice Troll soldier. 6.5/10.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>A pretty fun build. It was nice to see how this set goes together. There are also nice pieces that make up the chariot. 8/10.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>A nice chariot for the King. My main issue, though, is that the King is galloping through the Kingdom with only one guard! 7.5/10.</p>

The poor animal should be better protected, especially if attackers just have to kill this one to bring the whole chariot to a crashing halt.</li><li>The chariots huge wheels (= fast vehicle) stand in contrast to the one horse pulling it (= slooow).</li><li>The spears on the side look nice but are more of a hindrance to the enterprise (imagine a foe being hit by one of those - the whole carriage becomes highly unstable).</li><li>A vehicle used for the transport of treasure should be roofed and the guards able to see it at all times, i.e. there should be another guard at the back, behind the treasure.
