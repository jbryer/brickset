Now lets get to the review.

Pros+
- 7 Minifigures
- 2 New faces
- New Hair
- Golden Armour
- Queen and Jseture has a changeable face
- The grim reaper (dum dum dummmm!)
- Golden sword
- Great detail
- Not too pricey

Cons-
- A little dull
- Should of included new big flames

Overall, nice new set! I would recommend it to any castle fan, and even a city fan, since the new hair and faces are useable for civilians.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2009-06-08T11:18:29.39Z","You shall not pass!","I got this at TRU yesterday for 20% off. (Yes, against all probability, TRU was actually asking LESS than the S@H price for this puppy!) I could also have purchased the King's Battle Chariot on sale, but I didn't think of THAT until I was halfway home. (My TRU is about an hour away.)

Pros:
golden knight
Skeleton Rider/Grim Reaper
exclusive queen, jester minifigs both have double-sided faces
plenty of room in and around the drawbridge for fisticuffs
drawbridge winch mechanism

Cons:
The attention to detail is amazing. They even included a period-accurate missile launcher... Wait a minute...
That's really the only con.

If you truly like Lego Castle, pick this up. Or else... *shakes fist threateningly*

"sudorum","2009-06-22T15:53:45.11Z","A Jester at last!!","This set is a usual small castle set, complete with rare figures but not a so unique building. THis set is however useful as an add on to the castle siege set, on the side, or on the back. THe golden knight and jester are two especially unique figs,along with the princess. I suggest this set for you if you have a fettish for complete lego collections and/or rare minifigs. THe drawbridge has some sort of compartment under the first half, and a raiseable second half through use of chains and a turning gear. A little pricey, but its not much of a surprise now a days. still a good set, though",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

MINIFIGS

Jester- The Court Jester has a happy/sad switching face and a bow-and-arrow weapon to go with it. A version of this minifig appeared in the Castle Advent Calender that came out Holiday 2008. It was U.K. exclusive, unfortunately. (http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7979-1)

Golden Knight- He comes with a sheild and sword and epic Golden Armor!

Grim Reaper- He's cool with his scythe and his white skeleton horse (which first debuted as the thestrals in 5378 (Harry Potter 5 Lego Castle).(http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=5378-1)

White Skeleton- He has a spear.

Black Skeleton- He has a mace and a sheild.

Queen- She has a special hair piece that can hold a tiara, like Willie from the Indiana Jones Shanghai Chase set. (http://brickset.com/minifigs/?m=iaj026)

Knight- He's nothing special. He has a small sword.


BUILD

The build wasn't hard, and the contraptions were thought out well. The lion formation on the stone piece was orignally beige and used in some of the earlier LHP sets. The foliage pieces on the side of the ramp to the bridge aren't supported well.

CONTRAPTIONS

The drawbridge contraption was clever with the stopper to hold the bridge in any position.

OVERALL

There was no flaws or cons except maybe for the badly supported foliage.

I give this set 5/5 Stars! :)

"Zelyonii_Zaktan","2009-08-03T00:27:42.797Z","Wonderful view!","I bought this set only for adding jester, queen and knight to my collection. The box picture isn't very beautiful - and I thinked that tower is only two hundreds (not so much, yes?) of gray and hundred of blue pieces.
But it's not true! Really the tower with bridge looks wonderful, with skeletons on the bridges it's really a scene of epic battle! 
If you can't buy this set only for minifigs - buy it for wonderfull view and... some rare pieces. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bassguitarplayer","2009-06-27T02:58:56.967Z","GREAT BUY!","Just put this together and there are several elements I really liked.

The Golden Knight is awesome.  He has a custom chest piece, leg piece, and armor.  He also has a dark blue plume which I believe is new.  He is an AWESOME mini-figure.

The Jester is great since it was only available in the Christmas castle advent calendar which wasn't available in the US.

The queen with the crown is another GREAT mini-figure as the crown is a new feature.  Very nice.

The skeleton with the cape and cloak is a great addition also.

Lastly and very importantly, I love the draw bridge mechanism.  It is very creative and a great idea if you are building any of your own castle sets.  It works perfectly and even has a locking mechanism.  

For Cons....
The building construction is a little basic, but very creative none-the-less.  I like the front of the bridge and how they designed it.  I didn't really care for the ""harpoon"" or ""rocket launcher"" on the top of the tower.  

For the minifigs alone this set is worth it.  That and the draw bridge mechanism.  

Get the King's Battle Chariot also.  VERY good set, with an awesome King.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lint","2009-09-17T09:56:19.683Z","Get this set if you like unique minifigs","When I first saw the promo pics for this set I wasn't very impressed and didn't think I would buy it. Half a year later I have egg on my face

The set is actually more than meets the eye. Apart from the obvious appeal of unique minifigs (Queen, Jester, Golden General, Darth Skeleton) it also is quite fun to build and ends up being quite sturdy and impressive looking. Also unlike most sets these days you get what I would call a good amount and selection of minifig weapons/accessories. Heres my summary.

PROS
-Unique Minifigs
-Welcome return of the skeletons! God I miss these guys.
-Token castle soldier is not the same generic castle soldier we usually get. He has a smirky face!
-Rare Pieces (Lions Head Facia, Leafy corners)
-A golden sword!
-A good quantity of plate type pieces
-A good quantity of minifig weapons
-Fun to build
-Tower looks impressive and is actually spacious for a change. I'm sick of towers which have space for only one minifig per level.
-Ramp has hidden underside you can hide skeletons in
-Drawbridge sound/locking mechanism clever
-Nice box to store flickfire missles in, the 'cache of rockets' looks awesome


CONS
-Worst application of flickfire missiles EVER. They're mounted on a swivel which makes it stupidly difficult to actually flick them. Also looks ugly.
-Drawbridge doesn't close up completely
-Would have liked for the drawbridge to drop freely once the locking mechanism was released. Alas it does not.
-The queen is quite irrelevant to this set
-Hey theres a bridge... wheres the troll? :p
-If you dont consider unique minifigs as valuable. This set is not value for money

Overall a solid set that is well crafted and comes with many minifigs. Unfortunately, despite its merits, for the price you pay there are many other sets which would satisfy you more. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lotographia","2009-09-04T04:50:35.857Z","Quick! Someone give the queen a crossbow!","The Lego company can be rather crafty at times. I buy the Medieval Market village because it's beautiful and has the skirt I need for my pirate wench. But! I can't just have one castle set, maybe something with the queen and the king and the jester... oh wait! Released in the same year we find two sets incorporating all the minifigs I need to finish populating my Medieval Market Village. It's a very crafty move. I see no other reason for the queen and the jester to be included in this set.

I wasn't expecting much from the building itself, mainly motivated by the need for the Queen and the Jester and the Golden Knight, but I was pleasantly surprised... it may not be as detailed as the Market Village, but it doesn't look  particularly ugly or out of place next to them either. It stands higher than both of the buildings in that set, standing guard over the villagers as they go about their daily trade.

The one problem with the set is the drawbridge... I was hoping it would slam down when you lifted the release, but it usually just gets stuck and needs some encouragement. Gimmicks in Lego sets ofen have this sort of trouble. I won't mark the set down because of it though because I bought the set to compliment my village, not for the play value.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legoragon","2009-10-20T23:50:04.14Z","Great set but a few concerns","Alright so i bought this set when i went to the states one day and i thought it looked like a good set. Of course i was right so here are the pros and cons.

Pros- Good construction overall
         Lots of minifigs for such a small set
         Interesting design of building
         New drawbridge mechanism
         JESTER!!
         Wooden axes again

Cons- Ballista is out of place and i hate the whole ""flickfire missiles"" anyway
          Why are there skeletons in this era of castle i thought they were pass√©
          Ok a skeleton commander and 2 skeleton warriors against a golden knight, an infantry unit a guy with an awesome hat and a old lady with a weird hairpiece, not really a fair fight.

 other than those cons theres one other thing, the drawbridge doesn't go down all the way it kinda hovers above the other side. So good set bad choice of figs",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've other similar towers and outposts sets, not too many, so this helped to add to them for Castle. I also get a decent little army of skeletons and minifigures defending the Post. I had a lot of great fun building this set. What marred it for me though is the part of the set where the bridge comes down and connects to the ramp. This part of the set has always been prone to breaking and coming apart. Still, there are many good features such as the wench system for lowering and raising the drawbridge, the catapult at the top of the tower and the ""gargoyle"" piece decorating the front, it's more a lion though actually. Some very good detailing for this set and just added worth whileness when the real target were the minifigures in it.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

"Ernst","2012-05-08T14:35:10.703Z","Very good tower with excellent unique minifigures !","<p>Overall 5 bricks : A great Castle set with outstanding minifigures. Besides the very good Tower this set has 3 unique minifigures which alone make the set worth buying. A very good addition to the Fantasy Era collector but also very good single playing set and filled with usefull parts. Defenitly worth the full 5 bricks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building 4 bricks : Like almost all Fantasy Era sets oldfashioned building without too much big parts like walls etc. An awesome&nbsp;looking building with a good working drawbridge built on 2 rockparts with a small stream in front.&nbsp;Ground floor is the passage, on the first floor the drawbridge mechanism. On top of the tower which is made with 2 turrets on the side you find a rocketlauncher, a small catapult would have been better. Ground and first floor have open sides with a lot of inverted slopes which&nbsp;make the tower more broad and good to defend. When finished you built the passage connected to the drawbridge. Looks nice also with the grean leaf parts and the torches and the wooden passage. The water is one small blue plate, one more would have been nice. No building surprises with hidden traps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts 5 bricks : Simply the presence of <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=cas416"">the Queen</a>, the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=cas415"">Golden Knight</a>, the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=cas403a"">Jester</a> and to a lesser extend the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=cas378"">Caped Skeleton </a>make it 5 bricks here. Besides that the set is filled with great parts usable for all your own Castle creations, very good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability 5 bricks : A great tower with drawbridge and&nbsp;7 wonderfull minifigures plus Skeleton horse, all well armed, gives this set maximum playability. Great with a capital G.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value 5 bricks : <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=7079-1"">Bricklink </a>offers an average of some &euro;45,00 for this set. If you can get it for this price&nbsp;you should do it because only the 4 mentioned minifigures are almost&nbsp;worth it if you check Bricklink (Gold Knight alone &euro;15,00). I paid less so I&#39;m very happy, this set will only increase in value.</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-11T11:40:51.667Z","Bridge over troubled waters.","<p>The drawbridge design has a fairly illustrious history as far as Castle is concerned, and Drawbridge Defense feels very much like a spiritual successor to the Royal Knights' Royal Drawbridge (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6078-1"">6078</a>) that was released way back in 1995, although several drawbridge sets have been released for various Castle subthemes in the interim. The basic design for all of these sets is more or less the same: there is a ramp that leads up to the bridge, which usually has some built-in gimmick for tormenting would-be invaders, and this bridge is defended by a watchtower that houses a guard or two and possibly some treasure for story-telling purposes. To maximise playability, ""good"" and ""evil"" both get a Minifig showing, and thus conflict is&nbsp;born.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can already tell that Drawbridge Defense maintains this formula in a very rigid way, which is not to say that it is bad for this reason because the formula works.&nbsp;We&nbsp;have a ramp, a drawbridge that can be pulled up with a fairly rudimentary mechanism, a watchtower, and a variety of Minifigs. Put it all together and you've got the ingredients for a standard Castle set that is true to its roots, though unlikely to convert any newcomers to the theme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of particular note is this set's rather&nbsp;sizeable and eclectic collection of Minifigs. I feel that seven is a pretty generous number for a set of this size, to say nothing of the fact that three of them are&nbsp;unique to this set. On the Undead side - the first&nbsp;line of antagonists for the Fantasy Era humans prior to the introduction of the&nbsp;Trolls - we get two skeletal foot soldiers (one black and one white, for some reason) and a&nbsp;""Grim Reaper""-ish commander who sits astride a sweet skeletal horse. These&nbsp;guys are all cool, but I do wish that the Grim Reaper commander was made out of&nbsp;regular Minifig parts like the guy in Final&nbsp;Joust (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7009-1"">7009</a>)&nbsp;is because the skeletons are pretty spindly on their own; obviously, because they are skeletons. Still, there are enough Minifig odds and ends in this set for&nbsp;you to make your own&nbsp;Undead&nbsp;Minifig to replace the commander, should you so&nbsp;desire. Alternatively,&nbsp;you&nbsp;could&nbsp;sell a kidney and refinance your home and&nbsp;pick up a <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=852272-1"">Skeletal&nbsp;Battle Pack</a> or two to add to the carnage.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the ""good"" side, you've got four humans, though, funnily enough, there are two civilians thrown into the mix here - the queen/princess, and the cross-bow packing jester (!). It is nice to have non-soldier Castle Minifigs, and the jester will definitely find a home in Medieval Market Village (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10193-1"">10193</a>)&nbsp;if you have it, but what they are going to do in the face of this imminent conflict is not a question I can answer. For those who are so inclined to fall prey to traditional gender roles, I guess the queen/princess can play damsel in distress who can be thusly rescued by the very pimpin' gold knight, who is very cool, although sadly lacking in a large shield. This medieval&nbsp;Snoopp Dogg is accompanied by a generic foot soldier and...no one else. You'll have to find someone else to man the ballista turret at the top of the watchtower, unless you're willing to entrust it to the care of a civilian. It would have been nice to have an actual crossbowman instead of a jester, but then again, I guess it's easy enough to build a crossbowman of your own and have the jester fool around elsewhere. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The drawbridge itself is not the greatest looking thing in the world. Eschewing the use of a baseplate, the two parts of the bridge are instead connected by the blue ""river"" that flows between them. Why the ramp is hovering in space and otherwise skewing perspective&nbsp;in the render is beyond me, but you can be assured that everything rests flat when connected up in real life. The ramp is not particularly inspired, but one would probably argue that hey, it's a ramp, so what of it? I think I would have preferred stairs, but that would have rendered the skeletal steed useless. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be honest, I don't think I ever really understood the aesthetic of the Fantasy Era humans. Everything just feels very open and unfinished, and I kind of feel the same thing here, especially when compared against the sturdy completeness of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Castle&amp;subtheme=Kingdoms"">Kingdoms</a> sets, which succeeded these guys. Why the lion head motif when these guys have nothing to do with lions? What are the grey cheese wedge pieces supposed to represent? Why is the bridge adorned with weird vegetation at odd places? The design choices seem a little odd to me, which is sort of a shame considering how much thought went into the Undead, Troll, and Dwarf factions. Or perhaps it is only&nbsp;in comparison to these fantastic races that the humans seem to lack pizazz. Whatever it is, the Minifigs outshine the set itself here, which is strange,&nbsp;but I can tell from experience that the Minifigs were the bulk of the reason why I decided to eventually&nbsp;pick this set up. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unless you have a very strong affinity for&nbsp;the Crown Knights or otherwise need a place to house the knights that come with other factions' sets, Drawbridge Defense is probably a Castle set that you could do without, considering there are other much better castles out there. On the other hand, it is a great place to pick up a bunch of unique Castle Minifigs if you can get it for a good price. Perhaps there's something about the Crown Knights that I'm just missing; otherwise, I would say that this set is mostly mediocre. &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,2,3,5,3
"Acidicus","2020-01-03T10:34:19.7Z","Drawbridge Defense - a very nostalgic set","<p>Overall, this set is a prime example of a middle range castle set. A good build, a good price, but what sets it apart is the selection of minifigures.</p>

<p>So, to begin with the minifigures. This set contains seven, ranging from a golden knight to a queen&nbsp;and a skeleton warriors - a good mix indeed. My favourites&nbsp;among these include the jester and the knight, with the bold gold colour scheme. A skeletal horse is also included, which is a rather rare piece.</p>

<p>The building experience was normal, and it does not take too long to build.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;structure itself is imposing for this relatively inexpensive set, and the main build is not entirely a facade, as there is adequate depth to the model. The bridge can be raised and lowered quite well, although the mechanism may break at times. The other play feature is very basic, being the flick fire missile at the top of the tower.</p>

<p>So, to conclude, the set has a good and formulaic castle build, and an especially good UK price of &pound;27 (the set cost $40 in the USA). The set&#39;s worth comes from the selection of minifigures, all of which are good inclusions.&nbsp;</p>
