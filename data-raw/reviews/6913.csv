"JBH75","2009-06-13T21:38:27.903Z","The Ultimate Fortress!!","When I first saw this at the 2009 toy fair, I had to have it, and when I got this set, I was so happy and excited. This set has so much in it! Instead of using my usual pro/con list, I'm gonna break this down a bit further into subcatagories!<br/><br/>Minifigures: This set offers some excellent minifigures! 2 Giant Trolls with printed on tattoos and armour marks (no stickers), a female troll mage with an awesome magic staff (with green lightning), the troll king with a copper crown and a new head and a double-sided torso. There is also the king used in the battle chariot (without the sword and plume), which means he has a new torso and leggings! It also includes 3 knights and 2 more trolls but it's nothing new!!<br/><br/>Accessories: There are certainly alot of them this time. There are 4 troll scimitars, a staff with a green-lightning tip, 2 dark brown spears, 2 halberds, a glaive, 2 dark brown clubs, a horse with head armour and a saddle, one big castle shield, and a little one, and a chicken leg (troll bribery)!! It's a little dissappointing that TLG only included one troll shield in the set. <br/>Also there is a spider and a bat (I got lots of them!!)<br/><br/>Design: The design of this fortress is incredible. Much better in my opinion to the King's Castle Seige!! The design locks together in 6 sections: the gate, the prison tower, the 2 back walls, and the 2 front walls with the giant troll caves!! I'll have to break these ones down: <br/><br/>-The 2 front walls are really rocky and the towers on top of the troll caves have a brick-built catapult&nbsp;on top of each of them, which really work, and fire unbelievably far!!<br/>-The 2 side walls are sightly thinner than the front walls and have less protection, but are still really sturdy and cool to look at. <br/>-The prison tower very well designed. The only problem is that there is no 3rd wall on the lower section of the tower, which kind of dumb considering it is the back wall of the fortress. The prison like the one in the Pirates Soldier's fort: The back can be pulled off. Kind of makes it easier to place mini-figs in there.<br/>-The front is designed with giant gates insstead of a drawbridge like in the Castle Siege, and they are working very well. A reoccurence in the troll sets happens on the doors where you need to use flat bars on a slant. Also in the front of the fortress are 2 of the new giant flames. (You can also give them to the giant trolls. They make great flame-swords)<br/><br/>Overall: This set is a lot a playability and if well worth the $129.99! I strongly reccommend this set over the Castle Seige. It offers better mini-figures, design, and definitely more playability!! If you get this set, you definitely won't be dissappointed, or ripped off. <br/><br/>Thanks for listening!!",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"sudorum","2009-06-22T15:43:39.107Z","The Fortress of Behemoths","I'll start with the minifigs. You get two knights, a king, two regular trolls, and two giant ogres which have tatoos and designs on them. I'd have to say the ogress and troll king are the best minifigs. However, one let down was the troll king's crown, which is brown instead of bronze like the one shown on the box cover.&nbsp;<br>The fortress is smaller than the castle siege set, in height and in length. Instead of the usual drawbridge like most castles have, the fortress has two large doors. The top turrets have catapults on top of them. The side walls just inside of the doors have two falling axes; however, they are manual, so they're not really unique. The central tower has a potions room and a jail. Unfortunately, there is no detailed center to the fortress. It's blank, just like the King's castle.&nbsp;",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"Lint","2009-10-04T00:37:16.64Z","Impressive must have for troll lovers","The trolls are back in 2009 with a fortress of their own. This visually impressive set features a modular construction as well as fresh pieces such as the large fires, green lightning, troll king, troll sorceress, new giant trolls and tattered capes.

PROS
-This set is visually stunning. Design aesthetics come straight from the orc fortress in Heroes of Might and Magic V and are very pleasing.
-This set is visually stunning, oh wait I already said that
-The heads/faces on the troll king and sorceress are awesome
-2 Giant Trolls!
-The modular design makes for some really interesting arragements. You could turn this set into a troll castle, a long line of battlements or a series of separate tower modules. Great for play
-The prison chamber is large and spacious. You could imprison multiple minifigs in this one!
-The main doors are very impressive and include a halberd booby trap
-Tower catapults are functional and we should be glad there were no flickfires!
-Every minifig has a weapon, plus some surplus
-It comes with a human king who is beautifully decorated
-Overall great play value

CONS
-You get castle knights, and way too many of them in my opinion. These unnecessary and rather boring additions could have been spent on more awesomeness for the fortress or at least more trolls
-Troll Kings crown is brown and bland and he has no armour so he doesn't stand out at all. Couldn't they have gone for the coppery look than the troll captains helms come in?
-The standing space within each tower and behind the battlements aren't that great. 
-The actual construction of the set I found dull and quite symmetrical overall
-At full retail, price per pound is an absolute ripoff in my opinion

Overall if you're a troll lover this set is an absolute must have. This set does have its weaknesses but provides endless fun, especially if you have trolls from prior purchases to populate the fortress with.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"foreverthursday","2009-10-19T17:40:50.95Z","Not quite there.","I love the fantasy route that castle lego has undertaken. It reminds me of the merry days of the forest men and the wolfpack. 

I bought this set at Toys R' Us for just under a hundred dollars Canadian, and on sale it was the price this set should have been originally.

The issue that I took with this while piecing it together was that there were four wall units that were symmetrical carbon copies to one another. It made it a tad annoying doing the exact same thing twice two times in a row, and I have my doubts that if trolls were to exist that they would have such a distinct eye for accurate detail. I would love to be a fly on the wall for that board of director's meeting for planning ""mountain fortress operation crush humans and dwarves."" 

The set was really just the gate and the really awesome tower, which was the focal point of the set. The side wall units just seemed to be filler connecting the two.

The I am suprised that I found myself viewing this as anything under a four stars, but for what it is at the price tag it is. I can't see it being anything else. It is great for your castle collection, but not so much as a stand alone piece. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Harmonious_Building","2011-04-26T08:22:32.613Z","The most orderly Troll fortress you'll ever see.","I somehow suspect that most LEGO collectors largely prefer order to chaos, but I think that the Mountain Fortress may be the exception.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>But first, the good points: it's pretty rare that antagonists in the LEGO Castle world get a full-fledged base to call their own, but the Trolls of the 2007 Castle line are the exception, and their base can certainly hold its own against those irritating do-gooders who feel like spoiling their plans. The completed fortress has a great sense of scale to it, and when finished and connected up in the recommended arrangement, is surprisingly wide, and the central tower is actually fairly tall, something that the angle on the box doesn't quite capture. Additionally, like most of the newer castles, the fortress splits apart into separate components, allowing for a fair bit of modularity; the Troll caves on either side of the main gate actually function quite nicely as standalone outposts. The fortress' colour scheme meshes very well, and the cow-horn fixtures and rocky textures give the entire castle a very rough and cobbled-together look, particularly appropriate for anyone who was weaned on the Heroes of Might and Magic series.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Minifig wise, the large Trolls are guaranteed to put a dent in the forces of good, and the exclusive Troll King and Troll Sorceress will surely give your Troll army a rallying point, if it really is the case that Trolls rally. I think that four Crown Knights is somewhat excessive, though, considering that this is meant to be a Troll set; I would have much preferred an extra Troll or two in lieu of a couple of the knights.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The build for this set is unfortunately where it has to get knocked down a few points, the primary reason being that the side towers and side walls are exact mirror images of each other, something that Humans might be able to get away with, but not Trolls. I suppose a bit of symmetry is inevitable when it comes to castle building, but it seems particularly incongruous as far as Trolls are concerned. Instead of having two Troll caves for the large Trolls, one of them might have been replaced with a mess hall, and one of the walls might have served as a small barracks. Of course, the symmetry can be easily undone with a little bit of creativity, even if it means something as simple as rearranging the cow-horn adornments.</div><div><br></div><div>If you're anything like I am and are always secretly rooting for the antagonists, you'll definitely want to make sure your bad guys have a base, and this would be the one to go for. After all, what would life be like if everyone were shiny and well-behaved all the time?</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"Ernst","2012-07-02T17:47:46.593Z","The evil home of the Troll King, the final Fantasy Era Fortress","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks :</strong> The third Castle in this theme and just as good as&nbsp;The King&#39;s Castle Siege&nbsp;in my opinion. Maybe seems a bit overpriced but not if you&nbsp;consider you can&nbsp;use this both as a closed Castle and an open Fortress, a bit in the style of <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=9474-1"">Helms Deep</a>. The set has great minifigures and huge playability, the only problem is finding it for a reasonable price. I only can advise if you find it for a reasonable price&nbsp;to get it, certainly if you are a collector.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks :</strong> Like the other big Fantasy Era sets the built is modular.</p>

<ul>
	<li>First the main gate : A great part to built with a mix of most dark&nbsp;and light gray small bricks en slopes and a big skull on the front center and 2 big torches on cones in front. Two massive wooden doors in front and 2 big axes hidden behind the doors.</li>
	<li>Left and right Tower with wall : Both parts are the same but mirrored. The&nbsp;down floor of the tower is the hideout of the 2 huge trolls, backside is made of two rockparts and sidewalls of small bricks light and dark grey and brown. The wall attached to it with hinges is a big rockpart with a wooden balustrade. First floor of the tower is a defence room built of two panels and small bricks, the top floor is built with brown parts which gives it a wooden look and has a good working big catapult.</li>
	<li>Left and right side wall : again two equal parts built on 2 plates connected with hinges. Not too hard to built because of the use of a panel, a big and a small wall parts. Brown plates are used as walk passages and some grey and brown bricks and plates as tilts. Both walls have a ladder as entrance and places to hide inside.</li>
	<li>Back center tower : The Troll Queen&nbsp;or Sorceress hide out is the best part. The down floor is formed by 2 small and one big rockpart and made solid with small bricks and is a kind of hiding place. The first floor, the Sorceress magic room, is made most of 2 wall panel and slopes and contains a Crystall ball etc. The second floor is the prison made of straight and bend fence parts, a door in front and removable fence on the back. The top floor is made in the center of brown (wooden) parts with&nbsp;a grey tower on each side, the Sorceress look out post. A big brown stair in front to enter the first floor. The tower can be used both loose as back center of the Fortress or as rear towerwall of the Castle.</li>
	<li>The whole Fortress is decorated with white teeth on brown cones and red teeth on the wooden parts and has several torches.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks :</strong> All great parts in this set. First the minifigures with a special remark for <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=cas421"">the Sorceress</a> and the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=cas420"">Troll King</a> with Crown. A huge load of brown and grey 2x1x3 slopes, the rock parts are usefull too and the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=47990"">bigg skull</a> is great too. Great use of colors being light and dark gray and brown.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks :</strong> I think I don&#39;t need to explain these 5 bricks, the result and content says it all. Besides that you could simply add this set to for instance a LotR scene, it would fit in great.</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks :</strong> a normal price for a used set like this should in my opinion be some &euro;60,00 average. I think it wasn&#39;t sold as massive as for instance <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7094-1"">The King&#39;s Castle Siege</a> so it&#39;s harder to find it used which explains the high average of &euro;75,00 <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=7097-1"">Bricklink</a> offers as average. Overall, esspecially if you are a Castle collector, it is worth it I think <strong>if</strong> you can find it.</p>

"jethroo","2011-06-20T18:33:26.11Z","far to expensive for original price but for discount its ok","<p>I really like the orcs'n'trolls in this subtheme. I was stamped in my early years with the very first castle lego came up with and since then fantasy, knights, medieval etc. seems to be a part of me. So actually this set is rotating out of stores these days so you get a 50% discount on them, that would be 50€ for this set in Germany, wonder how long this will take. But with the original price of 100€ i would have been somehow disapointed (i think). I like the modular builds with no base plate which renders them somehow extensible. Actually i'm just thinking of getting another set for the discount brice to build a really big troll castle.</p><p><br></p>Compared to 7094 the build is somewhat easyer depending on the couple of big wall peaces utilzed for building, especially for the side walls, but in 7094 the walls are also more powerfull not as thiny as in this set. Although the set is about to rescue the king from this castle additionally weapons would have been great for the king for fighting his way out. And maybe a hourse for the king too. Who is rescueing the king without bringing an appropriate ride?<br><br>The minifigs are great in this set; i love this orc shaman!<br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>great minifigs (2 kings (orc + crownys), shaman and infantry)<br></li><li>modular extensible build</li><li>great evil look<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>no weapons and ride for the king<br></li><li>much of clumsy wall parts<br></li><li>original price<br></li></ul>

"daibaron","2015-07-27T15:50:26.997Z","A good yet confusing set","

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box are big and great looking but misguiding since the image of the fortress in the front do not match with the real fortress in built mode. The real built is more plain than the one in the front picture. Also, at the back side, the box barely able to hide the merely few playability of the set (which compared to other similar set is a pittance). Instructions comes in 2 booklets and easy to follow</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Another great side of this set...so many cool parts : plenty of white horns, chicken thigh, skull, spiders, bats....too many to mention</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures 5 stars</h3>

<p>The minifigures are great with two giant trolls (ogres?) in two cool different color, the troll king (finally, we see the big boss) with cape, the troll wizard with same cool cape and a disfigured face (for having too much lighting spells, I guess) , two generic yet great looking trolls , the human king and assorted soldiers.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build are pretty boring with twice repeating sections (the tower and side walls) , however, the front gate and the tall tower with jail is pretty fun to build</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As mentioned in this review&#39;s title : it is a confusing set....too chaotic to be a castle but too structured and squared to be believable as troll&#39;s dwelling.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am disappointed with the overall look of the set. When I opened the box initially, I was expecting something as cool as the dwarves&#39; mine set and what I actually get is something in between cool and boring. Thankfully, the parts are great , and also the minifigs just awesome and they still part of my collection to this day</p>
