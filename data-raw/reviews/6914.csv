Good:
1. Building Tecniques: It has a couple of interesting building techniques like the are intakes on the sides, etc.
2. New parts: It has at least 2 elements I did not know before.
3. Two models to choose from, I went for the convertible (spyder) which is much more fun with the retractable rooftop. 

Bad:
1. Stickers... not the best look, etc, etc
2. I'd wish this was a Technic set like the Ferraris, I hope Lego releases one, bigger, working engine, etc..
3. Wheels don't turn (but that is pretty much standard in the Racers of this type anyway).

"masacra","2009-08-12T19:09:26.42Z","Just great!","I wanted to get this one way before it got out. It looked great already on the pictures. So I bought it...
This set is very nice. It looks very good and I like it lot better than the FXX. I built the convertible version, because the functionality of hiding the roof is nice. And the whole model looks pretty realistic and detailed. It is just a must have!

Just when I put it next to the FXX I thought, that it would be a lot better if Lego would make all these model same scale...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2009-12-29T08:39:22.327Z","Bullish Looking Spyder","Had this set since it was released in the summer, but for various reasons only just got round to making it over the Christmas break.

There are 2 instruction booklets for 2 versions - either a hardtop coupe or a retractable soft-top Spyder. I decided to make the Spyder version as I was intrigued by the folding roof mechanism which works quite well.  As has been said they are quite different construction towards the end, so you really need to decide in advance which one is for you.

Overall construction is similar in to the Ferraris, but there is an interesting upside down brick assembly used to make the side intakes and the construction at the front is a good attempt at creating the distinctive shape rather than just rely on stickers. Mercifully there are few stickers on this set, mainly confined to the interior. Headlights have to be stickers, and the rear of the car looks good, but the rear lights are stickers. The interior is very good, with stickers for detail, and on a whim I decided to convert mine to right hand drive UK version (never bothered before), which just meant transposing the parts. Top of the centre console obscures lower part of the centre console when fitted making the sticker on the latter a waste of time really as you can’t see it.

The opening doors are a welcome bonus over previous Ferraris (apart from FXX) and look good and work well.

I had a problem with my set in that the quality control on some of the yellow bricks was not quite up to standard as they are noticeably a different shade and feel ""softer"" and this shows in the door areas in particular which look decidedly patchy. 

I realise some compromises have been made on colours of partsfor both versions, but one thing I could not understand why use 1 x 2 plates with ugly studs on the top of the rear wings when 2 x 1 flat tiles to match the rest of the smooth profile look so much better? I also felt the inside of the roof needed to be black not yellow, and the 1 x 8 brick with extension at the top of the windscreen doesn’t really engage as it should with the underside of the roof – narrower versions of same brick will probably do the trick. Once again there are odd colour choices for some parts - why one grey plate on the underside when all the rest are black? 

I enjoyed the build, working features, overall appearance and lack of stickers. However, I also felt this set was £10 overpriced – especially compared to its predecessors – for that price the yellows really should have all matched perfectly. Due to the niggles, I can only give it a 4.

I think they could have made real wheels and low profile tyres instead of wheel covers it would have made this set something special. more detail in the engine would also have been nice.
 For say $70 this set would be very nice but for $100 I was disappointed. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Dentarthurdent","2009-09-13T20:05:24.327Z","Great. Think it could be better? Do it Yourself!","This is a great, fun build. Nothing to rave about but satisfying nonetheless. The interior is top notch and the rims spectacular. The rear of the hard-top version is stunning. The convertible feature of the alternative model is smooth. Definitely, the choice to have both the Spyder and Coupe was a good one by Lego. This way, if you're slightly bored with one, you just build the other. And I got to say, I was surprised by how different each of the models were. I thought I could simply pick out a few bricks from the rear and make the other model in a few minutes, but it was not so. The two models differ significantly in their 'rear workings.' It takes a good 45 minutes to alternate models.

However, the front of the car is slightly disappointing. It is far too cumbersome and 'boxy,' and the stickers, while not all that bad, give a jarry appearance. I was not happy with the look and proceeded to take some positive action. With the pieces provided in the set itself and a few others I was able to modify the buffer area to great success. I mainly used flat plates to cover the ugly studs and get rid of that 'squarish' look.

Without a doubt, it is the rear of this model that is its strength. Both the models feature a 'pleasant to look' rear-view and a slightly disappointing frontal view. The latter is easily remediable. Having alternative models was a great idea by Lego and should be compounded upon in the future. 

5/5 for satisfying my eyes on more than one occasion, and for allowing me to feel good about myself as a result of the positive modifications I made.

That was really sweet. um, it took me about 5 hours, but im not the fastest builder out there. Definatly recommend it. i paid 60 bucks at walmart in california. just for referance.",FALSE,5,5,5,4,5
"Lexhoya","2011-03-07T03:10:07.983Z","Must agree with Dunnemaster419","<p>When I buy a set, I want the set to either be a one of a kind, or a set I can us for parts (after building the default models), or you can use it to make your own MOC's. This set, like many of the special models in the racers/technics ranges are made for one purpose: the set itself. Nevertheless I try to make other models out of them.</p><p>The thing that attracted me most, is the rich detail on doors, dashboard, chairs, enginebay and hood. The rims are noice, but not particularly the first thing (for me) to buy this set for.<br><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Two models, both of them nice to put up for display<br></li><li>The mechanism, and details are really well done</li><li>No matter under what angle you look at the set, it is always detailed on the outside<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Stickers are on more than one Lego-part, making it difficult to take apart.<br></li><li>Only the two models can be made<br></li><li>Too low to the ground, so it will not fit on any other MOC/Model.<br>Not possible to make PF's inside, because of the tiny bay and area to fit it in (but this is not the main reason to buy this set I guess).<br></li></ul>
<p>If you want to have a model of a car on the shelf that you will probably never drive or buy, this is a really beautiful set to have. If you look around on the web for this model, under several angles, the only conclusion to draw is that this set is well designed and well detailed. My final score with the parts was mainly determined by the number of parts and the parts that make the detailing possible, not because they are so rare.<br>At present, this model is built and stands on the back of a trailer of my large car taxitruck (with two other models), while it should be racing around.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"Firehawk2448","2010-06-24T23:34:48.81Z","Awesome authentic model.","<p>I hit the jackpot when&nbsp;I found this right under a Hero Factory at TRU.&nbsp; I was shocked because I have not seen this set <em>anywhere</em> in my area.&nbsp; This was only in the Lego catalog last year but not in the online shop.&nbsp; When I looked the set number up on the shop it said: This product is not available in your country or region.&nbsp; It was also on the Walmart site but it told me the same thing.&nbsp; I don't know what the heck its doing in the US, cause I notice most reviews on it are not from Americans.</p>
<p>Ok, so now to the set.&nbsp; I built the Spyder because it's got the functional roof.&nbsp; It took me two and a half hours to build.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are nine bags of pieces in the box, which I think is a lot.&nbsp; The detail is amazing though.&nbsp; The hood, trunk, and doors all open.&nbsp; It even has its detailed V-10 engine located behind the seats.&nbsp; It is about 1:18 to 1:16 scale, so it's pretty big.&nbsp; The only downside is the stickers.&nbsp; There's a lot of them.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a great set.&nbsp; It was a little pricey at $62.99 USD plus tax at TRU, but well worth it.&nbsp; If you like model cars or Lambos, this set is for you.&nbsp; I give it a 5 out of 5.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

The first thing that I was a little annoyed with was that the piece bags were divided by sequence in the instructions (the 8214 Polizia version did this)-made it easier and more fun to build.<br><br>Comparing this set (8169) to the other set (8214).<br>Interior- 8214 wins (more realistic)<br>Hood design- 8214 wins (more realistic)<br>Headlights- 8214 wins (stickers are weak-8169)<br>Front bumper- 8214 wins (shaped better, and longer)<br>Roof- 8169 tied with 8214, but 8169's idea was good, but not 100%<br>Overall look- 8214 wins<br><br>Both cool sets, but 8214 far more superior than the 8169.<br>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,2
