The blue pickup and the police monster is absolutely good,but not on the elevated chassis. Very good to make a replica police SUV of the Bridge Chase kit,but in this monster form it&#39;s 2/5 rating only,due to the unrealistic design. The huge tires are having holes on their backsides,this was disappointing for me. Same issue applies on the blue pickup,as that shares the tires of the police truck. BUT. Literally disliking the monster chassis of the police and the blue pickup,i was amazed by the other two truck&#39;s tires. I&#39;ve never seen these ones before on any LEGO set,so this little surprise made me smiling,after my disappointment. Nah enough of the tires and wheels,i just have to note one more thing. The police and blue truck has the same rims of the 8134 monster truck (Night Crusher).</p>

<p>The red truck is also fine for a street car,on different wheels and detached from the lifted chassis. Very good design,5/5 definitely. White hot rod truck also has the same rating and opinion of mine,5/5. Only the bionicle hook looks hilarious,i removed it completely. The crushed yellow car. Basically replica of the 8120-8121 design,few parts differ only. Looks awesome,when parked next to the 8134 yellow crushed car.</p>

<p>Ramps. Flags. Flames. Decorative addition,just as in real life on a monster show. The dual ramp&#39;s centerpiece has the ability to hold together the two ramps,so if you lift up the centerpiece,the two ramps won&#39;t fall to the ground. I liked this feature. Counter to the slammer,that is unable to launch the police truck and the blue truck,their wheels stuck to the slammer&#39;s chin.</p>
