"dragon_teenager","2009-05-21T12:57:47.7Z","Great value, excellent SP3 starter set! ","LEGO Space has returned! This brilliant little set is a great way to sample the extraordinary Space Police line. I'll break it down into pros and cons:

PROS: Most notably, it's a super-cheap way to get the Squidman, who is a brilliant little minifig. You also get a Space Police minifig, and I think they are quite nice as well (leastaways, far better than those MM space suit figs). That's two figs for an incredibly cheap price! The vehicle it comes with is also quite nice. I very much like the overall swooshability. 

CONS: The set includes quite a few stickers. Unfortunately, without them, the vehicle looks very bland.


Overall, this set is great for the price. Two great figs and an at least acceptable vehicle. For a set this small, this is as good as it gets! I highly recommend it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Nightshroud99","2009-05-21T18:26:01.187Z","P Squiddy","I am writing my first review today and its on a really fun set. The set is none other than the brand new Space Police Squidman's Escape! With two great minifigures this is a very good set for your money, as it only costs $7! Anyway I'll do a pros and cons system to review this set.

PROS:
Squidman (aka P Squiddy) He is awesome! My favorite alien minifigre from the space police line so far and I also have Frenzy and Krannx.
Police Officer. Nice head and cool new body with printed legs and back. He also has a double sided face : )
Speeder Bike (I believe LEGO called it the raptor) Its a cool bike, I like it more than the police bike in Freeze Ray Frenzy.

CONS:
Stickers. Stickers don't really bother me so its not really a con for me. But other people hate them.
The set is small. But thats to be expected...

Anyway I hope you liked my first review and get this set if you haven't already, its a great Space pOlice starter set. Also check out my YouTube page! I make LEGO reviews regularily and am ver popular. http://www.youtube.com/user/Nightshroud99",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The speeder is incredible for being so small. The fact that it is curved adds to the realism. It makes you feel like the set is hovering. Also; the Squidman is unique and funny.

The Space police fig has a very cool printed torso (both sides are printed!) and printed legs as well. The head and helmet are descent and they fit well for the theme. Squidman (The alien on the left) also has a cool torso. The red cape is a cool addition with the plastic (not rubber!) head. The speeder is awesome, especially with the 2 front 'blasters' and the types of pieces they use. It also has stickers (sigh). Here are the Pros and Cons:

The police officer is good.  I like his double sided head.  The helmets are cool.  The double sided torso is a nice touch.

I gave the police officer a hand held machine gun from one of the Batmen sets and a pair of handcuffs and it really increased the playability of the set.  I don't know why Lego doesn't do something like this.  Two more pieces can't cost that much.  It seems like they are really stingy on putting handcuffs in sets.  Police usually have both guns and handcuffs in the real world.

The police bike is okay but not that great.  I never use stickers if I can avoid it.  The way the police officer fits on the bike is not great.  My son put Squidman on and it looks cool like he is flying really fast on the bike with his cape in the air.

This set is a great set. I can't see one flaw with the design or price with this set. It comes with a $100 bill(yay im rich!) for squidman to steal. That's always a plus. The officer has a printed body, legs, and back. I don't know exactly what the vehicle is supposed to be but it has a great 'swoosh' factor to it.

Minifigures:

Squidman: My favorite minifigure in my whole entire collection. You get a double sided torso with a unique head. Also it comes with a red cape which is very rare nowadays.

Police patroller: I like the space patroller. Like squidman his torso is also printed on the front and back. he also comes with a helmet and a shield. 

Vehicle: The vehicle might be small but once you build it you notice how great it really is. the decals on the front and side go perfectly with it. The aerodynamics of the little scooter are also quite nice. INTERESTING FACT: I found that if you lift the hood or front cover of the hood you can store the hundred dollar bill there.

Overall: I reccomend this set to anyone. Whether your a fan of space police or not you should go buy this small set which has very intricate features. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kcrmccoy","2009-06-18T11:15:06.467Z","P-Squiddy is on the Loose!","I picked this new set up from the Lego Store after the Darth Vader speed build. Let's get started:

Box:
        - Front - Cool and basic. You can see an actual city in the right corner below the space police words. 10/10
        - Back - Disappointing. All it has is the cop off his hover bike capturing Squidman (With no handcuffs I might add). And that takes up the entire back box. 5/10

Building:
        - Speed - This set only takes 5-10 minutes (10 minutes if you're my 4 year old brother and 5 minutes if you're me) 10/10
        - Difficulty - This set is very easy except for the 5 stickers that come with. Otherwise, in the words of Geico, ""It's so easy, a caveman could do it."" 9.5/10
        - Instructions - The instructions have 19 steps (7 sub-steps) with a light blue background. In the back of the instructions, it shows all the alien criminals and SPIII sets. 10/10

Playability: The playability in this set isn't quite what I was expecting, but don't get me wrong, This is a good set. P-Squiddy doesn't have a vehicle and the cop doesn't have handcuffs. Luckily, I have some from handcuffs from a Batman set. Me and my little bro play with this all the time though.
8/10

Price: 42 pieces for $6 (USD) is ok, with an average of 14 cents (USD) per piece. They could have had it for $5. Or for $6 they could have put in more pieces. 8/10

PROS:
- Speeder Bike has a nice design
- Space police minifig has a double face (Happy and Scared) and double printed torso.
- P-Squiddy is also has a double printed torso and new head.
- Came with 4 extra pieces

CONS:
- 5 stickers (Not too bad)
- Only one 100 dollar bill (Why would a robber only rob that much?)
- Price could have been lowered
- Squidman doesn't have a speeder or something

Although this set has an even amount of pros and cons I would recommend it to any one. You would mainly get this set for Squidman (I did), but it also has some very surprising things too (Speeder bike). In conclusion, this set is a 9! (Rouded off from 8.6)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jkool","2009-09-18T17:47:54.28Z","Perfect!","Although there is not much in the set, what it does come with is stylish and an excellent way to build up your SP3 collection with minifigures and parts.

The little police speeder has some excellent SNOT work that will serve as a useful starting point for anyone interested in learning some SNOT techniques. The best part is that if you pick up a couple of these sets, all of the curved bricks and pieces on the speeder can absorb very easily into a larger SP3 spaceship! That means this set is not only great for getting some minifigures, but also for extra pieces to beef up your other space police sets.

"Ovid07","2009-06-28T16:13:08.747Z","Awsome Space Police 3 Sampler!","Intro:
I recently received this set from Legoshop.com along with sets 5970 and 5971, and I am very impressed with Space Police 3 so far.  Now I just have to order 5974!

The Squidman:
The real highlight of this set is the new alien villain, Spuidman, who seems to have become an instant favorite and icon for the new theme.  He has green legs, arms, and a double printed torso with a shell-like design on it.  The head couldn't be any better as his red eyes show great expression, and you just have to laugh when you see his mouth and tongue.  This in my opinion, he is the best thought out and best overall alien villain Lego has produced so far.

The Space Police Officer
I truly don't have much to say about the new space police officers as they seem like a given thing to expect.  I would like to mention however, that they have nicely double printed torsos and printed pants.  I am also a bit disappointed that Lego decide to make them darker and less colorful than in the past Space Police Themes.

The Hover Bike Thing:
The bike is fairly small as it is only thirty pieces, but is still a great main vehicle for the set.  First, it is very well designed so even though more advanced building techniques are used, it still stays together.  Second, it is very eye pleasing, and is surprisingly swooshible (Yes, not only spacecraft can be swooshible).  The only con is that minifig's feet can't quite connect to the studs when holding the handle bars.

The Stickers:
This is the main thing that really saddens me, and the main mistake (in my eyes) Lego seems to be making these days.  I mean, it just seems pointless to put five stickers on a thirty or so piece bike!

Great small Space Police 3 set and an excellent ""sampler"" for Space Police 3 overall. 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"krysto2002","2009-07-20T17:43:31Z","Histroy repeats itself, but this time there are 2 figures...","That about sums it up. A classic example of small vehicle, which we've seen many examples of, such as the Galactic chief (SP II) or Pulsar charger (M:Tron). But this time, the major flaw that they all had has finally been fixed; now there are 2 minifigures!

The set features a small speeder, which has no seat, but still manages like a jet-ski. The speeder also has a pop open hood (engine?) and the pilot can be laid down or stood up to simulate high speed. Squidman is currently a unique figure (but this won't last) and this set is the easiest way to get him. He looks really cool and will come in handy for plenty of MoCs, plus both torsos are double sided. The set loses its fifth star because A: the set could be a dollar cheaper, B: it is covered in stickers, and C: there are no accessories, not even handcuffs.

Pros:
-2 minifigures
-Squidman with cape
-Detailed
-Great small set
-Stickers are better quality
-Pop open hood
-Double faced officer (scared/confident)

Cons:
-Slightly overpriced
-Could use accessories such as a spray paint bottle or handcuffs
-Too many stickers
-SP helmet doesn't cover 2nd face

As anyone who has bought a SP 3 set has noticed, there are a lot of extra parts which can often be used to customize your sets. Here is what I did.

"Paradoxymoron","2009-06-30T09:46:35.247Z","Why Squidman?","Well, I got this awhile ago (I really wanted Freeze Ray Frenzy but with the other sets I got, I didn't have enough money....). Anyway, I put it together quick and admired most of this small little thing. MOST being the key word. Squidman. I never liked Squidman from the pictures of this set and I still don't like him now.

Squidman Pros:
Uhhh... none

Squidman Cons:
He has a green body and a red cape. I don't think green and red work together.
His head is gray. Gray! The rest of him is green (minus his hands) and he has a gray head! Why?
Overall I just don't think he's all that great.

Space Police Officer Pros:
Double-printed head
double-printed torso
printed legs
Looks cool
Helmet visor is shiny....... :P

Space Police Officer Cons:
No equiptment (BUT it is a small set so I won't hold that against it)
Doesn't resemble old Space Police Guys (see end of Review)

Raptor Pros:
Two freeze ray cannon things
Nice shape
Hood lifts up
They didn't drown it in stickers! There's actually five but they aren't that bad.

Raptor Cons:
Applying the black stickers that say ""Police"" can be confusing because you put them on upside-down then flip the piece over

Anyway, I thought it was a pretty good set. It gave me a few cool Space Police lll stuff (and Squidman.... :() And earlier when I said the Space Police Officer didn't resemble the old ones, I think I might know why: Since these sets are aimed at younger kids, most of them probably have not seen the original Space Police (I loved Space Police ll) so LEGO wouldn't need to make these like old nes if their targeted ge group wouldn't remember them. 

And there we go, a perfectly good set (and Squidman) for a small price. I suggest that if you want to try out this theme, get this set. It's small, cheap, and pretty good all around (except for Squidman)

Police Officer:
Nothing too special, it's just a police officer. He has a printed torso and a double sided head, one being 'smiley face' and the other 'OMG I am so scared!' face. Unfortunately, he has no airtanks.

Squidman:
Personally, I like Squidman because of the head. The part on his head is similar to the pattern on the crab in the Crab Crusher set. The red cape...thing does not quite go well with his green body and legs.

$100 Bill:
I think this is a neat touch as it shows Squidman did steal something. Although it is not realistic (compared to AUS money), it makes its point with '100' on it.

Raptor:
This seems to be the main point of this set. There are 5 stickers! The police officer fits neatly onto the Raptor but is unable to stand securely because there are no studs he can stand on while holding onto the handlebars. It's shape is streamlined. The build of the Raptor is simple but it is quite fun to play with.

Pros:
Squidman at a cheap price
Raptor is simple, but fun to play with
Police has double-sided head
$100 bill

Cons:
Squidman's colour scheme is questionable
Police has no airtanks
Squidman has no vehicles

PROS:
If you've read my other SPIII reviews, you'll know how much I praise the SPIII minifigs. Squidman is a wicked awesome figure. The cape gives him a psycho type look, IMO, and although the Police Officer doesn't have airtanks, he is still an excellent figure. Best of all, this set's particular figure has a face with two expressions!

CONS:
The officer's vehicle, named the Raptor if I'm right, is disappointing. First off, it should be noted how good I thought it looked on the box. But when you build it, you learn that the officer's feet don't attach anywhere! He just hangs on to the steering handles and balances on the thing!

He probably should have come with a pair of handcuffs as well.</li><li><b>$100 bill</b> - Squidman is apparently quite the petty thief, he's being apprehended for stealing a mere 100 spacebucks (although, that's probably something like $1,000,000 in today's currency, what with inflation and all).</li></ul></div><h4>Parts</h4><div>For a small set, this one packs in a LOT of useful pieces, including two 1x4 bricks with studs on the side, four angled slope/curve bricks, one technic 1x2 w/two holes, and hinges. The omni-present 1x1 cheese slopes in translucent red and translucent blue (well, omni-present for SP3, anyway) are here to serve as the police flashers (and you even get an extra set) and two translucent green cones serve as dual-barrel freeze-ray blasters. For a set so small, there are quite a few stickers, but they add detail, so it's not a big deal.</div><h4>Build</h4><div>The main 'hull' of this speederbike-ish vehicle is comprised of the four angular slopes, with a hinge in the middle to add a little offset and visual interest. The larger pair up front are held on sideways by the two 1x4 bricks w/studs on one side, in a clever SNOT configuration. Between them sit the freeze-ray blasters, which is then covered by the white 'flag' piece as a sort of hood (or bonnet, depending on your geographic location). The end result is not unlike a hovering jet-ski, and I'm surprised we haven't seen civilianized variations floating around on flickr or mocpages to that effect (in fact, that's a thought - I may do something like that soon. I could see it in orange and yellow, or dark blue and white.)</div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>For $6(US) this is a good deal, and I have a hunch it will drop in price soon, making it even better.

In the not too distant past I needed more space so I chose to donate them to my young cousin so she could enjoy the LEGO universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with these new Space Police 3 Sets I decided to once again pick up some Space theme sets. Especially with the brand new alien mini-figures included with these sets. That plus the brand new printing on the Space Police Officers is also a plus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is the cheapest, aside from the Impulse sets, from the Space Police 3 sub-theme. It involves building one Police vehicle, the mini-figures of course and that's pretty much it. I honestly don't mind that, if they gave Squidman a vehicle of some type too the price would jump up a little and might turn some parents off from buying it for their child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vehicle in question is a nice little speeder and fits in quite nicely on display with any other Space themed vehicles, even the Star Wars stuff. The Mini-Figure can ride it quite nicely, the Police Officer is really impressive. I especially like the new printing for the uniforms, it offers up a unique look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Squidman, one of the main reasons for why I purchased this set, is a nice looking alien. The torso and legs of course are standard sized LEGO body parts, but have been given a neat looking print design to allow the new head piece to stand out even more. Squidman is well worth the price of admission alone, by now it's harder to find as the Space Police 3 sets are becoming more and more scarace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value wise I think this set is well worth the price, and it offers up a lot of fun for children and adults as well, building the speeder takes no time at all and then you can start having adventures with your Space Police Officer and Squidman, the villainous alien thief. My one wish is that LEGO should have given us a brand new wierd looking alien print dollar bill. I think it'd look fresh and new.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
