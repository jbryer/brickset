"ronbonne","2009-05-21T11:56:29.03Z","Not very exciting","I believe Lego has spoiled us somewhat with the Indy sets, Creator and City etc., because the smaller Space Police III sets are a bit bland. This set (5970, Freeze Ray Frenzy) is no exception. Lego is continuing the practice of packing a unique minifig in each set (similar to the rock monsters in Power Miners), and some of these ""evil"" minifigs are nice and in my opinion the only real attraction to these sets.

This set comes with two vehicles. One is based on the ""trike"" frame used in City sets. However, the policeman ""hangs"" on the handlebars, with no place to stand. Squidman's vehicle has a nice flame piece at the back, though I would have expected it to be TransBlue or so, this being a ""Freeze Ray"". Both vehicles rely heavily on stickers to give them some pzazz..

Finally, there is a traffic light and a stop sign....in space....????

Pro's;
- Nice minifigs, specially Squidman
- Good selection of parts

Con's;
- Bland, not very innovative or exciting given some of the other stuff TLG has done of late.
- Stickers
- 80 pcs for $ 10,-. That is $0.125 per piece; quite steep

This set does not measure up to some of the older Space sets imho...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2009-05-21T13:12:34.607Z","Awesome ten-buck Space set! ","I quite like this set. The vehicles are pretty well realized and it comes with some great figs. 


PROS: As usual, it comes with an awesome alien fig and a decent Space Police fig. Those alone might make the purchase for you; they're great, and very useful. The Police bike is great; it really feels like a flying bike, and I love it. The alien vehicle isn't as good, but it's still sufficient for what it is. Another cool detail is the stop sign and traffic light; not necessary, really, but they add something to the set. 

CONS: You've probably come to expect this, but the stickers are back in full force. The alien vessel, in particular, is coated with them. In general, the alien vehicle is relatively weak; it looks like a hunk of machinery and spray paint. I suppose that's what they were going for, but still, it's not as impressive as the other sets. Oh, and flick-fire missiles are present as well. 


Overall: This set is pretty good. If you don't mind stickers and want the aliens, this set is for you. If you're looking for a great alien vehicle though, look elsewhere (particularly at the Space Truck Getaway or Hyperspeed Pursuit).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Lets get down to it. The set is good, but could use some improvement. Kraxx's bike is decent, but relys way too much on stickers. The police bike is okay, but seems to high for the fig. I like the design on the police officer; but the jet-pack is kinda lame. 

Pros:

"rainstorm26","2009-05-23T21:40:18.467Z","Alien's awesome, police not so cool","I built this set today.  Kranxx is really cool.  The skull on his back and belt buckle are sweet.  The way he sits and hold the steering handle is also really awesome.  The flame is also really cool.  Much better than the Batman flame in the Mr. Freeze set.  His Space Bike is really awesome even without the stickers.

Police bike:  Not that great.  Police officer is not a double sided face like most of the space police officers.  The guy's mouth is too big.  The use of the old air tanks from 1970's kind of goofy.  I do like the helmets for the police.  The air intakes for the bike are nice.  The red and blue police lights are also good.  Flick fired missles never work well and in this arrangement are even worse.  The wheel attachments on the bike look bad.  The overall balance of the bike it pretty poor as it falls over easily. 

I also bought Squidman's escape.  I am thinking of building one big Police ship by combining the two.

The stop light and stop sign are stupid.  Why would the bikes flying through space need to stop at a stop light or stop sign on the ground.

In my opinion its another great starter set for Space Police with two great minifigures and alot of playability. Once again I'll use the PRO's and CON's system to review it.

PROS: 

Krannx: New alien minifigure. he is supposed to be some kind of futuristic biker gang leader. Very cool.

Police Officer: Very nice head, no double sided. He also comes with a black oxygen tank.

Krannx's Bike: I really like this bike, its built in two parts then connected in the middle. There are alot of stickers though...

Police Bike: Its ok, not my favorite. The white motorcycle chasis piece is nice.

The set also comes with a stop sign and street light, this adds to someextra playability.

CONS:

Police Bike isn't that great..

Police man doesn't have any weapons or handcuffs. (How is he supposed to apprehend the subject?)

Kranxx's bike is very well designed, as you can see in the picture. Even without the stickers on it, i find it gives the desired biker look.

The police bike is nice, but I found the design a little strange, as others have pointed out. It would have benefited greatly from small skis, much like the Star Wars Speeder bikes. So I added some white ones, and what do ya know, looks twice as good! I do love how well the flick-fire missiles work on the bike, no random rotation when trying to fire them.

"Loganwan","2009-06-23T15:42:56.247Z","Villains always have better vehicles than the Police","Unless you are a vigilante (Batman), the good guys never have as cool or strong vehicles as the bag guys.  There are any number of movies that back this.   And this set does not disappoint.

The alien is riding what is equivalent to a standard chopper.  it is big, long, and is more engine than anything.   The addition of a freeze ray and a bad looking biker gang member finish off this great vehicle.

Unfortunately, the police bike is not up to par.  It is a trike-bike turned backward with lots of spacy looking rounded parts added.  It looks like a first attempt at a custom job, not something that LEGO would actually produce as a set.
That being said, The rider is tough looking with his angry face, and the bike does have missiles, though with only two missiles, he is not a very formidable opponent without some other form of weaponry.

The added stop sign and stop light seem a little silly for a ""space"" set, but I guess they wanted to add a little something extra.  

This is a good set for another alien, cool space chopper and another police officer.  If only the police biker were cooler, but that is what customization is for.

"penguin999","2009-06-23T18:14:22.31Z","pretty cool set","   
     This set is a pretty cool set but it has some cons ......actually quite a bit. This set includes space bike leader Kranaxx and a space police. Kranaxx (who should be squid man) has a six pack (must be working out) with a leather vest with a skull on the back and on the belt buckle with a chain. He has tentacles or a flame for hair and has black eyes with white pupils. The police has the head of Dash from alpha team and a patterned bullet-prof vest with a black jet pack or oxygen tanks. He also has a helmet with visor.
   
     Kranaxx's speeder bike: This is the best part of the set. It's Krannaxx's prized possession.......His speeder bike. It has a weird seat but can still sit the same as any other seat. Anyway it has a long laser gun that can destroy a A-wing (from star wars). The steering wheel is really cool. In the front it has 2 spoiler pieces and in the middle it is a jet piece (which connects to the jet and seat part). By the big gun the panels that tell u the speed are there and a binocular piece is there too. In the back there is a BIG jet piece and the new flame piece which can fall off but it stay's on pretty good.

  The space police speeder: At first I thought it looked so weird but it surprised me soooo much. It has 2 freeze missiles and part of a 3 wheeler. It is OK but after a while it will get boring.

           Kranaxx

Space Police Bike

It's small, includes one minifigure with oxygen tank.  It also has a minifig handsized flickfire launcher on each side.  The main body of the bike is a white and gray trycicle/ motorbike chasis piece.  The minifig itself is nice, including an air tank like I said before, it also has a helmet and black helmet shield.

Kranxx's Bike.  It's bigger than the Space Policeman's bike but it's still small in its own way.  It has two sections that connect at the middle. Kranxx is cool and his entire body is new pieces!  He looks very tough.  One more thing!  Some people said that Kranxx's eyes were facing upwards and to the right but they're not!  The white circles are supposed to be the glare from a light reflecting off of his blck eyes!

The police bike thing is fine but not very special. But this is a great set if you concentrate on the 'hotrod', and borrow bits from the traffic light and the police bike to modify the black vehicle so it's the coolest in the galaxy.

"Tri_pod_king","2009-08-09T15:18:05.123Z","The return of Space Police!","    Space Police. The arrival of a long anticipated theme; return of a classic Lego Space theme. Back in the 80's and 90's, my older brother LOVED to play with Lego Space themes, one of his favorites being Space Police I and Space Police II. Well, with the end of Mars Mission, we get Space Police III.

      This set surprised me a little. It was not very disappointing. For your $9.99 you get Dash(see Alpha Team) as a Space Police officer and his small but nifty hover-bike with flick fire missiles, the space criminal Kranxx with his somewhat sleek, small-winged hover bike, a traffic light and a stop sign.

      This is a small set for $9.99, with minor flaws here and there, but I personally saw this set as a booster pack for pieces and minifigs. I'll tell you what I mean: my set is gone except for the stop sign and traffic light, but in its place are two vehicles that look EXTREMELY SIMILAR to the Hyperspeed Pursuit.

       What I'm trying to say is that if you have this set, you can take the pieces from this set and make them into something really cool.

       But time to consider the REAL vehicles themselves. The Space Police hover-bike is quite small, but crafty. Its weapons include two green flick-fire missiles, and the booster jet engine on the back, which can be detached to be used as the officer's blaster gun. The Space Police officer himself is very nice. He has printed legs and a double-sided printed torso. He has either an oxygen tank or a jet-pack on his back, and a nice but unoriginal helmet. Dash's head was a nice match for a police officer.

        Kranxx's hover-bike is nice, but kinda' stubby. It has small wings, and stickers! I actually think people should stop complaining about those annoying little stick things known as stickers. Lego's been putting stickers in their set for a long time, so we should be used to them now. GET OVER IT! Anyway, on the back is the new, oversized flame piece. It goes well on the back. Not much to the hover-bike. Kranxx himself is very nice. He has a double-printed 'vest' and  printed legs. His new head sculpt is very nice.

       In Conclusion: 4/5 Lego has been bringing back three past themes this year: Power Miners (From the 1999 theme Rock Raiders), Pirates, and Space Police. They've all brought promising sets. Freeze Ray Frenzy is not a bad set, with a few flaws here and there, but I recommend this set if you want to get a cool Space Police set without paying to much. Although I don't really get why it's called ''Freeze Ray Frenzy'', seeing as there is no Freeze Ray to Frenzy with!

 Officer- Nicely printed front and back body and printed legs. He comes with an oxygen tank but i'm not quite sure if it is in fact supposed to be an oxygen tank or a jetpack.

Kranxx' Hotrod Hover-Cycle- Cool but  too many stickers which can be either bad or good depending on your opinion. The look and design is simple yet very nice looking. I also like the new flame piece added to the Space Police theme. The vehicle looks alot smaller than i expected. maybe my eyes are going bad but it looked bigger on the lego shop website.

Officer's Speeder Bike or Whatever- Cool looking and I have no complaints with this part. Or the whole set for that matter.

(Long Review Approaching)

The Police Officer:
Nothing too special. His head is the same as the Dropship Pilot in the MX-71 Dropship of Mars Mission. Unfortunately, it is not double sided but has airtanks (unlike Squidman's Escape, 5969).

The Police Vehicle:
Nothing too special either, except for: a) the flick fire holders can be held by minifigs; b) It is based on a trike base turned around.
I have read some reviews that say he has nothing to stand on. That is not entirely true, as the 'seat' that is usually used for the trike can also be used here. The police's legs must be bent backwards to fit properly. The Vehicle is self supporting and can stand upright. One problem is, however, what will the Police do if both his rockets miss the criminal???

Kranxx:
To me, Kranxx and hhis hover-bike are the main attractions in this set. Kranxx's head is made of plastic, not rubber. The hole that represents his mouth goes all the way through to the neck hole allowing you to see the 'neck' that holds the head.

Kranxx's Bike
Kranxx's bike is built obeying the general 'rule' for most alien vehicles. This rule seems to be: 'Have two wings at the front pointing forwards, and have two wings at the back pointing backwards.' It uses a neew flame piece at the back to simulate the 'flame trail' described on the Lego Shop. The gun on the front is very simple but seems out of place because of the way it is attached. For those who put stickers on their models, the red line is on the right wings. The seat is unusual but works.

Pros:
New flame piece
Kranxx
Launchers for flick-fire missiles don't randomly swivel
Kranxx's bike can be thrown on rocks and still retain some of its shape
Seat on Kranxx's bike works well
Police can 'sit' in bike
Free Stop sign and Traffic light

Cons:
Police is hard to put in 'seat'
flame piece sometimes (but not often) falls out
gun on Kranxx's bike seems out of place

Verdict: A good addition to any Space Police collection. Also good if you like futuristic cities but need traffic lights and stop signs.

"Kalhiki","2009-10-05T18:50:55.357Z","My first Space Police set","And I am very happy about it. In this review I'll start with the small and go up to the large.
1. The smallest thing in this set is the stopsign. It is a great addition to this set. It also, along with the stoplight, is great to play with the set. Now you can have a reason to arrest Kranxx (running a stoplight). The word ""stop"" is written in a futuristic-spacey text. The only problem I have is that it's a sticker, so make sure you have it on straight.
2. The stoplight is well-crafted for being an accessory. Not much to say accept that it looks like a stoplight.
3. I'll do the police man first even though he has more pieces than Kranxx. Once again, not much to say, except he doesn't look like a stoplight. The pants and shirt are very detailed with the badge in the center of the shirt. He's got the air tanks on his back, and a helmet with a visor. His face looks angry (must not have gotten his coffee this morning) and has some sunglasses. He also has a microphone head-set.
4. Kranxx, the mean orange monster. His pants have knee pads, a chain and two pointed shapes. Those are the fangs for the skull on his belt. He has a sleeveless, unzipped jacket showing off his muscles. he also has a skull insignia on the front and back of the jacket. He's got a very scary head with weird tentacle-looking things on his head which appears to be hair. He's got fangs and beady black eyes.
Onto the vehicles!
5. The Space Police vehicle is very strange. It is pretty much all one part. There isn't much to say. It's overall appearance is bad, but it works. It has flick fire missiles, lights, and an engine.
6.The largest part is the bike. It's very threatening looking with the scratches and bullet holes on the wings. Not to mention the skull on the engine. But there is something that looks bad. On two of the wings there is a streak of red. I think Kranxx may have his something living. It has two small guns and one big gun at the front. It also has a monitor screen and steering handles. There isn't much to say at the back section. One of the wings has stylized writing that looks like it says Kranxx, but I can't make it out. Finally there is the fire trail made of the new flame piece. I advise to leave that on because it looks weird without it.
Overall a very nice set despite the price. I recommend you picking it up if you find it.

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2009-10-29T00:49:47.67Z","Great set for a decent price","I remember that I got this set the same day I bought Squidman's Pitstop, and is part of the reason why I got into Space Police III. I saw the article about Squidman's Pitstop in a lego catalog and I for some reason wanted it. I went down to a nearby Lego store to buy it. I saw that there was only one more set of Freeze Ray Frenzy so I grabbed it and thought it might be a good addition to the pitstop.

This set is truly a good one. Lots of pros and only minor cons. 

PROS
Both vehicles are very well designed and have a futuristic, sleak and stylish look. I will admit I was suspicious of what I might think of the Ray Bike (that's what the police vehicle is called if I'm correct) because of the odd use of a trike chassis. Fortunately, the geniuses down at LEGO perfected the design and gave it a look that it would otherwise not have had if that piece weren't used. Kranxx's hotrod cycle is sweet too. I boasts a common feature in Black Hole gang ships; four wings on the ship. This gives it a good uniform type of look when compared to other gangster ships. Its design is also very convincing that the thing is wicked fast and a truly thuggish machine; perfect. 

The minifigs are excellent, as they always are IMO in Space Police III. The police officers are great figures, but to me, they always feel COMPLETE when a black airtank piece is on them, which in this set it is. Kranxx is a great figure, with a well designed head that gives him a fearsome look.

CONS
The only con I can think of for this set is the price. I remember back in the day a set like this might be 5 bucks, half of this set's price. Still, back in the day, there wasn't that immense a variety of pieces, and the minifigures weren't nearly as good as they are in Space Police III. So the price isn't even a con, technically.

Though this is a lengthy review for a small set, I feel that it deserves one because LEGO did an excellent job with this set. I would recommend it to any LEGO fan out there! 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Also, the Space Policeman's bike has 2 flick fire missiles.

First of all it has a stop sign witch I didn't expect, secondly it has a traffic light, and it has 2 speeder bikes. Kranxx's speeder has 2 segments which is odd but even more so because he sits on 1 and his controls are on the other. Other than that his bike is cool, it has a laser, a flame, and wings. the Space Police vehicle on the other hand is even stranger, it has pegs for wheels but no wheels, and it has an empty socket  which seems to have no purpose. All that's cool on the police speeder are the flick fire missles (which work). That is about all I have to say so now onto the Cool/Not Cool features of this set.

"Boidoh","2010-12-24T19:16:32.053Z","Freeze, Your Under Arrest!","<p>I got this set as an early christmas present. It is a very nice set and has got me in to the Space Police III theme recently even though im more of a city theme dude. Also is it just me or are LEGO overdoing the amount&nbsp;of flick-fire weapons? Atleast this one sticks in it. Ok onto the review.</p>
<p><strong>The Building</strong></p>
<p>The building of this set is very simple and great. The younger children can build this in about 5-10 minutes. The children from about 10-17 can build this in about 5-7 minutes. The adults 18-45 could build this is a good 4-6 minutes although 46-99 makes it much slower as they are more elderly and makes it more harder to build LEGO's. I built this in about 5 or 6 minutes and it was an interesting build from the Stop Sign to the Hot Rod. This is a great set to get someone into building the Space Police III Theme.</p>
<p><strong>The Parts</strong></p>
<p>The parts are great. Comes with a good looking flame which goes great with the Titanium Command Rig to replace the little small flames. The Stop Sign and Traffic Light can be great to go in your city even though they are a bit small. This set also comes with some neat looking handle bars. The minifigure accessorys include a neat looking helmet and an air tank. The head of the minifigure Kranxx is a great new look for this member of the Black Hole Gang.</p>
<p><strong>Playablity</strong></p>
<p>This set comes with everything you can play with for hours and hours. With 2 ships and 2 street accessorys the possibilitys are endless, from flying down into a city and crashing to stealing a couple street sign a child could play with these for hours as i mentioned. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This set is a great set for any LEGO Fan. From the great looking flame to the 2 vehicles this set is great and i got it at a great price too. I recomend this set to any and everyone.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

The entire Space Police 3 Sub-Theme has been really fun, I just wish I could finish collecting it before it vanishes from stores.</p>

<p>On to the review. This set offers up something that most of the other cheap sets don't, two vehicles for both Mini-Figures. For the Space Police Officer there is a miniature hover-cycle (or something) and Kranx is given the larger vehicle, a souped up Space Hog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Space Police Officer's Vehicle is fairly ingenious as far as builds go - it uses motorcycle parts in a fancy unique new way that I found to be quite impressive looking. (From an engineer stand point.) Kranx's vehicle is basically a rocket with 'tude and it really looks cool next to other vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figures are a nice pair of mini-figures for your collection. The Space Police Officer is fun and unique... Kranx is even more unique, his head design is something I really think LEGO has improved upon since the early days. One of the truly fun things about this set is that it includes a traffic light and stop sign, prooving that Kranx is really disobeying the traffic laws. There are also stickers being used for details. I don't mind the stickers, but some Lego Fans may not appreciate it.</p>
