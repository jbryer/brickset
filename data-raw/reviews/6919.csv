"dragon_teenager","2009-05-21T13:06:53.577Z","Not as good as it looks, but still decent. ","This was one of the most promising SP3 sets this year. It's still very nice, but unfortunately it has some flaws that are easy to miss in the box art. 


PROS: Most obviously, it looks very cool. It's very swooshable and awesome for display. It has two movable rear thrusters that look great and make the whole vehicle seem like a hovercraft, which I don't mind at all. Additionally, it comes with two awesome figs: Frenzy and a Space Police trooper. Frenzy is awesome, because his head is epic. His printed body isn't amazing but the four-armed head piece more than makes up for it. The Space Police fig is great too, though not quite as remarkable. 

CONS: You may have already noticed, but the cockpit is actually very empty. And when I say empty, I mean that it's functioning more like a flying suit of armor. The pilot has next to no protection. My theory is that it's actually a land-based hover cargo transport. 

Unfortunately the flaws don't end there. You see those wings attached to the engines in front? They swivel. That's right, they flip around like clunky propellers. I can't understand why for the life of me; it's easy enough to fix. Heck, I thought of a million ways to mod it out. It doesn't add anything to the play experience and often just gets in the way. Why, LEGO? 


Overall: Don't get the wrong impression; overall, I am actually quite pleased with this set. Again, it's a great display model, and comes with two great figs. It's pretty fun to play with too. Just be prepared to forgive some incredibly sloppy construction techniques before you buy it.

Great looking ship--really like no LEGO ship I've ever seen. The blunt front end with the skinny windscreen is a cool design. It looks very aggressive and very...police-y.

It does look a little better on the box than in reality. It is longer and skinnier than you expect it to be. It is also very wobbly. EVERYTHING on the set is connected with single Technic resistance pins. So everything, the fins, wings, engines are VERY loosey-goosey. The swoosh factor would be higher if everything was a little more stable.

I will say this though, the cockpit opening system is SWEET. The whole front end swings down, and the roof panel slides back smoothly. It's like something from  Anime--very cool. This mechanism seems like an apology for all the recent, ""Just rip the window off"" cockpits.

""Frenzy"" the four armed alien is fantastic. I'm sure I'll end up buying a lot of SP3 just for the aliens.

The Space Police themselves though, have to be the dullest characters ever made. How about a trans-red visor? Or the new Agents armor, something to make them stand out? Right now they are about as exciting as, say, those mechanics with the tan baseball caps who come with the X-wing set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This being my first Space Police set I thought it was pretty awsome. The officer guy was a little dull but he had a nice teenage face (cadet in training?). but most of all I want to talk about the alien Frenzy, His head is actually his first set of arms CONNECTED to the head. I like the color green on him its pretty good on him. 
 
   The speeder was a little dull, the should have put maybe some blasters atleast. The spaceship is alright but its mostly technic like another review said. The biggest flaw is that I dont get how to keep the gold safe in place!. But the BIGGEST flaw is that its pretty empty on back. They couldve but maybe a cage to protect it!

"jkool","2009-09-17T18:33:55.187Z","Gold Heist - Good style, but sloppy design","Like many others, I waited for Space Police 3 with excitement! I grew up with SP1 and SP2, so I was very happy to see the return of the SP line. I'm not entirely satisfied with the sets released so far, but that's only because my expectations are so high. 

The main problem with this set is that neither vehicle is really fleshed out. I would have much rather seen them bulk up the Police ship a little more and forget about the little alien craft which is really poor. 

Specifically, improvements I would've liked to see would be a little more support so the engines in the front didn't just wobble around. I don't mind the top ""hovercraft"" style engines swiveling, but the front ones need to be fixed to give the craft more stability. 

The cockpit just seems half finished on the police ship, and I wish they had built it up a little more on the sides. The way the cockpit swivels open on the top and front is a very nice design, but there is nothing to lock it in place and it comes open very easily. Minus 1 point.

The price point is fair, just over 200 pieces for $19.99 should be easy to swallow for any LEGO lover. 

As an aesthetic complaint, I feel that this is not really a ""Space Police"" ship, but more of an armored money carrier more suited to a futuristic city theme. This would normally be OK, but this is Space POLICE, and for that I have to take off a point.

The tiny blue window is almost too small to be useful. I would've liked to see a slightly bigger window, but to be fair, it fits here as a small window on an armored transport vehicle. The only problem with this being an armored transport vehicle is there is no armor! Minus 1 point.

"Ovid07","2009-06-30T14:31:35.247Z","Not the Best, But Still Good","Intro:
This is a very exciting time for me...in terms of Lego sets.  The other day I recently got the summer 2009 catalog and was very impressed with the Space Police cover.  Being a large space fan, I think it's great that the Space Police 3 launch is finally in full swing (with the exception of that blasted Space Police Lego website)!

First Impressions:
When I  saw pictures of this set on the internet a few months ago, I wasn't quite sure if I was going to get it.  Sure it had nice minifigs, a few gold bars, and a cool vehicle, but at that point I was more focused on the largest Space Police set, the Galactic Enforcer.  But, a few months latter when Legoshop released the first four SP3 sets I decided to order this and sets 5969 and 5970 while I waited for the Galactic Enforcer to be released.  To say the least, I was happily surprised with Gold Heist when it came.

The Minifigs:
The Officer: As I mentioned in my review of 5969, I don't really have too much to say about the space police officers.
Frenzy: Despite what people say, Frenzy is probably my least favorite SP3 villain.  The real reason for this is that the body extension piece that goes on his neck makes him look to tall, and the droid arms don't seem to match up with his other two arms.  In other words, he looks...unpolished.  Perhaps I would be happier if Lego just made a whole new torso piece that could hold four regular arms.

The Intergalactic Armored Truck:
Design: At first, I was kind of disappointed with this vehicle, because as others have mentioned it looks kind of odd from the side. Recently, however, it has grown on me.  I don't know what has changed but for some reason I have come to appreciate it more.  This vehicle is unique and different and, in many cases, that's what can make a Lego set great.
Functionality:  The way the cockpit opens is just amazing, and the detachment of the gold safe is also great.  Despite what the common consensus seems to be between other reviews, my set hasn't fallen apart at all really.

Frenzy's Speeder
As a little throw in this is a nice addition to the set.  The only thing I don't like is the piece on the back which is to tow the safe.  Do you really think a Space Police Officer would let Frenzy stop, get off his speeder, release the safe from the armored vehicle, hook it up to his, and then drive away?

Stickers:
Should I say more? :(

Overall:
For 20.00 (USD) this is a great start or addition to any Space Police 3 Collection.

"ankhofmishra","2009-06-12T11:37:00.31Z","A strong return to Space Police","Ok I cave, I'm finally going to review a set

I'm a long-time fan of Space Police II (too young for SP1), so I felt a great need to get the new SP sets. Lego has evolved a lot since 1990, but I'm not disappointed by these sets.

Long gone are the linear color schemes of Space, this set actually reminds me of the styling of the Exploreans. I think this set will be more appreciated by those who want lots of realistically moving parts. The moving engines are realistic to me, but become cumbersome and flimsy. Personally, this is how I'd build it, regardless of stability, so I'm all for it.

I love the design of the ship, even if the cockpit is wide open on the sides (it is, afterall, a cargo carrier). The way the cockpit opens is pretty awesome, even if it's not so practical. I really dislike the stickers, not sure why Lego insists on pouring them into every new set. However, I like the control panel here.

As mentioned, the flick-fire missile arms are very flimsy, but I never use them anyway.

One strange feature is the SP officer's helmet. It's very cool looking, but doesn't provide any protection from space (it's completely open on the bottom)

Overall, i'd have to highly recommend this set for those Space fans.
I can't wait to get the Galactic Enforcer and pair it next to my Galactic Mediator :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2009-07-03T00:09:41.84Z","It's a Start...","I must admit, I don't see why everyone is making such a fuss over this set. It certainly is smaller than I expected (much smaller) as the part count is somewhat spent on detail. Most of the flaws in the set can actually be fixed with spare parts already included. Where the set loses in size, it is a pioneer, being the first space set with a four armed minifigure (yay!)

The mini speeder is pitifully small, especially since it is expected to haul a gold safe too (if it takes a hovercraft to tow it, then how can Frenzy?).

The main ship is pretty small, but is very detailed and certainly looks heavily armed, (minus the flick fire missiles). Unfortunately, this view hides some problems. The cockpit is empty and its sides are open, plus the tail is much thinner than it appears, but the over-exaggerated engines are a bonus.

I particularly love how the cockpit opens, front and top.

Now for a bit of advice. The set includes a lot of spare parts, a few of which can be put to good use. The extra 1x1 30 degree slopes (one in t-red and one in t-blue) can be placed behind the missile launcher (right behind the two small, white curved slopes) on the corresponding sides. The extra 1/2 bush can be used to steady the safe on the back, and the spare handcuffs are especially useful for capturing Frenzy. After all, how can you apprehend a monster with four arms if you only have one pair of handcuffs...

Pros:
-Sturdy
-Detailed vehicle and torsos, stickers aren't as bad as they used to be
-Well armed and plenty of playability. Can be easily rebuilt.
-Cool engines (they don't slip as much as people say)
-Frenzy with FOUR ARMS!
-Decent accessories
-Very playable

Cons:
-Empty cockpit with big holes
-Too many stickers
-Fins on engines not evenly spaced + does not rotate down well due to safe
-Safe wobbles unless steadied with spare bush
-Tiny speeder
-Flick fire missiles work terribly

minifigs + tools:
stats:
 - 2 - frenzy & police
 - frenzy is unique to this set
 - handcuffs
 - gold
This set is the only set to contain frenzy (so far) and he isn't a disappointment. His eyes make him look like he's crazy, and he uses a standard body, with only a customised head piece. The handcuffs that come with the set are perfeect. They fit minifig arms well and can be linked together for a minifig criminal chain. Unfortunately, the Police Officer isn't quite up to standard. He lacks an airtank and his head is common within Mars Mission sets.

pros:
 - frenzy - the first minifig with 4 arms using basic minifig legs and torso
 - frenzy's upper body rotates
 - frenzy's lower body works just like a normal minifig
 - handcuffs fit
 - gold looks like gold
cons:
 - police officer lacks airtanks
 - police officer's head is common

'hyper hopper' - frenzy's plate with jets:
stats:
 - 14 pieces only
 - handlebars
 - essentially a plate with a handlebar piece and jets
A massive disappointment, but since Frenzy is quite tall, it would be hard to fit him in an enclosed vehicle. It clips to the vault, but the clip thing often swings around violently with the vault attached.

pros:
 - fits frenzy on
 - handlebars can be used for many other things
 - flame pieces can be used for many things as well
cons:
 - very, very small
 - how could someone actually sit on it and not fall off in real life?
 - leaves frenzy very vulnerable to freeze rays

vault:
stats:
 - clips into space freighter and hyper hopper
 - holds gold
A simple construction, yet brilliantly designed and very tough. It holds the gold with plenty of room to spare; perfect for the two handcuffs (one is a spare part).

pros:
 - sturdy
 - lots of space
cons:
 - none, really

XL Space Freighter:
stats:
 - swivel jets
 - freeze ray guns (flick fire)
 - opening cockpit
 - hold and drops vault
This is the main feature of the set. It has two swivelling engines and two swivelling engines with wings and guns. This can get annoying without blutack (random note: blutack = the solution to everything and anything..except food and water). The cockpit isn't enclosed, but this allows for some brilliant cockpit engineering, in which the roof folds back and the front folds forward. Shame about the controls though, 'cos it's just a sticker. There are a lot of stickers in the set, but I've seen more. The vault is held in place by a technic beam and the two upside down cones on the top of the vault.

pros:
 - great cockpit!
 - swivelling rear engines - looks like a hover craft
 - the cheapest SPIII set to have guns (not flick fire missiles, guns)
 - fairly sturdy
cons:
 - front engines swivel - that can be fixed by...BLUTACK (or craft glue/superglue/rubber glue/etc
 - cockpit isn't enclosed - to allow for the opening cockpit
 - from the back it looks very flimsy
 - vault sometimes refusees to fall off

Some police guy and Frenzy.<br>Police guy- He has the basic body and legs, so not really going to go into that. His face has some stubble and floppy hair. This face makes him appear to be younger and&nbsp;one of the new recruits. And of course he has the helmet and visor. He also carries handcuffs, but sadly there isn't a gun to speak of. Also, if he's chasing a guy with four arms shouldn't he have two pairs? Yay for extra parts!<br>Frenzy- This guy is cool. His legs are basic green with no printing. His body, however is very wrinkly looking and on his back you can see shoulder blades and his spine under his skin. This gives him the appearance of a thin&nbsp;fleshy lizard. I like the fact that they added an extra pair of arms to&nbsp;give him more personality. His head is also&nbsp;cool. He has a pair of crazy buggy eyes. I also like his mouth.

It's a seat with&nbsp;handles and two jets of fire shooting out the back.&nbsp;There's also a connector to hold the safe.<br>I guess you could call the safe an accessory. It's a yellow box that&nbsp;holds the gold. In my opinion, it's a pretty heavy duty safe to be holding only two bars of gold. It holds onto the ship via a locking system. Push in a plus rod and swing down a thingamabob to prevent the rod from coming out. It's a nice contraption, and the safe holds in well.<br>The ship itself... Like I said it had potential. I'll&nbsp;just cover the&nbsp;whole thing. From the back, I already covered the locking mechanism. There are also a pair of swiveling engines. I like the design, but they are annoyinging. The whole concept of them swiveling makes it seem like it's more of a hovering, ground based vehicle. My first problem with this set is that the engines are floppy and hard to keep even. <br>Next up is the cockpit.&nbsp;It's&nbsp;awful.&nbsp;It lifts up at two points which is nice. Everything stays in one piece and you don't have to remove the top of the vehicle to get the driver out. But&nbsp;the cockpit also makes it seem like it's&nbsp;a ground based vehicle. It's very open with no doors, so without a helmet, you really couldn't fly this in outer space.<br>Finally the front which is probably the best part. If I remember correctly,&nbsp;the engines&nbsp;doen't swivle, but part of me says&nbsp;they do. *goes off to check* Nevermind, it sadly swivels. Why? Why do they have to make unneccesary moves like that. It'd&nbsp;be better if it was immobile. The engines are once again cool looking. I also like the forward swept wings and laser cannons. There are also flick fire missles on each side. I guess you could take those off and let the officer have one as a gun. I also like the grill design on the front.<br>Size-wise, 20 bucks isn't all that bad. But when you factor in the swiveling junk, it marks it down. 15 dollars is the most I'd pay for this. Overall, it's an O.K. set. I'd reccommend many other sets above this. However, if you're going to set it on a shelf for display, it's good. But playing with it may raise some problems.

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2009-12-30T21:47:56.153Z","It certainly doesn't look bad in the picture...","This set is, quite simply, to me, an outright disappointment to the quality of set design I have typically experienced in SPIII. Why? Here are the PROS and CONS.

PROS
To make this review complete, I must, perhaps for the fifth or sixth time, state how much I love the SPIII minifigures. The Space Police Officers are just so futuristic looking and convincing. And the criminals! How I love the criminals! This set comes with the very uncommon FRENZY! He is one of few four-armed minifigs out there, and boy does he look great! Frenzy is reason enough to buy this set, IMO. Also, despite the inevitable CONS of this set, it does, admittedly, look very impressive for a machine of its kind. You might even be able to compare it to one of those Separatist hover-tanks from Star Wars!

CONS
Its difficult to envision the ""XL SpaceFreighter"" (I believe that's the machine's name.) floating through the void of space, carrying whatever it is carrying, because it is without a doubt, not airtight. There are plenty of people out there, I'd wager who are nit-picky about that in LEGO spacecraft, as I am. If it's just a speeder, I don't mind. But if it's something as big as this machine, then I just want to see it fully encase the pilot! Another thing is the SpaceFreighter's roofing; it cannot secure itself in place; that is, if you tipped the vehicle upside down, the roofing would fly open. Also, the jet engines on this ship are on an axis. That in itself is fine, and would allow the ship to possibly maneuver better (perhaps that's what LEGO had in mind.) but with this ship, it is just so loose and such a hassle to play with and position, or attempt to position! Sadly, I must also criticize the flick-rocket system. Usually I am quite content with the flick-missiles, though people dislike them because they feel they are gimmicky (which I think they are as well, I just don't MIND them, is all). But in this set, the idea of ""flicking"" the rocket, well, it would completely tear off the firing mechanism from the ship because its so poorly built. Sadly, I don't like Frenzy's Hyper-Hopper, not over the fact that one could consider it gimmicky and poor, but because the back rod on the ship is quite loose. I just don't like it! I must mention that I would LIKE the Hyper-Hopper if it DIDN'T have that cheesy little tow thing at the back.

I just don't like this set's anatomy. The main feature of this set, although good LOOKING, is just a piece of garbage, IMO. Flimsy, non-airtight, poorly built overall. Essentially, if I were an officer of the Space Police, I would plead not to be assigned to fly this scrap pile!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

With all these different and rare parts, the only set with the space crook, Frenzy, and flick-fire missiles! The details are AMAZING in this set. This has some of the most awesome functions! A lot of this stuff you can roll around 360! I only have one problem: Frenzy's Speeder. How is a criminal supposed to escape in THAT speeder? It can't even fire lasers! This set has some fairly rare parts AND, some awesome minifigures!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Awesome size for a $20 set!</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is in a box that can be a little deceptive. It is not as large as the box would indicate, and buying it full price is defnitely a hit or miss decision. On the one hand I don't think it's so bad even at full price, but others might feel as if they are being cheated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transporting a shipment of Space Gold is one Space Police Officer in his strange and quirky designed vehicle (I liken it to the armored car of space.), the ship uses stickers for some things, namely showing off that this is a POLICE vehicle. It is armed with flick-fire missiles, something that I feel is an interesting addition for play, and makes for a nice display as well. The safe is small, but with only two gold bricks (gold colored plates) it can be forgiven, also if it were any larger our alien thief would have a hard time getting away with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's be honest here though, LEGO has decided that the criminal (his name escapes me at the moment.) can get away with stealing the gold on a small, one-person hover vehicle. We're talking something that is akin to the hoverboards in Back to the Future. For the size that they stuck this set in they could have easily given us a few more pieces to make something as impressive or at least large enough as Kranx's Space Hog in Freeze Ray Frenzy. It's a crying shame all the unused potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>True Moders/Mocers can easily modify the vessel with existing parts, probably beef it up a little, but for kids some of them might prefer to have two larger vehicles, especially at the price LEGO is asking for this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A nice bonus however is the inclusion of two pairs of LEGO handcuffs, I really like them and they make it easy for the Police Officer to arrest the thief. (Why can't I remember his name?) I would still recommend this set though to any Space enthusiasts or anyone who is just looking for new/unique Mini-Figures to add to their collection, especially if you can find it on sale.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
