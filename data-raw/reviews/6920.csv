The cop is great, but only if he came with a speeder. Now for the cown on the king, the space truck, you have a little room to play inside the crate, goes with any space set greatly, and it's color goes good with snake. FRAGILE! 9/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2009-07-02T23:37:52.513Z","Mutha' Trucker of the Future","I can't give this set a 5 star rating on account of a few minor flaws in the set, but that is expected from a theme that hasn't seen a decent spotlight since LoM (or Mars Mission if your a fan). I honestly love the new approach of putting faces to the bad guys rather than a shadowy cult of villains who all look exactly the same (ex: Blacktron, Spyrius, etc.). But now there is a broad spectrum of faces adding personality to the series; Snake is no exception.

The set consists of a large truck with an attached trailer/crate. There is, as you can see, no vehicle for the Space Police officer, making him rather left out when he's not clinging on for his dear life. I would appreciate anything to add to this set for him, even a skateboard.

Also, aside from his (pathetic) rocket launcher, there are no accessories for anyone unless you count the laser cannon in the back. The one rocker launcher in pretty sad though. It is very hard to shoot without moving it, and impossible to shoot very far without hurting yourself. I don't see a future for the flick firing unless there are major improvements...

As for the truck, it is very intimidating and screams anything but poser, it IS for real. Even through the most critical eye, it is very sturdily built, even though its bottom is just framework, there is nothing to complain about. On top of that, the ship is very intricately designed with plenty of detail. The exhaust pipes don't stay still, but a few changes in the framework can keep them in place if it bothers you.

The container may be a problem. It is composed entirely of bulky parts, the best of which are covered in stickers, meaning they look awkward apart. The two doors also don't close right all of the time, but the articulation of the laser cannon makes up for that. With heavy modifications, the container can be removed and closed up on the bottom so that it can be easily taken on and off without hurting the laser inside, but it probably isn't worth the trouble.

To sum it up:
Pros:
-Awesome truck with spikes and all
-Detailed minifigures with double sided torsos, detailed legs, and a skullcap that looks really cool
-Aesthetically pleasing in every way
-Great playability
-Cool and articulate laser
-The stickers are incredibly detailed and are made well, the container comes to life with rips, scratches, graffiti, skulls, and my favorite, the word ""Blacktron"".

Cons:
-Terrible flick fire missiles
-Too many stickers
-No vehicle for the police officer
-Bulky container that doesn't stay shut
-Moving exhaust pipes
-Pricey set for not enough parts. A speeder for the officer would help.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"18000pieces","2009-08-14T12:04:14.687Z","The biggest, baddest, bad ship in the theme!","The current line-up for space police includes very few large baddie ships. This one is the biggest and the best. It has a surprisingly large wingspan, about a foot, and the cargo box is large, but it doesn't overwhelm the set.

PROS:
-Snake is a great fig, even if he is overused.
-The truck looks great and has an assortment of useful pieces, including five large engine pieces, the low-down windshield piece in trans-gray, and some great greebling pieces.
-The large flame piece is awesome.
-The set focused more on design than on cheesy gimmicks (the ship doesn't have ANY flick-fire missles. Hallelujah!)
-The stickers are mostly large enough that applying them isn't a pain.
-The stickers look great and have lots of little easter eggs to try to find.
-The opening container and laser articulation are perfect.
-The build is always interesting and not repetetive for very long.
-High swooshability.

CONS:
-The space police man is blah. He's dull bley and has a generic decal, and his air tanks make it impossible for him to do anything like sit down. His visor keeps falling off, and his weapon is lousy.
-The container part doesn't have a floor, and the entire ship, is, in fact, full of holes. When the container bay is open, it is possible to look in at a hole in the front of the ship and see through the back.
-Snake can't sit up, and the cockpit is altogether bland. And you can put him back into it without taking of the windshield.
-Snake has no weapon.
-The space police man has no ship, although it's almost better that way - a lousy twenty-piece sloop would have ruined the asthetic.
-The containers fall open when in flight unless secured.
-The yellow sides of the containers are kind of POOP-y unless you're building something else large, rectangular, and yellow with grafiti on it.

It may seem like a lot of cons, but they're more nitpicky. The set is awesome overall, and one of the most detailed non-liscensed sets in recent memory. And, even moreso that with most legos, the possiblities for modification are endless. Put in a floor, take out the laser, and who knows what could fit in that back part? A base of operations? A fast food restaurant? A smaller spaceship? Great fun and well worth the money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"MayTheBricksBeWithYou","2009-07-04T05:26:05.013Z","LEGO Space Truckers with a little surprise","Got this set from S@H yesterday together with Hyperspeed Pursuit and started with this one.

First thing I noticed was the huge box. A box filled with.. air! Cause you don't need such a big box for those 282 parts. Apparently LEGO wanted to compensate for something. Maybe indeed for the big holes in the underside of the finished ship. 

But that flaw aside, I really like it. The general appearance of it is really of a big bad mother trucker with some heavy cargo. But wait, the container opens and there is an evenly big Police laser!

I must say that I was (positively) surprised with the solid looks with only 282 parts. The truck part looks big and bulky, just as you would expect from a space truck. The bag that contained that truck part was so empty, I really thought LEGO had made an error and gave me not enough parts. 

The instructions erroneously mentions to empty bag 1 again when you actually need to empty the number 2 bags. But the rest of the instructions are good to follow, aimed at a younger audience. 

The figs are nothing new if you have the 2 impulses. You only get a two sided head and a new weapon for your police fig. 

A nice extra vehicle for the police fig would have been a nice bonus. So with that and the holes in the bottom design I deduct 1 star from the rating and give it a 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Cyborg_Phloyd","2009-12-23T18:15:04.123Z","Another Mighty Ship of the Black Hole Gang","Here is yet another one of my rather lengthy Space Police III reviews, going into broad detail of the sets I own. This time I give my opinion on the Container Heist set, and chiefly the ""Wrecker"" Space Truck. 

PROS
The very first pro in every one of my SPIII reviews are the Minifigures. THey are so enjoyable and cool-looking. The one thing I hate about Space Police officers is there occasional lack of Black Airtanks. Obviously though, this set includes black airtanks and I love it! Snake is one of my favorite criminals of SPIII. Though he is a little TOO common in the series, he's such a sweet criminal that I gotta love getting him in any set I find him in. Next pro is the set's overall look. When you have finished building it, you will have a set that, IMO turned out even larger than expected! With four massive space thruster engines and the Black Hole Gang's ""signature"" design of four wings on their ships, the thing is clearly wicked-fast. It also must be one of the toughest and most destructive vehicles in the Black Hole Gang's fleet, hence the name ""Wrecker."" Look at the spikes at the front! The front of the Wrecker is heavily armored, and equipped with two very big laser weapons. Also, the design of the large yellow crate at the back is not only quite believable, but there is graffiti on it that makes it look as though it has been in Gang possession for a long time, not to mention the iconic ""Blacktron"" graffiti on one of the sides! The hidden Space Police laser is also a great model, looking like a truly powerful weapon; and a danger in the hands of the Black Hole Gang.

CONS
I must say that this set did disappoint me in some regards. First off, I sort of wish that the Space Police Officer had something more than just a handheld flick-fire launcher (not that I have a problem with those as some people do). A mini-speeder or little ship might've been nice. But then again, with no little ship, it does prevent the possibility of the set coming with a poorly designed, gimmicky ship (like the HORRIBLE ship included in the ""Max Security Transport"" set!) The next thing I didn't like about this set is the cockpit design of the Wrecker. First off, in order to put Snake in and out of the cockpit, you will likely need to do a bit of dissassembling to seat him and get him out. Fortunately the roof comes off fairly easily. I did some experimentation with the set, seeing what it might look like if the Wrecker wasn't carrying a crate. And frankly, it doesn't look good. I don't mind the emptiness in the back without the crate, but it's the cockpit I hate! Without the crate, the back of the cockpit has a massive gaping hole. Now, I don't doubt for a moment that Snake could breathe in space without oxygen, but with a hole in the BACK, he'd be sucked right out! Essentially, LEGO just used the massive crate as a back wall. Many people have praised the fact that the Space Police laser cannon can pivot on its axis within the crate and turn 360 degrees. Well, I partially praise that. I like that the laser can move with the axis its on, but the turntable used to make the laser turn around is much too loose! Then again, it might've been difficult to do that trick any other way...

Don't let the cons I gave this set fool you. I truly enjoyed ""Container Heist,"" both in building it and playing around with it. The figures, as I've mentioned are great and the ship, despite its imperfections is still quite a piece of work. I feel bad for the Space Police Officers that have to try and stop this bad-boy! 4/5!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2010-03-05T07:53:40.42Z","Quite frankly one of the ugliest Space sets ever made.","<p>This set is apparently meant to be a spacecraft used by villainous aliens.&nbsp; It looks more like a Batmobile/Knight Rider car carrying a large yellow crate.</p>
<p>I've already complained about the space police minifigs and their improbable-looking helmets which don't protect them from the vacuum of space, so I don't suppose there's any point in mentioning them again.&nbsp; But the spacecraft looks like a combination of two sets which don't even belong in the same theme, let alone the same range.</p>
<p>The yellow 'crate' contains a hidden space police gun, presumably stolen.&nbsp; It isn't very well hidden, seeing as there's nothing to hold the two halves of the container in place and it keeps coming open.&nbsp; Not only that, but the container is made of those useless pre-fabricated wall pieces.</p>

"Kalhiki","2010-03-05T22:06:32Z","Menacing, Evil, but Fragile","<p>By far, my favorite Space Police set. The overall look is evil, but the yellow crate is a little gaudy. I'm also dissapointed that the Police Officer didn't get his own space craft (even something very small would be nice). Now onto the minifigs!</p>
<p>Officer- The basic police officer,&nbsp;and&nbsp;he also should be&nbsp;the most well known as he&nbsp;was the &quot;main character&quot; in the animations on&nbsp;the Space Police site. He also has a rather large&nbsp;flick-fire weapon.</p>
<p>Snake-&nbsp;He's creapy! the single big eye and the thin look gives him a slimey criminal&nbsp;appearance. He also has an odd helmet with spikes and some strange mouth guard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the main reason one would buy this set is the ship itself. The&nbsp;color scheme is mostly black with some red and&nbsp;shades of grey. And then there's the giant yellow crate.&nbsp;The detail is nice.&nbsp;It uses some small pieces&nbsp;for engine detail and has&nbsp;well crafted front weapons. But most of the detail comes from the stickers. There are a lot of scratched up looking marks on&nbsp;the ship and crate. On the hood, you'll find a skull and some bullet sratches. The crate has the most stickers. There's tones of unreadable grafitti and some bullet/asteroid impact marks.&nbsp;Along with that are some Space Police symbols&nbsp;with the&nbsp;skull over it. They even included the word Blacktron on it, which I believe to be a past Lego&nbsp;Space theme. One of the strangest symbols/words on here is&nbsp;the name Adam with a crown over it. Don't ask me what that means.</p>
<p>The main &quot;function&quot; for this set is the crate. It's able to open up to reveal the stolen cannon.&nbsp;Snake also&nbsp;apparently&nbsp;played a game and put tally marks over the word &quot;police&quot; on the cannon. Once again there is great detail on the&nbsp;cannon's structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any problems with this set? Actually, despite my perfect score I gave it, there are some problems. One: Snake can't drive this thing. He's leaning so far back he can't reach the&nbsp;stearing wheel. The top of the truck also falls&nbsp;of easily. Then there is that big hole in the back of the truck which is&nbsp;easily&nbsp;seen when the crate is open. Speaking of the crate, the top&nbsp;of it is very weak- just some long plates with no connection between them. There also is no way to to keep them held together, but this can be fixed with a simple 1x2 plate.&nbsp;The cannon also swivels around a lot, but I&nbsp;can ignore that. Underneath, there&nbsp;are more holes showing how hollow it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this is a great set. I say for $30 it's a great deal. I only wish it was a bit more sturdy and the Officer had his own vehicle. But I say, go ahead&nbsp;and pick it up if you find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"vexorian","2010-06-20T23:43:12.687Z","Not the ugliest space set yet - Kinda cool","<p>I was able to get this set at 14 USD. It is a cool evil space truck. However it got 3/5 here's why:</p>
<p><b>Building experience</b><br />
There was nothing very interesting in there. However it is cool to see how such bulky thing is formed. Although it was fun for me, I found a couple of issues. It was not easy in some situations to differentiate brown and black in the instructions. Also, the stickers are omnipresent. Oh and there is a very difficult part of the build in which you have to connect the containers to the ship, it needs a lot of care else you'll destroy your containers and will have to build again.<br />
<br />
Something of notice is that the set is not a &quot;space&quot; truck until you put the wings on which is the very last steps. In fact, the wings are completely removable and with the laser hidden there is really nothing space-ish or futuristic about it. I think you can actually remove the wings and put wheels on it, and it could become a city set.<br />
<b><br />
Parts</b><br />
Well this is my first ship after dark age, so it is really the first space ship I built after possibly one of the UFO sets. Yet I did find some of the parts interesting. It comes with two of those flame pieces which you may remove if you don't like in ship engines and add them where they are needed the most (I plan to do it). It also has an assortment of brown pieces and varied trans pieces that are always useful for space. 4 of those new technic wings and two system wings. It is acceptable, 3/5.<br />
<br />
However, let me also mention the minifigs. The space policeman has a missile launcher, tank and two facial expressions and the alien is very cool. However, the alien is available in other two sets, so it is not a good idea to buy the set for just the minifigs. This increases parts score to 4/5.<br />
<br />
I really dislike stickers. Specially since I grew up at a time where prints where all around and they are much better overall. Of my old sets, all printed pieces are all right, but the sticker ones are really aged. I think stickers reduce the life time of a set overall, they are also hard to place correctly imho.<br />
<br />
<b>Playability</b><br />
It is a fun set. The hidden laser and the fact you can aim it is very nice. The whole concept of an evil space truck also makes it golden for display. The policeman has one of those missile launchers, however it was hard for me to shoot it, perhaps I need practice.</p>
<p>Althoug a fun set. I have a complain. Remember when space ships had openable cockpits? That's really not the case in here. In order&nbsp; to remove the alien, you have to remove the ceiling (which seems to be intentially loosely connected for that matter). But what's really annoying is that you have to remove the wind shield to put the alien back</p>
<p>The alien also misses a portable gun. But I am nitpicking, it still deserves 5/5 for playability.</p>
<p><b>Value for money</b><br />
For 14 USD, I am happy with the purchase, but I give it 3/5 since it was meant as a 30 USD set. Seriously, it was not worth such amount of money. I would really pay at most 20 USD for this set. Good to buy in a sale, bad to buy at retail price.</p>
<p><b>Overall<br />
</b>I like this set, but of course there are many things to consider, so it was not able to get more than 3/5.&nbsp; I would still recommend it if you are a space fan and found it for 14 USD or less.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,3

The cab of the truck continues the same ""Mad Max in space"" design from the other bad-guy offerings in the series.<br><br>The thing I think is coolest is the modularity of the engines and/or weapons pods. The rear engines are held on by a pair of standard technic pins each, while the front engines/weapons are each held on a single technic axle pin, meaning they're quick and easy to remove, as well as replace with something else. You could build multiple different engine and weapon modules and swap them out, even among other vehicles.<br><br>The only drawback I can see is that there is no bottom to the container, and it can't be removed. I would like to modify the build in the future to make the container removable, adding more modularity to the set, while harkening back to the modular theme of Blacktron. <br><br>The officer could've used a vehicle of some sort, but just do as I did when I was a kid - pretend the airtank is a jetpack and there's no problem.<br><br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
