"Targellian","2009-06-22T08:30:19.09Z","Two ships for the price of 3?","Essentially, the Pros and Cons from my earlier review of the 5974 Galactic Enforcer apply here as well, so I'll just stick to the two ships themselves...


Skull Interceptor.

This little bird is a cross between Mad Max's Interceptor, and something the bad guys in a James Dean movie might ride... a pimped out pick-up with spikes, fins and guns! Wide, flat and leery, there isn't an angle where it doesn't look intimidating. Sime nice use of SNOT building to maintain the lines, and the airscoop that completely blocks the drivers' view forward is a nice touch.

VX-Falcon

Sleek, clean and a very strong family resemblance to the Galactic Enforcer with the same paired-twin blasters on the nose with the up-thru-the-wing power cables. The engine exhausts are supremely ""greebled"" and remind me of the rocketships in the old Buster Crabbe Flash Gordon serials.

And therin lies my big gripe about this set.

Comparing the price/brick-count ratio for this set with 5971, 5972 and 5974 and it's clear this set is already noticably more expensive per brick... and now I've had the chance to build the set, I know how many of those bricks are one-studs used in the engine exhaust on the Falcon and £39.15 is too expensive for what you get.

The £34.25 price-point would have made this a 5-star review.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MayTheBricksBeWithYou","2009-07-04T09:48:41.543Z","Hovercar mania","I was absolutely thrilled when I got this set via the mail from LEGO. I was looking forward to this set for months and its everything I hoped for. 

You start the build by emptying the big long box with a lot of air, 4 numbered bags (numbered 1-3), two instruction books and (a bend) sticker sheet. Normally I don't like sticker sheets, but this one adds so much to the overall models. 

Book 1 and bags 1 and 2 instruct you to build the police vehicle. The vehicle has some nice details such as the extremely sleek cockpit (which is a pain to open up as there is no mechanism to do that), with an extremely long joystick composed of a white minifighead, a skelleton leg and a grey bicycle steer. Further is there the massive engines with a corona of boosters, great design feature (and a lot of parts indeed). 

Although the wings on the front look solid, as if they are round on the bottom side as well, but they are not. It would have been nice to place some sort of engine under there, especially because the stickers warn you for a ""hot surface"". The containment container looks and works like a charm. It pops open when you hit the marker and frees the other side of the Skull Twins. 

Speaking of the Skull Twins, you get (as the name would suggest) two of them, each with dual sided heads (just as the policeman) and nice jumpsuits. The legs are the same as those of the Snake figure. With a skull belt buckle and chain in the pockets. 

The Twins have an absolutely stunning hovercar, with a beautifully black and red colour scheme. A red line runs from the bonnet to the trunk, like it just hit some sort of space animal which left a bloody stain, but I doubt that TLC meant that :P A lot of SNOT techniques used on all sides. Two bumpers with a lot of cheese slopes for lights. And a nice techy wing flap contraption on the sides. 

It uses a lot of stickers but they serve a purpose, to make the car even more beautiful. Although I must say that the transparent stickers generate some 'noisy' pattern on a black brick, so much that you cant see some nice texts like ""I love insectoids"". 

Lastly the Twin car has some sort of gold safe with two bright yellow classic doors and three golden flat bricks that fit into the (open) trunk. I guess the Twins don't need oxygen because the windows are open and there is a large hole between the trunk and the interior. 

Anyway, I love this set so much I'll give it my maximum of 5 stars. Even though it is indeed a bit pricey, I love what you get for it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ankhofmishra","2009-07-07T15:58:31.153Z","Looks almost perfect","The Police ship is very comparable to the Space Police 2 Rebel Hunter (though obviously much more detailed). Single cockpit with a single-cell prison.

The Weapons are great, as well as what I would consider the best main engines i've seen.

My only complaint is the fact that the cockpit doesn't open, but there's always something wrong, right?


The enemy craft is downright awesome looking, and far far greater than the container heist ship. It's so much easier to get the pilot in and out, and the design is simply more believable.


Maybe it's because I'm used to inflated US prices, but I found nothing wrong with the price. I mean, when I look at either ship, I see a $25 ship. I'd easily pay $30 for the police one (though I am very biased towards all Space Police).

I strongly recommend this set for anyone who is into Space sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"krysto2002","2009-07-26T13:30:18.387Z","Lego Delivers Again","Perhaps one of the most overpriced sets in the series, this set passes its biggest flaw stunningly. The set includes two ships, the VX Falcon and Skull Interceptor, a gold safe stuffed with gold, a prison pod, one space police officer and two skull twins (thus the name).
Lego has spared no details and has lived up to its promise to use more SNOT in its models (for those who laughed, SNOT means Studs Not On Top).

VX Falcon: This ship lives the title Hyperspace pursuit. The ship measures up to the front of the Galactic Enforcer and has the most detailed engines I've ever seen outside of a UCS model. The ships front wings hold its weapons systems, with a hose-through-the-wing design like in the galactic enforcer. This shows that the series is hoding a decent amount of consistency between models. Not only is the Falcon large, but it is also detailed to perfection with lights, fins, antennae, and even a heat warning posted on the front wings; plus, the steering mechanism is actually believable. The bottom of the ship is also very slick. The ship only has a few problems. The cockpit must be removed in order to take the pilot out, the cockpit has no form of computer or gauges, there are no accessories for the pilot (ie a gun or handcuffs) and there are still to many stickers.

Skull Interceptor: Lego spared no expense making this ship look absolutely sleek and frightening. The ship is one of the only ships that is actually armed. This hot rod has two, YES TWO, missile launchers (not the flick fire kind). The speeder has fins, lasers, a trunk for the safe and details galore. However, there are some notable problems in the design. The roof is barely attached, the engine has a habit of coming off, some how the ship is not balanced and worst off, there is no room for the other skull twin. Either way, the ship is still tight and deadly looking, with a red stripe that continues from the hood to the roof, front and rear lights, and even a license plate (though I doubt it's registered...).

Minifigures:
Officer- Detailed and wearing a classic airtank. The design is perfect, but the helmet does not entirely  cover the face on back.

Skull Twin(s)- They earn their names, they wear identical uniforms with skeletal helmets made from a durable semi-flexible plastic that won't crack. 
Each skull twin can have either two or three eyes (it's up to you, I like one of each). Also, yet another helmet perfect for MoCs.

Classic references: By now, you've noticed Lego likes to include a few small tidbits from older sets. This set in particular has a few.
-The Interceptor's gastank has I ? Insectoids
-The Gold safe resembles the safes used in classic space sets such as 487-1 (look it up if you don't believe me)
-The Twins' uniforms are embroidered with the Octan logo, dating back to as early as 1992.

Pros & Cons

Pros 
- Two awesome ships
- Three minifigures
- Gold safe stuffed with gold
- Both ships well armed
- No flick fire missiles, just the good old spring launcher
- Detailed to perfection
- Removable prison pod
- Awesome engines
- ALL new figures fit in the prison pods, even frenzy and squidman

Cons
- Way over priced (with shipping and tax = about $60)
- Still too many stickers
- I can't get the second twin to fit in the ship
- No accessories
- Interceptor won't balance

"dim","2010-07-05T12:06:37.367Z","The core of Space Police III","<p>I believe that this set is covered thoroughly by other reviewers; therefore I will only put down some of my thoughts about it skipping the description;</p>
<p><br/>The main peculiarity of this set is that, unlike most of Lego Space sets, it doesn’t include a single vehicle, or a main vehicle plus a secondary opponent vehicle (like e.g. The <em>Galactic Enforcer</em> or the <em>Gold Heist</em>) , but it comes with two roughly equally sized flyers, a Space Police jet and a Black Hole Gang flyer. Only the <em>Freeze Ray Frenzy</em> follows the same concept of roughly similar in size space-bikes. The difference here is that the <em>Hyperspeed Pursuit</em> seems to be somehow the core model of Space Police III displaying the trademark function of the series; the Police spaceship comes with a space prison pod which the villainous flyer can shoot with its spring loaded shooter (two in this case) in an attempt to set the criminal free.</p>
<p><br/>By piece count this appears to be one of the best value for money SP III sets, but this is rather misleading; in reality one has to pay a hefty price for two rather small spaceships, and a large percentage of the pieces represents only tiny detail pieces. I wouldn’t pay more than €20-25 for each of these two spaceships but the official price of this set is a whopping €53 in Germany (I think it was even a tiny bit more expensive when the set came out a year ago). For this price we are used to get usually one item, but one which is larger, more detailed and with more functions.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong></p><strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><br/><strong>Building experience: 4/5:</strong> The build is fun, as you see the two spaceships taking form. The huge amount of decals does not daunt me, but I think they would be a challenge for children.</li>
<li><br/><strong>Parts: 4/5:</strong> There are interesting parts here and the total amount of bricks is well over 400, but the fact that there is no colour matching between the two spaceships, means that building a larger, consistent MOC out of the parts is impossible.<br/></li>
<li></li>
<li><strong>Playability: 3/5:</strong> Already by purchasing only this one set a child can start playing interesting dogfights without having to buy two separate sets. However the two spaceships are almost devoid of interesting functions, and Lego Space have spoiled us in the past to expect more on terms of hidden functions and playability from the larger sets.</li>
<li><br/><strong>Value for money: 2/5:</strong> By piece count it looks good, but&nbsp;one could expect&nbsp;more than two small flyers&nbsp;from the second most expensive set of the first wave of Space Police III.</li></ul>
<p>The spaceships look nice but I would have felt a bit cheated if I hadn't purchased this set with a good discount. Nevertheless this is the core set of SP III, and therefore a necessary buy for fans.</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,2

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2010-06-01T03:52:06.14Z","One of the most well-rounded and finest of the 2009 Space Police III Sets!","<p>Hyperspeed Pursuit is the last 2009 SPIII set I purchased in order to complete my collection, and it is easily one of my favorite, possibly rivalling my love of the Galactic Enforcer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROS</p>
<p>I will begin my&nbsp;review of this set in the way I begin every review of SPIII sets; total compliments to the minifigures. LEGO has outdone themselves in my opinion with these sets because both the criminals and the officers look excellent. The Skull Twins though, are not only my favorite minifigure criminals out of the entire SPIII line, but might quite possibly my favorite Minifigures of all time. They have a thuggish and rather frightening appearance to them and it just works so flawlessly. One thing I did not expect in this set with the Space Police officer to have air tanks. Usually, officers who are piloting vehicles do not have airtanks because they might interfere with the way they sit down in their spacecraft. This has bothered me because I really feel the SPIII officers are COMPLETE when they have them. Since this set's Space Police presence is a big spacecraft, I expected him to not have the air tanks. To my utter surprise, he did! On top of all of that, he could wear them and sit perfectly inside his vehicle at the same time which was really a treat. I feel the dual sided face used for this officer is a little too commonly used in this line but the figure is still fantastic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next Pro of this set are the two vehicles. For the first, we have the Space Police VX-Falcon (believe that it's name). It really is a great vehicle which also is built as good as it appears. It's one of SPIII's larger one-man space vehicles and it clearly is a mighty thing; six total laser guns, with the front ones looking considerably formidible. The thrusters on the ship, though rather tedious to build, are quite impressive. They bear a design seen a lot in this toyline of LEGO's and they look just as good on the VX-Falcon. The prison pod on the VX-Falcon is an immediate plus as well. I like those new pods and the ""blast open"" feature they all have. On top of all of that, this prison pod can be easily taken out and secured back in. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the VX-Falcon we have the Skull Interceptor. I think this vehicle tops as my favorite gangster vehicle in SPIII. It's rugged, intimidating and just a superbly built machine. What I enjoy about the Black Hole gang's vehicles are their common used of the ""four-wing"" design with is apparent on the Skull Interceptor. The machine also has two blunt launchers, some of the most powerful weapons LEGO has ever released. With two equipped on it, the Skull Interceptor should have little trouble blasting open a prision pod. It also has four laser guns, each one near a wing. I would have liked to see the Skull Interceptor come with an air-tight cockpit, but I don't get down about that when it comes to the gangster's vehicles because the gangster's are aliens and they probably can survive without oxygen or in space just fine. I will also mention that despite the hassle of stickers (a hassle I truly don't mind), the stickers on the Skull Interceptor are great. Not only do they look believable and boast the Black Hole Gang's symbol, but one of them has a shout out to the old Space line ""Insectoids"" with the words, ""I &lt;3 Insectoids."" This is commonly seen on Black Hole Gang vehicles, where shout-outs are made to Blacktron, Spyrius, and several others. I also like the yellow back plate of the Interceptor, which wears the cool word ""Zumbi"" in cryptic font. The safe with the gold in it is also tightly and securely held in the ""trunk"" of the Skull Interceptor by a small flap. I would've liked it more if the entire trunk were covered ""which it isn't"" but since the safe is not at all loose in it, I am totally fine with what LEGO did. As one more thing to add, the roof of the cockpit on the vehicle can easily come off and is easily secured back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONS:</p>
<p>To be thorough, I must state my qualms with this set. First off, on th VX-Falcon, the driver uses a steering handle to drive it. While I don't mind that factor, it is rather annoying to try and position the officer securely inside the ship while having him hold onto the handle. It can be done, but it's difficult, not to mention its equally difficult getting him out. On the Skull Interceptor, I was slightly disappointed that it can really only fit one of the Skull Twins in it, not both. I understand that LEGO intends for one of them to be locked in the prison pod, but when he's released, how on earth (or ""how in space"") will his comrade be able to hold him? Perhaps in the trunk, but I was hoping he could be fit inside the cockpit, as in perhaps a co-pilot's seat or something of the sort. Also, the Skull Twin who is driving the Skull Interceptor probably can't see too well because an engine piece is smack dab in front of the windshield. That would annoy me, but I'm not the pilot so who knows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, it's truly a fine set. There are some qualms I have with it, but the Pros speak for themselves. After you've completed this set, you'll be left with two incredible models you'll be proud that you built, and some great figures along with it. 5/5 Final score!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"oleksoccer","2009-12-18T09:16:33.247Z","sweet set","This set is my largest Space Police set and my favorite so far. It comes with the Space Police officer that is the main character of the videos, and the Skull Twins (who are sweet). I love their Octan jackets - you can just switch the hands to yellow and you can have a City minifig wear them.
VX Falcon:
5/5. Simply awesome. The overall design is very sleek and looks really cool. My only problem is that the cockpit is hard to open. You have to either take out one of the pieces under it, or use a knife or something to lever it out.

Skull Interceptor:
5/5. It has firing Technic cannons, a safe with 3 gold pieces (yay) and a storage compartment in the back that can be used for cargo or passengers. 

My other gripe is that this set is slightly overpriced. $50? Come on, it should be like 10 dollars cheaper.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"benjadude11","2010-02-24T14:59:07.17Z","Terrible Box, Great Set.","This set really, really, wowed me except for the box. Ouch.

First, the box highlights the Skull Twins vehicle, when really the space police one is far cooler. Second, Why are the police chasing the skull twins? if Twin 1 is trying to brake Twin 2 out of the pod, wouldn't the Skull Twins vehicle be chasing the space police one? Third, why is the skull twin vehicle discharging one of it's rockets when its' enemy is behind it? 

Anyway, the box is trivial. This is a great set, but the best part about it is that there is room for it to be so much greater, so that the buyer can MOC it up and make it his own. For example, three really easy modifications for the Skull Interceptor are listed here: #1: take a flat 6x4 piece in black and attach it on to the hinge piece holding the gold safe in place, making a really nifty trunk. #2: It looks better if you switch out the translucent green pieces acting as lasers for translucent red or orange. #3: flip over the wing pieces used in the front so that they point the same way as the ones in back. 

Minifigs:
*Spoiler alert!* I am about to say what the skull twins faces look like under their helmets, so if you don't want to know until you buy the set for yourself, skip to the next paragraph now. They have white heads, first, and double faces, one with two eyes and one with three. The eyes have strange eyelashes and the mouth is contorted into a weird smile/grimace thing. The space police guy is average, love the classic scuba-style jet pack.

Box/Price: See above

Build: 
Surprisingly lengthy. :) The set, as are all SP3 sets, is absolutely swamped in stickers. Half of the weight of the skull interceptor is in stickers. I don't mind one or two but total, the set has 26. No joke. I counted.

Playability: Wonderful. I knew it would be. You can tell just by looking at the box. The fact that is comes with two evenly matched vehicles is great. The prison pod breaking open mechanism works, just not very well. The top part gets pried off more than it explodes off. Oh well. 

Overall, I would recommend this set to anyone, especially fans of SP3 who don't mind a lot of stickers or a little MOCing. :)
