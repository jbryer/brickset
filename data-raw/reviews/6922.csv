I have just finished the majestic build of the Galactic Enforcer - for me it encapsulates everything Lego stands for historically, presently and for tomorrow...

Through the 2-book build there are so many nods to classic-space it is so refreshing.  Window blocks, wings, seating areas...You know you have something special in your hands from the off the moment the blue tinted cockpit shields come out of their bags....!

While I don't want to spoil the suprises, this is a real ""build"" with intricate crew areas, computer terminals, equipment and the all time classic space feature of segmentation.... ;) - those classic space sets really set the pace!! 

Great crew heros, cunning bad guys and the priceless statue (do your research!) this is a very strong offering into what is fast becoming one of the must-have lines.  

If you have even a passing interest in Lego Space or yearn for the classic times back, this could well boost your memories/inspiration for ventures into the stratosphere....

Enjoy

Pros:
It's SPACE, baby!
Solid construction
Great detailing that doesn't compromise the structure
Some gimmick bricks, but nothing too Duplo.

Cons:
Personally, I don't like the visor/flying-helmet combo... should have used full-face helmets.
None of the cockpits hinge open.
Stickers (but see below)

The finer details...

First off, the stickers. Myself, I hate them and never use them, but the sheet in this set are a style I haven't seen used in Lego before. Instead of printing on glossy paper, they're printed on clear vinyl. Much better quality this way, and probably a great deal more durable in smaller hands where water damage is quite likely.

On the subject of smaller hands, the ""grab point"" of the main ship is the hinged roof over the Forensics Lab/Storage Bay. Unless you've got adult sized fingers, chances are your thumb won't reach far enough to grip the ship walls, and the roof will come off in your hand... typically, just as the model itself is 2 feet off the floor and high enough to drop and shatter. It's still a very ""swooshable"" ship even with that note of caution.

The Alien Strike craft has the usual 'hair trigger' on the missile launcher... the statue, which I love, has the wrong style of helmet (understandably) and doesn't really fit into the rest of the set... I'm not a fan of the long 'whip' style antenna, they're just begging to get bent or broken... there's nowhere to store the grenade-launcher... 

... but these are just niggly little complaints, and even combined they're not enough to damage the overall impression of a great set, that's obviously been well thought out. There's a couple of advanced techniques used in the build, but it's not something that feels like it's being forced on you to satisfy a pre-determined shape required by a license.

The modular main ship is an excellent design, and compares very well to the 6980 Galaxy Commander. The buggy sits in the rear of the main body, just like the 928 Galaxy Explorer. All the touchstones are all there, and considering the gap between this theme and the last ""Space"" incarnation, you can't help but feel that Lego have done their utmost to maintain the continuity.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ovid07","2009-07-09T09:45:38.28Z","Finally. . .","Note: Sorry if this review is very long, but there is so much I want to say about this great set!  For reader convenience I have used Subtitles.
Intro:
For a long time it was very hard for me to post a review of this set, because, it means so much for me.  First, I've been waiting (and dreaming) of a release of true, vintage, space for a long time. As I grew up in the late 90's and early 2000's, I missed experiencing real Lego Space, not just looking at pictures on some internet database and buying sets off Bricklink.  Second, I have been waiting since last fall or so for this specific set.  When I first saw pictures of this set from the toy fair, I knew I had to have it, and have been eagerly waiting it's release since then.  And finally, this is just an awesome set.  I really don't know if my review will be able to justify the great time and effort that must have gone into making this set, but, I'll try.

The Minifigures:
Not to start hounding this set after my introduction made it sound so great, but I am slightly disappointed in the number of minifigs.  In most 99.99 (USD) sets you get around eight or so minifigs (with the exception of the Power Miner's Titanium Command Rig), but in this set you only get five.  Other than that, this set has a great selection of minifigures.  The three Space Police officers each have different heads, and you get the only (so far) female Space Police Officer.  Also this is the only set with Slizer (so far), who, with the exception of his ""troll head"", isn't too bad.  The only other disappointment is you get another Kranxx instead of a new and different alien.

Kranxx's Spaceship Thing:
At first I thought I was going to despise this vehicle, but, overall, it isn't too bad.  The four wings give a nice look to it, and the color scheme helps give it that ""bad boy"" feeling.  The cannon used to free Slizer from his prison pod is  also a nice feature, the only drawback of this vehicle being the huge amount of decals.

The Galactic Enforcer Itself:
Where can I start?  This is really where the set shines, making up for all of the decals, the lack of minifigures, and even the use of a troll head for Slizer.

The front Section: 
The front part of the ship with the driver in it can detach from the rest of the ship, and looks very nice on it's own.  The use of Slave I's windshield looks very nice here, and, along with the rockets on the bottom wings, and the plastic tubes connecting to the lasers in front, it helps create a very swooshible/aerodynamic feel.  Inside the cockpit the driver can sit comfortably (fits well) and has plenty of controls.  As a bonus Lego even threw in a little robot that stands above the driver (perhaps the auto-pilot?)!

The Middle Section:
The two engine/jet things in back break off also leaving the middle part, or essentially the main section of the ship.  This is probably the best part of the ship as it encludes four new alien contanment pods, a control center, and a caro bay to store the space buggy.  The contamen pods look very nice, as here the decals are attcually a plus (they read ""Prison transport pod may contain alien atmosphere. Danger!"" and ""Danger: Feild Generator""), and the fuction where the alien can escape (by shooting the target to split the pod) works very well.  Compared to other lego spaceships, the control center is much more emese, as it strecths all the way from the blue windsheild at the front of the middle section to where the buggy is in the back.  It includes a second driver seat up in front with multiple controls, another set of control pannels with a rotating chair, and a second chair set infront of a large tool rack (this set has plenty of assersorys for the minifigs).  The back section which stores the space buggy has a folding ramp in back, and the buggy itself is excellent (no decals! ! !).

The End Section/Two Engine Things:
In an effort to increase playibiltiy Lego added a area for a driver in each engine, and allowed them to split off from the rest of the ship.  Reasliticly this is very odd, but becuase Lego is a toy, and toys are made for play, I'll just brezee over this one small shortcoming.  The engines themselves look great, however, as they are made by using SNOT to connect two airplane roof pieces on thier sides to each other.  The thrusters also look great as Lego used old scuba fin pieces to go around the outside of them.

Overall:
This is a perfect set, as even minor flaws can't do anything to a well deserved rating of 10/10.  Normally, I end my reviews with my Overall impressions, but, today I've decided to pay tribute to in my opinion, one of the best parts of this set.

The Statue:
Even though this statue is only around ten pieces, it's one of the main reason I bought this set.  Engraved on the bottom of it (attuacly, it's just a sticker) it says ""In Annos Triginta Ad Caelum Infinitum Construxit"" which means something along the lines of ""Thirty years of building in the infinte heveans"".  This is great, because Lego is paying tribute to classic space, showing this set is a continuation of Space Police I, and doing even more.  More you say?  Yes, I do say more.  By making this statue Lego is bringing back memories to AFOLs who grew up with Classic Space.  Lego is making it all worth while for that collector (like me) who has wanted something to sum up his collection, and, has found it.  And finally, Lego has inspired that young kid who got this set for his or her birthday or for some holiday, to look back and discover true Lego Space, and, to be inspired.

"ankhofmishra","2009-07-16T09:24:49.403Z","Among the best of the flagships","First of all, very glad they released this set so soon in the U.S., I ordered it the day it was available :)

I'm a huge fan of the early 90's era Space collection (M-Tron through Exploriens). I have all of the large M-Tron, Blacktron and Space Police 2 sets. This particular ship is what the Mediator wanted to be. While not as stream-lined, this ship has one huge this going for it: use of space.

The main cockpit has a nice control panel and joysticks, and room for a pilot and droid (cute droid, I must say).

The second cockpit is robust with a open entryway to the main housing, and includes awesome control bricks and joysticks. The main housing has 2 control bricks, swivel seat and stationary seat. Along with these are some various handheld items. Simply put, the best use of space on a shuttle I've ever seen.

Behind this is the ATV storage, which fits even with a guy sitting in it, and rolls nicely out via the ramp.

The engines on this sucker are also something to love. Only the engines on the Hyperspeed persuit set look cooler. Such detail on main engines are something to be appreciated.

The vast array of weapons is very well done, with 2 twin cannons on the main front end, and 2 quad cannons on the rear wings.

The capsuls are a little strangely placed, but it's not problematic enough to take away from the ship as a whole.

Oh and one more thing, holy value in piece count batman! All of the above mentioned detail is brought to you by an enormous amount of awesome pieces. If I were still into freestyle building, this set would have been a gold mine!

I can compare this well with the Mediator and Exploeriens starship, and they are not nearly as good. I'm sure this is up there with the Ice Planet's ship, but I haven't seen one in person yet.

"krysto2002","2009-07-07T23:47:12.297Z","Classics Reborn","Although this set has some inevitable flaws, it is an instant classic. There are many notable ""flashbacks"" in the set, which add to the grandeur of this ship.

Included in the set is a mini speeder with a technic cannon, a classic space statue, a buggy, the galactic enforcer with two detachable mini ships, three space police figures, kranxx and slizer, plus four prison cells and plenty of accessories. However there is little for the bad guys, barely even room for slizer.

First, the buggy. I haven't seen a sloped design like this one since blacktron II. The airtanks on the front reminds me of the classic space buggies except this design has them held on by a pin rather than a 1x2 plate with one stud. Also, the lights on the back can be rotated back as a brake for the wheels, a surprisingly great touch if you don't want it rolling around.

Kranxx's speeder is equipped with a technic cannon (I sill like the old design better). The cannon IS in fact strong enough to pop open the cells like shown on tv (the minifigures don't fly out though). For a spring loaded missile, it is actually very powerful and has an amazing range. The craft is well designed (although covered in stickers) and has a tiny message scrawled on one wing (Spyrius Rules!). If that isn't enough. the speeder has a tow cable, an antenna and twon blasters on front.

Minifigures: The space police all look great, and there is even a female officer (just like in Ice Planet 2002). The two bad guys, kranxx and slizer are both well designed, even kranxx's printed head, which with the neck inderneath, makes it seem he actually has a mouth. Slizer's helmet looks great, and I'd recommend it for custom minifigures, simply because it looks so fearsome. There is also a robot drone that is built from a menagerie of parts

Galactic Enforcer: The newest addition to the lego space arsenal of motherships. This one sits right alongside the Mission Commander, Galactic Mediator, Deep Freeze Defender, Explorian Starship, and all of the rest.
  This ship is modular with detachable parts, like the Deep Freeze Defender and the Galactic Mediator. The front and middle come apart and the engines detach and can reattach to the front to form a smaller ship. 
  The front is very spacious, and could probably fit an extra pilot, as well. The front is also well armed with blasters and all. 
  The mid-section is rather thin, but unlike the Galactic Mediator, this ship is filled to the brim. There is storage for weapons, a lab, a command post, and what appears to be a control station for the mid-section's dual quad blasters (two sets of four) which can rotate freely up to 90 degrees in almost every direction. The door to the back unfolds like a ramp, and holds the buggy just fine. The cover on top flips back to reveal the whole thing, but it sometimes snags. The roof is not as sturdy as I'd like it to be and can fall of if you hold the ship by it. This can be a problem for younger builders.
  There are also two detachable fighters that sub as the ship's engines. Each one fits the pilot perfectly, however having a rounded bottom, they are impossible to stand up. The oval design is also rather awkward.
  On the sides are four prison pods, room for the set's two villains and any of their friends. The pods are pretty roomy and will fit any of the figures into it (I'm not sure about Squidman, I haven't tried yet). The fronts list a realistic warning of the pods contents and how foreign gasses may be contained. The ""targets"" on the tips are supposed to be field generators, and when hit by the missiles, pop the top off the pods just like on tv.

Overall a great set, but a tad pricey. There are way too many unnecessary details which could have been used to enlarge the set. The problem is that the set is about the same size as all of its predecessors, but costs nearly twice as much.

Pros:
-great set with many classic references and designs
-cool minifigures, just enough to fill the set
-new robot drone
-folding top and opening back
-modular with twin detachable fighters
-modular parts come off without having to tug or pull hard
-return of printed parts
-pop open pods
-plenty of accessories
-powerful missile launcher
-detailed to perfection
-classic statue*
-heavily armed
-Sturdy ship
-enough spare parts to customize

Cons:
-Roof can fall off
-Needs another ship for Slizer
-Way too many stickers, especially those on curved surfaces, which tend to peel off.
-perhaps too detailed (matter of opinion)
-on the expensive side...
-windows must be removed to open
-fighters won't stand up
-no accessories for the bad guys
-some details are a little too sporadic (again a matter of opinion)

"dim","2010-01-21T10:47:57.513Z","Very nice indeed!","This set is excellent indeed. Better than I thought when I first saw pictures. It's a very entertaining build, aesthetically pleasing and with good playability. Easily up there with the other best large spaceships. I think it is one of these sets where children can really delve into its microcosm. 
Only tiny complaint is the fact that the 4 prison cells extend too far out and are almost as wide as the wingspan, a fact that looks rather awkward. But I found an easy solution: Remove all four cells from their transversal position and place two of them longitudinaly, parallel to the direction of the fuselage. Pronto!

"dragon_teenager","2012-03-05T10:40:12.303Z","One of my favorite Space sets.","LEGO Space has a long history of excellent capital ships, including Space Police 2's Galactic Mediator and Ice Planet 2002's Deep Freeze Defender. 2009's Galactic Enforcer is a modern update of these classic sets, and despite a few design missteps it has become one of my favorites.<br><br>The most impressive part of the Galactic Enforcer is probably its sheer size, which rivals the Explorien Starship from 1996. However, unlike the Explorien Starship, the Enforcer has a very solid construction and feels like a much more substantial model. The white and dark blue color scheme suits the theme well - although some have criticized Space Police 3 for feeling more like a ""future City"" theme than a true Space theme, there's no denying that the Enforcer is a love letter to the classics. This is evident in the set's modularity, which is clearly inspired by the designs from the 90's. Four different sections of the ship can split apart and function as individual vessels, or combine in different ways to form mid-sized star ships. Unfortunately, the Enforcer's appearance is pretty clunky unless you leave it the way it's shown on the box. In this respect, the classic capital ships are definitely superior, since the modularity was executed with far more class. <br><br>If you're like me, though, you probably don't care about the modularity anyway. There's a lot to love here, including the spacious cockpit and miniature police droid. One of the set's best features is the interior, which is fully realized with a hinged midsection that opens to reveal a control panel and weapons cache. There's even a swivel chair to seat one of the police troopers. Aesthetically, the Enforcer is a beauty, with convincingly large thrusters that don't feel disproportionate to the rest of the ship (something many of the 90's sets lacked) and hinged turrets that help the ship feel like a real star cruiser. The back of the ship opens to release a small police buggy. Like the modularity, this feature is undoubtedly a throwback to the Galactic Mediator, which had an identical feature. The buggy itself is nice enough, if a little bare bones. It's one of the few ground vehicles ever released in Space Police 3. <br><br>There are four ""prison cells"" attached in pairs to either side of the star ship. Again, these are an obvious throwback to the prison cell system featured in the earlier interpretations of the Space Police concept. Unfortunately, this version is probably the weakest. There are targets attached to each pod that you are supposed to shoot with the spring-launcher attached to the villain's ship. On the off-chance that you actually manage to hit one of the targets (which would be a pretty impressive feat), the entire pod breaks apart. It's a pretty clunky system and probably the weakest element of the Space Police 3 theme. <br><br>On the other hand, the minifigs are great. This set includes the only female police trooper released with the theme, and it's a great little touch. The aliens are just lovely - both are extremely unique and very collectable. One of the coolest additions to the set is a LEGO Space statue (which the aliens are trying to steal, for some reason) - it's a cute little throwback that adds a lot of charm to the overall package. The only flaw here is the lack of airtight Police helmets (this was changed with the second wave), and lack of police troopers. It's a pet peeve of mine when a large set like this doesn't include enough minifigs to properly man the vehicle. <br><br>The flier is basically a giant spring-launcher with wings attached, but it's quite a bit better than some of the other Space Police 3 throwaway speeders. Still not fantastic, but it does add some play value to the set. <br><br>Overall, I can't see any Space fans being disappointed with this beauty. It's a massive ship, and a fantastic display piece. It gives the 90s classics a run for their money in a lot of ways, and although those sets will never be replaced, this release can stand tall among them for sheer display value alone. It suffers from some of the flaws that all modern LEGO sets do - stickers, overemphasized play features, etc. But the overall package is incredibly satisfying and extremely fun. I highly recommend this set. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

I thought about getting it for a long time, and decided to go for it just before it was discontinued luckily. Im extremely happy I did!<br><br>The design is excellent, reminds me of the 'Deep freeze defender - 6973' which was a favorite of my childhood. You could re-shape the set thanks to the connector pegs and play with it in many different ways! This set has the same possibilities, removable engines, and pods on the side which can fly off when flicking the switch, very cool! There is a sticker sheet but I never applied them, it still looks fantastic without them!<br><br>Nice to see a spaceship in white but there is enough other black and bright translucent pieces to stop it looking bland. I also like the addition of the fins all over the ship!<br><br>There is a good selection of arches in black and white, some large blue translucent pieces which looks great against the white. Some bricks that streamline the set I have never owned before and would probably find them hard to use on a MOC. <br><br>The set is one of the best for playability ive seen in a long time, the ship is very customisable due to peg connectors and can be arranged many different ways. There is a nice little quad and bike for a chase. My favorite part is the control room in the middle, the roof is hinged and feels very sturdy and well designed, a few printed bricks, seats and weapons are inside.<br><br>I am not too interested in figs generally, but I do like the torso's on the police, perhaps a bad guy exclusive to this set would have been appropriate as the two can be bought in other lower priced sets. However special note of the Spaceman statue fig, I really like this fig even if it is plain, it pleases an adult like myself as its similar to spacemen sets from long ago! :) Thanks Lego &nbsp; <br><br>I paid around 59GBP at the time for this set, a decent price per piece. I feel the set was accurately priced.<br><br>I have seen most of the flagship space sets over the years but was never tempted to purchase them until this one and its unlikely ill buy another one for a while as I believe this one will take some beating. It's so well designed, looks great and reminds me of being young because of its similarity to 6973. <br><br>I couldn't recommend this higher, for anyone whom space is their favorite theme, they must purchase this set!

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2010-03-14T00:08:13.887Z","A Monument to LEGO's 2009 Toys","<p>I am once again doing a lengthy review of Space Police III sets, and this time it's the largest set of all; the mighty Galactic Enforcer.</p>
<p>PROS</p>
<ul>
    <li>To be complete, I must once again state how much I love SPIII minifigures. The criminals are fantastically designed and the officers are very convincing. This set is also unique in that it contains the &quot;Space Police Robot&quot; minifigure. This is also the only set that contains the so-called &quot;neutral&quot; figure, the Space Police Statue, which is a wonderful and memory-evoking figure. One of my preferences is that all officers come with a set of black air-tanks. The wonderful thing about the Galactic Enforcer is that all three officers included somewhere have air-tanks stored for their use. Two air-tanks are stored in the &quot;lab&quot; area, and one is stored on the front of the quad.</li>
    <li>The Galactic Enforcer also has a brilliant design and a sturdy build (not to mention that it is a feast for the eyes to look at). When you pick up the completed model, not only does it feel rather heavy and strong, but it feels sturdy and secure. The wonderful thing about the design is that it allows for a highly nostalgic feature that SPIII is known for using; rebuild-able ships. The two main thrusters on the ship double as two detachable flyers. The front of the ship also can be removed to make its own flyer, but to upgrade it further, the two flyers on the back can be reattached to the main cockpit to form a smaller version of the Galactic Enforcer. It's truly a masterfully designed system that heavily adds to playability. On top of all that are four detachable prison pods, a brilliant feature unique to SPIII.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Another wildly entertaining feature about this set is the lab, or as LEGO calls it, the &quot;forensic lab.&quot; It in fact is more than a lab really. There are two computers which I suspect are used for the forensic studies, but there are also tool racks that hold the previously mentioned two air-tanks, as well as three laser blasters, two walkie-talkies and a &quot;metal-detector&quot; piece.</li>
    <li>Some people have criticized the Black Hole Gang's vehicle in this set, calling it &quot;gimmicky&quot; or &quot;cheap.&quot; I can see why they say that, but it's much better than the blunt-launching vehicle in Max Security Transport; point in fact, I actually quite like it. I've noticed that the Gang's vehicles all seem to don four wings in a unique reverse style manner that identifies them as gangster ships, and this one too has this same feature. Kranxx, who is said as the pilot of this ship sits comfortably in the ship and is quite easy to take out and put in.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
CONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sadly, there are a few things that I don't quite love about the set. One of them is the Space Police Quad. I don't like the way it looks and it is far too slanted back for my liking (though it does fit quite nicely in the back of the ship, and rolls smoothly down the convenient ramp). Also, the set comes with a hand-held flick-fire rocket launcher for an officer, but there is no place to securely store it. This does allow for the person building the set to come up with nifty ways of storing it (for instance in my case, I had the Space Police Robot hold the missile in one hand, and the launcher in the other), but I would've really appreciated a clip or area to store it.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The CONS are minor, and the PROS speak for themselves. The Galactic Enforcer is not just the finest set in the SPIII line in my opinion, but it ranks as one of the greatest LEGO sets I've ever purchased, if not THE greatest. I would recommend this set to anyone, and it brings back the memories of those who enjoyed the replayability of previous LEGO Space sets. 5/5.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4

For the playability, 5 because it is light, you can add more minifigs,it can split into 5 things(you may think it can only split in to four parts, the front, middle, and pods, but the buggy is the fifth part.) Let's face it, the pods suck. They take to many adjustments to work like Lego showed in the videos. For the other vehicle, a 3. It could have had another seat, or other place for slizer\kranxx when the other one is in the cockpit, and an ammunition holder for extra ammo.

	after some years not active building large Lego sets, i decided to buy this set (pricetag was ok - 59 &euro;).</p>
<p>
	I found it a pleasant build, the parts fit well and are sturdy. The spaceship has lots of accessories, incl. some gear which the minifigs can use in their pursuit of the bad guys.</p>
<p>
	The different setups which you can make are a real plus. I do miss some sort of cone for the two aft-parts with the boosters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The bad guys have a fast interceptor with a launch-tube. Children like this action :)</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		sturdy build</li>
	<li>
		good parts</li>
	<li>
		unique statue</li>
	<li>
		large</li>
	<li>
		good value</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		stickers... some really gave problems. In the old days, the decoration was printed on the bricks.</li>
	<li>
		the 2 pods aren&#39;t attached firmly to the front cockpit...</li>
	<li>
		had to use superglue to attach the flame exhaust to the fuselage of the small raider.</li>
	<li>
		no alternative build-instruction: high part count but no alternative build (i imagine it would make into a great robot)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>
	a fun kit, lots of playability. Smaller children love the different canopies and places where they can put the minifigs in. The different sections of the spacecraft are an added bonus when playing.&nbsp;</p>

We had lots of fun playing with is and its an amazing value for money :) but then something bad happened. The whole thing fell apart in an instant and&nbsp;I realised how bad the structure was. This ruined my £65 and all the peices were lost. I was&nbsp;very angry and upset about how bad it was properly built and the ship seemed very cool at the start but then wasted my birthday money. This set is all in all quite bad and I would not think about buying it again.</p><p><strong>Pros -</strong></p><p>Cool looking.</p><p>A very fun build.</p><p>2 subcrafts.</p><p><strong>Cons -</strong></p><p>Can be a waste of money.</p><p>Bad minfigs.</p><p>Generally not the best craft lego has made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for reading ;)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,2,5,5,4
"charliebucket","2017-04-26T00:03:41.71Z","One of the best sets of 2009","<p>Is this the set for you? &nbsp;Let&#39;s see! :)</p>

<p>Note: &nbsp;I got this set used without the box&nbsp;so I can not give an accurate review of the box and contents and as such I won&#39;t describe the contents and box size.</p>

<p>Minifigs: The three included police officers are standard fair for the 2009 Space Police III sets. &nbsp;Kranxx&nbsp;has also appeared in a fair few sets as has Slizer and the small droid looks nice but is nothing special. &nbsp;The statue, however is very well done and is a nice homage to the original space line.</p>

<p>The build: The build will take between 1 1/2 to 3 hours depending on&nbsp;skill/speed and although a long build it&#39;s mostly quite enjoyable. &nbsp;Sure there are areas that get a tad repetitive (The prison pods) but overall it&#39;s a fun build.</p>

<p>The finished model: &nbsp;The completed model is about as big as Lego sets get, size wise. &nbsp;And the modular system is another fun nod to the themes past and the interior detail looks great, too. &nbsp;The included get-away spaceship looks nice although I never liked open air speeders in outer space. &nbsp;The small buggy is a nice inclusion aswell.</p>

<p>Overall: This set is worth every single cent of the large price tag, used or MISB. &nbsp;Sure it might not be the most memorable set of 2009 but I think it is the best and I am sure it&#39;ll still look good 10 years from now. &nbsp;The only downside is that I need to get all the other Space Police III sets to display with it!</p>
