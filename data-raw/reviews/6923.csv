"dvsDave","2009-05-26T13:37:01.67Z","Beautiful Lines, Good Accessories, Oddly missing one feature","I got this set off of eBay and was pleasantly surprised by the lines of the truck.  It's a well done 6 brick wide truck.  Great accessories.  You get a wrench, radio, ax, saw and the two little traffic cones.  I was a bit disappointed by the lack of a real mechanism for raising and lowering the hook arm.  It's just propped up and the layout only really offers two positions.  Although, what you don't see is a place to snag the hook when you aren't towing anything to keep it from swinging loosely when in motion.  

I finished this truck and kept feeling like something was missing.  It nagged at me for about an hour then I realized!  There's no ""controls"" to operate the towing arm or hook.  I was expecting some of the radios antennae/levers to be on the side so you could position the minifig to look like he was operating the arm.  But no dice.  I think I'll add them to the set when I get home.

The instructions also have the same flaw that is my usual beef with Lego when it comes to stickers.  They have you put the stickers on the towing arm AFTER you mount it to the truck.  I would recommend putting them on before mounting the arm, it will make your life much easier.  

Other than that, I just thankful to have a real tow truck in my collection.  Definitely makes for some new possibilities for my Lego diorama shelf at my office.

       I was really looking forward to this set but when I opened the box and tipped out the contents I couldnt help but feel a little dissapointed. It was pretty obvious that there wasn't as many bricks in this set as there could have been.....
      So to building. It was actually a nice build and I love the orange bricks, allows some scope for an RAC (british roadside recovery service) van or two in my boys city, and, as mentioned in the previous review, apply all your stickers first, before building. The set itself was a nice straight forward build, alright I felt the steering wheel position was pretty high, but I let that slide because i relly like the new offset driving position..... I was however annoyed that there was no bricks between the cab and the winch! Into the spares box I went. 
      Again, to repeat the previous review, I too was a bit miffed to see there were no winch controls AT ALL? bIt stingy there lego dudes...
        Then when it was completed i took a long look at it and couldn't help but think the rear light bar was just a little skinny and the blue lights on the roof (blue lights? whats that all about anyway?) were simply not enough. So I loaded it up with lights on top, extended the rear bed a bit and replaced the rear light bar with a 2x6 flat. I was also a little confused as to why a recovery truck would have a disc cutter on board?
         Add to that the extra bits i put in by the winch workings and to be honest I was left feeling a little hard done by. I hope all the 2009 city kits aren't this sparce, as I already think they seem a bit overpriced. We wait and see.
        In summary then this is a very nice base kit, but be prepared to add a little to make it feel complete, and no doubt will be very playable in the city set up (if you can find anywhere to attatch the hook on the new style cars n vans!).

"aplbomr","2009-12-26T01:08:11.67Z","Great Heavy Hooker","This is a great addition to the City Theme.  It is a rugged truck that is well designed.

It could have used a couple of other parts (such as controls for the hooker), larger tires (or at least a lift), but all-in-all... it is a nice touch to the City Theme.  I did add controls and changed out the lights with other pieces - but the Hooker as is was designed nicely.

It is a beast that easily handles the broken down Sports Car (8402) and fits great with the Garage (7642).  For the price ($11.99 USD) it is a steal.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bryceg","2009-06-29T11:19:49.247Z","Great set!","I think this set is really good! They haven't made a tow truck in a while and I think they nailed it.

Overall the truck looks good with opening doors and winch. I think the winch looks fine and I am fine with no controls. Some tow trucks are operated by remote controls. Inside the storage doors there are all new flares, witch I think are really cool. The storage indents include, a walkie-talklie, a wrench, an ax, and a road saw. On the back bumper there is a hook to keep the crane hook in place.

I wish the cab had 2 seats instead of one but oh well.

This is a great compiment with the camper and if you have 15.00 dollars to  spend I think you should get it.

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-09-02T04:07:13Z","Just What Lego City Needs…","Having just had another birthday, I was pleased to find this was one of two sets I received.   I don’t have too many city sets except for the Camper (7639) and the Sports Car (8402) so this was a welcome addition.

The tow truck is presented in a bright ‘rescue’ orange colour with grey chassis and light grey wheel arches.   A heavy-duty grey front bumper is provided along with lights and a grill.   The truck features many smooth parts, such as the bonnet, roof and sloping panels towards the rear which frame the crane assembly.   The cab is quite wide yet only seats one minifig.   Opening doors are provided as is the driver’s seat.   To the rear of the cab are the tool storage sections, these are in an alcove slightly forward of the two built-in lockers.   The lockers hold the emergency traffic cones when not in use.   The crane arrangement lacks any controls but is provided with the winch and crane arm through which the towing line is secured, a grey hook is present on the end which should fit to the undersides of other vehicles requiring recovery (the new Lego vehicles don’t seem to fit though?!).   The crane arm can pivot and adjust to various angles to aid the recovery process.   Also supplied is a minifig in the form of a recovery driver.

It looks great, works well (apart from not being able to recover newer vehicles) and is a great package for the price … and a much needed addition to any city.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This was the first set i bought when i recently started collecting lego city again, and i love it. Just changed a few things to make it complete. 
 I have changed the blue lightbar to amber, as this is not an emergency vehicle in my opinion. I also aded amber lights in the grill, and some more details inside the cab, such as controls for the crane, and a mount for the walkie talkie.

"Boidoh","2009-12-26T16:31:12.153Z","GREAT","<p>I got this set in Christmas of 2009. It was a great gift i revieved with some other LEGO City sets. This was great and awesome with a really cool minifigure. It has some nice stuff which i will explain in the following review.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>This set came with clear insturction and a nice box. The box it self is calling to you saying ""buy me"". The instructions are kinda shorts which makes it built in no time at all, which is kinda good i guess.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts that came with it were great. Why are people hated with sticks? They say they want printed pieces and then they say that they dont want stickers because they use it for moc but if it was printed it would be no different if using for moc. Ok but that isnt what were talking about here. The only stickers i believe were for the crane piece and the sides and top for the 'Road Repair' symbol. I wish i could take the parts apart and use it but its also so cool right so alone. Its awesome. I wish i had an extra tow truck for the pieces.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set comes with a neat road repair member that comes in all blue. Beware that the hat may bend like&nbsp;what happened to me. If you buy more of these&nbsp;you can&nbsp;make an entire team of road rescue members.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>It was easy and simple like the Sports Car (even though i dont have it my friend does and ik how it was built). It was nice and im not sure how to express it here.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Great, Fantastic, more than a couple words can describe this thing, beside ugly, hideous and any other rude comments about it, this set is great! </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, this is so so so so so so so great. You must buy it before it goes from stores. I hear it just did. </p>

"Krogh","2009-12-30T10:51:09.513Z","Nearly perfect.","This is by far my favourite of the newer sets, so far. Then again, i don't own that many yet, hehe.

Anyway, it is for all intents an purposes, the perfect tow truck. Just one little detail. I HATE stickers!

So, on with the review. I really think that this is an excellent set. There are a few things i would have done differently, such as the lights on the roof, they really should not be blue, but, they did the same thing with the towtruck in the garage, and the helicopter transport, so i guess it makes sense in the Lego universe anyway, hehe. I would also have put in a window, so that the cabin would not be open, out to the tow crane. Other than that, i have no complaints. It's a brilliant set, it really is.

It's a fairly complex build for it's size, really entertaining, and there are lots of parts, so that's nice. When built, the model is also really sturdy, so it can be handled by a child no worries. It's built on a one-piece frame.

The color scheme is really nice to, and the model comes with two light cones, that can be set up to warn oncoming traffic, when hooking up the crane to a broken down vehicle. When not in use, the cones fits perfectly in the compartments, on the side of the truck. It also comes with some really nice tools. There's a wrench, a walkie, an axe, and even a round saw to cut up crashed cars, so that you can remove the passenger. All these tools have holders on the sides of the truck.

The minifig is okay, with nice sunglasses, and a cab. He has reflex stribes on his shirt, so that traffic can see him. Only thing is, he only has them on the front, so he'd better not turn his back on the moving traffic.

So, all in all i relly like this set, and to be honest, i would have given it a 5/5, if not for the damn stickers. :)

4/5, as i said, it's nearly perfect.

Finally i would just like to mention, that this truck goes perfect with the 8402 Sports car. The sports car comes with an orange emergancy phone, maching this truck, and the box art for it shows the car broken down, with smoke coming out the grill. ;)

"Fire6","2009-12-30T21:56:56.077Z","Good set....not perfect","A Tow Truck is needed in any collectors City to deal with cars that have broken down and help keep the streets clear.

"handerson","2011-01-14T13:51:27.2Z","Favorite set","I don't own TOO many Lego sets but I have a lot of the City collection trucks (lighting repair, tanker, cement truck, fire truck). This is by far my favorite one of all of those. The design is incredible and I love the color of the orange bricks. It's just something intangible about this set that really makes it stand out. Definitely recommend purchasing it!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"av8r1973","2011-01-04T09:29:26.907Z","Great truck to get your broken down cars to the garage","<p>We got this set to go with the garage we just purchased.&nbsp; I'm glad we did, since the big wrecker is difficult to get in and out of the garage bay.&nbsp; This little guy is a nice size in comparison to most of the 4-lug wide cars and trucks in the city, so the scale works well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great color combination, as in the garage set.&nbsp; It's not going to be mistaken for a municipal, fire or&nbsp;police&nbsp;vehicle, that's for sure. Not even with the blue lights.&nbsp; I've never seen a real wrecker with blue lights, but it works with the orange bricks pretty well.&nbsp; the rear wheels are about a lug or two too far back on the truck.&nbsp; It may be a factor of the ""chassis"" brick used, but the truck could have been made a brick or two longer to account for it.&nbsp; Minor gripe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was pretty complex with a new part (for me) on the tow boom.&nbsp; The Technic gear works well as a knob to retract the cable, but the whole winch isn't held down very strongly.&nbsp; I need to figure out&nbsp;a better way to anchor it if my daughters are going to play with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A bigger gripe are the wonderful accessories.&nbsp; As cool as they are (even a cutoff saw!), the little clips don't hold them well.&nbsp; When using the winch, the saw and the radio fall off almost every time.&nbsp; I guess the minifig should have them in his hands?&nbsp; The traffic cones are nice.&nbsp; I was pleased to see a rounded peg rather than just a stud to use as the beacon for the top.&nbsp; I would like to have seen a small dish for the bottom to be stabilizers like on the Mobile Police Unit truck.&nbsp; Not very stable cones.</p>
<p><br/>Minor gripes, but nothing's perfect.&nbsp; It's a great vehicle to have around your town and adds some unique color to the scene.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
