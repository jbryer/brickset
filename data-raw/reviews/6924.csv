It will appeal to girls as well as boys and -- something of a rarity these days -- it features ordinary minifigs doing ordinary things and not something connected to the emergency services or building sites!

-pan
-surfboard

Buy this set as soon as you see it! It is a nice set, and the doors are kept from swinging open, and is extremely sturdy. The only thing I had a problem with was putting the bike on the top. You have to stick one of the tires between one of the grooves in the tile piece. Overall, this set gets a 6/5!

"Cervelet","2009-06-05T12:07:49.123Z","Awesome!","First of: the design of this model is just fantastic. It combines the simplicity and aesthetics of the old city models with the more realistic and detailled construction of modern legos. The two lines ad a slick look. Even without stickers, it looks awesome. It is fairly robust (only the bike falls rather easily) build relying more on solid bricks than metapieces, which works great.

The play function are really neat. you get a surfboard (I had never expected to see those again. Sweet!), a little portable oven thingie and a bicycle for outdoor activities, and the back open in a clever way to gain access to the simple but roomy interior.You get a little TV (it's a sticker by the way), a frying pan, 3 (!) chairs and just like in real life a minifig can go sleep in the little space over the cabin.

The piece account is good, especially considering the neat pieces that can be found: car baseplate, chairs, fish, bike, surf board, lots of cuverd pieces, REAL car doors, big-truck-roof-thingie...

The minifigs are sweet, the girl has an awesome hair cut and a nicelly designed torso with backprint. he guy has the Clark Kent haircut and the old beach-shirt design I knew from my childhood.

Overall, it's a fantastic lego modell. If you want some nitpicking, well, the TV could have been printed and two bikes instead of one and a surfboard would have allowed bike tours. But those points are completely overshadowed by the good points.

Price: 5/5 I feared Lego would ask 20 bucks for it when I saw it in the shop but it turns out this one is absolutely not overpriced. If you don't have much money to invest in legos, take just this one!

Pieces: 5/5

"bryceg","2009-06-28T12:20:37.763Z","Legos best set yet!","This is the best example of what lego is capable of!

Minifigs: Comes with 2 figures a girl and a boy. The girl has a nice new hairstyle, and the boy comes with a nice printed shirt.

Camper:The camper is a six stud wide camper with working doors! Haven't seen one of those in a while! Over the steering wheel and seat is the roof. Inside the roof you can put a minifigure in to sleep, just like the real ones!! I'm glad it is not flat fronted like the trucks for a long time have been. In the back there is a 1 stud wide table, a TV, and a frying pan. There is also a ladder in the back. The truck has hinges so you can open it up and play inside. There is a light at the back,but i still haven't figured out its purpose other than to keep the two parts of the truck together.

Cons: There is no real place to put the grill, and the fish always fall off. The last con is when I take the roof off to put the figure inside, it takes me a while to put the roof back on.

These are small things, so i don't make a big complaint on it. If you want to get a small set, this is the one!           ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jamal_lts","2009-07-08T00:00:27.293Z","Ready for the Next Adventure","The color scheme for the camper is really pleasing. The green is the ones seen used in the Power Miner's sets
Goes well with the white caravan.

 The design of the caravan is also realistic. Details like the sleeping area, kitchen and the TV and grill. The ladder at the back of the van and the spotlight during the night time.

A great custom add on will be a retractable shading roof.

I personally like the idea of this Camper set. Who would have thought of this for LEGO city. Goes well with the Coast Guard sets or the Creator Beach House. Ready to help the Campers for a Sea Rescue.

The Camper sets also brought in new ideas for me. Perhaps a Forest Ranger or a Surfer's Cadillac / Van. Maybe a Surfer's Shack.

It was a cute little set with a cute little car and a cute little caravan with lots of transparent pieces. It's the only non-pirate set I remember with such strong fondness.

This set has much the same kind of feeling as that set, I knew as soon as I saw it that I had to have it. What is it about mobile camping vehicles that has such a strong attraction to me?

This set doesn't disappoint in any way. It has every accessory you could need; a frying pan, two cups, a grill with a fish, a TV screen, an indoor seating area, a surfboard and a bicycle. The woman has a new torso print and a wonderful new hair piece I hope to see much more of in the future. The only thing the set is lacking is a suitcase, but lots of other sets come with them anyway.

I'm not surprised that this set has received only five stars so far - what is there to fault about it?

I think the couple in the set are close friends with the couple from 4WD With Horse Trailer 7635, and that the camper often camps in the horse paddock. I also think I will replace the surfboard with a second cycle so the couple can go on bicycle trips together.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Naylus","2009-07-20T15:13:44.17Z","Nice Camper for Your Town","There's no doubt that any City-lover would enjoy this set. It's really nice, interesting to build and play. When You touch it or simply look at this beautiful car, You simultaneously think of forests, rivers and fresh air that these two minifigs can enjoy while travelling in their camper.

The set has no flaws. On the contrary - it's just the one that is well-designed, every detail. It has good chairs, wonderful car parts (just look at the doors!) and accessories. Not to mention the minifigs with rare hair.

"Wells","2009-07-12T22:47:23.217Z","Some remarks","First of all, this is quite a nice little set. There are a number of specialized parts in it that you just won't find anywhere else, such as the surfboard and the bicycle.

- There are stickers in the set, but they all fit on single pieces so pulling the set apart is not a problem, and except for the camper's top they are relatively generic pieces that the stickers attach to in the first place.

- The kit comes in two bags, each labeled by number so that the build is very easy.

- As stated in other reviews, the fish does not stay attached to the grill very well, nor does it have an easy place to stow away.

- The camper seems pretty solidly built, though there does appear to be a little bit of wonkiness when you try to close up everything, as the back half seems to want to be shifted slightly left or right of centerline.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

1. i can buy many of this, and give them away as birthday or christmas gifts to kids without worrying whether they will like it because i know they will.

2. it is the first camper since the 90s - if i am not wrong. it really reminds me of that camper in the set 6388 from the 80s.

3. the size of the camper is quite alright (slightly 17-stud long and 6-stud wide) but it packs a lot of details and accessories.

3. the return of car doors! all vans in my collection from recent years do not have car doors.

4. excellent and universally-appealing design - it's not just for the boys.

4. accessories include: a wall TV set, a red mug, 2 yellow removable chairs, a grey fish, a black pan, a yellow surfing board, a red bike, etc - all the things u need in a camper.

5. the camper opens up along the middle cross-section for easier access, which is cool! previously, these campers have removable or hinged roofs.

6. the use of stickers is optional, so the stickers are good.

7. there are 2 mini-figures: the girl has nice long dark wavy hair and a new torso; the boy, on the other hand, is nothing special.

With having more than 300 Sets this is one of my all time favorites and I'm not a giant Lego City vehicle fan.

This set has so many features, lots of rare and usefull parts. You definitely won't regret buying this set. Lego really did a great job with this set.

The only minor complain I have is the small hole between the front mudguards and the indicators but it can be fixed with extra 1x1 plates from your Lego boxes to get it closed.

And to all those sticker haters: Use a sharp knife or better a cutter to get the stickers off the sheet and place them from the tip of your cutter on the model.
So you don't have to touch the stickers anymore.
Benefit: It's way easier to fix all your stickers accurate on the model, they sit perfect and half the battle is you don't have them on your left fingertip, then on the right fingertip, then on the thumb....and later the stickers come off from your model. Just try it!
Hope this helps many of you lego builders for this great model and all your future LEGO sets.

"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-12-28T13:46:27.84Z","Nice camper, about time!","As I mentioned before, Lego did not really focus on releasing these kinds of sets for a very long time. The last camper was released over 15 years ago (6351 Surf n' Sail Camper). Nowadays it's mostly police, fire, and construction. This set is a nice change, and nicely done as well.

Pros:
-Camper is sleek, durable, and has a really thick hull for its body. It could be bulletproof.
-There are 2 cups, pan, TV, surfboard, bicycle, portable grill, fish, and 2 minifigures
-There is a crawl space that allows access between the cab and living area
-There is a sleeping area right below the wind deflector (large white piece)
-Ladder at the back allows access to the roof in case you want to get the surfboard or bicycle
-Back opens to allow access to interior. A clip and pin prevent the back from swinging open when the camper is moving
-Nice lime green outlines
-Opening doors for cab! An idea that Lego has abandoned for over 10 years!

Cons:
-No side mirrors
-Grill is not built in to the camper
-Nowhere to put the fish

Overall great set and great deal at $17.99 CDN. I suggest you get it whenever you see, because who knows, the next camper might not be released for another 15 years!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The surf board and Bicycle are standard but nevertheless very appeciated extras! The set even includes a small portable stove with a fish to fry, unfortunately though this has to be stored while our lego friends are driving along.

Room for sleeping quarters is suggested but I can't imagine it's very comfortable on the floor and without a mattress!

Two Minifigures which include Surfer guy and a girl with shiny new hairdo. 

Accessories: Bike, Surfboard, Barbecue, great new fish, frying pan, portable table and chairs, two red coffee mugs and TV!

Storage: All the accessories fit perfect into this handy camper. The surfboard and bike fit neatly on top (at first I had some confusion on how the bike fits on but if you don't figure it out at first, you'll figure it out within the first day). frying pan and one mug go on the wall and another mug on the table. you can conveniently fit the barbecue and fish behind the farthest backseat in the extra space between it and the wall. 

Camper: The camper has nice front doors and front seat; spacious enough to sit four people during travel (one in front, two in back, and one in the top front sleeping quarters). Can fit two people to sleep in (one up in the top front again, and another, if the table is removed, to sleep in the back on the floor). 

Build: Perfect for an first or early set because the build it very easy (and fun). But it is also great for experienced builders. 

Playability: Great playability; like I said, great first or early set because you can do a lot with this set. (It is fun to add minifigures form the 2009 'City Minifigure Collection' like the surfer girl with the boom box to have a dance party/BBQ)

"Sammael","2009-11-14T13:44:37.95Z","Very nice, but needs a few more features.","I bought 7639 a couple of days ago, together with 7641; it took me about 20 minutes to build, and it was an easy build (as expected).

The colors (white with lime green highlights) work very well together. The construction is fairly sturdy, although the two halves tend to be a bit flimsy if not secured with the handle. 

There are quite a few stickers, but they aren't too obtrusive. Still, printed parts would have been a lot nicer.

Proportions are fairly good, although the vehicle is a bit too tall (slightly taller than the bus from 7641).

Vehicle doors are included, which is always nice. Unfortunately, there is only one seat in the front, and no rear-view mirrors (which I've come to expect on modern Lego vehicles).

There are plenty of accessories, including the TV (sticker on 2x2 tile), 2 cups, frying pan, fish, surfboard, and bicycle. I'm not sure why they didn't include any 1x1 trans-clear round plates for the bicycle headlight, though.

There are two minifigs, a fairly plain-looking male and a very nice new female.

The opening mechanism is not realistic, but it does increase playability. 

One thing that bothers me is that it's a 6-wide vehicle, yet it has more or less the same exact features as my 4-wide 6590 Vacation Camper from 1988. It would have been nice to include a fold-up bed, a sink (6590 has a faucet), a fridge, or at least a place to store the portable grill.

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-09-02T04:06:31.437Z","A Weekend Away…","As soon as this set was released earlier this year it was high on my list.   There were a lot of imports moving through eBay for three or four times the price which this set is now and although tempted, I resisted and waited until they were available on the high street.   I tried a number of times in Toys ‘R’ Us and other outlets without success, I also tried Argos and was also out of luck there too.   I actually found my set at the Trafford Centre and for a great price, slightly less than the RRP.   I really enjoyed putting this set together and I feel it is a real return to the older sets which Lego brought out in the older days (6351 / 6388 / 6694 / 6590).

The set includes the camper van, a trendy young couple complete with their barbecue (and fish) and items for their sporting activities such as a surfboard and a bicycle.   The camper van is extremely robust and comes with tinted windows and a wide cab.   Sadly, this only seats on minifig, but does feature opening doors.   There is the provision of an overcab sleeping area for one minifig while the other can sleep in the rear of the vehicle.   The sides of the camper open outwards to reveal a small dinette for two minifigs, a colour television (plasma I think) and hooks for the storage of cooking utensils.   There are also two coffee (or tea) cups.   There are ladders attached to the rear panel of the van which allow access to the rooftop, where the surfboard and bicycle can be stored while the vehicle is moving.   The rear flood lights which are attached to the rear panel of the camper clip into place so that the van remains in a ‘closed’ position when being moved.   There is also a rear step, number plates and lime green stripe, with associated graphics and amber marker lights.

I think this is going to inspire me to build a large camper van or motorhome, more on the scale of a Winnebago, but adopting the principles and design of this little set.

The 7639 'Camper' is a solid build - ideal for both small and large hands, but also packed with fantastic playability value. I have noticed over recent years that, after short blip, the LEGO City sets have improved dramatically and now reflect a more balanced vision of the world around us and interesting build techniques (with fewer 'special' pieces). This camper van makes a suitable addition to any city because it is self-contained, meaning that our two travellers can put all their gear on top or inside the vehicle, and you're not going to lose any pieces.<br><br>The lady's hair piece is fantastic too, and I doubt any fan will say no to a good bicycle! In fact, the only negative I can draw up is that, although a fish is included for cooking on the small gas stove, we have no idea how the fish was acquired... Since the two figures are travelling, we would assumed that at some point they actually went fishing, but if such as the case then why not include a nice fishing rod?<br><br>Regardless, this an excellent set all round and certainly one of the best City products in a long time. It has been discontinued now, so get it before the price sky rockets!</span>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4

I really like the way the the doors open up at the back to a sitting are and a bunk bead at the top. The bike is really cool, the minifigures can sit on it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Overall this is a sturdy set the I would really suggest buying.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-14T12:41:15.953Z","We're Going Camping!","<p>Set #7639 Camper: Recently the Real Canadian Superstore had this marked down to 9.94$ so I finally picked this set up and at a bargain price. But even at full price this set is a worthy addition to your LEGO City collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Camper is built in two stages, complete with bags marked 1 and 2, step 1 involves building the lower half of the camper, the wheels and drivers compartment. The second step involves constructing both sides of the upper section, which click together and are on hinged pieces to open up for play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Camper model is great, it looks absolutely perfect, there was a bit of confusion with one point where I thought I was missing some orange lights because the color in the instructions during that step of the build is misleading, but it was actually the red lights that do go there. Stickers are used for details, markings on the outside of the camper, the tree logo, the two stripes and of course the license plates front and back. Inside there is only one sticker detail, the screen for the television.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are a brilliant blend of new pieces and old, it's been a while since I've seen that particular male torso and I'm glad to have it back in my Mini-Figure collection with this set. There are the following accessories, a fish with a small built grill, two red mugs, the surfboard and the bicycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it's all put together this set is really impressive, and what's more the Camper is perfectly to scale with other vehicles in LEGO City, let me explain this by describing how my display is currently set up. I've got the Small Car and Mini-Dumper sets side by side, the Sports Car from my Sports Car set then the Camper and last, but not least the Front-End Loader all lined up in a row from smallest to largest. I was actually surprised when I saw that the Camper, despite costing more and coming in a larger box, is actually a bit shorter than my Front-End Loader, which consists of less pieces and costs less. I'm not usually one to care about scale in LEGO, but in this case it serves this set well when combined with other LEGO City sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall LEGO City Camper is an excellent little set and a worthy addition to your LEGO City display, I'm thinking it'll look great next to the Creator Log Cabin (once I pick that set up I plan on putting it beside it.) to complete a nice little camping scene. I can't recommend this set enough, the build is modular and easy to follow (aside from those small 1X1 lights I mentioned earlier.), the Mini-Figures are great and the price is just right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some might not like the fact that the interior looks a little bear or that the grill is so tiny and not an actual barbeque, but in all honesty if the grill was larger it wouldn't fit inside for storage. The Camper is great, buy it.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

<ul>
<li></strong>I have always been a big fan of the city themed trailers and campers.&nbsp; This one is an improvement on the models I played with in the late 80s and early 90s.&nbsp; You get a decent amount of pieces for the price.&nbsp; The six-stud wide frame base plate is nice, as&nbsp;it better&nbsp;reflects the scale of a trailer and mini-figure.&nbsp; Most cars have a four-stud wide frame base plate, so a trailer should have a wider one.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not overly impressed by the designs of the mini-figures and I thought that that two sliding doors were not held together by very much. Otherwise, though, it is visually impressive set with nice extras like a bicycle and surfboard. In my opinion, a good deal is one in which the pieces cost 10.00c or less, so at 10.297c per piece, this one only rates 4/5.</li></ul>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4

The design is fairly simple yet it works and the level of detailing is just right. There are 3 windows, 2 at the back and&nbsp;the big one at the front. The surf board and bike on top are nice touches.&nbsp;Inside there is 2 chairs and a table also a frying pan and BBQ are clipped onto the walls.
