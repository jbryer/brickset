"LuvKernow","2009-05-02T14:13:28.937Z","The doors on the bus are wrong, wrong, wrong...","Just bought this set in my local TRU today, built it in next to no time (It's a very basic build! No real innovations!) 

For me, the thing that really ruins this set, and is a source of great disappointment, is the doors on the bus! I've seen some great MOCs of buses using very innovative techniques in making the doors swing out like proper buses do. Surely Lego themselves could've thought of something better than what we got here? 

At least some of the other parts of the set raised a smile, like the new design of the pizza oven...

"Teez","2009-06-06T02:06:15.873Z","Neat set a great addition to any Lego city","This set took me a couple of hours to build. It's straight-forward and simple to assemble; no fancy construction techniques here! Overall City Corner is attractive and makes for a perfect fit in nearly any (modern) Lego city. The set is comprised of the following components:

- Minifigs: Five are in the box including a female chef plus male mechanic, bus driver, passenger and a boy (on a skateboard).

- Bus Stop: A simple layout with some nice details (a fire hydrant, potted plant, trash can and lamp post). My only complaint here is the bench is only one stud deep; it probably should have been two.

- Bus: A large-scale bus that can seat up to 6 minifigs! I agree with other reviewers that the doors could have been better, but they're OK as is. The rear bumper and front fascia incorporate the new Lego look for vehicles and is quite attractive. There are stickers that advertise the two buildings in this set along with Octan (Lego petroleum brand). Unlike other recent Lego vehicles this bus doesn't have a license plate. Strange as there's plenty of room for one...

- Bike Shop & Repair: Nice little shop although the interior is rather plain. It does, however, contain a display section that exhibits a skateboard, cap and helmet. There's also a tool rack in there plus a bicycle. The exterior more than makes up for the paucity of detail on the inside. The shop sign is particularly handsome and the surveillance camera is a really nice touch.

- Pizzeria: This building has three floor although the top level is bare. The ground floor contains a really neat oven that opens with a lever and a countertop with a small cash register and place for a pizza. The second floor houses two small tables and four chairs for patrons.

City Corner makes a great addition to any Lego city and can provide hours of fun for kids. There's not much to complain about other than the price; given the brick count this set is overpriced in my opinion. 

Design: 6/10 - nothing innovative here
Appearance: 9/10 - looks great

"HQuiff","2009-06-29T07:01:40.593Z","So Elegantly Done ","It was on the 27th of June this year that I picked this absolutely astonishing set form my local ToyMaster. I didn't even think this would be released in Ireland for another view weeks. But in any case, I've got it and it was well worth €49.99, believe me.


Bus Stop - 9/10. A nice an easy build, however rewarding. This Bus Stop features handy accessories that can be placed anywhere in your town, such as a Fire hydrant, a bin, and a pot with a white flowers in.
The actual place where the Minifigs can sit can only fit one person, though thanks to the shelter roof being so large, it means on a wet day other people can stand under it. ;)


Bus - 10/10. A masterfully crafted beautiful vehicle. Maybe the best vehicle in LEGO History. In any town or City you always need a bus, so why not count on the old reliable 244 Bus? It can seat 6 People, plus the others who are so desperate to get to work they'd stand.
The build here is simple yet fun. It'll definitely give any AFOL, TFOL, or even a KFOL some fun to do. 
The detail here is also good, and surprisingly for once, the stickers are actually good (Don't attack me for saying that). They're small, though they act as great advertising thingys that you'd probably see on any old bus. 
Finally we come to it's roof, a nice simply done roof with nice details, plus it can lift off! Hurrah!
Oh, and the doors by the way are grand, I don't know what everyone else are complaining about!


Bike Shop - 8/10. This amount of pieces used here is actually less then teh bus, but it's put as the third biggest? {:[ <---- Confused smiley 
However, the Bike plus Skateboard Shop is a good addition to anywhere, and though the inside is small, it makes up for this with a great outside. But before I talk about the outside looks, ETC. I want to talk about the interior.
OK, well inside we have a nice little display part, showing a red cap, a skateboard helmet, and a skateboard (The skateboard mind sometime falls back when you accidently knock it with your elbow). There's also a little place for tools!
Right, now onto the exterior. Well once again the stickers are used nicely (For the sign, number, ETC.) like they did on the Bus, plus it adds to the general look of it. The roof it's self can lift off quite simply, and there's a camara on it.
BTW, there's also a nice street light like at the Bus stop. ;)


The Pizzeria - 9/10. What can I say? Fantastic will probably do. Here we see a three storey building, all floors can lift off like the Bike shop and the Bus. The build, was nice and easy, with some nice designs.
The interior is lovely! The bottom floor features a lovely oven, that with a flick of lever can open it and send the pizza flying out! Also on this floor we have a nice counter with a tile type thing on it. Plus room for people to get orders. :)
The second floor is also very pretty. Here we have two tables, with two yellow seats each. The tables can fit one Pizza, or four glasses (You only get two in the set however). Also on this floor we have opening windows! Three of them to be exact. XD
Finally onto the third floor, we we have a nice roof and two nice new windows, though we have nothing up here strangely enough! So I added some boxes and a mouse, I mean what shop in ANY LEGO City can boast about being completely rat or mouse free? 


The Minifigs - 9/10. LEGO City has never offered great Minifigs, and if they have, they only have the ones with the same usual heads! Though in this set, we have Pepper-Roni (We haven't seen him in a while), though this time with small gray trousers, one of those cool madly grinning business people who's waiting for the old 244, the chef minifig (I thought this head was going to be like all the other female heads, though here with see bright red lipstick), the repair man with his overalls, and the bus driver, who has a NEW suit body, and I do mean new, because on this one, we have more detail, believe me.


Overall - 9.8/10. One of the best sets released (The Town Plan is still better) up-to-date. I would recommend this as a must have to all City fans, and in general a set you should get. The price to piece ratio is actually quite good considering how little amount of pieces we get now days in LEGO® sets.

"johnny_t","2009-05-21T04:18:34.793Z","A must have for any true AFOL!","  I was amazed that I found this set at my local Las Vegas ToysRUs. Expecting it to be closer to $100, I got an additional shock when I saw the TRU price to only be $60. I forked over the cash and had the set completed within a couple of hours. 

     First off, I have to say that I'm extremely happy to finally be adding something else to my LEGO city besides emergency and construction themes. The civilian idea for this set makes it automatically a must have. 

     The buildings are wonderful. They add the perfect amount of realism to the set. You can get more uses out of the set this way, rather than if it had only been the bus. People say they don't like the way that their not ""complete"" buildings because of the missing wall. WHY? They're LEGO buildings, and they fit perfectly into the LEGO world. I love sets like Cafe Corner and Green Grocer, but come on, it keeps the set price reasonable, and you can always add the extra walls yourself. 

     The bus is spectacular! Perfect size for the first ""real"" bus from LEGO. Yeah, LEGO could of toyed around with some different ideas for the doors, but it's a great vehicle all the same. Some may find the stickers too much, but I don't mind stickers. It looks good with or without them.

I'm really not a huge fan of the modular building system. It makes the build seem to fly by. But of course, that's one of the down sides to being an AFOL. I guess LEGO has got to keep the youngsters in mind too. 

Pros:

- great mini figures
- nice assortment of buildings
- huge bus 
- new window parts 
- not really a bad price for everything you get 

Cons:

- none for me

"aplbomr","2009-12-26T00:20:28.687Z","My boys' first Lego Set","Santa delivered this one on Christmas Day.  My boys were excited as was I.  This was the first Lego set that I had put together in some time - nearly a decade!  I was not disappointed.

This is a great starter set for City.  The best part of the set is definitely the bus, it was the most well thought out of all the components.  It is very well built and rugged enough to handle a 2 & 3 year old to play with without breaking apart.  The designers obviously started with this model in mind and then went from there.

The skate and bike shop is very reminiscent of the old Cycle Fix-It Shop (6699; 1987).   This component brought back a lot of great memories for me.  The security camera is a great addition and adds some reality.  It is also a nice touch to include a street lamp, bike, two skateboards, 2 helmets, a mechanic, and a youth mini-fig.

The Pizza Shop also has some nice touches such as the pizza oven and 2.5 levels (I assume the top .5 level is to be storage).

The bus station is simple enough, but again has some nice features such as the fire hydrant and another streetlamp.

As well designed as the bus is, the rest of the set was not as well designed.  Yes, the buildings are mostly modular and include some larger building pieces that are not greatly suited for transference into imaginative building. However, there are enough small building pieces that balance this negative out.

What I do like about this set is that the components are freestanding and not connected on a large building plate.  This allows for innumerable City design capabilities.

This is a great set!

Santa also included the Tow Truck (7638), the Sports Car (8402), and the BBQ Stand (8398) as stocking stuffers.  These sets are a great start to my boys' City collection.  If you were to buy all of them at once, you would be out of pocket for less than $90 - and that includes 8 mini-figs, 3 vehicles, and three buildings.

"lotographia","2009-07-05T21:21:47.75Z","Nice buildings and accessories, not very interesting walls of minifigs.","I love this - a city set that ISN'T a fire station or a police station or a hospital! Instead, it's some buildings that make my city into an actual city rather than some kind of emergency state. The novelty of this earns this set four of five stars by itself.

The amount of possibilities in this set is wonderful. The bus has five seats, not counting the bus driver. The pizza restaurant has four seats upstairs with two cups and two pizzas. There are two skateboards and a bicycle. There's a spare hat and a helmet. The three structures can be arranged any way you want. There are flowers, a trash can, a fire hydrant and a CCTV camera. This set really does make my city come to life.

There is one down side to this set though, and this is the walls of the buildings. Traditionally walls should be made up of layers of interlocking bricks, but the walls on these buildings are just one large piece. It's a little disappointing and I think worth marking down for. Also, the bicycle shop seems kind of insubstantial, with only two walls and a pillar. Another thing I don't really like is that none of the minifig torsos or heads are new, they've all been used before. The new Indiana Jones sets got heaps of new torsos and heads, so why couldn't this city set with five minifigs? It's a little disappointing.

Nonetheless I recommend this addition to any city.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AlterBrick__Vienna__Austria","2009-08-11T19:25:54.75Z","Bus & Pizza rule around the world","
OK - let's start with the top-topic: Stickers!
In this set you need to put on some of them, but not all.

The bus is cooler with less advertisment. So leave those stickers away - can be added later.

Anyways - the bus is the star: Which LEGO-City could do without a bus? I can clearly hear the  diesel-engine and the sound of the door-opener. It has so realistic proportions and is quite heavy.
Unfortunately LEGO-City in fact had to do without a bus up to now since decades. So that is all new. 
They even made new windscreen-bricks, unique in this set at present and you get it 3x (1 in the bus stop)!

The pizza restaurant is ok. The oven-opener is fun. In mine there was spare paddle - so I can built a rowing boat and sell it in the sports-shop next door ;-)
You get 2 pizzas which are rare. They are needed urgently in LEGO-City or what do you think, how the inhabitants can keep up their healthy yellow tan?
New roof windows which are still very rare (only  available in 2 sets at present) and here unique in black.

Finally the little sports shop. Nice idea. I'm sure, most people have some parts and goods to ""pimp it up"" or customize it as we said in former times. I see that as a start equipment to build a bigger store.

The slim, modern street lights, the hydrant and the boy on the skateboard make every LEGO-city more vivid!

Playability? Huge! Although there are no emergency besides ""hurry to catch the bus"" or ""It's pizza time!"" ;-)

So: A full recommendation as a gift, wish or buy.

50€ is much, but there are already offers at only 42€ around.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-11-01T06:31:29.843Z","Lots To See and Do at City Corner…","I first saw this set earlier in the year in Bart Smit, which is a toy shop in Bruges.   I immediately thought how reminiscent it was of the city I was visiting; the three storey building which houses the pizza restaurant, the bike repair shop (lots of bicycles there) and of course the bus.   Although the buses which ‘fly’ around Bruges are more grey in colour, they do share the white and yellow colour scheme which the bus in this set has.   Although I didn’t buy this set there in Bruges, every time I have seen it since it has always reminded me of the city and the wonderful time I spent there, so that was motivation enough to add it to the collection, and to quote ‘HQuiff’ this set is “so elegantly done” and I spent a very pleasant Halloween evening constructing it.   The set is quite large, so here is another large review.

The set is split into five separate parts:

The Bus Stop:

I decided to put this together first, and it was a really pleasant build.   The bus stop is built up on its own base plate, and although the build is simple, when the set is built this area is so effective.   The shelter arrangement features a slim red seat which the minifigs can either perch on or lean against; this area is covered by a blue canopy and is supported by a simple white column which has an amber light.   On the roof of this structure is the transportation sign (sticker).   Back on ground level, there is a sign post with bus graphic, but no timetable :o(   Other items which decorate this area are a dustbin with lid. a small brown planter with flowers and a fire hydrant (I didn’t see any of these in Bruges!).   Also we have a very modern-in-appearance street light, no ornate lanterns here just a slim grey affair which is very effective.

The Bicycle Repair Shop:

Shop Number ‘1’ is the Bicycle Repair Shop.   This, like the bus stop is built upwards on its own ground plate.   This was a simple yet enjoyable build, the shop is black and white and features a large picture window which looks out onto the street, adjacent to this is a large open access door area where bicycles and skateboards can be ‘rode’ straight in.   On display in the shop (visible through the window) is a skateboard on a rack, baseball cap and safety helmet on blue posts.   There is also a rail which holds two tool items for the mechanic to use.   Mounted on to the top of this small building is a multi-adjustable CCTV system, a large sign advertising the products / services available and two floodlights to ‘light’ up the sign.   Back on street level, there is another modern lamp post which mirrors the one supplied with the bus stop.

The Pizza Restaurant:

Shop Number ‘2’ is the Pizza Restaurant.   Again, this is built on its own base plate, incidentally, there are no ‘connectors’ supplied with this set so as to enable the three structures to be linked together, they would be easily found in the spares box though.   The ground floor area features the front door, small waiting area, counter (with telephone) and the kitchen with oversized pizza oven and paddle for retrieving the pizzas from the back of the oven.   The oven features a Technic mini-build which provides a handle to open the oven which is glass-fronted.   The first floor is the restaurant.   Just two tables and four seats are provided, as are two transparent goblets.   The interior is pretty basic, so a degree of customisation can take place.   The exterior includes a bay window and rails, window boxes would have been welcome here.   The second (top) floor is like a dormer, and is void of any items at all.   The exterior really completes this building perfectly, slanted windows and a tower with balcony rail and two long windows.   On the top of the roof, at either end of the building, are chimneys.   I am unsure what to do with this area; it seems a shame to have it stood empty, especially when space in Lego City is at a premium!   I have thought about making it into a penthouse for the businessman supplied with the set.   With the clever use of some flat pieces, all additional floors can be lifted off each other so that access can be gained more easily into the lower floors.

The Bus ‘244’:

I can honestly say that this is the first Lego bus I have ever owned, I am sure we all experimented with our spare pieces to try to construct a bus, I for one could never get it quite right, so the bus in this set is really welcome, and it’s a superb piece of kit.   It has quite a long wheelbase and initially it is constructed in three sections, then the real overall length becomes apparent when it is time to connect the three sections together.   The bus follows the grey, yellow and white colour scheme; it also has yellow wheel arches.   The bus features six red seats, although one of these is for the driver, realistically five seated passengers can be carried, along with others who have to stand.   I particularly like the yellow ‘line’ just behind the driver’s seat, is this the point you must not cross as you may risk distracting the driver?   The driver’s area is very simple with room for boarding / disembarkation of passengers.   Smoked grey windows and windscreen complete the modern look of the vehicle.   Above the windows are white boards which advertise various businesses in the city (Octan, Pizza Restaurant, the Transport Company and the Bicycle Repair Shop) the route number (244) is also shown.   The roof is split into two removable sections so that access can be had to the interior.   Large opening doors, front and rear bumpers and adjustable wing mirrors make this bus a winning set, it’s taken Lego a while to release a bus, but in my opinion it was worth the wait.

The Minifigs and Accessories:

There are five minifigs supplied with this set.   There is a female chef with chef whites, neckerchief and designer hairstyle (tut tut no hat).   The bus driver is dressed in his smart black uniform with peak cap; the print on the torso was very faint though.   The businessman looks to be wearing a cardigan; either that or he has been for a round of golf, he comes with a brown attaché case.   The mechanic is wearing green overalls and a blue baseball cap; he comes with various tools also.   The strangest minfig with the set is the young boy with the safety helmet on.   This is the first ‘child’ minifig I have received with a set, and I’m not sure about it!   He has the same torso as the ‘older’ minifigs but he has really short legs, in fact he can’t sit down as the legs don’t bend.   Other than that he has a cheeky grin and ginger hair, and of course his skateboard.   

Well I did warn it would be a long review, I’m really pleased to have this in my collection, it is all “so elegantly done” and although modern in appearance it reminds me of how Lego City was when I first started collecting it all those years back.   Well done Lego, more of the same please for 2010 / 2011 and beyond…",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-12-27T15:37:27.95Z","Great set!","I like this set because it represents a part of a busy city. It is a big relief from all the police and fire themed sets (in fact, Lego already launched yet another fire station 7208!). Included are a pizzeria, bike shop, bus stop, bus, and minifigures to go along with them.

The first build is the bus stop. Here, you get a bus shelter, bus sign, fire hydrant, street light, garbage can, and flower pot, great accessories to add to other parts of your city. The bus shelter has a seat only 1 stud deep but this not an issue. After all, some people prefer to stand waiting for the bus!

The next build is the bus, the first ever released in Lego history. At first glance, I thought it was quite small, however, when built, it's as long as a roadplate! The sleek design gives it a modern look, complete with new 1x3x6 windows. There are 5 seats for passengers excluding driver, however, it can fit up to 7-8 people provided there are standees. The doors are ingenious contrary to what some might think. There are advertisements for Transport, Octan, Pizza, and the Bike Shop. The driver sure looks like a cop, wonder if he's undercover... A civilian is included waiting for the bus.

The next build is the bike shop. It is very simple as three 1x6x5 panels make up the walls and window, and a 6x16 plate for the roof. However, the roof is quite detailed, with a sign and lights, security camera, and a flag with a bike on it, with a red trim finish. The interior has a skateboard display, and cap and helmet, plus tools for repairs. I understand that not having a door is an issue for many people, however, it makes sense because people will need space to push their bike into the shop. A street light stands in front of the bike shop. A worker in green overalls and kid with skateboard are included.

The final build is the three-storey (includes attic) pizzeria. I like how this restaurant is a house. The first floor has a counter with cash register, and a large pizza oven against the wall. 2 pizzas are included (Thank goodness they aren't stickers!). The concept for how to work the oven is you have to turn the lever and a round pin will push open the glass. Unfortunately, the pizza doesn't fly out like I wanted it to. A pizza flipper and a spare are included. A female chef works here. The second floor is where patrons can dine. I was extremely disappointed with the tables; they are simply round 2x2 bricks! However, this can easily be solved. There are four chairs and two tables with one cup on each. The attic is completely empty, making it a great place for storage.

Overall this is a great set and makes a great addition to your Lego city. In my opinion, road plates should've been included in this set, however, it doesn't really matter. At $79.99 CDN, I'd say the price is reasonable. I suggest you get this set before the flood of fire sets begin swarming you next year!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

But enough about me and more on the review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Review...</h4>
<p>I didn't really notice that my minifigures couldn't sit at the bus stop until a while after we finished building it. It's not much of a disadvantage because they can still stand. I noticed that it was hard to seat a person on the first seat of the bus because of the window there. If you have this set, you will understand. If you are ordering this set, you will soon find out. But it was easier to place people on the other seats, or even on the roof on crowded days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pizza parlor was a nice part of this set. It even comes with a pizza maker, but it's so close to the front desk and the lady working there, you can't really squeeze it in there. You just have to use your imagination. The upstairs made the place look slightly fancy with the tall glasses at each table. I like the look of that. And the small attic above it is where I store all the money they make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sports shop was cool. There&nbsp;are two&nbsp;skateboards, one on display, the other is being used by&nbsp;a little boy. Its nice that they come with helmets. Even your minifigures must have safety, just in case the hospital is too far away. Too bad I don't have a hospital...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice set, really. Despite the 2 small things that I found wrong with it, it's a decent set and worth my money that took me ever so long to save up. It's cool.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"AETerry","2010-09-07T16:49:58.503Z","City Corner Review","<p>With so much of a&nbsp; Town or City collection seeming to be mainly Police, Fire, Medical and Construction sets, the City Corner is a highly welcomed addition. It is nigh close to perfect with providing a down town merchant area and bus stop to help flesh out a Town/City theme.<br></p><p>At $59.99 it's almost a very good pricing, one I'm willing to over look as it's just a bit steep. More so since there's so much going on with this set and can be done for play or even display.</p><h4>Instructions</h4><p>As this set is modular, you've got three different instruction booklets for each part of the build. All follow LEGO's format of step-by-step illustrations, followed up by a parts list at the back of the Pizzeria booklet for the off chance replacement pieces are needed.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 483 pieces in all with several distinct and unique pieces that add character to the down town area of a trash can, flowers, skate board, bike, pizza tiles and the like. There are also stickers that come with this set, so be forewarned for those who dislike them.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are five minifigures in all. A bus driver, commuter, kid on skate board, Bicycle Repair man and the Pizzeria Worker. All are decently detailed and do the job.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>As stated before, the set is modular and is built and several stages depicting another element and feature of a Down Town district for a LEGO City.</p><p>1st) Bicycle Repair Shop - I've a couple of older Shop sets from the 80's for Motorcycles, this is the first shop I've seen to feature the skateboards. There's also a security camera and a street light on this build and I am really liking those for a City layout.</p><p>2nd) Pizzeria - While LEGO has done many stand alone Pizzeria sets over the years, it does pay to revisit this idea every few years as there is always going to be new kids coming in to collect LEGO and even older Collectors may have missed out on a set. Plus, pizza is a good staple and favorite. I love the oven build inside the restaurant and the sitting up stairs.</p><p>3rd) Bus - A must for any decent sized Town or City. It even has lots of advertisement (stickers) on its side as it drives through the streets. The seating inside the bus isn't all that great as there are some red tiled/brick areas that barely qualify as proper seating on a bus. Still, the whole of the set does the job well. <br></p><p>4th) Bus Stop - Here, you have a commuter waiting for the bus. There's lots of little accent pieces to this one with a route schedule, trash can, flowers for city beautification, fire hydrant. The Bus Stop shelter though doesn't seem fully realized as there's just a narrow red tile sticking out for a minifigure to sit on, just barely. There's another street light on this mini-build and really brings out a more modern LEGO City.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>To me, this is a must have, essential set to get if you're going to try and build a LEGO Town or City with your collection. There's places for minifigures to go and do things. While I've been around long enough to collect, yeah these sets are a new variation of what's been done before, they still add character to a City. Hopefully if LEGO pursues the idea of developing more sets for a City, we'll see places like a Music Shop or Jewelry store, providing more places of business and commerce that don't always center around Public Works and Emergency Personnel.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4
"av8r1973","2011-01-05T12:20:41.03Z","Great bus - nice storefronts - near perfect all around kit","<p>This kit is a great set within a City layout or just as a standalone set.&nbsp; The set contains four separate elements.&nbsp; A great bus, a bus stop, a pizza restaurant, and a skate/bike shop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the bus.&nbsp; A nicely sized city bus with near perfect proportions.&nbsp; The seating arrangements, door locations and windows are very realistic.&nbsp; The chassis and front and rear facias were fun to build.&nbsp; The colors and integration of ""pinstripes"" were clever.&nbsp; My only complaint is I believe they used the wrong size tire/wheel combination.&nbsp; These are little tires.&nbsp; For a bus, the scale doesn't look right.&nbsp; A taller set would have been nice.&nbsp; Of course, that means the fenders would have to be enlarged, too, but most buses don't really even have fenders.&nbsp; Minor gripe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bus stop looks just like a real one.&nbsp; Integration of a streetlight, flower planter, trashcan, fire hydrant and bus sign are well done on a standalone plate that can go anywhere in your city.&nbsp; Yes, the seat isn't big enough for folks to sit down, but it can be thought of as a leaning rail.&nbsp; Nice colors, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pizza restaurant was fun to build.&nbsp; I like the inset door, door mats and floor-to-ceiling windows.&nbsp; The upstairs dining area is typical of urban restaurants, so that was a nice touch, too.&nbsp; The pizza oven was fun.&nbsp; I opened and closed the oven many times just because.&nbsp; Cool.&nbsp; The tables could have been a little better thought out, but...minor gripe.&nbsp; The roof was also fun with the gable in the middle.&nbsp; Not too many roof pieces, but the overall look adds variety to the city houses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The skate/bike shop looks great.&nbsp; Signage everywhere and another streetlamp.&nbsp; Goods for sale, my first bicycle and a service shop ready for action are great.&nbsp; The security camera was a nice touch that wasn't necessary, but was fun to build.&nbsp; It shows the genuine thought and fun behind this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are stickers in this set.&nbsp; A lot of them.&nbsp; That is offset by the great minifigs!&nbsp; Five of them!&nbsp; The pizza chef looks great (female, too!), skater boy with the red hair, short legs&nbsp;and helmet, the mechanic, bus driver and passenger.&nbsp; The passenger has the same body as the SUV and Horse Trailer set, but a different head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the best part of the whole set is that the buildings are completely interchangeable and compatible with the City House and the Construction sets.&nbsp; The floors are all modular, so you can mix and match house and building parts as your city deems necessary.&nbsp; I am glad the thought process spanned several kits (we have all of them now).&nbsp; They all go very well together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one is worth the money and isn't like any other kit available or in the past.&nbsp; It's worth the money.&nbsp; We found it on substantial sale here in Taiwan and scooped it up.&nbsp; Don't pass on it.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

Christmas, and I thought about it for a really long time. Finally, I 
decided I'd get the City Corner, and I didn't regret it.<br><br>This set is 
really cool and includes a skate and bike shop, a pizzeria, and a bus 
and bus stop. It has numbered bags, which are helpful, and the play 
experience is unlimited. Here's a brief description of each part and 
then the pros and cons.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bus:</span> The bus is a good part to this set and 
really livens it up. There are 5 seats for the passengers and one for 
the driver. You can take the top off, and really adds to the city well.<br>Bus
 Stop: The bus stop is a small but good section of this set, and has 
some cool parts like a fire hydrant, a trash can, and some flowers. The 
person waiting for the bus can sit down while they're waiting, or go to 
the pizzeria or shop. The bus doesn't have much places to go to with 
only one bus stop in your city, so you're better off to make a couple of
 your own.<br>Pizzeria: The pizzeria is a really good part of this set. 
It as three floors, though the top one is bare. On the first floor you 
can order your pizza. There's a cash register and a cool oven that opens
 with a lever. On the second floor there's space for the customers to 
eat, however I think the pizzeria doesn't have a lot of detail (but you 
can look at the bottom of this review to find ways to add to this set). 
Overall, the pizzeria is a good part of this set.<br>Skate and Bike 
Shop: This shop has cool parts like a display section, two repair tools,
 and a bike, but lacks detail, and I added a lot to this part too. It 
has an really handsome sign and surveillance camera, though, and it's 
pretty good.<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>Minifigures:</span> This set is really good when it comes to 
minifigure, and they all have different (and cool!) faces. This set 
comes with a little boy an his skateboard, the pizzeria owner, the Skate
 and Bike shop owner, the bus driver, and a passenger on the bus.<br>If 
this enough for you, get this now, but if you still want the pros and 
cons and some tips to improve this set, then keep reading.<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>Pros:</span><br>has many parts to the set<br>has two pizzas<br>has two wine glasses<br>cash register in pizzeria<br>good minifigures<br>has two skateboards<br>has one bike<br>includes an opening oven (but the oven doesn't open all the way)<br>skate and bike shop has a display section<br>bus stop has cool parts to it<br>you can take the roof off of everything (except for the bus stop)<br>there's no back to the buildings so you can play inside easily<br>skate and bike shop has a nice sign<br>skate and bike shop has a neat surveillance camera<br>can play with it a lot and doesn't get boring<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>Cons:</span><br>the baseplates are rather small, and the whole set kinda is<br>pricey<br>short legs don't move<br>lack of detail in some areas<br>oven doesn't open all the way<br>not much to do inside the bus<br><br></span>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4

"gelkster","2011-06-20T19:44:42.233Z","Hangin' out on the corner","<p>Received this for Father's Day 2011. My 2 boys are crazy into the City LEGO theme, &amp; this fit the bill nicely (I build, they play :) It reminds me of the ""Main Street"" set from 25+ yrs back, though much smaller, &amp; that set had 2 roadplates. This set contains 5 varied minifigs (our 1st ""kid"" minifig!) I like the&nbsp;buildings' look&nbsp;&amp; the big&nbsp;bus is the best&nbsp;part of the set. If you're low on chairs, this set has 7 red &amp; 4 yellow chairs! I've seen the&nbsp;fireplug in the LEGO paperback storybooks (which my boys also love). Though the buildings'&nbsp;modular design&nbsp;may be&nbsp;seen as an advantage, I chose to put it all on a roadplate; both buildings fit side-by-side nicely. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few complaints: the pizza shop is way too small- there's no room&nbsp;for the oven paddle! A&nbsp;better choice would be the smaller handheld signal paddle. The oven seemed neat in theory but wouldn't open&nbsp;properly until I glued a couple key pieces in the handle. Even then,&nbsp;it's difficult&nbsp;to get pizza in/out.&nbsp;Oddly, the skate shop has no door- maybe that's why they included a security camera....&nbsp;Also, the skateboard display stand needs another 1x1 brick for the board to stand right. Plus 2 different color skateboards/helmets would've been nice, but that's nitpicky.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All in all a good fun set to add to your LEGO City collection.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4

I thought it was too expensive for the amount of Lego you get with it. However it was quite good to build. I thought the bus was really good because of how many seats it had and the minifigures were great</p>

I have always known about LEGO’s fixation with police stations (because that’s what all the boys want, presumably, although a part of me feels that this has become a self-fulfilling prophecy since City sets are police-heavy year after year), so when I was looking around for a starting point for my own town, City Corner was the obvious choice: two small businesses, a bus stop and a bus to go with it, and a host of Minifigs to populate the town. I was not disappointed.</span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">Five Minifigs come with the set, representing a diverse selection of townspeople: a bus conductor (for the bus, obviously, and bearing a striking resemblance to the airplane pilot in 3182), a young skateboarder, a bicycle mechanic clad in a decidedly old-school design, a businessman (a perfect complement for Bank &amp; Money Transfer (7611)), and a pizza chef for the pizzeria. No complaints here: five Minifigs is perfect for a set this size.</span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">As mentioned, City Corner comes with three buildings: a bus stop, a skateboard/bicycle shop (I am not altogether with the two coexisting, but then again, I am into neither mode of transportation and perhaps have not noticed that these two things really are sold in the same shop), and a pizzeria. None of these three buildings are particularly striking, but they nonetheless contribute to a unified sense of a town which is further bolstered by City House (8403), another invaluable addition for a thriving LEGO city (because seriously, four police stations and two fire stations does not a city make). </span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">The bus stop is the smallest and simplest of the three buildings, but it serves its purpose well. The sheltered bus stop has a place for Minifigs to sit and a small open space that can be used for Minifigs to gather or to be modified as you see fit. It’s almost purely functional, but then again, it’s not as if most bus stops in real life are grand affairs either; the one outside my house takes the phrase “bus stop” almost literally, consisting of a single sign indicating that the bus does, indeed, stop there.</span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">The skateboard/bicycle shop is a single-storey affair, although just like the pizzeria and City House, it can be modified to include more floors if one desires. The garish sign and nearly-empty interior gives the whole thing a bit of a slum feel, frankly, and the security camera on the rooftop does it little favours in this regard (don’t LEGO folks get tired of being under near-constant monitoring?). It’s a simple build that allows - in fact, practically begs for - modification on the individual’s end. </span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">On the other hand, the pizzeria has three floors, with an oven and counter on the first floor, dining space on the second, and, er, absolutely nothing on the third. The oven works well, though it isn’t particularly interesting, and the second floor is as simple as it gets, with just an arrangement of chairs and tables for diners. I assume that the third floor is left empty so that Harry Caul from The Conversation can place a surveillance team there, or something. Again, like the skateboard/bicycle shop, the pizzeria is largely functional, providing a nice backdrop for your city. And let’s face it: you’ll need something to destroy when all those superhero sets come out, won’t you?</span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">The surprising jewel of this set, though - at least in my opinion - is the bus. It is actually rather big - almost as big as the Tank Truck (3180), in fact - and it features a number of details and features that really bump up the playability of this set. It complements the bus stop very well, obviously, and an easily-removable roof means that you can easily get Minifigs in and out of it, which I’m sure is a good thing for younger LEGO connoisseurs. Sadly, though, since there is only one bus stop, the bus is going to take a trip around town and stop right back at the same place, which is sure to create frustrations for commuters. But, that aside, the bus looks great, although its colour choice does puzzle me. I don’t know if there are any unifying themes for buses in Europe or in other parts of the world, but yellow on buses in the US does invoke images of school buses, an image that is particularly evocative for me since I do work in a school.</span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">All in all, while City Corner doesn’t showcase any examples of mind-blowing architecture, it provides a great urban backdrop that can serve as the seed for your LEGO town. The modularity - while possibly an annoyance to some - allows you the freedom to design the town in whatever way you see it as you expand it beyond this set. Get this together with City House and Bank &amp; Money Transfer and you have yourself a thriving town community that’s just begging to be destroyed the hostile extraterrestrials from Alien Conquest. </span></div></span>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,4
