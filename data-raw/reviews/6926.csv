"jamal_lts","2009-07-14T18:33:10.467Z","The Trucks are just too Narrow","The first thing i build was the truck. And as expected, it doesn't feel right there together with previous trucks. Currently, trucks and vehicles alike are only 6 studs wide compared to recent years sets which are 8 studs wide. 

Well it might look proportional to the Minifig, but that's because a Minifig is short. But it looks cramped when u put 2 together in a 6 stud wide vehicle.

The Garage however looks much realistic than other City sets. The build is fairly simple. What interests me the most is the rail that carry heavy loads for the mechanic. Having it really makes it feel like a garage.

I played it alongside the F1 Ferrari sets and if u just ignore the color scheme, this set makes a helpful addition to them F1 mechanics at work.

Bottomline:

Pros:

Great garage design and details. 
Its like getting a loose red truck cab
Great playability together with other city vehicles.

Cons:

Vehicles are now 6 stud wide. :-(",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-12-26T20:25:11.153Z","Great repair shop!","I think this is the first car repair centre Lego made for the first time in a while. Actually, I believe the last one was released back in 1999 (6434) but it does not even come close to competing with this one. Times have changed and lego buildings and vehicles have entered into a new era of modern design and architecture.<br><br>There are four minifigures total: two workers and two drivers.<br><br>The first thing you build is the blue pick up truck. Generally pick up trucks are massive and heavy duty, but I like how a smaller pick up truck is being given here, as it gives some sort of relief from the larger vehicles Lego sets are releasing these days. The front is completely streamlined, giving a futuristic feel to the overall design. A small amount of things can be stored on the trunk.<br><br>The next build is the red trailer cab. It has the same design as all other 6 stud wide vehicles, complete with a cup sitting above the dashbord inside in case the driver needs a break. There are 2 clips holding a fire extinguisher and a screwdriver at the rear. Blue and white stripes decorate the side of the cab. The kingpin at the back allows you to attach your own trailer onto the cab. Overall a useful addition to any city.<br><br>The next build is the monstrous tow truck. This is my favourite part of the set. The telescoping boom can raise and lower without breaking apart (only when the tow truck is completely assembled, as the necessary pieces are required to strengthen it) and it can tow vehicles of incredible size. If you feel that the boom is about to break apart, you can check using the side doors to ensure that the yellow 2x4 plate below the boom is locked down securely. The hook does not serve much of a purpose, if anything, it is an obstruction. Overall, one of the best tow trucks ever. If you want a tow truck for a car, I suggest getting 7638, because using this monster to tow a car is not practical XD.<br><br>The next build is the garage itself. You start out with building the office, which has computers, city map, job cards, and an odd looking coffee machine inside. It is very compact and does not take up too much space. There is a fire extinguisher in front of the office. <br><br>The next thing you build is the large open maintenance bay. At the very back, there is a drill press and lathe with compartments at the bottom. Various tools are included also. To the left is a tire rack holding four tires. Situated immediately to the right of the tire rack is the car lift. A red lever allows you to move the lift up and down, however, it is not necessary at all. The blue pick up is specially designed to fit perfectly onto the lift. To the right is where the red cab is parked, marked by two yellow lines. There is a crane above the maintenance bay and it can move forward, backward, or side to side any direction. The chain can be raised or lowered to carry the gas tanks. Unfortunately, the crane comes off too easily, it should be locked down. <br><br>Finally, you build the garage which houses the tow truck. Unfortunately, for the tow truck to fit in, the side mirrors have to be folded in. The radio tower is very flimsy and I got rid of it. There is a gas tank to the right and a recycling bin to the left.<br><br>All three sections of the garage are connected via Technic pins, making it very flimsy. Further changes can be made to correct this. <br><br>My last concern is the layout of the garage. Its design makes it very space intensive and awkward to fit nicely into your city. <br><br>Overall this is a very decent set and well worth $130 CDN for all the stuff you get. ",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-10-09T13:23:40.733Z","Lego City’s Finest…","I first saw this set in the latest Argos catalogue and immediately thought what a great backdrop it would make for all the smart new Lego City vehicles which had been released (remember I am an AFOL and place my sets on display).   I’ve also seen the set in Toys ‘R’ Us and John Lewis and resisted temptation (the £59.99 price tag was the main reason).   Anyway, I’d had a particularly tough day and needed some pleasure so I bought the last set from the local Argos.   I was amazed once again at the size of the box (Argos didn’t have a bag big enough for it to go in!) and the three building manuals and all the parts bagged into nine separate bags for sub-assemblies.   I spent a very enjoyable evening building the whole set, taking my time and enjoying the process.   It’s a big set so it does warrant a big review.

The set comprises six different parts; each one is discussed below:

The Blue Pickup:

Possibly the most basic model of the whole set; the blue pickup I presume is a garage vehicle, used for collecting spare parts and even for taking parts out to stranded vehicles when roadside repair is more feasible than bringing the vehicle into the garage.   The pickup has a small wheelbase and is presented in a grey and blue colour scheme with large grey wheel arches.   In between each wheel arch is a step or running board allowing access to the cab for the driver.   The cab is very compact with yellow seat and steering wheel.   Behind this is the flatbed area where items can be transported.   A high level brake light and front / rear bumpers and number plate finish the body off well.   The pickup is fitted with very wide tyres which protrude out from the wheel arches.   As I said earlier, the pickup is very basic, but it is there to do a job.   

The Red Tractor Unit:

The red tractor unit makes a great addition to the series of trucks which have been released by Lego.   No trailer is provided with the unit, you could always create your own, the kingpin is provided so hook-up should prove quite straightforward.   The tractor unit is provided in a bright red colour with blue and white detailing on the cab sides and rear panel.   A small cab accommodates just one minifig on a brown seat.   High mounted colour-coordinated mirrors are provided which clip onto the visor just over the windscreen.   Roof-mounted air horns as well as a roof mounted and side mounted wind deflectors add to the modern look of the vehicle.   There are also two large fuel tanks, high grill and front and rear bumpers.   A storage area for tools is provided on the outside rear of the cab.   As previously mentioned, a kingpin is provided for hooking up a trailer.   The truck driver minifig has blue trousers, a red body (with Classic Space Logo!?) And a red baseball cap.

The Heavy Duty Recovery Vehicle:

This is an absolutely huge piece of kit!   Combine this with a broken-down vehicle which is to be towed and it’s massive!   It’ll never turn on the Lego road plates, never ever!   The four-axle truck is presented in bright rescue orange with white trim and a grey chassis.   The small cab seats the one minifig and comes with its own coffee cup.   At the front of the cab is an oversized grill and bumper, all colour-keyed with headlights and blue emergency lights, a number plate is also provided.   Large high mounted colour-coordinated rear-view mirrors are provided which clip onto the visor over the windscreen.   Blue lights are provided on a bar above the cab, along with two sets of air horns.   At the rear of the cab are twin bed-mounted vertical exhausts.   The main crane arrangement is situated directly behind the cab and features a long boom with two hydraulic cylinders to facilitate a smooth lift / lowering of the main boom.   A rope mechanism from a winch flows through an eye mounted to the very end of the boom, on this is attached a hook.   There is also a heavy duty towing bracket which is provided to clip to the underside of the vehicle to be towed.   Copious amounts of lockers and storage areas are provided, as too are floodlights mounted towards the centre of the vehicle.   There are also ‘non-slip’ tread pads and blue emergency lights.   Grab handles and a large rear bumper / light board with warning chevrons graphic complete this vehicle nicely. 

The Office / Shop:

This is situated on the extreme left side of the garage and is the smallest of the three sub-assemblies which combine to make the large building.   The office is very small but well-equipped, and comes complete with numerous pieces of electronic equipment, one looks like a city map, there is also a standard desktop PC with flat screen monitor and what look to be different job cards arranged in a bright yellow holder.   The all-important filter coffee machine is located right next to the PC, but bring your own cup!   A three panel glass window and glass door finish off the office nicely.   A black flat roof is provided with an orange and white trim (the colour-scheme of the whole garage) and a roof-mounted ‘Garage’ sign.   Back on ground level is a fire extinguisher and a bright yellow safety rail (or is it an anti ram-raid device?!).

The Large Maintenance Bay:

This section makes up the centre of the set.   It features a large work area which can accommodate two vehicles at any one time.   One vehicle can park on the yellow tiles which indicate the parking area; the other vehicle can be worked on while on the ramp.   The ramp includes an arrangement where the ramp can be raised with the use of a hinge system complete with handle.   This system does feel a little unstable and could have been made more secure.   Included in this area is a storage rack for tools, a rod assembly where tyres can be stored and some pieces of equipment for use in the repair of vehicles.   One piece of equipment looks like a welding machine.   Storage cupboards are provided underneath the various pieces of machinery.   High up in the roof space is a large full-width sliding gantry system which includes a winch mechanism complete with rotating wheels and hook and chain system.   This system can lift various items on the garage floor and move them to a new location.

The Roller Door Garage:

This part of the set is located at the extreme right side of the garage.   It is a long narrow building which features a roller door at the front.   The inside of the building is very sparse providing storage room for a vehicle only.   On the outside of the garage is a pair of red and green (entry / no-entry) lights on brackets hung from the roof.   The roof of the garage includes the standard orange and white trim along with the garage / tow truck logo.   There is also a covered walkway to facilitate access from this area to the large maintenance bay.   At the far right side of the building is a girder tower with various pieces of GPS / satellite / communication aerials fixed to the top.   A bright green recycle bin is also provided.   I am a little unsure of the purpose of this building apart from somewhere to store the heavy duty recovery truck overnight.   There is not sufficient space to enable a truck to be worked on in this area, incidentally all trucks 6 blocks wide can fit into this building with their mirrors folded inwards.

All of the individual buildings can be linked together with the use of various tiles and Technic pieces to form the large layout.  Also provided with the set are four minifigs; the tractor unit driver and three mechanics.

Overall, this is a great set; it’s a big piece of kit and warrants a large space for building and for final display / play.   I was initially put off by the high price, but when you consider what is included I don’t think it is too bad.   If Lego City is your thing and are looking for a ‘base’ or backdrop for the newer City vehicles then in my opinion this set is a must.   I wonder if Lego will ever make a truck stop?   That would be most welcome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Krogh","2010-01-15T10:35:24.187Z","Good set, but has it's flaws.","I've wanted this set for some time now, and i finally got it at a great price! A great price here in Denmark being, what it normally costs in the US, hehe. All in all i got a 30% off the normal price, so that was nice.

First of all let's see what you get in the set. You get a small pickup, a tractor cab, a huge towtruck, an office, the main workshop, and a garage for the towtruck. You get 4 minifigs, 3 mechanics, and a driver for the cab. I wonder who owns the pickup? Hmm, seems like something is missing.. Oh well, the figures you DO get, are all very nice. :)

Let's look at the vehicles.
The small pickup first, it seems like no one like this little thing, but i do. It small and very simple, reminds me of the old town sets, so i think it's very nice, even though no one seems to drive it.
Then there's the tractor cab, wich i really like, it's simply awesome, all it needs is a trailer (insert imagination here.), then it would be perfect. In fact, i think it might just be the best looking cab lego has made fo far.
Finally, theres the towtruck, and this thing is huge. really great truck, although it has tool compartments, there are no tools to put in them. If you want tools in them, you have to steal some from the workshop. What looks like  big cabinets on the side, actually opens up into the inner parts of the towing mechanism. All in all, great truck.

The buildings are where the set fails a bit. The small office is nice, has a small computer, some papers, a small coffee machine, so nothing wrong here. The main workshop, also nice, has a table saw, and a table drill, and some generel tools, i think it works well. What does not work so well is the car lift. No car can drive up on it, without resting on it's belly. It is also not made to accomidate the ""normal"" cars, that has a longer wheel base. They can sit on it, but not as intended, the front or the rear will be outside the studs, meant to keep the car in place.
The crane is a nice touch, i really like it.
Finally, the garage for the towtruck, and this is not so good. The towtruck does not fit in there. Even when parked really close to the gate, it sticks out the rear of the building, also, it will not go in the gate, without flipping in the side mirrors, and when inside, theres no room for the driver to get in, or out of the truck. Not good. There are a few extra gas barrels, and a recycle bin, all of wich are nice additions. There is also a big antenna, also good.

In generel, the buildings are not very sturdy, guite flimsy actually. It all looks nice though, and the towtruck, along with the loose cab easily makes it worth getting, although i didn't think you should pay the full price, it is a bit expensive.

I give it a 4/5, because i am not completely satisfied with it.

"SgtSmash","2010-09-24T17:23:17.697Z","A bit strange...but a great set","<p>I can't help but wonder how the designers at Lego finally settled on the&nbsp;design of this set.&nbsp;My bet is that this went through several changes.&nbsp;No doubt they wanted to create a garage that would allow any size vehicle to fit in its' repair bay,&nbsp;unlike previous garage/gas station sets, and the only way to do this was to create an open design.&nbsp;In the end, you basically get three main structures on three different plates, and it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, the orange, white and black brick design&nbsp;is a great look, reminiscent of large ""fleet"" stores that do vehicle repairs.&nbsp;The&nbsp;garages' office&nbsp;is small, but has to be&nbsp;my favorite part of the set. With&nbsp;a large city map (reminiscent of the old&nbsp;1980 Exxon station), coffee maker, computers&nbsp;galore, as well as&nbsp;performance charts/paperwork, it blows away any office&nbsp;that has ever been in any previous Lego&nbsp;gas station. Also included are 4 minifigs, a small passenger truck, a semi rig, and a huge Garage Tow Truck, along with a ton of tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's clear that the designers tried to fit in as many little extras and touches of realism as they could.&nbsp;The&nbsp;tire holder is a welcome feature, albeit a bit flimsy, and the removable chain lift&nbsp;tends to serve no real purpose (except be in the way), but the play possibilities here are virtually endless. Thanks to the open bay design, you can repair even the largest of vehicles here, even the rig from the&nbsp;Agents 2.0&nbsp;Mobile Command Center. But nothing that big will fit into the large door garage, which is big enough to house the semis that come with the set. I like the tinted glass look to the garage door and communication dish tower as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I bought a large grey baseplate thinking this set would fit on it,&nbsp;but it is too wide. You could make some design changes to make it fit, but&nbsp;that would just shrink the set.&nbsp;A straight road plate is just the right width and will allow you mate the set&nbsp;up to your roads. But, there is some overhang to the structures on&nbsp;each side so it's not like this will fit right in amongst other buildings side by side&nbsp;in your town.&nbsp;Not to mention some gap&nbsp;in front of the structure&nbsp;between the office and large garage to the roads. </p>
<p><br/>The Fire Station #7945 is another similar example with an awkward footprint which forces you to improvise how to hook it up to your roads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I am no expert on what Lego's should cost people, but I suppose $99 USD is a fair price considering the number of bricks, the size of the set, minifigs, vehicles and extras included. But I am only giving this 4 out of 5 bricks for ""Value of money"" due to the footprint and lack of baseplate which I had to furnish myself. </p>

The truck garage: the garage has the new lego slidy-up door thats made up of several small interlocking parts, it has a radio antenae for incoming emergency calls, and a recycle bin and red and green lights on the outer wall.Overall a brilliant set, with lots to offer and loads of little features.<br>Hope this helps!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
