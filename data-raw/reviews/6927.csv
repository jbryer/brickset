As an ""old school"" LEGO builder, I was offended by the trailer part of this set.  I was very pleased with the tractor part of the set, and even the helicopter was nice.   The trailer on the other hand...

First off, the the good.  The tractor part of the rig is great.  Lots of attention to detail, note the steps up the the back of the cab.  Simple but visually effective.  The frame is very sturdy and really feels quite solid.  The hood lifts up to reveal the engine, a nice touch.  I especially like the new method of doing the front and rear bumpers, (a similar method on most all of the new 6 brick wide vehicles)  Of course, there are several stickers to deal with, including a small sticker that has a to be centered on a long (1x6) smooth brick, not exactly the easiest feat for a potentially novice builder.  

The helicopter is also well built.  I like the classic look of the rotor blades (a simple long black brick)  but it's interesting that the helicopters in the 2009 City sets don't have consistent elements throughout the series.  In this case, the blades are radically different from the blades on the 2009 Police Helicopter (7741).   But, one of the great things about this set is the fact that there are no stickers for the the helicopter.  All the other parts (trailer, motorcycle, and tractor) have some stickers.  

The motorcycle has a nice frame and it made me laugh when I saw the piece that LEGO used for the kick stands.  It's the T connector for the pneumatic rubber piping used in earlier Technic sets.  

The trailer had my irritated.  The base of the trailer is a single continuous piece from front to back.  It annoyed me a bit to see such a large single piece.  It felt like cheating.  With my home-grown engineering experience, I realize that there is far greater structural integrity by using a single piece for the trailer, but it offends my ""old school"" sensibilities.  I've kept it on the edge of my desk for a week to show it off and there are very few people who sit down to talk to me that don't end up playing with it at some point.  (most just go for the helicopter, but some really like the motorcycle).  The other thing that bugged me is that there are no struts to level the trailer when the tractor is disconnected.  There have been several approaches to this that come to mind, on the construction sets and the police surveillance sets, and they addressed that issue with varying degrees of success.  But it appears no attempt was made to address that issue with this set.  

All in all, it's a great set to play with, albeit with some modifications ;)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"AlterBrick__Vienna__Austria","2009-06-19T21:08:06.733Z","Only 3,2 (at the moment)? You must be kidding! It's 4,99!","OK – the main flaw: Noone would use a truck to deliver a helicopter – but hey: It's LEGO! Build a current transformer or an yacht or containers or whatever in need of transport using your other bricks. Depending on the height of the carried good one should put on or remove the spoiler from the roof.

The good side if you think of this set as a gift: It contains 3 vehicles. Because kids have only 2 hands (and 1 mouth to make the ""necessary noises"") you might be allowed to handle at least the motorcycle ;-)

MOC*-Fans/AFOLs* dislike the one-piece-trailer – for kids it is sturdy. And it keeps the price low. As well as the helicopter-""feet"".

For MOC*-Fans/AFOLs* (and kids) we have 
+headlights including turn signal flashers (where else?), 
+mirrors (ok seen before on 7733, but here they are ""painted""), 
+a cup for the driver ""in the cup holder"" ;-)
+and the star: An opening hood with a cylinder head and a water cooler inside.  I guess the opening hood is a new feature in the minifig scale, isn't it?
+plus lots of repair tools (maybe the water cooler needs to be ""repaired"" with a drilling machine? ;-)
By the way: With that amount of tools and lockers it should be easy to build a neat repair shop or an impressive pick-up-truck of a craftsman.

While the SNOT*-front seems already common (also the rear? ) the gasoline-tank with a fill-in-hole and the stairs seem to be all new SNOT*-constructions. 

And it has got doors, which both 4,7(at present)-points trucks from 2008 and 2007 lack (see set 7723 and 7991) - everytime doors are absent this fact is being critizised – this one finally has them – HOORAY!

The trailer: Let your imagination wander, what you load on it – that will make the difference. But no matter what you load – CAUTION: 4995 Cargo Copter will steal it with it’s power function! And if that happens, you have the orange helicopter and the motorcycle for an exciting chase!

The helicopter: A new, swift construction either with perfect proportions. The camera included opens the door to mix in any epoche from the medieval times to Star Wars: It always can be a place, where they are making a movie. Or do they take shots for a new highway action movie by the helicopter?

The motorcycle: Yep, somewhat big. But you get one, which is important, if you haven’t got one so far. That is unique besides a police motorcycle, a motocross cycle in one power miners set and a vintage/army cycle from the indiana jones series . . . so to me that seems precious.

Finally stickers: Yes, I also do not like them – I put on none of them and the set still looks great. That shows the high quality of the design!

The box seems a bit too big for it's content, but it is possible to use it as a garage for the built set eg to take it to friend without losing any parts.

After all: Anyone still giving that one a 3 or even less? Dare!
;-)
I really wonder, what the rating would be, if I would have written the first review?

I strongly recommend it both for collectors (for the truck repair coming up) and kids because of the huge playability.

"travisco_nabisco","2009-07-16T12:29:59.28Z","Incredible truck cab, good helicopter, alright trailer","I had been trying to decide if I wanted this set for the last few weeks. Yesterday I really wanted to do a build and this was the most reasonably priced/interesting set that I saw at Toy-r-Us.

The three minifigs are good, each one has a different facial expression.

This is my first motorcycle and it seems a bit chunky, but I figure it is easy enough to customize without using the large form.

The helicopter is really well proportioned, though I am not a big fan of the struts or the tail fin piece.

The cab of the truck is absolutely great. There is a ton of detail including, an opening hood, fuel tanks, doors, and it is 6 wide! I would buy this set for the truck cab alone.

The trailer is the only real let down of the set. It is made from one large piece, I think it is a train car piece. I can see using this piece to make a train car if you collect trains, otherwise it could take a bit of thinking to find a good way to use it in a MOC.

This set is a buy if you are a city collector. But beware, now that I have the helicopter transport I feel I need the Wind Turbine Transport, and the new Truck Stop.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-10-02T11:38:42.28Z","Ice Road Transporter…","Having been a fan of the first series of ‘Ice Road Truckers’ when I saw this set on Lego.com I instantly thought of the rigs tearing up and down the Winter Road to those diamond mines … so that was motivation enough to purchase it.   I ordered mine from the local Argos and had to wait two weeks for stock to arrive, but at £19.97 it was worth the wait and every penny!

Everything about this truck screams ‘long distance’ which is why I am confused as to its dedicated purpose of transporting the traffic copter?   Surely the helicopter would just fly from the base to the trouble spots and report from there?   Anyway, that aside, the set is really great, the cab of the truck is finely detailed and comes complete with the driver’s coffee mug (insulated so definitely an ice road hauler) twin exhausts, large roof wind deflector and opening bonnet with engine detail.   

The trailer is a one-piece design (love it or hate it as per previous reviews) I don’t personally mind it; it’s substantial and looks smart.   The trailer has plenty of storage boxes and brackets for holding various tools and accessories; there is also the heli-pad and marker lights.   I just wished Lego had included rear-steering on the trailer as this would have aided turning in tight spots.

I’m not much into helicopters, but I like this one, good colour scheme, looks modern and has a large opening cover which allows access to the cockpit.   The traffic cam is attached to a bracket and features a tape to record onto, no hard drives here!

The lead motorcycle is chunky and looks substantial, quite a departure from the old original motorbikes of the 80’s and 90’s.

I’m really pleased with this set and for the money is super value.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"meyerc13","2011-01-05T21:06:45.007Z","Triple the fun!","<p>The description of this set never made sense to me:&nbsp; ""Send the motorcycle ahead to scout out the situation, then drive up in the truck and launch the traffic copter into the air.""&nbsp; If you could drive a truck up to the scene you probably don't need a traffic helicopter!&nbsp; However, then I was watching a show on TV where a towing service used a trailer like this to transport a disassembled helicopter.&nbsp; Suddenly I had to have this set, and I haven't regretted buying it since.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The best thing about this set is the truck cab.&nbsp; The doors open, the hood opens to expose the engine, and the orange color scheme matches the other trucks in the towing fleet perfectly.<br></li><li>The orange color of the motorcycle is a pleasant change from the more typical black and white cycles.&nbsp; I left off the stickers so that it could be used as a civilian cycle, because I couldn't see it being a part of the towing company fleet.<br></li><li>As for the helicopter, it is reminiscent of a Bell 47, the iconic chopper featured on the long running M.A.S.H. TV Show.&nbsp; Once again, I couldn't see my towing company running a helicopter, but the orange colors are also associated with the LEGO Coast Guard so this joined their fleet.<br></li><li>The trailer definitely looks like a lowboy style trailer.&nbsp; There is a nice cabinet on the front with some tools, seemingly intended to be removed because it was designed to be held on with only a few studs.&nbsp; There is also a nice Octan colored brick built oil or gas barrel.&nbsp; That's a nice nod to a related City theme.<br></li><li>The set also includes three minifigures, one to drive each vehicle.&nbsp; They have the same body, but different heads.&nbsp; Two come with black helmets, the other with a black ball cap.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The biggest complaint is the large one piece train base used for the trailer.&nbsp; It looks very accurate, but it is very long.&nbsp; If you use LEGO road plates, don't expect this monster to be able to navigate your City streets.&nbsp; The length of the trailer will also dwarf your LEGO City buildings.<br></li><li>My only other criticism is the description of the set, but as you can see if you consider this as three separate sets - a civilian motorcycle, Coast Guard helicopter, and towing company lowboy - you can easily get past that bit of silliness.<br></li></ul>
<p>Don't be turned off by the nonsensical description.&nbsp; If you consider this as three separate sets in one it will make a lot more sense and you'll probably end up getting a great deal more play value out of the set.&nbsp; Even though the trailer is a bit long, it looks great and can be used to haul far more than just the included helicopter.&nbsp; This set is discontinued now, but worth picking up if you can find it at a reasonable price.&nbsp; </p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Krogh","2010-01-07T11:20:45.683Z","My first lego ""big rig""!","Let me start of by saying, that i am a truck driver by livelyhood, and on top of that, i myself transport ""special"" cargo, generelly oversized things, and so i have a unique insight into the design details on these models.

So, on to the review, first of all, there are a few flaws, most of them is only things that would help make the unit more realistic, so i wont mention them here. You can contact me if you want the full list. Two things i WILL mention, is that the compartments on the trailer, are only attached by 2 studs, and seeing as how i find myself gripping them every time i have to handle the trailer, i am pulling them of all the time. Easily fixed though. And then there is the helicopter, the blades really need some kind of locking mechanism, to keep them from spinning during transportation.

Other than that, i am overall really really really impressed with the detailes, and the functionallity, and playability of this set.

The long nosed cab is the first of it's kind, in the new truck line. At least that i am aware of, and they pulled it off expertly. When built it is extremely sturdy, and it has so many excellent detailes!
It has steps leading to the cabin, and the back of the cabin, it has rounded fuel tanks, it has opening doors, and opening front hood, there's even a small engine under the hood (fake of course, but looks nice), it has excellent exhaust pipes, but perhaps the best detail of all, is the little red coffee mug on the dashboard. I asure you, almost no trucker would leave home without it, hehe. Over all, simply a brilliant cab! Hope there will be more of these. On a side note, i was actually given a wrong piece in the bag. I got a blue piece, where i should have gotten a white. Luckely it was not a special piece, so i could replace it with what i had laying around.

Now, the Trailer. Nothing spectacullar really, just a trailer. Easy to build, sturdy enough, with the exception of the cabinets, as i mentioned earlier. A good thing is, that the rear wheels is mounted in such a way, that it gives the illusion of suspension, when the trailer is hooked up to the cab.

The motorbike, allso nothing special. It's good to have a scout vehicle when transporting oversized cargo, so it's nice enough. Would have preferred a car, though. There aren't really that many sets that containg motorbikes, so it's okay i guess.

Finally, the helicopter. I think that this really shines in it's design, it looks great, it's fun to build, and it has a couple of nice details, such as the compartments, the camera and lights, and i especially like the tail design.

The set comes with 3 minifigs, all very nice, and there's an assortment of tools, also very nice.

All in all, i am very impressed with this set, and i will most likely start collecting the new truck line. :)

5/5.
