It is very fun to play with and LEGO gave me a free gift set for buying!
Now to the pros & cons.

pros:
- fold-out play scene 
- lots of minifigures and accessories
- individual slots for 24 days
- individual bags

cons:
- does not include instructions
  
Over all I would recommend the LEGO City Advent Calendar to a friend!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"chantastic","2009-09-20T22:02:45.607Z","much better than the 2007 and 2008 City Advent Calendars","The 2009 City Advent Calendar is a big improvement over the 2007 and 2008 versions (I don't have any of the calendars before 2007, so I can't compare it to any of those). I'll go over the reasons why:

* It finally includes a Santa Claus minifig. The 2007 and 2008 ones did not.

* It finally includes a decent snow man. The snow man in the 2008 set was  kind of pathetic and 2007 didn't have one.

* It finally includes a devent Christmas tree. The 2008 one didn't have one and the one in 2007 was pathetic.

* With the 2009 set, Lego actually made an effort to make many more of the mini-sets winter-themed - there's an ice-skater, a person throwing snowballs, a little kid playing with remote controlled cars, a sled, etc. The 2007 and 2008 sets had very few winter-themed mini-sets - they were mostly just a bunch of random city scenes that had nothing to do with winter, xmas, the holidays, etc.(the 2008 set even had a girl wearing a tank top eating ice-cream!)

I actually think a lot of the mini sets in the 2009 City Advent Calendar would make a great compliment to the up-coming 10199 Winter Toy Shop. You can have the guy throwing snowballs in this set throwing snowballs at the kid in 10199. You can add the remote control cars to the toy shop. You can have Santa inside the toy shop. The ice-skater could be racing the skier in 10199.

I posted pictures of all of the mini sets on my flickr page

"jkool","2009-11-25T04:23:29.89Z","An excellent set of mini-models for your winter City theme!","This is my first Lego Advent Calendar and I was very pleasantly surprised with the set.  Each one of the mini models seem to have had a lot of thought put into them, and when completed they all compliment each other nicely.

The highlights of this model are Santa and the chimney with stockings, the Christmas tree with a present, the light pole, park bench, and drink stands.  The back of the front box flap is a printed landscape that you can use as a base to set all the models on for display. 

I was not disappointed in a single aspect of this set.  If I could improve on one thing, it would be to include less minifigures and more small models, since we already have city minifig sets that provide enough minifigs for our models.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Finally the 24th of December, I have opened all the boxes in my Lego City Advent Calendar 2009 on the appropriate days. This truely is a great set to go together with the Wintertoy shop and the Holiday train set, I have them all under my chritmas tree, and it is a nice holiday scenery under there..

"holeymoley85","2009-12-17T06:31:07.967Z","excellent","I can't believe so many people have opened the little boxes before there proper days, thats just bad luck! Am the only one who opened them on the right days?...

Anyway, this is my first lego advent calender, and i'm impressed with it, the fold out snow scene is a flimsy, but nice touch. i really like the design of the bench, traffic lights and especially the lampost which has a nice 1950's look to it.

This will be a great set for any lego loving kid(thats who its aimed at the end of the day) the minifigures are a bit new looking for me(except father christmas,always wanted one of him!) as i like lego from the 1980's-early 1990's.

excellent value for money(depending very much on where you bought it!) but Â£20 seems to be the going rate and thats about right.

An excellent build up to a lego fuelled christmas!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"smarty","2009-12-24T19:08:28.607Z","This Calendar Rules!!","This is the first City Advent Calendar I have ever seen so I bought it on ebay.  

My daughter who is four absolutely loved putting together all the minifigs, especially Santa!  I thought the remote control cars were very cool in their simplicity, why didn't I ever think of that?  The Snowman and Christmas Tree are a nice touch.

Day 1:  You get the dark blue minifig with white arms and skate helmet and three snowball!
Day 2:  The Snowman with red scarf, top hat and broomstick probably built by the minifig from day 1!
Day 3:  Snow Sled for day 1 minifig funtastic!!
Day 4:  Ice Skating Minifig with helmet, green pants, white shirt, red scarf and 
Ice Skates!                  
Day 5:  Blue and white Ice Skate Stand with Ice Skates!
Day 6:  Street Lamp with mistletoe and snowflakes, very cool lamp fitting!
Day 7:  Policeman with megaphone, black cap and outfit, red moustache!
Day 8:  Very Cool Roadblock sign with blue lights and hazard sign!
Day 9:  Traffic Light with simple and cool pedestrian crossing button!
Day 10: Postman with red upturned cap and Awesome Shoulder Bag!
Day 11: Postman's Wild ATV!
Day 12: Large brown Postage Crate and Green and White present with card!
Day 13: Tuxedo wearing Chef with appropriate hat and red mug!
Day 14: Chef's Refreshment stand with flowers and red mug!
Day 15: Brown Park Bench with snow ground piece!
Day 16: Street Sweeper Minifig in orange suit, blue upturned cap and broom!
Day 17: Street Sweeper's yellow cart with Shovel and snowball!
Day 18: Awesome Frozen Fountain with rare blue flame piece!
Day 19: Orange haired boy with short pants and red shirt, Very Cool Remote 
Control Police Car with Remote WOW!
Day 20: Checkered Flag, witches hats and Red Remote Control Car WOW!
Day 21: Lumberjack with Cool Orange High Visibility Vest and Axe, Red Hardhat!
Day 22: Lumberjack's Chainsaw and two saw horses with log to saw!
Day 23: Christmas tree! The Lumberjack must have cut this beauty down TIMBER!
Day 24: The man himself! SANTA! very cool white beard, complete with chimney with red and blue stockings!

I would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys playing Lego with their children.  This set has it all, it seems every minifig has something to do!  Great role playing all around!

The only thing wrong with this set is there are no Female minifigs?  My daughter loves This set, but she asked me once we had built it, ""daddy why isn't there any girl minifigs?""  and she is right.  Next year hopefully they can add a few female minifigs into this otherwise nearly perfect set! Merry Christmas!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"romdam","2009-12-28T04:53:35.42Z","PERFECT Advent Calendar","Picked this up from lego shop back in November once I had read that this was all winter themed.  I did actually hold off and opened only on the day I was supposed to.  Glad I did because even at 38 years old, this was awesome!  Such a simple set but yet so much fun.  The fold down flap made for a nice display.

I hope this a sign of things to come at Christmas.  I will love to have one of these every year!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EdwinJackson","2010-01-18T15:24:47.81Z","Alot better than the 2008 set. ","Skip the intro, to the Pro and Cons: 

Pros: 
- Lid is an paper ground. Nice. Hope Lego does that next year. (Lego: here is a tip, make them match together)
- Fewer non winter stuff than last year (BBQ and ice-cream stand?)
- Alot of cool stuff like; 
Santa with fire place and tree, Skaters, hot coco stand, mail-man (with car and package), road block, guy with chainsaw etc

Cons: 
- Fountain in the winter? 
- The weels on RC cars, they arent touching the ground. (add a 1x2 plate over them, and the second antena as a ...antena)
- Snowman is stupid. The one from 2008 is better. 
  - Odd colors and pieces, (black plate IN the waist? gray tile plate under the head? if they only where WHITE), 
  - Nec-scarf does not sit well under the head (i gave it to the builder at #1, made him look like Fred from Scooby Doo - btw, a Lego Scooby Doo theme would be awesome)
  - Blocky chest. Did the builder use the chainsaw for it? 
  - NO HANDS, just the broom right through the body? ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
