"baylego","2009-07-05T11:59:20.013Z","Best Bionicle $20.00 Set Ever!","This is a very nicely done vehicle. As stated in the title, this is the best bio set with this price tag ever.

  Agori
The agori isnt anything special, but the red parts are hard to come by. The helmet is also very cool, and can be turned around and still be use perfectly fine as a mask.

 Vehicle
This is the star of the set. when rolled around, the clank of the treads sounds just like a motorcycle. The only thing i dont like about the treads is that they dont roll on hard surfaces, only on carpet or blankets. The yellow and red color scheme goes nicely together. The level of detail is enough to make it cool, but not overpowering. The vehicle itself can make many nice poses, as the black swords move up and down, and the handlebar section goes side to side.

   Overall, this set is a must have for any bionicle fan, and deserves a 6/5!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"james3426","2009-10-17T16:54:13.763Z","""Out of the way, or I'll run you down!""","This was my first 2009 vehicle and it is nothing like Vutraz and the Skyfighter as some of you say! The build of Crotesius is like Vultraz though. The Cendox has three main sections: The back treads with the jet boosters on top; the front part with the steering wheel, jet packs, and Thornax Launcher; And the front blades, with the liftarm that connects them to the front. Crotesius can easily fit on by holding the steering wheel and below, there is an axle 3 with stud that you can connect the BOHROK FEET to. Bohrok feet have not been in a regular (not a promo) Bionicle set since 2006, and they are great for MOCing. Back to the vehicle. The Thornax Launcher flops downward, but this can easily be fixed if you add a long pin two studs under it. My favorite part of it is how the steering wheel actually turns most of the front section.

Pros:
Awesome turning function.
Cool helmet.
Recolored Kiina Armor piece.
Nice design.
BOHROK FEET!
Recolored Climbing Claw. (rare)

Cons:
None

In all, a great set to all Bionicle fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bajadogq","2009-12-20T20:27:42.03Z","A BRILLIANT Bionicle vehicle!","This set is CRAZY AWESOME! Crotesius has cool coloring and an amazing duel-sided helmet. However his build lacks complexity. Also the life-counter is kind of stupid. The Cendox on the other hand, has this awesome industrial feel to it. The silver parts are evenly distributed among this yellow wonder. Speaking of the silver parts, I like how the engine is placed at the center of the Cendox. The steering feature is another awesome part of this set. However, there are some minor bad parts of this set. The treads don't work on flat surfaces, the Thornax launcher won't stay upright, and all those red and blue pins are SO annoying! Anyways, on with the pros and cons.

Pros:
-Color Scheme
-Steering
-Crotesius
-Silver Parts
-Loads of Playability

Cons:
-Treads Don't work on Flat Surfaces
-Life counter
-Crotesius' Simple Build
-Red and Blue Pins
-Floppy Thornax Launcher
