lets move on to pros and cons

Pros:
great playability
nice build
bionicle game
helmets are dual sided
great color scheme
agori's hands
thornax launcher
my first wheels!!
great MOCability

cons:
wheels are not aligned perfecly to center(i'm very picky about that)
lots of gaps



well there you have it! 
be sure to pick this one up!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Iro","2009-08-02T21:04:42.81Z","A Decent Set With Its Pros and Cons","All right, so I got this set in the mail a few weeks ago, and I was really psyched for it. Now that I own it and have played with it, here are my thoughts:

Kirbraz:
His build is really simple, as is standard for most impulse sets, so that was no surprise. I love his color scheme (blue and black), it looks really good. The flip helmet has its flaws, but they're ignorable.

Scodonius:
Kirbraz's twin. He's basically the same, except for the fact that his limbs are medium blue. The blue fists strike me as odd (though it's no surprise, considering none of the sets that need black fists [Fero, Sahmad, and Scodonius] don't), but they're no big deal.

Kaxium V3 (Main Cycle):
The assembly is straightforward, and takes about 20-30 minutes to build. The build may seem to be much too asymmetrical for your liking, but fear not; once completed, the cycle looks fine, and the asymmetrical design does not make it look any better or worse. Despite what the previous reviewer said, the wheels do attach perfectly in the center of the rods (the tires are just a little hassle to get on the wheel), so don't worry about that too much. It is aesthetically pleasing until you notice the rather large gaps on the bottom. Here's how to fix that:
A) Push the handlebars down, so the Mistika shield covers up the gap...
or B) Immediately place Kirbraz in the cycle and never take him out

Kaxium V3 (Sidecar):
This is a really simple build. Slap a couple of TECHNIC liftarms together, add a couple of extra parts, and you're done. It's flat and gappy (though they're not as giant as the Main Cycle's), but that has the same fix as the Main Cycle. The Thornax Launcher is mounted on another Mistika shield by four TECHNIC pieces, so it's kind of loose until you mount Scodonius on the car.

Kaxium V3:
As a whole, it's very aesthetically pleasing. Blue, black, and silver look nice together, though the pilots blend in (sort of). I love the split apart feature, it really adds to the enjoyment of the set. Since Kirbraz and Scodonius are always in place, I've forgotten about the gaps, and I'm sure if you ignore the bad and focus on the good, you will, too.

Pros:
Good bang for your buck
Flip helmets for you MOCists
Decent selection of parts
Aesthetically pleasing to the eye
Very fun to play with

Cons:
Both vehicles are quite gappy without the pilots
Pilots are perhaps a bit too similar (though you can flip one of their helmets around)
Flip helmets have their flaws (this is more predominant in the Baranus V7 and Skopio XV-1 sets)
Neither the Main Cycle or the Sidecar can turn

Overall Rating:
8/10

Brickset Rating:
4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pleasantly Surprised!","I'm no fan of the Bionicles series. &nbsp;I got the kit for about half off the $30 price tag, thought I'd pick it up for the Technics-style bars and pins; this kit, I've discovered, has a TON of them! &nbsp;When I opened up the kit I decided to do it justice and put it together as designed for S&amp;G. &nbsp;I was very pleasantly surprised by the build experience with the structure being held together with very clever use of the pins that rest at the half-way-in point only to be pushed in the rest of the way when a supporting structure is added to the model.<div>(p)</div><div>That being said, I don't think I'll be buying into the whole Bionicle lego sets for the story or game, but I may just pick up another of these kits (on clearance) for the HUGE rear wheel and cool little wheels and the above mentioned Technic-style parts/pieces.</div><div>(p)</div><div><ul><li>Pros:</li><li>Lots of really cool parts for other lego projects</li><li>Intended design is a really cool build with just the right level of difficulty</li><li>Finished kit looks awesome</li><li>The Bionicle action figures are fun to mess with (doubling up the legs, etc.)</li></ul><div>(p)</div><div><ul><li>Cons:</li><li>Asymmetrical construction in parts of the bikes, excusable for the parts that connect the two bikes together (one side sticks out on one bike to connect to the part that sticks out on the other bike) but not excusable for the handlebar setup on one bike that has poor support in places.</li></ul></div></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"KodakKid365","2010-11-17T18:08:19.83Z","The Kaxium is a cool vehicle. ","It comes with to guys which both ride in the car which is good. It has the gun attched and a lot of armor which is also good. One of the best parts is that, yes, you can separate the bike into two smaller ones. The color scheme isn't my favorite but it's good.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
