Were the Glatorian Legends going to be there, finally? No. Not one. My heart sank. But wait, I thought, whats that man taking out of that cardboard box? Could it be the Baranus V7? And boy was I excited, first one on the shelf! I quickly picked up the box and ran to pay faster than you could say Mata Nui! Anyway, lets get on to the review:

Sahmad
Sahmad is brilliant. For once we dont have a really skinny agori who looks annorexic. This guys got some beef! The Mantax pincers act well as armour and the recoloured Kalmah tentacle makes a great whip. ""Faster you spikit! Faster I say!""

Baranus V7
The Baranus V7 is a great chariot and is really fun to be pulled around with by the spikit. It includes alot of spikes; which make it look fearsome and brutal. Although a great part of the set (the main part of the set!), I would have liked it to be a tad bigger but its still good.

Spikit
The spikit is my favourite part of the set; wasn't challenging to build but wasn't too easy. It hasn't got a lot of posability but you can make a mean running pose or even have it standing on hind legs, a feature which I really like. You can even put Sahmad (or any other agori) on it's back! Anyway, lets see the pros and cons:

Pros:
Good size
3 in 1
Fun playability
Nice agori

Cons:
263 pieces for Â£30 ($50)

Overall: Great set. I would highly recommend!

"Alex13542","2009-10-26T20:01:29.59Z","Awsome Vehicle","While not the Skopio XV-1, this $40 set is worth it every time! With a cool new mask, also on Tellerus, and a unique body design this is an interesting creature. The rider, I forget his name, has a cool sword/thornax launcher and an awsome chariot. The back wheels are a little too close for my liking but surprising it still rolls! As a mater of fact if you take off the Spikit (creature), it goes very far! Anyway now onto the pros and cons.

pros: 
         Wheels spin
         Awsome helmets
         head(s) move/moves
         movibility/posability
         Chariot design
cons:
         chain tangles
         when standing not as tall as picture and box say(the size of Gresh)
         Tenacle is too big
         Wheels are too close

  As always GET,BUY,GET

"Casey1280","2010-04-06T13:01:52.5Z","Its 3-in-1!","Well, here we have the Baranus V7: A great vehicle set that includes a nice Agori, a well-built chariot, and an awesome Spikit.<br>Now, lets look at the all the separate things we have in this box:<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sahmad (Agori)</span> <br>Unlike the rather generic Agori we got in early 2009, this one is actually quite interesting. The black Mantax claws are great armor, the whip is cool, and the thornax launcher/sword is great. The only bad thing about Sahmad is that his armor restricts poseability a little, but if you remove the armor it'll be fine and wont detract from Sahmad's appearance.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Chariot</span><br>The chariot is indeed a great part of the set - the parts are useful and the wheels have some potential for armor. The color scheme looks great - A mix of silver, grey, gunmetal and some black. Its also great for playing with - The wheels roll perfectly along any surface and the blades connected to the front wheels can ram into things. Another great feature is that nearly any canister/matoran/agori can connect to it.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Spikit</span><br>This is the best part of the set - interesting build, unique colors and its a two-headed dragon thing. The color scheme works surprisingly well: The mix of black, dark green, lime green and gunmetal look fine. As for pieces, there are a few useful parts here - The gunmetal Hordika feet especially. And it can stand up on two legs! Win!<br><br>As for anyone wondering, if you live in the UK like me, the price is very sensible: 29 pounds and 99 pence. <br><br>Pros:<br>-Spikit=Win<br>-Great Agori<br>-Great chariot<br>-Cool color scheme<br>-Sensible price<br><br>Cons:<br>-Nothing!<br><br>Overall, this is a great set and I recommend buying it if you can't afford the Thornatus or Skopio.<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5

I got this set used as part of an EBay&nbsp;lot. It&#39;s also a great first bionicle set and I love it. Mine didn&#39;t &nbsp;come with the box or instructions;&nbsp;I built it off Brickset.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Spikit is my favorite part of this fantastic set.&nbsp;I love Bionicle and love this 3-in-1 Bionicle set.&nbsp;</p>
