It can unfold it's ""Wings"", move it's Thornax Launcher: forward; turn 360 degrees; and move it downward, and includes four Midak Skyblasters (Force Blasters in this case) worth of zamor spheres (Force Spheres). Also includes two SILVER KANOHI CRAST! 

The pilot, Perditus, looks like Antroz from the Jetrax T6 somewhat, but much cooler because, the upper arms have two pinholes and an axlehole on the SIDES! His helmet looks well-designed and also comes in orange in the Baranus, so you can add it on to an orange or dark red MOC. 

                                            Pros:
                        Thornax Launcher is very poseable.
     Many weapons, including Krika legs, Tri-Talons,and Multi-Resistant shield.
                             Awesome folding out action
                                      Many Zamors
                       Four Midak Skyblasters (Force Blasters)
                          Perditus has cool new pieces
                              SILVER KANOHI CRAST

                                          Cons:
                               Is this really necessary?

In all, an Awesome Vehicle. I highly recommend this to anyone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"dso1997_9","2012-07-17T11:54:55.893Z","Thornatus V9","Perditus is a vehicle Glatorian for the Fire Tribe who uses a Thornatus V9 in his matches<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>The vehicle itself has an expert design and the instructions are perfect. I had an easy time building this and it took me a little over 45 minuntes. Generally, I find the Technic-like sets to be a bit of a departure from Bionicle, but the Thornatus went against my preconceptions. The device moves smoothly and looks amazing. This set surpassed my expectations of the 2009 vehicle line and definitely makes me feel better about the Glatorian line.</li></ul><ul><li>Bionicle avoided the use of wheels up until 2006 with the Inika/Piraka playsets which were essentially regular LEGOs. The line of Glatorian vehicles features four out of five sets with the previously rare wheels. The huge wheel in the back is both purposeful and appealing, it provides a stunning piece that differentiates this set from others. The four wheels in the front fold out very well and seem to highlight the rocky, desert feel of the 2009 sets.</li></ul><ul><li>Perditus himself is an average Inika build with Toa Metru feet and a burgundy Baranus helmet. He does, however, fit with the Thornatus and supplies the role of a worthy pilot figure for this large machine. I find Perditus to be just weak enough so that his use in the vehicle is not wasteful, but powerful enough that it does not make him look to pathetic. On a separate note, the character Perditus is also very interesting.</li></ul><ul><li>I myself find Thornax launchers a waste, so I was pleased to see that they were outnumbered 4 to 1 in this set. I think the Midak Skyblaster is the best projectile weapon Bionicle has conceived and I am glad to see so many of them in one product.</li></ul>Cons:<br><br><ul><li>The Thornax launcher is a useless attempt at uniformity. They are not at all aerodynamic (and no, I do not accept the Hero Factory alternative of using a recolored Zamor Sphere in the place of a Thornax) and they supply no real benefit to the set aside from reminding us that the Thornatus V9 is just another Glatorian set. It is useless compared to the myriad other weapons on this and I will be happy to see the Thornax go away.</li></ul><br>This is a very good set and though it may be pricy, I find it to be worth it.<br><br>By Vakama<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"KodakKid365","2011-01-03T12:14:08.487Z","Darned awesome!","It's really awesome but not worth the price. It has like for different guns, and a huge wheel in the back. The front has four smaller ones. It's really awesome. But It's only worth about fifty, so try not to get it at full price.",FALSE,4,4,4,5,3
