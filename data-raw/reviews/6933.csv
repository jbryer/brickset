"mr_brightside711","2009-07-15T10:01:56.717Z","Like, WHOA!","I got this set from lego shop online and this was a big suprise for me. I order it with 7 other lego sets and they all came in 4 boxes. but this set got its own huge box. this IS the biggest baddest bionicle set evre in my opinion.

The build was a little of a challenge. It took me about 2-3 hours to finish it. It was very fun to build except for the 4 legs. You build 1 and have to repeat it 3 more times and by the last leg, I really didnt use the instructions.

The treads are also great and heavy duty. Only they dont roll on slick or hard surfaces. But one of they coolest parts about this is the size. I dont know where Im going to put this beast. One more thing is the pinchers on the front are a little bit too manual. I was thinking there would be a knob or something.

Pros:
Great size for price
The biggest Bionicle set!
Glatorian figure
Heavy duty treads
Treads roll and make cool sounds
Very strurdy
Huge
Thornax
Thornax Launcher
2 blasters
2 life counters
New peices
Still Huge
Ton of peices
Transforms into crawler/tank
Scorpion features

Best Feature:
This HUGE vehicle can transform into a tank or a scorpion walker!

Cons:
Glatorian's fore-arms are yellow, not orange-yellow
Glatorians legs get in the way of the front tracks when it is in tank mode
Build is a little repetitive

This is one of THE BEST bionicle sets I have EVER BOUGHT. It is huge and mean and its a transforming machine! THIS IS AWESOME. I KNOW ANY FAN WOULD ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT! Please get it. Cause you wont regret it!

"Starstreak","2009-08-10T01:55:56.14Z","I think its 2009 best Bionicle sets","I did a full review with photos here:
http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=31749&hl=


Here is my closing from that review:

Features
Not a bad set. The tracks move. Each tracked part can swivel outward and fold out to give it legs like of an insect. Comes with TWO ball shooters and one of those spiked ball shooter. The figure is totally pose able. The middle armor can move up/down, and so can the ""tail"" move up/down.


My rating:
Playability: 3/5. Most Bionicle sets are meant to be played by kids. Only thing with this set is it's built closer to that of a Technic set. Because of this, the vehicle feels fragile when articulating the legs.
Design: 5/5. When comparing to other Bionicle sets, this ranks up there in design. Someone put a lot of thought in thinking how the vehicle can transform from a ""walking"" vehicle to a ""tracked"" vehicle. Given more time and parts, I think it could've been made a bit more realistic with a engine or something.
Build experience: 3/5. Comparing it to other Bionicle sets, this is... Hmm. Not sure. I don't normally built Bionicle. My son does. But since I build the ""bigger"" Bionicle sets, this would be one of the more complicated sets but a lot of it was ""wash, lather, rinse, and repeat.""
Overall: 4/5. This set was over $85. It was worth it. I liked the design. My local Toys R Us has it for $105! Nope. Not worth that price.

This set is pleasing in every thing but size and that was pretty disapionting :( . Tellerus is great but the blue axel/pin peices are anoying. His feet don't fit well either. The Midak Sky Blasters are great but don't make up for it's cons.

pros: 
           treads
           Tellerus
           weapons
           Antraz's claws

cons:

           Thornax falls out
           Telleruses foot space
           blue axel/pin converters on Telleruses feet 
           takes too much time to transform and build

"AT_TE_is_so_cool","2014-10-02T23:37:55.4Z","Best Bionicle Set Ever!","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before I begin the review, I want to share my background&nbsp;knowledge on this set. The yellow character riding the Skopio&nbsp;X-V 1 is called Telluris. Telluris is the only iron tribe Bionicle character to be made in a set other than Sahmad in the Baranus V-7. Telluris is one of the few surviving members of the iron tribe which were wiped out around 103,000 years before Mata Nui arrived on Spherus Magna by a phenomenon known as the Dreaming Plague. Telluris led himself and other surviving members of his tribe into a cave in fear of being infected by others of the tribe. He gave the idea of using minerals from the cave to color their armor and helmets and allow them to disguise themselves and integrate into the other tribes. The plan failed, and the tribe scattered.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Telluris eventually found acceptance among other agori who shared his love of machinery such as Berix of the water tribe. The water tribe learned many things from him, and eventually paranoia and jealousy took hold, and Telluris cast out from the other agori in fear they were out to get him and his ideas. In order to eliminate the threat, he designed the Skopio&nbsp;X-V 1 which was modeled off the Skopio&nbsp;which was a creature the tribe honored. He then roamed the barren desert, occasionally telling the Skrall of what he had seen. In the movie The Legend Reborn, he and his vehicle are crushed by an avalanche. He escaped, but his vehicle was deystoyed. Eventually Sahmad found him, he offered to take him north to get new parts to his vehicle. I could probably talk about this all day, but you can read more at BIONICLEsector01, and now for the set review!</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions/Contents/Parts</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The box is decent in size for a set this large, and contains a beautiful image of the set on the front and play features on the back. There are two &nbsp;50&nbsp;pg long instruction manuals, and bags labeled 1-4, although there are four number two bags, which each one used for a leg of the vehicle. there is a fine assortment of parts, many being exclusive to this set as in all Bionicles. Strangely enough, If you look at Telluris&#39; mask from the back, you notice it is the same mould&nbsp;as the heads of the Baranus monster in Baranis V-7.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The build is quite nice with a massive use of technic as in all large Bionicle sets. Some of you who enjoy technic will love this part, but those of you who don&#39;t won&#39;t be too happy. Although a lot of interesting techniques are used, such as a rubber band to add a nice touch below the fangs, there is some repetition with the legs/treads.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The completed model looks very nice with the bright red pieces and a large stinger cannon in the back. Telluris comes off easily and is very pose able and full of action.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Building Experience</em>: 3. Lots of repetition, and not all of us likes technic, right?</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Parts</em>: 5. As in all Bionicle sets, there are some must-get exclusive pieces that everyone loves.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Playability</em>: 5. Lots of fun playable features. You can turn the legs and unfold them to go from scorpion mode to driving mode. You can snap the front teeth, and open up the red flaps in the back to raise the cannons with a thornrax launcher and two large cannons that hold four pieces of ammo at a time. If you collect more Glatorian 2009 sets, you can do the thornrax launcher game with the inclusion of health meters.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Value for money</em>: 4. Definitely worth it, but as with all Bionicle sets the price is higher than 10 cents per piece.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Overall</em>: 5. An absolute must get for Bionicle&nbsp;lovers of all ages with tons of playability, unique parts, and one of the few sets of the iron tribe. This set contains a nice 849 pieces, with the only Bionicle set bigger being 2005&#39;s Battle of Metru Nui with 858 pieces. I really hope you buy this set and enjoy it as much as I do.</p>

"Nmfrey23","2022-06-04T02:46:27.043Z","It's big! It's red! It's Skopio XV-1!","<p>I&#39;m willingly going to forget about the Battle of Metru Nui set. This is the largest Bionicle set. The battle vehicles from Bionicle are some of my favourite Technic builds because of how creative they are. I mean, this is a literal tank with the ability to walk upright. Nearly all the battle vehicles are great, but this is one of the best.</p>

<p>Telluris:</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Despite odd proportions, this is a full-sized figure.</p>

<p>New mask looks great.</p>

<p>Has a couple uncommon parts like Toa Mata feet in yellow-orange and Slizer arms in yellow.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some won&#39;t like the strange way the figure&#39;s elbows look and move.</p>

<p>While these can be removed easily, some may not like that the tubes stay attached to his head.</p>

<p>Brittle joints (applies to all 08&#39;-10&#39; sets).</p>

<p>Skopio XV-1</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Complexity: This set has 849 parts, so you&#39;ll be kept busy for a while when building it.</p>

<p>Convertible: The legs of the Skopio can be folded together and bent, letting the massive vehicle roll around on its treads</p>

<p>Leg movement: Each of the Skopio&#39;s 4 legs can bend at the knee, fold inward and outward, and even be raised in the air.</p>

<p>Launchers: This set has three different launchers mounted on a tail-like appendage that can be raised and lowered. There are two Midak Skyblasters on either side of the tail (each holds 4 shots) and there is a Thornax launcher in the centre (holds 1 shot and is backwards-compatible with 06&#39; and 08&#39; ammo).</p>

<p>Other functions: This set has a couple other functions that aren&#39;t in the spotlight as much. The Skopio&#39;s pincers can clamp shut or remain open thanks to a rubber band, there are technic plates that can close around the tail to give the set more of an armoured look, and there are two battle wheels mounted on the tail.</p>

<p>Overall look: This vehicle looks beastly upon completion.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Some people may not enjoy the building process. All four legs are identical (as a heads-up, the instructions won&#39;t say to make 4x of them until you finish the first leg, so there will be some backtracking through instructions).</p>

<p>When standing, the vehicle won&#39;t fall, but it will wobble a lot.</p>

<p>Ball joints in the legs can stiffen if dusty.</p>

<p>The tail can fall on its own&nbsp;due to the weight of the blasters attached.</p>

<p>Brittle joints (applies to all 08&#39;-10&#39; sets).</p>

<p>Price tag.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bionicle sets don&#39;t get much bigger and badder than this. Skopio XV-1 is an amazing set that has few downsides other than its price tag. If you enjoyed any of the other battle vehicles, this set will certainly be worth your time to look for. 5/5.</p>
