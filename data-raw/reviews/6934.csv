"gratefulnat","2009-05-24T06:01:35.39Z","Nothing spectacular, but jetpack figures.","The build is straightforward, nothing exciting, but I certainly do like the combinations of grey - the color scheme is much better than the previous tank from Ep III, set 7258, and structurally this new tank is certainly stronger, although there is no seat for a driver droid. The only fun I had with the build was the 'eyes', very neat the way they are connected. The printed round plates are also a plus. There is a 2x10 plate with some inverted slopes that can be used to 'catapult' the figures, hmmm, about on par with some of the poorer functioning flickfire systems - basically blah. I would have preferred a driver droid than the 7 pieces needed for this catapult.

The droids are droids, nothing needs be said. The two jetpack clones certainly save this set in my opinion. The jetpacks are as such recognizable, but could have used a little coloring - the white of the jetpacks does not stand out well against the white clones.

Overall, a fun playset for the kids, jetpack figures for us oldies, so I rate this a 3 out of 5.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"skipp","2009-06-08T15:37:10.89Z","Corporate Alliance Tank Droid AKA Snail Droid","Well, I bought this along with Echo Base the other week, for about 26 euros in a german TRU. The set comes with four minifigures, including the new jet troopers.

The jet troopers are basically normal clones, except with a brand new piece: The jetpack. It molded plastic, and the neck bracket is wider than usual. The other Figures are two Battledroids.

Onto the tank. Not much playability. The front ' feet' can lift up, so that if it needs to go up a hill or something...It can roll perfectly on carpet, but I took out one of the pins in the tread because it was sagging slighty. as always, they built in flickfire missiles on the left and right. It is slightly smaller than the older Snail Droid.

Onto the final bit, the catapult. It basically a couple of bricks slapped together, where you set your clone on, and slap your hand on the other end. The clone does a summersault and lands on his head. Ouch.

"P13c30fch33s3","2009-08-03T04:32:47.607Z","Good for Army Building","As the title says, this set is good if you want to build up an army. It does have its down sides, but I'll get to those later.

Clone Troopers:
Nothing special. Except for the jetpacks. the jetpacks areof a very good design.
I also recommend this even if you only want the jetpacks.

Good points:
Jet packs

Bad points:
Nothing else is new

Battle Droids:
Nothing too special either. The Battle Droid needs something more, but you can never have too many. Especially if you have the MTT.

Good Points:
You can never have enough

Bad Points:
A bit boring now - needs something to bring more interest

Mini Catapult...Thing (Not displayed in picture):
Basically a few bricks slapped together. Nothing spectacular at all. If you lift it into the air, it works quite well as a catapult. Problem is, in a reality situation, the Clone Troopers would fly then die because they flip and land on their heads. Not very healthy.

Tank Droid:
This is the centrepiece of the set. It is smaller than the EpIII Tank Droid But the rear axle (and wheels) is sturdier.

Good Points:
The back wheels do not roll off the axle (unlike the old one).
The front 'treads' pivot up and down (unlike the old one).
The bottom cannons are flick-fire missiles (unlike the old one).
The 'eyes' are more movie accurate (unlike the old one).
The large discs are printed (like the old one).
The tread moves smoothly and does not get stuck (unlike the old one).
It is movie/episode accurate (like the old one).

Bad Points:
It is smaller than the old one.
It looks too short (unlike the old one).

Summary:
Good IF:
You want jetpacks
you want more battle droids/clones
you want a(nother) tank droid
you like playable sets

Bad IF:
You are very picky on movie size-accurateness (It is meant to be as big as the AAT but it is a bit smaller)
You want good value for money

the box shows the tank droid rolling towards the two clones, one of them flies towards the tank and the other one doesn't seem to be interested at all because he looks the other way.

the minifigurers: notting to fancy, 2 regular battle droids, and 2 clones with new jetpacks, wich are cool

the build: also nothing really special, maybe even to simple for me.

the tank: the tank is cool, it looks like the one from the clone wars. the massive improvement are the eyes. it has 4 lasers, 2 of them are flick fire.
the tank can roll much better than it's predecesor even on flat area's. howver comparerd to the old version or the new AAT it looks really dumitive. 

price: ouch time! 27 euro's is just to much for this.

This set is actually really cool, It is way better than the old Tank Droid and has a million more cool and interesting features.

Everything on the tank has changed from the old one. The eyes, the guns even the way it moves along the ground is better. The thing I find annoying is the two platform/ ski like panels on each side of the tank spin around, I understand why they do that (When going over hills/ bumps they turn to get the tanks over in one piece) but I still find it kind of irritating, but that is no reason not to buy this set.

The new Clone Jet Troopers are really awesome, (I personally think that they should have some sort of pattern/ detail on them to tell them apart from normal Clones) their jet packs are small but really appealing. And the Droids are just the same as always.

The price of this set is surprisingly fantastic! I was expecting a solid $60.00 NZ but instead I scored a $50.00 + a 20% discount! Making this set 40 bucks, a great buy.

There is one thing that is slightly disappointing about this set which is why I gave it a 4/5. If you place this set next to the 8018 AAT, it appears to be a lot smaller. In the Clone Wars series these two tanks are about the same size, but fortunately LEGO has forgotten that.

Do not let my one con stop you buying this set, it is a really good by and great for building up huge armies.

I will start with some information about the minifigures! These are very nice, especially the jet troopers, you can really see the effort Lego must have put in to designing the new jetpacks. The battle droids are common but you can't have to many!

The Tank Droid is so accurate to the film and rolls very well, also, although I don't mind stickers, for everybody reading this who does, the detailing on the tank is printed on. The tank also has flick missiles which I quite like, and if you flick it properly it can go about two feet!

Pros:
-Price is reasonable.
-Awesome new jet packs on the clones. Hopefully we'll see a Boba/Jango Fett with a helmet separate from the jet pack.
-Pretty accurate.
-Although it is too short, this MOD here: http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=33300 (not mine) shows how to make it better looking and more accurate, using only the extra treads and the useless clone 'catapult.'
-You can never have enough battle droids.
-Very nice printing on the dishes on the sides.
-No stickers (I don't care much but most fans do).

Cons:
-Too short (this doesn't really count though since it can easily be fixed.

Minifigs:2 battle droids and 2 jet troopers nothing too special here, just the jetpacks whick are like backpacks but in um jet form..

Build Process: Takes about 30 minutes for an average builder to build. In my opinion building it was a bit boring and easy. The treads can be a bit annoying and it comes loose easily. But it can be fixed if you just remove one of the treads and stretch the rest out to make it tighter.

Final Product:Looks cool and it kinda fun. No stickers in this set. It would be a good army builder if the price went down slightly. This set also comes with a ""catapult"". It's supposed to launch the troops into the air as if they were flying, but it kinda fails and is pointless in my opinion.

I misssed the first one so I wanted to grab this one up ASAP. I was dissapointed. This set is VERY lackluster. It brings nothing new to the star wars seen and is actually quite boring. The bumbers in the front flop around and the treads always get stuck. There is no droid pilot(unlike the last one), the eyes are too small(unlike the last one), and the colors are accurate, but boring(unlike the last one). I could on and on about the negatives but hey, I got it on sale for $19.99 at Target! This is a fair price considering it has 4 figs and slightly over 200 pieces. The jettroopers are nice, but overall, kind of boring. They feature no excess detail besides the jump pack and have no unquiness to them. 

Pros:
The figures are good, but overall, nothing new.

"HQuiff","2010-02-28T14:02:31.53Z","Over Par!","This is my first Star Wars set I have gotten in years, and I'm glad I did. This set offers such a lot, and is definitely worth 25 Euro. To be honest, I got it on sale which was handy, as before hand it was a mind-boggling overpriced - 35 Euro! Scary, I know.

For a start, this set takes perseverance to get around the minor flaws, in other words, you need a bit of imagination (Cheesiness alert!!) and some observational tweaks. If you're not prepared to do that then I advise you don't get it.

Certain aspects like the treads have some problems, e.g they don't roll, on any surface. However here are some very simple things you can do that can easily fix your problems:

1. Take off one or two of the Treads and see how you get on!
2. Are you finding that the two roller wheels at the back keep coming loose? Then take the inner round piece off, and just keep the umbrella like bits on and the dark blue gray pieces on top of those.
3. One thing you should do is take a look at the clog located at the top of the vehicle, or around about. You'll need to move it down one, so it becomes loose rather then tight. I don't know if this is actually a mistake I made in the instructions, hmm...

OK, now that I've been nit-picky about certain functions lets get onto what's good about this set! For starters, it's not as colorful as the other one, which makes it not only look more realistic but it adds to it's versatility.
The design used for the eyes is pure genius as well! It can move 360 Degrees and is more then easily maneuvered (That's the wrong place to put that word, isn't it? Thought so)! The overall design is sturdy and features like the new missile work really well.


The Playability Factor is also very high, almost setting a new standard. It fits well in any Star Wars base and runs smoothly over any baseplate. 
Onto the Minifigures! First up the Droids, my favourite! As I do not have any Droids with hands facing up ways, this was a great treat. They look very new, but still have the classic look. As for the Clones - these are spectacular! The detail is really very realistic and the Jetpacks are very exclusive, and well executed.

All and all this is a top Star Wars set, which is well over par! I recommend it to anyone who likes Star Wars, Droids, Clones, and LEGO, to be honest. Probably 83.2/100, or around about.

If I had enough money right now, I'd buy a dozen more to build the frontline of my Trade Federation Army. The price isn't bad either.

A notable point about this set is that there are no stickers; the side plates are printed. Hooray!

This set comes with a launcher to simulate the Jet Clone Troopers 'flying' although I never used it. However, that should not be counted against it, it's just that I generally display my sets and don't play with them. And I have to say, the chain link tread on the Tank Droid rocks!

"Darth_Sidious2","2010-01-25T14:13:38.513Z","Pretty Good","This set retails for $24.99 USD, and includes 216 pieces. If excluding each thread piece (56 total), you have a 160 Piece set, with 4 generic figures (No, the ""Jetpacks"" doesn't improve the clones enough to make them not generic) for $25. I have nothing against the set, I actually love it, but $19.99 should be it's price. No reason to justify $5 more. This is why it gets a 4 out of 5.

Pros:
- Best attempt at a Tank Droid yet. Remember the orange one?
- ""Jetpack Clones"" (Though I'm not too impressed, I can't really see how they could have improved them!)
- Battle Droids have Blasters (Cough AAT)
- No Stickers

Cons:
- Scale isn't perfect (Droids cant stand on sides, too short/stubby)
- PRICE!

Definitely a good set, and if Lego dropped the price $5 and threw in another 10 bricks to make it more realistic in terms of scale, it would be a perfect set. A- ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legend234","2010-02-09T14:47:55.827Z","Not bad.","I bought this set for £22, it has 160 pieces (not including the treads) and this is a good attempt at a tank droid (much better than the previous). Anyway onto the review:

Minifigs: We get 4 minifigs, two jetpack clones (Regular clones but have a one piece jet pack with a collar) with blasters and two regular droids with blasters. Nothing really amazing about the minifigs and the jetpacks are good, I just thought we could have got an entirely diffrent minifig for the jetpackers.

7/10 for the minifigs

The build: The build is longer than you think because you have to fit all the treads together which is deathly boring, apart from that it is okay fairly quick build.

6/10 for the build

The tank: The tank looks very similar to the ones in the star wars universe, the only problem is that none of the droids can fit on the side like in the movie (on kashyyyk) which I found anoying because I would have used it as a people/droid carrier.

8/10 for the tank

The features: The tank has very few features and most of these dont work very well. First of all there are the long flick fire missiles which don't work you flick them and they dont even go an inch. The treads dont work on smooth services (e.g wooden floor) but they work on carpets and beds etc.

6/10 for the features

This just narowly scrapes a 4 for the jetpack troopers.

"123MrBrick","2020-12-28T20:05:34.537Z","Middling in almost every way.","<p>It&#39;s time again for my yearly review of a set no one cares about anymore.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had this set since it was released and decided a while back to rebuild it as it has a number of distinct parts that were easy to locate in my bins. It took the very tight grip of boredom brought on by current events for me to even consider making the dive.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box art is nice enough, depicting a rather tightly-packed action scene which appears to take place on Christophsis. As far as I can tell from my very cursory research, this droid never took part in the fighting on that planet. I say that only because there isn&#39;t much else to say. The instructions are efficient and clear enough, though they do continue the irritating habit of not listing what parts are involved in each step. Not so much of a problem here but on larger models it&#39;s easy to miss a small piece that appears on the build between steps without warning.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s get the obvious out of the way, roughly a quarter of this set&#39;s parts count is eaten up by the tread links that wrap around the center of the droid. Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to you. This is one of only eleven sets to include them; maybe you&#39;d like them for a MOC. But dividing the number of links into two, three, four treads isn&#39;t going to produce a very large vehicle. Most of the rest of the pieces are standard fare for anyone with a degree in LEGO Star Wars, but the two large printed dishes are quite nice, and generic enough that they could be repurposed for any number of things. Thankfully the color palette throughout is consistent, with little to speak of in terms of brightly colored internals for inexplicable reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The humble battle droid is coming up on its twenty-second year of service very shortly. A pair of these make for a very nice inclusion in my opinion; super battle droids would have disappeared into the tank droid&#39;s own color scheme and any other units would have likely been too specialized for those looking to army build this set. If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it.</p>

<p>The jet troopers are similarly simple, being nothing more than the standard The Clone Wars clone trooper with the addition of a jetpack.The part itself is pretty common these days but this is one of only two sets to include it in white. I like the inclusion of these figures as well; they provide the good guys a bit of a boost, if you will, in the face of what is clearly a villain-focused set. Were this set to be released today it would cost $50 instead of $25, to facilitate the inclusion of yet another oversized BARC speeder for the clones, because the bad guys can never have anything for themselves.</p>

<p>The jet troopers are a fun little way to spice up your clone army, and they can also be easily demoted to regular clones if you prefer uniform line-ups. Their generic nature promotes army building in the same way the standard battle droids do. No intrusive named characters to throw off the balance.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Tedious is the first word that comes to mind. I do not mind Technic at all and in fact embrace its inclusion in normal sets. However, I will admit a pet peeve of mine is Technic builds that center on axles that have to be aligned just so. Getting them perfectly centered to accommodate symmetrical components on either side always irritates me a little. Then of course there is the matter of attaching all fifty-six individual tread links to each other. Thankfully mine are all still intact, but with the way they connect together I can see the potential for the ends of one or more to snap off if you aren&#39;t careful. Other than that the build is just a matter of creating mirrored components and hooking them up to the center body. Tedious and a little repetitive.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>It sure looks like a Corporate Alliance Tank Droid. I&#39;m not a very big fan of the finished product as a toy, but as a display piece for your Clone Wars shelf or diorama it&#39;s good enough. Some issues:</p>

<p>The cardinal sin for a rolling toy, it can&#39;t roll on hard surfaces. Thanks to the &ldquo;cushion&rdquo; bricks on the bottom of the pontoons it will glide along just fine without damaging your floor, but the whole appeal of having the giant exposed tread is to see it move. It works wonderfully on carpet and other soft surfaces and makes a nice clicking sound thanks to the Technic gears involved, but it really is a shame this tank isn&#39;t all-terrain.</p>

<p>The whole thing feels pretty flimsy. The pontoons aren&#39;t locked in place and can very easily be knocked out of alignment when you pick it up, or even while it&#39;s rolling along. The tenuous and finicky connections on the eye stalks and cannons aren&#39;t fun either. In fact, the giant dishes themselves have a lot of play in their connections to the center body, both vertically and horizontally.</p>

<p>The lower rear is really oddly designed, with a mix of colors and textures filling out the gap between the main body and the back wheel. It doesn&#39;t look cohesive or even like it was meant to replicate some machine detailing and instead feels more like an oversight on the designers&#39; part.</p>

<p>Though not backed by any source material as far as I can tell, I really appreciated how the 2005 version of this droid had an interior pilot&#39;s seat that was cleverly hidden behind the dishes, to the point where you couldn&#39;t even tell it was there at a glance. I would have gladly sacrificed the thin profile of the main body and made it just a little wider if it had meant the inclusion of a similar mechanism here.</p>

<p>However, credit where credit is due: I appreciate the articulation in the eye stalks, even if the design isn&#39;t the best as I mentioned above. I like the design for the flick-fire missiles so that they both blend in with the stationary cannons above them and that when fired the vehicle does not look naked or unarmed. The droids have a place to stand on the front of the pontoons even if they are likely to get blown away by the cannons right behind them. And the rolling feature really is great fun when it works.</p>

<p>I absolutely love the printed dishes as well, I think their design has a lot of charm and they take care of all the need for detailing along the sides with just one piece.</p>

<p>There is also an innocuous side build in the form of a little catapult to launch the jet troopers from. Personally I haven&#39;t been able to get this to work effectively, they just end up flopping out right in front of the thing no matter how hard I slam down on the front. I do appreciate the effort, though, and that it is built entirely with parts from the tank droid&#39;s color scheme so if you don&#39;t like it you could conceivably cannibalize it to modify the droid.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I think this is probably the best of the three versions of this design LEGO has put out. The 2005 one has the fun cockpit feature but it is only part of a large and rare set, and in very strange colors to boot. The 2013 one was out of place in the Geonosis lineup, overly detailed and lacking the cool prints of the previous two, and was just a cynical way to get out the new Jango Fett minifigure.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re just looking for a fun set to pick up, this is definitely not for you. It&#39;s fiddly and lacking the wow factor or any really great play features. For the dedicated Clone Wars fan, now or in 2009, I could understand picking up a couple of these to fill out your Separatist ranks and your minifigure legions. It&#39;s a decent-sized model that looks the part and fits well with other artillery like the MTT or AAT.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re familiar with any of my more recent reviews, the lack of passion in my written voice here compared to in those is the best indicator I can give you that I&#39;m just lukewarm on this set.</p>
