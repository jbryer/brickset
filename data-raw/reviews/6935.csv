You get 5 Minifigs, Two Snowies, this is the cheapest set ever to come with them. 2 new rebel hoth troopers, with awesome new goggles. Hoth Han is also included.

You also get a TaunTaun, which is amazing. The Arms, Horns, Saddle and reins are all removable.

The snowies come with an E-WEB, and they put a whip to good use. Then onto the main fort. You get the small fort with a little grey container, and at the back is a device, which when you push down on it, the two rebels jump up, as if it were to explode. Seems the Imperials have sabotaged it.

The turrent has various funktions, for one, you can hide a rebel in it, then you can also seat one in the top, and it has flick-fire missiles, which can both be shot at once from the back.

Pros:
Snowies, Rebels
Tauntaun
Some useful pieces
Playability

Cons: 
Price is a bit steep for a set this small.
The fort could have been designed better.

Overall, I like this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"parchioso","2009-06-09T10:49:29.95Z","Buying a set is ok","After talking about the strange Tuan Tuan in 7749 in my blog, I think I can write a full review on the set.

Please check out my blog on my observation on the Tuan Tuan, which is rather negative:
http://brickand.me/2009/06/07/StrangeTuanTuanFrom7749EchoBase.aspx

In short, I think the Tuan Tuan is just too cute to be Star-War.

Aside from the cutie Tuan Tuan, this set comes with Han Solo, two Hoth Rebels and two Storm troopers, in terms of number of minifigs this set is a good deal, but to rebuild the battle of Hoth? I think this idea has been around for years, but after seeing many of such great work in Flickr, I gave up any attempt to do it, as there seems to be no point in repeating something that many others have done so well, especially when doing so requires a lot of money.

The Hoth Rebels now share the same white pants with the Storm Troopers, I think it was grey in the movie, not sure why they changed it for the Rebels starting in 7666. And they also get a new pair of Aviator Goggles, seems in line with the latest fashion trend, but somehow looks funny in battle scene though.

Beside the minifigs, the rest are slight variation from the counterparts in 7666, the missile-firing defense turret can house a rebel, but honestly I never appreciate those firing missile mechanism, which I doubt even how many young kids would care to play with. The springboard mechanism is also ridiculous, why would a Hoth rebel do that for?

This set is fair in pricing, but since the new Tuan Tuan is a disappointment, the rest are just copied from 7666 with no new surprise, buying a set is ok, but seeing some local folks buying half a dozen of it, I really can't understand their passion.

"andy94","2009-06-25T10:33:55.187Z","The empire stikes back!","I bought this set a few days ago for 27 euros. When I saw the price I was a bit disappointed: Why does a 155-pieces set cost so much? Despite this, I picked it up anyway. First of all, the name of the set is totally wrong. You can easily notice that it isn't a ""base"", but something like a wall and a turret. 
The instructions are split up in 5 sections: the minifigures, the tauntaun, the E-web blaster, the wall and the turret.

INSTRUCTIONS and BUILDING
There isn't a lot to say about the instructions, they are quite simple (it is a small set) and in the last pages there are pictures of the new clone wars-classic star wars sets and a lot of small images of all the minifigures included inside them (interesting the mon calamari picture). The building is even easier, only a complain: putting the flick-fire missiles in the small white piece on the rear of the turret is a bit difficult, mostly because you risk to break it

MINIFIGURES
The main part of the set. Five of them are included, two are snowtroopers, basically normal stormtroopers with a different helmet attached to the backpack (it is all one piece). They have a regular black head and a cool new torso. I think this is the cheapest way to get snowies at the moment (the AT-AT is really expensive). The rebel soldiers are the same as those in the snowspeeder set, but with an other color scheme, the legs, instead of grey, are white. The main innovation is the visor, more realistic and cooler, even if it is a bit too big if you put it in front of the soldiers'eyes. You get also an extra one, which I gave to my old rebel soldier. Han Solo is a copy of that in the X-wing, exept for the beige legs. He has a new (I think) blue snow cape, which is great. Finally, the Tauntaun (the grey animal), when I saw it I was very disappointed. Like the horses, it is composed of one unique piece, plus the horns and the arms. I don't like it a lot, it is rather ugly, but it is still interesting for collectors. Its saddle can keep Han Solo's blaster. Four weapons are included: three small guns and one big. Unfortunately, one snowtrooper remains without anything.

E-WEB, TURRET, WALL
The E-web is really cool looking, but it is also REALLY unstable. A small transparent brick keep it up form the ground and the three small antennas ""try"" to make it more realistic. In fact, these are difficult to set and when you move the blaster they go immediately out of position.The E-web is connected to the generator by a black whip, like those in the old castle sets, it can rotate, too. The turret is quite good, but the main body is too small. It can be opened, I suggest to use it only to store things, instead of putting a rebel soldier, simply there isn't enough space. The upper part is, instead, too big. A small door on the top allow you to set a rebel soldier, but don't expect much, you can only put it sat, the space inside is one-brick thick. Finally the annoying flick-fire missiles. You have to shoot them pushing a long white brick on the rear, which is connected to two other bricks that push the missiles. As usual, they don't go far. Eventually, the wall; it is made of regular bricks and there is space to put two soldiers. Just inside of it there is a little brown catapult which is supposed to launch the rebels in the air when used, but this doesn't happen, the launching system is too small. I suggest to remove it, you will earn some extra space. The turret and the wall are connected by a rubber-plastic black ""whip"".

PROS
plenty of minifigures (finally regular soldiers)
great turret and wall
cool looking E-web blaster

CONS
too expensive (27 euros=35-40$)
ugly tauntaun 
strange main body of the turret
stupid catapult
flick fire missiles
no blaster for one snowtrooper
OVERALL
A great set, not a must buy, but if you are a star wars fan you have to pick it up, especially for the snowies. Fits perfectly with others Hoth sets (7666 and 4500). I think that it could have been done better, I complain mostly about the tauntaun and the useless space inside the turret. Anyway it remains a great original trilogy set.

"AFOSL","2009-07-03T18:02:30.153Z","Excellent But Only Just Worth It's Price Tag","Echo Base has been a long awaited release, purely for one reason.  For a long time fans have been crying out for an animal that has had a great deal of recognition for almost thirty years.  Ever since Lego first produced a Star Wars creature figurine in 2000 with the release of 7115, Gungan Patrol we have waited for a Tauntaun.<br><br>The Tauntaun figure is actually very similar in production design to the Kaadu, being two halves cemented together.  This design does leave a small seam, but it doesn't detract from the looks of the model and is almost invisible compared to early teaser pictures of the creature that circulated the web prior to the release of Echo Base.  Even the box art depicts the Tauntaun having a canyon like seam running it's entire length.<br>Unlike the Kaadu from 7115, the Tauntaun requires a small amount of assembly - the fitting of it's arms and horns - and it also has eyes printed on to the figure, something the Kaadu never had.  A saddle and harness and reins also require attaching, and with that the Tauntaun assembly is complete.  <br>It's a very nice and welcome addition to the range of Star Wars Lego beasts.<br><br>The rest of the kit centers on the trench and turret.  Hardly a base, but Echo Trench and Turret just doesn't have the same ring to it!<br>The construction is solid and quite simple.  It's also very small and utilizes very few parts, something I'll come onto later.<br>The Turret contains two flick fire missiles which are actually quite difficult to fire any distance and they tend to just pathetically fall mere inches from their launch.  The laser system from 7666 Hoth Rebel Base worked a lot better.<br>The main body of the Turret opens up and allows a figure to be concealed inside, and although separated by a turntable and plate, the rotating head has an opening top hatch and space to sit a minifigure.  <br>Overall, the turret is of a nice design that works well - if you forget about the flick fire missiles.<br>The turret connects to the trench via a length of ribbed rubber tubing, depicting one of the many power cables running the length of the Hoth trench in the movie.<br>The trench is nicely constructed using very few parts and contains storage crate and rocking floor.  This floor enables the user to send their rebel troops flying in the event of a direct hit from the Empire.<br><br>5 minifigures are included in this set - two Hoth Rebels, 2 Snowtroopers and Han in full Hoth gear.  At this price point it is the cheapest a Hoth Han and Snowtroopers have ever been available for direct from Lego.  These figures previously appeared in more expensive sets, such as 7666 Hoth Rebel Base and 4504 Millennium Falcon.  The Han figure in this set does have a hood and this differentiates him from the Han figures that come in the other sets and makes him more unique.<br>This set marks the fourth outing for the Hoth rebel trooper and marks yet another change.  This trooper sports a new pair of goggles - bigger than the last type, they cover much more of the figure's face and to my eye, look better when placed in the up position, sitting on the figure's helmet.<br>Despite four different Hoth rebels and three goggle designs released over the years, the first being a neat brown visor, Lego have never got this figure 100% correct.  The troops in the film wear green goggles.  So what should Lego Hoth troops wear?  Should they still use the goggles or should they sport a new visor in translucent green?<br>With a potential new line up of Hoth sets in 2010, to celebrate 30 years of Empire Strikes Back, the Hoth rebel might get another change.  Who knows?<br>The Imperial troops are excellent as always, with their unique masks and breathing apparatus faithfully reproduced once again.  The Imperials have an E-Web laser which is slightly different in design to the one contained in 7666.  This E-Web has it's own power pack and is connected by a thin cable.  The cable is actually a minifig whip (Peeron 2488) molded in black and it looks very effective. <br><br>If I have one complaint with this set it's in it's price to piece ratio.  This set reminds me of set 4501 Mos Eisley Cantina, released in 2004.  Set 4501 consisted of a large box which seemed to contain too few parts, yet carried a rather cheeky price tag.  Echo Base has those hallmarks. <br>The box is of similar size to 4501, it contains a creature molding, which I'm sure is not cheap to produce, and when open, the box seems half empty.  And although it does contain fewer parts and is at least Â£6.00 cheaper than 4501 ever was, it still seems to be a bit more expensive than it should be.  <br>Although this set finally brings the fans the excellent Tauntaun, it brings it at a price that some fans will just be unwilling to pay.  <br>Despite the price to piece ratio issue, making it very hard to judge, I want to give this set full marks.  The set is good and the Tauntaun is really excellent and makes up most of the points, helping to reduce the sting of opening a half empty box.  If Lego had gotten the Tauntaun wrong, this set would have fallen early on and would have cost Lego dearly - a lot more than any fan buying one or two for themselves, which no doubt, many will.",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"chonkan","2009-07-01T11:55:36.25Z","finally another hoth set!!","This set is a brilliant set! I really like this because its good to add to Hoth rebel base but also you get a TAUNTAUN!! 

When I found out this set had come out i was like ""I need to have this set"" so when i got it off LEGO.com I couldn't wait to open it. It's fun to build, great figures like hoth han with HOOD! 

I think adding the hood was a good idea, rebels have new goggles, snowies are great, you get some really good bits with this so I really recommend this set but now I'm gonna go through pros and cons:

pros:
- tauntaun
- hoth han
- 2 rebels and 2 snowies
- the turret is nicely detailed 
- good bits with the set
- lots of things to do with it so its great for play

cons:
- the missiles on the turret are really hard to flick out at the snowies
- the snowie with turret should have a gun even though he has a turret 

Apart from that everything is fine

"Darth_Shockwave","2009-08-12T20:22:46.653Z","A Nice set, but wrong name.","After hearing the announcement of Echo Base form Lego, I was really excited. I thought great we will get a hanger deck big enough for a Snowspeeder, several troopers, a pilot or 2 and maybe a command centre, maybe it would an add on set for the Hoth Rebel Base. When I saw the pictures though, I was slightly disappointed. However, this is exactly the type of set me and a friend of mine discussed years earlier, we had discussed a Hoth battle pack featuring a small trench, a couple of troops on either side, and maybe a Taun Taun.

Not too say this is a bad set though, it's just not named correctly, it should really be named Hoth Battle pack or something. This set does work brilliantly with the previous Hoth Rebel base, and the addition of extra troops for both sides is always a plus. The main selling points for this set are deffinatly the Taun Taun and figures. I hope Lego do another Taun Taun set featuring Luke adn maybe a Wampa cave.

Pro's 
Taun Taun
Snowtroopers (in a much cheaper set)
Hoth Troopers
Looks very nice with Hoth Reble base
Anti personal cannon, especially the seat and secret room
Hoth Han (he should really come with black hands though to show gloves)

Con's
Incorrectly named
A bit pricey for what you actually get
Rebel trooper heads could of had different expresions.

Overall I do like this set, especially because it was what I had talked about a few years ago. The Taun Taun figure is great, and it's a nice troop builder set, with additional attachments.

"David1971","2009-07-24T15:07:01.183Z","Nice smallish set, expensive obviously, but nice","The snowy wastes of the planet Hoth are obviously a lovely setting for Lego Star Wars action. The minifigures here are great, especially the men with classic smiling faces, and Han in snowy gear, all very nice. The Lego tauntaun is great of course.

The other stuff in the set, which can be crudely categorised under ""weapons and furniture"", is not that amazing for a Â£21 (UK) set, as everybody has noticed. But it's not bad, and there's enough pieces to construct different items of, er, weapons and furniture.

Overall a very nice set, although if you pretend you've paid Â£16.50 for the set itself, which might seem reasonable, and also made a Â£5 donation to Lego for being such a nice company, which was nice of you, then you'll probably feel happier about the whole thing.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Brock_the_Builder","2009-07-14T14:27:58.543Z","Great Minifigs, Set is just okay","I picked this set up today at my local Lego store after much anticipation.  The minifigs are very cool, especially the snowtroopers.  Han in snow gear is also a nice touch and his helmet is straight from the Arctic line.  The Rebel soldiers are also FULLY outfitted with backpacks, helmets, goggles, weapons-- the whole nine!  They even have the classic lego smiley faces, albeit in the new light flesh color.  I'm not a fan of this skin color, but it is applicable to the cold conditions, so it's okay here.  The Taun-Taun is also cool, although he is smaller than I was expecting.  He should be slightly bigger IMO.

As for the set, it is kind of a joke.  Almost every Lego set has some sort of trick or features.  2 of the 3 main features on this set do not work:  1. The missiles do not fire (they just fall out) and 2. The eject platform for the rebel troopers does nothing (they just fall over).  The turret opens up, but there's nothing inside.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I can build this base with loose parts I have laying around. The only specialty part is the black hose.  Same goes for the snowtroopers' gun-- you can easily build this with pieces you already have.

That being said, should you still buy this set?  Absolutely.  The figures alone make it worth at least a $15.  Add another $10 for the cheap little base and the Star Wars nameplate, and voila:  $25.  I realize now, if they priced this set any lower, they wouldn't be able to keep it on the shelves.

"chantastic","2009-07-25T23:00:23.747Z","you're paying for the figs and tauntaun","This is a really small set. When I opened the box I thought I was missing a bag or two but I wasn't. There just aren't that many pieces to it. The size of the box and the price of the set are kind of misleading. The name ""Echo Base"" is also a bit misleading as it's really just part of the trench surrounding the base plus a turret.

Parts of this set are redundant with parts of 7666 Hoth Rebel Base. The tripod gun is nearly identical to the one in 7666 and the turret canon is actually inferior to the one in 7666 (it's smaller and doesn't look as nice).

So if you already have 7666, what you're really paying for in this set are the minifigs and the tauntaun. And it's actually not a bad deal considering how much these figs would go for on the secondary market. Say you sell the tauntaun and Hoth Han Solo for $15 total. Effectively you paid $10 for two snowtroopers and 2 Hoth rebels. It's basically a Hoth army builder set.

Isn't weird that LEGO is BACKORDERED on the set, and a retailer like Target has like 25 of them? But, who cares! This is a SUPERB set, and I was really happy when my daddy threw it in the shopping cart!

The 10th Anniversary sets are really classic. They are ONLY going to be in production in 2009, and that is what makes it rare! As many Brickset members have pointed out, $24.99 is a BIT of a high price. The size and the content value of the set is a bit small, but listen. You rarely get FIVE mini-figures in a twenty-dollar set, and I've noticed that most of the 2009 Star Wars anniversary sets have a $5 ""collector"" fee!

Now, here is the pros and the cons of this great set. Cons can't MATCH up to the wonderness of this set!

Pros:

*5 minifigures! Han Solo in Hoth Wear, two Rebel Troopers (NEW DESIGN), and two Snowtroopers!

*Great build!

*4 laserguns!

*Flick fire missle gun!

*Secret passage for a mini-figure to stand in below the missle gun!

*Buildable E-web for one of the Snowtroopers!

*It's HILARIOUS to see the 2 Rebel Troopers FLY off their stand when you press down the white plate button!

Cons:

*$25 is a little high price

*Flick fire missle gun can sometimes fall apart from the Echo Base

I really enjoy this set. No, I didn't enjoy it. That's a lie.

I decided to take a break from clone wars and pick up on the OT sets. WOW, is all I had to say. This set is great in every sense. The figures are incredible and best of all, we finally se an E-web turret. The taun-taun is so inovative, I would go as far as to calling it the next Lego horse. I mean there are absolutely no flaws on this figure. The new rebels are clearly happy about fighting in snow trenches. While their goggle cover their face. The snow troopers are great in every sense. 

Pros:
Great minifigures

In this set it comes with little trench where the rebels came be safe from enemy fire. it has a bench in it so the rebels can look over the top but also it is a exploding effect. When you hit the end of the bench it flings the rebels in the air from an explotion. It also comes with turrent which can be connected to the base. you can open the turrent on the sides to put the rebels in there to control it or be safe in it. You can also put the rebel on the top but you cant close it when hes in the top but can be seated. it also come with missles on the sides of the turrent beside the laser cannon. You just press the button on the back and does not fire that good. Next is the snowtroopers laser cannon which is pretty lame. the wire piece that connects to the cannon and the brick piece is a whip. the laser cannon itself is not that sturdy. the mini figs are awsome. the snowtroopers. they come with a helmet which is connected to the backpack so you cant leave the helmet on and take the backpack off. their torsos are very well done too. The rebels are on ok but look like a normal man with snow clothes. they come with googles yhat goes way to low so their face looks messed up. and han solo is a great mini fig. he come with a detailed hood and body. if you put a brown hair piece on him then he looks even better. and last but not least the tauntaun. he is a cool extra in this set. there is 5 pieces to him( his 2 arms , 2 horns and body) you can put the little saddle on him which comes with this set on him or just leave it off. the only con about the tauntaun. is his feet dont move but his arms move.

"timqua","2009-08-28T02:36:31.153Z","Overpriced","I got this set after finally finding it in the store. Apparently, it is highly desired and hard to find. It is a good set, but it shouldn't be more than 20 dollars. I guess Lego feels the Tuan Tuan is the valuable.

The build is quick and straight-forward. This is really for quick play or rebuild Hoth Battles. It has a nice amount of figures (5), with good snow troopers. Although the new visors for the rebel troops look better, they don't fit particularly well on the helmets. The bunker is small and really wouldn't serve for much protection--I guess that's why it has a flick mechanism to launch the rebel troops in the air! But this works very well and sends the troops flying. The flick-fire missiles, on the other hand, are terrible. They go no where and Peter Pan imagination is necessary to make them a playable part of the set.

The Tuan Tuan is well detailed and stands on a Lego base well. I was nicely surprised about this. Han has a tough time holding the binocs or his gun and the reins at the same time.

The snow troopers' cannon has a clear piece that allows it to stand properly with the three antennae ""legs,"" this is an improvement from the blaster cannon which came with the snowtrooper in the 4904 MF set.

I was disappointed with the overall inclusions of this set, but as a Lego collector I guess it is a must own--especially since it is apparently so hard to find sometimes. (I actually got an extra set that is to remain in its box in case it become sought after in a few years). I would like to have seen it 20 bucks vs 25, but for the amount of figures, I guess this is expected.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Crazybrick45","2009-12-26T13:16:52.607Z","Imperial troops have entered the base! Imperial troops have-","How. Cool. IS. THIS. I just got this for Christmas yesterday, opened it up, built it.. meh you dont wanna hear that part lets get on to the review.

Part 1: Minifigures/Accessories
This set contains 2 snowtrooper, 2 rebel troopers(hoth) and the rare Han Solo in hoth gear! The snowtroopers have their usual attire with the boba-fett style backpack-attached-to-helmet helmet. The rebel troopers both have regular white backpacks, and they sport new goggles, but they don't work aswel as the older ones. Han has a tan holster pattern legs with dark navy blue belt. He also has his hood headpeice. The set comes with 3 small blasters and 1 of the longer ones. This set also has the very first lego tauntaun. It has movable arms, aswell as horns. It comes with a saddle and reigns so that a minifig can ride on it. Again, there is a small turret for the snowtrooper. It is connected to a power pack by means of a whip piece.

Part 2: The Trench 
The trench is, basically, a barricade. It has a little spring feature that you can use to throw the rebel toopers up, a sort of battle-action feature. There is also a small box inside of the trench which i assume is ment for rations and stuff like that. There is a tube coming out from the front of the trench that connects to the cannon.

Part 3: The Cannon
In my opinion, this is the coolest part of the set. Like i said earlier there is a tube connecting this to the trench. You can open up the cannon and put a minifig inside but i dont really see the purpose of it. The cannon has 2 flick fire missiles beside the main barrel. You can open the hatch up at the top and put a minifig inside to fire the cannon.

Hold and behold, the mini figures that I missed out are the thing that made this set fantastic. I love the Tuantuan with Hansolo riding it, snow troopers are also awesome. I do love the torret gun's design but was disappointed as it breaks of easily specially when you try to open the hidden compartment. There is also not much of an Echo base to beggin with, just a mare defense wall for two mini figure to hide at. What I did now is bought a couple more of these set as there was a buy 2 get 1 free promo on our local Fred Meyer, then I bought more of the base itself for a cheap price on a bidding website. With some white brick at my disposal I build me a Echo base with a bunch of Torret. Now I cay the battle beggins.

- Tauntaun

Stupid introduction, I know, but bear with me.<br><br>Intro: Whenever a Hoth set based on Episode V comes out, I get all giddy. Usually, I set my expectations a little too high, and this time was no exception. But of course, the Taun Taun was the clencher for me. I needed that animal to help complete my Lego Star Wars Universe. So, being the sucker I am, I waltzed up to the register and forked over 25 crisp, green bills, and walked out with a white bag emblazoned with the Target logo. Inside, was set #7749: Echo Base.<br><br>Packaging: The box is beautiful, with the 10th Anniversary logo shining on the front, reminding me of the fun I had putting together classic Star Wars sets from the early years. The Taun-Taun is showed on the box, but the seam is much more prominent there than it is on the actually piece. It looks like the Grand Canyon on the box photo, but in the set it's hardly noticeable. Other than that, the box art is very nice, kudos to whoever designed it. (Greg Hyland?)<br><br>Minifigs: No new minifigs here, but there are some variations on old ones. Han Solo is in his Hoth fatigue gear, and this is his first time with a parka and not hair. He also has a new face. Maybe no one else noticed this, but his eyes (at least in my set) were very offset to the right under the eyebrows. He looks like he's glancing at something. Maybe that was intentional, but I'm not crazy about it. The Snowtroopers are the same as they've always been, but they're still nice figures. Some have requested Snowtroopers with detached backpacks, but I don't think they would work as well or look as good this way. Also, they have the standard black head for anyone who was wondering. The new Hoth troopers are pretty cool. They're not completely new, but the helmets and goggles are. I've already replaced my heads, because I can't stand the standard smiley in flesh. I don't know why, but it works in yellow, just not in flesh. The standout fig of the set, if it can be called a fig, is the Taun-Taun. It has been long-awaited and expected, as evidenced by the dozens of blocky custom models from years past. The body is one piece with nice printed eyes, but the horns, saddle, and bit must be placed on separately. Mine came in a translucent plastic bag, much as the Ewoks from the Battle of Endor set did. An awesome figure, indeed.<br><br>The Build: A pretty quick but sturdy build, reminiscent of the battle packs, only a bit bigger. I'm not a big fan of the tan headlight bricks, so I've already replaced them with white ones. The turret is much different from the Hoth Base set, and while it's not bad as a standalone, the other, in my opinion, much more accurate. It's a pretty hard set to break, and while the flipping mechanism behind the bunker may be a little juvenile, it's a nice touch for the younger kids.<br><br>Conclusion: A set that's only slightly overpriced, a trend that Lego seems to be sticking to as of late. The Taun-Taun makes it a must-buy, and the other figs and E-Web are also great for a collector. That being said, the final rating is 4.5/5.<br><br>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4

"vynsane","2010-05-24T12:31:39.17Z","Echo 3 to Echo 7... Han old buddy, do you read me?","I'm glad to have the opportunity to grab this set for a great price this week ($15 at Target, starting 5/23/10) as it's mere days since the 30th anniversary of the release of The Empire Strikes Back (THE best Star Wars movie)! The sale price skews the 'Value for money' rating higher than it would normally rate. Had I purchased this at full-price you'd be looking at a 2 to 3 brick value as opposed to a 5.<div><br></div><div><h4>Figures</h4><div>Counting the Taun Taun this set weighs in at 6 minifigures, which is pretty great both for playability in and of itself, but also for army building. At the price I paid, picking up two would give you quite a battlepack, and a second Taun Taun for you to give to Hoth Luke in the forthcoming Hoth Wampa Cave!</div><div><ul><li><b>Han Solo (Hoth Gear) -&nbsp;</b>Han's blue parka cold climate outfit is well represented here, though the face doesn't scream 'Han' in the same way as the Indiana Jones face perfectly personifies that character. It seems just a little too plain and generic, though the smile is turned into a representation of Han's signature smirk.</li><li><b>Taun Taun</b> - Han's 'steed' is a brand-new item included in this set, which consists of five parts: the main body, two arms, and two horns.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Hoth Rebel Soldier</b>&nbsp;(x2) - The detailing on the torso is superb and the colors are right on. The generic 'smiley' head is a bit of a let-down, but not a huge problem.</li><li><b>Imperial Snowtrooper</b>&nbsp;(x2) - Once again, the torso print is magnificent. The sculpt on the helmet/backpack piece is also fantastic, really selling the whole package.</li></ul><h4>Accessories</h4></div></div><div>There are more than enough accessories for all the figures in this set. I think Han should have come with his standard issue blaster pistol, but other than that the accessories are well-rounded. Mix and match to your taste, but the assignments per the instructions are below.</div><div><ul><li><b>Standard Blaster Rifle</b> (x3) - assigned to one Rebel Trooper, one Snowtrooper and Han</li><li><b>Macrobinoculars</b> (x1) - assigned to Han</li><li><b>Heavy Blaster Rifle</b> (x1) - assigned to the other Rebel Trooper</li><li><b>Tripod-mounted Imperial ""E-Web"" Heavy Repeating Blaster Cannon</b>&nbsp;(x1) - brick-built, assigned to the other Snowtrooper</li><li><b>Saddle</b> (x1) and;</li><li><b>Bridle</b> (x1) - both assigned to the Taun Taun ;)</li></ul><h4>Build</h4></div><div>The build is rather short, as the set only weighs in at 155 pieces. The Snowtroopers only get a brick-built assault cannon which looks cool despite its spindly-looking tripod. Since they're the faction pushing the assault, there isn't much cover for them to duck behind. The Rebels get a more fortified emplacement with a wall that looks like it's made out of reinforced ice (part of the outer defense perimeter of Echo Base) and a heavy ""DF.9"" Anti-Infantry Battery turret. The turret's top hatch can open to accommodate a seated Rebel Trooper, and the turret's column can also house a trooper. Alternatively, either or both of the troopers can stand behind the wall, though this is ill-advised as the main 'action feature' of the set is a hinge-mounted plate that causes the troopers to fly in the air in spectacular fashion (presumably) after an attack from the Imperial W-Web Assault Cannon. The other action feature is a pair of flick-fire missiles on the cannon turret, adjacent to the main cannon barrel on either side. A single push-bar on the back of the turret fires the missiles simultaneously, though (as with most FFM's) the effect is not nearly as impressive as the 'explosion' feature.</div><div><br></div><h4>Authenticity</h4><div>While the E-Web cannon's spindly tripod doesn't very accurately convey the heft of the 'real' thing, and the rebel turret isn't nearly as thick and heavy looking, they never-the-less depict their respective source materials well enough in LEGO fashion to make it believable.</div><div><br></div><h4>Parts</h4><div>Aside from the new Taun Taun, this set is made of relatively standard pieces. As it takes place on an 'ice world' the color palette is rather sparse, consisting of mainly white with some light tan, light blue-gray, a smattering of dark brown and the odd black piece. Unique pieces include the turntable connection for the turret and the black 'power cable'. As there are a multitude of small parts, there is also a wealth of extra parts (including one white and one brown 1x1 cheese wedge, an extra 'robot arm' and 'Rebel Hoth Helmet' visor in white, a black antenna/lever, and a black 'robot claw'.</div><div><br></div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>The final verdict is positive, over-all.

The Tauntaun is great, but if you want a weapon to fire while on the Tauntaun, it doesn't do well. The snowtroopers are good, as usual. The E-Web looks real cool, and I put two little hand things on so the trooper can turn the E-Web on. finally, the Playability is allright, with it cannon that used one piece to fire both, even though I just press both on there own.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-14T12:44:27.173Z","The Rebels are There","<p>Set #7749 Echo Base: Aside from a horrible misnomer for this set it is a definite must have and here's why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all this set marks the first ever LEGO Tauntaun animal, and that alone is well worth the price of admission. (In 2010 LEGO gave us the Wampa, does anyone else hope and pray that 2011 will finally include a Jabba's Dungeon set complete with LEGO Rancor?) This set also gives you five Mini-Figures, but it is not Echo Base, in fact I'd say it's more of part of the trench defense for the base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get to build up a small protective trench and a large weapon's tower of some kind, plus one E-Web Blaster for the Snowtroopers. The build doesn't take very long and once it's done you have a nice white display piece for your Empire Hoth battle display. With a few play gimmicks included for good measure. First of all the large tower weapon has two flick-fire missiles, only instead of flicking them you push on a piece in the back that fires them both simultaneously. (In theory at any rate, mine suffers a bit from lack of operation, it tends to not want to fire the missiles.) The weapon base can also open up for one of the Hoth Rebel Soldiers to go inside of it and hide or perhaps man the weapon, though that would probably be the job of the other HRS who can stand in the upper portion of the weapon when the top panel is lifted up on the two Droid arms used during construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trench base is designed to launch the poor unsuspecting Hoth Rebel Soldiers into the air, as though being struck down by the AT-AT fire from the battle or perhaps the E-Web Blaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get two Snowtroopers, two Hoth Rebel Soldiers and one Hoth Han Solo with pink skin tone to go with this set, all in all a very impressive group of Mini-Figures. The Tauntaun is a wonderful new creature, put him (or her, I'm not sure if the Tauntaun was male or female that Han used.) next to any LEGO Horses and it'll look very strange, but also very funny and fun. Accessory-wise you are given four blasters, one set of macrobinoculars, a brown saddle and the head-gear for each Mini-Figure. Many of them are really nice pieces, I especially like the White Backpack piece, sure it's the same one we've all seen in brown with Pirates, but the new color improves upon it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this set is worth picking up and owning, even all by itself it's still fun to build and play with, but hopefully soon I'll be able to add Hoth Wampa Cave, Snowtrooper Battle Pack, Hoth Rebel Soldier Battle Pack and the Imperial AT-AT from this year to my Hoth display and thus enhance this set even further. A wonderful set with many good points and as I said before I've got my fingers crossed that in 2011 we'll finally see the LEGO Rancor in all it's LEGO glory.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

So when I came out of my Dark Ages collecting all the Hoth sets was my first priority. I picked up this set after buying Hoth Base 7879 and Rebel Base 7666 (both have reviews by Chills as well). Like those sets, this set has its pluses and minuses, however I think it could definitely have been better.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The minifigures are pretty cool. Two rebel soldiers, two snowtroopers, Han in his Hoth parka and a Tauntaun. All great additions to your collection, and if you are building a Hoth battle scene these little guys are also good to have.</li><li>Pro 2: There is decent playability with this small set. The turret has flick fire missiles, though you push a button on the back to make them pop out. The rebel soldiers also pop off their platform as it hit by blaster fire. And you get an E-Web heavy gun for the snow troopers. This gun comes in most Hoth sets, so you'll have plenty if you collect them all.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1:&nbsp;This set is part of a pivotal battle in Star Wars, and there are some glaring inaccuracies. The shape of turret/cannon is all wrong. The vertical body walls should be canted in, and the body should be stouter, it is too thin. The turret is too small, it should be larger, wider. The gun barrel is too short and stubby. The one in the movie is long and thin. Unfortunately LEGO missed the mark with this part of the set.</li><li>Con 2: The rebel soldiers' helmets are the old type before Lego made the real-looking ones. The helmets in this set are round, and look nothing like the ones in the movies. The helmets from the soldiers in the battle pack 8083 are much more accurate.</li><li>Con 3: The price of this set is pretty steep for only 155 pieces. I can understand if you get some great minifigures, but this set is like a big battle pack, but priced much higher.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Since I am a big Hoth fan I must have all the Hoth sets, even this one. Honestly, it isn't a terrific set. One can MOC a better turret gun than this. And you can get a Tauntaun in other sets; same with Rebel soldiers and snow troopers. Unless you're must have every Hoth set, or really want this set for your Hoth collection I would say you can pass on it. For the same price I suggest getting the Imperial and Rebel Hoth soldier battle packs, you get more soldiers for your battles. I am hopeful that LEGO will come out with a really good Hoth set that does justice to Episode V as it has done with many other terrific sets.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,2

But this set sadly wasn't as good as I was expecting, so I'll explain why.<div><br></div><div>The build was rather boring and basic to be fair with little interesting techniques or parts.

The Han Solo figure was really nice and I thought his hood was cleverly done. The snowtroopers were my first Imperial troopers so I was very excited about them (until my army grew too big). Their helmets looked fantastic and I was fascinated by them. Lastly, the tauntaun was the star of the show for this set, showing what LEGO can achieve if they work hard at it. I love that figure and I now have two thanks to the Hoth Echo Base so both Luke and Han can ride around Hoth together!</div><div><br></div><div>The cannon that belonged to the Empire is quite inventive and fun, giving the Imperials something to fight with. The main build though, the turret and barrier, is not very sturdy and could do with some more support.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If the set didn't include the tauntaun and included a rebel trooper the price would probably match that of a battle pack. For the price I paid it's a decent set but at Â£25 it's a bit expensive for what you get. If you want a good Hoth battle, I'd buy it.

I like that a figure can sit in the top. The only weak point is the door in the turret that could simply do with another hinge to feel less flimsy.</p><p>The <b>bunker</b> is great, just the right size, and with a really great feature: stand the figures in it, and push down on the hinged part and they fly up in the air as if the bunker has been shelled! I buy my Lego for display, but I couldn't resist shooting the rebels up in the air over and over again! It is a little fragile, in that bits come off the mechanism, but they're not hard to put back on so it's not so bad.</p><p>The imperial's <b>web gun</b> is also really good, only small but looking just right, and not all suffering for the lack of actual missiles (see 7666 where the web gun was very poor).</p><p>And the <b>figures</b> you get are great - I love Han's hood, and to have a Tauntaun in a set this price is great! There's not much to say about the snowtroopers and rebels, except that the rebels could do with proper faces.</p>

<ul><li>Great bunker with brilliant explosion feature</li><li>Great looking turret gun</li><li>Good troop booster</li><li>Han on his Tauntaun! Brilliant!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>A few bits are fragile, but nothing too drastic</li><li>The set is pre-rebels-have-faces so they're just smiling&nbsp;inanely</li></ul>
<p>This is a fantastic little set. I had to get it second hand as I wrote it off alongside the silly made-up 8083 and 8084 - I wish I hadn't! It's properly movie accurate and is a really excellent battle pack - extra figures, but with a film-accurate bunker, turret, web gun (none of your silly white speeder bikes! Where did they come from?), and even a Tauntaun! I can't think of any reason not to get one, in fact I'm very tempted to get another...</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Taggerung1","2013-12-05T22:23:37.14Z","A few mistakes, but a good set.","I'll start by saying that this set, for a Battle Pack type set, meets most of my requirements.&nbsp; It comes with basic soldier minifigures, and no officer minifigures.&nbsp; Usually I would prefer a set like this just focus on one army, so that you could get, say, four rebel soldiers or four Snowtroopers.&nbsp; And in this case that holds true.&nbsp; If you're going to call a set Echo Base, it should be just Echo Base.<br>If they'd called it ""Battle of Hoth"" or something, then it would totally make sense to have Snowtroopers in the set as well.&nbsp; But okay, I get what they were going for.&nbsp; Let's examine the set one part at a time though.<br><h4>Examination:</h4><p>The Hoth turret is very nice, and the flick fire missiles, which I normally hate, in this case are not too obtrusive.&nbsp; They are still a pain to fire, but I just don't bother with them.&nbsp; I'm not sure why the turret opens like it does.&nbsp; The bottom part is.. what, to stick a minifig inside?&nbsp; There's nothing in there for them to do.&nbsp; And the top hatch is cool, but there's no room inside for anything.&nbsp; I do like the 4x4 spinner plate it used though.&nbsp; That's cool.&nbsp; I find myself wishing the main gun could aim up and down though.&nbsp; Overall, I like the turret.&nbsp; It deserves a point.<br></p><p>The Rebel's trenchy snow fort thing is not bad.&nbsp; They did have those in the movie, and it's cool to have a Lego one that looks okay.&nbsp; What I really like though, is the explodey thing, where you can launch the Rebel troops head over bricks.&nbsp; Always a major consideration for me, especially in Star Wars sets, is the explodeability factor.&nbsp; This one certainly scores a point for having explodeability built into the design, and done well.</p><p>Han Solo and the Tauntaun.&nbsp; Honestly, this is the worst thing about the set.&nbsp; This is a Battle Pack.&nbsp; These are meant to be bought so that we can build our armies of Stormtroopers and Rebels and such.&nbsp; We do not want to build our army of Han Solos.&nbsp; (do we?)&nbsp; Now, to be clear, I think the Tauntaun is cool.&nbsp; It's about time he got us a Lego Tauntaun.&nbsp; But they should have put another Rebel soldier in the set to ride the Tauntaun instead of Han.&nbsp; And then another Snowtrooper, maybe on a speeder bike to balance it out.&nbsp; And that would also have made the set closer to being worth the price it cost.&nbsp; Here in Canada, the thing cost $30, which is about twice what it's worth.&nbsp; Minus half a point for Han Solo.&nbsp; Minus another half point for the price.<br></p><p>The other minifigs are great.&nbsp; Not much to say about them: they are the basic foot soldiers <br>for the armies in that battle, and that is exactly what I want in a Battle Pack.&nbsp; Point for the soldiers.</p><p>The equipment you get in the set is all good.&nbsp; A nice number of blasters, a crate to hold blasters, and even an E-web blaster turret for the Snowtroopers.&nbsp; It's good, but as with the speeder bikes and droidekas, I wish they'd just make them all the same.&nbsp; I know they have to update them eventually, but they don't need to make a new version for every set.&nbsp; Still, point for having the right number of blasters, and some cool extras.&nbsp; And for the fact that you can make the Tauntaun hold a blaster.</p><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Cool Turret.</li><li>Explodeable Trench.</li><li>Good selection of soldiers and equipment.</li><li>Tauntaun.</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Han Solo.</li><li>Very expensive for what you get in it.<br></li></ul>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,2

"Tediousity","2016-12-03T23:50:33.827Z","Nice, Small Hoth Build","<p>This is a great small set for expanding (or starting) a Hoth collection.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs:</strong></p>

<p>Han Solo is in his Hoth attire in this set and is a rather neat figure with his hood up. He comes on a semi-posable&nbsp;Tauntaun.&nbsp;There&#39;s not much else to say about him.</p>

<p>The Snowtroopers are rather detailed and one has a cannon while the other wields a blaster rifle. Both are simple but pleasant figures.</p>

<p>The Hoth Rebel Troopers are also simple yet pleasant, each having a backpack and extremely large goggles.</p>

<p><strong>Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build is rather simplistic and goes quite fast, as one would expect. The turret is attached to the trench in a very fragile way and comes off quite easily. Apart from that, however, it&#39;s a nice little build.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>This set has a Tauntaun, which looks very nice but is not very mobile unfortunately. It also has a black cord to connect the turret to the trench. The other parts of notice are two half-cylinders that make up the tower of the turret, and a black whip piece for the cannon.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>This set is a great little build with a somewhat rare Tauntaun. It&#39;s good for troop building as it has two each of Snowtroopers and Rebels. If you buy several, you can easily link them together to make a large diorama.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The turret fits a minifigure inside the bottom, which is nice so one can appear to have one inside it, or you can lift up the top cover to sit a minifigure at the top. Unfortunately, you cannot completely close the cover while the minifig&nbsp;is inside; though you can get them to be scanning the horizon.</p>

<p>There is a neat feature in which you stand the Rebels on a small table, then press down upon it to launch them into the air. This is quite simple but works exceedingly well.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a great small Hoth set, good for army-building. play, or display.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-12-30T07:00:10.04Z","Cool little Hoth battle pack","<p>It may be a little too big to call it a battle pack, but that is essentially what it is. It isn&rsquo;t enough to recreate Hoth&nbsp;on it&rsquo;s own, but it sure does fill in the missing parts of other Hoth&nbsp;sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>First of all, you get Han on a tauntaun. Why? It seems absurdly out of place with the rest of this set, but if you also own the 8089 Wampa&nbsp;Cave, then it makes perfect sense to add it to that set, and move the snowspeeder over to this set. But regardless, are you really gonna complain about getting Han on a tauntaun? I didn&rsquo;t think so!</p>

<p>You also get 2 snow troopers and 2 rebels, it is for this reason I call it a battle pack. The rebels come with blasters as does one of the snow troopers, the other snow trooper has a cannon.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Base</b></p>

<p>The base is fairly simple, a bunker and a turret, but it definitely gives you enough of a base to play with if you aren&rsquo;t looking to spend a fortune. It also has several fun play features. The best is the ground where the rebels stand, it isn&rsquo;t stable, and when you push it down the rebels go flying just like you would expect if they are hit by the cannon. This feature works incredibly well. You can also open the turret and hide a rebel inside, although I don&rsquo;t understand why. And finally the turret features firing cannons, however I can&rsquo;t get the missiles to do anything other than simply fall out. This would have been really fun if it worked better.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Build&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Nothing too special here, a little bit of technic, but don&rsquo;t expect to learn anything new. I actually like the look of the interior of the turret cannon, and was wondering why it appears to get hidden, turns out it is the mechanism for firing the missiles. It gets covered up completely, which to me is a bit of a disappointment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Parts&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Wow! This may be where a lot of the sets value is. Cylinders for the turret as well as several other interesting parts that make up the top. A flexible tube, a whip like thing, some large L shaped plates,&nbsp;and of course the tauntaun. Plus a bunch of larger bricks, this set doesn&rsquo;t inflate the brick count with small bricks too much.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>As a stand-alone set it isn&rsquo;t bad, but given that Hoth&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t mesh well with other locals, you probably won&rsquo;t be mixing non-Hoth&nbsp;Star Wars sets with this one too much. However, if you own other Hoth&nbsp;sets then that is when this set really becomes valuable. I would argue that if you had this set along with 8089 Wampa&nbsp;Cave as well as an AT-AT, you would have a very complete Hoth scene that includes all the major players and enough minor ones to create a good looking battle. I highly recommend this set if you can get your hands on one.&nbsp;</p>

"RaiderOfTheLostBrick","2020-01-14T21:02:56.917Z","âEcho Base, We have (not) spotted Imperial Walkersâ","<p>Along with Ewok Attack and The Battle of Naboo&nbsp;(both 2011), Echo Base was among my first Lego Star Wars sets which wasn&rsquo;t a Battle Pack. Back in the day this was one of my favourites, but does it stand the test of time?</p>

<p>The Good:</p>

<p>The main reason Echo Base is remembered is because it contained the first Lego Tauntaun. I still think that this is the best part of the set.</p>

<p>Seeing five minifigures in a $30 AUD Star Wars set is shocking. Han is excellent, but this was also an easy way to get a few Snowtroopers and Hoth Rebels back in the day.</p>

<p>The Mixed:</p>

<p>While the set has some play features included, not all of them work well. The turrent&rsquo;s missiles basically just drop when pushed. Meanwhile the trench&rsquo;s exploding feature will not fire the minifigure very far on the tile (Like the Instructions say). It works much better when standing on the studs.</p>

<p>The inclusion of Han is odd. While he has been featured in similar Hoth sets to this, he was working on th Millennium Falcon during the actual battle. A Hoth officer or Rebel pilot might be a more accurate choice. Also, why is it called Echo Base if it just has a trench, turrent and Tauntaun?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build&nbsp;is pretty basic, but I can forgive it for being from 2009.</p>

<p>The Bad:</p>

<p>Nothing to see here.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>While it does sound like I have really criticised Echo Base, It&rsquo;s really just an okay set. The Minifigures and Tauntaun are really the only things I find to be really worth getting.&nbsp;Everything else like the faulty play features and basic build are really just okay. Overall I would give this set 3/5, nothing special.</p>

"Lord_Master_Macdonald","2023-01-09T22:29:32.233Z","A great little display piece with an amazing minifigure selection.","<p>To start with; it&#39;s a relatively cheap set to purchase if you want to start collecting Hoth or 10th anniversary models. Whilst the design may seem simplistic at first, the overall completed look is very well shaped.</p>

<p>Minifigures: The perfect choice including a classic Han Solo in his blue hoth attire, An awesome Taunton, two classic happy rebels and two 2004 Snow Troopers.</p>

<p>The Trench: It provides the look and functionality of a Hoth trench complete with exploding play feature.</p>

<p>The turret: The&nbsp;turret can have its position switched easily. Rebels can either sit upon the turret top and fire Flick Fire Missiles from there&nbsp;or seek refuge insight a secret compartment.</p>

<p>Weapons: One Snowtrooper comes without a blaster for they have&nbsp;a E-Web Plaster instead. Otherwise, every other minifig has a standard 2007 blaster inculding&nbsp;one longer rifle.</p>

<p>NO STICKERS!</p>
