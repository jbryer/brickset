lowish cost, a quick build and it's the falcon! Not the best kit but iconic and small enough not to take up your precious display space.

Pros:
some storage in a kind of front compartment ramp
quick and easy build
fairly sturdy and quite heavy
good design and use of bricks
quite a few spare bricks



Cons:
Just a bit too small, a little bigger would have had a better rough scale towards minifigs and would have been a decent diorama, but I guess Lego want you to buy the big ass falcon.
no minifigs, something exclusive would have been nice even if not at scale.
no side ramp

The major details are there. You can't tell much from the box art but when you finally built it, it looks superb. However, the cockpit to me is still a bit too big it terms of its width.

Stands on its own with its landing gears but when you want to fly it around, looks awkward unless u pull it out.

The built is fast and nothing exciting. 

Grab it if you are a Star Wars fan like me. I simply love the size for its convenience on the desktop without hindrance to my working space.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Heishi","2009-08-03T07:24:43.06Z","Lego needs to made more midi-scale sets","I picked on up at the Lego store in Potomac Mills, Va / USA.
I enjoyed building this set.  I agree with Ant in South Africa as far as the pros and cons.

One thing I don't understand with Lego is the use of colors for some of the internal bricks.  There are blue and yellow pieces on the inside of the lit that you can see (when looking at it up close) that i am going to replace with light and dark gray pieces.

all in all. good set. fun to build.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Ant","2009-07-17T05:58:49.513Z","Something new and exciting","Just picked this set up as a post exam result gift for myself. It was an impulse buy, not a set I had been waiting for, but I realize it was well worth it.

I disagree with those who say the build is not exciting or that the set is too small. 
On the contrary, I found myself thinking how much more enjoyable it was to build this set than some of the other recent Star Wars sets. I felt like I was building one of my own MOCs rather than a standard issue set.
The set is not too small at all, I think that it would have been difficult to design a bigger set at this price point that matches up well with the real thing. On the price, I think the piece to price ratio is reasonable, compared to some of the other recent licensed sets (think Temple of Doom or Venator).

My favourite feature on the model is the antenna dish. You can't see it clearly from the picture on the box, but TLC has managed to perfectly recreate the triangular structure that the actual dish sits on.

Pro's:
- Fun build
- Reasonable price
- Something different (I find the smaller Star Wars sets have become boring)
- Detailed model

Con's
- I've accepted stickers, but cockpit sticker was 3 separate stickers which isnt
  necessary.
- section behind the cockpit is a bit blocky

"ArmchairEconomist","2009-09-23T03:36:34.403Z","Had fun building this with my 6yo!","I must give credit where it is due... because this set is 70% built by my 6 yo daughter. I just sat down and pass her the parts and she's the one who actually put them together (with my guidance of cos lah). Some parts are a little small, so she still doesn't have the kind of dexterity nor strength needed to fit and push some parts together. 

Time taken to build this was slightly over an hour (more like 1.5 hours). But must give a big discount since we are talking about a 6yo here. 

Build was quite straight-forward. Nothing special. No minifig. Low play-ability. Quite small. If I didn't build it with my gal, I'd probably be bored building it. Which is the result why I'll give it only a 6.5. 

But on the plus side...it's surprisingly quite detailed. And I'm glad they actually took some trouble to get a bit detail internally, they could have taken the short way out and fill it up with boring grey bricks. 

So.. is it a must-have? YES!! Everything aside... Simply because it the most iconic SW ship!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Monty","2010-01-03T18:15:17.2Z","Swooshable Falcon","This set seems to be available exclusively through Tesco stores in the UK otherwise it is SAH or a Lego Store.  I resisted for a while, but cracked on a recent trip to Tesco.

I enjoyed the build, but for the very first time for me in hundreds of sets I had a piece missing – luckily my spares box came to the rescue - and had others left over that I did not need – I would have preferred just the correct parts.

I agree there are some odd colours on the inside, but this does not matter too much except where they show through. So far I have not modified this set, but if I do it will probably be to these odd colours.

Stickers are used for the cockpit and elsewhere, but they are of the clear plastic variety which seem to have very strong glue compared to the paper ones so I guess time will tell – would still prefer  printed – like some other bricks in the set for grilles.

I like the overall appearance and with its solid design it is certainly much more swooshable than the larger 4504 which I loved and more accurate than the previous mini scale 4488 offering.

I feel it was still a little over priced for what you get, but that seems to be the norm now with the branded sets be it Star Wars or Lamborghini – I guess you pay for the name.

Due to missing part and odd internal colours as well as slight overpricing I think a 4 is about right,

"vynsane","2010-01-19T14:55:40.467Z","Beautiful, affordable, well-detailed model of a total classic","Long, LONG ago, I wrote a letter to LEGO Group suggesting that they make sets based on the movie Ghostbusters (it woud've been so awesome). In their response, they articulated how they pride themselves on developing non-licensed properties but would take in under consideration. My how times have changed. My question now is: Where is my royalty check for giving them the idea to venture into licensed properties? ;)

I received this item from my wife for Christmas after seeing it in the store and falling in love. I had been intrigued by the Star Wars and Indiana Jones sets, but felt it would be too much to get into. This set was too good to pass up - a moderately-sized model of an awesome spaceship for a reasonable price that would be a good display item. Of course, since receiving this item I've now either received or bought a couple of Indiana Jones and Space Police 3 sets, but that's neither here nor there.

The build on this was a lot of fun - whether or not that had more to do with actual construction, or the fact that it was the first LEGO set I constructed in a good 20 years and that my 3y/o daughter had just as much fun helping me than it did, I can't really tell. It made for a rather special Christmas morning, all told. As noted in other reviews, the area behind the cockpit is a bit clunky, but that's the biggest gripe I can come up with.

The end result, however, is more like a rather intricately detailed scale model than a lego set, probably due to the non-standardized (meaning not mini-fig compatible) size. This is a benefit and a drawback - older fans of Star Wars who are not necessarily into LEGO might pick it up as a collectible, and LEGO artists might get it for vignettes or photo MOCs, as a background piece to facilitate forced-perspective. For MOCers, the piece has a large variety of light gray parts, so that's another faction of LEGO entusiasts that will take interest in this set. On the other hand, the size makes it easily swooshable even for little hands (especially in comparison to the larger versions) so playability IS high in that regard, though it suffers due to the scale issues. It might work in-scale with some of the mini starfighter sets like the X-Wing and others. I don't know off-hand, as I don't own any of those.

It would have been nice to include a display stand for it, but i understand the need to keep it as affordable as possible and utilize all the pieces included solely for construction of the ship itself. It could be constructed relatively easily for an experienced builder, and I'm going to take a stab at it myself.

As the inaugural edition of a series that will apparently continue, it's interesting to see where this type of set fits within the greater scheme of the LEGO product line. Whether it is more appealing to MOCers, Star Wars fans, or kids for playability remains to be seen. It may just continue to straddle the fence of all those categories that I've arbitrarily created, though future additions to this fledgling series may show a clearer path.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"blaksamu12","2010-08-11T21:43:51.927Z","Awesome but has a few flaws","<p>The Midi-Scale Millenium Falcon is an excellent set.&nbsp; It has immense detail and looks great.&nbsp; However, the ship lacks playibility and value for money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>building experience</strong> it very good.&nbsp; I had a great time building the set.&nbsp; The interior was really cool and not to hard.&nbsp; It was a very interesting build because both sides of the set were different so the was no repetition like in the new Midi-Scale Star Destroyer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability</strong> for this set set is definately lacking.&nbsp; The only thing you can do really is fly it around and move a few pieces.&nbsp; There isnt any true features, but when a buy an overall really small set, then you shouldn't really expect much for playibility.&nbsp; The&nbsp;ship is better for&nbsp;display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Value&nbsp;for Money </strong>isn't great but its not horrible.&nbsp; The set is $40, which is a lot for a set that you can hold strongly with one hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,&nbsp;there is 356 pieces, so its only about $5 over-priced.&nbsp; It still hard to believe its $40 for how small the set is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is wonderful <strong>Overall,</strong> and is must-have to me.&nbsp; The price is kind of high and there minimal playability, but its fun to build and looks great.&nbsp; It set is perfect for display, and comes with some cool Millenium Falcon facts.&nbsp; I would get the set if you like star was and if you want pieces, but its not for people who like sets with lots of figures and playability.&nbsp; I highly recommend it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,3

"mustakotka","2014-02-18T20:15:36.92Z","Detailed and exterior oriented","<p>Initially I bought this model because the scale matches quite well with UCS Rebel Blockade Runner (10019). Since it&#39;s an exterior-only ship the end result is really nice with lots of detail.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Loved building this! Mine was missing a few pieces since it was a used model but the overall building experience was very satisfying. &nbsp;Nothing too fancy, but there are some interesting things going on with the engine, the cockpit and some of the greebels.</p>

<p>The stickers. Since mine was a used model, they were attached already. By a blind thumbless monkey. So a very sharp knife it was... Happy with the end result, though. Plus these stickers seem to be some kind of plastic instead of paper-like substance so they don&#39;t rot that easily. However, if you do break a sticker, beware that they contain transparent regions and printing off a new one isn&#39;t an easy job. I suggest replacing transparent areas with the colour of the underlying piece.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The design is great quality, looks authentic. Playability is an option because the ship is not immensely heavy and is very sturdy by its nature. Only parts that keep falling off are the quad turbolasers&nbsp;and the radar dish, but hey, even Lando&nbsp;Calrissian&nbsp;swooped away the radar dish.</p>

<p>No stand, which is sad. Building a stand for this turned out to be quite a task because the centre of gravity is situated right where the dishes are and to get the end result to look good you must have some insightful vision about it.</p>

<p>Otherwise the model is crowded with detail and well worth the money. There&#39;s also a lot of options for modification. The inside of the ship is relatively empty or the little structures there are can be rebuilt easily. The dimensions are so good that I didn&#39;t need the feel to touch them but I opted to run some blue&nbsp;electro luminescent wire through the engine tube and hide the electronics inside the ship. Now my&nbsp;Millenium Falcon has a glowing engine.</p>

<p>A great set! You can find these easily on ebay and amazon for a good price. Prices haven&#39;t inflated much from original retail prices, which is good. Replacements are fairly well available both bricklink and surprisingly Lego&#39;s own pick a brick service.&nbsp;</p>
