"parchioso","2009-06-02T22:42:14.14Z","Solid Small Shuttle with 2 new valuable minifigs","8036 Separatist Shuttle has been mentioned extensively along with other Lego Starwars 2009 Summer sets, these are all interesting new additions but 8036 offers 2 new minifigs that caught a lot of attentions. To be honest I am not a minifigs freak (or geek), so even if I buy a set for the minifigs, I would complain loudly if the vehicle stinks.

The shuttle is quite small, but a shuttle is a shuttle, actually I can feel how small it is when I was pulling out the bags from the box, but it is ok, coz this shuttle IMHO has been designed well, I am not sure how all the other much experienced builders would say, I am quite impressed by the sleak design.

The knob controlled doors is quite impressive over the common hinged doors, it is not easy to design a container space inside such a small vehicle. Besides, the building process is very smooth, the rear tail wing is very solid and nicely layered, and unlike many of the Star Wars vehicles, the shuttle is extremely solid! It is so solidly designed that it can be solidly separated and packed in chunks inside the original box, which if attempted on other fat vehicles, would instantly result in a vehicle break down.

There isn't any special parts in this set, but I don't think anyone would buy this set for reusing the parts really, the minifigs are what people mainly look for in this set I think, and the 2 minfigs are truly valuable, you get Nute Gunray and Senator Farr for the first time,  and the 2 minifigs are quite good looking (in minifigs standards, which focus on color and pattern instead of being handsome), despite being the villains.

Overall this is must get set for Star War fans, ""must get"" are truly overused nowadays but I do mean must-get because it does not cost unreasonably if you buy it at regular price, you get 2 rare minifigs in addition to a nice shuttle.

Usually small sets like this can't do much and have a cheap build. This lego, however, has a good, easy, sturdy build. The rear of the ship is taken up by a gear mechansim that opens sliding doors in the back where the astounding Nute Gunray minifigure can be stashed. The Rodian minifigure really has nothing to do with the ship, but is a good extra item. The front hatch is occupied by a droid and is pretty much empty otherwise, but hey, how much can you fit in one small set? The price is pretty reasonable and the minifigs quite impressive. The ship isn't a disappointment either, as I had originally figured it would be. Thank goodness I was proved wrong.

 Minifigs
 Probably one of the most interesting things in this set, Occonda Farr and Nute Gunray are only available in this set, and the pilot droid is extremely hard to come by. Nute Gunrays helmet is larger than expected, and his face is very detailed. Occonda Farr has a new leg color, and new torso print. His head is shaped just like Greedos, but has a different color. The battle droids are nothing special, but great for army building.

 Shuttle
Even though it is a tad bit small, it still packs a big punch. The doors work great, but a small gap is left when fully closed. In the pilots chamber , you can fit an extra battle droid inside. It has very nice detail, and is surprisingly roomy inside when finished. The landing feet dont help it stay up, since the belly of th sip reaches the ground, but they are nice for decoration. It is also the sturdiest non-bionicle I have.

"Leggodt94","2009-07-31T23:47:00.7Z","""Time to abandon ship."" - General Grievous","This set, I think, is good. It's definitely a good buy considering the price per peice thing at LEGO has been way off for most clone wars sets. You basically get the shuttle which, for me, became a coveted, potential lego set ever since I first saw it in revenge of the sith. You also get ridiculously awsome minifigs like the most anticipated nute gunray, anaconda farr, a blue pilot droid, and two battle droids. The model though had a some ups and downs. Upward-wise, the doors open at the twist of a gear, landing gears fold up and down again, and the cockpit is very roomy. Downward-wise, the landing gears only seem to be for detail use considering that they do abosutely nothing because the base of the ship holds it up; nute gunray's chair platform is very difficult to take out, and the doors don't close completely. Overall, it's a decent set, but there is definitley room for improvements so I can only give this set a 4/5.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:
-Two exclusive minifigures. Onaconda Farr is especially nice if you don't have the rare Greedo minifigure.
-Reasonable price, especially considering it has two great exclusive figs.
-The shuttle is fairly accurate.
-The opening doors are awesome.
-It is easily moddable. I gave it an interior with no huge wall separating the cockpit form the passenger area in the back. It's still pretty sturdy, and the doors still work!

Cons:
-I would have much preferred a piloted version to a droid version. I think the cockpit form the Magnaguard starfighter would have been perfect for this.
-It would have been cool if it was armed, like the one Anakin and Obi-wan stole in the Clone Wars episode Dooku Captured.

"captain_radda_radda","2009-08-16T00:53:18.577Z","A late start to wave 3(for me anyway!)","As stated, this is my first of the Star Wars Clone Wars wave 3 line. I was too busy buying transformers (I do have other hobbies). The set itself is fantastic and very well built. It is a lot taller than I thought. The color scheme is surprisingly vibrant. For once the grey is too bright and makes the set less TV accurate. The dark blue does work well though. One common complaint I have heard is that the cockpit has no room for anything but the battle pilot. While this is true, certain pieces can be moved to fit a standard minifigure. I really dont understand the antena on the cockpit door but it isnt a complaint. The door opening feature works a lot better than I thought. The area where the Viceroy sits is cramped, but it keeps the figure from sliding around. 

The figs are wonderful. Nute Gunray is obviously the star of the set. His hat is entirely new and covers about half of the back of his head. His outfit is a little boring, but otherwise, very TV accurate. Gunrays head is supposed to be faded green (like most Nemodians) but the grey works okay. They could have just used the green dementor head instead. Senator Farr fits into the story (as seen in episode 8 Bombad Jedi) but is kind of useless and random. I just stuck him in my attack shuttle. Same old droids, but its okay because we can  always use more. The droids came with 2 straight arms so I took 2 of my old ""megaphone"" blaster droids and simply converted them. 

Pros: 
Okay price 
Figures
Everything can be used with with regurlar Star Wars sets
Good features
The landing gear works
Gunray isnt too ""Clone Warsy"" 
Another Rodian 

Cons:
The shade of grey is too bright 
Lets face it: Senator Farr is boring
Not long enough

"kibble123456789","2009-11-04T19:39:37.607Z","Not bad not bad whatsoever.","     So when I got it I was pretty lucky because it was the last one at the lego store.  But anyway on to the review.

     First of all the figures.  Nute Gunray is exclusive so obviously he's pretty cool.  If you want a droid commander this is probably the cheapest set with some one to command your droid army!  Ocanda Farr is exclusive as well the only con is that he has a very short head making him very short compared to Nute gunray with his tall hat.  The droids are average but a nice addition because first of all you need some one to drive it.  And second you have 2 droids to escort Gunray.  

     Now on to the ship allot bigger then i expected.  Pros are the landing gear, the color scheme,  it has nice landing gear, a passenger seat and pilot seat, and the technic-like opening back door.  The only con is the stick-like piece falls off allot.

so there you have it.  Definitely worth it for the many mini figs, the color scheme, the size, 2 seats, and the technic-like doors

"DarthSteve","2009-11-18T21:37:10.983Z","A Very Good Little Ship","Let me just start by saying that I think a lot of people would probably write this set off from how it looks on the box. I had my doubts at first, but after I finished the build I was quite happy with the result. I could see this set being a little underrated due to its size (it is smaller than I expected for the price) but does come with some very unique minifigs; notably the Viceroy Nute Gunray from Episodes I - III. He's a great minifig to have if you're big into the Trade Federation's Droid Armies like I am. After all, you need someone to command those droids, don't you? Of course you do! (Note to the LEGO Makers: you should release the Droid Control Ship from Episode I!)

In Canada, this Separatist Shuttle costs around $50.00 and for the price alone, I would almost say it's not worth it. The loading bay sliding doors rattle very slightly from time to time but it's so minor I won't even count that as a flaw here. Simply put, the ship's mechanics are brilliantly designed. All in all, I'm very happy I bought this set.

A nice addition to your star fleet, if your wallet can handle it.

"Lint","2010-01-15T19:35:36.31Z","Dissatisfying","I'll start of by declaring that I am not a Star Wars fanatic, but i'm not a hater to the franchise either. This review will be as neutral as it gets. The set, although aesthetically pleasing suffers from more than a few design flaws and also a complete ripoff, even at clearance price. I dislike that the prices of sets appear to be marked up just because they have some exclusive minifigs.

PROS
-It's enjoyable to build and the majority of the shuttle is stable.
-Looks great
-You get some exclusive minifigs (Gunray, Farr and the pilot droid) and some battle droids too!
-You actually get a good variety of bricks, panels, translucents, mechanical parts for your collection.
-The double sliding door mechanism is really neat.

CONS
-Weak design/build (the giant fin tends to fall off during play, the pilot hatch tends to snap loose when opening, the antenna tends to fall off)
-The shuttle only fits one minifig in the front and one in the back. I feel that the front could have fit two if they were a bit more thoughtful about the design.
-Nute Gunray and Onaconda Farr don't look THAT great and come with no accessories.
-For a set of this size it was weak on spare bits. Would have loved a spare blaster :P
-Price Price Price. At full RRP i could have bought 3 battlepacks. At clearance price I could have bought 2. Either way I would have been more satisfied with those purchases than this one.

"ShatteredGnome","2010-04-13T22:18:06.28Z","Finally Got It!","<p>I've been waiting to get this since&nbsp;it came first came out and now that I have it, i'm very pleased.&nbsp;I waited to get&nbsp;it, and was able to snag one off Amazon for about $22.50 with free shipping, so that was a plus too. After its built, it isn't extremely big, but it really has that menacing, insectoid feel of a Neimodian shuttle, and with a few modifications I think I&nbsp;can make it better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, the build was fun and involved not only a large selection of familiar parts, but good ones at that. The set is mostly grey with some color here and there, mostly from a few brown, blue and black bricks, but also the stickers(which i'm not opposed to, by the way). Even though I would have loved the colors to have been mostly grey and blue&nbsp;for acuracy, the way it looks on the outside is great. My only peeve is the one royal blue brick they snuck in the inside. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After its built, the model is a little small but the fin gives it a large size. The cockpit and body having been connected, it isn't tiny and with one piece inside the cockpit you can make the ever so slight wiggling of the front stop, if you're worried about that. After a few tweaks to the landing gear, it really can 'stand up' without sitting on the body, but its a bit wobbly. It really is fantastic, and I love the&nbsp;sliding back doors. The only thing is that there's supposed to be a landing ramp that&nbsp;comes down from the back over the doors, so the people can exit (also, the interior back really only fits 1 person). So really, lego could have&nbsp;made the set a little bigger to improve on its accuracy, but I think that after a few tweaks&nbsp;to the structure, it will be up to snuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, the figs are great, Nute Gunray makes another much needed Separatist leader and you can decide Onaconda Farr's allegiance. Then you get a pilot droid(my first), and two more battle droids for&nbsp;your army. (there's also two extra&nbsp;'blaster' arms to mod older battle droids)</p>

You're 6 yr. old on up (with a little help) should have no trouble putting this together. It has a nice design (almost 'insectoid' in appearance) and a neat rear opening sliding door. 

Pro's-Ship design, opening front cockpit with a blue bodied Battle Droid pilot, retractable front and rear landing gear, a clever technic system that opens a sliding rear door to reveal a small chamber which holds a Nute Gunray mini figure which can be slide out. Also comes with 2 regular Battle Droids and an Onaconda Farr mini-figure(nice head sculpt of Greedo). Also of note is that I like how Lego designed the rear tail fin to be hollow so as the attenae on the front opening cockpit won't interfere with opening and closing.

<p>Any&nbsp;how the&nbsp;ship is good but the inside is a little small.&nbsp;Nute Gunray's seat is&nbsp;pathetic and his room is kind of bad:( The cockpit is small and the window from the movie is not there.&nbsp;But the gear door function is great:) </p>
<p>Now for the mini figs. Onaconda Farr is very nice&nbsp;and his head is great. Nute Gunray is good to but his skin is gray and his head dress is not very detailed. The pilot droid is cool and battle droids are good to have. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over all it is a good set. And a nice addition to a Star Wars collection</p>

"LegoHov23","2013-01-03T12:24:22.943Z","A Very Nice Buy","<p>Personally I prefer Republic sets but when I saw this set I was intrigued, particularly when I saw the figures - Gunray, Farr and three droids. I picked up a few weeks later and it proved to be wortth it as it was a nice purchase.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Minifigures: Gunray and Farr are both unique to this set and I amd quite a fan of the rare pilot droid</li><li>Two battle droids - can't complain</li><li>Simple but enjoyable build</li><li>Compact - it's not an ugly ship but it won't break too easily</li><li>Easy to hold</li><li>Landing gear is a welcome feature</li><li>Sliding doors in the backa nice little touch</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>While the main body of the ship won't break, the tail tends to come off when dropped</li><li>Not the greatest of cockpits; nothing but a few bricks with some space for the pilot</li></ul>
<p>One of the best things about this set is that it's not particularly expensive so it makes a nice little present, especially due to the rare minifgures. Plus... Always good to get another couple of regular old battle droids to bulk up your army. Overall, a solid set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
