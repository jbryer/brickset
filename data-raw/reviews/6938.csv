"MayTheBricksBeWithYou","2009-05-22T10:55:15.903Z","Let's put the saber in the back!","I just picked this set up in TRU Würselen (Germany) together with Battle of Endor (review pending) and I started with this set. 

When you empty the (unnumbered) bags on the table you are almost blinded with the huge amount of bright white and yellow pieces. What a brilliant colour scheme! 

The moment I saw this Y-Wing on the series I thought, LEGO could make a great model out of this, I checked the web and found out it was indeed coming. When I saw it at TRU I didn't hesitate one bit and brought it back home.

The build was fairly easy, there is no real complex stuff going on. They spliced up the build in several sections. You start with the rear and, then the whole middle and front section. Next up are the 'wings'. Then you'll add some nice detailing on the top to put it all together and then you'll start on the huge engine gondolas. 

Some nice details include the way R2D2 is put in the back on top of the torpedo-launcher switch. So when yo jiggle R2 back it will trigger the torpedo. Very nice! Added bonus is that R2 is finally 'locked' in place and won't fall out when you swoosh it around the room. And finally they made a nice trunk which fit the 'lit' lightsabers with ease, and it looks very nice with all the grey techy bits. 

Let put it down in to Pros & Cons:

The Pros
+ Brilliant colour scheme
+ Some nice parts included
+ Great torpedo launch system by using R2D2.
+ R2D2 stays on it's place.
+ Only 2 stickers, the cockpit controls are nice printed bricks!
+ A nice detailed trunk for the sabers!

The Cons
- Ashoka's turret can't rotate",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"gratefulnat","2009-06-07T17:17:45.64Z","Solid and refreshing","This was one of the 2009 CW sets that just didn't interest me at all, but luckily I had a weak moment once I saw it sitting on the store shelf. I had never liked all that yellow, but once I got building it struck me as very refreshing, the colors work really well - very vibrant.

The build is straightforward but fun. Unusual for a CW set is the limited number of technic pieces - so you get to build all the details pretty much with classic LEGO parts - good fun! The missile firing mechanism is triggered by toggeling R2-D2 and works superbly. This is one solid set, folks! Plus the cockpit canopy is a PRINT, as are the computer consoles. There are two stickers - the republic's emblem - for sticking on the engine blocks.

A couple of complaints:

1/ The engine blocks wobble (remember all those tie-fighter wings) as they're pretty heavy and are connected by three pins located in the first third of the engines, so they really tend to hang down, but was easy to modify with two extra pieces making them rock solid.

2/ The upper turret doesn't swivel, and getting the minifig in is a tight fit - you have to remove the turret and blasters to put the figure in. Plus with a hairdo like Ahsoka has... so she flies and Anakin shoots.

3/ The storage compartment for the lightsabers is neat, and big enough(finally LEGO, thanks) but 2 flat 1x6 yellow tiles should have come with the set to cover up the studs on the top rim of the compartment - minor detail, but pleasing to the eye.

Well, it was great to build, and is an absolutely solid set if one mods the wings. Very swooshable. I'd give this set a 5 out of 5, but considering we've seen these minifigs in many previous CW sets, I give it a 4 out of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

After watching the episode Shadow of malevolence i couldn't wait to see a clone wars Y-Wing, and when i got it (for my birthday-what a treat), I was blown away by this set, it really is incredible and I was thrilled to get my first lego Y-wing.

Pros: Sleek, shiny design
         Sturdy, no falling apart from this set!
         New R2-D2 minifig
         Cool purple engine pieces
         Nice rear detail

Cons: Bubble turret doesn't rotate
         No Matchstick minifigure :(
         Anakin and Ahsoka AGAIN!!


Overall, this set truly is my favourite from the Clone Wars line so far, and I highly recommend that if you can, buy this set, it really is fantastic!

"parchioso","2009-10-23T09:18:03.42Z","If you collect all Y-Wings, get it, but if you need only one...","When you ask a Lego Star Wars fan on which vehicle is the symbol of the series, I guess many would say X-Wing, I still remember years back when 6212 was so scarce in the market, many would have been willing to pay 2 times the original price to get one, but in comparison, 7658 Y-Wing Fighter has been on cold shelf and even today, some shops have to sell it as bargain item. 

The same fate hits 8037, Anakin's Y-wing Starfighter, so I ask myself, is Y-Wing ugly? Is it lacking the exposure or charisma to be a Star? Personally I think the vehicle is great, the two special big nacelles is a unique design, the many small pieces of bricks peppered over the main body reminds me of a sophisticated vessal sailing the oceans, so what's wrong with it that makes it a poor seller?

Could the answer lies in the minifigs? Comparing 7658 to 6212 in terms of minifigs is definitely a big mismatch, 8037 includes a special version of R2 but all Lego Star Wars fans must have obtained Anakin and Ashoka from other sets long ago.

After building 8037, I think this is not a very great implementation of the Y-Wing, it lacks playability, as you got only a firing missile and one of two not so interesting moving parts, and the chamber for Ahsoka is badly designed, not only it is too small, it lacks maneuverability, the sides are also too hefty, and the use of stickers in this case is very disappointing. As far as the Y-Wing itself is concerned, I think it is a great vehicle to have, but personally I like 7658 much better, though for completeness, I need to have a 8037 too.

If having one Y-Wing is good enough for you, I would suggest 7658, it is simply elegant! You may check out my blog entry for pictorial comparison of the two Y-Wings side by side:

"hobohopper","2009-08-08T15:59:36.56Z","The new Y Wing is pure WIN","First off, the set is HUGE. 17 inches long, 7 inches wide, for just $60. These days, all the Clone Wars Sets are horribly overpriced, yet i found that this is one of those sets that's still worth your money.

Ive heard people complain about Anakin and Ashoka being very common minifigures. But i think that it's not such a big deal because this y-wing is the cheapest way to get both minifigures in one set. Also, this is the cheapest set with the new recolored R2 (for now atleast)

The build is very comfortable. Technic pieces are minimum, and mostly its just regular lego bricks. Many smooth pieces are included to give the ship attractive curves and creases. However the engines are a bit repetitive. Its basically stacking cylinders together. The bubbly turret also doesnt rotate like it does in the tv show. Building the cannon underneath the vehicle was alot of fun for me because i hate no idea how pulling on R2-D2 would fire the missle. Turns out R2 is ingeniously attacked to the spring mechanism which pokes out through an opening from underneath the ship.

The finished result is impressive. The combination of smooth yellow and white pieces make this new Y-Wing shiny and glossy under light. Not only that, but the enitre ship is surprisingly sturdy. Oh and did i mention how huge this thing is?

Pros
-huge
-sturdy build
-Great color scheme, its beautiful under the light
-firing mechanism works great
-Cheapest set with the new R2
-Also the cheapest set with both Anakin and Ashoka

Cons
-common minifigures
-somewhat repetive build
-bubble turret doesnt rotate

"Niallskie","2009-10-03T07:19:33.687Z","Great sturdy built","Just recently got this set and went in to read some reviews to see how other collector things of it before I opened mine. Took me about an hour to finish this dude in and wow, it is definitely an awesome set! This piece is massive and sure enough it was sturdy, swooshability is great. The built of this set is sleak and smooth, engine is a big bulk of boost waiting to ignite. Another thing is this was constructed with less Technic parts which really does not matter to me as long as a set holds true to the design. Here are some pro's and con's to add to the review.

Pro's
- Sturdy built
- Smooth finish
- Massive set
- Swooshability is awesome
- Inovative compartment for light saber

Con's
- Anakin, R2 D2 and Ahsoka mini figures (quite common on a lot of set)

Other than that, I say this set is fantastic in it's own right. It's alright as Anakin, R2 D2 and Ahsoka are the main characters of a lot of set but would have better if they have variation on the costume to differ from other sets as it would greatly improve it's collectability. 

All in all this is a set worth collecting, I give it a 4 rating.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"captain_radda_radda","2009-12-26T23:09:39.437Z","EXCELENT!","I got this set as a Christmas present and got building right away. The build took about an hour and was probably the biggest downfall of this set. Most of the areas aroung the cockpit are simply redid and the white strips seen on the wings are redone 7 more times! This gave for a boring and repetative build. The set itself is big and I mean big. This is definately worth $60. Best of all, we get a nicely detailed R2. As you know, the turret does not rotate, but I gues thats okay. After wacthing the episode Shadow of Malevolence, I have noticed that the clone trooper Y-wings have white bodies with yellow stripes whereas Anakins has a yellow body with white stripes. I think they should make a clone version with Matchstick because this Y-Wing fits the clones, but not very well. What I like is the pink transparent discs used for thruster rings. This adds to the uniqueness of the set. 

Pros:
Price
Size
R2
colors

Cons
The build
The front guns are too long

"meyerc13","2010-12-29T11:10:31.063Z","All Star Wars fans will love this set!","<p>Last night I opened the box to build this set, and as I emptied the bags my first thought was, ""Wow!&nbsp; That is a lot of yellow and white.""&nbsp; Since this set doesn't use the numbered bags of some of the other lines like LEGO City, a good strategy is probably to sort out the large bags into their respective colors, and then make a pile of all of the various small pieces in front of you.&nbsp; Enough about that, on to the review!<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The best thing about this set is that it will appeal to nearly all Star Wars fans.&nbsp; I'm a fan of the original Trilogy, and the Y-Wing was a classic fighter used by the rebel alliance.&nbsp; My kids like the Clone Wars just as much, so they are happy because of the included minifigures.&nbsp; So there is definitely something for everyone in this set.<br></li><li>Which leads to the next great thing about this set, the minifigures.&nbsp; This set doesn't have many, but they are good ones.&nbsp; Anakin, Ahsoka Tano, and R2-D2.</li><li>The minifigures are great, but the ship itself is beautiful.&nbsp; It is very long with the engines, as it should be.&nbsp; The colors look great together.&nbsp; One nice hidden feature is a storage compartment for lightsabers.&nbsp; This is a great touch and not obvious in some of the pictures.</li><li>Another positive of this set is that it is very sturdy.&nbsp; Many of the 
LEGO Star Wars sets lack in playability because pieces fall off if you 
look at them funny, but this set seems quite solid so far.</li><li>One thing many will love is that this model uses only two stickers!&nbsp; Pieces that you would expect to have as stickers aren't, like the control panels and the wonderful cockpit piece.&nbsp; All of the striping is bricks, the only stickers are for the Republic emblem, so they aren't even essential.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>For a mid-range set, it is lacking in minifigure quantity.&nbsp; It would have been nice if LEGO had included a couple of Rebel Pilots to appease original trilogy fans, but that wouldn't happen because LEGO does not mix eras in that fashion.<br></li><li>For the most part, the build experience is fun, but the number of white yellow pieces makes it a challenge.&nbsp; The worst part is building the white stripes that run down the engines.&nbsp; You must repeat this step four times for each engine.&nbsp; I built them in parallel, but it still tested my patience.&nbsp; Luckily this step comes near the end with the finish in sight.</li><li>Another con is the turret does not rotate.&nbsp; Even my five year old son's first question was, ""does this turn?""&nbsp; I think the reason is that it would be difficult to build a rotating turret that would hold Ahsoka, but it still detracts a bit from this set.<br></li></ul><p>Overall this is a wonderful set, and when I play LEGO Star Wars with my son I'm sure we'll be fighting over who gets to fly the Y-Wing.&nbsp; It is a great set to bridge two generations of Star Wars fans, those who remember this from Return of the Jedi and those who know it more from the Clone Wars era.&nbsp; I'd highly recommend picking up this set if you can still find it, because you'll regret it if you don't.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

The build: Im afraid this build is very repetitive and quite boring. for the white strips around the engines you have to build 8 altogether which gets very boring. But you can tell it is starting to take shape quite early into the build. But when you finish it is well worth it.

The features: This Ship has some great features and has no flick missiles (Woohoo!) instead it has a great big missile and when you pull R2 back it fires and can go amazingly far. there is also a compartment to store both Anakins and Ahsokas lightsabers (Not just the hilt, the whole lightsaber).

"EtudeTheBadger","2010-03-25T16:38:41.75Z","Anakin's New Motor","<p>Well, this is good. A tie to the unbeatable Original Trilogy set firmly in the Clone Wars milieu; possibly an attempt to draw in older fans.<br />
And it works!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Vaderphile (if you can come up with a better name for an Original Trilogy fanatic, your suggestions are more than welcome), it's great to see something like this in a part of the universe I find so far removed from the Imperial Era. You've got the prequel-ish, organiform droid ships, the Old-Republic style, crenellated and rounded clone fighters- and there we have it, the good old Koensayr BTL Y-wing of the Rebel Alliance (or soon to be of the Rebel Alliance; sometimes it's hard to tell which set of films is meant to be earlier, given the visual style)!</p>
<p>The model itself is superb; a mix of old-style blocky LEGO bricks with some of the more contemporary parts we see so often in sets now. The build itself is very pleasurable, and it's a somewhat large vehicle to construct. The Y-wing comes with a shiny-domed Artoo and HoloNet News's Jedi Pairing of the Hour, Anakin and Ahsoka. The figures fit into the ship perfectly, and add to the colour of the model.</p>
<p>However, that's one of the cons. Although Anakin can fit into the cockpit, a clone trooper, the Republic's stock pilot, cannot. The same goes for 'Ahsoka's Turret' (which sadly does not traverse). I find it somewhat confusing; few Jedi fly these things, they're a clone-piloted rig. A bit of a fudge, and the biggest problem here.</p>
<p>However, it's also possibly the only problem. The scale of the ship, as aforementioned, is superb, and the feel is excellent. It's also easy to hold and fly. Skyguy and Snips have a heck of a ride.</p>

<p>I got this set for my birthday in 2010. I have always wanted and admired it. I love it. Great Jedi set. Other than Ahsoka's cockpit (explained below) the only cons are that the wing tubes are a little loose and I can't remember the other one right now. Oh well.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<ul>
<li>Anakin Skywalker- late Clone Wars Anakin Skywalker minifigure coming out (in Dathomir Speeder), but I think that this one is better. The hair piece is very useful for making custom minifigures. In the instructions, the lightsaber is built with the handle upside down. 
<li>Ahsoka Tano- one of the rare few minifigures whose head/alien hair piece isn't rubber. It's solid plastic like normal Lego. Love the light gray with red-brown top leg piece. Cool lightsaber. In the instructions, the lightsaber is built with the handle upside down. 
<li>R2-D2- this Artoo is called the Clone Wars version by Brickset. I am not sure if&nbsp;it is only available here now, but this is where it made its debut. The difference is the dark blue gray head, and printing of course.</li></ul>
<h4>Cockpits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Anakin's opens nicely, although if you are rough or not careful enough you can take off the yellow 2X4 brick it's attached to. Printed. 
<li>Ahsoka's does not open. You have to take off the top (from the yellow piece up), put here in, put the top back on, take off the dome, push Ahsoka down all the way, and put the dome back on. 
<li>R2-D2 is sideways in his astromech socket.&nbsp;He is connected by his axle hole in the bottom of his middle element, which is part of the missle funtion. The missle shoots out from under the front, fired by pushing Artooie back (although it may be forward, I'm not quite sure).</li></ul>
<h4>Lightsaber</h4>
<p>The lightsabers are made with the handles upside down in the instructions (as said above). They have a special secret compartment behind R2-D2. Facing the front of the ship, Anakin's is on the left, Ahsoka's on the right.</p>
<h4>The actual ship</h4>
<p>The ship has the missile function, as well as two blasters in the front. The 'wings' are sturdy, as is the whole ship, really. The hyperdrive engines at the back of the wing tubes are translucent pink.</p>

"Chills","2012-08-31T10:48:29.573Z","Really cool version of an iconic Star Wars ship","<p>So I've never seen an episode of Clone Wars, and I had to check out Wookiepedia to see what this set was all about (I received it as a gift from my Father-in-Law... great guy). It turns out the designer of the BTL-B Y-Wing (this set) went off the assumption that the Y-Wing we see in the movies is a stripped down version of an existing ship. Kinda like the Alliance techs got a hold of a sports car and removed everything to make it a racer. So the designers made a full-faired version of a Y-Wing, and here it is as a great set.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: Going off the premise I talked about above I have to say the designers of this set did a great job. This ship looks like a solid, original version of the Y-Wing. It has a very Star Wars feel, and accurate to the pics I've seen of it online.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The ship is very solid. If you compare it to the first LEGO Y-Wing in set 7150 you'll notice a difference. That ship was flimsy. This one is designed and built to be a heavy fighter-bomber, and you can feel it. The used of thick bricks and multiple stacks of plates give the set strength.</li><li>Pro 3: The build was a lot of fun. It wasn't quick, it took a while which is a good thing. There's a lot of detail to this ship and it takes time to put it together. The parts are very cool, too. I like the use of yellow and white, and the clear bubble is new for me.<br></li><li>Pro 4: Playability, there's a good amount here. A firing missile, rear-facing cannons, and a spot for the light sabers. Nice. I also like how you use R2 to trigger the missile. <br></li><li>Pro 5: 3 minifigures, Anakin and Ahoska are CW versions. Not my cup of tea, but still nice additions to my collection. And another R2.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Landing gear. There isn't any and I would like some. There's one hinge piece on the back of the fuselage, but I'm not sure what its for.</li><li>Con 2: Building the engines was a bit monotonous, but if you build them assembly-line style it's not bad at all.<br></li></ul>
<p>This is a really cool set, and while I'm not a fan of CW I dig the Y-Wing. Its solid, good playability, a fun build, and you get cool pieces in cool colors. After building a few TIE sets it was nice to build a set from the other side, and one that isn't so flimsy. Even if you aren't a Clone Wars fan this is a cool set to have in&nbsp; your collection.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,3

"bricksaber","2018-02-05T22:10:28.76Z","Happy 10th Anniversary Clone Wars! Happy 60th Anniversary Lego!","<p>This is my second review to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, the show I am&nbsp;proud to be a part of. As hinted&nbsp;in my <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/52709"">first</a><a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/52709""> review</a>,&nbsp;this is my favorite Clone Wars set and I will be doing this review a little differently by focusing on how the Y-Wing was made&nbsp;for the show.</p>

<h2>The Set</h2>

<p>This is my favorite set in terms of both subject matter and build. Anakin&#39;s Y-Wing was extremely faithful to the source material, it had many great parts like the 4x4 domes in white and clear, it was a solid and interesting build, and it was fun to play with and swoosh around. Its only drawbacks being the wrong shaped cockpit (something Lego has yet to do correctly on any system version of the Y-Wing) and the TERRIBLE CW minifigs&nbsp;with their warped faces.</p>

<h2>The Ship</h2>

<p>In case there was any doubt, most of the Clone Wars crew where big fans of Star Wars especially our fearless leader Dave Filoni. So when a legacy item from the original trilogy was added to any episode it created quite the buzz among the crew. For myself, I&nbsp;was so excited&nbsp;I decided to make a personal documentary about the Y-Wing&#39;s creation and that&#39;s where most of these stills come from.</p>

<p>At the time, I was manager of the design department and it was my job to assign work to the artists and for the Y-Wing&nbsp;Dave wanted Russell Chong to do&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><img alt=""Russell Chong's desk"" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4614/40073163652_95cd8153dd_z.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></p>

<p>Russell is an awesome, old school draftsman (above is his desk). He jumped at the chance to give a new spin to a classic vehicle.</p>

<p><img alt=""Russell with episodic director, Brian Kalin-O'Connell"" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4770/40073167032_3f50d2f316_z.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></p>

<p>Because of it being an&nbsp;animated show, everything on the Clone Wars had to be designed. There was no &#39;found object&#39; or &#39;kit bashing&#39; available to us. So everything from a bottle in the background to the redesign of a spaceship&nbsp;goes through a long process of review. Above, Russell chats with episodic director Brian Kalin-O&#39;Connell&nbsp;on&nbsp;the progress of the Y-Wing. In the end though, one person had&nbsp;the ultimate word.</p>

<p><img alt=""Russell meets with Dave Filoni"" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4616/39206407055_19523112b7_z.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></p>

<p>As the supervising director, Dave Filoni&nbsp;had final say on pretty much everything and was fantastic to work with. He did a great&nbsp;job managing all of us nerds even as we pestered him constantly about what this Y-Wing would look like.</p>

<p><img alt=""Dave reviews color"" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4671/39206406015_35702b22c4_z.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></p>

<p>There are multiple phases in the review&nbsp;process, here Dave reviews the color design of the Y-Wing, and it takes a LONG time for something to go from drawing to approved asset.</p>

<p><img alt=""model review"" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4723/26231646578_7537165a11_z.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></p>

<p>Above is the big moment when we first saw the final model of the Clone Wars Y-Wing and I have to admit (I&#39;m the guy in the hat) the first thought in my head was, &quot;I can&#39;t wait to buy the Lego set!&quot;</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>There has been a lot said about what goes into making the&nbsp;awesome sets that we here all love. I wanted to give just a brief glimpse of what goes into making the things those sets are based on. It takes a whole lot of people who care and love what they do to make something that winds up being a toy in a kid&#39;s hands. Like those kids, I never stopped loving those little interlocking bricks and can only hope that the show I had a small part in making continues to inspire kids to build. Happy 10th&nbsp;Anniversary Clone Wars! Happy 60th Anniversary Lego!</p>

"BrickFactoryINC","2021-10-26T04:31:02.567Z","My first set","<p>My very first set was the imfumis clone wars Y wing from 2009.&nbsp; When I was young this set took me half a day to complete but it was awesome.&nbsp; With good minifigs even though they were in the Clone Wars show style.&nbsp; The set has aged well in my opinion with another hopefully being made soon (fingers crossed) even still being the only set of its kind even though it has many appearances in the show.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite those facts, the set looks and feels good mines missing a few pieces here and there but I love it.&nbsp; The spring missile was tedious at times and the minifigs have survived with cracks along&nbsp;both Anakin and Ahsoka&#39;s torso but that&#39;s what you get when you get a set from 2009</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But this is an iconic ship that not just every original trilogy lover needs but all the clone wars junkies need as well very cool ship.</p>
