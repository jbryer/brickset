"MayTheBricksBeWithYou","2009-05-22T13:17:12.92Z","What a set!","I picked this set up in a TRU in Germany and the first thing you notice on the shelf is the enormous size of the box. I expected to see a few bags and a lot of empty space inside, but I was relieved to see multiple (numbered!) bags filling the box quite good. 

There are two instruction manuals topping 140+ pages in total. The build is divided into three separate builds each with their own numbered bags. 

First of is the Ewok trebuchet, the Ewok flyer and the two speeder bikes. The flyer has two cloth 'wings' holded together by four fishing rods! They included a translucent stand for the flyer for diorama purposes. Very nice! I like the speeder bikes very much, they're my first! 

Next up is the AT-ST which uses a rather useless walking mechanism which you only can use when you lift it up in the air. But nice nevertheless. The detail of the whole unit is very nice. The general look is very true to the movie. It also uses two printed flat rounded bricks on the back. There are no stickers in this whole big set! Very nice LEGO!

And last, but certainly not least, is the shield generator bunker. It uses a lot of dark green and dark grey ground plates, a nice addition. Also included a lot of flat dark grey bricks for all the wall detailing. The control room is very nice and quite big. It uses six (!) printed bricks for all the controls which can be reached using two rotating chairs. It uses some Technic to make the exploding walls, which work great by the way! 

Included are 12 (!) minifigs with three new Ewok figures, Chewbacca, Han Solo and  Leia (with a nice hairpiece!). Only downside is that the helmets won't stay on properly, a problem that plagues the CW Anakin as well. I hope LEGO fixes this soon.

Let's break it down:

Pros
+ A big and complete set to replay the 'Battle of Endor'. 
+ Detailed AT-ST
+ A lot of nicely detailed minifigs
+ Two speeder bikes
+ A lot of weaponry

Cons
- Helmets won't stay on properly
- Where's C-3PO? (Or isn't he supposed to be there, I can't remember).

The only thing I have to do now is to find a nice spot to put this huge set! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Tb96","2009-05-30T09:41:01.233Z","Ewok attack! (There's only three of 'em)","I don't know why this set came to sweden earlier, but I got it, so I'll review it.

Theme: Starwars

Set: The Battle of Endor

Number: 8038

Year: 2009

Minfigs: R2-D2, Chewbacca, Han solo, Princess Leia, Rebel Commando (x2), Paploo (ewok), Wicket (ewok), Chief Chirpa (ewok), Biker Scout (x2), Imperial Trooper.

Okey, we can start with the Base/Shield generator

Well I like the design on this part of the set. I also like how the doors justs go up and I love the blowing up function.

AT-ST

I got the older version of AT-ST. The newer look more like the real ones in the movies, thats all...

Speed bikes   

These bikes are almost the same as the one from the Gunship (I got an review on that one, its very bad so don't read it). the only difference is that it fits two minfigs and the front.

All Ewok things/catapult and the glider

The catapult can fire very far, maybe to an Galaxy far, far away.
And the glider is very nice touch (It's hard to build the wings but it's worth it) and the droping stone function works pretty well.

Good Stuff:

Everything!

Bad Stuff:

I don't know but weren't C3PO there? (anyway)

It's not the best prices and C3PO isn't there but it's good anway.  5/5

"gratefulnat","2009-06-07T18:19:31.92Z","Blast open that bunker!","This set contains 890 pieces, 12 minifigs, 6 computer console prints (no stickers), comes in a tear-at-the-corner-and-flip-up-the-top box, with two instruction booklets (84/62 pages). The parts-bags are numbered 1-3, which makes sense with this piececount as it is a great playset and I'm sure a lot of kids will be building it.

Bag 1: Minifigs and accessories

- Chewbacca, Han Solo, 2 Scouts as in earlier sets
- Imperial Trooper, R2-D2 (silver head) as in 10188.
- 2 Rebel Commandos and princess Leia, all three come with new torso prints. Leia also has a new hairdo (Mine came with a hole in the middle, so I bet there will be a new keychain later on, but LEGO is sending a replacement.) plus the rebels have different faces. I believe the bearded one is new and the other is the same face as DV's apprentice from set 7672 Rogue Shadow. The Rebels' helmets have some nice details, really like them a lot, just hope they don't don't lose any of their clutching power over time. The backpacks are dark green tooth pieces, looks o.k.
- The Ewoks Palpoo, Wicket, Chief Chirpa: The head pieces are molded very well, good details, and the facial colorings (lips, nose, eyes, decorations on the head scarves) really jump out. The eyes are actually a little creepy (dare I say even a little evil looking), other than that superb! Plus chief Chirpa has a neat little staff - like those details, LEGO.

- The catapult is simple but quite sturdy, and it flings those stones right across the room. I'd say LEGO's best mini-catapult to date. It has clips for the spear and bow as well, so if the ewoks aren't holding them they won't get lost.

- The speederbikes are nearly identical to the one in 7676 CW Gunship, except LEGO added a 2x3 plate where the backpack is attached, so there's space to seat a second figure.

- The glider's body is sleeker than in the old ewok attack set, and holds up very well. A barrel is held in place by a clipped on droid arm, so when flying around you don't lose your ammo. Nice litte detail. It comes with a clear translucent stand which works just fine.

Bag 2: AT-ST

I believe this is LEGO's best AT-ST to date. The proportions are close to the real thing, and it looks good from all sides, not at all chunky or blocky. Nice mixture of parts: technic, wings, tiles, clip-hinges (for lack of a better term) and parts for detailing. It comes with a flickfire, and surprisingly the head doesn't fall apart when flicking the missile. The head attaches to the rest of the body with a 'round turret swivel plate,' which unluckily offers no resistance so the head can swivel around on its own accord. Once I got it all together and standing, it was pretty wobbily, but it hasn't fallen over yet...
The legs move in opposite directions by turning a cog at the back, and to be honest it looks absolutely ridiculous, although also absolutely hilarious (Monty Python's 'Ministry of Silly Walks'), but it's quite a nifty little technic build. To use this function you have to lift the AT-ST up in the air and hold it by its head and turn the cog, and I was happily surprised as it didn't fall apart while walking it - so the model is sturdier than it first appeared to be. The one thing missing in my opinion is a computer console print for inside the cockpit, all one gets is a 2x2  plain sloping brick. I like it - but when it ends up in battle, the wobbiliness will be its weak point.

Bag 3: The Bunker

The build is not too complicated, except for the spring-release function (4 shock-absorbers are used) used for blowing out the four corner side panels, which is triggered by pushing down the round plates on the roof. It works very well - good job LEGO! The rest of the side panels are just inserted into the bunker structure, so one can knock those out by hand as well and blow up the whole bunker.
The bunker door is opened by turning 2 seperate cogs, so you have to open each side seperatley or use both hands at the same time. I think it would have been really cool if LEGO had made it possible to open the left and right side at the same time by using only one cog - minor complaint.
There are a whole bunch of slopes/inverted slopes plus corner slopes, some nice dark green plates, and SIX prints for the command center (so why not for the AT-ST, LEGO?) and the field generator is built using 4 orange cones. The interior is a little too sparse for me, considering the price, but one can open out the 2 side walls, which I like because then I get to change the scene around. They lock into position by clipping onto the inside front wall, and when I tried to open them out I ended up pulling the wall to pieces. :(
The bunker is fun, and the proportions work well with the AT-ST. I do think the interior could use some 'fleshing out', and a little more greenery for the outside would have also have been nice - but one can add that oneself.

This really is a fun playset, so if you don't want your kids blowing it up all the time when you're not blowing it up, you better put it out of reach. I really can recommend this set for playing and/or collecting, and had a fun time building it. I give it a 5 out of 5.

"Brickman193","2009-06-27T11:26:13.45Z","""On the Forest Moon of Endor...""","This is definitely the highlight of SW LEGO this year. Everything in this set is worth the somewhat hefty price tag, but I can easily overlook the $$ with all the impressive features set 8038 has to offer.

MINIFIGS
Everything minifig is awesome. It's pretty cool to have a flesh coloured Han Solo and Leia, especially if the mega Death Star is a bit too pricey. We get the brand new Rebel jungle commandoes, revised and improved Ewoks (three of them), a Death Star trooper and the returning favourites including Chewbacca, 2 of the old Scout troopers and R2-D2.

An noticeably absent C3-PO irks me, but having a few spares of the protocol droid meant I was happy to commit one to the diorama. But if you lack a C3-PO, I guess it could be a problem with the set. Others have noted that the set lacks an AT-ST driver, which is also disappointing (but still, 12 minifigs is most impressive). 5/5

THE BUNKER
The shield generator is very well done. It consists of three, modular sections - the front entry, the left generator wing and the right generator wing. The gimmick in this bunker is that when you push down on the grey dishes of the roof, the front walls explode off. Pretty cool, and not as complicated a build as you might think. 5/5

THE CATAPULT
The catapult serves as a little warmup before the intensive AT-ST and the bunker. It is a small, light build, but considering its number of pieces it can throw LEGO bricks a surprisingly long way. Looks great when manned by the Ewoks against the AT-ST. 5/5

THE AT-ST
My only major grumble about the set. This is the All Terrain Scout Trooper Mk 3, being the third reinvention of the famous ""chicken walker"". Granted, it's the most movie accurate build out of the 3 designs, but it is quite frail, and not that well built - compared to Mk 2, which only came out 2 years ago and still holds up well. The gimmick of swinging legs to simulate movement only works when you pick up the vehicle, not when you want to keep it earthbound. Definite room for improvement here. 3.5/5

THE SPEEDER BIKES
Like the AT-ST, the speeder bikes are constantly redesigned. If memory serves me right, this is the 5/6th version of the bikes, and they are definitely movie accurate. Each bike holds two minifigs each, like in the film, and the handles of the vehicles are spot on. Hopefully they will keep this design in future. 5/5

THE GLIDER
The Ewok glider is an amusing thing, and a vast improvement over the clunky yet frail first version that came out a while ago. The wings are fabric, stretched over four rare black fishing rods. For the diorama enthusiasts, the glider comes with a translucent stand. Top stuff, LEGO. 5/5

All in all, the set is well worth it, standing at $199 AUD. The minifigs, vehicles and buildings are all pretty unique now, so buy this set the moment you see it!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"xingying","2009-06-06T11:50:48.28Z","In the woods of Endor","Base/Shield generator
Pros: The design of the structure is very cool. The blowing up function of the walls is awesome. 
Cons: None.

AT-ST
Pros: Very nice AT-ST put together by Lego. The legs are moveable with a wheel that you turn on the back of AT-ST. Good design compared to the ""real"" one from the movies.
Cons: I miss an AT-ST driver. And there is something about the feet I don´t like. They don´t look really finished.

Speed bikes
Pros: I ilke that you can fit 2 minifigures on to the rear. Better looking handles than the speed bikes from set 7128.
Cons: That the front part and the back part is connected with one joint so that the front can move to the sides.

Ewoks with catapult and glider
Pros: The catapult is very nice and can really shoot the bricks far away. Duck and cover! The  glider is very nice. The ewoks are much more detailed with painted faxes.
Cons: None

Minifigs: 
Pros: Very cool set of minifigs. Twelve of them. I love the rebels and the death star trooper in his black outfit and helmet.
Cons: I miss C3P0 and an AT-ST driver to throw out of the hatch!

Total: Amazing set! I love it.

"THX_1138","2009-09-19T10:17:20.81Z","Very Nice!","This is a very good set, with little ways to improve it without raising the price too much.

Pros:
-The price wouldn't be that bad at $100 for almost 900 pieces even if it didn't have twelve incredible minifigs.
-It has three new ewoks with printing on the hoods; two rare scout troopers (I hope they release an Endor battle pack with some) with some of these and a bike or two but for a good price; two awesome Rebel commandos with awesome helmets and torsos (hopefully there will sometime be a battle pack with these guys too, and maybe some Ewoks); an Endor Leia with new hair (not a new piece, just new for her); Han Solo (I have been collecting Lego Star Wars for maybe five year, but this is my first one...); a new R2-D2, Chewbacca (again, my first one); and an imperial trooper, previously seen only in the Death Star playset. I hope to see more of these. I know people are complaining about eh lack of a Luke, and while an Endor Luke would be nice, he technically wasn't in the battle of Endor.
-Two awesome bikes, similar to the one in the Republic Gunship bur not quite the same. Another one (or two) would have been nice to recreate the chase, but that would raise the price, and some people wouldn't want three or four of the same vehicle in one set.
-An awesome new AT-ST, which finally has the correct head shape, and can easily be modded to be a two-seater with this guide (not mine): http://www.flickr.com/photos/28192677@N06/3769225563/
-The bunker is nice, and the exploding feature works well.
-The ewok vehicles and weapons are pretty nice, but nothing too special.
-The controls in the bunker are very good.

Cons:
-The AT-ST's walking feature works okay, but means the legs can't look as good as the would with normal legs.
-No controls in the AT-ST.
-The At-ST's hatch isn't very good.
-No AT-ST pilot.
-No C-3PO.
-An Imperial officer would have been nice too, but I would prefer the above figs to an Imperial officer.
-I'm kind of afraid to move the bunker (it's still in the same place I built it in almost a week ago), as it's quite fragile, and is a bit of a nightmare to reassemble.

"timqua","2009-08-14T23:48:59.14Z","Great set","At first I had me reservations about this set, but once I got it and built it, I realize it is a must buy.

The set has 12 minifigures, including 3 well-detailed ewoks. Camo Leia is fairly rare. The rebel commandos are well-detailed, one having a beard, and even have ""backpacks.""

The build is straitforward with excellent instructions. The bags are numbered which I appeciate and there are no stickers. The build is not monotonous until you get to the walls. They do not attach but sit in their space very well. The anterior walls on the front and sides pop out with a press of a button on the roof and this works very well. The front door opens smoothly. The inside will swing open for play--this makes it very practical for doing so. Detail inside is fair, but there is plenty of room for modding. The bunker is very sturdy.

The walker is excellent. The legs move but it will not ""walk."" It is nicely detailed and can fit a minifig inside who may also stand as pictured on the box. This is one of my favorite walkers. Very nice.

Two more speeder bikes are included, as well as an ewok glider which has a clear stand which is very good for displaying.

The ewok ""boulder"" launcher works very well, sending blocks 2 feet away.

"capnrex","2009-07-25T08:05:37.547Z","The Battle Of Endor","This brand new Lego Star Wars summer set is a must have! It has all of the components you need to make a huge battle, which is often not the case with some Lego Star Wars, in most you get just one vehicle and possibly a couple of figures for it to fight against, but this set has eliminated that problem (and then some)

I will start with the figures, the figures in this set are simply astounding! You get Wicket, Paploo, Chief Chirpa, Han Solo, Princess Leia in Endor Uniform, two rebel commandos, two imperial scouts, an imperial officer (it is actually a death star trooper, but it is a very good likeness to the commander of the bunker in the film) and of course R2-D2 with the new grey head piece. There is just one more thing to say about the minifigures, why does everyone keep commenting about the fact there is no Luke Skywalker? He did not participate in the Battle Of Endor! He was on the second Death Star at the time! Therefore, it would not have been accurate to have included him.

Nw on to the vehicles, the speeder bikes are very nice, with some backpacks which you could attach on your scouts or whoever, if you felt so inclined. The Ewok glider is a great design, using fishing rod pieces as support for the realistic fabric wings and with a cool new stand for people who want to create dioramas. The Ewok catapult is fantastic, it flings the grey 'Rocks' a long way, often over two metres if done properly. Last but not least, is the AT-ST, which I think is amazing, it looks so realistic, with the angular shape of the head and the heel spurs on the feet. It has room inside for one minifigure to be seated and has accurate weapons on the outside of the vehicle, including a flick missile, which I actually quite like! Thre is a hatch on top to access the inside, and I love the walking feature which although it could do with a point of articulation at the feet is still very clever indeed.

Finally, the bunker itself, which is for me without doubt th best part of the entire set. The sliding doors are very smooth and the fact that it opens out is great, but the very best thing about this entire set, I think, is the exploding feature, it is very simple but so effective and really looks like it could be exploding! The look of the base from the outside is extremely accurate, with the lovely mix of light and dark grey, and the pieces of greenery added for extra detail, which just show that Lego put so much effort into portraying the scene accurately. The inside of the bunker is well laid out with two swivel chairs, a large control console and the shield generator itself.

Overall I cannot mark this set down for anything, I think the price is reasonable, the figures are awesome, the vehicles are fantastic and the bunker is possibly the most accurate building from Star Wars they have ever created.

"Carl","2009-12-30T18:28:15.03Z","The Battle of Endor","This review will review all the different components in the order that you build them. I will do minifigs last.

Ewok Catapult: 5/5

Seriously, this part of the set is awesome. Rather than having to push down the other end of the catapult like the usual ones, this particular catapult has two 'archaic steering wheels' as I call them, which you turn to make the catapult fire. Only criticism is that it sometimes doesn't go down automatically.

Speeder Bikes: 5/5

I absolutely LOVE these! They are much better than the old ones. They are built in a similar way to the one in the old AT-TE, except in brown. And I am SO glad that LEGO put two in this set, letting you recreate the chase scene between a scout trooper and Paploo, or if you have an Endor Luke, you can make the chase have him and Leia on one rather than Paploo. Genius LEGO!

Ewok Glider: 4/5

This is probably the most disappointing feature of this set. I do really like the wing pieces on it and the rock dropping mechanism - primitive Ewoks! - but it is rather annoying that you need an Ewok inside it for it to stay properly together. A little disappointing, but it is still a welcome part of the overall set. You couldn't have a Battle of Endor without and Ewok Glider!

AT-ST: 5/5

This chicken-walker is the one that looks most like the chicken-walkers in the movies. It is awesome! The walking feature is kinda a waste of time because it can't actually walk while on the ground but its the thought that counts. Chewbacca can go inside and take control and you can have him standing up or sitting down. Also, the head lean of this chicken-walker is exactly like the movie. Well done LEGO!

Endor Shield Bunker: 5/5

The Final part of this set. And it has to be said: "" TEN MILLION THUMBS UP TO LEGO!"". I think that George Lucas should replace C3-PO with the head of the LEGO Star Wars department in the part when all the Ewoks are worshipping him. He deserves it! The exploding wall feature is one of the best functions EVER created by LEGO. It works perfectly! I think I'm addicted because I seem to be pushing the buttons about a million times a day. The sliding doors are also a welcome function, except for the fact that they do not slide together - there are two cogs, one for each door - and they do not stay entirely together. There is a crack in between the two doors just wide enough for a certain Imperial Control Trooper to stick his gun out and get a promotion for killing three of the top four most wanted Rebels by the Empire. Anyway, its still awesome because the Rebel Commando with the moustache would probably do it first because he is smarter.

Minifigs: 10/5

The minifigs in this set are to DIE for! There are THREE Ewoks, - new design, including Wicket, Paploo and Chief Chirpa with his awesome 'horned binocular' staff - TWO extremely rare Imperial Scout Troopers, TWO never-before-seen Rebel Commandos, one with a moustache and one without, and ONE black Imoerial Control Trooper, also never-before-seen, a new Endor design Leia, a new grey headed R2-D2, and those classic old ones Chewbacca and Han Solo. In total, that makes 12 awesome minifigs to complete an awesome set.

"David1971","2009-10-28T17:55:39.78Z","Superb design, very playable, and a great bunch of minifigs!","Review of Battle of Endor

A brilliant set - so nicely done, and a real credit to the care and attention, and creativity, that Lego put into the design of their sets.

It's quite expensive, of course, but compared with other sets it's superb value, with 12 lovely minifigs - including three Ewoks, very nicely realised here, and an Endor version of Leia, etc - and you get lots of playable, well designed stuff: the base, the AT-ST, two speeder bikes, Ewok glider, and a catapult.

The base is very good - it's pretty much a proper building, for once, and not just a facade. The sliding doors operate very smoothly at the turn of a wheel. The colours - dark green and greys - look great. And the 'exploding' mechanisms, that blow four of the side panels off, work unusually well: those panels really do go flying off, and the buttons are cleverly 'hidden' in the design, as air vents (or whatever), which is neat.

There are other long reviews on this site which do this set justice, so I won't repeat all their points. But overall, this is a lovely set with many interesting parts to it, and a great bunch of minifigs. It looks better in real life than in photos or on the box (whereas with most things in life it's the other way round!). And you very thankfully don't have to add pesky stickers to make it look right.

Finally, an important point I think:

The set is nicely designed and great to look at and play with - but not *too* complicated. Which is great. Some of the bigger Lego sets these days are just so ridiculously complex and technical, which means they are not so fun to build, and also can be less than inspiring because you end up feeling like you could never make such a complex machine or modular model yourself.

"sudorum","2009-10-14T14:57:26.89Z","A True Lego Base","<p>This is a major upgrade from the original ewok sets. It comes with three ewoks, and luckily they are each uniquely designed with distinct colors. The two speeder bikes are very similar to the one featured in the Republic Gunship set, though I&#39;m not really complaining because&nbsp;they&nbsp;are still nice additions. The ATST is well constructed in the top section. It has ample room for Chewbacca to commandeer its frame. However, the legs are a different story. They&#39;re incredibly flimsy, and when you turn the gear in the back to make the machine &quot;walk,&quot; the ATST topples over. Kind of defeats the point of having a walking mechanism.&nbsp;My other complaint concerns the rebel troopers&#39; helmets. Strangely enough, they don&#39;t seem to resemble standard Lego pieces. I could just be paranoid, but they almost appear &quot;duploish.&quot; Anyway, the base has exploding exterior walls, and two independently moving doors which slide open&nbsp;through the use of gears. The inside of the complex contains gun racks&nbsp;and a computer station with two chairs. Though it&#39;s relatively&nbsp;simple, this structure can actually be considered a base, unlike the horrendous Hoth rebel door!</p>

"AFOSL","2009-10-25T15:37:29.577Z","Set of 2009 Contender (Part 1: Packaging, Manual, and Minifigures)","Every now and then Lego will release a set that exceeds expectations and excels in new levels of brilliance and design, and gives this reviewer a deeper appreciation of Lego and the thought the company places into it's models.  As much as I love the Star Wars range of sets, not all have this same effect on me.
In 2002 it was the excellent Republic Gunship, in 2005, the surprising Sandcrawler, in 2006, the faithfully reproduced Slave 1, and this year it's the Battle of Endor set that provided most of the surprises and excitement.
Although Lego as a toy is aimed at the younger collector, The Lego Company does listen to it's army of adult fans and it does occasionally release a set that would certainly speak to an adult fan in a way only an adult fan of Lego would understand.
What I'm trying to say is that I feel an adult fan of Lego sees a Lego set in an entirely different way to how a child would see it, and Lego understands this also, and responds accordingly by producing a set with a lot of neat touches that a child might easily overlook or not understand or care about.

This extra care and attention given by Lego starts even before the construction of the model begins.
The packaging is different.  Gone are the perforated tabs that required you to tear into them, damaging the attractive box in order to open it.  Now the box is sealed with a sturdy piece of tape on each end that only needs a small slice with a sharp knife.  Once the box is open, the bagged contents can be poured from the box, quickly and easily.  And the box will still look good, should you wish to keep it.
On closer inspection it will be noticed that some pieces of this set are bagged individually.  To offer some protection from scratches, the Ewok head pieces have been individually sealed in their own soft plastic wrapper. This is a good thing too, as these new Ewok pieces have some great paintwork added that really brings the moulding to life.  Their plastic wrappings each have a small tear or nick along one edge to facilitate easier opening.  This is another one of those neat little touches added by Lego that could easily go unnoticed by the more casual builder.
The delicate looking wings for the Ewok glider are also safely ensconced within their own protective sleeve.

In recent years it has been quite common for Lego to divide the instruction manual of larger sets over two booklets, Battle of Endor is no exception.  These are thick A4 sized booklets though.  Book one weighs in at a hefty 84 pages, book two being smaller, but still contains a further 64 pages.
The instructions are laid out in the usual manner, clear, precise, and easy to follow.  This is, in part, down to each stage having it's own piece diagram/list printed alongside it.  Using the diagram should help cut down on the number of times a builder might wonder if all the parts required were indeed used in that stage.
The Endor set comprises of several different models, and the instructions deal with each one in turn, starting with the smallest; The minifigures.

Exquisite is a word that sprang to my mind when assembling the figures. I'm a fan of minifigures and believe that they can make or break a set.  Look at the excellent Greedo in set 4501, and compare it to a rather lack lustre pig guard in 4480.  A lick of paint wouldn't have gone amiss on that figure.
A lick of paint is exactly what the Endor minifigures get.  The Endor Rebel Trooper is amazing and very highly detailed.  Two are included in the set and both are easily identifiable as individuals.  One of the troopers has a brown beard, with eyebrows coloured to match.  The torsos are printed on both back and front with a utility belt, bandoleer, and subtle Endor camouflage.
The best part is the trooper's helmet.  This single piece is among the best moulds that Lego have produced.  I say single piece, but the helmet looks as though it could have been made of two pieces.  The main body of the helmet is moulded in a tan colour, but wrapped around it is a green ring which looks like a separate mould, slipped on and glued in place.  It's hard to tell how many pieces make up the helmet, but like I say, it is an exquisite moulding.  Once again, I think this type of excellent work by Lego is the sort that is largely recognised and appreciated by Lego's older fans.
The Leia figure also has a highly detailed torso piece with folds of her tunic, good camouflage and utility belt.  She also has a new hair piece to depict the style worn in the film, braided along the front, coming down into two buns at the back.  It's a very authentic mould, although from the front, it does seem to sit a little too high, leaving the princess with a large forehead.  The hairpiece also has a small hole in the top.  I'm not sure why, although I've heard it's to allow the fitting of a crown.  Maybe the hairpiece is used in another, non Star Wars set, and a crown is indeed fitted.

The new R2D2 figure is included in this kit.  Also found in two more expensive sets, this Artoo figure is much better than the last incarnation that has lasted all of ten years.
Whilst the body print is almost identical to every other R2D2, save for a bit more definition, the head is entirely different.  The head now consists of a grey dome and the print extends all the way down the body of the dome, giving this new Artoo a much more pleasing and authentic look.  I'm not sure why earlier Artoo figures, indeed any of the early R2 units were not printed this way.  Was it really so hard to do?
Han Solo and Chewbacca make another appearance in the Endor battle set, but have been seen a dozen times before.  It doesn't make them any less special or less of a joy to own, indeed they are excellent as always, it's just nothing new can really be said for them.
The same could almost be true for the Imperial troops.  The Biker Scouts have appeared before as Imperial troops in three other sets, and in one set as a Clone Biker, before Imperial rule.  The main difference between this Imperial and the earlier Imperials is that this one has a black head instead of a yellow head with a painted visor.
The other Imperial figure to be found here is a Death Star trooper.  It's a nice figure, but it's not entirely accurate.  His helmet appears to be that worn by AT-ST pilots, albeit moulded in black.  It's the wrong design.  Death Star troopers wear a flared helmet, more akin to the rebel trooper helmets found in set 7668, Rebel Scout Speeder.  The AT-ST pilot helmet makes a suitable substitute, but in a set as high calibre as this the proper moulding should have been made and provided.

Ewok minifigures made their first, and seemingly last appearance way back in 2002.  It was great to finally have Ewoks in my minifigure collection, but always felt there was a little something missing.  Don't get me wrong, the moulding for these early Ewoks was, and still is wonderful and highly detailed.  Fur, tassels, threads, stitch-work, and all the face details were born out in 3D detail in the old moulding.  But it's funny what a lick of paint can do.  The new Ewoks have very little of the 3D detail found in the old design.  Sure, their faces have a definable nose, eyes, mouth and fur, but all other details have been painted on.  The painted hood offers a lot of definition, helping to keep the Ewoks face the same colour as the rest of it's body, but the details on the hood are flat and painted in place.  The Ewok defining facial features, whilst being a fully realized mould, have also had a lick of paint to pick out the finer details - eyes, nose, mouth.  It really stands out.  So despite having very little of the surface texture found in early Ewoks, the painted features add definition and life to the figures that moulding alone doesn't accomplish.

In part two of my review I will move on to the design and construction of the various models contained in the Battle of Endor set.

"AFOSL","2010-03-09T19:50:04.653Z","Set of 2009 Contender (Part 2: Models And Construction)","In part one of my review of this set (posted 25/10/09) I focused on the packaging, manual and the excellent minifigures.&nbsp; In this next part I will concentrate on the rest of the model, or should that be models?&nbsp; Besides the minifigures, there are a further six models in the Battle of Endor set, contained within 3 separate bags.&nbsp; Sharing bag one with the minifigures are two speeder bikes, a catapult and the Ewok glider.&nbsp; Bag two contains all the elements required to build the AT-ST Walker and bag three contains everything needed to build the Endor bunker.<br>Dividing a large set like this into smaller sections helps speed up the construction and makes finding the required elements that bit easier, especially if you're not the type of builder who likes to methodically sort out their parts before building.&nbsp; I'm not the methodical builder, and after pouring the pieces from their bags, I spend a great deal of time scratching around in a pile of Lego bricks looking for the part I need.&nbsp; This method increases the time it takes to complete a model, but that can only be a good thing.<br><br><h4>The Catapult.</h4>The first model to be built when following the instruction manual to the diagram, is the Ewok's primitive rock launcher.&nbsp; The Lego design is simple but effective, and is able to launch small pieces of Lego quite some distance.<br>The catapult is built on two dark green plates and uses various brown and dark grey sloped elements in it's main construction.&nbsp; Two bright green plant elements are included to give the model it's authentic, organic forest feel.<br>The catapult mechanism itself is made up with Technic elements.&nbsp; This is all very well, and doesn't detract too much from the look of the model, but the parts are still moulded in black and light grey.&nbsp; Brown or tan might have been better and more in keeping with a weapon made entirely with materials only nature would have provided.&nbsp; Maybe I'm taking it all too seriously, but the Technic elements do lend an air of advanced technology to what is a primitive weapon.<br><br><h4>Speeder Bikes</h4>Two Speeder Bikes are included with the Endor set, and if I'm correct this is a third design for these models.&nbsp; The Lego Company have been expanding their range of bricks, elements and colours for as long as the company has been in business, and this is a good thing.&nbsp; Mostly.<br>For the sake of authenticity a lot of the new brick designs have been introduced to improve models and make them truer to their on screen counterparts.&nbsp; A classic comparison would be 7144 versus 6209.&nbsp; Both are models of Boba Fett's Slave 1, but 6209 is vastly superior to 7144, due to it being released almost six years later and using a range of Lego elements and colours that were not available when 7144 was released in 2000.<br>The same comparison could be made for all three designs of the Speeder Bike too.&nbsp; The original released in 1999 could be considered a little chunky.&nbsp; The rendition released in 2002&nbsp; improved upon the original basic design, but using some new parts which made the bike neater and sleeker.<br>But have Lego gone too far with this new design?&nbsp; It's a good design and brings the Speeder Bike model even closer to the real thing, but I can't help but feel a little cheated that the main chassis of the bike is a very big lump of plastic that requires no construction in itself.&nbsp; It's pre-assembled or at least, pre-fabricated, unlike the previous designs which required their main bulk to be assembled.<br>But like any true chassis, all other components must hang from it or be supported by it, and despite being one lump, the main chassis does require a whole host of other parts to be attached in order to turn it into a bike.&nbsp; A further 29 pieces to be precise.&nbsp; And just to reiterate, the bike is of a good design, with the handlebar set up and pilot position being very authentic and impressive.&nbsp; After two previous models, the Speeder Bike rider is now able to reach the pedals!<br><br><h4>Ewok Glider</h4><br>As I study every model in this review, I find it a little hard to not compare these new models with their previous incarnations, but I do also feel that such comparisons are noteworthy.<br>The glider in the Endor Bunker set is obviously different from the one found in 7139 Ewok Attack, but it uses many of the same parts.<br>The main difference lies in the wings.&nbsp; The old wings were made from shiny plastic sheet, like cellulose acetate and were not too bad at all.&nbsp; But the new wings are a big improvement.&nbsp; Out with the shiny plastic, in with fibre like material, similar to that found on capes worn by certain minifigures.&nbsp; The new wings are roughly twice the size of the older design and make the glider look much bigger than it really is.&nbsp; Without the wings, the glider is just a frame attached to a clear plastic stand.&nbsp; When completed it uses fewer than thirty pieces and stands about 15cm (6 inches) high.<br><br><h4>AT-ST</h4><br>Finally, Lego have produce a minifigure scale model of the Scout Transport that looks good.<br>When compared to the previous two models, this one certainly shines.<br>I feel as though Lego looked towards the UCS scale walker, 10174 from 2006.&nbsp; Like that model, the Endor Bunker walker uses plates in the construction of it's head/cockpit.&nbsp; The plates are all mounted on hinges which allows them to sit at the correct angles and give the walker's head it's distinctive shape.&nbsp; It's a sturdy construction and the walker can be picked up by the head without it falling apart in your hand.&nbsp; The head also sits on a turn table so is able to rotate left and right.<br>The walker comes fully equipped with double barrelled chin cannon, side mounted cannons, and a somewhat useless flick fire missile.&nbsp; Why Lego, why?&nbsp; I'm not a fan of flick fire missiles as I find that they don't really work too well.&nbsp; Also, on a model such as this, a flick fire missile seems very much out of place, and looks like a corn dog on a stick or rocket firework.&nbsp; A normal, scale like, single barrelled cannon would look much better.<br>The legs of this walker are a little on the skinny side when compared to the previous models, but they don't look bad or ruin the look of the model, although the blue Technic pins holding them together are quite visible.&nbsp; I have seen this pin moulded in both tan or grey in other Lego models and the use of those colours here would have been more appropriate.<br>The legs attach at the top to a type of differential gear box of peculiar design.&nbsp; Plenty of Technic elements are used throughout the gear box construction, and it's quite a neat, compact unit.&nbsp; The idea behind this differential is to allow the user to move the legs in a walking action by turning a gear piece at the rear of the model.&nbsp; It doesn't work.&nbsp; In order for the legs to move, the model has to be lifted clean off the floor.&nbsp; Not only that, but when in operation, the walking action looks more like the Can-Can dance as the legs just seem to kick high in the air, feet pointing towards the Death Star.<br>When grounded, the legs cannot move, so the model just stands there.&nbsp; But that's fine.&nbsp; It makes a good looking static model and is Lego's best rendition of the AT-ST so far.<br><br><h4>Imperial Bunker</h4><br>The final stages of construction deal with the bunker itself.&nbsp; These stages take up the last few pages of instruction manual 1 and take up all of manual 2, so you can imagine that building it takes a little time.<br>Laid on a base of dark green and grey plates, the bunker is an intriguing build and certainly had me guessing throughout.&nbsp; The front of the bunker uses a double wall design with various mechanisms sandwiched between the inner and outer layers. Various cogs and spring loaded Technic elements are used with no explanation as to what purpose they serve.&nbsp; Of course the builder could always jump ahead in the manual and take a peek at what's to come, but I'm not that kind of builder. One stage at a time and all will be revealed, in typical Lego style.<br>What looked like outer walls now had a pile of Technic beams piled up against them.&nbsp; Beams which would fall over at the smallest nudge.<br>Once the doors went on, things still didn't make sense.&nbsp; I thought the doors of the bunker would be on the outside, but they did nothing to hide these spring loaded pieces moulded in bright red and blue.<br>As the construction moves on, little details are added and the bunker starts to take shape.&nbsp; The outer walls are actually inner walls and the Technic parts are all slowly hidden from view.<br>The two doors are actually set back within an alcove and are operated by turning cogs, forcing the doors to slide open or shut.&nbsp; It all works very smoothly, and even at this stage, looks just like the bunker in the film.<br>About half way through the building of the bunker, things start to make sense, and the front of the bunker is ready for it's roof.&nbsp; The roof is made up of two large gridded plates through which slide Technic axles, each hidden under a dome or disc piece.&nbsp; The axle connects up with the spring loaded parts underneath, causing them to pop away from their upright position.&nbsp; The spring loaded pieces are easily put back in their original position and the mechanism is reset for the next time you decide to push down on the dome hiding sitting on top of that Technic axle.&nbsp; But even though you have fitted a roof and mostly hidden the inner workings of the bunker, you are still left with gaping holes in the bunker walls at this stage.<br>Construction continues by moving onto the side walls of the bunker and finishes off the interior control room.<br>Although the control room seats two minifigures, only one Death Star Trooper is provided, so he has to man the bunker by himself.&nbsp; He sits facing a bank of computer console screens.&nbsp; All these pieces are printed elements.&nbsp; There are no stickers in this kit, and that is certainly a good thing.<br>Like the front of the bunker, the side walls are also full of large holes between the support pillars.&nbsp; Don't worry about that though, as the final stages of the construction of the bunker require you to make eight separate wall panels.&nbsp; Each identical panel consists of two 4x4 plates, two 2x3 plates, one 1x2 plate and four 1x4 tiles.&nbsp; Once constructed, these panels just sit neatly in all the holes left in the walls of the bunker; two at the front and three either side.&nbsp; The front panels and front side panels rest up against the spring loaded Technic elements.&nbsp; Now when the domes on the roof are depressed, the mechanisms below spring open and push the walls clean off, simulating the dramatic explosion as the bunker is destroyed in the movie, Return of the Jedi.&nbsp; It's a neat little addition to the set and adds a play feature whilst keeping the model looking very authentic.<br>I feel the bunker could be a little taller as the minifigures are almost as tall as it, and it feels very low next to the walker which towers over it.&nbsp; If the bunker were two or three bricks taller it would bridge that gap, neither looking too short for the minifigures or dwarfed by the walker.<br><br><h4>Final Thoughts.</h4>The Battle of Endor set is one of the best Lego have produced, and gets almost everything right.&nbsp; The minifigures are wonderfully detailed, the AT-ST is the most accurate to date, the Speeder Bikes look swift and nimble, and the bunker itself oozes realism and authenticity, whilst managing to be a play set too.<br>Great care and attention also went in to the packaging of this set.&nbsp; Sealing delicate pieces in their own bags for protection was a nice touch and should be seen more on other Lego sets.<br>Price to piece ratio was also very good, making this set even more worth a purchase when compared to other releases which certainly pale in comparison.&nbsp; After building this set, and despite my little grievances with some of the design aspects, I now find other Lego sets somewhat lacking.&nbsp; The Battle of Endor has raised the bar and I would like all future Lego sets, big or small, to match the same level of sophistication, detail, design, and price per piece.&nbsp; <br>If I had to vote for my favourite Star Wars Lego set of 2009, I would choose the Battle of Endor.<br><br><br>

"Zacherano","2009-11-02T17:09:11.717Z","Superb Design and Movie-Accurate Details Provide Neverending Play and Display Potential","<h4>Introduction<br></h4>From the first moment I laid eyes on this well-designed collector's item and exceedingly fun set, I knew that this was, is, and will always be one of the best Lego sets of all time. Upon receiving this set after purchasing it in early July, I marveled at the beatuty of the box, the parts division into three useful buidling sections, and the movie-accurate details. Not ony does this set hold phenomenal play and display opportunities, but it is fun to build!<br><br><h4 style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">The Build</h4><p><br></p><h4>The Minifigures<br></h4>     The construction experience is divided into three segments: the Ewok weapons and speeder bikes, the AT-ST assault walker, and the Imperial shield bunker. The first part includes all of the minifigures, which include both new designs and familiar faces. The new figures include the Ewoks, which all possess small insignias on their hoods, such as orange leaves on Paploo's tan hood: the three Ewoks include Paploo, Wicket, and Chief Chirpa. The other new figures are the Rebel forest troopers, complete with detailed green, blue-gray, and dirty blond helmets, in addition to camo-green and gray body designs with bandoliers. Both Rebel troopers features different faces - one resembles Darth Vader's apprentice in The Force Unleashed, and the other appears similar to a middle-aged Obi-Wan. The remaining cast of minifigures include the classic Han Solo; a new Princess Leia with a short, tied up hairdo, green camoflouage shirt, and periwinkle legs; two Imperial Scout Bike troopers; the new, Death Star R2-D2 with more detail and a gray upper half; a Death Star trooper; and finally Chewbacca to man the hijacked AT-ST. The Ewok catapult is small but powerful, holding a bow and spear in the back and thrusting its gray brick across long distances. The glider is elegant and comes with a translucent stand so that it stands up above the shield bunker, almost level with the AT-ST. Finally, the two speeder bikes, which closely resemble the bike in the Clone Wars Republic Attack Gunship, are manned by the Imperial Scout Bike troopers, or Luke and Leia, if one is able to spare an extra Luke minifigure to add to the display. The bikes slide well across a number of surfaces.<br><br><h4>The AT-ST<br></h4>     The second divided section of the Battle of Endor is the AT-ST, an extremely movie-accurate model compared to the movie, Episode VI: The Return of the Jedi, and previous Lego versions of the Imperial walker. The cockpit smoothly lifts up. The legs are able to move up and down when one turns a knob at the back , but this feature only operates when the vehicle is lifted into the air (it still works well nonetheless). The build for the AT-ST includes regular and Technic pieces and takes perhaps 15 to 30 minutes longer than the previous section.&nbsp; The AT-ST also features a beautiful selection of pieces, some of which I had never seen before.&nbsp; I would say this is worth buying just for some of the rare parts.&nbsp; <br><br><h4>The Bunker<br></h4>     The final section, the Imperial shield bunker, is by far the largest and most complicated of the three parts, but it is also immensely satisfying when completed and displayed with the other parts of the set surrounding it. The bunker has dark green plates on the bottom sides, and green leaves along the top. One must endeavor to build the entire bunker slowly and carefully, for it is easy to collapse the half-complete bunker when attaching the two back sections. There are a number of functions of the bunker. The most obvious of these is that whenever the top gray curved pieces are pushed on either side, the front and side walls fall out, much like the bunker being blown up in the movie, if both sets of walls are pushed out at the same time. The back sections of the bunker may also be pulled out from the main bunker section to extend the length. There is a control computer, an orange cone powered generator, and seats inside the bunker. It is definitely roomy enough for multiple Imperials (probably about five could fit into the bunker at most). The bunker looks rounded off and well-designed when completed.<br><br><h4>Conclusion<br></h4>     Overall, I deem this to be one of the best sets in the Lego Star Wars line: great for display, for play, or even just to add to one's collection. Based on discussions with fellow Lego fans and my own perusal of reviews across the Internet, I think the set is phenomenally pleasing for all ages, from children to adult collectors! This is truly a masterfully designed set, recreating the battle from Episode VI in all its glory.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

Even though the ''walking'' feature is kind of stupid, this set is a battle scene unto itself.I really like the speeder bikes and biker scouts because I've always wanted them.I rate them 10/10. The AT-ST is a lot more movie acurete than the one released in&nbsp;2007, but I wish you could put more than one minifig in the cockpit. The base itself is really cool.I like how with the controls on the parts of the base combine with the controls in the middle of the base to form one big control panel when you close the base. The ewok catapult fires much farther than the flick-fire missles, and the glider is really cool.In the base, all the extra blasters really help arm the imperials to fight the rebels.The exploding door feature is pretty cool, even though the buttons on the top of the base to make the feature happen are really fragile.Anyway, that's my review.

"Alexpanter","2010-02-23T12:13:33.797Z","I do not know a title that makes sense","I did write this review with the set in front of me, and behind it my keybord. So thats a bit hard...

Packaging and construction:

I bought this set on-line for around 90 euros. It was delivered in a huge box, filled with paper, and somewhere under the paper I found the lego box. 
The box is closed with a few pieces of tape. Inside it are a lot of plastic bags. Some marked with a '1', other with a '2' and some with a '3' 

I opened the bags with the '1' on it first. This one includes all the minifigs, the speeder bikes and the ewok's equipment. The minifigs in this set are really amazing. But I am still missing a few things. There could have been more clones to defend the bunker. Also, there were more rebel troopers. Two more would not have hurt. And 3PO is not in the set too, and that's pretty sad. Also, the back of R2 is not printed. Auch. He looks so ugly with a white back. Just terrible :P. 

The bags marked with a '2' contain the pieces to make a AT-ST. Just like the AT-ST's in the movie, this walks silly. I see some people where complaining about it in their review, but I think Lego did something very good here :). 

Now about the bags with a '3' on them. These contain the parts for the Endor Shield Bunker. I just have to complain about one thing. The bushes keep falling over when I play with it :P

It took me 3 hours to build. And the result was worth every second.


Now something about the different parts of this set.

First the AT-ST. It is funnt grab its head, lift it up and turn the wheel in its back. The legs move very silly then :)
The 'head' can turn. Both the shutter in its roof and the roof itself can be opened. All the three guns can move. The flick missile sucks. It's hard to launch it further then five centimeters...

Second, the Ewok thingies. The catapult works very good. (But it is hard to aim :P) The flying thing wings are not stable. The good this is that in can bomb things. 

The speeders have new, very movie-accurate design. Only con is that it's hard to get the scout troopers in positon.

The doors of the bunker can open and close. The wall explode function is really amazing. Sadly, not all walls can explode :(.

The only thing I really miss in this set are some more minifigs. You will need more minifigs to recreate other scenes of the movie. But thats just the only big con.

<p>A really fun Star Wars play set that matches scenes from episode VI. Loads of minifigures, some unique. Several moving elements. Multiple vehicles for swooshing! Great playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Full Build Review</p>

<p>This&nbsp;set is packed full of minifigures. It&rsquo;s a blast from the past being a 2009 release but has stood the test of time with lots of playability &amp; some cool moving features.</p>

<p>The AT-ST is well designed &amp; looks the part. It includes a cockpit for one minifigure &amp; a flick missile on the side. A gear mechanism makes the legs move but it only works if you&rsquo;re holding it off the ground. The waist also rotates, good for getting clear shots off at all those rebel scum!</p>

<p>Two speeder bikes are included &amp; were my favourite builds. They&rsquo;re really fun to fly around &amp; re-enact those iconic scenes from Endor in episode VI.</p>

<p>The Ewok glider is a very simple build but looks good &amp; includes a bomb drop mechanism for knocking out stormtroopers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also get a working catapult which you can load with a brick &amp; flick launch. Like the glider, a pretty simple build but a lot of fun to play with.</p>

<p>The bunker is constructed in 3 sections. The first forms the control room &amp; main doors, which slide open with internal cog mechanisms. The other two connect so you can close the bunker or swing each side out to create an open play area. The coolest feature of the main bunker though is the EXPLODING WALLS! A quick press of the radar dishes &amp; the walls go flying out like you have blown the bunker. Great fun &amp; really simple to reset.</p>

<p>Overall a fun build &amp; very playable set. The minifigures were definitely the highlight for me but the bunker &amp; vehicles really capture the scene &amp; allow for hours of Endor recreations.</p>

This too isn't bad. I've got another Ewok Glider and comparing the two, out of newness, I do like this one better. There's a clear plastic stand for the Ewok to stand on so he looks like he's up in the air, gliding over head.</p><p>The third and fourth build are the Speeder Bikes that I love so much. This is a design that was repeated later in the 2010 Ewok Attack set. At this point, I could probably ask myself if I've got enough Speeder Bikes.</p><p>The fifth build is the AT-ST. I find this build a bit disappointing over all. The use of technic pieces makes it fantastic looking and appearance wise, far better than an older set featuring Chewie inside the AT-ST. What makes it so disappointing is that in order to have the legs of the AT-ST move, it has to be picked up in order to get the swing action of the technic gears. It isn't like the much older AT-ST model (that doesn't look as good as this model) that can move it's legs without having to be lifted up to get any gears moving. The legs are actually flexible and bend.</p><p>The sixth and last model is that of the Endor Bunker that the Rebels are trying to break into. This is a fairly involved and detailed build with the doors that can slide open and the level of detail. It is mildly disappointing that so many of the walls are just a flat panel that rests against the bunker. But I suppose that works if you want to show the Ewok catapult able to deal damage to it as boulders are hurled at it.<br></p><p></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>As a fan of the Original Trilogy, I also love the ewoks, so this set was very much so well worth picking up to add to my collection. I plan now to try and work out a huge LEGO diorama of all my Endor Star Wars sets in a huge display. I'll probably hold off til I get the Endor Battle Pack, but it should be worth it.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Where do I start? The Ewok catapult is amazing, you have really good control over its firing range, you can fire rocks from it from about 30cm to the other side of a room. I'm not joking!

It also has a cool feature where if you push down on some buttons, the walls explode.

It also comes with opening and closing doors - you can do this by turning some small wheels from inside the bunker.</li><li>I like the AT-ST a lot, it looks very like the one from the film, and you can move the legs by rotating a wheel at the back. You can open the top, put a minifig in the cockpit, and then close it again.</li><li>I really like the helmets for the scout troopers, and the scout bikes are also quite cool. There are a few places where you can put a blaster while your minifig decides to go on a ride</li><li>Rebel commandos are nicely detailed, one with a beard, and the other with a stern expression</li></ul>

"brickboyg","2011-02-08T07:15:09.06Z","Detailed review of The Battle of Endor 8038","I got this kit with my birthday money and I think it's ace!  Here's a detailed review:

Figures

Chewbacca - Cool hair effect, great chain over shoulder.

Chief Chirpa - Cool colours, nice decoration: thorn in silky turban.  Also has a great weapon.

Han Solo - Great holster, which is brown.  Torso is cool, with beige arms.  Nice hair!

Imperial Trooper - I like the torso with the silver belt.  Great hat!

Paplo - Ace realistic jungle-looking leaves on side of turban.  Realistic scar on bottom of turban.

Princess Leia - Pretty hair.  Nice uncommon coloured legs.  Great face.  Jacket has drawing on  back as well as front.

Rebel Commando Beard - Great hat!  Torso has a camouflage jacket with a dark green rucksack.  Also an amazing beard on face.

R2D2 - Standard R2 unit body, nice double sided grey and blue face.

Rebel Commando Frown - Same features as Rebel Commando Beard but with frowning face and no beard!

Scout Trooper x 2 - I like these better than Stormtroopers or Snowtroopers.  Cool modified helmet; great torso with pockets.

Wicket - Great reddish brown coloured turban.  Great face.  Scar on turban.

Weapons for figures - Cool rifle and blaster guns.  Chief's stick is also cool.

Pros

    * Ewok catapult fires rocks at least a foot.  It also has three spare rocks.
    * Ewok catapult also has a spear and a bow included.
    * Speeder bikes are like the ones from set 8084 (Snow Trooper Battle Pack).  The bikes have moving handles to fit the figure in any position from holding on to one handle to riding normally.  Speeder bikes also have a rucksack (brown) on the back and have guns/loudspeakers on the sides.
    * AT-AT Walker has guns that move up and down, firing missiles and an opening cockpit.
    * Bunker has walls that fly off when you press two buttons on the top.
    * Bunker walls have shiny flats every two dots up.
    * Cool green colour flats on bottom and sides of bunker.
    * Bunker has three excellent leaves on top and my favourite plants on the side (four from corner on the left side and one left and two up on the right side).
    * Bunker has sliding doors :-)
    * Inside the bunker there are two nice shiny black chairs on flats that spin.  Cool!
    * Great black slopes with controls and buttons printed on.
    * Bunker has four guns fixed on the walls (two long rifles and two ordinary blasters).
    * Bunker opens to have more room to play inside.
    * Great consistency of dark and light grey.
    * Mostly all symmetrical except from the leaves on top of the bunker.
    * Room outside the bunker to fit Leia and R2D2 (R2 looks like he is manning the controls, like in the film Return of the Jedi)
    * Ewok flyer is a cool addition.
    * Ewok flyer also has a see-through stick to stand it up on.

Cons

    * AT-AT Walker doesn't stand up very well.
    * AT-AT Walker can only walk if you hold it in the air!
    * Cannot carry bunker around and it's best to build it onto a big board.
    * Wings flap around too easily on Ewok flyer.

"Chills","2012-09-07T10:44:52.25Z","No Han, you shouldn't try hot-wiring the blast door....","<p>I'd been watching this set on eBay and BrickLink for a while, waiting to get a deal. I was about to give up when I was able to nab one on eBay for a great price. It was brand new, the box was open but every bag was still sealed. Score!</p><p>This set is just awesome. It ranks up there with the Death Star and SSD in my book. On to the review!<br></p><p></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The first thing I have to talk about is does this set take you back to the movies? Absolutely! You've got almost all you need to recreate the Endor battle. The details in the set are fantastic, LEGO did a great job modeling the set from the bunker and weapons used during the battle. <br></li><li>Pro 2: Instead of just building one model you get 6 different ones - The bunker, an AT-ST, a hang-glider, a catapult, and two speeder bikes. The build on each one was a lot of fun. I have other Endor sets and the models in this one are different, so when you get this set you're not duplicating builds.</li><li>Pro 3: I have the AT-ST 7657 which I think is a great set, but the AT-ST that comes with this is equally cool. Its neat to see how the LEGO designers each had a different take on the chicken walker and used different parts to build it. This AT-ST has legs that ""walk"" when turning a gear at the back. Pretty creative.<br></li><li>Pro 4: The hang-glider and the catapult are fun builds; they have thought behind the designs. The hang-glider even has a ""bomb bay"" to drop rocks on the bad guys. <br></li><li>Pro 5: The minifigures! You get Han, Leia, Artoo, two Rebel Commandos, two Biker Scouts, Wicket, Paploo, Chief Chirpa, Chewbacca, and an Imperial commander. Wow, 12 figures that are all great. I especially like the Ewoks and the Commandos. Great detail on all.</li><li>Pro 6: The bunker, such a fun build. I'm sure to keep costs down LEGO didn't make it very big, but they packed detail in it, including ""exploding"" walls. I like the technique of using plates and tiles for the walls. The doors also slide open and closed, and there are the generator columns in the back. The bunker walls open in the back so one can MOC up more walls and interior, expanding it.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: All I have to say I'd like to have seen a couple more Imperials in the set. This is Rebel-heavy. But I really can't complain much because you do get 12 minifigures, all are great.<br></li></ul>
<p>This is truly a wonderful set, so glad I got it. Its a fun build, it has great playability, its true to the movies, and has very cool minifigures. If you're building an Endor scene this is definitely the cornerstone set. If you're not this still is a wonderful set to have in your collection. <br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,3
"zipsforbananas","2012-09-10T10:53:22.56Z","Perhaps bit fragile for a playset, but great except for that.","<p>This is possibly the most complete playset Lego have done for the vintage Star Wars range, and it is very good overall, but has a few disappointing flaws. The review's quite long, but should be easy to navigate with the headings, and the summary pros and cons at the end. Enjoy!</p><p><br></p><p>The <b>Ewok Catapult</b> is the first thing you build and is fairly straightforward but really good. The green of the base and the plants that add hugely to the feel look great here, and will enhance the bunker too. The mechanism feels good to use, very simply weighted, and it works really well - easily the best projectile feature of any Star Wars set I've seen.</p><p>The <b>Ewok Glider</b> isn't quite next, but really should be mentioned now. I'm somewhat embarrassed that I found it awkward to build; I managed to confuse myself over how to attach the wings together, a little more care and thought sorted it out though. It's quite cleverly constructed, with the Ewok being integral to the structure! And it looks wonderful stood next to the catapult (although it's a little short next the tree from 7956, Ewok Attack).</p><p>Onto the Imperial forces then. The <b>Speeder Bikes</b> are built first and are very nicely made. It's a shame that it took Lego until 2012 to add the 2x2 round glide piece to the bottom, but they're simple enough to get hold of. For such a small vehicle they're well detailed with the backpack and loudhailer pieces. This ship hasn't changed much since this version either, the only real changes with later sets being how the prongs and plates at the front are held together, and the cover at the front, which I think is better here than the later longer pieces.</p><p>The <b>AT-ST</b> is one of the sets main features, and it is a strange mix of brilliance and flaws. The construction is fun and engaging; the plates around the head and the angles in the legs are especially nice. The way plates are attached vertically, and clipped on at angles on the side is great, giving a really good compact looking finish. The mix of the 4x8 plates with only a row of 2x6 studs on the sides, and the 1x4 plates and cheese wedge pieces on the front take away enough studs to give a cleaner look, and the dark grey top adds texture. The way the eye flaps are created, attached to the roof, with the ""bridge of the nose"" coming up from the front is fantastic.</p><p>The various pieces attached to the legs continue the great looks, the 1x4 curve up the centre of the feet, the dark grey 1x4 plate and the wheel arch pieces up the legs add great simple looks. And the way the angles are created to attach the legs to the main body are very impressive.</p><p>Unfortunately, those strengths also bring weaknesses, in that the panels on the head do get knocked off quite easily and are quite hard to reattach, and because of the way the legs are attached the walking feature is just plain comical - it looks like it's moonwalking! I'm happy to put up with that though, the angle and way it stands is just so good, and the compact look is well worth the hassle of occasionally knocking a piece off.</p><p>The <b>bunker</b> is final and main part of the set, and occupies well over half of the instruction booklet, so it's quite a long build and it does get a little intricate around the springs that will make it explode. The sloped pillars look wonderfully sturdy, and the pieces that go upright between them look magnificent, as well as the 'foliage-type-greebles' mentioned earlier. The sliding doors look great too, and the interior with the control desk and bright orange reactor-thingies do it justice. It's a brilliant looking structure and makes for a great focus to the battle, and I do really like it...</p><p>...but there are some problems you should know about too. The building opens out nicely to be quite a versatile playset, but there is only one plate-hinge on each joint, so they're quite flimsy, and the way the sides clip in place when the bunker is closed is very poor indeed. The clips resist going in place, and don't come away easily either, so you're in constant danger of pulling a wall apart! The base plates seem too thin too, and come apart constantly as you're building it, and don't hold together too well when it's finished either. I've added plates to the bottom to give it more strength.</p><p>And lastly, the great explosion function that is really good fun is also very&nbsp;temperamental, chucking pieces out when you're just moving it around. It's impossible to pick it up without one side or the other of the wall panels falling out too -not a problem unless you are moving it, but very annoying when you are!</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, a quick review of the <b>figures</b>:</p><p>You get a fantastic 12 of them, and some are a little bland, but they're a perfect selection for recreating battles, and the climax of the whole scene.</p><p><b>Han</b> is great, and it's nice to have this version of him in a set that's less that £100!</p><p><b>R2-D2</b> and <b>Chewie</b> are pretty standard, but fit very well with the set.</p><p><b>Leia</b> is unique to the set and has good printing for her poncho, and her braided hair looks nice. I'm not sure why there's a hole in the top of it though!</p><p>The two <b>Rebel Troopers</b> look nice too, with good torso printing and nice scowls, and it's good to have a beard on one of them, just like in the films!</p><p>The <b>Ewoks</b> are marvellous, an infinite improvement on the old chocolate looking versions! All three are clearly the same mould, but <b>Wicket</b> and <b>Paploo</b>&nbsp;look surprisingly different with just different coloured ponchos, and <b>Chief Chirpa</b> looks great next to them in grey. (The two from Ewok Attack, one black, the other cream, make a great set.)</p><p>And the Imperial forces are a little&nbsp;sparse&nbsp;with no AT-ST pilot or stormtrooper, but the two <b>Biker Scouts</b>, though standard, are good, and the <b>Imperial Trooper</b> seems a bit bland since the TIE Fighter's Death Star Trooper came out with his fantastic helmet, but he's a good part of the set nonetheless.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A fantastic set of models for recreating the Battle of Endor</li><li>Brilliant looks, especially the AT-ST and the Bunker</li><li>Good features with the catapult, and the bunker's doors and exploding function</li><li>A great set of figures for recreating battles</li></ul>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-10-17T09:24:49.61Z","The Perfect Way to Capture the Battle for Endor!","<p>So I&#39;ve always loved Ewoks, they are quite possibly my favorite Star Wars characters. I know a lot of people see them as a cheap way to sell toys to kids, but I was a kid in the 80&#39;s and let me tell you, Lucas knew what he was doing!&nbsp;My kids just became old enough to watch the movies and we watched Return of the Jedi about a week ago, and let me tell you, they went crazy for the Ewoks, they were laughing hysterically and even my daughter who is only mildly interested in Star Wars couldn&#39;t take her eyes off the screen while there were Ewoks around.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;ve always been disappointed in how few Lego sets there have been from Endor and that included Ewoks, so recently I broke down and had to buy the Ewok village as well as this set. I haven&#39;t had a chance to build the village yet, but I just built this set and wow am I impressed. So let&#39;s dive into the review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set has a wonderful part selection. With lots of large plates, this is not a set that inflates its brick count with lots of small parts. It also includes a handful of parts that I&#39;ve never seen before including fishing poles and 1x4 plates with tire rims on one side. Plus it includes 4 struts which is not something you normally find in Star Wars sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most exciting things about this set is just how many minifigures it includes. You get 3 Ewoks. Chief Chirpa is included in the village, as is a different version of Wicket, but Paploo is unique to this set. All three look great and even if you already own the first two, they are still great for building up an Ewok army. I also prefer this version of Wicket over the one with more printing included in the village and the more recent action battle set,&nbsp;the single color for his fur just looks better, I suppose it is less cartoonish.</p>

<p>As for the rebels, Han and Chewie are pretty standard, although they are definitely necessary for this scene. R2 is the same exact minifigure you already own a hundred of, it would have been nice if they included a damaged R2 in this set, this was their best opportunity to really give us a special R2 minifigure and not just the same old one we already have. However, after these three things get exciting.&nbsp;Leia is unique as she is dressed in camouflage and looks fantastic, definitely a minifigure you will want to have. You also get 2 different generic rebels, and while they are pretty much identical, they do have different heads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the Empire, you get two biker scouts, which are pretty standard, but very important given you have 2 speeder bikes. You also get a trooper dressed in black, probably one of the guys working inside. He&#39;s pretty generic, but then again so was everyone on the ground of Endor. It would have been nice to get two of them, but it&#39;s hard to complain when they already gave you 12 minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Considering the time period, these are some of the finest minifigures I&#39;ve seen Lego produce for Star Wars, especially the Ewoks, Leia, and the two rebels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Catapult</p>

<p>There are 6&nbsp;separate builds (counting each speeder bike separately) in this set and the first one you make is the catapult. It&#39;s a fairly simple build but what do you expect from something so small. I will say that it doesn&#39;t look good. Had it been better camouflaged it could have been a really great mini-build, but oh well. I will say this however, it is far and away the best functioning Lego catapult I have ever seen. Its length and counter weight really allow the round bricks to go flying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Speeder Bikes</p>

<p>You get two of these guys, and if you&#39;ve ever built a speeder bike before from this time period, you pretty much know what to expect. If you haven&#39;t, these are really as good as they get, and the nonstandard bricks and connections make them a lot of fun to build. They do look great and I do love how they give you two of them, of course you will probably want to add more of these, but it&#39;s hard to argue for including more than two in any one set.&nbsp;I built them both together as opposed to one and then the other which I feel helps make it less repetitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hang Glider</p>

<p>This simple little build was maybe what I was most excited about. Not only is it very unique, but hang gliders played a major role in the Ewoks movies, and I&#39;ve always loved those movies. This, along with the minifigures, are what you can use to recreate scenes from those movies as I assume it is safe to say that Lego will never make any sets for those movies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build itself is actually pretty interesting as you use 4 fishing poles, a part I&#39;ve never seen before, to build the structure for the wings. They connect to a &quot;backpack&quot; with some technic. Then your Ewok will hold onto the hang glider and it is the Ewok, not the hang glider, that actually gets attached to the stand. The wings do flop up and down, but while on the base they will remain horizontal. The other fun feature is that Lego managed to squeeze in a rock that can be dropped from above, a very impressive feat given the very compact nature of the model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AT-ST</p>

<p>So I already own two AT-ST&#39;s, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75153-1/AT-ST-Walker"">75153</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75254-1/AT-ST-Raider"">75254</a>, not to mention a few mini ones. Compared to the two newer models I have, this one is much smaller and much less detailed. However this one has a major advantage over those two. In the two newer designs, the technic gear you can turn simply rotated the head from side to side, and the legs are completely rigid. In this set, the technic gear actually swings the legs back and forth in opposite directions. While the knees don&#39;t move, it at least allows you to give it the appearance of walking, even if it can&#39;t really walk or stand in any position other than straight up and down. The head also swivels freely in this set giving you another point of articulation, although it lacks friction which is a little annoying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like I said it isn&#39;t as detailed as the newer models, and it is much smaller. But it is perfectly fine nonetheless. I actually think that it&#39;s scale is quite appropriate alongside the shield generator building. My only real complaint is that you don&#39;t have a hatch for Chewie to pop out of, the entire top is the only part that moves, the hatch is purely decorative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a very fun build however. Yes, you build mirror images of the legs and the side panels, but the legs are interesting enough that you won&#39;t mind, and the panels are simple enough it isn&#39;t a big deal. Seeing how it is built and watching it come together is actually rather interesting. This might be the most enjoyable building experience in the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shield Generators Building&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally you get to the main build of the set, and given how much you&#39;ve already built, it is amazing that this build is still over half of the set. Like many Lego buildings, you build it up layer by layer. For the most part it is standard stacking, although at either corner you have two very complex technic builds that you know will support a play feature, but that feature isn&#39;t immediately clear and you won&#39;t really understand it until the model is complete. This mystery was a very pleasant surprise and keeps you excited as this feature is really ignored until the very end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will say that the base is very weak as you build it and only gets moderately stronger as the build continues. The central part of the model is especially weak, being held onto the rest by a measly two studs. Amazingly however it only broke off once while I was building it, and I was holding the model in my hand for most of the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back of the building has two corners that swing out, but both are connected by a single hinge at the bottom which is completely insufficient. When closed however, there is a clip on either side that attaches to a bar, so at least you have tow points of contact which makes it much stronger.&nbsp;And just like the front of the building, the base is very weak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do intend to reinforce the base, and will definitely add another set of hinges to the bottom, but of course two sets of hinges so close together aren&#39;t going to do a whole lot of good. Because the roof of the front portion overhangs the back portion by a stud, it would be very difficult to integrate hinges on top without a major redesign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building is of course perfectly symmetrical, but since you are building both sides at the same time it doesn&#39;t feel too repetitive. The model itself is actually very good looking and accurately reflects the building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also has two play features. That overly complex technic build which includes the use of shocks is activated when you push down on the two circles on the roof. Each one blows out two exterior walls, one in front and one on the side, as if you set off thermal detonators inside. The best part, you just put the wall segments back and the shocks go back into place and are ready for the next explosion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other players feature is the blast doors which can be open and shut by turning gears. As you build it this feature will not work very well, but once you get enough structure around it, they actually work very well and look very nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>I spent about 3 very enjoyable hours building this model. Typically I don&#39;t like sets with lots of separate builds as it makes a large set feel like several smaller ones, but this set is an exception to that rule. The AT-ST is a very substantial and complex build, while the shield generators building is still a substantially large build and features some rather complex technic building. Both of these models are very attractive and a lot of fun to build and play with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hang glider, while small, is very unique and a wonderful addition to your Endor collection, as are the two speeders. The catapult is easily the weakest part of the set, and arguably the only weak part of the set, but since it works amazingly well I can almost forgive it. Besides, it would be easy enough to build up some trees around it which would make it look a lot better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only thing this set is missing is the forest, but you certainly can&#39;t expect Lego to include a first in a Star Wars set. However, adding some trees maybe a project that I want to take up in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set really gives you everything you need to recreate the scene from the movie, and that is quite the accomplishment given how much was going on in the movie at this time. While I wish Lego would release more Endor sets, and I&#39;ll probably buy them if they do, seeing how they made so few so far, I just don&#39;t see them creating a set like this I the future. I&#39;m very happy with this set and do highly recommend it to anyone who loves Star Wars, but especially to anyone who is a big Ewoks fan like me.&nbsp;</p>

"TimTam22","2017-11-21T08:54:20.42Z","Endor Base - a fun set","<p>My Mum bought this for my older brother for half-price due to a mis-labelling&nbsp;incident in K-Mart, so&nbsp;this set was amazing value for money for us. My brother loved it so much that he tried to stop me from building multiple times, just so he could instead!</p>

<p>The building was an interesting experience when making the glider, catapult, and speeders, but by the time I got to building the base itself, the fun dropped a little. Particularly when having to build 8 of the wall panels, all of which were identical, I wanted to stop. After I had finished, I was fairly proud, as at the time, it was probably one of the biggest sets I had ever built.</p>

<p>The wings on the glider have inspired a few interesting builds, and the stunt stick that holds the glider up has featured in many of my stop-motion movies, as it is one of the only one that I have. The Base itself has many flat tile pieces, something that is great when making&nbsp;anything requiring flat bricks. The central piece of th speeders are certainly interesting, but hard to do much with as they are pretty much exclusive to this set.</p>

<p>This set was certainly playable. Despite the simplicity of the rock-dropping mechanism on the glider, my little brother loves it. The Imperial walker has a nifty mechanism to make it&#39;s legs move as if it&#39;s walking, a helpful thing when acting out scenes. My favourite feature is the removable wall sections. In a movie or comic, these can easily be used to give the impression of the whole place blowing to pieces, without actually having to tear it apart!</p>

<p>The Ewoks are everybody&#39;s favourite&nbsp;Star Wars characters, and this set comes with three of them, which are all quite cute. The forest troopers are a relatively uncommon figure too, as well as the forest rebels. The set also comes with Han Solo, Leia, R2D2 and Chewbacca.</p>

<p>This was an enjoyable set to make movies with, and utilising&nbsp;many of the sloped and flat parts in my own builds was easy. The wings are also nice peices, and there are some nice minifigs. This set many not be the best, but it is certainly very good.</p>

"BrickFactoryINC","2021-10-26T04:40:11.157Z","one of the best original trilogy sets","<p>The Battle of Endor set is the only of its kind being very different from what we as LEGO Star Wars collectors are used to.&nbsp; The builds in the set were great the Bunker is big and does everything like the movie including blowing up (love that feature).&nbsp; The Ewok catapult and wing glider were good-looking additions for the accuracy of the scene.&nbsp; Even the AT-ST was great being the most iconic vehicle from that battle alone.&nbsp; The set even has a good plethora of minifigs specifically the best version of Endor Leia ever.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you love Return of The Jedi then you will love this looks good on display and plays well, with good minifigs to allow you to recreate the battle right there.&nbsp; This is a wish list item for every Star Wars fan</p>
