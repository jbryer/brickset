"sudorum","2009-07-11T19:51:11.53Z","A Majestic Sight to Behold","First off, this is not a disappointing set. If anything, it's the best Clone Wars set. The reasons? Great minifigures, featuring the first ever Palpatine and two blue troopers. <br>Its playability is also exceptional. Virtually the entire set can be dissected. The first half of the ship is Palpatine's control room, which contains a throne chair, a crate holding a miniature red death star hologram, and a control panel. The other half of the ship has a very efficient bomb dropping function, and a gun turret which can slide out from the side. Above the bomb function is an elevating hand hold which blends in quite well. Just behind the handle is a small cockpit which can slide out to access. The very rear of the ship has an escape pod similar to the Twilight one.  Believe it or not, this ship is smaller than the Imperial Star Destroyer, and only slightly longer than the Republic Gunship.

"timqua","2009-08-12T02:47:40.437Z","Good set","I was waiting for this set to come out for awhile. I was not disappointed despite some drawbacks.
The build was easy-going and kept me busy for a couple hours. 
The exterior of the ship is well detailed (the rear looks great) but the inside should have more rooms. There is senator palpatine's room which is nicely detailed, having his desk and a space to place the blue troopers and a prisoner or what have you. The anterior portion of the ship could have been made into a prison cell or private quarters. Instead, it houses a small safe to keep a small hologram piece of the deathstar. the back portion of the ship includes a single firing turret. It is nice how it slides from one side of the ship to the other, and once you lift the rear wings, a seated gunner clone can shoot at whatever. There is space in this area for more troopers, weapons, etc if you want to customize it.

The mid portion of the ship has a bomb-dropping device which works very well. This could have been used for an additional inside room, possibly a troop quarters? The handle to carry the ship is a great idea and fits into the shape of the ship excellently. The pilot cockpit is just okay, nothing special. Extra storage space under the cockpit holds an escape pod. There's nothing special about this space or pod either.

All in all, I like the ship and its functions. I would like to have seen more interior rooms or usable space but does not take away from the fact this is a good set. It is pricey at 100-120 depending on where you buy it, but I think it is worthy to add to a collection, especially if you want a large an impressive ship.

Senator palpatine's red outfit is cool, not as impressive as the blue troopers though. I would buy this set again if I had to.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lumix","2009-10-17T14:45:27.607Z","Not bad... but it could have been a bit better","I have made a complete, very detailed review here:
http://www.hispalug.com/foro/index.php?topic=7551.0

The review includes detailed photos both of the building process and the complete model, animated GIFs to show playability and also a video.

This Republic Attack Cruiser is a predeccesor to the Imperial-Class Star Destroyer, and as such, it's a dagger-shaped ship equipped with heavy-duty turbolasers and several hangars. This set is similar to 6211 - Imperial Star Destroyer. Both sets represent large starships with a playable interior and minifigs. Of course the exterior is not in the same scale as the interior.

The building process is pretty straight-forward. It starts with the base of the ship, then adding some interior, then the engines, the Technic frame and finally a lot of panels and the main wings. There are lots of plates and wings, small pieces to add some detail and some liftarms and Technic bricks to build the inner part of the Venator. It is a lenghty build overall (almost 1200 pieces) and a very interesting one, specially if you like Technic, like I do. You can see some photos of the building process here:
http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=385876

The finished model is pretty nice, and has the general shape of a Venator, but it's kind of ""fatty"", because all of the inner gadgets and interior room that they have included. You can see a comparison with the ""real"" ship here:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040141.jpg

As you can see, the model has many details and is well recreated, but it's ""fatter"" than the original one. Besides, there are some ""empty zones"" (or gaps) in the hull, pretty much like in 6211 - ISD. The Venator is quite smaller than 6211, which is a bit disappointing, as you can see here:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/Comparison-ISD/p1040112.jpg

http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/Comparison-ISD/p1040126.jpg

Anyway the Venator has almost 200 pieces less than the 6211 ISD, but it should be bigger than it really is. At least, this ship is more robust than 6211; The Venator's base is at least two-plates thick. The ship has a grip similar to 10195 LAAT/c so that you can hold it comfortably and/or swoosh it around. The grip is part of the ship hull when folded, a nice touch:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040155a.gif

This set includes five minifigs, three of which are exclusive: Senator Palpatine and two Senate Commands, as seen in some Clone Wars Episodes. The other two minifigs are a Clone Gunner and a Clone Pilot. Those 5 minifigs are OK, but the set could use some more. Senate Guards have standard clone heads under their helmets. Here's a close up view of them:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040167.jpg

You can open the front hood of the venator to access Palpatine's Chamber, as seen in this animated image:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040157a.gif

Palpatine's seat and desk are very well-designed, with some SNOT used here. Senate Commands stand next to him. There's plenty of room here to play:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040161a.gif

There is also a small room in front of Palpatine's Chamber with a storage box that can be extracted from the ship. Inside the box there's a Death Star prototype's hologram, another nice touch:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040196.jpg

There's an escape pod in the back of the ship that can be extracted easily by moving the rear panel. The escape pod can fit a minifig inside:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040184a.gif

The Venator's command bridge can be easily removed entirely to access the Clone Pilot:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040187.jpg

The upper and lower wings can be opened to gain access to the inner central part of the ship. Inside there's a turbolaser that can be moved to the left or right sides of the ship, and can twist 270ยบ aprox. The Clone Gunner is there. There are also two flick-misiles in the turbolaser:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040681a.gif

You can twist a Technic Axle in the middle-left of the ship to launch up to five bombs through the ventral hole of the ship, one by one:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040686.jpg

The whole bombing mechanism can be extracted from the ship to reload the bombs. Inside this mechanism, there are three yellow Technic Knobs that launch the bombs when you twist the Technic Axle.
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040690.jpg

So, the best part of the set is clearly it's great playability. It is also more robust than 6211. Anyway, 6211 is bigger, has more pieces, is more accurate to the original model, has more minifigs and it was cheaper when it was released, which makes hard for the Venator to be a ""must-have"" model. 8039 is not a bad set, but it could and should have been a bit better. The high playability compensates the other not-so-strong points of the set. Here's an animated GIF that shows all the gadgets this set has:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8039/p1040675a.gif

You can see the Venator's playability in this video:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTKVmBrXnTU

PROS
- Tons of playability.
- More robust than 6211, quite swoosheable.
- 3 exclusive minifigs.
- Has a grip to hold and swoosh it.
- Interesting bomb deploy mechanism.
- Iconic ""Clone Wars"" model.

CONS
- A bit ""fatty"".
- Not so accurate to the original model than other SW sets.
- Quite smaller than 6211.
- Pricey.
- There are some ""empty zones"" (gaps) in the hull (like in 6211 and many other SW sets).
- It should include more minifigs, or at least an exclusive one.
- Stickers, although there aren't many.

I recommend this set (but not highly recommend it). It has some flaws, but it's pretty cool, nice warship. I whish they released an UCS version. Full photo gallery here:

First off the Mini figures are awesome mainly the two senate commando and ofcourse Chancellor Palpatine. I love the color or the senate commando as well as the sleak new helmet design. Now lets move on to the ship itself, this ship is massive and would need both hands to play with. I guess depending on built, ship maybe flimsy or will hold properly for playability. I saw a video review of this before I opened mine, and this young lad kept complaining of how the ship needs room and it's not proportion with the movie ship. Ofcourse it's not proportions, it's lego. In the end of his review he dropped the whole ship and was annoyed. I just could not get some people who want more room for a ship like this which would mean bigger design and higher price.

Design of the ship is fantastic, nothing less from the lego designers. Here are some pro's and con's. Biggest pro's for me is I got this set for only $79.00, could not even believe it myself.

Pro's
- Massive Ship
- Collectible Mini Figures
- Escape Pod
- Hidden Gunner
- Bomb Dropping mechanism
- Death Star Plans

1) Nice break from the original trilogy ship, but I can still see the resemblance.

4) Good for modifying, (I made my twin commnad towers one command tower, so it can be used with the Home One as the bridge.) 

CONS
1) One wing cannon? What if you're attacked on BOTH sides at once? Not  a very good design there anyway.

"chavez247","2009-12-29T11:12:16.733Z","A Pretty Good Set","This is a pretty good set. It is very big, with great minifigures; Palpatine, 2 Senate Commandos, a clone gunner and a clone pilot. Palpatine and the Senate Commandos are totally new figures, and the gunner and pilot are fairly rare.
The set itself is very impressive; it is big and radiates power. It has lots of guns and a nice color scheme.
While building the set, you must be very careful, and you must connect everything very securely, particularly the plates on the bottom. The middle and base are a bit technic, but after that, you simply add the details and the covers. However, one thing that happens to me often is that when I try to pick it up by the handle, it always separates the top from the bottom. Now, I have to hold it on the bottom which stops me from dropping the bombs.
It is a nice, big set, but is difficult to play with. Really, the only thing you can do are slow space battles or bombing missions on the ground. Or you can use it to scare the enemy and land impressively. But one thing that is disappointing is that it can`t hold many clones. If you take out Palpatine`s desk and chair, it can hold about seven counting the pilot and gunner. The rest of the set is tight, covered enclosed spaces.
Overall, this is a pretty good set. It has good minifigures and it looks great. Despite a few flaws, it still is a must have for any Star Wars fan. I hope you found my review helpful.

Pros:
1. Beautiful detail, even though small
2. Gunner's seat is like a close-up for a space battle (This is like my LEGO Star Wars Battlefront)
3. Though I think the office is not really a good room for this starship, it is pretty neat, especially the design of the chair and desk.
4. If you are a clone lover, get ready to love the Senate Guards! Though they do have clone heads under those amazingly detailed helmets...
5. The engines are very detailed, which is why I really like this set.

Cons:
1. *sigh, when opening the front, sometimes the top breaks off. This is annoying.
2. SO SMALL! I made a cruiser that is seen in Clone Wars: Season 2. It rocks, minifig scale, but too big compared to this ship because of IT'S TINY SIZE! But can't really fix that.

"EtudeTheBadger","2010-03-31T16:30:24.547Z","Space Predator","<p>I just got this ship today, and am writing this review literally about an hour after finishing it. The Venator-class Star Destroyer is, in no small way, AWESOME.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I want to spend this review talking objectively. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build will take you <span style=""font-style: italic"">A WHILE</span>. Trust me, I've been toiling for about four hours on the ship. If you want a long, drawn-out building session, this is for you. The detail in the set is good, with a Chancellor's Office, missile hold, bridge and gunnery bay. That's four rooms, an up on the three in the Imperial model.</p>
<p>If you built the Imperial model, there's more of the same in some areas, especially concerning the hull plates. There is a ton of functionality in the ship, with missiles and torpedoes to fire and detonate. I especially like the engines- they're laid out with some real precision. There's a reference in <span style=""font-style: italic"">Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader </span>to the fact that maybe Imperial Destroyers don't have the artistry that goes into a Venator - or Acclamator - and I'd have to agree! I have to hand it to this set on the subject of design. There are also the correct number of guns- four on each side of the bridge, rather than the incorrect two-to-a-side on the Imperial one.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some glaring drawbacks in the model, though, and they're ones I cannot ignore. The extortionate price is a con and a half- even at ยฃ95 this is <span style=""font-style: italic"">way</span> more expensive than the Imperial model- and the Venator is <span style=""font-style: italic"">smaller</span>. The mind boggles. Figures- <span style=""font-style: italic"">where</span>? Yes, the set has the first ever Chancellor Palpatine figure, but only four clones? Ahem. The Imperial one had 9 figures (including mouse droid). Where are the <span style=""font-style: italic"">droids</span>, LEGO? In a scene during Episode III, I counted four astromechs on the deck of a Venator. Surely an R2 unit wouldn't go amiss? The spaces on the ship are regrettably used, too. Half the ship is <span style=""font-style: italic"">office</span>.</p>
<p>maaboo35's Note: I left out the Chancellor's office. Rather, I'm going to use the space as a flight deck. Maybe even a sliding lock in the floor panel area. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, the spaces are fully customizable with the right parts, and I do admire the overall design, as well as an opportunity to expand my clone collection and acquire the admittedly cool Senate Guards.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Great design</li>
    <li>Takes ages to make</li>
    <li>Some space for potential</li>
    <li>Mechanisms show effort</li>
    <li>Guns look excellent- lock and <span style=""font-style: italic"">load</span>!</li>
    <li>Good size- in scale with the Imperial model</li>
    <li>Great for dioramas and battles<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Very little amount of figures<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Price is up somewhere in the rafters</li>
    <li>No Admiral Yularen figure</li>
    <li>No droids</li>
    <li>Ill use of space</li>
    <li>Escape pod is useless<br>

<p>When I finished building this thing, it was by far the best set I bought that day, better than the turbo tank, and everything else. It totally passed my expectations and the finished product was massive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE MINIFIGURES:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get a really ugly looking chancellor palpatine, which is okay, but kind of wierd looking.</p>
<p>The two senate commandoes are awesome, with special helmets, but clone faces inside.</p>
<p>You get a clone gunner operating the cannon, which is pretty cool, you can never have enough clone gunners.</p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, you get a clone pilot, which is pretty rare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE BUILD:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was awesome, lots of pieces, and it comes together really well. It took me a few hours, but I'm a fast builder! First you build the bottom piece, then the engines, then the main structure, and finally the two bridge towers and the armour plates. When you first build the bottom plate, it doesn't seem very big, but the engines and the nose protrude out quite a bit, so the finished model is bigger than you'd expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLAYABILITY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is pretty playable. There is a gunner who slides out of either side and has a big cannon (like an SPHA/T,&nbsp;I think). There is also a little knob on the side that you can turn, and bombs drob out. You can also slide the bomb mechanism out to reload it (there are five bombs total). I'm not so sure about the Chancellor's office, because it doesn't make good use of the space, and&nbsp;it's supposed to be in the senate building anyway. Instead, you could easily modify it to fit in a troop deck or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value for the money is good (for nowadays anyway). You get 1170 pieces and 5 minifigs for $120 US which is almost 10 cents per piece. Unfortunately in Canada (where I live) it costs $150, which is ridiculous. But luckily I bought it when I went to California.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is an awesome set, and if you have the cash, you should definitely get it over anything else.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,4

The pieces are great, but it is impossible to play with. If you are going to put it on display, it may be a great set, but if you are going to play with it, dont get it. So I wouldnt get it.

<p>So as a recent returning AFOL, this one only one a few sets I've bought.
 I was surprised that the core of the ship is all (what I consider 
anyway) Technic LEGO bricks.<br>

Fun and awesome ship, very large. The handle to pick up and carry it around is really nice, and hides well.<br>

Its features include a small bridge, a bomb compartment that can release them, four small turrets on both sides, opening front that reveals the Chancellor's chamber, and a large turret with flick-fire missiles that is maned by the Clone Gunner.

"Toa_of_Protodermis","2012-01-19T19:18:25.33Z","One of the best sets i've ever seen","I'm not a big fan of writing huge reviews, so i'll try to get to the point as quickly as possible. Venator has a great value for money if one could still find it for a standard price. If You consider getting it, better do it sooner than later, cause it's price is getting higher every day. Building is fun, a bit repetitive, as with all symmetrical structures. However, it's not noticable with so many pieces. AFOL will find the building experience challenging, kids will have fun with lots of playability it posseses. The only thing I don't like about this set is that cancellors senate room in the center of the ship. There was no such a place in the movie counterpart. That's the only reason for 4 points for playability instead of giving it 5. As for the value for money part, the set has got a really nice price per piece ratio, but it still is expensive. Overall I strongly recommend this set to every fan of Lego, and I give it my personal quality mark.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4

<p>The box is a cardboard structure in which you find plastic bags containing the pieces you need to build the set on the front of the box. The instructions are located in the box and provide you with the correct way to build the set pictured on the front of the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<div>The parts are quite basic but they are used in a very clever way to get the exact look of the real thing.</div>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I love the chancellor palpatine minifigure but the others are not as good. I don&#39;t think that there is not much more to say on this subject.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is not that quick but it is still relatively easy. It took me about 3 or 4 hours of building nonstop to complete the model.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great on your shelf and I would definitely recommend this product to any sane person! In other words, buy it!!!</p>

"apcsb","2016-10-24T10:07:39.36Z","Mod it or leave it (Adult perspective)","<p>Considering that there&#39;s tons of video reviews on YouTube, I&#39;d rather focus on what can be improved here.</p>

<p><b>What&#39;s done well</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s a Venator and&nbsp;it&#39;s big! Looks great next to 75055 ISD. Not to great next to 7964 Republic Frigate / 7665 Cruiser, but I find those lacklustre.</li>
	<li>Nice sturdy frame with a well-balanced and nicely integrated handle.</li>
	<li>Liked the escate pod as a play feature.</li>
	<li>The build is great, even though there is a lot of panels to assemble, it&#39;s not boring and teaches techniques such as angling using swiwel hinges, pins, click hinges and technic elements,&nbsp;bracing, rigidity etc.</li>
	<li>Also, some amusing techniques on locking the bomb bay and the cockpit in place</li>
	<li>Good texturing on top - not too much, not too little.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What needs improved</strong></p>

<p>Ok, now to the critique and potential improvements. I have yet to implement most of those, so no pics (yet). There are three main areas: play features, resulting model looks, design inconsistensies and compromises. I understand that it&#39;s no USC set, and that 75055 came much later, but anyways. With RRP of EUR140 it&#39;s half-UCS, so I think we can expect some quality.</p>

<p><strong>Play features</strong></p>

<p>From the AFOL perspective, the play features are dubious (that&#39;s a polite way of saying &quot;rubbish&quot;).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Who needs the huge room with cartoonsh (what&#39;s wrong with the faces) Palpatine when one could have troop/fighter bay?
	<ul>
		<li>MOD: Get rid of the throne room, the &quot;carpet&quot; tile and create a bay with tons of microscale fighters.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Same with cannon: it&#39;s huge, occupies tons of space, moves on rails that are attached to PLATES, not bricks --&gt; over time there will be&nbsp;distortion, squeaky sounds and scratches on the tiles. In addition, being so huge it fires two puny flick missiles! AND you have to tear open half of the ship for that..&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>[MOD] Either make the cannon fire spring shooters/6-barrel stud shooters/large technic missile or better get rid of that atrocity altogether.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The bombing&nbsp;feature is kinda cool, but takes way too much space and has a handle too long.
	<ul>
		<li>[MOD] Make a more compact bay with a discreet sliding/swiweling bay door - there is just enough space on the bottom for a couple hinges.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design impact</strong></p>

<p>Now, because of all these play features that require lots of vertical space, the entire model is FAT. And because of this, the gaps and odd angles between panels are evident, making the entire thing ugly from any view except from the top and the one on the promi pics&nbsp;(I imagine LEGO photographers took quite a lot of time to fine that one angle :) ). Any other view that has side surfaces is outright bad.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The sides of the from section simply have exposed technic beams and bracing.</li>
	<li>The rear of the front section has huge gaps on top and on bottom</li>
	<li>The removable bomb bay / docking section panels do no align with &nbsp;the rear of the front section</li>
	<li>The side panes at the front of the &quot;wings&quot; (where the stripes are) have a gap that is ~1.5brick tall between the panel and the bottom section.</li>
	<li>The front section is ~1brick higher than the mid-section and has a gap (to allow it to open wide) that spoils the otherwise smooth top view</li>
	<li>The large gap between the reat top panels (where the turrets are) and the bridge)</li>
	<li>The rear view is more or less OK, except that the engines are inaccurate and there is a panel warping issue (read below)</li>
</ul>

<p>[MOD] I am seriously considering throwing all the play features out and reducing the height of this thing by 1-3 bricks to make it more in line with the original and filling all the gaps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[MOD] Free up the internal space in the middle and make either a fighter launch bay or move the escape pod there (or both).</p>

<p>[MOD] At least cover the front side panels with something so they don&#39;t look so exposed</p>

<p>Another major gripe is the bridge. The entire bridge is just two plate-built panels on their side - there are no bricks inside. This on one sde allowed to cleverly hide the cockpit, the handle and the escape pod. AND make the whole thing cheaper&nbsp;However, we know that the big plate-built panels tend to warp, unless they have bricks attached to them. So the tail end (where the escape pod hatch is) almost always looks as if the pod had already exploded inside and blew the covers in different directions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[MOD] Since I am not interested in the cockpit&nbsp;(which is too primitive anyway) I am planning to make more appropriately-looking brick-built bridge that will also look good when the handle is extended. Also considering actually integrating handle with the two command decks, but seems like it will require adding extra weight&nbsp;to the rear of the ship. Making brick-built superstructure will also cover the gap between it and the &quot;turret-bearing panels&quot; (which should also be easier if the ship is thinner and the andge of the turret-bearing panel is not that steep). It should be possible to easily add&nbsp;a couple of spring shooters like in 75055.</p>

<p><strong>Other</strong></p>

<p>[MOD] I would prefer more accurate engines.Just compare to the original. Here&#39;s a good view:&nbsp;http://exoticctofu.deviantart.com/art/Venator-class-Star-Destroyer-344638777. Fortunately, this can be easily addressed.</p>

<p>[MOD] Make the side guns rotate at least a little. They make totally no sense!</p>

<p>[MOD] Consider adding a large technic/Bionicle missile right where the nose is.</p>

<p>All of these mods (except for thinning out the whole ship) should be realively easy to implement and should not require any rare or specialized parts. Once/when I&#39;m done I&#39;ll see if I can edit this review with pics and links.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>If you&#39;re 10 - you&#39;ll love it. It&#39;s Huge and Red!</li>
	<li>If you&#39;re UCS lover or like realistic models - this is not for you. Instead&nbsp;go to YouTube and search for &quot;UCS Venator MOC&quot;. You&#39;ll love that one!</li>
	<li>If you pedantinc just like me, you are planning to discplay it and not play with it - don&#39;t go for it. It&#39;s a sore.</li>
	<li>If you&#39;re pedantic just like me&nbsp;and you&#39;re up for a MOC/MOD challenge, but not to the UCS level - it will keep you occupied and I hope these ideas will provide a starting ground!</li>
