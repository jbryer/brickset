<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>the box is small. it shows another build in the back. one instruction book.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>WHY IS THERE A PIECE OF PAPER AS A PART!?!??! anyways, there are 6 pieces in the set.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>this minifigure is the one of its kind. nothing to take off. not even his torso, pants head etc.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>#2EASY4ME . the whole build just takes a few minutes, maybe even seconds! is that small!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>looked ok. nothing else to say.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>this set is BAD. i mean seriously. USING A PIECE OF PAPER ON A LEGO SET?!?! plus the minifigure is crap. overall, DON&#39;T BUY THIS SET.</p>
