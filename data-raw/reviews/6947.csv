This game was just the most weird and boring game i've ever played.

Pros:
- there are some special abilities in the game.

Cons:
- there is a very short time period to use the special abilities.
- I couldn't finish level 1 because the special ability time period was over before I could do the things i had to do...

overall just a very stupid game and a real big mistake...
DON'T BUY IT!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
