The speeder in the back is really cool and looks very movie accurate. Of course though we could always use more magnaguards. Count Dooku looks really cool and has a chrome lightsaber like the origanal. The pilot droid looks very lame though. The biggest con though is that it so extremely overpriced. In my opinion, this is the most extremely overpriced clone wars set since the Republic Gunship. I mean come on, 60 dollars for something that is as long as the magnaguard starfighter!

Pros:
Count Dooku
more magnaguards
Very movie accurate
Nice speeder

Cons:
pilot droid ""sigh""
Way to small
flick fire missiles are hard to shoot
Box art show the ship backwards!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zrath","2009-01-26T16:56:39.92Z","Pricey, weird, and incomplete","Another wacky Geonosian design (remember the 4778 Geonosian Fighter), this set is made up of modules plugged in every which way.
My biggest disappointment with this set is that it's incomplete, especially in the rear, and doesn't even come close to being a sealed design. Those clamshells in the back don't close flush, there's a 2-stud open gap.
I added 18 of my own parts to make the ship more presentable: 12 1x4 smooth plates in brown, and 6 assorted sloped pieces to fill the gap in the clamshells in back.
I'm probably going to redesign the ship a bit to be fully sealed.
The pilot droid is completely off. The ""real"" one is very short and has wheels. This one has legs and is too tall.
 
Pros:
Unusual Geonosian design
24 brown 2x4 sloped pieces
New cartoon Dooku looks great
Both hair and hood for Dooku
Looks close enough to the ""real"" thing
 
Cons:
Expensive
Incomplete with large gaps
Dooku's cape gets munched by the clamshells' bases
Laughably small cockpit
Pilot droid is wrong
Difficult and flimsy build, though okay once assembled
Shoulda been a teeny bit bigger
 
So, it's not a bad set per se but it does have issues.
I like the Geonosian ships, so I had to get it.

"Deinonychus","2009-01-29T17:12:15.293Z","Separatist Extravagance","$60 US for 385 pieces. I wanted to feel one of two ways about this set, I wanted to love it so that the price worth it, or I wanted to hate it so I could then go on the Internet and just heap abuse all over it. Fact is, after putting it together, I neither love it nor hate it. 

The Minifigs are decent. The FA-4 Pilot Droid is nothing special, but I like the creative use of a skeleton leg for the head. That’s the kind of “part used in an unusual way” thing I love to see in any LEGO creation. The new Dooku is pretty well done and his unique hairpiece looks great. His speeder is a little closer to the movie version than the original speeder set, and fits snugly into the rear of the ship.

The ship is pretty cleanly designed and easy to build. Composed of quite a few larger pieces and bricks and not too many obnoxious small parts, it has a nice hefty feel when assembled. He set does have quite a few stickers to apply, which my turn of quite a few builders. It looks nice sitting on the shelf, a sturdy combination of supporting bricks and fake landing gear give it an interesting upward tilt. Thankfully, the flick-fire missile mechanism isn’t prone to misfires. The cowlings that open up for solar sail deployment open straight up and down, and don’t seem to be at the correct angles or orientation to match the look of the actual vehicle. It looks more like a hungry bird trying to eat a Christmas tree ornament. 

The lack of solar sails is no great loss. Stowage and keeping them from tangling would be a nightmare, not to mention displaying them properly. LEGO made a smart move not even attempting to include them. If you REALLY want them that badly, it’d be easy enough to create some.

In the end, it’s an okay set. It isn’t quite as spectacular or interesting as most other Star Wars vehicles, and there’s not too much about it that makes you want to play with it. I can really only recommend this set to hard-core collectors or completists, and even then I’d advise waiting for a sale or deal. I myself would have probably passed on it until much later had I not had a 20% coupon to use.

"David1971","2009-02-08T09:58:21.607Z","Unusual and amazing!","This is a really brilliant set, I absolutely love it. It looks so ununsual and, with its wings open, rather beautiful. It's like some kind of crab or lobster ... in a good way! To appreciate the set, don't look at the pictures like the one above with the wings folded in ... to see what it looks like properly, look at the picture on the front of the box (as seen in 'more views' if you look at this set on the Lego Shop website).

I wasn't sure at the start: Before buying it, I thought it was crazy to have a solar sailer without a solar sail, but then I decided to forgive it, and thought it looked like a nice pod anyway. (And let's face it, if you got a big piece of cloth or foil in the box, it would be rubbish and you couldn't really use it).
 
And then, opening the box, the number of pieces compared to the UK £39 price tag seemed rather unsettling even though I already *know* that these Clone Wars sets are all priced at least 30 per cent more than what we think they 'should' be.

But then I built it, and it's really quite amazing. It ends up rather big, and very sturdy. It's an extraordinary design, quite unlike the 'cockpit with wings' that is most ships.

One you've made it, the price doesn't seem too bad. Even as an unlicensed set it would be £35, probably, so £39 is fine really (and, to be honest, there's never been an unlicensed set this good).

The design is great -- it's not merely Studs Not On Top (SNOT), it's Studs Facing Out In All Directions (that's, er, SFOIAD!)

You also get a good lot of unusual parts and colours. It's a shame you only get one 'proper' minifig, Count Dooku (very nicely done). Personally i don't really count robots as proper minifigs, so it's far less good value than, say, the X-Wing which comes with *five* minifigs (and R2D2 as well).

There are a couple of problems. The landing gear is flimsy; and having a whole 'hidden' thing is always good but why don't the doors close over the speeder bike? (Easily fixed with a few extra pieces). And finally, although this must be part of the original Lucasfilm design, the whole thing seems to me to be sideways, i.e. when the wings are open and it's like a big lobster, it's actually on it side. You would barely know except that the pilot and speeder bike, and landing gear, are on their side when it's that way round. But that doesn't really matter.

Overall, really cool and excellent.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"newlegoset333","2009-01-28T17:13:55.577Z","Not too bad...pretty cool","I got this off of ebay, very odd set, quite pricey, but when you look at the ship alone, and the speeder it's very cool.

Pros:

Very big when finished.
Cool speeder.
Trans-purple auto-fire flick missiles.
Landing gear
Complex Build, but not too confusing.
Chrome silver curved lightsaber hilt.

Cons:

As everyone has already said, price.
Very ugly Dooku. (In my opinion.)
FA-4 Pilot droid shouldn't have legs.
Big gaping hole in the back. (I fixed it with my own pieces.)
No sail
Sail pieces open weirdly.

Overall, it's pretty good. Hard to find, and possibly very pricey, but all of the other cons you can fix with a little imagination, and possibly some construction paper and string if you want the sail.

"yodaccm","2009-02-02T20:33:29.717Z","An Interesting Set...","When I saw this set at the local Lego outlet, I had to pick it up.  As i perused the box checking out all of the features included with this set, I saw the ghastly $55 price tag.  Then I checked the piece count and saw that it was around 380 pieces.  Then I checked the price again and shook my head.  Lego Star Wars is getting expensive!

I asked the clerk if prices were going up and he said yes, but especially with the licensed Legos, e.g.:  Star Wars, Indiana Jones, etc.  Got to pay those royalties to the ""Flanneled One"".  Oh well.  On the review.

Is this set worth $55?  It is debatable.  The Solar Sailer is an interesting pick for a Lego model.  A strange design, this ship was first seen in Attack of the Clones, taking off from Geonosis after the tumultous battle that began the Clone Wars.  As it shot into space, a wonderfully amazing sail unfurled itself from the ship and I guess propelled the craft through space, harnessing the solar ""winds"" of the local stars.  A weird and wonderful addition to the Star Wars universe.

Does it translate well to a Lego set?  Not really and that is why the actual ""sail"" of the Solar Sailer is not surprisingly absent.  I'm not sure how they would have pulled it off, to be honest, and I'm sure they probably threw around a few ideas.  So basically what you get is the core of the ship without the actual propulsion system.  That's what is weird.  Seems like they should have just scrapped the idea and included the new Dooku figure in the forth coming ""Seperatist Shuttle"".

Nonetheless, you do get some nice features:
The ship has a cockpit to fit the pilot droid, and a compartment to stow Dooku's little speeder, and the Count himself if he is already riding it
There are four ""flaps"" at the front of the ship where the ""sail"" is to emerge.  They only move up and down, which is kind of weird, giving the ship the look of a peeled brown banana more than anything when it is flying
2 dual firing ""flick fire missle"" mechanisims
Landing gear
new Dooku figure with new torso, face and hair.  His silver hilted lightsaber is curved like in the movie so that is a nice accurate touch
2 Magna guards, not much to say here, they're pretty cool
pilot droid, rather nondescript droid, nothing much to add

Cons:
Stickers, though they add depth to the rather monotonous brown color scheme
No place for the Magna Guards to sit
Price is jut obscene

"wyoeaglefan","2009-03-02T10:51:36.357Z","Mediocre set, nice to see another Dooku though","This set is surprisingly larger than what first glance would hint to. They also actually included a true chrome lightsaber hilt for Dooku which is nice. The set is also not sealed very well so I pulled out the old collection and made a few modifications to the rear. The price is very steep, judging from this set Lego apparently came up with the price by the size of the ship not the piece count. Even on sale at TRU.com for 47.99 it seemed a bit much. On to pros and cons

Pros- 
Chrome hilt for Dooku
Dooku
2 magna guards

First, if this set is called a Solar Sailer, where are the sails in this set? No wait, there's none. Second, although this is for the Clone Wars sets, I dislike the Dooku minifig alot. He looks like a Greek god and not a Sith Lord. Lego should have put the Dooku minifig from the Jedi Duel set into this set and there would be nothing wrong with Dooku. Finally, why did Lego wait SEVEN years after Attack of the Clones to make this set? This set should have been made in 2002 or 2003 and not in 2009!

"THX_1138","2009-03-07T15:54:10.077Z","Surprisingly awesome!","This set is quite awesome, despite being possibly the worst deal in LSW history in terms of price/parts. My views on the set may be different though as I got it for $47.99. Many people seem to be unhappy about the lack of a sail, but I am happy about this. If TLC had given it one, it would probably not have worked well, have been ugly and/or too small, awkward, and would have made the set even more expensive.
Pros:
-The Solar Sailer is a very cool vehicle. It's a lot bigger than I expected. 
-Two rare Magnaguards.
-New Count Dooku with an awesome hairpiece.
-The skeleton foot/leg as the head of the pilot droid is creative.
-The speeder is pretty cool.
-The landing gear works well.
Cons:
-At it's normal price it would be a bit overpriced.
-It has stickers (I don't care but some do).
-There is no interior at all (I changed this, though it wasn't exactly easy).

"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-04-10T22:34:31.247Z","Count Dooku's Solar Sailer","I just got this set today, and after bringing it home seeing that my first pick up of the set from my Toys 'R' Us was resealed but someone picked thru the figs and returned the set, I exchanged that one for a REAL non-opened set. After that little incident I was able to see the whole set as it really was. The Count Dooku Solar Sailer is as we all know from Episode II and the Clone Wars but without the sail, which isn't a bad thing because how could they fit a sail in and make it look like a nice model and two, in the TV series it isn't show using the sail. This set is very ingeniously designed, and is so cleverly built. There are 4 hidden flick fire missles which are shot in pairs of two by an awesome firing mechanism, also a cool cockpit design where the pilot seat comes out, nice landing gear which works well, and Dooku's speeder, which stores in the back of the ship. The back is also one of the best features, as it fits 6 in the back with the removal of the speeder (which is why I got it--for a troop transport for my army). This set is fairly sturdy but the panels covering the flick firing mechanism are very weak and are prone to come off and that can result in a fairly large scale repair if you are kinda clumsy like me.

"Brickman193","2009-10-19T02:34:49Z","The Sleek Sith Sailer","This set really is a LEGO rendition of a glass cannon. It looks awesome, and has a pretty unique build, but it is super fragile and not the sturdiest of recent Clone Wars LEGO sets like 8019. Still, the awesome minifigs and abundance of tan pieces make the set a good one for collectors. It is pricey ($115 AU), and an exclusive to TRU, but well worth the expense. After all, what LEGO isn't expensive these days?

MINIFIGS
The real draw here is Count Dooku (Darth Tyranus) in his first and so far only Clone Wars appearance. The Count comes with his standard cape and hood, but stands out with his interesting new hairpiece and curved lightsabre. The lightsabre here is not matte like the new Jedi hilts, but I guess it owes to the Count's arrogancy that he would possess a shiny hilt.
The Magnaguards are also a welcome bonus, and seeing how you get two, I assume they are Dooku's personal guard. They come with special tattered capes, awesome staffs and special new heads. Their construction is a bit more intricate then the normal battle droid, so that's a plus.
The last minifig here is the pilot droid. I noticed that a lot of other reviews were upset with the pilot droid, but when you have a ship so awesome looking no one should really care about the pilot. I don't mind him, but if you have a spare battle droid then you can replace him. 5/5

SOLAR SAILER
This ship is long-awaited, as it is a beautiful, unique vehicle amongst the mas-produced battle fleets of the Clone Wars. The Sailer in ATOC had a massive shimmery sail, hence the name, but for logistical reasons I guess this set functions better without. I don't have an issue with it, but if you like movie accuracy it might be a negative.
The ship itself is separated into several, small sections, with each section being put together at the end. This means that the ship has studs on the bottom, top and sides, but it also means that the ship if fragile. Good for display, but for ""swooshing"" or playing I'd recommend something smaller or sturdier. The ship also features the typical flick-fire missiles.
When finished, the ship's long arms on both the top and bottom can reach outwards, giving the ship an intimidating presence - much like its owner, the Count. 4/5

DOOKU'S SPEEDER
For stylish land transport, the Sailer comes with a small one man speeder. The speeder is brilliantly designed, being quite an improvement over the first design, colourwise and structure-wise. It slides into the back of the glider, leaving a gap that annoys several other reviewers. But that's what modding is for, eh? 5/5

STICKERS
Just a few grey stripes and spots for the outside hull. They look nice, but if you REALLY hate them, I'm sure that the ship looks nice without them.

Hold and behold, ship was really awesome, it was actually bigger than what I have expected. Build was quite unique and the actual process of building it was very enjoyable. Minifigures are collectible as well, Magna Guards are great, but no space in the ship to go in. Count Dooku's is something worth having, specially with the extra hood to change into. It's very hard to sit him properly on his speeder though as his cape pushes back on the back side of the speeder. Love how the speeder goes into the rear end of the solar sailer, just didn't like the gap on the two gray panel that close on both sides. All in all the design of the ship is pretty spectacular and can be swooshed back and forth as both ends of the ship looks like it is the front. Would have been great in my opinion if they made an extra middle opening arm for the sailer rather than opening them unequally as depicted on the picture, coz if you would swoosh it it doesnt look right when either the left side or the right side is opened wider and unequally. The Droid pilot is alright but a better head would have made it better, I guess they just used a skeloton head for it. Color combination for the ship is nothing less than awesome, as the landing gear also is very unique. Here are Pro's and Con's for you:

Pro's
- Magna Guard are a great addition
- Hair piece as well as hood are fantastic
- Unique design of ship as well as how speeder goes in the back
- Ship is actually big and swooshability is great

Con's
- No space for Magna Guards in the ship
- Pilot Droid has a skeleton leg
- Cape gets in the way when Dooku sits on the speeder
- Closing panel on the back has a gap, and you can actually see Dooku inside with his speeder.

Other than these I say get this ship as it is an awesome piece, not as accurate as the one in the movie but this set is a must have.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Diska","2010-07-02T14:53:00.707Z","Very Cool","I bought this set at a local TRU, as it is a TRU/Lego.com exclusive. Price was about $60. It's just a tad too much, I'd be much happier with $50 or even $55 for it, but at least it is a good quality set.&nbsp;This set is a bit better for display than for play as well.&nbsp;I was really struck by how unique of a model it is, just the way it's designed is very different than most sets. I also really like the ship's colors. They are a nice blend and I don't think those colors are easy to find elsewhere. Dooku's new speeder is great, I love the design and color too. The minifigs are all really good except for the one with a skeleton leg for its head, but at least you don't see that much since it's in the cockpit most of the time. Dooku (Clone Wars version) is exclusive to this set, and the Magna Guards are hard to find. I do like this set quite a bit and am satisfied with my purchase, and I can't see why so many people dislike this set so much.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div>-Dooku in Clone Wars style is great(and exclusive)! One of the cooler minifigs from the Clone Wars in my opinion. (You get an extra cape for him, so go use it on some other figure!)</div><div>-Magna Guards are very cool and rare</div><div>-Dooku's speeder is also a nice, smooth look and feel</div><div>-Spaceship is a unique design and good color</div><div>-Hidden cargo bay on the Solar Sailer for Dooku's speeder</div><div>-Flaps/Wings are open/close and adjustable, so they look good</div><div>-Overall, parts are very good and lots of them</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:<br>-For those who care, the Spaceship doesn't have the sail, but for me that's no problem since it would have made it cost way more</div><div>-Pilot Droid is stupid, but at least it's got white parts so you can use if for other figs like Grievous</div><div>-Cockpit is small, forcing you to put Dooku on his speeder to have him fit in the ship</div><div>-As you can see from the picture, the spaceship only looks good when going backwards if the flaps are out. Oh, well, they could be cool air brakes if you're facing the right way. :)</div><div>-A little costly</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, I give this a 4.5/5.

"thechabear","2015-05-27T03:22:04.063Z","it runs on the sun right?","<p>Hello everyone and welcome to the chabear brickset&nbsp;channel. Today we will review the count dooku&#39;s&nbsp;solar sailer. This will be coming to my youtube channel very soon. Anyway this is exclusive to toys r us in 2009. It says it&#39;s limed edition on the box but it should be marked as exclusive in my opinion. So lets get into the review.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is wide and tall. But thin. On the back it advertises the other 2009 sets for star wars and it also shows the features of it. The instructions remind me of the rouge shadow instructions. On the back it advertises the star wars sets again and some other 2009 sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts that stand out to me are:</p>

<p>count dooku&#39;s lightsaber&nbsp;hilt</p>

<p>tie fighter&nbsp;windows but in gray</p>

<p>purple tipped missiles</p>

<p>minifg&nbsp;parts</p>

<p>Those are the only parts that I think are really good and worth to&nbsp;you</p>

<h3>Minifigures-4</h3>

<p>COUNT DOOKU (CLONE WARS): This minifig was exclusive until 2012. He first appeared in this set and he also appears in the malevolence. &nbsp;The gray hair piece is really rare now and looks nice. His torso does not have that much printing and he doesn&#39;t have back printing. He has common rare black feet and a brown cape to complete the sith fashion. He wields&nbsp;his curved lightsaber which is exclusive to the count dooku minfigs. He also can switch his hair for a brown hoodie. Overall the best minifig in the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/legostarwars/images/5/54/Count_Dooku_(C.W).jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111219185238"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PILOT DROID- This is the 1st time that we have ever gotten a pilot droid minifig but it will reappear in 2013. &nbsp;It has a skeleton leg for a head and battle droid parts for the body. Overall: the only exclusive minifig and a weak one</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/legostarwarsminifigure/images/0/05/Pilot_droid.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130723192629"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MAGNA GUARD X2- Well we have to get a casual not wanted figure in this set but I think it is wanted. The magna guard only appears in the magna guard starfighter and this set. Both sets you get 2 in. These are really nice minifigs. A nice molded head with a nice cape. The rest are standard battle droid bodies with some cockpit hitches and claws. They have the electro staff which has the purple tipped missile parts. Overall: Nice minifigs indeed</p>

<h3>The building experience</h3>

<p>Took me about 30 minutes to complete. A lot of receptive builds with some nice ones to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>SPEEDER BIKE: Every set with count dooku in it must include his famous speeder bike except for the marvelence. This is the 2nd out of 3 versions. It&#39;s not that good but it can fit count dooku&nbsp;and it can hold his lightsaber which is good. A little bit of stickers on it but a good mini build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.brickwars-sets.com/brickwars-sets_pictures/more_views/LEGO_7752_PIC_3.JPG"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SOLAR SHIP: The ship itself is in the middle of all of the star wars clone wars ships. It&#39;s a okay ship but here is some flaws.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t fit count dooku inside without putting him on his bike.</p>

<p>the tie fighter windows fall off a lot.</p>

<p>loads of good printing wasted because of stickers.</p>

<p>makes the droid sit in a awkward potion</p>

<p>the landing gear trips a lot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>now here are some pros</p>

<p>technic build is really nice</p>

<p>pilot droid is easy to take out</p>

<p>speeder can fit in the ship</p>

<p>Yea so loads of cons. But if you look at it, it looks just like the ship from the tv series. Compare down bellow&nbsp;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PILOT DROID SPEEDER?: If this is really a mini speeder for the pilot droid. I am going to cry. The cockpit can come out and on the box it shows it flying away. Really lego really. It doesn&#39;t even have a engine.</p>

<p><img src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/ca/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=f0f541ba6e&amp;view=fimg&amp;th=14d932d15dbe7d0f&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=emb&amp;realattid=ii_ia64kv3b1_14d932c58d0273df&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ_qHA4sBd-m-3djJOUh1kQcpLlsCnoA8tnBJzRIQWvJ7OEtx6wt2qN5gLt6O51TdwtPe8Jnz9x4-LvQX1Z_cej6cV-Bb8GpSqwGpmxiXOIab4y-_q_co7lZ3zQ&amp;sz=s0-l75-ft&amp;ats=1432693315852&amp;rm=14d932d15dbe7d0f&amp;zw&amp;atsh=1"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A cool set but a little too high on the price. The set retailed for 50 bones in 2009. The main reason you want this is because it&#39;s the only way to get this version of the pilot droid and it&#39;s the cheapest way to get count dooku clone wars and the magna guards. I would not recommend&nbsp;this set for everyone but if your a big star wars clone wars fan and you want all of the sets. You need this one. Thanks for tuning in and I will see you next time!</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-01-22T17:47:47.84Z","I’m not running away, I’m just advancing very quickly in the opposite direction!-Count Dooku","<p>Count Dooku&nbsp;plays an immense role in The Clone Wars animated series and in the Attack of The Clones before being killed by Anakin Skywalker on Palpatine&#39;s orders. The Solar Sailer&nbsp;is vital in the Count&#39;s cowardly escapes and (lo and behold) Lego took this opportunity to make another Star Wars Geonosis model.</p>

<p>Just before I start, this is probably one of the worst Star Wars sets I own, second only to a couple of battle packs. I was very tempted to &nbsp;rate this 2 stars but resisted the urge due to the speeder.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>There are four minifigures:</p>

<p>Count Dooku- no matter how you look at it, this is the best character in the set. He has a grey hair piece and a dark brown hood. There is nowhere to store the other hat-hair&nbsp;&nbsp;piece making it bad for playing with. His head has the normal scruffy beard and stoic&nbsp;frown. He wears dark one-sided robes with a clasp at the top. He wears a brown cape. The legs are plain. He is armed with a red light sabre with a curved, chrome hilt.</p>

<p>Pilot Droid- this droid is nothing special. It is composed of a rare white battle droid torso and legs but the head is a skeleton&nbsp;foot. This guy stands at an awkward angle in the cockpit. It would be better replaced by Count Dooku&#39;s droid that came in the 2013 Star Wars advent calendar, even if it meant reorganising the cockpit&#39;s structure. It wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing.</p>

<p>Magna Gaurdx2- the Magna Gaurds have normal dark grey battle droid torsos and legs. The cape is a light beige colour that is frayed at the ends. The heads are the best bits with mummy-like wrapping and a zombified&nbsp;head. They are armed with electro-staffs. They very rarely escort Dooku and normally accompany General Greivous. They would be better replaced like Geonosians or Clone Troopers.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The best parts are some of the minifig pieces and the purple translucent cones. Most of the pieces are brown, beige or grey.</p>

<p>Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where to start with the build! There is a large sticker sheet that adds minor detail. The ship kept on falling apart, was repetitive and all round not enjoyable. The ship always falls apart. It took me over an hour to build after the &#39;technical difficulties&#39;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Completed Model</p>

<p>The Speeder</p>

<p>The speeder is the best bit. It seats Count Dooku&nbsp;and has a holder for his light sabre. The overall structure is amazing, using only one sticker for massive effect, and it slots into the back of the Solar Sailer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ship</p>

<p>It has a very small cockpit, only fitting the pilot droid. There is no inside to the body nor anywhere to put the Magna Guards. The tops and bottom wing flaps move up and down. There are 4 flick-fire missiles that are pushed out by an impressive mechanism but it does lack playability. There are two doors at the back to let the speeder in and out but they are very flimsy and tend to fall off. The landing gear is completely unstable. The build just fails to capture the sleek ship from the Clone Wars.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Magna Guard heads</p>

<p>-Count Dooku</p>

<p>-The speeder</p>

<p>-Weapons</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-The landing gear</p>

<p>-The pilot droid</p>

<p>-The Magna guards</p>

<p>-Nowhere to put Dooku&#39;s extra hat-hair piece</p>

<p>-Nowhere to put Dooku out of speeder</p>

<p>-Nowhere to put the Magna Guards</p>

<p>-Lack of playability</p>

<p>-Flimsy</p>

<p>-Not sleek</p>

<p>-Price</p>

<p>-Falls apart</p>

<p>Overall, this is a really bad set from Lego and I would not choose it. The minifigs are bad and the structure is horrible. You&#39;re not getting away this time, Dooku!</p>
