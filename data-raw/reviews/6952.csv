PROS:
2 minifigs with good parts
Plane has some decent pieces including 8 slices of metallic cheese :)
The stand is cool and gives you some glasses and lime green tiles
A dark blue flag not from a castle set!
CHUCK NORRIS FACE!

CONS
Overpriced, and as far as i know, only available from an actual airplane
Plane isn't very realistic

Overall a good set i'd say even though i'm not that into City. 4/5

"United_Bricks","2011-02-15T13:59:27.8Z","Good set, but hard to get.","This set was released specially with only a couple of airlines, I got mine of ebay. The plane is good for any city fan who has an airport or just likes to play with them. The set comes with two minifigs, The pilot and the the ice cream seller.<h4>THE MINIFIGS</h4><p>The pilot comes with an brown pilots helmet he comes with an ordinary city face he also comes with a dark blue jack and brown pants.</p>The ice cream seller comes with a good designed hair piece which is brown, she has a girls head and she comes with a red torso with three logos on it and she comes grayish pants. <br><p>OVERALL 5/5 </p><br><h4>THE ICE CREAM STAND <br></h4><p>The ice cream stand is nice to put in your city were your people of your city can cool down and have a nice ice cream. It comes with one ice cream cup, it comes with two flavors chocolate and strawberry. It comes with a flag, the flag is dark blue. The patten on the top of the stand is light green and white. The stand is a good design. OVERALL 4/5</p><br><h4>THE PLANE</h4><p>The plane has a patten of white, red and black on it. The plane is a nice design, It would be great fun for any young children. Its comes some good pieces, for example it has six slope parts. It has nine stickers, their are stickers on the propeller they come of easily so be careful. The stickers make it look a lot better. OVERALL 4/5<br></p><p><br></p><h4>OVERALL</h4><p>Good design on both things, great minifigs. One bad thing is its hard to get but still its good. I would give this set a 13/15. <br></p><p>(Please look at my other reviews, Legoboy12345678)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </h4>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
