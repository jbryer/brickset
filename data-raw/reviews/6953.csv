Out of the box it already had some unique pieces I did not have in my collection not to mention the blue rock monster with 2 blue crystals.  Build time was not real long but it is very well put together.  Aside from the hood that pops off very easy the rest holds together very well.  ANd the DYNO shooter well what can you say but AWESOME!! the fireing mechanisim is sooooooo much better then flicker missles and you get 3 packs of TNT with it.  

Pros :  TNT !
          Blue Rocky
          2 Blue Crystals
          Awesome design

Cons:  hood falls off easy
       Nothing else

"_phoenix","2009-01-18T13:19:09.513Z","Must own for any power miners fan","This set is great. the only problem is that duke should come with a helmet. I think its silly having a two sided head with both sides showing. And as an overall subject, I might say something about the names. Most I'm fine with, but Some minifigs have the same names. So I call the one with the bomb vest fuse, since he is a bomb technician.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bluemoose","2009-02-05T09:42:00.983Z","Disappointing","I was quite excited about this 'exclusive' set; unfortunately it didn't match my level of expectation.

The build was quite simple, and the design isn't up to the standard of the other Power Miners sets. It seems like an 'afterthought' set; one that wasn't up to scratch for the mainstream theme releases, but just about 'good enough' for a store exclusive. There seems to be less play value than the other Power Miners sets.

There are a few nice pieces in it, but nothing to get overly excited about.

IMHO, you'd be much getter off getting the 'Thunder Driller' if you don't already have it. If you have already got 'Thunder Driller', but still feel the need for more Power Miners, I'd recommend getting another 'Thunder Driller' and building an alternate model of your own from that set.

Pros:
Dynamite!
Rock monster!
Plows.
Treads.

Roll cage.

Cons:
To many sets with Glaciator. Should have Boulderax or Firox.

"ET","2009-03-14T16:58:12.293Z","Blast those monsters!","This is a good set for only $25 dollars, which is an exellent deal.

Pros:

Dynamite is not flick-fire
2 crystals
3 dynamites

Cons:
WAY to many Glaciators in the sets, should have been Boulderax

"andy87","2009-06-12T23:47:57.14Z","hmmm","First of all, im gonna say this: its smaller then you might expect, and that the miner's hat lets you see both of his faces which pretty much ruins the point of double faces. There have also been way too many of the blue monsters/ On the plus side, this vechicle shoots dynomite which is a sweet feature.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Harm1","2009-11-02T13:30:01.107Z","Quite ok.","I'm not into power miners at all, so when I received this set as a gift, I wasn't immediately very enthausiastic. I was pleasantly surprised though when I built the set, maybe because my expectations were low.

Pro's: 
- nice pieces/colours
- design looks much better in reality then on the pictures
- launching device actually works

Con's:
- unchallenging build
- ugly stickers (don't use them, it looks better without)
- Technic pieces for the crawlers would have been nicer
- building instructions are oversimplified

Keeping in mind the target group, I'd give this set a 7.5 out of 10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-27T20:38:36.153Z","Cool Vehicle!","This appears to be a completely new type of mining vehicle, which makes it plain awesome! The system that makes the dynamite fire is very complicated and cool. The picture above lies about two things The first thing is the crystals are blue. The second thing is the missiles the dynamite is on have axles as backs. The bulldozer blades are very move-able. Like all power miners, the engineer's head is dual sided. There is a crate in the back not shown here that can store the utensils and crystals.

pros:
Glaciator.
Dynamite launcher.
Bulldozer blades.
Crate for storage.
Original design.

cons:
A bit fragile.

A good set to play with. I recommend this to any lego fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cheeseballs","2009-12-13T10:31:01.437Z","Nice Addition","Like I said in the title it is a nice addition to any pm collection. I think that Lego could've given it some improvements like another minifig or a different rock monster than Glaciator because he's the most common rock monster. Also, lego should have made it bigger, because all of the pieces are really small. The treads don't work that well, they don't grip on the wheels.

Now, lets move on to what Lego did right. They made a set with treads. Woohoo!! Lego designed a pretty good dynamite launcher for this set. Plus, I have never seen those little bulldozer pieces before.

Pros:
-treads
-dozer pieces
-cool dynamite launcher
- lots of lime green
-detailed
-cool looking

Cons:
-Glaciator
- 1 minifig
-treads don't grip well
-small

All in all, this still makes a good addon to any pm collection. Although, if you are someone who just buys Lego sets if they look cool don't buy this unless you really want it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"TheFadedTBCap","2010-03-08T20:22:49.7Z","The Power Miners Ultimate Underground Tank!","<p>This is an awesome set and is a great addition to the Power Miner team.&nbsp; It really fires dynamite missiles when ever you turn the knob.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>

    <li>Cannon really fires</li>
    <li>Moveable plows</li>

"EtudeTheBadger","2010-03-28T16:59:05.14Z","KABOOM!","<p>Any explosives are useful on a mining expedition, hey? From a little dab of gel-ignite to a crate of dynamite, no boom is too big when looking for those crystals we need so much.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such a philosophy is right slap behind the Boulder Blaster, a tracked tank-bulldozer hybrid with a magazine full of that dynamite! Loaded with tanks of some sort of exotic fuel and equipped with the best driver on the Power Miners team, no rock is too big to stand in the way.</p>
<p>On that note, let's begin the review in earnest. The Boulder Blaster is fun, oh so fun to build. Tracks can be a pain sometimes, but these glided nicely onto their running wheels without preamble or trouble. The dynamite firing mechanism is flawless, with a spring-loaded flair lacking in flick-fire systems often seen today. Some more of those new Crystals, blue this time, are here to make Rock Raiders fanatics dribble with excitement, along with a vicious Glaciator to guard them. THe plows are a nice touch, too, allowing the Blaster to doze through minor rockfalls caused by these explosions.</p>
<p>As great as the vehicle is, there are some flaws- and we're right back to the treads. The tracks, while good-looking, don't move well due to some protruding features like gas bottles and the catapult launcher, often becoming stuck on them. What good is a vehicle if it doesn't move that great? The gas canisters are also a problem, if not for practical reasons then reasons affixed in logic- why expose them? They're volatile containers, and if struck by a rock that's a hair too big- well, a very ironic KABLAMMO! The roll cage also comes off easily, as do those gas tanks!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Great looking</li>
    <li>More Crystals</li>
    <li>More Monsters in the collection</li>
    <li>Loads more DYNAMITE!</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons: <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flimsy in places</li>
    <li>Lack of mobility</li>
    <li>Nearly no protection for the driver</li>
    <li>Cap also exposes both faces on miner- never tagged Professor Quirrell as a Power Miner!</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the cons, and based on the pros, a great set- just don't count on it to move too muchie. It's best used as a stationary artillery unit.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"charliebucket","2016-07-11T22:44:33.37Z","The only bad Power Miners set","<p>Back when I was 5, Power Miners was great and so was this... thing; 7 years later and, well I still like Power Miners... but not this :(</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>!Disclaimer! I do&nbsp;not remember the box too well so most of this is guess work.</p>

<p>The box is rectangular in shape and has pictures of different angles of the atrocity that is the boulder blaster. &nbsp;Opening the box you probably will find: 2 loose caterpillar&nbsp;treads, 1 instruction book, 1 sticker sheet, and 2 numbered bags of pieces. &nbsp;The instructions&nbsp;have a cave-like background and are easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is nothing in particular that stands out to me; but new fans of the range will find a large amount of lime green parts. &nbsp;For me the only exiting thing would be the 2 treads.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The 2 (or 1 1/2) minifigs&nbsp;are good, albeit a bit plain, but with both Rex and&nbsp;Glaciator coming in other sets the only thing that makes this selection&nbsp;of minifigs&nbsp;unique is that this version of Rex comes with a beanie.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The assembly&nbsp;of the set takes about 20 to 30 minutes&nbsp;and&nbsp;is the best part of the model by a long shot,&nbsp;simply because it is somewhat enjoyable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished set looks like a tractor with treads and a V8 engine with some sort of rocket launcher attachment slapped on.&nbsp; And, on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, the action feature (turn a cog and dynamite shoots out) does not work properly, and it makes a weird grindy, scrapey&nbsp;noise when rolled across the carpet.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is has &quot;special edition&quot; on the front of the box but it does not feel like one. &nbsp;Nor does it feel like a normal retail set. &nbsp;Not a good set.&nbsp;:&#39;(</p>

<p>I hope this helped you choose your next Lego set :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>P.S: LEGO&#39;s official image is incorrect: the set has 2 BLUE crystals not 2 RED ones.</p>
