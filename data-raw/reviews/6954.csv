"_add_um","2009-11-01T13:21:29.81Z","One of the Best","This is is one the coolest bionilces out there. Its is great looking villian, he looks theating. It comes with a club and lancher. The club looks really good and deadly, the launcher works very well.The mask is cool looking aswell. The colour scheme of red and black goes great for the look. Also it has the action figure thing on his back which I don't care for. If your a bionicle fan you add it to your collection its is one this year's best bionicles.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-10-31T13:39:35.28Z","Hello from Italy!","Ciao a tutti dall'Italia!(Translation: Hello everyone from Italy!) This Bionicle must be the MOST heavily armoured brute I've EVER bought! It has masses of armour! Don't worry if the club is a one-piece cheap job: it is composed of two halves!

Pros:
Armour
Club
Mean looks

Cons:
None!

Overall, a great brute!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"knuclear200x","2009-12-28T23:13:27.733Z","I'm the Captain Caveman of the graveyard train!","Prologue:
When I think about Bionicle being cancelled, I think of Malum, Skrall, and this guy. A lot of fans have dreaded as some have praised this moment stating that the line has been getting old, delivering nothing new, and not finding enough use for most of the pieces. Sure their pieces aren't as useful for every creation and our minds can't always find uses right away, but this line has grown so much since the day they stopped using that swivel action feature of the earlier lines, I mean they gave these guys a few more unique weapons, armor pieces, torsos and ACTUAL FISTS this time. In my opinion, the fists were a truly BIG DEAL in the line's evolution, but I digress. For me, Bionicle was more of an action figure line that kicked Technic to the curb and had many regular Lego compatible surprises. It is what filled my empty soul for XEVOZ. Remember XEVOZ? If you do, you were probably one of the many who discovered their awesome mix and match system, great sculpting and no-compromise quality durability. I discovered XEVOZ late, collecting what was left and regretting what I've missed. So it's sad that these guys have to go. I can only hope that Lego's next projects will still be as great as this, or hopefully even better.

When it comes to Bionicle, they don't always look good on the box. I thought this guy was just one of those dumb looking ones in the group. But until I saw the live display at a store, I just drooled over it and the cops kicked me out and beat me with billy clubs and tasers all day DUH I mean I just knew I had to get it and I did.

To describe him in a few words, ""he's a hulk with a lot of bulk"". The helmet is a thicker, spikier version of Skrall's xenomorph helmet. The shoulder pads are big and try to be just as pointy in every direction. The thighs are guarded by those spiky turtle-shell pads, while the forearms and shins use those thick black limbs and look good on their own. And then there's the spike crotch, yeah maybe he can jackhammer his enemies to death.

The weapons include the mumble-mumble thornax launcher yeah and a BIG-donkey club! Lookit that club! It's really just two pieces of each side, similar to the Cement Mixer tank from the 2007 City line, as a whole club would probably be to heavy for a regular Bionicle. It is also spiky, and that is boss.

Articulation is very good, and the shoulder pads aren't pinned in which gives his arms a lot of free movement.

Cons:
The thin, upper arms are bare with no armor on them, giving him somewhat of a Popeye look, and there's only one club. If I was him I'd trade that Thornax launcher for another club...or a bigger blaster. However these can be fixed with a few spare pieces lying around.

Just sayin:
Being the guy with just a club, I tend to think that buying one won't do. He'd be a perfect candidate for army-building. On the other hand, maybe a big axe instead of a club will look really good. That's something we will find out and decide on our own.

Overall:
Big, bulky bionicle with a big bad-donkey billy club...and mumble thornax mumble. This is one guy you don't want to miss. In a line of warriors he'd be the guy who fights with pure strength, rage, and aggression. And if you need more of that, you'll know where to find him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legojii","2010-01-24T02:23:37.67Z","Cool looking stony black guy ","This is my first bionicle set and maybe the last..not thet this set put me off bionicle quite the opposite its spoiled me..the others just dont look cool enough. 

First lets start withthe build..challenging it was not but the detail is quite great..the set is made for posing..well actually it was made for a game but i dont like the game so i dont pose him with the launcher, i gave him a flaming dagger from the space police set with 2 vehicles, a stop sign and a stop light..look it up. and i must say it looks cool that he has 2 weapons, it looks more balanced.

Like i said earlier its made for posing..right now i have him in battle against my Exo-force River Dragon. The bottom line is the set looks awsome as a antagonist to your lego sets,,looks like something bad and destructive they will have a devil of a time defeating..some people say he looks squat and small..you can make him taller by extending his neck a bit.

Over all AWSOME.
