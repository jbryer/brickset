"deadtree103","2009-07-13T00:23:51.59Z","Ooh, Shiny new set!","I bought this at my local Wal-mart yesterday evening for $14.98 CAD. They had all six of them there.And it has something we haven't seen since Jaller Inika. . . . . . . .A Flame Sword!Anyways, Pro's and Con's time!

PROS
What I liked about it.

*Lot's of recolored peices.
*Some new peices.
*Great new Flame Sword.
*Cheaper way to get the Orange Inika Chest Armor.

CONS
What I disliked about it.

*Not that many new pieces.
*Recolored Helmet.
*Ankle gaurds are a little floppy.
*Flame Sword looks a little goofy when being held by the figure.

All in All it's a good set(Except for the Floppy ankle gaurds). But it looks better when not holding the Sword.

But this gets a 4 from me.

I'm not a Bionicle expert, I don't buy every Bionicle but I do buy every red one, just to see how they are evolving and I believe that, apart from the head and shin guards, there are no new Bionicle parts in this set. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

After 5 years of dark red LEGO have returned to regular bright red and to me it looks very dated and not unlike the original 2001 red Bionicle 8534.

He has no cons really allot of people complain about the wobbly armor and Berix recovered helmet but really it's livable.  The wobbly armor is there so it doesn't restrict the foot movement.  And Berix's helmet is just livable.  Here are the pros, cons, and exclusive pieces.

I greatly underestimated Ackar. But once I had built him, I was wowed out.

Pros:

Everything

Cons:

Nothing

People on Brickset have been complaining about the shin guards wobbling, but if they didn't, the feet would be greatly restricted.

"Tri_pod_king","2009-11-27T17:40:37.827Z","My 300th Lego set- Great 300th set!","    I thought it just worthy of note that this was my 300th set. Thatâ€™s pretty darn good.
Since 2004, we've been getting dark-red ionicles. It all started with Toa Vakama, all the way up to Malum. The dark-red was nice, but it kind of got boring after a while. We longed for normal red and orange. Ackar brings these colors back in a way that makes you say, ''Wow, what a nicely colored figure!''.
      I was incredibly happy with this figure. He has a lot of nice features. I can only think of three cons that might annoy people, but I myself have looked at the glass as half full.
        First, he has grey hands, where as other people have said they should be yellow or orange. Me personally, the grey hands work for me. They look cool.
        Secondly, he has the same mask as Berix, only red. It works. The mask looks cool, and the back looks flamey.
        Thirdly, The new shin guard attachments- they're nice, but they're loose and wobbly. The solution? Get those small blue technic pieces- you know, the ones that are used a lot in bionicles, the ones where it's half axle, half pins (axle pin with friction)- stick the pin half in the shin, the axle half into the shin guard, and it's fixed!
      So those are the 'cons', but onto the other things. The flame sword is AWESOME. It looks like Tahu's flame sword, but bigger and better! The thornax launcher is- well, a thornax launcher. Nothing special there. The shoulder armor is simple, yet unique. It's quite nice.
    In Conclusion: I was really happy with Ackar. His colors are nice, his attention to detail is nice, everything's NICE!

"james3426","2009-10-17T18:47:29.967Z","""Pay attention and you might actually learn something.""","Ackar is just plain awesome! He is my favorite Glatorian over all the original and Legends. He is also my favorite Glatorian story-wise. When I watched ""The Legend Reborn I brought out all the characters and vehicles that would be in the movie, along with Ackar, and added on the shield that he uses. The Flame Sword has that awesome flame piece that reminds me of Tahu's. The hilt is also very cool and good for MOCs. The Helmet is a recolored Berix helmet. The Ankle guards look Vahi-like and are also good for MOCs. The combination of orange and classic red are also very cool.
 
Pros:
Classic red and orange are awesome together.
The hilt and ankle guards are great for MOCing.
Recolored helmet has an even cooler color combination than the original.
Flame Piece is Awesome.
Blades on upper arms look good.

Cons:
NONE

In all, an awesome canister set. I recommend this to anyone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vexorian","2010-02-04T17:30:59.137Z","Epic look and a color scheme that was missed.","Mata red. Ever since 2004 that color was removed from the bionicle palette. Although dark red is cool it was used way too much on red toa. But this time, for the last line of Bionicle canister sets, LEGO brought this color back.

Basically, the set is very nice. Of course, if you do not like the inika build being used in every single set, then you will not like this one. But otherwise, it comes with a good asortment of pieces, specially considering the use of mata red. Counting this one and also the Skrall from the previous wave you can have many pieces in that color and maybe make a new version of Tahu...

Anyway, another thing to notice that is not visible from the pic is that the flames are actually semi-transparent. They are also slightly larger than Tahu's fire.

Pros:
* He is got an epic look. I think this is the most ""legendary"" looking legend.
* Color scheme is a blast from the toa mata past.
* Reminds me more of Tahu than Tahu star.

Cons:
* Yes, shin guards are wobbly,  I do not think it is a bad thing.


Disturbing:
* Due to the color scheme and the glatorian head, there is an stage during build in which he definitely looks like iron man, sort of funny.

As always with 2009 sets the thornax launcher is out of place and the thornax looks like cheap rubber ruining the whole set but the good thing is that you can just take it off, you earn 2 red cross pins and two silver pieces, these pieces have proven in my case to be useful for MoCs ^^. Same with the life counter, unless you are interested in playing you might prefer to take it out.

I actually bought him to make a Tahu revamp, but now that I see his finished look I am undecided.

<p>May be a little biased as I got this also from my teacher with a bunch of stuff missing. But either way, the parts, playability, and building experience weren&#39;t great. I thought to look up all the Bionicle sets a year ago to see if I was hating too much on the guy, but nope, Ackar is a little bland for his $13 Original price.
