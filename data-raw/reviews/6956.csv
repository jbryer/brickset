"baylego","2009-06-19T18:39:17.53Z","Very Interesting"," I got this set at my local TRU along with Mata Nui, and I didnt have to pay a cent more! Also, when you spend $19.99 or more on legos there, you get a free guide to dark hunters book ( http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=B031-1 ) and that was a steal! Now on to the actual set.

      The build was the most interesting from a canister set ive seen. The shoulder and head piece looks like a fusion of snakes and plants, and is very cool. Overall, thhis set has no cons, and I would reccomend this set to anybody! Make sure that you spend the $19.99 (if you can) to get youre free book. Awesome 6/5! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

well there you have it vastus all summed up!! :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-12-25T01:41:40.343Z","It is now official: Vastus is my favourite Glatorian!","The title just about sums it up really. Vastus is a truly great achievement by LEGO. I absolutely LOVE the snake tails and snake heads theme and the Venom Scythe is just the icing on the cake. Interesting fact: First ever Bionicle scythe!
The colour scheme, as with all green Bionicles, is great. LEGO chose just the right pieces for lime and just the right pieces for dark green.

There has been a lot of arguing over the Inika pad on Vastus' chest (most of it being negative), and I'll admit that it does make him look a bit dumbo magumbo the way the instructions say, but here is a perfectly good and equally awesome solution: PUT IT ON UPSIDE DOWN! It looks great and Vastus is no longer a fat guy.

Now: NEW AND ANCIENT PIECES.
Vastus has alot of new pieces, and the Hordika legs are the aformentioned ANCIENT PIECES, seeing as they have not been used since the Hordika, in the year 2000andsomething. A welcome addition once again. The Inika feet have finally been done in solid green! It was kinda dumb how they were two-toned with silver on Inika Kongu, but Vastus fixes all problems!
I'm sure that everyone who has ever scene Vastus realizes that the shoulder pads are new and extremely detailed. They have two snake heads in the middle and two snake tails, one on either side of the snake heads. Very nice indeed and EXTREMELY GREAT for MOCing! Vastus' helmet wins helmet of the year for me. It is superb! The central snake tail leads into a snake head just above Vastus' eyes, with the two elongated fangs coming down and forming a gap in the helmet. So if your into MOCing, Vastus is for you.

PROS AND CONS:

Pros:

Helmet
Shoulder pads
Scythe
Venom Tube
Snake theme
...To cut a long story short, EVERYTHING!

Cons:

nothing

Now, people have also been complaining about Vastus' posability. This is mainly because his scythe is held in both hands. But, simple add in one of those pieces that connects the top of the venom tube into where the top hand is, and then you can swing it freely, although personally, I've achieved some wicked poses out of him with him holding onto the scythe with both hands. This method does however leave the former top hand rather empty, however, so if you don't like empty handed Glatorian, I suggest you either keep it as the instructions say or find a new method yourself.

Overall Vastus is an awesome set and I recommend him to EVERYONE!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kapoka79","2009-08-12T17:21:08.78Z","Vastus, Glatorian Legend!","Vastus is pretty cool but there are some things holding him back from being great.

Pros :

Cool Mask
Life Counter
Thornax Launcher
Awesome venom spear
New pieces
Good Color Scheme
Very detailed


Cons:

A bit overpriced
All Glatorian sets only come with one thornax. There needs to be more I think.
Shoulder armor sometimes gets in the way
A little difficult to pose
Okay Playability
Toa Hordika Legs dont look that great. (Minor Problem though)


Surprisingly there is not very much armor on him like the other Glatorian. Overall he's really good and I recommend him.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"tahu2008","2009-10-13T17:41:58.84Z","Vastus","Vastus is quite a good set compared to some of this years other sets.  The reoccurring snake theme is very cool, especially his helmet.  This is also the first technic scythe, which is awesome. However, I dislike the hordika legs, which wiggle slightly.  The thornax at the end of the staff makes posing him firing it hard.

Pros
Snake theme
Helmet
scythe
lime green hands and arms

Cons 
Hordika legs
thornax on end of staff
lower chest armor looks awkward.

Vastus is a very good set, but could have been better.  However, he is a welcome choice compared to some other glatorian sets.   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"IJL30","2009-08-28T20:21:57.343Z","mostly good ","Vastus is very cool. I really like him he only has a few cons and a lot of pros.

Pros: his main body part is flipped around, his thornax is attached differently, his life thing is attached differently, & his stinger thing is cool.
Cons: Everything else.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2010-01-25T15:06:46.217Z","Vastus, Jungle Glatorian","Vastus was really good when I got him. His snake armour is NOT rubber, thank goodness, and I like the way his Thornax Launcher is attached to his Venom Talon. He is actually more posable than people seem to think.

Pros:
Posable
Thornax launcher
Good colour scheme
Stands up well
Life counter

Cons:
Rubbery teeth attached to his upper arm armour, which is extremely hard to fit in, giving him a 4
Only one Thornax

Overall, a good Glatorian, 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
