This is one of the great new sets from bionicle but on the down side, it is the only set with # of peices below 52. The other 5 have 52 peices or 55 peices. Other than that she pretty cool!

This was very fast and easy to build. But lego managed to keep it fun with new peices and new-ish peices

The fins are great on her. Also her mask (or others would say helmet) is kinda in the shape of a manta ray. And I love manta rays. 

Pros:
Very cool torso
4 dark blue fins
2 silver staff peices
Light blue hands
Life counter
Thornax
Thornax Launcher
She is skinny (good for female)
New Arms/Legs

Best Feature:
The Mask/Helmet looks great!

Cons:
Lowest Legends peice count
Seen these feet and legs before
Life counter was a bit too high
(so I turned mine up-side down)

Over all Kiina is a great legends set and is a very cool member of the water tribe and you will LOVE HER ALOT! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ggggggggggggggggggggggggg","2009-07-27T16:38:04.95Z","finally a custom torso.","Kiina is a great set, especially the colours and the helmet. The vapor trident is a great addition to the set and is great for toa nikila MOC's the custom torso makes it more enjoyble to build then most canister sets today, I also love the leg/arm armour as they are great for claws.Although I'm annoyed again by the fact that you get 1 thornax but I think it's quite expensive to make thornax.now to the pros and cons.

pros
helmet
colour scheme
arm/leg armour
trident
the torso
thornax launcher

cons
1 thornax
life counter is quite high
red axle's

Overall kiina is a great set and would please any bionicle fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-09-12T12:33:41.873Z","Kiina, fighter for the Water tribe","First, I would like to say that the previous review has said that Kiina is the only Glatorian for the Water tribe. Tarix is the other Glatorian for the Water tribe, also the tri-fin armor is on the Cendox V1. 

Build-
Kiina has a very short torso, shorter than the Agori torsos. She has a black life counter holder. Her shoulder armor should definately been pointing upward. The armor on her legs keeps her fro siting down properly. She has the pointed type feet in light blue. The torso armor/neck is also light blue. She has the athletic legs and arms like Gresh's in dark blue. The mask is dark blue with a bit of light gray/silver. Her under arms/legs are light blue. Her 
foot-connecters are dark blue. The tri-fin armor is dark blue and has a half axle molded onto each one. The hands are light blue. Her Thornax launcher is conncted to her hand, not with a Toa-hand like Gresh's. Her torso piece that connects to the legs is dark blue. She has two piped tridents that make a Dual Vapor Tident together. Her head is see-through yellow-green, more yellow than green. 

Play-
She is great to play with and that is all I can think of for this section.

Story-
Kiina is the only female Glatorian. She is great friends with Ackar and Mata Nui. She is a great driver of the Thornatus V9.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kibble123456789","2009-09-03T21:09:53.56Z","Amazing!","Nothing wrong with her the only water Glatorian is awesome!  She has awesome everything staff, feet, legs, mask, armor, color scheme, everything!  Her exclusive parts include:

pros:
- feet

- custom torso yay!
- skinny and small 
- 1 of the coolest water weapon correct that the coolest
- awesome helmet that resembles a manta ray
- long and cool fin armor

cons:
- her torso is slightly wobbly but just add 2 small blue pieces to correct that other then that correctable thing she's perfect!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"trewerd","2009-10-09T22:48:26.357Z","I think they're on to something good.","Do you like fish? If so, you'll love Kiina.
Now then, I went to the store today and after a seriously long thought process, I bought some Bionicles. Kiina was one of them. 

Now, as sets go, Kiina is pretty ordinary (well, at least her limbs are anyway), nearly everything is ordinary, save for her torso. Instead of using the really REALLY overused Inika and Piraka Torsos, hers utilizes that lego technic piece that looks like a triangle coathanger. Now, this makes her body really small, but surprisingly feminine.

As toys go, Lego doesn't exactly have the best track record of feminine looking bionicles (take a look at Toa Gali Mistika), but Kiina really pulls it off (despite how the boxart may appear). Maybe it's the long legs/small torso combo.

Anyway,

Pros:

-Finally a feminine Bionicle that looks the part.
-Nice aquatic fin pieces (see boxart).
-Clever torso build.

Cons: 

-generic looking weapon
-Price to Pieces ratio is kind of off (12.99 for only 40 something pieces)
-Life counter limits head poseability (easily fixed by attaching it upside-down)

Final Verdict: I like it. Her design is kind off weird, but it's rather characterfull. She gets my recommendation.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-20T15:18:41.187Z","""Waahhooo!""","Kiina has an awesome new design and some cool new pieces. The helmet has a wavy thing in the back, and looks like a manta ray, as someone else said. The vapor trident is the best trident ever, in my opinion. The new armor pieces look like gills. These feet are the first ""Inika Clawed"" in this color. 

Pros:
Cool helmet.
New armor.
Vapor Trident.
Upper limbs with holes on sides.
Recolored Inika feet.
Recolored Vahki Leg.
New torso.

Cons:
NONE!

An Awesome Glatorian. Get her along with Ackar in you don't already have him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-12-12T00:32:01.327Z","A fishy foe","Past reviewers of Kiina have said that there is something fishy about her. I now confirm that theory. She is EXTREMELY fishy.

Pros:

Unique torso
Double-ended trident
Thornax launcher
New upper arms
Fishy shoulder pads
Fishy helmet
Small torso and long limbs make her seem more girly
Colour scheme
MY FIRST FEMALE BIONICLE!

Cons:

Abso-fishy-lutely nothiing!

Finally, the fishy shoulder pads have plus-pins connected to their bottom. Some people might see this as a con. It is indeed an interesting change from usual.

Kiina is a truly great Bionicle, and I would highly recommend her.

"Alemas","2010-12-17T08:06:21.337Z","WARNING: FRAGILE pieces!","<h4>Overview</h4>This set was released in the Summer of 2009, a year of change in the Bionicle universe. It introduced a whole new world, new characters, and would eventually see the end of Bionicle in 2010. Kiina is a female Glatorian (read: Toa without elemental powers) of the water tribe, and her fishy pieces reflect this.<br><h4>Building Experience</h4>When I built this, the build was a bit different than normal: Kiina has no ""one-piece"" body; it is composed of several little pieces joined together to form a body. Be warned though when building: Since a while, Bionicle sets have the nasty habit of cracking sockets, and for this, the set gets a low score. This didn't happen to me when building, but... read on. 3/5<br><h4>Parts</h4>Right, what do we have? Fishy pieces, new leg pieces with pin holes and an axle hole at the SIDES, nice staff, and a new mask. Good work LEGO! 4/5<br><h4>Playability</h4>Standard Bionicle playability. Nice poseability, good set to play with. It even has a ""life counter"" for a game (rules are in the instruction booklet). So why a 3? One reason: CRACKING PIECES. I was re-assembling Kiina, and, while re-attaching an arm piece, one of the socket ""prongs"" simply snapped off completely while inserting it into a ball. I even tried to make it as ""painless"" for the piece as possible. My theory is that there is a lack of flexibility; the prongs are too stiff, so when they widen, they crack. This has been happening since a while now (since 2008, I think), and now many of the prongs of my sets are cracked (but still usable). 3/5<br><h4>Value for Money</h4>Â£8.99? Sounds good to me! 4/5<br><h4>Overall</h4>A good set, if it wasn't for the fact that the sockets are so fragile now. I advise you to exercise caution when inserting and re-inserting sockets into balls. But even then, it may not be enough. 3/5",TRUE,3,4,3,3,4
"KodakKid365","2010-11-17T18:04:30.97Z","Not what I would call good.","Okay, I just really don't like Kina. I don't like the weapons, the colors, the armors, I don't like her at all! Now that is sorta an opinion. So I'm not really recommending her to you but if you think she's cool then I'm fine with that.",FALSE,3,4,4,4,3
