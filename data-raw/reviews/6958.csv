But, just like the other dude said, looking at the picture has no justice. Gelu is AWESOME! There are only a few cons! (That's why it's not a 5.) well, on to the PROS & CONS!

PROS
. mask is cool!
.I read somwhere that gelu's mask is modeld after a wolf.
. makes ya' think he's a toa of ice
. cool leg and arm desing
. Ice slicer!


CONS
. too many stolen parts 
. thornax is weird 

Other than that, it's a good set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2009-07-28T14:04:41.78Z","Retired Glatorian of Ice","When I got Gelu today, I thought he is good. Most of his Ice Slicer is rubber and translucent, giving it an icy appearance. He also has two half-Metus-sheilds on his shoulders. The colour scheme is good and he is very posable, but there is one downside to Gelu:
Nothing new.

We have seen almost exact copies of his design before, and there is only 2 types of new pieces. Overall, he is very good, but boring.

Pros:
Half-translucent Ice Slicer
Good Colour Scheme
Posable
Stands up well
Thornax Launcher
Life Counter

Cons:
Same old boring Inika design

Overall, a good set, 4/5

"Kapoka79","2009-08-13T12:39:56.2Z","Gelu, Former Glatorian!","Gelu has to be the best Glatorian that has come out so far along with Vorox and Mata Nui.

Pros: 

-Coolest mask I've ever seen
-Life Counter
-Thornax Launcher
-Awesome Ice Slicer
-Easy and Fun to Pose
-Good Playability
-Shoulder armor looks good and doesn't get in the way like other Glatorians shoulder armor does.
-A few new pieces
-Great Color Scheme 
-Very Detailed
-Hands?

Cons:

-A tad bit overpriced in the United States
-There needs to be more than one thornax I think

Overall he's great and should be one of the first Glatorian you get if you don't already have him",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"exo_force_fan200","2009-08-08T14:37:23.73Z","  At long last, Lanti is complete!","  First, an explanation for the title.  Since I heard about about the Glatorian, I have been planning a MOC of an ice Glatorian called Lanti.  I originally was going to use Metus's helmet, and I was having trouble deciding on the weapons, and when saw Gelu, I knew I had found matches for both.  
  The body is that same old Inika build.  Nothing new, same life counter as well.  The only original thing is the chest armor.  This is a brand new color for Inika Chest Armor Type 2.  Like Gelu's helmet and chest armor, I fell in love with it at first sight. 
  The legs aren't new at all, except for the re-coloring of the feet and shins.
  The arms are the best part of the set.  Putting the Snowflake Shields on the back of the arms was an ingenious idea.  The Thornax is the best Bionicle Launcher Lego has made, and the sword goes very nicely with Snowflake shields.
  Lastly, the head.  The mask is new, but nothing else has changed.  Just be glad Gelu doesn't suffer from the disease known as Strakk-Neck.
  All in all, Gelu is an average Glatorian.  Although for me, he's pretty good just because he's ice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mr_brightside711","2009-07-05T18:51:35.107Z","Ice, Ice Baby!","Gelu was the second Legends set I got and he, like Kiina, is also very cool. Sure hes gotta lot of used many, many, many times parts but you know they can't always make new peices!

The build was a peice of cake. Mostly cause I've built a billon like it.

He has a very winter snow storm vibe to him. I think it is because the snowflake armor and his spiked Mask and duel sided weapon.

Pros:
Good Sized
White Hands
Thornax
Thornax Launcher
Silver and Light blue trans weapon
Life counter
Mask/Helmet
Snow flake Armor

Best Feature:
His very sleek duel-sided sword

Cons:
Many many many used peices.

Maybe if they through in a new leg, this would be perfect. But thats the point of Legos. They are not perfect. Thats why you add peices or change it up so it's perfect for you! and I think GELU IS A GREAT BIONICLE FOR THE HARDCORE BIONICLE FANS!

"Carl","2009-10-31T19:25:42.997Z","Thank you james3426","Thanks james3426. I made a mistake and now with your helpful comment I can change my statement. But why would I need to?

Gelu has massively grown on me. After a good long hard look at him, I decided that he really was a good Glatorian Legend. Now I don't mind the fact that he is an Inika Clone, because Lego made Inika Clones have spunk with Gelu. The weapon is great. The mask is great. Even the stolen snow flake shoulder pads are great. And the old Inika chest plate in white is a welcome bonus too. The Thornax, as always, fires well.

In my other review of Gelu I said that he wasn't worthy of being in the Ice Tribe. But now I have changed my mind as I did with Malum and I believe with more Bionicles like Gelu we are in store for some good stuff in the future.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"supertails387","2009-10-08T10:55:08.42Z","gelu:the buisnessman of all glatorian,","this is a pretty good set! I reckomend it to any bionicle fan, (unless, of course, you hate the color white, =P) now on to the pros and cons:

PROS:
-HANDS! 
-the ice slicer is transparent! (kinda)
-pwnage mask
-IrOn MaN hEaD!!
-snowflake things on the back
-some resemblence of lewas gliders (if you take off the thornax launcher and put one blde in each hand, that is =P)

*cough*CONS*cough* 
-The ice slicer blades wobble! I don't know if it was an accident, or it just came like that,

thats it!! here is my overall rating,
rating:5/5

"trewerd","2009-10-12T20:12:42.577Z","Sum of His Parts?","Ok, I really only got this guy becuase of his parts. This toy comes with many old pieces, like the Inika chesplate, Toa Metru legs, Ignika Feet, Vahki limbs and whatnot. The only new things he has are his shoulders (which are pieces of the ice shield from the ice agori), his helmet, and his swords.

Pros: 
- Good Pieces overall. The toy comes with some nice pieces you may have missed out on if you skipped Toa Inika.
- He's characterful. His mask, in combination with the ironman head piece they're using now, makes him look like a brooding hero.

Cons:
- Awkward to pose. I really can't get him into any pose that looks cool, which is a shame becuase he really looks the part.
- Elbow Limit. His elbow joint is limited by the armor on his arm.
- Flimsy Crystal Blades. They look cool, but get your hands on one, and you'll see just how flimsy they feel.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-18T19:13:02.547Z","Caravan Guard","It's Inika clone, Carl. The Ignika is the Mask of Life and the Inika were a group of Toa and Inika also means ""Spirits of the Stars"" in Matoran. On to the review.

I don't care about if he's an Inika clone, I think he's one of the best Glatorian of the twelve. The Ice Slizer is just plain awesome. He also has blended pieces like at least three of six in a group have. These blended pieces are: snowflake halves and the helmet. He also has the first white Inika chest plate, Hahli style. My favorite thing to do with him is fight Ackar.

Pros:
Awesome Slicer.
Blended pieces.
Cool Helmet.
Thornax Launcher fires far.

Cons:
None.

In all, a great canister set. In my opinion, this is the third best Glatorian. 
I recommend this to any Bionicle fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KodakKid365","2010-09-02T11:46:43.967Z","Awesome equipment!","The double weapons are awesome. Even only one is cool! It's not as shiny as it is in the picture though. The arm armor dosen't look as cool so I put both of them together and got a shield. Regular armor looks cool on him and it's a good thing he has a gun. Price is good.",FALSE,5,5,4,4,5
"J6Crash","2011-09-08T17:09:17.597Z","Great colors and helmet","Can't really think of much of an intro so I'll get straight to it.<h4>Parts</h4>Gelu's got&nbsp; a few pretty sweet parts. The best piece is definitely the helmet, it's gorgeous. For once you can tell his tribe just from the helmet, thanks to those icicle things at the back. Next are the blade pieces, they are pretty nice as well. And rubbery. That's it for the new pieces. The Inika chest armor is recolored in white and may be useful. The only other parts that stand out are the snowflake shield pieces on his shoulders. They add a nice set of elemental affiliation, though I would have preferred them to have been white and blue rather than silver and blue. Other than that there are some useful white pieces and dark blue limb pieces.<br><h4>The build <br></h4>The build is just another Inika build with the extra on attaching those snowflakes on his shoulders. Boring and quick, in other words.<br>
<h4>The completed model <br></h4>Once built, Gelu looks pretty cool. The white on dark blue is a great color scheme and the helmet goes very nicely with the snowflakes. The Thornax launcher is a nice minimal projectile weapon that doesn't detract at all and I don't care how long Lego keeps using them.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Gelu is a pretty good set. Nothing particularly special, but the color scheme and helmet, snowflakes, and blades really come together well. I don't think he was worth all $13 USD, though. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if I could say that about any on the later Bionicle sets.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,2,5,3
