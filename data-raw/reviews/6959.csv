"Vrahno","2009-08-14T09:23:49.933Z","Most Brilliant!","Mata Nui! Toa Mata Nui, to be more precise.<br><br>Finally, Mata Nui, former Great Spirit and undoubtedly one of the most important characters in the whole Bionicle storyline, has arrived in set form! And I must say, he is an absolutely satisfying figure for a canister-sized set.<br><br>I love it, the colors, the overall design, armor, and tools... pardon me, weapons, they all look gorgeous on him. I don't care if he is not gold like in the new movie, his vibrant color combination of yellow and black is definitely to my liking.<br>I like the way the same piece is used as his shoulder armor as his Scarab Shield. I like the rounded piece serving as his thigh armor. I like how his ankle guards make his lower legs look more powerful and less skinny. I like the Krika/Onua Nuva chest armor on him. I like how even his crotch is covered with a piece. I like how the life-counter gear adds more bulk to his upper-body. I like his transparent-blue head. And I like the new Kanohi Ignika mold, even if it is tiny.<br><br>I dare say he is one of the best looking canister sets of all time.<br><br>So is there anything I don't like about him? The list is short, but I will elaborate, to make the review seem longer:<br><br>He has giant monkey-arms. I know nearly all of the canister sets have been suffering from this for years, but due to Mata Nui having shorters thigh than usual, his long arms reach way below his knees. I guess this isn't a crime, as there is no rule that says Bionicle character have to have totally human-like proportions, but his Titan sized version has more normal sized arms, compared to the rest of his body. Who is supposed to represent the same character in the same body.<br>But hey, at least his upper-arm pieces, the ones that are the main cause of his monkey arms, are new pieces, I can let it go.<br><br>Some have problems with how his ankle guards keep swinging from side to side, but I don't mind it, as they don't limit his foot movement that much and they make his legs more ""streamlined"" when posing, because they don't stick out to the sides of the legs.<br><br>One thing I would have liked the designers to add to him, though, was Click, the little friendly Scarabax beetle who transforms into his shield. It would be nice to see Click's face and eyes on his shield, like in the movie, but I assume the decision to have Click's face on it hasn't been made by the time the set was finalized. Or if it has, maybe they just couldn't find any suitable pieces. A pity.<br><br>And while we're at it, a sword wouldn't have hurt. He has one in the movie too.<br><br>His Inika-style build is nor revolutionary, nor original in the least. But it looks good. And at least they used pieces for his armor that haven't been overused yet.<br><br>Buy him. Go and buy him. Even if he is costy, he is worth the money. On top of all, he is Mata Nui. Ergo, a must for every worthwhile Bionicle fan that still collects the toys.<br><br>The pro and con list is basically unneeded here, but for the sake of completeness, here it is (the cons are minor ones):<br><br>Pros:<br>* He is Mata Nui<br>* Nice new Ignika helmet<br>* Cool new blade pieces<br>* If you like yellow parts, this set is for you<br>* New double-socket connector pieces, very useful for MOCers<br>* The life-counter gear is well placed, and doesn't take away anything from his design<br>* His overall look is good<br>* And can pose well<br><br>Cons:<br>* You may not like his loose ankle guards<br>* You may also find his helmet to be too small<br>* The overly long arms are more noticeable than usual<br>* No sword, only a Thornax launcher and his shield<br>* He is not gold colored<br><br>This was the objective pro and con list. My subjective one looks actually like this:<br><br>Pros:<br>* Everything, except for one thing:<br><br>Cons:<br>* His price tag almost made me cringe. But he is a lovely set, so I don't really mind it.<br><br>He gets a 5/5 from me.",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4
"Tri_pod_king","2009-11-27T17:59:57.263Z","Set #301. Would've done better as 300.","And finally, we have Mata Nui. The president. The king. The Great Spirit. You get the picture.
     I'll just get this out of the way: The shin guards are wiggly. Easy fix. I mention the solution in my Ackar review.
     And another thing: ENOUGH WITH THE THORNAX LAUNCHERS. The only dudes who have them in the movie were Vastus and Tarix. Instead, how about a sword for Mata Nui? Or a shield for Ackar? Meh, they still launch well.
     That aside, GET HIM. GET HIM BEFORE ANY OTHER LEGEND. SHORTLY FOLLOWED BY ACKAR. First of all, it's a perfect way to get the kanohi ignika: the mask of life. It might not be gold or silver, and definately a mini version- that's right, it's puny to fit the head- it still looks awesome.
     The skarabax shield- really nice, but it's just another weapon, rather than a skarabax beetle named click who transformed into it. It's still very nice, but maybe a purple piece with some green eyes would justify it.
     The main build: my main problem with this figure is that he's shorter than Ackar. You can blame that on the legs. I've tried making them longer, but then he just looks weird. Other than that, main build is very nice.
    I can't really think of anything else, but I felt I didn't really explain enough how this is a great figure.
    Conclusion: This is a must have for bionicle fans: it's Mata Nui for his sake! I highly recommend this figure.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"sger434","2009-08-21T10:22:30.42Z","a legend reborn","i got this set today (21st of august 09) for winning a competition which we did in school. the main points of this set:

colour: 
on the canister the armor pieces are goldish but the actuall armore pieces are a bright yellow colour which is a disipointment. there is some black parts in there so they go well together.

design:
very well done on figure there are some old pieces in there ( i cant remember which ones because my last bionicle set was way back when the hordika came out) the only downside about the design are the arms there just too big and skinny unlike the legs which are well armored. if hes holding the launcher then you cant straighten the arm properly when hes standing. the new hand pieces are great along with the new head instuctions and mask.

size:
very big for Â£8.99 apox 3 quaters of a 30cm ruler (without counting the arm plating) the arms are incredibly huge (they go down to his knee when straight) 

weapons:
the weapons are a thornax launcher and a scarab shield which you can spilt in 2 and use it as 2 seperate weapons. there is only 1 thornax in this set (should have 2 in case you lose it) you can replace the arm plates with teh scarab shield pieces and use it as an upgraded scarab shield.

overall:
very good, comes with lots of new pieces, mask in the yellow colour only in this set (the other 1 is golden i think) very big for Â£8.99 nice design, mask is amazing. score: 9.5/10 (5/5) ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

the other hand, had thought that he was never going to be made. When I saw that he was going to in January '09, I thought he would be a titan. But he comes out and looks great in his canister version. Better than Toa Mata Nui, definately. My only complaint is that the ankle-guards swing around. The Scarabax shield is great. You can make a yellow-orange version using the armor on his arms. I wouldn't have expected the light-blue head, but it looks great.

that he is a Glatorian.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"trewerd","2009-09-29T20:54:50.84Z","Mata Nui Awakens","Whoo boy, where do I begin with this guy. I like him. Just got him today and spent roughly 6 minutes building him. It is only after I'm finished that I realize, ""Wow... he's really yellow"" which isn't a bad thing. It's not like that many Bionicle sets are yellow.

Pros: 

-Looks very powerful, with extra armor plates on his ankles and large bladed armor on his shoulders. It's how I think Mata Nui SHOULD look.

-Highly posable. Me and my friends spent at least an hour making him do crazy poses. (Kamen Rider Kick, Falcon Punch, handstands, meditating, and Hare Hare Yukai, are some memorable ones). How posable is he? The soles of his feet can touch his face.

Cons: 

-He's missing the sword/dagger he had in the movie, and in it's place is a Thornax Launcher, this series's shooting weapon.

-He's very VERY yellow. I was kind of disappointed at how yellow he was. The first thing I did when my friends left was spray paint all of his yellow parts metallic gold, and now, in my opinion, he looks a lot better.

Final Verdict: 

-He's a good toy, fun to play with, worth the money.

-If the yellow throws you off, you could always paint it like I did.

-A scale of 1 - 10, He gets an 8. Good set, but nothing too spectacular.

"james3426","2009-11-03T18:01:32.67Z","""I will return.""","     Mata Nui is a cool ""Toa""/Glatorian. He has some problems though. My friend thinks the Kanohi Ignika screws him up completely, but I still like him. He is not the best, and greshmalum, I do not get why you think he is better than the big version.

      My major complaint is the fact that he does not have the sword as he has. It is replaced with a thornax launcher, which is a good launcher, but it is only for use in the action figure game. I have made a movie-version sword though, that involves these pieces: Scarab Shield half; two axle connectors; a size six axle; and a solid silver shark tooth blade. (in order from hilt to tip. Except for those axle connectors that go on each side of the axle.) Based on that, I think you can guess how they go together. Tell me in your reviews if you think it looks like the sword from the movie. 

     The scarab shield looks cool, but when I first saw Mata Nui earlier this year before he came out I looked at the weapon and thought, ""What kind of weapon is that?"" It did not look like a shield then or now.

     With the ankle armor, I forgot to mention my thoughts about how they move back and forth in my Ackar review, so I will do it now. I do not consider them a con because if they were stiff, they would limit pose-ability.

     The Kanohi Ignika is tiny compared to the 2008 version, but he looks really weird replaced with a Toa Metru head, and the Toa Mata Nui Ignika on him. I have come to the conclusion that they shold have designed a completely different Ignika that can fit on a Toa Metru head, but has a rounder bottom. This mask though, would look cool if it was not in helmet style and was bigger.

     By the looks of him, he is powerful with those shoulder blades and those Mahri armor plates as upper leg armor. Have you noticed that he is one of the first Bionicle sets to include keetorange Inika legs? I like this a lot! 

pros:
Many recolors.
Kanohi Ignika has a rounder design than 2008.
Scarab Shield looks cool.
Shield halves are plentiful.
Ankle armor.

cons:
Ignika is tiny.
He is short.
No sword.

"LEGOwikiguy","2010-02-05T16:13:48.06Z","Mata Nui uses beetle to destroy stuff...","I must say, this is my favorite Bionicle set (Probably tied with the Stars' Tahu). First, I must point out he is the legendary spirit; so, if you can pick only one Bionicle character to own, this is the one you should (Considering he is like the awesome guy).

I love the price: 52 Bionicle parts for $13-15 USD?! That's not bad at all! Really worth it too, playability wise. Price: 8/10

The set itself is amazing! The posability and beetle shield/sword is great, but so is the thornax shooter. Great job LEGO! Very similar to model from the movie, except he is more yellow than gold. Also, the armor on the side of the legs comes off sometimes (SOMETIMES! Not always, just if you are too rough with it). Model: 9/10

This set is very good when it comes to playability. However, a vehicle would go best with Mata Nui (Alone, not fun). The game is great! Especially for the new Bionicle fan who does not know all the Bionicle lingo. There are several poses, which make this set unique (Though sometimes he cannot hold himself up). Playability: 7/10

Well, I can't say the parts are all awesome. The head part underneath is the same old thing as before, looking just like a normal head. Thornax spike ball is not really new. The armor is the thing that keeps this above a 5/10, as well as the mask. Parts: 7/10

Building the set is not the easiest thing in the world, but not the hardest. I would not have a child under 8 (Unless they are very experienced with precise detail in Bionicle) build this by themselves. It does have a few challenging parts, but is still a fun build! Build: 8/10

All in all, when recorded, I guess it would be a 8/10, so a 4/5 (which is pretty good). I recommend this set to anyone who can find it! The game is fun, and it should be bought with another Bionicle set of the Glatorian Legends line. Hope this review helps all who want this beauty!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
