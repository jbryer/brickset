1. Slizer's ship.
One word to describe it, dinky.  It is a iny little ship that seems to be added because LEGO needed somthing to shoot the target.
________________________________________________________________

2. The cockpit/engines. 
These are noted together because they both detatch from the main ship and come to gether to form a nice little stealth ship. 
________________________________________________________________

3. The Prison pod and guns.
This is called max security transport for a reason.  When you press down on the pod, the guns pop up along with the side shields.  Another plus, when the pod is pressed down, the enemy ships cannot shoot the target because the part underneath it makes it so that it cannot move.
________________________________________________________________

4. The main body.
The body is very, very sturdy and does not fall apart.  The wheels are awesome and can roll over anything that you can dish out.  The flight mode is not what I thought it would be.  The picture on the box is small so it is hard to make out.  The wheels do not face forward, but rather downward so it is like a hover-craft.  Even though it is not what I expected, it is better.  The hover-wheels are each indipendent and that allows you to do things to the ship like barrel rolls and front flips.
________________________________________________________________

5. The build
The build is very simple and takes less than an hour but it is a very enjoyable hour.  The numbered bag system is divided into three sections this time, each building a little bit more of the ship.
________________________________________________________________

6. Minifigs
Snake is the most common minifig in the space police III line so nothing special there.  The police man looks very tough and looks like you don't want to mess with him.  Slizer is the coolest minifig here.  His face under the mask is not what you expect.  It is this crazy face with fangs and a whole evil look.

"krysto2002","2009-09-03T22:59:35.857Z","Not as bad as they all say.","This set has a few major features. First is the speeder with a missile launcher, second is the ship's transforming functions.

Main ship:

As for size, you aren't getting much. The VX-Falcon is about the same size (from hyperspace pursuit), and as for the part count, well let's say it could easily cost $35. Too many parts are wasted on design rather than usage.

The front cockpit is well designed, but the windshield doesn't fully come off. The transport is also very well armed with 10 blasters and the defense mode works very well. By pressing down on the prison pod, the shields and blasters raise, while the pod is locked into place, preventing it from opening.

The flight mode is alright, but is more of a hovercraft. The wheels also have a tendency to fold during motion on their own, but this acts as an all terrain suspension.

As with older sets, this one also has a detachable cockpit and booster, which combine into an escape craft. This is very reminiscent of older sets from series such as Space police II, both blacktrons and many other older modular sets.

Space bike:

One word: Small.
This makes for a terribly puny space craft, but from another angle, makes a great space bike, which is what it is supposed to be (they are a biker gang after all). They also included a technic launcher with it, which will definitely open the pod if you hit the target (or ""field generator""). This is a welcomed relief from the flick-fire missiles. The bike also has nothing to stand on other than its flat bottom, but legs could easily be added.

Summary:
The set could have easily been stripped of some of the unnecessary details to reduce the price, or enhance the overall set, but this is not the case. Also compared to older vehicles, this set is about the size of a $20 set.

Pros:
-Transforms easily
-Effective defense mode
-Modularity
-Again well detialed
-Two villains and one cop (who looks very tough)
-Two sets of handcuffs for two criminals
-Heavily armed
-Sturdy frame

Cons:
-Overly detialed
-Still too many stickers
-Pricey!!
-Tiny bike with no legs
-Small
-Pod may detach accidentally

"jkool","2010-01-07T22:43:18.857Z","An overpriced, poorly designed, flimsy Space Police III vehicle.","The Max Security Transport looks promising at first glance, but the box art can be deceiving much like the Gold Heist set.  The picture doesn't really give you a good idea of the overall small size and flimsy nature of the vehicle. 

In many ways, Max Security Transport a re-make of the Spy Trak 1 from the original Space Police theme.  I do have to commend Lego for using inspiration from older themes that many AFOL's grew up with.  I like this touch, but maybe Lego is limiting itself too much by trying to continually top itself.  In the Max Security Transport, they've taken the 4-wheeled prisoner transport concept of the Spy Trak 1 and ""upgraded"" it by having the wheels convert into a hover mode.  The mechanism for converting the wheels is simply a technic pin on a free-axis that falls down immediately once the vehicle is lifted.  This floaty nature of the vehicle makes it difficult to pick up or play with, a problem that the Gold Heist set also suffered from.

If you're familiar with the Spy Trak 1, you probably remember the high quality of the thick plastic wheels used in it.  The wheels in this set are the flimsiest ""wheels"" I've ever seen used on a Lego set.  This is a large step backward in overall quality of the set pieces and I feel it alone contributes to a lot of my disappointment with the set.

The design of the cock-pit itself is uninspired, although the inclusion of a real printed computer slope is a nice touch over a sticker computer panel.  There is not much structure to the frame of the vehicle itself.  Much like the Gold Heist, the picture presents a much better looking image of the vehicle than it will appear once you've built it.  

We're all familiar with the cheap enemy ships included in every set now, the worst offender being the tiny throw-away speeder in Gold Heist.  The Blackhole gang's ""space bike"" here is worthless, representing nothing more than an enormous and out of place spring launcher attached to a plate and a few bricks.  I'm certainly no fan of the ""conflict in a box"" concept that Lego has adopted in every single set, the additional pieces would be much better suited to reinforcing the main vehicle.

There are some nice features of this set that I did enjoy.  The engine is nicely built, though not nearly as detailed as the Hyperspeed Pursuit ship.  3 mini-figures, with a unique Space Police officer was nice to see.  The mechanism for pushing the jail cell into a locked position which raises the laser guns is nice, but the laser guns themselves just kind of ""flop"" around when not in a locked position.  Finally, you can detach the cockpit and engine and combine them to form a smaller craft, likely a design concept taken from other Space Police I and II ships.

Given all of the negative aspects of this ship, it is entirely overpriced at $39.99 USD.  However, if you can find it on sale or for a cheaper amount, it is still a nice addition to your collection - if only for completeness.

Pros:
- 3 minifigures and a unique police officer
- 2 sets of handcuffs, printed computer piece
- good, but small selection of pieces to use with SP3 moc's

Cons:
- Overpriced, too few pieces
- Cheap plastic wheels and flimsy design
- Enemy ""space bike"" is worthless

"Tanager","2009-11-21T21:44:33.48Z","Low on piece count, bit on the easy side buildwise, but fun playset","Summary: too few pieces for the price, high proportion of specialized pieces (wheels, engine intakes, technic cannon, e.g.) diminishes customizability, solid set once built, great play value, transform ability works well.

Details:  This set was a quick build.  A *really* quick build.  I doubt it took me more than 20 minutes, start to finish, and I wasn't really trying.  For nearly $40 USD, you get just over 330 parts, and the building is generally quite easy.  There are some other legitimate gripes.  The front canopy (and this is by *no* means unique to this set, this seems to be par across the majority of sets these days, so take my criticism with a grain of salt) has to be removed to insert a fig, and it doesn't come off that easily - the addition of just a couple of studs and tiles to raise it up and lessen the clutch factor would have helped here, and at a minimum of cost.  Also, the ""bike"" is really, really minimal.  Given the low, low piece count, surely TLG could have included something else - some fenders or sides to give it more of a cool look?  It's basically a technic cannon at one end, a motor at the other, and a plate in the middle.  Last, the set uses a disproportionately high amount of specialized parts (but that's true of a lot of recent space sets, I suppose), which diminishes ""replay value"" for me.

Having gotten the bad out of the way, here's the good.  Let's start off with a criticism others have raised that I don't think is valid.  I'm talking specifically about the inability to ""lock"" the wheels in place.  When you pick the set up, the wheels automatically rotate down to act as downward-facing thrusters.  You can't lock them into the ""wheel"" position while the vehicle isn't resting on the ground.  I don't think this is a problem in any fashion, personally.  If the vehicle isn't on the ground, it's presumably flying, and if so, those thrusters better be facing down, or gravity's gonna mess up your day, fast.  So to me, it's only natural that the wheels should rotate this way.  I think a locking mechanism (and I can think of several ways they could have done this) would have complicated the set unnecessarily and made it much more prone to breakage (as it is, it's a pretty solid set, so I'm glad they didn't go this route for multiple reasons).  As long as the set is sitting on the ground, the wheels aren't going to spontaneously rotate down into thruster mode, so to me, it's all good.

Now, I like the design generally.  The big, lugged wheels look right for a space vehicle.  I'm honestly not sure what else those parts could ever be other than big, honking space wheels, but c'est la vie.  I can live with that.  The locking mechanism for the prisoner capsule works and is pretty cool, particularly the way it raises up the outboard weaponry when it's engaged.  The modular design of the main vehicle, with the cockpit and rear thrusters disengaging to reform as some sort of...?escape? pod is nice and further enhances the playability (which is, IMHO, the best point to the whole set). 

IMHO, from an AFOL standpoint, this isn't a great build set.  Too few pieces, and too few pieces that you can reuse for other purposes.  But as a playset, it's topnotch, and sometimes that makes a set worth having.  In the morning, my son'll get up, and we'll have some great times clowning around with this one.  And it's an easy enough build that maybe I'll dismantle it and let him rebuild it, too.  A solid, if overpriced, effort, all in all.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"legoDad42","2010-01-01T19:23:11.873Z","Excellent Design!","Another wonderfully designed Lego Space Police vehicle. This vehicle is actually a combination 4 wheeler, paddy wagon, starship and shuttle craft. Loads of fun to play with and the build is fairly easy with just minor help your 6-7 year old on up can handle it. Here's the rundown below... 

PRO'S- 
Overall, it's a beautiful, uniquely designed craft. Great to look at in all angles. 4 extra large tires (made from 6 large tires) with big teeth/treads. Mounted to the middle is the 'jail pod/cell' which can hold a single bad guy. Back section has a nicely, designed engine. 

Cockpit/front section...can detach and attach itself to the rear/engine section (which also detaches) to form a shuttle craft. Good, fun play feature. And when attached, looks good and nicely designed. 

Mid section/jail cell...Top half of the cylindrical jail can come off to mount the prisoner inside. The set comes with 2 pairs to hand-cuffs to immobilize the baddie. You can raise the cell to open and put in the figure and then it tilts back. Now if you tilt it back all the way flat, you raise the shields and weapons mounted left and right of the vehicle. Looks good in this position and helps clear the firing lines of those lasers above the tires when it's a land vehicle.
 
Jail Cell...Right above the jail cell is a black target with a red technique pin in it's center. Now with this set comes a space bike riden by one of the baddies that has a spring loaded missile (rubber headed). You fire the missile to the jail cell's target...hit it...and it pops open the top half of the jail pod so your fellow goon can escape. The Jail Cell must be in the tilted position for this to work, not the fully flat position. The fully flat position protects the jail from opening as well as the raised shields protecting the craft. A nice touch Lego put into this set. 

Space bike...Simply design but looks neat with an engine block in the rear and the large spring loaded weapon at the front. 

Final feature...When you lift the entire Security transport off the ground, all four wheels tilt downward simulating a vertical take off simulating a hover craft or VTOL (verticle take off and landing). 

You also get 3 mini-figures...A Space Policeman (with two sets of handcuffs), Snake Eye and Slizer (great helmet on Slizer). Note the Space Policeman and Snake Eye have tilting visors on their helmets. 

CON'S- 
Front cockpit looks great but the windshield doesn't have a hinge to open and close it. It snaps on. Which is fine but Lego could've easily designed for the hinge like on other Space Police vehicles. No biggie...you can modifiy it if you wish. Still looks great either way. 

When lifting the transport, not all the tires tilt downward. You have to move some of them into position. I've found that over time, since the parts are new, they stay in place initially but loosen up eventually so all four tires tilt together when lifted. 

Wish all 3 mini-figures had hand held weapons. 

Final quibble...The independent suspension of the tires is sturdy but when in car mode the tires tilt inward slightly. Meaning not all four axles stay level to the ground. Again, not a biggie, just tilt the wheels so they are flush to the ground. Oh, also...the wheels roll best on carpet or couch or bed. Any surface too smooth won't make the tires spin as much. 

I'd recommend this set despite some of the 'con's'. It looks great, fun and easy to build plus loads and loads of play features to keep you and your kid occupied. For the adult collector an excellently designed vehicle and great addition to the Space Police line. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"P13c30fch33s3","2010-05-27T04:43:11.5Z","An excellent craft, whether complete or split apart","<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><p>This set is the only set focused around a wheeled vehicle in SPIII so far. Despite the wheels, it is an excellent set.</p><h4>Minifigures:</h4><p>The minifigures are not that bad. Slizer looks very threatening with his spiky helmet, just like Snake. Underneath the helmet, however, Slizer looks very silly with a strange face. Luckily, only the eyes are exposed by the slit in the helmet. However, even without the helmet, Snake looks very menacing with his multiple eyes and his teeth. The SP officer isn't quite as impressive. This is because Only his head is unique, and it isn't a two sided face. I also don't like the helmet as much, unlike the new SP Commando helmets.</p><h4>The missile armed speeder:</h4><p>This part of the set is quite a let down, as it look pathetic and doesn't stand a chance against the Max Security Transport (MST). I think the only reason for this to be in the set is to shoot at the target on the prison pod. However, I would happily pay more for an improved speeder that looks good.</p><h4>The Front + Back of MST:</h4><p>These sections of the MST are fairly good, and together form a fairly neat escape pod (albeit with multiple weapons). The cockpit has a sloped piece with a controls print on it. This piece is also found in the Galactic Enforcer. i think the only criticism of teh cockpit is that you cannot put an SP officer with an airtank in because there is no space. Although the two side guns are raised and look awkward, it is for holding it in place on the body of the MST. The jets are nicely designed, even though they have less mini jets connected than the VX Falcon in Hyperspeed Pursuit (4 compared to 8 per engine). It also has two small folding wings that add wings to the escape pod. Together, the pod looks brilliant (to me at least) and is a key highlight of the set.</p><h4>The Body of the MST:</h4><p>This is where the majority of the pieces is in. Multiple long parts form and support a frame, with extra parts to add details. The centre is hollow, to allow the prison pod to pivot about. On the side, there are two gun pods, which pivot up when the prison pod is pushed down. The prison pod cannot be opened when pushed down. On the piece that holds the side gun pods, there are two armour like pieces which, from certain angles, protect the pod from fire. However, when the gun pods are down, they would fire through the front wheels. Apart from these parts, there are pieces to hold the wheels on the MST. I feel that there is a lack of parts in the centre of the MST. I would happily pay extra for more pieces in the body, like the missile speeder.</p><h4>'Flight Mode'</h4><p>The 'flight mode' is in fact when the four wheels (eight wheels parts, actually) flip down and appear to act like the jets on a Harrier jump jet, although being a lot larger than a Harrier's rotating jets and also possibly a lot more clumsy. I think that the flight mode should have been imrpoved, even if it would cost more, because it improves the way the MST looks in flight mode.</p><h4>Overall:</h4><p>Despite having a few flaws, I think that it is a fairly good compromise, and that the MST is a good set. I recommend this, although there are other sets that are better and have less flaws.<br></p><ul><li><br></li></ul>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"Cyborg_Phloyd","2010-02-10T20:18:55.31Z","Far Better Than I Expected!","I've been pursuing the Lego Space Police III sets to complete the collection. I've reviewed every one I have so far. What made me rush to get this one was that it was no longer available in any toy stores or Lego.com. I managed to nab one of BrickLink for a decent price. I've got to say that I wasn't necessarily looking forward to this one because of several things, but I as utterly surprised.

PROS
As in every other review of mine of the SPIII toyline, I just love the minifigures. The Space Police Officers have a great look to them. I just prefer that they come with airtanks, but they don't in this one. It's still not a big issue though. The alien criminals are excellent too. Snake, though extremely common, has a thuggish, rugged look to him. This was also the first set I got that had Slizer in it. I was surprised when I built him, because his helmet was partially rubbery, and from the side the helmet didn't look quite the way I had pictured it. But these are not complaints! Slizer still looks great!

This was also the first set I got that included a ""prison pod."" I had heard great things about the Prison Pod ""breakout"" features and was looking forward to testing them out for myself. Not at all to my surprise, I loved it! It's a brilliant system Lego came up with; it makes you have a good time aiming and outright blowing the pod up, saving your criminal buddy! On occasion it doesn't work perfectly, but it's still such a blast. I also like the little caption on the Prison Pod sticker ""May contain alien atmosphere."" It's just great!

Another great feature of this set is that you can raise and lower the side laser weapons. What this set does is simple but effective; you press down the prison pod, and it pushes up the laser cannons. My guess is that LEGO was intending this to be a kind of ""high security function"" because in this mode, the Prison Pod is pretty well secured in place with those lasers raised up. And if you want it back to normal, it's just as easy, just press the knob on the prison pod upward and it lowers the lasers. It just works.

The last thing about this set is an aspect I never really embrace much, but a lot of other people who are LEGO Space fans do. The back thrusters of the Mas Security Transport can be detached. The front cockpit of the vehicle can also be detached. Like many other ancient, past LEGO Space ships and machines, you can make a miniature ship by connecting these two parts together. I've tried it and it works quite smoothly; I just don't really use that ability much.

CONS
One of the touchier aspects of this set is its ""flight mode"" ability. Some fans think it's incredible, others not so much. To me, I don't mind having the wheels act as hover-devices, simply because the bars on the sides of the wheels look like they cover up very large fans, making it look believable that the wheels could propel the machine through the air. My issue with the set is the method in which the Max Security Transport transitions between driving and flying mode. The axles of the machine rest on rather loose bars. This is really fine when in driving mode, but when you go to flight, you just watch the wheels swing down, sometimes they don't even go down so you need to push them down yourself. Its also a bit of a pain bringing it back to driving mode, because you have to flip up all of the wheels to land it. I think that if LEGO included some sort of lever mechanism that you could use to turn or move the wheels between modes, it would've been perfect.

Also, I doubt few will disagree with me that the alien vehicle is despicable! The ship is apparently propelled by one, VERY tiny engine about the size of the ""Space Speeder"" set's engine. The ship has a clunky design and just is stupid looking IMO. I guess LEGO needed to put in some kind of blunt launcher to make use of the Prison Pod feature. But come on! Couldn't they have made the ship a little more convincing, or maybe make the blunt launcher stationary, like a turret?

One more minor Con is that large wheels on the set don't move very well over flat, smooth surfaces, and are better suited to carpets. That in itself truly though is fine because the wheels are meant to be heavy duty and to be used on ""rugged"" terrain, not stable smooth terrain.

This set blew my expectations. The set proved far more entertaining that I had imagined and some of the set's features are quite remarkable. IMO, it's still well worth your money; that is, if you can FIND it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"vynsane","2010-01-17T12:44:56.56Z","cool action features and great nostalgia","As a kid, LEGO Space was my favorite theme, and within that theme my absolute favorite sub-theme was Blacktron 1, followed closely by Space Police 1. Having just come back into the scene some nearly 20 years after supposedly 'growing up', I was elated to see the cool new Space Police 3 sets. I was lucky enough to find this set on the 'sale' rack at my closest LEGO store, so bear that in mind - I might not have found as much value for $40 as I do for $30.

The reason why I bring up my fondness for Blacktron as well as Space Police is because this set conjures up nostalgia for both of those series - SP1 directly by being a continuation thereof and BT1 because of the modular nature of the main vehicle, which was one of the most distinct features of BT1. I grinned ear-to-ear when I realized that the front cockpit section and rear engine section disconnected from the main vehicle frame and reconnected to form (what I view as) a light chase vehicle, used to intercept the secondary vehicle after either villain (Snake or Slizer) is rescued from the containment pod situated in the middle of the main vehicle by a (very well placed) missile shot to the round black dish. This already sets a high mark for playability.

The two 'action features' are hit and miss - the 'hover conversion' is rather cheap, as noted in other reviews, with the wheels merely hanging down below the undercarriage of the main vehicle. The other feature, however, is top-notch - by pushing the containment pod all the way down, you activate 'attack mode' which doubles to secure the target of the pod in place, preventing escape of the detainee, while bringing the two large guns to bear. It's this type of articulation that reminds me of the original Space Police four-wheel transport, the Spy Trak 1 with its steering mechanism. Very cool.

The villain's ride is not much to speak about, as again noted in other reviews. the engine is cool looking enough and the missile launcher is actually impressively strong, but other than that it's a few antennae/control sticks and a 2x6 black plank holding it together. Not as cheap as the secondary vehicle from, say, 'Gold Heist', but not all that great. 

Overall, if you can find it for the price I did, I don't think you'll be disappointed. You get a cool vehicle, two villains, and two sets of handcuffs.

The set came with enough extra parts to put a set of red and blue cheese wedge lights on top of the cockpit canopy - I found once you put together the chase vehicle, there were no lights on it what-so-ever, so thought it appropriate. I also placed the sticker above the pilot/driver's head as opposed to where it's placed on the photo, as it seemed to perfectly obstruct the forward view of the figure seated therein. I also angled all the wedges (red, white, blue) that appear around the target in the same orientation following the slope of the bricks below it. I found the recommended jagged saw-tooth orientation jarring. Of course, the fixed canopy on the cockpit is a bit of a drag, but not a huge problem. A hinge would've been nice, and with a few mods can be taken care of. The big plastic wheels would've been nice in rubber, but also not a deal-breaker.
