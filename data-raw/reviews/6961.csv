Perfect for home defense.","I bought this set last week at TRU and when i built it i thought it was pretty cool with all the tools and functions of a repair garage but can also be used to stand off the space police. Although it is a small garage there is a lot of things you can do in it.

Some of the cool features are the missiles hidden behind the sign, exploding barrels (just like in the video games sort of), the tool rack that revolves into a gun rack, some hidden dynamite, and a secret stash of gold (im not telling were it is). The only problem is the vehicle lift. every time i put a lite vehicle on there it moves down. Eh cant win em all.

overall this is a really good set and i strongly recomend it if you go to TRU and you have the money.

So when i got home i poured all the bags into one container (I regret it,so don't do this with big 389 piece sets)and let my sister play with the figs and vehicles.By the time I got through half of the second booklet I had to get ready for judo.When I got back home,I stayed up till 10:00 to finish it.This will be a more detailed review.

"JBH75","2009-08-13T14:56:06.373Z","Have a Pit-Stop!!","I got this set a few weeks ago, but because of my Summer vacation I couldn't post my reviews. Anyways, this set is Limited Edition, and that's definitely the case here. This set includes a lot of mini-figs, accessories, and above all, playability. Here's my pro/con list.

Pros:
Skull Twin (Double-Sided Face), Snake, Squiddy, and a Space Cop
Awesome Alien and Space Police Ship
Tools, dynamite, Gold bars, Rat, and Barbed Wire
Flick-Fire hidden missiles (behind the sign)
""Exploding"" Nuclear Waste Barrels
Rotating Tool Wall

Cons:
Stickers!!
Snake (He is so Common!!)
Vehicle Platform doesn't hold up under heavy weight of Lego ships

This set is definitley worth the money, or at least slightly not worth it. You really tinker around and explore this set's playability. BTW: I definitely recommend combining the spaceships included in this sets for building MOCs (I put the police cruiser and the ship from the Gold Heist together, ""Beware Frenzy!!"")

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2009-10-25T02:52:29.7Z","VERY LENGTHY REVIEW: I feel the set needs a complete analysis.","This is my lengthy review of the special edition set. It's lengthy because I have a lot to report on and I think it deserves analytical attention. Oddly, this special edition set was my first Space Police III set. What exactly caused me to get interested in the toyline, I'm not certain. But I remember that the image in my bimonthly Lego catalogue intrigued me and got me to buy it. I like the set a lot, but it does have some quirks.

PROS:
One of the biggest reasons I'm such a passionate fan of LEGO is the minifigs, and the Space Police III toy line has some great minifigs! Every Space Police officer looks great, (I just don't like how the helmets don't completely cover the head but they look great just as well).The alien criminals are great too. Squidman has a great sort of ""maniac"" look to him.  Snake is a wicked figure due to his greatly designed helmet (that truly only looks good with the black visor on). And the Skull Twin is by far one of my favorite minifigs LEGO has ever released simply because of the helmet (though the torso and legs are great too).

The pit-stop itself was a great addition to the toy line because it gives the Black Hole Gang and its affiliates a place to rest and repair their ships and vehicles. The pitstop has 3 spray-paint cans, 7 different tools for maintainence on ships, a hidden safe of gold, 2 barrels of some kind of radioactive liquid, hence the symbol atop them (my guess fuel for the aliens' vehicles I mean c'mon, they're aliens! Radiation don't hurt em! XD) and a hidden rack of three laser guns and a flick-fire rocket launcher held by a minifig. The great thing about the weapons rack is that it is on the other side of the main tool rack, and a knob can be turned to flip between the two sides. There's also a cart with dynamite and a mug that seemingly belongs to Squidman. Another great thing about the base is the flick-missile rack. It's hidden behind the pitstop sign, and by flipping it you have a flick-missile rack with 4 missiles! And for added playability, the large window of the pitstop can be moved up.

Snake's vehicle, though rather small, is a sweet ride. It's clearly a fast thing, with those huge twin turbines on its sides. The machine also has exhaust pipes placed well on it. In the back are two pistol pieces. Whether or not they are intended to be weapons for Snake or a second set of exhaust pipes, I don't know. The ship even has a laser cannon at the front!

CONS:
One of the big cons about this set are the vehicles, save Snake's ship. First is the Space Police flyer vehicle. On the box image, it shows that the flyer has laser weaponry, yet nowhere on the finished model do you see any type of guns whatsoever. The flyer is a disappointing aspect of the set, partly because it looks so great from the view of it on the box. The flyer actually isn't airtight, with a gaping hole right below the windshield. I think if that were fixed it would've been a near-perfect vehicle.

The alien gangsters' vehicles (except Snake's) aren't great either. First off, the Skull Twin's rover type vehicle's chassis is so slanted that it practically scrapes the ground it drives on. Also, he can hardly see in front of him with the giant spike roofing smack in his face. Squidman was apparently assigned a vehicle (odd since LEGO says he prefers running on foot). The vehicle itself is great in design, but is hardly compatible with Minifigs who drive it, let alone the caped Squidman. It's extremely cramped, and you must either bend Squidman's cumbersome cape in near-damaging ways or plain-out take it off. Aside form that, Minifigs are a pain to fit inside the thing, and even harder to remove! 

The pitstop isn't perfect either. Boy, I would love to repair my ships at the pitstop, but when I put them on the maintainence platform, the platform can't hold them up! In order to get it to stay, you will have to play around with it in ways I doubt are intended. Also, the pitstop has some kind of fuel tank, but you can't connect it at all to any of the vehicles, and even if you somehow did, the tank flies up in the air because it isn't very stable, if you can picture that.

I think everyone should know that IMO ""Squidman's Pit-Stop"" is still a worthwhile set to buy. I got loads of play out of it despite its downsides, and had a blast with the great figures. You truly can do a lot with this set and is a great set to add to a Space Police III collection or in my case, begin one! 4/5 final score!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
