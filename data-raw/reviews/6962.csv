"Harm1","2009-05-29T15:46:44.263Z","Nice little set","Pros:
- Really cool space police-dog, could be adapted to skeleton dog with minor changes. 
- Quite a few special pieces
- 3 spare pieces

Cons:
- Helm visor comes of really easily

The lovely dog and special pieces make this one of the better small sets of 2009 in my opinion. Definately worth the money. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MayTheBricksBeWithYou","2009-06-03T14:49:44.34Z","Woof woof!","I picked this one up as a nice 'foreplay' for the major sets this year. And it's very nice indeed. The dog has a nice robot feel to it, but still got the looks of a real dog. Very nicely done!

The agent is a great new minifig with prints all over, nice helmet with a genuine police feel visor. The gun is a bit cheap, but seeing the overall picture I understand the choice. 

I must point out that the dog doesn't stay well together. When you adjust the feet it breaks apart all the time. But as I only use it to display, I don't really care. But it could be annoying if you're really want to play with it. 

Overall very nice set with some great parts and a great minifig! (Actually two!). ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"EXO_FORCE","2009-09-17T03:29:10.56Z","Short review!","I bought this set 2-3 weeks ago... Really a nice little impulse from SP3 series.

First to mention is the extra part. It gives an extra trans red slope, round trans blue brick and a visor, which is quite rare for me. Besides, the bot is come along with 2 droids body piece and 4 Exo-Force styled mechanic finger in white. For e, it is a quite good set between the ratio of money and parts. 

In short:
Pros
Rare parts - Mechanic arm, droid body, helm
Trans pieces
Nice torso.

Cons
The facial expression looks quite boring for me... Maybe some new PM's face?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Yloquen","2009-06-22T17:32:52.077Z","Good impulse set.","I was wondering if the new space police minifigs would be to my liking, and when I saw the one from this set my doubts disappeared. 

The minifig - Cool face, torso printing on both sides, nice oxygen tank worn on the back, futuristic looking weapon, and the best thing is the helm - the visor is shiny black which looks very nice. 

The dog - the dog is really fantastic looking. The bright white with the transparent reds and blue is great combination. Its design is smart though it is a bit prone to breaking at the front and back blue studs which hold the legs. It is very posable. I like it so much that I will keep it intact, instead of disassembling it and putting it to my parts bin, as I do with almost everything that is not a minifig.

The original design of the dog has one problem - the head is in the way of the missile. I modified it by attaching the head to the lower bar. I think it looks cooler this way and also the missile is way more usable in this setup.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"P13c30fch33s3","2009-09-21T02:56:12.483Z","Neat Little Set","This set is useful for making robots (take apart the Bot) and army building because of its cheap price.

Space Police Officer:
Pretty much identical to all other officers except he has a gun, he has a different face, and he has airtanks/jetpack (some don't)
Good for filling up the Galactic Enforcer or for fighting the Wrecker Space Truck. He has a classic style gun. Although we are in the age of advanced lego, I think it was a good choice because it is like a tribute to classic lego.

K-9 Bot
Very biologically correct. Has four legs (like a canine/dog), has a head (like pretty much all animals, insects etc).
The Flick-fire launcher on his back is good, although you should move his head to the bottom bar (like a battle droid's head; take a look at a lego battle droid) for best performance

Pros:
Cheap
Good army builder
Officer has full gear (equipment)
Flick Fire rocket

Cons:
K-9's head must be moved for best performance

Overall: Get this set. It is good for mixing minifigs and making armies.
Also good for making a ship look more full (e.g. Galactic Enforcer)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StealthNinja999","2009-10-29T15:34:02.06Z","K-9 Bot","I got this along with Space speeder and it is really worth the money. It is a cheap way to get a fully equipped space officer.

Pros
-Useful parts, e.g. white Battle Droid Torsos, oxygen tanks
-Police officer has printing on both sides of his torso and has printed legs
-Missile works well, it adds some playability to the set

Cons
-The dogs head sometimes gets in the way when firing the missile
-The gun is weird
-This set is pretty boring on it's own

Overall I would get this set as it is rare and is a cheap way to boost your police force.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

*(US $2,000 s/h)

What's also great is what the dog is made of. Star Wars droid torsos and Exo-Force robot arms. The arms are the real reason to buy this set. With those you can make some good old robot hands for your Mecha MOC and those torsos make good arm/leg joints for some extra poseability when you have those hook bricks lying around. Buying at least two of these should be sufficient for that.

Then there's the cop. With a space-type pop gun. I can easily say this is a nice bonus and he can be a part of a human army. What bothers me though, is the helmet. It looks like those old-timey US football helmets with a visor unnecessarily clipped to the front. They shoulda just used those bike helmets or make something that didnt look like an old-timey US football helmet.

There's also that missile launcher on the dog. If you flick it, it goes about almost half a foot away, least mine does. 

And that's all there is to it. It's a CHEAP set with very useful pieces and cheap enough to buy more than one. So when you go grocery shopping, you can throw this one in your cart on impulse :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The reasons the dog is not too good is because it does not want to stay together at the technic peice that holds the flick fire missle.  And, speaking of the missle does any one like those things.  I will admight to dog does look nice the only plus for the thing.  I real do not have much to say about the cop just a regular mini figure.  ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Cyborg_Phloyd","2009-11-03T19:49:23.873Z","Nearly Flawless!","K9-Bot, along with the Space Speeder, is the smallest set in the entire SPIII toy line. Why do I love it so much? 

PROS
Like I've said in every SPIII review I've done, I praise the Minifigs in the sets very highly. The Space Police Officer minifigures are just great, period. My only qualm with the overall figure is that occasionally in SPIII sets, the officers do not have airtanks. This however, is not the case in this set; you get a fully equipped Space Police Officer, and even a hand tool, which I suspect is a laser gun. 
The K9-Bot is definitely the feature of the set, hence the name. Also, however, the K9-Bot was built out of a small amount of pieces and a very simple design, and its so simple, you can see the whole thing in the picture! Its an excellent model!

CONS
My only cons with this set is the main torso of the K9-Bot, which occasionally falls off. Also, the K9-Bot doesn't have a tail, but it doesn't really need one because its a robot. I won't get the set down about the flick-rocket system; I feel it's perfectly acceptable. But even these cons are small!

This is why I love the set. It comes with a fully equipped Space Police Officer and a great little robot doggie! Plus it's immensely simple, enjoyable, and very cheap! Even if you aren't a fan of SPIII, you should still pick one up! 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoDad42","2010-01-17T15:17:15.687Z","Great mini-set!","Great little Lego Space Police mini-set. Simple, easy build. 

PRO's-Space Policman mini-figure with blaster, jet-pack(or oxygen tanks?) on back and helmet with movable visor. K9-Bot has flick fire missile on back. 

CON's-None really for such a small, little starter set.

"vexorian","2010-02-27T14:03:26.467Z","Nice design","<p>I really like the whole concept of a police dog droid for space police. And I love the dog's design since no new mold was necessary for this novelty. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Minifig: He is nothing you won't see on any other space police 3 set. But he comes with oxygen tank and &quot;gun&quot; (I think it is actually a sound amplifier since the dog possibly does most of the job).</li>
    <li>Parts: This is my favorite part as this set comes with plenty of special parts. Two droid torsos, four exoforce arms, but what's better is that it has about 3 great backup pieces. The sloped red light a trans-blue pin and, most importantly the black visor, having spares of this visor is great because I will be able to restore my old blacktron fig...</li>
    <li>Buiding experience: Good for an eager 5 years old. More experienced people might find it boring.</li>
    <li>Design: The design of the dog is, like I mentioned very nice. It manages to stay simple, look good and even comes with flicker missile.</li>
    <li>Playability: Really, for an impulse set it has so many possibilities, the dog is a nice fig and has a flicker fire missile you can shoot. It also has a companion fig.</li>
    <li>Value for money: Most people say it is expensive. But consider that most of the pieces are of the more special kind and well, yet I found it at 3.2~ USD at my local store which usually charges something more than the retail pricem and I find this set worth it, it is not really a good deal but it is a decent one, 4/5. If you find it on ebay at something crazy like 4+ dollars then avoid it. </li>

I recommend buying this with something such as Squidman's escape. The K-9 bot is pretty sturdy, though the body may break in half.

This gets a 3/5 because, even though small, the K-9 goes well with another SP3 set. I do recommend this set, bought with another.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>K-9 Bot is a Space Police 3 Impulse Set and it involves building up a robotic police dog out of pieces we've seen plenty of in the Star Wars sets. But now they're in new colors.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is worth getting. It is fun and unique and if you can get more than one because a few K9 Bots to help enforce the Space Laws is always good in my book. And the Space Police Officer is generic enough to represent a bunch of rookie cadets or something.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Small box with nice art. Instructions came in the form of one piece of paper, so no booklet</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Rather interesting parts, several quite rare ones are used for the dog, plus several transparent round tile 1x1 and slope 1x1.</p>

<p>1 SPIII Minifig, with helm+visor and some kind of gun.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Easily build, 5 minutes tops. Quite fun to find the best angle for the dog's feet.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Scary-looking dog and a policeman with gun seems enough to chase runaway criminals. Not to mention the flick-fire missile on it's back, the dog is way cool!</p>

He is not double-sided. He has a great black helmet with a black visor that blocks off his face. He also has the standard Space police uniform. Great set, pretty cheap, worth it.

"AETerry","2011-04-27T19:50:37.27Z","K-9 Bot Review","<p>In comparison to the other small Impluse buy set from the Space Police 3 theme, the K-9 Bot set is well worth getting. My only real regret, is while though I bought two, I didn't get back to the store in time to buy more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call me a Literary buff in this respect, but the robotic dog has me thinking of the robotic dog in the novel Farenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. And yes the book, not the movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build for the dog is a bit flimsy, it seems to want to break apart constantly, but the ingenuity of it for a set this size, it doesn't bother me too much. The other thing in this set as clearly seen is the Space Police minifigure who accompanies the K-9 Bot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well worth it, I'm hoping to snag more pieces to create and build more of these little bots, they were rather fun and amusing to build.</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,5
