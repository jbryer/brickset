"1__Lego","2009-09-16T23:29:51.67Z","Not that good at all...","This set comes with a speeder and 1 minifig.

Pros: 

cool helmet

blaster gun looks sweet

no visor for the helmet

minifig is one of the ugliest most demonic creature things Lego has ever made

a minifigs hands cant fit properly on the handle bars

"P13c30fch33s3","2009-12-16T07:44:29.653Z","Snake? Snake?! HAHAHAHAHAHA SNAKE!","By the title, I am referring t fear he should inspire in people...until they see what he is piloting.

Snake:
Snake is simply a minifig with an unusual helmet. I find it quite good though.
His face is actually a mono-eye and brow with multiple extra eyes on the side. He also appears to have an eye in his chest...weird. This version of Snake doesn't have a black visor on his helmet.
Pros:
 - Helmet
 - Intimidating
Cons:
 - Most common alien

Random Ship:
The small thing looks like Frenzy's Space Hopper without the ability to steal vaults. It uses a relatively new piece for a gun.
Pros:
 - Gun piece
 - Flame
 - Pocket sized
Cons:
 - Very small
 - Doesn't look like a spaceship
 - Not particularly balanced

Other Stats (e.g. price, size, etc):
 - Expensive for 14 pieces
 - One minifig
 - Colours fit with other Space Biker vehicles

Opinion:
This is great for building up a Snake army. However, it is not worth it if you are looking for just pieces - there aren't many.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"StealthNinja999","2009-10-29T15:21:41.39Z","Space speeder","I got this along with K-9 bot and it is a good set with one minifig, Snake. I know he is quite common but this is the first time I got him so that is why this set gets a five.

Pros
-Cool Snake minifig
-Nice pieces e.g. telescope, flame, gun piece
-Very cheap
-Cool helmet

Cons
-The blue Technic pin on the back is visible

I would only recommend this if you don't have snake already or you are a hardcore space police fan, It is quite rare however and comes with some nice parts but the K-9 Bot is just a little bit better.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2009-12-30T21:30:08.967Z","Waaaay Too Overpriced","Okay, this guy does have a nasty, criminal face and his speeder looks quite a blast, but the price is certainly too high.

Box : 5/5
Evil-looking yellow guy is seen riding his speeder with some SP II background and CGI effects.

Instructions : 3/5
Just basic impulse instructions (paper, not booklet)

Building : 3/5
I built this set inside the plastic, so it's quite an experience. However, I suppose it wouldn't be so fun when you build it outside the plastic.

Playability : 3/5
There's hardly anything you can do with this one. Perhaps if you have the other SP II impulse, you can create a pursuit scene (although it's really a hard race, Speeder VS Dog-Bot :D)

Compare With Price : 1/5
I'd like to give this section a half score, actually. In Indonesia, this set is priced for IDR 59,900 which is equal to US$6.37. I think it's very expensive for such a little amount of pieces. Maybe the minifig makes this set over-priced.

Overall : 3/5
A set to buy when you didnt't have enough money to buy the larger ones, or if you want to complete your SP II or Impulse collection. Packs quite a punch with the minifig, but the speeder is standard.

Pros : 
Nice minifig
Rare minifig headgear
No sticker

Cons : 
Over-priced
Too few pieces

Snake is a very cool minifigure, although i don't know why they left the black visor off in this set.

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2009-12-19T14:35:18.03Z","Flawed, but worth the tiny price","I picked up Space Speeder a while ago at TRU. Oddly, it was the last one on the shelves, whereas its counterpart set, ""K-9 Bot"" was in plentiful supply. I gotta say, with these impulse sets, u can at least know almost in total what you're buying just from the picture because they're so small and simple. However, unlike my high praise of ""K-9 Bot,"" Space Speeder is not quite as impressive. Still, I love SPIII, and I just had to grab one of these sets. They're so cheap too!

PROS
Again, every one of my SPIII reviews truly praises the Minifigs. THey're so detailed, with every fig having a printed backside to their torso and overall unique, varying, and enjoyable looks to all of them. Snake is one of my favorite criminals in SPIII and its just always a pleasure to look at these great figures after they're built. I also like the laser cannon feature on the Space Speeder. Being attached to the steering handles makes it look very believable. It's also quite big for the set, but without looking cumbersome. This likely means that this little craft has quite the firepower for its size.

CONS
I don't exactly like how the set has no real ""seat,"" with Snake just hanging onto the handles for support. I think it would've been better if LEGO just threw in a car seat or SOMETHING. Despite how much I love SPIII minifigures, in this set you get Snake, but without a black visor! The black visor is part of the reason Snake looks so good! I cannot think of many good reasons as to why this set has no black visor! Perhaps because its an impulse set, but heck, even that doesn't explain to me why it's left out! Oh well, the good thing is that any set that come with a Space Police officer offers an extra black visor piece so you can certainly put that on this set's Snake model.

A long review for a tiny set. Again, I do this because I love LEGOs and I love SPIII. I like to share my opinions about these sets in particular. My opinion; if you like the series, get the set. Its got enough pirks. 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"bajadogq","2010-03-09T20:44:49.297Z","The Worst Set I Own!","I'll start off by saying that I would <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">NEVER</span> buy this set with my own money. I got it as a gift. I would also like to say the Snake is the single ugliest minifig of all time. Most other reveiwers are complaining by saying that he does not have a visor. So, I put one on, and was not happy with the result. The only good thing about the visor is that it covers Snake's hideous face (though he can still stare at you with that ugly eye in the middle of his torso).<br><br>Onto the vehicle- well, it's too small to be called vehicle. In fact, I bet a senior space man's hover-chair has more meat than this. This thing just horrid!<br><br>Don't buy this set! Don't even look at it!

"smarty","2009-12-28T01:25:13.983Z","Too small for the price and for the box!","I was stoked when this one showed up at my local Toyworld, stoked until I opened the box and realised how small the set was!
Come on Lego, there should have at least been a helmet visor or an extra weapon.  Maybe some money like in Squidman's Escape?
In any event this set could have been so much more just by adding a couple of extras.
The 'Space Speeder' looks OK but is very small, it should be called the 'Space Scooter.'
I wonder is Lego slowly introducing sets with less and less until all we get is a single minifig in a box? 14 pieces is very light on and seriously overpackaged, 90% of the box volume was air!
The minifig itself is very cool, but as I mentioned he needs a helmet visor, another weapon and some stolen cash or gold.

When you consider a standard minifigure goes for $2.99 (at least at the build-a-figure bar at a LEGO Store) paying LESS than that makes it a bargain. Even at the original $3.50, it means you get the pieces to build the vehicle for $0.51!

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-28T15:26:14.013Z","Evil Snake is speeding away?","<p>Set #8400 Space Speeder: Why LEGO why? I really want to like this set and in a way I guess I do, but in all honesty paying full price for this Impulse set is a big no-no in my book. Fundamentally there isn't really anything <strong>wrong</strong> with this set. It gives you a cheap way to pick up the Snake Alien Mini-Figure, and it includes something to build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The flaw however is the dollar to piece value of the set. I could build a similar vehicle for Snake out of the left-over parts I get from buying up larger sets, plus a few spares from my childhood, if you're going to make a little LEGO Speeder the least you can do is make it look like... Well anything really. That's the big problem with the Space Speeder set, it doesn't look like anything. It's like Marvel Comics Modok, only he's flying around in his underwear or something instead of the cool floating armor he has.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's included with a lot of Space Police 3 sets or the entire first year's worth of sets then I say great, but if you're looking for a way to get the Snake Mini-Figure, it'd probably be easier just to pay for the figure alone rather than this. (On the plus side, with the spare visor from K-9 Bot you can give Snake his visor, which he should have come with in the first place.)</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3
