<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The most obvious pro to this set is a white horse!&nbsp; There are precious few horses in LEGO City (this one and the one in the Farm 4WD w/ Horse Trailer).&nbsp; If you want a farm, a mounted police office, a horse drawn carriage... you'll need a horse and this is one way to get one.&nbsp; The set also include a female minifig, which is almost as rare as a horse!<br></li><li>Secondly, you get a lot of great accessories like a gold goblet, two transparent dark pink cups, a saucepan, and a hairbrush.&nbsp; The set also includes two windows with rounded tops, which aren't very common but look great.<br></li><li>You also get a lot of bricks in pastel colors like bright pink, dark pink, lime, magenta, and medium blue.&nbsp; There are also common colors like yellow, white, red, orange, green, blue.&nbsp; The pastel bricks may be a con to some, but I've seen some great creations like Ice Cream and Flower shops that use pastel colors.&nbsp; I only wish this set had even more pastel bricks and less of the common colors.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The most common complaint most people will have about this set is the amount of Danish air included in the box.&nbsp; The brick box is large, but when you open the box the ~400 bricks barely cover the bottom of the box.&nbsp; On the positive side, this gives you plenty of room for future storage, but don't expect this box to be anywhere close to full when you buy it.&nbsp; Personally I knew what I was getting so I expected this, but I expect parents new to LEGO to be surprised when they open the box.<br></li><li>Like its brother set, the 6166 Large Brick Box, this set has a two stud deep door and windows.&nbsp; Most buildings in LEGO City are designed with 1 stud wide walls, so these are difficult pieces to use down the road.&nbsp; I've knocked down the 'Parts' score by 1 for this reason.<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall this is a great set that many people probably overlook because of the color.&nbsp; For $30US you get 400 bricks, a large storage box, and a LEGO horse, so it's a great value.&nbsp; The pastel colors may not seem useful, but if you use your imagination there are a lot of ways to use them even if you're a macho guy who doesn't like pastel.&nbsp; If you're a little girl like my daughter, you're probably begging for this set.&nbsp; I'd highly recommend giving into those wishes if you are a mommy or daddy like me, because it will spark a love of LEGO in your daughter, so she can play with her brother and gain all of the benefits that LEGO brings to a growing mind.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

"AETerry","2011-03-31T22:42:24.017Z","Large Pink Brick Box Review","<p>Outside of Duplo, this is the second Legoland set that I've bought my daughter. Her first one ended up getting mixed in and integrated with Mom's (Mine) larger collection of Legos due to her age level of 3 at the time and not wanting the pieces lost... well they are lost... technically, just mixed in with other sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to this set, it's very easy to see how with the color of pink that this is a brick set that is targeted towards and appeals to girls, to draw them into lego. My daughter loves pink, so it was easy for her to want this set when picking out a bucket set. But don't just assume a set like this must be for girls. There are lot of rarer colored bricks such as orange and pastels in here outside of pink bricks. Any serious collector of lego can benefit from picking up this bucket set for the pieces and to have them on hand for their MOCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A horse figure... which for me with all the years of collectingCastle sets and getting a couple of the rare Stable sets from Lego Town/City, I've got plenty of them. Gold Chalice for a trophy, champion horse &amp; rider. Female minifigure which uncommon if not rare to see or get. My daughter went and pulled a second female minifigure from the collection so it can Mother and Daughter with the horse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For parents, the bucket offers an easy way to store the Legos afterwords when play time is done. You can't beat getting a base plate to work with, though my daughter trades hers out frequently for one of the larger green ones we have. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while she's okay with me making builds for her from the instruction booklet that acts more as an idea book, showing different pictures of models and then instructions for building some of the ideas, she loves to take and create her own sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is just well worth it, from a parent perspective for a child, especially one who has a ""Pink Mad"" Toddler who is young enough to be convinced and believe pink is for girls, so a Pink set of Legos draws them in very easilly. And for the older and more serious collectors and fans, you have rare pieces and hard to come by colors worth considering picking this set up for.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
