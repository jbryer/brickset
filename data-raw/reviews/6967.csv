In my opinion it  is a great set for beginner. You can build quite a large number of different houses and/or cars withou being to complicated. In addition it has a great cost/piece-ratio.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"yerdna","2011-02-12T07:27:15.373Z","Very nice for LEGO starters","This is a very nice set to start your child's lego collection with. You get two figures and a very, very nice instruction book with lots of models. You can build a post office, a police headquarters and a general store and two vehicles simultaneously! True, the buildings feeature only a fassade and are by far not so complex as those in the Lego City series but they're good suited for a beginner.<br>The set does not contain many special or rare parts (the post box as the only exclusion).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>",TRUE,4,3,5,5,4
