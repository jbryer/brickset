"jinxjinx550","2009-12-03T09:51:17.577Z","Treasure Chest","Advent calendars are a genius product for real Lego fanatics.  They come with a boatload of minifigs, lots of often hard-to-find accessories, well-designed interactive boxes, and a series of tiny bursts of Lego construction fun.   They help to make December a bearable month, by giving you a small chunk of Lego to assemble every morning before you're off to work or to school.

I would love this set, if only for the great playset box flap, which is a perfect spot for setting up all the minifigs and accessory figures.  But it also comes with an extremely useful sorting tray for small parts (it's a bit fragile, but it's a great asset for sorting Technic pins, 1x1 or 1x2 pieces, and so on) and a lot of free ideas.  This morning I opened a door that let me build a tiny lantern, made completely out of 1x1 elements.  Very unexpected, very minifig-scale, and one of those building insights that make you ask yourself ""why didn't I think of that?""

Adults & teens who might think these sets too childish should really give these sets a try.  They are well worth the money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

my only question is why put captain brickbeard on the first day, isn't he the 'star' of the entire pirates theme, should'nt he be on the 24th day like santa in the Lego CITY advent calendars. any way other-wise one of the best sets I'v every purchased.

"smarty","2009-12-29T21:39:20.153Z","Aaargh!!","I just finished building this set after it arrived in the mail this morning, and I was not dissapointed!  Just like the City Advent Calendar the simplicity in the design of the accessories was most impressive!  Ok so here is what you get for a very reasonable price:
Day 1:  Captain Redbeard with 2 swords!
Day 2:  Treasure map table with sweet lantern and 2x1 log pieces!
Day 3:  Parrot with perch and cracker cup RAAA!
Day 4:  Soldier Boss with Tricorner hat and flintlock pistol!
Day 5:  Mini Cannon!  Although this cannon doesn't fire it looks very cool set up underneath the small tree from day 9.
Day 6:  The Crocodile! Snap! Snap!
Day 7:  AWESOME Female Pirate with eye patch and long brown hair also has a spyglass!
Day 8:  Castaway's Raft with red swirly flag!
Day 9:  Small Palm Tree with sand patch and AWESOME Crab!  It can hold minifig weapons!
Day 10: Wooden Barrel with Shovel and Pickaxe!
Day 11: AWESOME Castaway with long beard and long hair also has a fire torch!  WIIIILSOOON!
Day 12: Fish on Fire! Choice simplicity (probably belongs to the Castaway)
Day 13: Monkey with Banana!
Day 14: THE MERMAID!  AWESOME!
Day 15: Mermaid's Clamshell with Pink Gem inside and sand patch, rocks and sea grass!  Simple but Awesome!
Day 16: Food Table with Turkey leg, cup and Rat!  (what pirate kitchen would be complete without a rat?)
Day 17: Soldier with musket!  (the hat is not painted like in other new sets?)
Day 18: Soldier's weapon stand with handcuffs! (you actually get 2 sets of handcuffs!)
Day 19: Pirate with light green pants, red and white shirt and blue vest, smirk and dark green hat!
Day 20: Tub with white Oar!  (probably for day 19 pirate!)
Day 21: THE SWORDSHARK!  AWESOME!
Day 22: Skeleton with green snake!  (also comes with a spare arm!)
Day 23: Stone Skull Shrine with torches!  Creepy and Very Cool!
Day 24: Treasure Chest full of gems and large Gold Nugget!

This set Rocks!  there is so much playability as everyone has something to do!  The Mermaid's face is a double so you could have the shark after her, so change her face to scared!  The castaway comes along and shoves his burning torch into the sharks face and saves the day!
I would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys the Pirates theme, or any other for that matter.  10/10!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
