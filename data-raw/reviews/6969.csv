"parchioso","2009-07-06T12:03:23.047Z","How come no one posted a review yet? This one is good!","Lego keep coming up with new minifigs and along with them new vehicles, 7753 Pirate Tank gives us 2 new lego minifigs: Hondo Ohnaka and Turk Falso (sorry, I actually get to know them only by now),  Obi-Wan Kenobi is not new, but nice to have if you haven't got him already.

At around USD 50 in Hong Kong, I would still consider this a good buy, with 372 pieces including 3 minifigs (2 new and rare ones), again, the value would be determined by the quality of the vehicle. And for this one, I would give it a thumbs up.

The vehicle is not looking great actually, and honestly I haven't seen it in the Star War movie or TV series before, just did some research on the web and gradually knowing more about these pirate guys and their tank, but I found the design quite interesting, specifically the rising seat, but together with the minifigs the whole thing suddenly makes sense, a guy holding two guns appearing from the vehicle and starting combat action!

Besides, the two minifigs are good, at first impression, Hondo may appear to be a bad guy, but after some reading I think the character is a complex one, better watch the episodes before jumping into conclusion, and I have also taken a nice picture of this guy, you can check it out along with details pictures of the rising seat mechanisms at my blog:

Overall I would strongly recommend getting this set, after all, it is not expensive, why miss it?

"THX_1138","2009-08-08T13:56:32.137Z","Awesome!","When I first heard rumors about a Star Wars set called the 'Pirate Tank', I was skeptical, wondering what on earth it could be. I thought maybe it would be something kind of like the TX-130 Republic Fighter Tank. When I saw the first pictures of it, I thought it looked incredible. I was then pleasantly surprised to see that according to the website, it was at the Target I was planning to go to last night. 

Pros: 
-Reasonable price.
-Awesome looking.
-The build isn't very repetitive (building those two engine thingies on the back was rather tedious though)
-I love the minifigs. It's the cheapest set with Clone Wars Obi-Wan, which is pretty good aside from the face and hair, plus it's got those two awesome pirates. I especially like Hondo Ohnaka.
-The seat raising mechanism works well.

Cons:
-The seat raising mechanism means no interior.
-Stickers (I don't mind much but many people do).
-Flick-fire missiles.
-It would have been nice if they had made it a $50-$55 set and included another pirate, a clone or maybe Jar-Jar and one of the swoop bikes they used. Pilf Mukmuk, the Kowakian monkey-lizard, would have been nice too.

This is a very good set. I recommend it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"arctrooper170","2009-08-08T17:56:21.247Z","Here comes the pirates!","This set is amazing! I love how Lego kept this one under the wraps for a good time and released it as special edition, and i love shopping from Target. The set itself is decent sized for $40, and the minifigs are a really nice edition. To talk about the minifigs.there is Hondo Ohnaka who for one looks great and has so much detail on him he looks just as the guy on the show,and he comes with 1,I got 2 old time swords, you also get 1 authority kama or whatever, I got 2 aswell. The second minifig is Turk Falso, and he too is highly detailed aswell, he comes with 2,I got 3 classic pistols from forever ago. The last minifig is Obi-wan and unlike most I like the Clone Wars version because they actually have eyes instead of black dots, Obi-wan is the same as he was from the Republic Attack Gunship(7676) but with a semi-chromed lightsaber hilt. On to the Tank itself.It is about 9"" long and taking a guess 6"" wide so its fairly big. The color scheme looks nice as it matches the Droids' ships but then it looks piratey. The design is highly advanced with the ""wings"", engines and front along with the interior. There isnt much room inside because it has a mechanism to allow you to hit a lever and raise the chair inside, I guess you can use the inside to carry prisoners-Obi-wan. For Weapons it has 4 flick-fire missles and one larger turret, and it also packs great armor to protect the pirates.I highly reccomend this set,if you can find it 5*",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"captain_radda_radda","2009-09-18T00:54:58.843Z","Which side are they on???","I'll admit that when I purchased the Pirate Tank, I had my doubts. I opened the box, poured out the pieces and began examining the minifigures first. I was astonished. The pirates are superoir in every aspect. Turk's headband actually raps around his whole head. Lego even included his ponytail on the back side of the torso. Ohnaka is my new favorite fig. He looks great and is extremely TV accurate. The set itself is great and truly does show off the sleekness of the vehicle. The build was challangeing and was about an hour. Its easy to get confused with all the brown pieces. The pop-up feature works well but the doors are way to flimsy. The turrest is kind of far from the gunners seat. I wasnt impressed with the gunners seat because of the lack of space. Money-wise, this is one of the best deals out there.

Pros:
Pirates
An extra(but strangely different) Obi-Wan
The design
The color scheme
The features

Cons:
Flimsy doors
A lot of stickers(I just dont care anymore)
Flick fires dont fire too well. 

Overall:
A great set especially if you're looking for something different. If nothing less, get it for the figures. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"timqua","2009-08-13T21:35:40.06Z","Decent tank","I got this set from Lego.com since my local Target never got it in. It's a good set, but not as good as republic battle tank (which just became available on lego.com).
It is a straight-forward build, taking me about an hour. The build is not monotonous and offers good variability through the build. The set has good color contrast among its pieces without looking odd.
The tank rolls, has some flick-fire missles in the front and back. A figure can stand in the center, behind the mounted turret gun, and another figure can sit inside the tank. The inside figure sits on a piece that is elevated and he will push through the opening hatches. This is about the only technic piece of the set. There is no other room inside this area for anything else. It could be modified to have a floor and maybe two figures will fit in snugly.
That is pretty much all the set has in features. I do like the harpoon guns attached to the sides of the vehicle.
The figures include two unique pirates, which are very well detailed, and another obi-wan.

I like the set as a whole, since I collect these sets for display, but it's play value is limited compared to the Republic battle tank (which I give a 5). It is just barely worth 40 bucks. For collectors, it's a buy. But for play, there are other sets more worthy for the money.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"frostlass","2009-10-04T11:21:01.263Z","beware the pirates!","

       This set was one of the most fit sets I'd gotten yet!


        minifigs: The minifigures are awesome!The ones I thought were the most satisfying were the exclusive weequay pirates minifigures Hondo Onhaka and Turk falso.

           pirate tank itself: Overall, the set itself was really good. I was glad to see that it had a rolling mechanism like my republic fighter tank did.The missles on the pirate tank also rock!There is also a little pop-up seat in the back of the pirate tank.

        more: I also liked the characters weaponary systems.Obi Wan has a lightsaber, as almost everyone knows, but the weequay pirates have swords and weird looking blasters!

         Overall, I give this set a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"David1971","2009-12-31T16:13:53.247Z","Good hidden pop-up feature!","This was not initially a 'must-have' set for me, but I got it so I could have something new in Lego for Christmas. It seemed kinda unusual, in a good way - like the excellent Solar Sailer (set #7752) - and seemed to come with three interesting minifigs.

Both those things turned out to be true - the minifigs are pleasing and detailed, and the overall vehicle design is obviously unusual but still reasonably convincing. But I had not anticipated the most interesting feature. I have always liked 'hidden' features - things you wouldn't know were there just by looking at the model. In this case there is room for a whole seated minifig who pops up - or rises out elegantly - from under the top flaps, when you pull a lever. It's a very good mechanism and keeps the seat level as the guy rises up, so it looks impressive rather than corny.

On the downside, the set comes with stickers, but it looks ok if you leave them off. It's not one of the very best Star Wars sets, but it's good: not an A+ but a solid B.

In short, then, very good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoDad42","2010-01-18T21:36:43.03Z","Interesting Star Wars Tank!","Interesting Star Wars Lego model. Fairly easy build and nice design. Haven't seen the Clone Wars episode so don't know if the tank matches the t.v. show one accurately (need to look up). But it's a cool looking new Star Wars lego. 

PRO's-Design, hidden compartment that holds a seated figure which uses a technique lever that raises and lowers the figure (very cool idea), sliding lever towards front that fires 2 missiles, 2 flick-fire missiles at rear on tilting mount, a tilting canon at front/middle, 3 mini-figures (with 2 brand new Star Wars characters:space pirate figures). 

CON's- Overall very strong middle section and back construction but left and right side armor towards front could use another piece to secure it better. Stickers used for tops of the opening hatch should've been brick pieces (the stickers are fine but a brick plate would be better or a printed brick plate). When applying the stickers here, follow the instructions accurately so they line up properly with each other. 

Also this could be a con or not (I haven't seen the show so someone can correct me), the 2 new minifigures are cool but they seem out of place in the Star Wars Universe (meaning their look, not design-which is cool). Also, the mini-figures have guns and swords which again seem out of place in the futuristic Star Wars world. Also on the side of the lower wings to the back of the ship, there appears to be 'harpoon' looking weapons. Again does this fit into the futuristic Star Wars world? Perhaps lego should've designed these same 'old' looking weapons to have a new, futuristic style to them. I understand the pirate motif with the weapons but a futuristic style to them would've been better I think. 

Overall though I'd recommend this to any kid or adult fan of lego or Star Wars. Fun to play with. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"desire4one","2010-03-15T22:35:50.137Z","Spear Gun Surplus","<p>My lady friend recently got this set for me and I'm some what dissapointed.</p>
<p>The set is, in my opinion, strictly average.</p>
<p>It has some worth while parts in the form of brown pieces and a few hard to find pieces.&nbsp; The stickers are pretty cool and of course, we have the Weequay pirates.&nbsp; But in reality, they're not as great as they seem on the box.&nbsp; Clone Wars Obi-Wan makes an appearance, and these days you don't see him that much.&nbsp; The spring up chair is a nice mechanic, and may lead to a creative idea with custom sets.&nbsp; Sports two firing placements too, if your the kind that likes to play.</p>
<p>The thing that bothered me the most, although&nbsp;many of you may think is trivial, is the fact that they didn't include any of the &quot;trademark&quot; star wars blaster pistols and rifles.&nbsp; Come on...spearguns?&nbsp; 4 of them?&nbsp; And I don't know about you, but I have plenty of six-shooters from previous sets.&nbsp; Many of your younger buyers may not have been around during the reign of the western sets, but last time I checked, the Weequays weren't using Colt single action revolvers...just another way for the powers that be to hold control of low cost to produce parts.</p>
<p>Overall, its not the worst set I've ever built, but by far not the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pros</p>

"Snowtrooper76","2010-05-17T04:31:26.5Z","Un vrai délire de gosse !","<p>Comme tout set Star Wars, en le construisant on se demande toujours où les concepteurs veulent en venir avec autant de pièces spéciales. Et pourtant quel délire ! Un vrai bonheur ! Le plus incroyable (tous en conviendront) est la trappe cachée qui permet à un des pirates de sortir par surprise. Certains disent qu'inclure Obi-Wan est une erreur du fait qu'il n'ait pas combattu directement les pirates (je me base sur les critiques que j'ai pu lire ailleurs), mais franchement faut-il s'en plaindre ? Un set Star Wars de moyenne taille avec 3 personnages n'est pas courant, exception faite de l'Echo Base. </p>
