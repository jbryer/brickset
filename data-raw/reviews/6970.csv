I dont want to nag to much but we'll go directly to Pros vs. Cons

Pros:
Nice rare minifigs (may come on a magnet set soon, who knows)
the Green A-wing is pretty cool
Admiral Ackbar!
Cool Death Star hologram thing
build is smooth and gives a nice backdrop/scene

Cons:
Seems to be lacking a bit, especially for $99.99
hangar seems to be purpose built for this A-wing and doesn't work well with other ships

So overall it was ok, but kind of a let down after expecting an actual Mon Cal-cruiser from all the speculation.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2009-07-27T11:05:31.717Z","""It's a trap!"" - Admiral Ackbar","Well, I was at my local mall to check out the new lego store that had just been opened, and there were tons of legos, including heavily stocks shelves of this set. It came to me as a shock because I didn't even realize that they were out in the US. 

Anyways, this set is fantastic! The whole idea of the set to begin with is pretty smart. Now, I can understand that most people might not like the set a whole lot and down it just because the fact that it's just a room. Well, think about this logic. The whole home-one mon calamari cruiser in the movies, from the outside, looked ugly, bulky, and like a peice of junk. And, in all honesty, the only thing that you ever see of the inside is the conference room so the attachment of the hangar is like a bonus. There is no reason that lego should waste their time trying to make an actual home-one cruiser that would have to sell at like $300 or more. 

Anyways, well I got the set for a US retail of $109.99, which is a little pricy for a 789 peice set, but it's worth it. The set is basically three models in one and builds that way as well with numbered bags, something that I haven't seen in a while. This set is perfect if you mist the first two a-wings. The A-wing is a lot better designed than the 2006 model with the correct coloring corresponding to it's battle calling name. It is fitted with a proper landing gear that folds up and the back opens up to reveal a removable engine. 

The hangar is just awsome! It is perfectly designed and measured to match the size of the a-wing. It has a turning pad for the a-wing that uses a similiar design to the mustafar set, only much better. There's even a crane that can adjust from side to side and be used to remove the a-wing engine for repairs. Other hangar features include compartments on the bottom for storing weapons, a fuel pump that fits into the a-wing, and also a neat ladder that the engineer uses to get to his repair station. 

The conferencere room is probably the most detailed of the three models. It features adjustable dishes on the side that produce the hologram, the two peices necessary to make the hologram of the forest moon, plenty of room to add more characters for a meeting, three chairs including admiral ackbar's spinning chair, and a lever on the side that detaches the conference room and the hangar for seperate play. Plus another thing that I thought was cute and so predictable with the LEGO Group's tounge-in-cheek sense of humor was the little mug sitting in front of ackbar's chair. You never see it in the movie, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't there, I guess. *chuckles* :D 

The minifigures are one of the things that makes this set especially wonderful. The set includes a very detailed exclusive general madine, an improved lando calrissian with gun and gray cape, mon mothma with detailed torso and white cape, a-wing pilot with yellow helmet cover, a very detailed admiral ackbar with a non-rubber head, and another mon calamarian with wrench. 

All in all, this set is pretty incredible. With the mid-scale millenium falcon and the new Tantive IV coming out soon, this set is a must for your classic 10th anniversary lego collection. I am so glad that the fans chose to do this set over the other two. It really did turn out well. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2009-12-28T18:41:23.107Z","star cruiser? I think not.","ONe thing wrong with this set is its title. This isn't a cruiser, its simply a rendering of the inside of the cruiser. NOT a cruiser. just a planning station with a docking bay reminiscent of the pad from the bat cave set. Thinking of this set as the inside of cruiser is crucial to it being considered a decent set. The planning station is good, though, with a death star hologram and rare mini figs galore. I have to say, i got this set only for these qualities, nothing more or less. Price is of course slightly messed up, but its nothing new. THis set does come with some good gear turning techniques, like the head honcho calamari's spinning chair and the strangely colored A-wing docking bay. Buy this set if only if you're an avid fan, or you happen to have a large stash of money dedicated to legos",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"THX_1138","2009-09-04T17:56:29.547Z","Overpriced but still great","I had been expecting this to be a model of the Home One itself, like the Venator or ISD from '06. Unlike most, however, I was glad that it wasn't. I don't generally collect sets like that as they are way too out of scale. When I was pictures of this, I thought it looked great. I was especially excited about all the new minifigs.

Pros:
-6 minifigs, 5 of them new. The Mon Calamari head pieces are great. The torso printing on Lando and Madine are quite detailed and accurate. Also, a dark tan hairpiece.
-The use of the Bionicle pieces as the Death Star hologram is quite creative, and works well.
-The briefing room and bridge are great looking.
-The hangar is neat, though mine will probably be taken apart and used in other models.
-The functions to move Admiral Ackbar and the A-wing both work well.
-The A-wing is awesome. I don't have the one form '06, but I hope to get it soon, and they should look great together.
-The removable booster/engine thing on the A-wing is a nice feature, as is the crane to lift it out.

Cons:
-Quite overpriced at $109.99 for only 789 pieces and 6 minifigs, even if 5 are new and exclusive.
-The bridge section of the set could have been done better, with a floor and more control areas.
-A fair amount of stickers (I don't mind them much, and these aren't so bad, but many fans do).
-Just a minor problem I have with this, but the control panels in the briefing room are way to low. A 1 x 2 brick would have been better.

This is a great set, but is too expensive. The Battle of Endor may be a better deal (though I can't say for sure as I don't have it yet). I would especially recommend this if it goes on sale.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"timqua","2009-08-26T02:38:30.31Z","Exclusive","Got this set at Toys r Us, buying it early as to not miss it. Being an exclusive, they tend to retire early.

It costs 100-120 (depending on location) and is quite pricey for a set. Its unique setting and amont of figures just barely justify the price.

It includes a nice A-wing fighter, nearly identical to the red awing released couple years ago. The fighter pilot is nicely detailed and matches the ship.

The docking bay is well detailed and its technic piece (rotating and sliding the ship works very well and smoothly. There are storage spaces in the floor of the hangar which adds to its playability. It has a fuel station and walkway into the meeting room and has some good detail in these places.

The interior, meeting room, has a large hologram of Endor. This area is well-made and fits nicely together. Its secure and capable of being carried. It separates easily from the hangar bay but can only abut it on one side without modification.

Ackbar's chair is composed of another, but simpler, technic piece, allowing it to slide and rotate just like in the movie. Ackbar and his fellow calamarian are well detailed, have a solid plastic head, and are unique pieces.

The other figures are of the general and Lando--both good figures to have. Mon MOthma is included and features a nice white suit great for custom figures, including cape. Her inclusion in this set I thought was strange since she appeared so briefly in the movie (it was nice this movie was on TV while I was building the set).

I like this set overall. I think it is a bit pricey and could have used more figures or an additional room or ship in the hangar to justify its price,but it is exclusive and one must pay for that. I recommend buying due to some of its unique features.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Doyman","2010-06-25T14:05:54.123Z","Update to original review.","Just bought this set at TRU for $67. Don’t know why it was so cheap but it was the only one there and that’s how it rang up. I’m thinking it didn’t sell very well, much like I said in my original review comparing it to the Kenner Darth Vader's Star Destroyer. I bought it simply because I like the A wing and it has some figs that you can’t get otherwise. ",FALSE,2,5,5,3,1
"Carl","2009-12-30T18:37:36.403Z","Doyman you are a hethan!","1:Minifigs 

All these minifigs are new and they are awesome. Personally, my favourite is Ackbar because he is awesome as in the movie and my second favourite is the Mon Calamari Engineer because he is Mon Calamari and they are awesome as. The head pieces of the Mon Calamari Engineer and Ackbar are really well made and they look just like the movie. Minifigs:5/5 

2:A-Wing 

This A-Wing I think is better than the other ones greatly. First of all, it has green parts and green is my favourite colour, so yay. Also the cockpit flips open to reveal the A-Wing Pilot(who I call Arvel Crynyd because he was the pilot that crashed into the Executor) and the back hatches open to reveal secondary engines which I will explain about more in the 3rd category. The primary engines are awesomely designed as well and the model has a great build. A-Wing:5/5 

3:Hangar

Personally, I think that the hangar is great. Reverse trapdoors are put to good use as storage compartments and the little platform is cool. The turn-cog mechanism is the best mechanism ever. If you put the A-Wing on the turn-cog platform you can swivel it and move it along the service track. Also something really good is the overhead 'magnet'. Its not actually a magnet I just call it that. You put the A-Wing on the turn-cog platform and open its hatches. You then turn the little cog next to the magnet and it is lowered. You can then attach it to the stud on top of the secondary engines and pull them out so the Mon Calamari Engineer can fix them with his spanner. A minor problem is that it is kind of hard to put the secondary engines back in without using your hands, but as I said, it is a minor problem. Lastly, there are two fuel pumps which you can put in one of the A-wing's engines which is cool. Hangar:5/5

4:Bridge

The bridge is my favourite part of the model. The holographic Death Star is just like in the movie and the seating platforms are well designed. There are two overhead hologram projectors which are well sized and can be swivel around if you want to do something crazy with Admiral Ackbar. The top story of the bridge is well supported by the bottom and LEGO have once again used the new turn-cog mechanism with Admiral Ackbar's chair. I spent hours(exaggeration) making him the dizziest Mon Calamari in the Rebel Alliance. You can completely reenact the final parts of Return of the Jedi with this part. Bridge:5/5

And, as a conclusion to my review, I thought that I would include something quite humorous. In classic LEGO style, Admiral Ackbar has a coffee cup. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"David1971","2010-01-09T17:13:57.623Z","Delightful","A lovely set with six really nice minifigs, two great play areas, all nice colours, and with good clever (but not overcomplicated) features like the revolving chair, turntabley thing, secret compartments, and Admiral Ackbar's famous coffee cup. Set #8038, The Battle of Endor, was an amazing 2009 set and so is this one. Such high quality and attention to detail.
",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2010-01-01T22:42:30.013Z","Absolutely Astounding!","Wow! I picked this set up at TRU on sale for $80 today and I must say, it is worth it! Although it doesn't contain a decent amount of minifigs, the features make this set a 5/5 rating! This set is divided into two sections; the Command Center & the Hangar. They can be easily combined or seperated by a little lever constructed in the hangar.

Minifigs:
This happens to be the only set where you can get 5 minifigures; Admiral Ackbar, Mon Calamari, General Madine, Lando Calrissian (General version), and Mon Mothma. They are all designed to perfection and you receive rare white & grey capes with this set.

A-Wing:
I never owned an A-Wing fighter, but this really impressed me. The details are put onto stickers for anyone that hates them. Two flick-fire missles are also included with the A-Wing. The cockpit window can be opened also. The engine is shielded by two white LEGOs which fold over the engine. The engine itself is very detailed, and can be easily removed from the A-Wing by sliding it out from the rear.

Hangar:
This hangar comes with some features. There are two hidden compartments in the base which can be opened to hold tools or weapons. The crane which runs along the top of the hangar uses string to lower or raise it. There are also two ""hoses"" which probably give gas to the A-Wing fighter.

Command Center:
My favorite part of the set, this center is very accurate to the movie. Admiral Ackbar's command chair can be rotated and pushed back & forth. There are also two seats for Mon Calamaris to help command. There are two blue rays which project the Death Star II's inner structure. The projection is incorperated by two orange LEGO pieces. The entrances are nice and the bridge is very unique. The Command center could easily fit over 10 minifigs.

If you have read this entire review, I feel sorry for you. Anyway, buy this set. Even if you must get it for $110. Trust me, it is worth it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoDad42","2010-03-03T01:49:08.623Z","Great Play Set (if the price is right).","<p><b>The Home One, Mon Calimari Star Cruiser</b><i><b> (Limited Edition)</b></i>&nbsp;is a wonderfully designed set. Great A-Wing Fighter, Hanger Bay and Bridge with Tactical Room are all well designed and highly playable. I found it to be a fairly easy but enjoyable build. Overall nicely designed with some neat features.</p>
<p><b>A-Wing Fighter - </b>Well designed ship. I feel an improvement upon the previous version. Good color scheme with some rich/dark green pieces, cockpit opens/closes with hinge (interior cockpit has printed screen design ala' Death Star trench run), 2 long flick-fire missiles, rear engines nicely designed and a neat feature...you can take out the red engine from the back middle section. It is held into position, left and right, by a very simple but effective hinge technique which closes and locks the engine into the vehicle. Once opened, the engine can easily slide out. Also the A-Wing has front retractable landing gear. And of course, the A-Wing comes with a neat pilot mini-fig with the classic Lego face and nice graphics for the torso and helmet (w/visor that can raise/lower).</p>
<p><b>Hanger Bay </b>- Here in the Hanger Bay you have a large area to accomodate the A-Wing Fighter. There is a working crane accross the top of the Hanger which can slide left the right and uses a technique gear to raise and lower the 'hook'. The 'hook' can attach to the removable engine to raise it out of the back of the A-Wing to be worked on by your Mon Calamari mechanic mini-fig (which comes with a wrench). This mini-fig has a great head sculpt(captures the Mon Calamiri race perfectly). The A-Wing can be mounted to a long working technique piece with which you can move/spine the A-Wing 360 degrees as well as forward and backward. If you notice underneath the A-Wing are 2, 2x2 grey plates mid section. This helps mount the vehicle to the working technique. I suggest trying similar sized craft with the 2x2 plate addition to add more playability. In the hanger are 2 hoses which can be used to add fuel/energy to your vehicles or engine. And also there are 2 compartments on the Hanger deck to hold tools, weapons, etc.</p>
<p><b>Bridge/Tactical Room </b>- The Hanger Bay is attached with a technique pin to the Bridge and Tactical Room.&nbsp; The front/forward Bridge has the command chair for Admiral Ackbar (a wonderful well sculpted head and front/back graphics...best new mini-fig from Lego). The well designed chair has a&nbsp; tactical computer that can mount over&nbsp;Ackbar's lap. The command chair is also mounted to a technique gear so you can move him forward and back as well as 360 degrees. Just so much fun to have him move, spin&nbsp;and survey the field of battle or turn to the back and get some coffee from his clear coffee cup (attached to the back rail).&nbsp; Left and right of the command chair are 2 other chairs with computer screens you can raise or lower to accomadate mini-figs.&nbsp;Below and back of the bridge is the&nbsp;Tactical Room. Wonderfully designed with a curved back section and 2 large holographic projectors pointing towards the center. In the center of the room is the holographic (trans orange)Death Star (I believe the pieces for this are Bionicle). There are also two platforms above (left and right), 2 exits with steps (left and right) plus 5 computers screens around the back curve section. You can put all your favorite characters here or the ones from this scene from Star Wars to review the weaknesses of the Death Star!</p>
<p>And before I forget we have some other great mini-figs...Mon Mothma with nice wig sculpt and white cape, General Lando Calrissian with blaster pistol and grey cape (awesome torso design) and General Madine mini-fig.</p>
<p>This is one highly playable set with working gears, crane, vehicle, removable engine, compartments, movable command chair, etc. Great play features for your kid or like me the young at heart AFoL.</p>
<p>The only 'con's' I can give are this...first off, it's extremely minor, is the name of this kit. They call it a Star Cruiser but why couldn't the name be Home One Mon Calamari Bridge and Hanger Bay? Secondly, which is extremely major is the original price point on this. At $110 US dollars it's way over the top. There aren't really any truly unique parts(besides the new Mon Calamari heads)&nbsp;even though the design and playbility is spot on. To make this set justify the high price, Lego should've provided 2 to 3 more mini-figs (another Mon Calamari , maybe an X-Wing pilot or another A-Wing pilot) and perhaps some unique pieces, chrome pieces, printed tiles for the computers. Just something more to make you feel you got $110 worth.</p>
<p>Now I picked this up for $80 US at Toys R Us and that to me is a fair market price. Now with all that in mind...this is one great play set! Nice features throughout with some nice unique mini-figs you enjoy immensely. I Highly Recommend it if you get it at the right price. A truly well designed and playful kit!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,1

"Chills","2012-10-01T18:58:41.66Z","It's not a trap.... its a highly under-rated set!","<p>When I came out of my Dark Ages this year and started collecting Star Wars sets I came across this set and while researching it found that it was highly ""undesirable"" by collectors. I read the posted reviews and many people are not fond of this set. I must say I cannot see why. This is a fantastic set, one of the few 5s I have given out. Lego created a set that captured 3 important scenes in Return of the Jedi, and put them together in a clever way.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: This set does a great job reflecting the 3 scenes that take place on the Mon Calimari Cruiser in ROTJ. There is so much detail to them. First the briefing; this room has the semi-circular shape, it has the tiers like an auditorium, the Death Star hologram is also very cool, and it has the rounded shapes and angles that you saw in the movie. There are even the small control panels on each tier, also like in the movie.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The command bridge is also great. It is raised to give the sense that it is on the top of the ship. You have two spots for Mon Cal crew members, and the center seat for Admiral Ackbar himself. This seat slides back and forth and turns, replicating the movements from the movie. It also is bulkier than the other seats and has a cool control panel that folds down in front of the Admiral. There is even the mug on the railing in the back. When I was a kid I heard a rumor that a mug or a can was sitting on the railing. Maybe this is Lego's nod to that old tale.</li><li>Pro 3: The hangar, so detailed and full of playability. First off it is difficult to make a hangar that will hold a starfighter, it takes a lot of parts. But Lego did a great job with efficiency. They used a lot of grid-worked plates to reduce weight and it actually makes the hangar look cooler. You have tubes along the side, a crane to work on the A-Wing which slides back and forth, fuel hoses, the extension that sticks out of the bay is even shaped correctly, and you have a cool mechanism that rotates the A-Wing and allow it to ""fly"" into the hangar. I love this part of the set.</li><li>Pro 4: The A-Wing is really well done. I've seen other versions of this Rebel Interceptor and this one looks great. It is from Green Squadron so not only do you get a great set but you also get a cool starfighter for your collection. The cockpit opens forward like the B-Wing, the engine comes out for maintenance (by the crane), and there's a port for the refueling hose to hook into. Oh, and Lego even put a front landing gear piece in. Lots of detail for a small ship.</li><li>Pro 5: The minifigures! Wow, 6 figures that are ALL unique to this set (except Admiral Ackbar, but this is the best set to get him in). Ackbar and the Mon Cal crewer have the same head, but different bodies. General Madine looks just like the movies, Lando Calrissian is dashing as ever (and even has a blaster), Mon Mothma is elegant, and the A-Wing pilot looks ready to take on the Executor. Maybe this is the one that goes through its bridge?</li><li>Pro 6: I know, I keep going on but this is a great set. The playability is fantastic. You can unlock the sections to expand the set with your own MOCs. Sure the briefing room is right next to the hanger and the bridge. It wasn't like that in the movies but one has to use imagination. Like Lego's Death Star set, all those places weren't really so close together but so what, that is still an awesome set! In this one you also get some great pieces, cool colors like the green and the pale yellows. Plus lots of whites and greys.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: There are a decent amount of stickers. And for the first time ever I actually had stickers missing from a MISB set. I wrote Lego to see if they could send a replacement sheet.<br></li><li>Con 2: This is minor, but the white piece on the top center of the A-Wing's forward fuselage looks odd, like it doesn't belong... doesn't fit too well. But it is minor.</li><li>Con 3: This is also minor but I have to point it out. Mon Mothma has a very boyish haircut, but Lego used the same hair piece as Anakin has in Ep III, kind of long and messy. Mon Mothma's hair should be a red version of General Madine's<br></li></ul>
<p>The original price of this set was steep, at $109.99 I probably wouldn't have bought it. But there are SOOO many MISB examples out there that a collector can grab one for a decent price. There are plenty of sellers trying to get a lot of money for this set, so watch out. I got this for well under RRP, and am quite satisfied with my purchase. Lego did a great job with detail, playability, a fun build, and keeping the set like the movie. I own my first A-Wing, and have 6 new minifigures in my collection. This is truly a fantastic set that I feel is under-rated. I would recommend this for any Star Wars fan out there. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"chucktizzle","2015-01-05T17:32:08.76Z","Easy Build and Very Fun","<p>This is one of the most original and unique sets in the original Star Wars universe collection. There are four primary sections to the set.</p>

<p>1. The A-Wing is a fun build. &nbsp;It differs slightly from the other stand alone A-Wing kit. &nbsp;The rear fuselage folds open to reveal a removable engine module. &nbsp;This can be connected to and hoisted by the gantry.</p>

The hangar bay is great! &nbsp;This section is heavily drawn from imagination as there is only one scene in the movie that features the hangar of Home One, but the section fits in seamlessly. &nbsp;There are two floor compartments for storing tools or contraband. &nbsp;The gantry crane slides along the upper support and pivots left and right. &nbsp;The best part of the section is the docking collar for the A-Wing. &nbsp;This allows you to set the A-Wing down on a small support that can slide in and out of the hangar and can rotate the A-Wing 360 degrees.</p>

<p>3. The projection room is a clever rendition of the room from ROTJ. &nbsp;The stadium seating is well built with relatively few pieces. &nbsp;The orange projection globe in the center is a unique piece.</p>

<p>4. The spaceship cockpit room on the reverse of the projection room is interesting. &nbsp;It does a decent job of depicting the brief glimpses from the movie. &nbsp;the captains chair slides and rotates like it does in the movie as well. &nbsp;There is a good use of stickers for this room.</p>

<p>The completed set is surprisingly sturdy. &nbsp;It can be lifted by the two upper beam sections and carried easily.</p>

<p>There is a good variety of minifigures for the set. &nbsp;Admiral Ackbar, Mon Mothma, and Lando are great. &nbsp;The A-Wing pilot is pretty basic with the standard lego smiling face and shirt with little detail.</p>

<p>The playability of the set is what really stands out. &nbsp;You can spend a lot of time creating storylines involving the different sections of the kit. &nbsp;One of the most fun kits I&#39;ve built.</p>
