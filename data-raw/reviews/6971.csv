"Huw","2009-07-27T07:46:14.593Z","Save your money...","I bought this in impluse after seeing it in the new Argos catalogue, and paid £40 for it. I'm very rarely disappointed after spending money on LEGO but in this case I have to say that I am and I can't really recommend this set to anyone but Power Miners completists.

Sure, it looks good on the box (that's why I bought it) but once it's made its a big disappointment. It's articlulated in two places so the three wheelsets move independently. At least they are supposed to. Unfortunately the design is such that if you turn the vehicle too sharply or try and reverse it, the wheels touch, bind, and the thing grinds to a halt. I'm sure I've seen solutions to this on other models so it's a shame they didn't implement one of them here.

Pros:

- Comes with a large rock monster in red
- Good concept, and it looks good as a static model on the shelf
- 2 PM minifigs

Cons:

- Poor design limits playability
- Very expensive for what it is
- A lot of the volume of plastic in the box is in the 6 wheels, each made of 2 of the parts used in the drills on other PM sets.

"cameljockie","2009-07-27T18:48:07.42Z","Could have been better...","As an Argos exclusive hear in merry old England, I was expecting something 
worth my £40. This unfortunatly is not the case with this set. Once constructed you realise it is tailored more fo £25-30. 

Still having said that there are some good things to mention. First of all the design of the cave crusher; two articulation points which Ive never seen before on a lego vehicle. The beeft wheels work well on caprpet, but will slide off anything smooth.

The mining station is a neat idea. although when stored on the vehicle one questions as to how you are suppose to lower it. some kind of crane winch woulda been nice to see...

The figs a great as is the red uber rock monster. Im personally more interested in the mining gear than the monsters, and am glad it comes with two miners. although the second one has no where to sit which is a shame; he is completely exposed to the elements!

So here it is:

Pros:
- Nice design, especially when looking from the front.
- Dual Spinning blades.
- The massive wheels!
- The mining platform.
- Two Miners.
- Uber rock throwing monster!
- Useful parts.

Cons:
- When turning, wheels will lock up into each other. Come on Lego, how is this exceptable?!
- lack of cab detail...only a steering wheel?!
- Somewhat skinny for a £40 vehicle.
- The box is stupidly big and long for a medium sized model.
- Over priced, even for a 'special' release.

My suggestions to anyone tempted is only get this if you are a devoted fan to the power miners theme. if not, you may be disapointed!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"jjr","2009-11-16T12:31:08.343Z","What the!!??","Okay this is my review and this sis my second PM set

I bought this set because it looked better than the rock wrecker however..

When I opened the giant box I saw empty space and more empty space. And then out of the emptyness I saw 3 bags. The bags were even oversized and mostly filled with air. I immediatly thought this was something bad...really bad.

The built was easy ,really easy, no maybe too easy. nothing challenging really boring and ultra fast.

The final model containes two power miners (those are cool) and a giant red rock monster (that one is also cool) and the cave crusher. Well the model is cool to look at but really is skinny, as you maybe already know is that the weels easily lock when the vehicle is turned. the saw blade(s) however are cool and the small mining thingy at the back , and those nice red crystals!

final judgement 

Price:3/10
minifigs:5/10
building:2/10 (well for a 50 euro set I expect a little more)
play: 6/10

OVERALL:4/10 

Okay is I were you I would buy another set, like the cool crystal king or the brute force rock wrecker, but really even if you are a die hard PM fan I wouldn't recommending this set to anyone.

this is the first time in years I'm dissapointed with lego

"JBH75","2009-12-25T11:37:34.25Z","Stop Trolling on this model!!","I got this set for Christmas along with my Atlantian and other Power Miner ensembles, and I got to say this set is pretty good (not the greatest though). This set is fairly big and has great functions, and includes 3 minifigures and various accessories. This doesn't really deserve most of the punishment it gets in reviews but it definitely has flaws. Here are my pros and cons.

Pros:
Cheapest way to get Tremorox (the Big red guy who isn't Santa)
Two miners (Nothing new though)
Pickaxe, Shovel, Dynamite, Pneumatic Drill, 3 crystals
Excellent Functions (Spinning saws, saw launcher, and detachable station)
Looks great as a static model
Very Playable
Cab hood opens up to allow easy access
Flamethrower is well designed but also flawed

Minor Cons:
Vehicle locks up moving in reverse (unless dragged from the back)
Lack of cab detail (needs buttons, dial, and levers but with all the extra parts thrown in Power Miners models this can be fixed)
Saw launcher doesn't fly far unless pressed fast.
No Rock for Tremorox

Major Cons:
Price is horrible, for 259 pieces it costs $64.99 Cdn. 
Flamethrower flame is puny, substitute for a space police flame
Stickers!!

This set really isn't that bad. It just has some minor problems that can be fixed with ingenuitive thinking. The only real flaw is its price. If you can work around that, this model is great.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"indyman09","2009-12-30T08:11:44.827Z","Great set.","This set is awesome.
I like it the most because of the genious rockmonster. He is super-big, has an really cool face and his hands with the throwing-construction are awesome. The only thing I don't like about him is that he hasn't got moveble jaws. The vehicle is great. The little miningstation on the back does the job. 3 minifigs for a 50 euros set is not much. But i bought this set 2 days ago for only 32 euros. That's a good price. Now on to the pro's and con's.

Pro's:
Really cool rockmonster.
Finally another few red crystals, three.
The vehicle is pretty big.
two miners, for power miner sets that's a lot.
the saw-blades work really good.
12 wheels, the little ones.
A little mining station on the back.
really good and rare pieces.
It can take really good corners

Con's:
I don't have much con's.
the rockmonster hasn't moveble jaws.
the catapult on the vehicle don't work well.
Sometimes after a corner the wheels get a bit stuck.

After all a great set, the pro's are dominating.
I highly recommend this set to everyone, even if you're not a fan of lego power miners, buy it! But check out the price, only buy it with sale.
and it is the cheapest way to get tremorox and he is tricken awesome!!

"frostlass","2009-10-19T11:01:29.763Z","ok, It'll do.","I think lego could improve this one a bit.

           Structure: Well, overall, this one does need a little more engineering.
the saw blade catapult worked well, so do the two in the front, but the rest would go better if it took more engineering on these certain parts.For example,
if you tried to turn this veichle around a tight curve, the wheels would get stuck
and the veichle would go to a complete hault.The mining station in the back otherwise is NOT easy to take off (at least not without taking the white claw piece off with it)!

      minifigs:Well, the are at least better than the structure of the cave crusher!This set comes with Duke, a scarred guy, and the metal plate guy.It also comes with a big Tremorox rock monster!

    So...I will give this set a 3/5.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"TheFadedTBCap","2010-03-05T21:03:49.233Z","The Cave Crusher is an awesome set.","<p>I ordered this set online since&nbsp;I couldn't find it in stores and I'm glad I did.&nbsp; It is awesome!&nbsp; The saws really spin and Trammorox really throws things.&nbsp;</p>

"EtudeTheBadger","2010-03-27T17:47:06.857Z","Six-Wheeled Animal","<p>This one was hard to find, as around my town it's an Argos exclusive. So, was it worth the limited availability?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, maybe. It depends on what standpoint the assessment comes from. For overall desgin, the vehicle is very well made. The wheels give the machine some grip and width, the sawblades look cool and the launchable blade works very well. Tremorox is a great monster, and it's great to see LEGO finally selling RED Crystals (I've wanted these ever since Rock Raiders in 1999). Duke and his miner cohort (that last character is never actually named, though I've called him Mewn in a brickfilm I made for a course) are a good team to drive the vehicle and operate its panoply of equipment.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some problems with the vehicle. Although the wheels look superb, they do lock when the vehicle articulates to a certain degree. This limits the movement of the Crusher and ironically renders it useless in the environment it is supposed to work in! The Crusher also has a flamethrower, which is good, but the wheel it holds in place comes off if the thrower is called into play. There is also no chunk of rock for Tremorox to lob; the instruction illustrations depict him lobbing a crystal, which raises some poignant questions I can't really be bothered to go into right now.</p>
<p>For all that, it's a worthy purchase, and I'd recommend the Cave Crusher to Power Miners fans wholeheartedly, but I'd once again warn the more neutral consumers to try before handing over the green for it.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Good design for the most part</li>
    <li>Miners are great</li>
    <li>More red Crystals; cool</li>
    <li>Tremorox is a fine addition</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Limited movement in certain underground areas</li>
    <li>No rocks for Tremorox to throw</li>
    <li>Flame thrower use is limited</li>
    <li>More stickers- ppppht</li>
