"ET","2009-07-31T18:36:05.607Z","Loads of Fun","This is the best Power Miners set by far! I had been waiting forever to get this, and it did not dissapoint.

Control Tower:

This tower has all the rare pieces. Two carrots sit in a crate below, and by them is a neat platform. I like the crystal formations, and I'm glad to see Lego making stuff like that. You can follow the ladder up into the control tower, where you can oversee the entire station. I don't like the flick-fire mechanism on top, they should have put in something similar to the one in 8707. 4/5.

Zipline/pipes:

This is my favorite part, since it gives the set an underground feel. If you turn the wheel on the tower, the cart travels across the line and hits two tubes, flipping it and causing the crystals to tumble down the chute and into the cart. I put 6x16 dark red baseplates from 8877 to construct the lava river the description talked about. 5/5.

Mining Tower:

Four pirate masts hold up the main tower. Like I said before, I like the zipline mechanism, as it works well and makes the set feel like an actual mine. On the very top there is a spotlight similar to the one in 7785, two antenna, and a creatively used fence plate positioned to serve as a platform. 4/5

Minifigs:

My first-ever throwing monster, I really like him. Both his arms come off, and it's a lot of fun to have him fight my Mine Mech. Unfotunately, Geolix's legs don't move, his mouth doesn't open, and his arms needs to be bent back far for him to throw something. The miners are same old, same old. But overall, 4/5

Pros:

Carrots!
Four crystals.
Geolix.
BIG.
Three miners.
Cool cart.

Cons:

Could have had a Boulderax.
Should have had a drill.
More living space would be nice.

Overall, 4.5/5! Kind of like a fururistic Dwarve's Mine.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"frostlass","2009-10-19T23:31:33.92Z","The ultimate power miner station is finally here!","        I waited forever to get this set and it didn't fail me one bit!

                    control tower:I couldn't believe how many rare pieces this set had from top to bottom!But, I think the control tower had the most of these spectacular pieces.The control tower also comes with cool details like a walkie-talkie and a fire extinguisher!On top of the control tower, there is also a dynamite launcher!

                   crystal dumping tower:This tower, however, is the one on the right.Itis also the taller one.This tower holds the biggest piece of the whole mining station!.The other thing I liked about this tower is that you can dump the crystals in and make them fall into the little crystal cart !There is also tons of space under this tower, where you can stick the crystals and have your miners mine there, or, you can put the mining cart there if you like, and last option, you can make Geolix stalk around there if you'd like.You can do the same with the control except, Geolix can't fit under that tower.

zip line:The zip line is awesome too!It is connected in between the two towers.This, is where the crystals (even miners) get transported to the crystal cart.But I don't think this would be the best part for those of you who don't like string on their LEGO sets (same thing with the titanium command rig).

minifigs:This set came with 4 minifigs. It came with version 2 of Doc, the boss miner, Duke, a scarred miner, and Rex, the machine engineering miner.The last minifig was a rock monster minifig named Geolix.

I totally give this set a 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"_3__H0M_RU","2011-07-17T02:48:32.93Z","The FIRST Ultimate Power Miners Base!","I really enjoyed this set because it is a great battle fort for the miners to fight against the rock monsters. It also comes with a zip-line to send the energy crystals from one spot to another, dumping the energy crystals onto a slide which put the energy crystals into a little cart. Equipped with dynamite weaponry they can thwart the attempts of Geliox trying to take the energy crystals from the miners.Overall I say its a good Lego for power miners fans. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4
