"JBH75","2009-05-22T21:35:31.17Z","It could've been a litttle better!!","<p>When I noticed all the new 2009 sets at Toys R Us, I saw this and the other sets. I bought this and the Freeze Ray Frenzy along with it (Review coming soon). This set was&nbsp;okay when&nbsp;compared to all the other Power Miners sets I own, mostly due to the piece per price ratio. Here my Pros/Cons:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Geolix (Giant Sulfurix) ""With rock-flinging action""<br/>3 Crystals, Dynamite, Pick, Shovel, and a Coffee Machine<br/>Flick-fire Net Launcher</p>
<p>Side saws&nbsp;spin well, assuming you read&nbsp;the intructions</p>
<p><br/>Cons:<br/>Smaller than box shows </p>
<p>Net Launcher doesn't fire far (usually)<br/>Expensive for the price/piece ratio<br/><br/>This set was average! It possesses great action and playability, but it's going to be smaller than you think. If your a Power Miners fan, buy this set, otherwise live with the piece/price ratio.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"legoassassinV2","2009-05-24T19:43:22.653Z","You'll like it if you give it a chance/love powerminers","When people saw the first pictures of the second line of Power Miner sets, they were mostly dissapointed compared to the first line. I was at first but I got this along with the crystal king and the Rock Wrecker turned out to be pretty cool in my opinion!

It has a net launcher that works pretty well along with a random coffee maker which I thought was a nice touch. The cockpit is kind of cramped, similar to the crystal crawler but I think it's cozy! The Rock monster is cool looking and has one arm that can be moved via trigger on his back. There's also an opening in the middle of the vehicle with space for extra Power Miners to stand or sit, plus a safe too. 

I think that this set along with the 2nd wave were judged too quickly and weren't given a chance. When I first saw this I thought it was stupid if those saws didn't turn, but in the end it turned out that they did and I wasn't dissapointed. 8 saws spin for vehicle number 8. What a nice coincidence. I give this a 5/5, although the price could be lowered down to $30 instead of $35.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"J_G_48","2009-05-30T21:36:15.483Z","Could be A LOT BETTER!!","This could have been a lot better - it is a major disappointment.  Here are my pros and cons:

PROS:  

Geolix - he's big and awesome.
Coffee Maker inside
Saw Blades actually turn
Lots of accessories (incl. net, firing dynamite, crystals and storage dept.)

CONS:

Net flicker does not work - huge disappointment.
Pathetic looking rock
Much Smaller than expected
Not a good price for the piece count - should be $12 less.

I gave this a 3 because it has lots of accessories, which I like.

I couldn't wait to get back to the hotel to put it together.  I put it together after I went swimming.  After I got the vehicle put together, I thought it was really cool how the blades spin.  I really like the rock wrecker and would recommend it!! Everybody should buy it for themselves.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-08-17T17:04:36.623Z","Spinning Saws","How bout I cut to the chase on this one? As usual with my reviews I'll get right to the minifigs. The Minifig (I have to remember the names) is you're basic power miner. Pants have a chain and flashlight painted on. Shirt (sleevless by the way) has wire cutters and a magnifying glassin his pockets, also painted on. On his back is the saw symbol with a bomb inside. Once again painted on. The face has a stubbly beard, determined eyebrows, and some scratches and scars. Not much to say with the scared face. The helmet is the basic power miners helmet only with goggles.
Geolix is on massive brute. This yellow ""big bro"" isn't very posable. His legs are molded together, and they have grey parts painted on. His jaw doesn't move, but he has a massive underbite which shows his jagged teeth. His arms are ratcheted, he has 3 crystals on his back and can also hold his rock on his back too. The arm throws the rock quite well, but you may have to position it a few times in different spots to get it perfect.
Now for the Rock Wrecker. The cockpit is quite roomy and has a steering wheel so the minifig can, well, steer. it also is the place where you can find the coffee maker (Lego thinks of everything). The top of the cockpit can come off to get inside. In the front there are also the saws-more on that later. Going back behind the saws is... a hole? Probably for miners, crystals, or captive rock monsters. There is also a box the put in 2 diamonds. Up and to the back of the hole is a storage spot for a shovel on one side and a pickaxe on another. Also there is the big wheel that can go over any surface-hard or carpet. There is also a flick-fire dynamite launcher and net shooter. And to get the best launch, first I fold the net like laundry until I get the smallest square possible. Then shove the least frayed corner in the launcher. No you're ready to launch.
Now for the saws. There are no gears. It's friction powered. The friction from the wheels spin all the botton saws, and the bottom big saws spin the big top saws- all through friction! But you must place the wheels where they say to on the directions. If the saws aren't working, chances are you did something wrong.
Overall a very good set but a little small for the price (as with all power miners sets). I highly suggest you get it. A great addition to the power miners collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mr_brightside711","2009-06-30T23:17:00.077Z","Eight is Great!","I just got this set after ordering it online and I like it more then I thought I would. I kinda like how there are 8 blades on this one too.

This set is fun and easy unless you make a foolish mistake.
BEWARE: if you do not pay close attention where the stickers go you may have a problem. 
I got confused with the 2 larger saws on the right side of it, and put the stickers on the wrong side. I you make this mistake... use a blow dryer to heat it then quickly take it off and move it to the other side! 

The 8 blades are very nice and the rock monster can through the little rock a few feet! The net launcher also is a good addition to the set.

Pros:
Good Size
Good Price
4 large Saws
Dynamite
Net
Coffee Maker
Windsheld
3 lime green crystals
Geolix (large lime green rock monster)
Geolix has huge arms good for throwing
Large Back Wheel
Axe
Shovel
6x3 space for miners
The head lights
New Peices
Compartment for diamonds

Best Feature:
All 8 blades really do spin when the vehicle is moving

Cons:
Stickers (that do look good)
Only one minifigure
Flick fire if not stable
Side Blades are a little far back
The front blades do bounce a tiny bit but thats how they spin
Geolix's mouth is non-existant

This is a nice addition to the power miners team.
It may seem ugly but its a big green wrecker machine! Its not supposed to be pretty! and the hulk ain't pretty either. but Im sure you reading this, would love it. SO GO OUT THERE AND GET IT ALREADY! YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

	This set looks horrible in my opinion. It looks like a meat grinder in the front and the meat exiter in the back. The two launchers in the back don&#39;t look that good, they seem too close together and unsupported. The little orange saw mechanism could&#39;ve been put together better. They wouldn&#39;t always move with the wheels.</p>
<p>
	The back of the vehicle was too thin compared to the meat-grinder front side. There&#39;s also a 6x3 empy space only big enough for one rock monster to stand in.</p>
<p>
	The Geolix was pretty good, exept for his arm that wouldn&#39;t&nbsp;stay up&nbsp;unless you held the switch. I was also thoroughly disappointed by the fact that he couldn&#39;t move his jaw.</p>

"Trueblox","2018-08-06T08:11:19.167Z","A very good looking machine!","<p>Hello, i am Trueblox. And today i will review set 8963, Rock Wrecker.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lets take a look at the box first:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The art on the box looks pretty good, it shows the Power Miner in the Rock Wrecker and Geolix, the Rock Monster throwing a rock at the vehicle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, lets look at the figures:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rex - I think he looks good, he looks like your ordinary Power Miner. He has some goggles for protection, i guess, and he is sleeveless.</p>

<p>Geolix - Oh man does this figure rock! (Pun intended) He is a big-fig, and he has a lever in the back so he can throw the rock! He might be my favorite thing in the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, lets take a look at the build:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Rock Wrecker looks wonderful, the only slight annoyance is the hole in the middle of it, but i put a crate in there for more crystal storage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion on this set:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I say that this set is very, very good. It comes with a big-fig and the Rock Wrecker looks fantastic. I reccomend this set for the fans of Power Miners, like me. Plus its a cheap way to get Geolix.</p>
