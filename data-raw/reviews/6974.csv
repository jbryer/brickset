"mondayxmilk","2009-05-28T05:20:01.437Z","could have been better!?","Seriously, this set is HUGE!... a lot longer/taller than the crystal sweeper (needless to say actually). It got a drill similar to the thunder drill's one, and also a crane.

Pros
- new and big rock monster + a small one + 3 miners = 5 minifig, actually it's 4 minifig + 1 BIGfig
- a lot of accessories
- big drill, big wheels, big tower, everything is big!
- 5 crystals!
- got the net launcher
- a nice addition to the line, similar to a base for the miners

Cons
- the overall design is kinda bulky
- the crane part used up a lot of pieces, could have been smaller, and perhaps make something else
- expensive! look at the price/piece ratio
- too much accessories, some of them are really meaningless and repetitive (like the net & dynamite launchers, the BANANA, and more)
- the miners minifig should have different outfits
- will be running out of room if TLG release more BIG sets...

Some final comments... I think TLG should have added some kinds of ""stabilizers"" to make the set more realistic, like you wouldn't want the vehicle moving back and forth while the drill is digging right?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"donneyboy","2009-07-04T12:44:09.42Z","one big beast of a vehicle","Hello everyone, I'm Donneyboy, and today I'm going to bring you a review of the 8964 Titanium Command Rig from the Power Miners theme.

Measurements:

As it is the largest set in the Power Miners' theme to date, it isn't cheap at $99.99 and only 706 pieces. The piece/price ratio is about 15 cents a piece. However, if you don't mind the price or the sad truths, what the rig lacks in pieces for the price it makes up for with a nice, clean design and extreme detail, groundbreaking features and exciting bonuses, all wrapped up in a sickly orange/lime green package. The rig is huge... over 40cm long, and when extended into a drill tower (more on that later) it's almost half a meter tall. It's about a ruler wide with the giant black wheels. No doubt, you'll need a large display area to show off this sucker. The giant rock monster, Tremorox, is 6 cm tall. With the throwing arm up and loaded, it's actually about 10 cm tall. Nothing about this set is small other than the minifigures.

Figures:
Three of the four Power Miners are included- Brains, Duke and Doc. Brains is an extremely well detailed figure, serving as a scientist on the rig. His pants are printed the same as the other miners, though his torso is unique and double-sided. He shares the same helmet type with Doc- a blue helm with a dark-clear visor. His insignia on the back of his shirt is a test tube. Duke is also well detailed, although he matches Doc exactly other than his helmet and insignia. His helmet has goggles rather than a visor, meant to suit the visor pattern on his face (likely due to the smoke and dust). His insignia is a drill, as he operates most of the machinery. The last figure included, Doc, is the leader and therefore has a star insignia on his back. His helmet is the same as Brains'.

All three figures are well detailed and also feature double-sided heads, showing their scared faces. This is done well, as the helmets fully cover the back of the head. The blue suits are very attracting to the eye, against the grey and lime and orange of the rig. On top of the minifigures, a Glaciator is included, although no blue crystals come with the set. Like any other Power Miners monster, he is very small but still an attractive figure. He can ""swallow"" crystals if you open his mouth (which opens very similar to a garbage can). The detail on the monster is superb- with grey stone patterning covering the icy body, it really looks like part of the earth.

But enough talk about minifigures and rock monsters. You're looking here to find out about the new Rock-Throwing monsters, aren't you?


Meet Tremorox, UFC heavyweight and Anderson Silva's worst nightmare. Weighing in at half a pound and made entirely of plastic, his gigantic muscles and shovel hands are sure to be a crowd favourite. Some call him the BURP, others call him cheesy.

Whatever you call him, he's freaking awesome. As the evil monster in this set, he plays the part well. His arms both move on click joints, and with the shovel shape of his hands, he can carry bricks; providing his arms are up. The transparent red that makes up his legs, teeth and back spikes make him a very attractive and interesting model, with lots of rock/muscular detail. As the Castle Troll equivilant, what really makes him stand out is his throwing feature. However, there's a slight problem. The hands are well designed, but they can have trouble holding the 2x2 cylinder brick included due to the size. It can rest comfortably inside his palms, but if you move the beast while he's holding the rock, it will most likely slide out. I've almost lost it three times over the last 2 days, just by getting a better aim. When you can get it right, however, throwing is a blast. Using the lever on the back, you can throw the arm forward (and launch the rock) to wreck the vehicle or knock over a few figs. While it takes some time getting used to, you can eventually comfortably aim and fire, getting direct hits every time. My best advice is to pull the arm back far, so that it arcs to hit its target.

He has trouble standing up on carpet, however. On flat surfaces he's perfect, but on carpets, it may take some patience to be able to set him up on his own. Due to his small feet and giant arms and head, balance can be hard to achieve. If you put him on a small plate, he's fine, and I find it improves accuracy with the throwing arm. Having two of these could be fun, as you could challenge your friend to a shooting contest.

The final detail about Tremorox worth mentioning are the 12 studs on the hump of his back. This could be good for MOCing, as you could really make him into anything- a steed, a chariot puller, a walking throne, or you could add in some more rocky detail. Adding these studs was a great idea. The crystals they put on his back (the back spikes I mentioned earlier) look great already, but I'm sure modding Tremorox is a possibility.

The Model:

So the figures are great and both Rock Monsters are perfection. How to describe the Titanium Command Rig?
The Titanium Drilling Rig is gigantic. Made with many beams, technic parts and large plates, the base of this model you start out building grows bigger and bigger with Bag 1. The wheels are huge, all eight of them big enough to crush Power Miners and regular Rock Monsters alike. The planetary drill on the front is larger-than-life as well, and is made up of three parts (although only the first two rotate). The drill rotates as the rig rolls, although if rolling backwards, the rig will often get caught on its gears and skip. When upright, the rolling gears no longer work, however, a turning gear is still left on the tower which can be rotated to power the drill. The drilling features in general work very well. Also part of the set is a giant crane, which can carry very heavy loads, such as Tremorox. The detailing on this set, from the fire canisters around the front to the cabin is huge, and fun to build. Everything about this set is larger than life.

As well, this is definitely the most practical model I've ever built. With many special features, most of which are powered by gears and technic beams, it's difficult to get bored with the set. With the planetary drill, working crane, back winch, tower feature, crane prop, net launcher, dynamite shooter, rolling wheels, mini labratory and docking station, there's enough in this set alone to keep you busy for hours. It's the kind of set that would be fun in a sand box. Every single one of these features works perfectly, save the net launcher and dynamite shooter, which are somewhat inaccurate but still fire very easily. There are loads of accessories- a pickaxe, shovel, jackhammer, oxygen mask, buzzsaw, banana and radio. The tower/drill feature (which could easily have ruined the model) is flawless and easy to use. The stickers (a smaller sheet, thank god) are well placed and although unneccesary really make the model look good. The set has a cool steam/industrial sort of look to it, although it's lime and green.

While many people disliked the lime green and orange colouring on the Power Miners vehicles, it really looks amazing on this model. If it were in a really boring colour, like white, then the model would be difficult to appreciate. The outrageous colour scheme is actually one of the best parts of this model, it makes it look very attractive and fun to look at.

Finally, the model has lots of room for extra figures. Although most of the figures in the line are included in this set, there is still Rex to collect to finish the team. As well, if you're not picky, you could always just put anyone on who you want from the smaller sets. I'm planning on buying the Crystal King to give the giant drill of the rig a true foe to face, as this gives me Rex and an extra, unnamed miner. The set lacks extra smaller vehicles, and as there are only three figures, many of the features and tools are never used as Doc is always using the crane, Duke is always in the command center, and Brains is always down in the lab. This is an excellent centrepiece for your collection, and with a few extra figures, you can really put the rig to its full potential.

Conclusion:
Design: 8/10
Durability: 7/10
Figures: 10/10
Features: 10/10
Unique Parts: 10/10
Accessories: 9/10
Compatability: 10/10
""WOW"" factor: 10/10
Size: Very Large

The set is slightly expensive, and with news of vehicle 9 and a Power Miners base coming out, you may be tempted to buy another set. Don't be. This is one of the most ingenious and unique building experiences you will ever have, and as well, it is a long build. It took me 3 hours and 45 minutes to complete the rig. I have a hunch that this will be another sleeper hit, another set just forgotten about, but sleeper or not, it's still a hit. If you're bored of the same build over and over, the same uninspired City Car or the same duplicate Bionicle, than this set will be like a mad science experiment to you. It's a breath of fresh air. A masterpiece. A work of art. A true beauty.

Beauty at a cost.

"illegalwaffles","2009-12-13T20:28:26.857Z","Nice, but a couple of issues...","The First Impression: i saw this set on brickepedia in april (i think) and i instantly fell in love with it. through th months up to its release, i learned more about it. the drill tower amazed me, i wanted to get it to see how it worked. then, in july 2009, i finaly bought it. 5/5

The Box: so, you buy the set, you bring it home, and you put the HUGE box on the dining room table, you look at it, seeing the functions and the figures, and you can't wait to build it!5/5

The Figs: there are 5 minifigs i this set, 3 miners and 2 rock monsters.
Duke. he has a drill logo on the torso,  plus suspenders and pockets. on the back are the suspenders again and another drill, along with a t-shirt underneath. printed legs have a flashlight and a chain. the headis covered in dust from working the drill, plus a smile and a unibrow. the back of the head has the same thing, but has a scare frown. the blue helmet has goggle on it.
Doc. the torso has a star logo, pockets, and suspenders, plus a polo shirt underneath. on the back is a star and the suspenders again. the legs have a flashlight and a chain. the head has a slight smile on his face, along with cheek details. the back of the head has a jawdrop expression on it. the helmet has a visor on it, a new feature.
Brains. he has a test tube and pockets on his shirt, along with suspenders, and a polo shirt underneath. on the back is a test tube and the suspenders again. the legs have a flashlight and a chain. the head has a small smile, a mustache, and a weird lense on one eye. on the back is a look of ""Oh s---""
Glaciator. a blue rock monster, no crystal. hinged head, but it could have been something else, i alredy have 3 of them.
Tremerox. a large red rock monster. transparent red teath and legs, 3 red crystals on his hunchback(lol), and he can throw ""rocks"".
5/5

The Build: You're finaly ready to build the set.you start with the base, then the platforms, the crane, and then the tower.there are 2 problems. the first problem is that there are 2 different sized strings, which could confuse the builder, but in the end, it isnt a problem. the second is that it has 706 pieces in a $99.99 set, it could have been more.
4.5/5

The Features: the drill works with 2 4 tooth gears that work with extra hidden wheels in the middle of the set. this might not work if you roll it on an uneaven surface, but thats the only problem with that. there is a crane, but when realing in, the crane flips out like its having a seisure(double lol). there is an extra string on the back of the vehicle for towing/zipline, VERY handy(triple lol).
the tower is the main feature of the set,  and the top part of the tower is a little stiff, but that can be fixed by taking out the 5-axle and the double pins that are connected to it and replacing it withan 8-axle and 2 bushings. the dynomite launcher and net launcher work fairly well, but not perfect. finaly, the 2 flames break off REALY easily.
4/5

The Final Verdict: even with all the problems, this is still an excelent set, and i HIGHLY recomend this product.

"Foxbat","2010-01-05T01:28:04.623Z","Discount!","After finding this set at one of my local walmarts for the awesome price of $69 I picked this up without a second thought.  First thought was ""this box is HUGE!""  This is by far the biggest set I've bought. Mine also came with an extra blue rock monster figurine. I really enjoyed the build, it was real neat to watch this one come to life of the course of a few hours 2-3 I forgot to check when I started.  Not sure $100 price tag is fitting.  But if you can find this for the price I found it at then pick it up!!  My only complaints is the two orange ""smoke stacks"" with the fire coming out of them and the ""tool racks"" on either side of the drilling tower. Due to their location they tend to get bumped and therefore have to be re-attached quite a bit, it's easy to do, but a nuisance.  For list price I'd give this set a 4/5 just due to the high price tag, but for the price I found it at  55  10/10  whatever you wanna call it, it was a great purchase.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Trueblox","2019-04-22T21:57:41.223Z","The biggest and the best.","<p>Hello, it&#39;s me, Trueblox, and as i promised, i will review set 8964, Titanium Command Rig from the Power Miners series.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sadly, i don&#39;t own the box yet again, but the front of the 2 manuals, (yes, somehow this set has only 2 manuals) and the back of the manual comes with more information about the newly (at the time) sets that got released. One of the manuals opens horizontally, and the other vertically. Thats about it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build:</p>

<p>Holy pepperoni. This set is H U G E. I mean it. This monster of a mining machine can be both a tower AND a mobile base! Hot dang, It has a crane that holds Glaciator, the blue rock monster. For some reason, no blue crystals are in this set. Big oof for him i guess. The Command Rig has&nbsp;flick-and-fire dynamites and a net launcher. The drill in the front moves as you move it, like almost every Power Miners set.</p>

<p>The figures:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start off with the power miners:</p>

<p>Doc: he&#39;s&nbsp;the &quot;boss&quot; of the power miners crew, and he always appeared in sets with Duke. He has a glass visor this time. His faces are all the same, and he has a sleeved vest with a star on the middle of the vest,</p>

<p>Duke: My favorite version of Duke (And my favorite power miner overall), he&nbsp;comes with some protective glasses that attach to his helmet, he comes with a sleeveless vest, and he has a drill on his torso.</p>

<p>Brains: He&#39;s the smart scientist of the team, He has a white sleeved shirt with a vest that has a test tube on it.</p>

<p>Glaciator: He&#39;s the blue rock monster, and he is being captured by the miners. He&#39;s the leader of the rock monsters (I think, not 100% accurate).</p>

<p>Tremorox: He&#39;s a Big Fig rock monster, with a lever in the back which can make him throw rocks and rock monsters at the Titanium Command Rig, He could cause a lot of damage to the Rig, so much that they would probably need some Flex Tape.</p>

<p>Onto the play features:</p>

<p>Like i said before, as you move the Rig forwards, the drill in the front moves. You can turn the middle part of the Rig into a tower, also revealing a little laboratory in the middle and a crate with a banana. Heck yes.</p>

<p>The crane&nbsp;can move up and down using a lever on the other side, and it works so well, and its so satisfying, my god. The crane can also move left or right&#39;, and the crane tip&nbsp;can&nbsp;move up or down. You can attach the cage that Glaciator is in, and the cage can fit up to 3 rock monsters. There&#39;s a holding space in the Laboratory Room thats inside the Command Rig for the cage, and there&#39;s also an extra holding spot in the very back of the Rig.</p>

<p>Overall opinion: This is a must-get for any Power Miners fans or anyone looking for the best gift for their kid. This set is pure fun and amazement. This is good both as a toy itself and a display. Thanks for reading, have a good day / night!</p>
