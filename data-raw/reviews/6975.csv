"Lanthal","2009-07-02T07:26:37.217Z","A pleasing set offering something a little different.","I found this set  by complete chance this morning on sale for AU$58 which is probably a little on the steep side but cheaper than it will probably retail for.

This is a nice change from the Police and Coast Guard sets that have dominated recent releases, at least in Australia, and the start of what looks like a great line-up for the second half of the year.

Particularly pleasing was little details on the Turbine motor itself with the vents at the back.  The main truck cab is similar to many of the ones that have already been released this year but it actually has doors which was a nice surprise.  

I think a third mini-fig would make it just that bit better - afterall two blokes putting that turbine up alone would be tough - but the two supplied have good face and torso designs.  

The only other real flaw I can think of is that the support van could do with an actual place for the guiding paddle to clip in, you can chuck it in the back under the sign but a designated spot would have been good.   If the price is much higher than $60 than that will also be a negative - even with 2 vehicles.  It is a sticker oriented set - as they all are these days - but I'm not one that is bothered by that.

Not quite a 5 but definitely a 4-4.5 set in my mind.

"dazzay","2009-07-03T12:12:23.03Z","A gem of City 2009","I've just picked this up from a recent offering at one of the Australian stores albeit a pity to see such a great set, like many other sets here, are carried only by an exclusive retailer. More often than not, stock do not get replenished after the first batch, and to add insult to injury, they are sold discounted by non mainstream retailers. In this instance, I had to travel to the banal suburbs instead of city retailers. Lego, if you are reading, please, please rectify this.

Okay to the review. This is the only 2009 City set I've picked up so far. Frankly I'm still partial to the 1990's town/city sets and I find that too many recent sets are recycled ideas with added details (because they are just super-sized).

But wind turbine transport?!  About time Octan diversified into renewable energy resources! Well done. Love the set on the whole - looks, parts, diversity, modularity, design, playability. Though the contents only occupy slightly more than half the box volume. Lego, again if you're reading, consider reducing box sizes - you could be more green i.e. Macbook Pro compact box packaging.  

In a nutshell:
- Truck head is honest; happy with details of front nose, wing mirrors, cabin & storage boxes, colour.
- Trailer; the best part! Trailer length is adjustable via town crane arms. The whole trailer is constructed from parts proper and not a tragic Town Junior one-piece chassis.  Depending on what's transported, the last pair of trailer tyres do not contact the ground due to chassis. Still, I'm very happy with the chassis instead of giant single-piece ones.
- Support vehicle is one of the better recent trucks; it has doors (suddenly such commodity in its comeback) and the hinged warning sign. Good colour too.
- Wind turbine. It has presence (could be taller) and I'm looking at ways to Power Function it ala the special Vestas 4999 set.  Think of this as a mini 4999 turbine. The blade movement is very smooth, so does the rotating body.
- Transportability. Dismantled turbine bits fit perfectly in a considered & realistic manner

Some brickbats:
- Stickers; this set is fine by me as none overlap multiple bricks. Though I find the design i.e. font, colour isnt sophisticated at all (also 7641 City Corner) Lego IMHO needs new graphic designers
- Minifigs are pretty generic. I like the red cap (new design) with an arched visor instead of flat one.  These guys look more like general contractors instead of Octan Energy staff. Or these guys are just stealing the turbine...?
- Why 4x storage boxes behind the truck cabin? There arent tools or anything to be stored in them
- Trailer hitch. I havent bought a set with trailer in a long time. Last i remembered was the ball and socket joint. This set is just an inverted tile with hitch, connected to the truck head.

Overall, this set is worthy every bit & look forward to more Octan Energy sets. Perhaps hydrogen filling station? Solar panel grid? Over to you, Lego.

"jpmanalo","2009-07-08T00:52:51.89Z","More sets like this please!","7747 is a great set; Interesting to build, plenty of playability, and lots of interesting parts for MOC builders. It's also good to see LEGO backing-up their <A HREF=""http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=compact"" TARGET=""_BLANK"">own claims of supporting Principle 8 (""promoting environmental responsibility"") of the United Nations Global Compact</A> by releasing this set. 
 
Skip to the end of this review if you'd like to view a short list of pros and cons. 
 
Availability: 
In the Australian market, set 7747 is (apparently) exclusive to Big-W department stores, and was retailing for AUD$58.98 as at 08-JUL-2009. (Note that LEGO's Recommended Retail Price for 7747 is actually AUD$79.99 in the Australian market). 
 
Given the locations of Big-W stores in Australia, I can understand why certain other reviewers felt they had to go out of their way to pick up a copy of this set (However, I do not think it is nice, though, to refer to the suburbs as ""banal"" - there are plenty of nice people who live in the suburbs!). At least set 7747 is easier to get than set 4999 (Vestas Wind Turbine)! 4999 is not available through regular retail venues. 
 
A number of my AFOL colleagues and myself *suspect* that the reason that certain Big-W stores have run out of stock of set 7747 quite rapidly is due to resellers purchasing stock from Big W to resell on venues such as eBay or Bricklink. 
 
  
Inside the Box: 
When you open the box, you'll find six bags.

* Bag one contains one minifig and the parts for the yellow escort pick-up truck. 

* Bags two, three and four contain the parts for the red transport semi-trailer. Bag two contains one minifig and the parts for the tractor component of the semi-trailer. Bags three and four make up the trailer component of the semi-trailer. 

* Bags five and six contains the parts for the wind turbine. Bag five is for the tower, and bag six is for the actual turbine unit itself. The inclusion of two (hard-to-find) 6 x 12 bright-green plates is quite interesting. 
 
 
Construction: 
 
* The yellow pick-up truck is pretty nifty, and features yellow classic car doors that actually open and close! 
 
* The semi-trailer is a nice solid build - the trailer itself is unlike other official LEGO semi-trailers, in that the trailer chassis is a predominantly brick-built chassis, and *not* a single-piece chassis. Crane arms are used so that the trailer can be extended to a longer length when carrying the win wind turbine blades, or tower that supports the wind turbine. 
 
* The construction of the wind turbine itself is quite straight-forward, and not at-all too complicated. The turbine unit can rotate through 360 degrees on top of the tower - just like the real thing. 
 
 
Comparison between set 7747 and set 4999: 
 
AFOLs and others are most likely to be interested in comparisons between this set and set 4999, Vestas Wind Turbine. Besides obvious differences (e.g. there is a truck in set 7747, and a house in set 4999), key differences between this set and 4999 are: 
 
* The wind turbine in set 7747 is smaller in size when compared to the wind turbine in set 4999. A good real-life comparison would be to look at <A HREF=""http://scruss.com/talks/02006/bcs/pics/vestas-turbine_size.jpg"" TARGET=""_BLANK"">this image of different Vestas wind turbines</A> - set 4999 would be equivalent to a V90 wind turbine, whilst 7747 is closer to a V19 or V20 wind turbine. 
 
* Set 4999 is motorised with a Power Functions 'M' motor. There is *no* motor in set 7747 (however, it would be feasible to motorise the turbine in 7747 with additional parts). 
 
* Set 4999 includes a number of rare/uncommon parts, including four (4) BURPs (part number 6082) in Green. 
 
* Set 7747 is available through regular retail venues (albeit only one actual retail-chain as at July 2009). Set 4999 was only produced as a one-off special edition for employees of Vestas. 
 
Summary: 
 
A great set; Interesting to build, plenty of playability, and lots of interesting parts for MOC builders. LEGO Group - please produce more quality sets like this!
 
Pros: 
* Interesting parts (e.g. part 61484 in red, bright green 6 x 12 plates) 
* Classic car doors (parts 3821 and 3822) in yellow and red! 
* Semi-trailer is brick-built! No fancy single-piece/single-use molds! 
* Cheaper (and easier to obtain!) than set 4999 
* Good to see a LEGO City set that isn't within an emergency services theme
* It's a wind-turbine! :-) 
 
 
Cons (negatives): 
* Recommended Retail Price is a bit steep. Try and get it below AUD$60.00 if you can.
* As at July 2009, 7747 is only available from one retailer in Australia (Big-W). 
* Not as big as set 4999 (7747 is still sized convincingly though).

Great set apart from tower being too short so I doubled the height using 2 sets. 

Just had a LEGO layout on show at the Taupo NZ Hobby Show (see flickr) with 2 wind turbines motorised with the red micro motor and a train controller to slow rotation.  Plus a convoy of 4 trucks carrying the various sections for another.

Would have rated it a 5 but for the short tower causing the blades yo be too close to the ground. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

Some different types of builds than I have seen before and great ideas in regards to the trailer bed of the truck.  The wind turbine itself is just cool to have towering in the background of your city...however they should make it so you could get multiple turbines...one of these things will not power an entire city....
I spoke with the resident builder at the store and he showed me how he had modified his turbine to be used with the power functions unit....plenty of room on the interior of the column to run the wiring...just have to remove the blue pieces on the interior...you may lose a little stability but not much...this set is a must have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I have to agree with the other reviewers that the pillar is too short, it just seems to low to the ground for the size of the blades. 

The truck is nice over all, though two areas I have issues with is the storage boxes that have nothing to store in (they could have at least given us a couple of road cones like the ones from the new construction sets, since those seem to be popular extras), and the piece to attach the blades to for transport (when your not using it and try to move it to the location shown in the manual it does not sit centered since you are attaching a odd numbered stud to a even number stud location).

The Pace car is great save for the fact that I keep pulling my caution sign off every time i flip it up. I'm not sure if the hinge piece just doesn't want to stay connected or if the hinge itself just needs to be used more to loosen up.

This is a great set over all and a must have! I only took off one point since all my issues are relatively small ones but do add up.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Krogh","2010-01-17T20:09:23.67Z","A real Danish Heavy Hauler.","I've read a couple of the reviews for this set, everyone seems to give the set a glowing review, and a top grade. But not me!

So, why don't you like this set, you might think, but the fact is, i do! Or, at least i like the idea of the set.

As many of the others say, the windmill is too short, don't place it next to any buildings! But other than that, i think it falls apart waaay to easy, it brakes away from the base plate just by light touch, and the joints for the wings are not much better. It is lightweight, and it generelly feels really flimsy. It would have been way better if it was motorized to.

The trailer is flawed in it's design. When driving, only the front wheels are touching the ground, it is fixable but i think it's a really big design flaw. And as mentioned by another reviewer, the holder for the windmill is not centered when placing it according to the manual. This would give a tipsy side-heavy load in real life, and when transporting something like a windmill, this would not be good. It is also way to flexible and feels flimsy over all. I also think it could have been more detailed.

The 2 redeeming qualities of this set, is the tractor cab, and the car.

The cab is built more or less like we would build a real heavy load truck here in Denmark, with a high rear end, big solid cabinets, a coffee mug and all. Although the cabinets are great, you get nothing to put in them, wich i think is weird. But all in all, the cab is the best part of this set! :)

The little car is also well designed, nothing much to say about it, i generelly like it.

The set also comes with 2 minifigs, great as always.

With a fair bit af modification to the trailer, and the mill, it can be an awesome addition to your city, but, as it is, i just would not recommend it. As i said, i like the idea of the set, but it could have been realised much better. It has so much potential.

Another thing is, that for what you actually get, it is waaay to expensive. I paid more for this, than i did for the 7642 garage. Now granted, the garage was on sale, but you get the idea.

So, i will give the set a generous 3/5.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
