"Chaz777","2009-05-18T11:46:44.263Z","I know you don't want to hear it but...","...this set dosn't live up to the mountain of hype surrounding it. Now unlike the other two reviewers of this set, I actually own it, I got it along with 7641 (Street corner) when the new summer sets came to UK TRU early in April and I was ridiculously exited on the way home, I couldn't believe my luck that I got my hands on two must-have sets early. Then when I built the car... anticlimax.
There's nothing really wrong with it, but nothing that innovates, either. Lego played it very safe with this one, which is fine, because I'd be the first to complain if they did something really drastic, but it needs something more. In the 80's, you could open lego car doors, sometimes lift the bonnet, and 6672 even had suspension. So now, more than 20 years later, to have a car which can do none of these things seems to me like a big step backwards.
And to top it all off, when complete, above the steering wheel is the top of an ORANGE brick. If the brick was black or blue then it would have been hard to spot, but orange really stands out. More thought needed, Lego.
Now you're probably wondering why I've given this set four stars, because I'm making it seem like I hate this set, which I don't, I think it's good lego have started releasing civillian sets, it's a step in the right drection, I just think they could have taken a few more steps.
Plus points, though, and first off, aside from the strange ommision of something to cover that orange brick, this car is, quite frankly, stunning. All the contours around the boot flow seamlessly together and with that front grill, you can almost hear that V8 growling.
Plus, you also get the old style round tree (good to see you, old friend), which is always nice to have in a town, the minifig isn't too common which is good to see, and the emergency phone booth thing does it's job. So all in all, This car is nothing special, it has no frills and no-one will remember it in 20 years time, but if you're looking for a cheap impulse buy, or just another vehicle to flesh out your town, this muscle car will do just fine.

"chantastic","2009-07-24T00:56:43.827Z","vroom vroom!","This is a nifty little US$10 model. For about the price of a lunch you get a neat little sports roadster, a cubicle dwelling office worker minifig ready for his weekend trip (this is the first minifig I've ever identified with, being an office worker myself), a nice little tree, and a callbox. The car itself is pretty simple. I was almost able to put it together without the instructions. The control panel for the callbox is printed so there are no stickers. The car itself is sturdy and compact - maybe too small as it only seats 1 fig (no room for his girlfriend) and there is no trunk (boot for the U.K. readers) for storage. 

I'll probably bring this to work and put it on my desk so I can daydream about all the road trips I should be taking.

My one complaint is that when the driver is seated in the car, the top of his head peeks over the windshield. And the office worker fig should have come with a mug or a briefcase. But then again, there's nowhere in the car to put any of that stuff.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

First, it's a red car (not to many of red cars around). Secondly, it actually fits into my city unlike most Cars which are either to big or to small.  Also it is very durable, I have dropped it on a wood floor, and not to many pieces fell off.

"AlterBrick__Vienna__Austria","2009-08-06T18:42:16.03Z","Best value 4 little money","This is not a big set. But it brings some specials:

The tree is unique at present - it was rather common in the past - so it is his ""comeback show"" - good idea, TLG! Why waste x parts to build a tree - 1 part suffices (Waiting 4 the small & normal needle tree not only in very rare set 4999 and the most wanted, elegant cypress tree!!)

The minifig is a business man with a neck tie and a suit - pretty rare in comparison to legions of construction workers eg.

Then you get this telephone hand set, which is a very universal part needed in each LEGO house, but pretty rare.

The convertible sportscar is ok - someone thought it is a mustang but I believe it has its engine in the back due to a grill behind the driver's seat of and it is red: Hence it must be a Ferrari http://www.carsdiecast.com.au/images/bst9228.jpg

PROS:
Very easy to build, even for a $10 set.

Although I thought they were obsolete ""in real life"", the phone booth/stand is pretty cool.  The phone comes off and the mini-fig can hold it.

The tree is a nice solid one-piece.

Vehicle rolls on almost all surfaces very well (even carpet).

Vehicle is very sturdy - you really have to try to get pieces to come off.

The smurk on the mini-figs face cracks me up every time I see it.

CONS:
I'm used to getting several mini-figs in a $10 set, so another fig or another tree would have been nice.

Would have preferred something moving on the car (besides the wheels), like a door and/or the trunk or hood.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The convertible is well built and fits the smug, metro mini-fig.  It is truly a sports car with its ground-effects and large tires with a long hood.

This set includes a tree (rarely added in sets these days) and is a nice addition.

The phone booth was designed perfectly.

As the box shows, this mini-fig pushed the car too hard and it overheated (thus the phone booth) - when you add the Tow Truck set (7638), it all comes together.

It's nice to see that this year, Lego have begun to introduce civilian-themed City sets.  Occasionally in the past, Lego have been known to design quite unrealistic-looking vehicles, so I'm glad that they've did well with this one.

Two down points would be the lack of roof, and a simplistic interior.  Of course, it's easy to add something yourself to increase the aesthetic of the dashboard, so you can't really knock too many marks off for it.

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-09-02T04:05:41.81Z","Sports Car and a Smirk…","Another 2009 birthday present and a great addition to the collection.   Isn’t it amazing how the Lego City cars are getting longer, wider and smoother than those of past years.   I remember thinking that the older car sets (2880 / 6501 / 6530 / 6627) were great and a welcome addition to the empty streets of the city, but the new vehicles really do look more realistic and appealing.

The set contains the red sports convertible, a roadside emergency telephone in booth and a tree, a familiar sight in the 90’s sets.   The sports car is smooth and sporty in appearance and comes complete with stylish grill and headlights, a smooth bonnet with a gradual slope and sports-style windscreen.   No doors are provided; the driver must hop over the sides of the car to get in.   The small cabin features a steering wheel but no dashboard panel or display tile just a plain orange block!   The rear section of the car depicts where the hood would fold away to and again is presented in smooth red tiles.   The wheel arches are oversized and feature white wheels with wide black tyres.   The minifig provided depicts a young executive with shirt, tie and waistcoat, with a smirk on his face!   The land-based items are the old-style tree and an emergency telephone booth.   The telephone booth features an orange ‘light’ along with telephone panel and telephone receiver.

A few small niggles aside, this is a great set, it’s stylish and appealing and makes a great addition to driveway or City Street.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brixton","2009-09-13T16:14:28.043Z","Zoom Zoom ","The new lego traffic sets are bigger and better than the older ones.  This sports car is a bit longer and a bit wider than a lego van I have from a set dating back to 1993.  The newer sets also contain more specialized pieces that are suited for that particular theme set.  The minifigure looks great and so does the sports car itself.  I like the lights on the car even though it doesn't seem as secure as older designs.  With frequent use there is the risk of the lights falling off and getting lost.

The set comes with a nice little emergency phone which is a nice addition to a lego city.  With some modifications it can be turned into a phone booth.  The tree is also a welcome piece as it can be added to your lego city.  The set would have been better with a couple of road plates.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Was quick and easy to put together but is a unique piece in my collection. Haven't gotten a set since 2002 so I jumped at this for under $5. The set came with about five extra pieces which is fantastic. I have lost quite a few pieces to other sets over the years so getting a few extra bits doesn't bother me in the least.

"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-08-07T21:50:27.947Z","Nothing exciting, but still pretty good to have","<p>I got this set at the very first LEGO store in Canada. Although I wasn't planning on buying anything while there (until Christmas), I eventually bought something, as a reminder of my first trip ever to&nbsp;a LEGO store. Because I didn't want to buy anything large, I chose this set, which was the perfect size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The construction began right when I arrived home. It took no more than ten minutes and&nbsp; it was very straightforward. Nothing special there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you finish building, you have (besides the convertable, which I'll get to shortly)&nbsp;a business person, roadside telephone, and my favourite, a rare tree piece. These are great additions&nbsp;for any Lego city. The buttons on the telephone panel, however, look more like&nbsp;the dashboard for a space ship!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And last but not least, you have the convertable. Overall it is well-designed. The hood&nbsp;at the front piece makes the convertable sleekier. There&nbsp;are new sloped grille pieces that make up the front. The rear would be less empty if there was a license plate there. The windshield is pretty cool as well. There is a random 1x2 orange brick in front of the steering wheel which serves no purpose. However, it is an excellent place to add a dashboard, so I don't see any problem with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't stop noticing how much the front of the convertable sticks out once it is built. Traditionally, the&nbsp;back of a vehicle is supposed to stick out more than the front.&nbsp;As a result, it looks like the front of the convertable is actually the back. I might have given&nbsp;the set four stars for this, but I don't really mind, because the convertable still looks good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, it is a great set. What I like most about this set is that you don't have to buy another expensive set just for the car, the car is sold separately at a cheaper price. At $12.99 CDN the price is alright, but for 68 pieces it could've been slightly cheaper. Nonetheless, if you want to add another car for your city, I would reccomend this set.</p>

Cons:
1. Just lame, nothing really to do with it
2. When you try to race it, most (MOST, not always, but most) of the time it randomly turns and you will definetely loose to something bigger, such as a truck.
3. Limited playablitly

I think you'll find that this set is a pretty good set for the money you spend on it, some stores around me still have plenty of it in stock and you can't go wrong this close to the holidays picking up some cheap little sets to tease the kiddies with before they open the really big box with... Well whatever larger LEGO set is hidden within.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if they like LEGO City then they'll love this little addition to their collection. You may even find it on sale at certain outlets. I definitely recommend this set to all City fans.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"CRACKOTATOE","2010-12-01T17:19:11.327Z","Not speeding now, are we?","<p>Ok so this car is set no. 8402. The car is a nice red design, a mercifull departure from all the yellow vehicles we get mostly. Some people don't like the orange brick behind the steering wheel, but I just popped in a red one and voila!</p>
<p>The minifigure is cool. The only complaint I have about him is that LEGO release too many of his body and hair, their everywhere! That hairpiece is way overused, but on with the show.</p>
<p>The phonebooth is a really nice addition to any town, but I'm not entirely sure about the orange 1x1 round there. The tree is super cool, not often we see them in&nbsp;CITY either.</p>
<p>The car is the best part (obviously). It's sleek and looks as though it's ready to whip through the air. The engine at the back is nice and theres no doors, but who needs doors with a car like this? Just jump in! The only con with the car is the sticky-out wheels that we see in every LEGO vehicle. They should really find a way to stop that. It makes the car seem fat and slow, but apart from that is really nice!</p>
<p>I'd recommend it any day, and at I think 7 Euro it's a good deal too.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"coldcomfort","2011-01-04T01:14:03.45Z","8402 Sports Car - Includes the most eligible bachelor in your Lego City.","<p>I picked this up on a lark because it was marked down to $8.47 at my local Kmart (you may want to investigate yours if you have one, as there were still four or five of this set at mine when I bought it). I only recently began building Lego models again after a 20 year hiatus and I have to say that Lego has come a long, LONG way in terms of detail and aesthetics in those two decades. Back in my day (delivered in my best shaky old man voice) Lego vehicles were small, narrow and blocky. This car is low, long and sleek.</p><p>A quick look at our driver gives us some information that paints a picture. He's smartly dressed in a tie and a vest (I like to think that the matching jacket is in the trunk were he stowed it on the way out of the office because it was such a beautiful day) suggesting that not only is he gainfully employed, but it's probably a decent paying job to boot. He wears a slightly cocky, impish grin which combined with his youthful mop top haircut tell us that while he's old enough to know better, he's still young enough not to care. Last, and of the most obvious importance, he's got the coolest car in town! Lego ladies watch out, this one's a cad on the prowl.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great design, completely reinvents what I expect from Lego vehicles.<br></li><li>Interesting accessories that really help round out my city.<br></li><li>This set just radiates FUN! Even if, like me, you don't really ""play"" with your Legos in the traditional sense you'll be hard pressed to avoid pushing this around the table a few times.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>At first glance it's a great set at the price point ($10 US), but when you do the math it comes out to just under 15 cents American per piece. This is a little more than I like to pay for most of the items found in this set (and I didn't, as noted I got it on sale for $8.47 US). However, I must acknowledge that this small objection is pretty well offset by the inclusion of special elements such as the tree, the phone receiver and the special car parts.<br></li><li>As mentioned in another review, the hair and torso of the included minifigure are becoming increasingly common and it would be really nice to see some different styles introduced soon.<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is a great set that I was more than happy to add to my City. You really can't go wrong at the price point, but it's even better if you can find it on sale/clearance. I may buy one or two more so I can put the cars in the dealership I'm building and the phones can go to the bus station. Everybody should get at least one of these.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

Well worth the money, but not much play value unless you have the airport and/or garage. (I have both.) Now on to the pros and cons.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Great minifig</p>
<p>Nice car</p>

"Mask_of_Control","2019-08-28T16:20:20.817Z","Good set to improve a Lego City!","<p>I receive this set in 2009 and I think it&#39;s a good set.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>&raquo; Good minifigure.</p>

<p>&raquo; Good vehicle.</p>

<p>&raquo; Good accessories.</p>

<p>&raquo; Good play value.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p>&raquo; Nothing.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>This&nbsp;set is a good way to improve a Lego City. The design of the car is great and the accessories are good to especially the tree&nbsp;because Lego no longer produces trees like that and because it&#39;s a good addition to a Lego City.</p>

<p>I recommend buying this set if you are looking for cheap ways to improve&nbsp;a Lego City.</p>
