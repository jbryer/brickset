"YnO","2009-07-20T10:09:20.937Z","The ultimate set!","I just recently rediscovered Lego after close to 20 years, and fortunately for me it was through this set. It immediately got me hooked again and during the following week I ended up buying three more sets.
I got myself the big bulldozer, the big black tow truck and a tractor with a pneumatic digging arm. They were all fun to build, but none came close to this model. 

Both the attention to detail that make it look magnificent and the engineering capabilities (four individual functions working in both directions with one engine) is outstanding and makes this a model I think it will be a lot of fun modifying to add more functions and remote control capabilities.

As I had not done any Lego building since technics still mainly were bricks, I initially was a little sceptical to custom parts and the beams. This is completely wrong. In this truck everything serves it's purpose perfectly and it is just the exterior that has a few shaped parts that gives it the finish it deserves. The rest is still pure technics lego marvel.

The instructions are very good and although the model is complex, there was no problem understanding were things should go (even after 20 years of not building).

To me this set will be the reference until I find one that give me as much fun. I think I will have to wait for the next big thing they release :-)

"cybergibbons","2009-08-01T06:14:40.153Z","Complex, fun build, slightly flimsy, open for modifications","This is my re-introduction to Lego Technic after a 15 year break from it, and my first studless kit. I bought the kit on a whim as a birthday treat to myself.

This model is brilliantly complex and a joy to build. The instructions really are very clear and logical. There's some interesting new parts such as the H-frames and long racks which are used to great effect.

The build starts off with the intricate, tightly packed, and well thought out central gear box. This has two levers to control the drive train on one side, and the PF motor switch on the other. There's a wealth of bevel gears and clutch gears inside here.

The chassis gradually gets built up and onto the 4 wheel steering. This uses gearing to ensure that the front wheels turn more than the rear - I'm not sure if this is in perfect proportion or not. It's controlled by the hand of god wheel on top of the cab, through the rather strange knobbley gears. The drive has quite a lot of flex and backlash in it, so the steering only really works on a very smooth surface.

Only one pair of the rear wheels are driven through a differential.

Then you moved onto build the outriggers. Clever design with the new racks means these are really compact. The dropping of the actual feet is manual unfortunately, and they aren't nearly strong enough to lift the model.

The engine and cab are next. This is really quite realistic, and doesn't use nearly as many custom parts as I thought. The cab tips forward to allow you to look at the engine. The steering wheel is non-functional.

After this, construction moves onto the arm. This uses two of the linear actuators which are driven entirely through the turntable. This uses the driving rings around a axle to allow two independent motions to be transmitted.

The linear actuators control the raising of both sections of the arm. You need to do these in the right order or horrible grinding noises ensue.

The extension of the arm and the winch are entirely manual.

The arm, unfortunately, is very flexible and cannot reach very far outside of the truck itself, which is quite limiting.

It's too easy to make the arm hit parts of the model and retract in the wrong order.

But it is a very impressive piece of engineering, and quite fun to play with.

You can dismount the arm really easily and the model looks more like a normal truck.

I've not tried the B-model - the instructions aren't provided in the box so you need to use a PC or print them yourself.

I'm left wanting to modify the model to make it better:
*Fully automatic outriggers - I've worked out a way of doing this, but they are much bigger, so the chassis will need changing to accommodate. I'd like to use rubber bands to drive the front and back independently so they can extend by different amounts.
*Geared steering - I'd rather have to turn the handle more times and have more positive steering.
*Powered transmission - this is a heavy model and I think it would need to have both rear axles driven to work.
*Arm improvements - I'd like to stiffen the arm, and power the winch. I've worked out a way of getting three independent drives through a turntable, but it won't fit into this model, so I need to come at this from another direction. My plan is to have both linear actuators and the extension powered by one shaft, with the 3 happening sequentially (lower raise, upper raise, extend). This means the arm will always end up in a fixed position, but can still slew. Then the other drive would be used for the winch.

All in all, a good fun set, but maybe just not strong enough for any real play value.

"Starstreak","2009-08-10T01:20:47.937Z","It's a good set if you have the money.","I did a full review with video and pictures here:
http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=32170

Final part of the review:

Comments
This build was pretty easy considering the 1800 pieces, and that I had to dump them all into a drawer without sorting. 
There was a couple of this that I ran into. Some are problems, others are just things I didn't know. 
1) The rotation of the crane. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't always rotate.
2) I pulled hairs trying to figure out why I couldn't make the crane fold into a compact state like in the final photo. It turned out that if you put these yellow pegs ""Yellow Technic Engine Crankshaft"" in wrong on the upper crane arm, it will actually stop it from folding completely. The instructions isn't too clear on the how the part is to be put on. See picture above.
3) I don't like the boxed in area for the crane. You can't 360 degree rotate the crane without bumping into the cage.
4) I mentioned before the crane line and final extension on the crane is manual. You need to use your hand to raise and lower the line and extend and retract the extender.
5) The stabilizers have manual legs on them. Once you extend the stabilizers, you need to lower the legs on each one by hand.

My rating:
Playability: 4/5. This set is very playable. A few minor bugs, but still fun. It won't lift anything heavy, but you can pretend. :)
Design: 4/5. Being the biggest Technic set of the year, they did a good job. But a few minor problems like the crane not being able to rotate 360 degree when folded, bothered me. Then again, maybe the real rig you could only compact it and not rotate it to save space.
Build experience: 5/5. Comparing it to other Technic sets, this is... harder. No bags are marked so everything is in one big pile. Just the way I like it. I want a challenge. But still, finding out that yellow piece was backwards was a pain. As I mentioned, it's not clear in the instructions.
Overall: 4/5. This set was over $140. Price per part is a good deal when compared to lets say a Star Wars set. And this set is very playable. If you don't like Technic line then it may not be for you, but the overall rating is based on if you were actually looking for this set.

"kostasm13","2009-09-20T09:28:34.857Z","Great Technic set with lots of functions","With one word: Amazing!
Just one motor, but so many functions!
It was very challenging to build, especially the first part,
with all the axles and gears stuck in little space.
Unlike #8285 (Tow Truck), it is very solid, even in the rear part where there are lesser pieces.
That's thanks to the frame pieces (I don't know how they officially called) which created great stability.
It tried to make the doors open, but some parts were unstable, so I built the doors as they were original.
I bought #8870 Led Light Set and it's gonna be very beautiful.
This and #8421 (Mobile Crane) are the best Techinc sets I have ever built.

I found this an epic build! Extremely fun to build, and I love the complexity of the gearbox that controls all the functions! The resulting truck is large, and holds together very well. For such a long truck there is very little sag in the middle.

The truck also looks very nice! The use of panels and stickers makes it one of the builds that are going to be showed off on my shelves! :) 

On my build all the functions work perfectly and tucking away the crane is no problem, once you know the technique. Playing with the crane is real fun, and the beefy look makes it one of my favourite cranes so far! There is a safetyfeature built into the crane arm that will pop out if the strain gets too much. And it makes an ugly noise doing it. Why they don't use the regular white torque-cogs I don't know, but they might give out too soon. 

The sheer amount of pieces that makes out the truck is wild, I had a whole bowl with just the small black connectorpieces and another with just blue connectors when I started out.

I built it slow because I didnt met before studless and PF parts. Everything works well in the model. There are some little problem: rear stabillizers are weak and there is a difference between the steering angle of the axles. The gearbox is very complex it was hard to build it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jamal_lts","2009-10-31T09:41:27.23Z","The Most Complex Set EVER.","This has to be the most complex set ever in Technic history. With only one  motor driving 4 functions, the gears, axles and clutch arrangement are a wonder to fix up and it all started with the first book. I guess u have to start with this with full concentration. If this was done in the later parts of the book, i would have been quite tired to follow everything correctly.

However, I would certainly like to see the outriggers stablize the truck without doing it manually at the end. It comes out automatically, but instead of having to manually bring it down, why not it unfolds itself for a steadfast footing on the ground.

Warning:

You have to put in batteries as instructed when building the set. The ending parts requires you to extend the outriggers, which cannot be done manually as the motor is already engaged. 

But what you can do , if its already too late, is to pull out the mudflaps and tilit the truck cab so you have a clearing to fix in the front outriggers. The back ones are fairly easy with a slight angle to the fix.

The crane section is really superb. Just looking at the crane arms folding and unfolding is just an awed sight. Especially, when it comes to the leverage needed to fold it inwards. A great modification would be adding a motor to the crane section to make the reeling in and out much easier.

TIP: to turn it around manually, take out the smaller gear of the two which is located at the base nearer to the frame at the back of the truck. This small gear frees the big gear from the being engaged to the motor. Now you turn the crane when idle without using batteries when displaying it.

The rest of the truck are standard contstructions, but the worth of the effort is fixing the crane and the gearings in an excellent and new way.

"Lexhoya","2009-11-02T14:59:19.7Z","Just as big, just as cool...","I own a few sets now, but just as the 8285, this is a large one. Just bought it on Legoworld in NL (€110), love it, couldn't wait to get home :-)
The building of the gearbox takes almost 2 booklets (with parts of the frame). This means you have to wait quite a while before you can see some result on how the truck is going to look like. Nevertheless, the build took me 4,5 hrs (in total) which is no fooling around, no playing around, just picking up pieces and continue building, drinking some coffee and finalizing the build at 2AM.

The only downside to this set (as opposed to the Tow Truck) is that the B-model needs to be printed manually after you download the PDF's :( I know this is to save the environment (or something), but now I need to print it myself... Still need to build that one, but first I want to enjoy the presence of this set.
And one other thing is that the boom and lineair actuators can not handle large loads. The movement is cool, that's for sure, but any load will 'stop' the clutch-wheels. Maybe making then gear down a bit, keeps the strength in the set.

"mensink","2009-12-20T11:42:47.093Z","Very big, very complex","After building the 8275 (motorized bulldozer) a year ago, I only built the smaller 8261 (rally truck) in the meantime, so I was really looking forward to building a complex model.

And yes, this model really is complex enough. Of course, building with the instructions is not really that hard. I find that I spend more time gathering the needed pieces than putting them together. The number of parts is enormous, so it pays off doing some sorting before you begin.

First, what I really like about this box:
- The vast number of pieces, and the variety of them. If you like to design your own models like I do, you'll have no regrets here. There are loads and loads of gears and other fancy but useful parts.
- There are some really nice engineering examples in this model, like smart ways to gear up/down, or the extending outriggers.
- Some great features are offered. The model steers, has extending outriggers, and a reasonably capable crane.
- The resulting model looks really impressive.

Some things I didn't like so much:
- You start off building the gearbox, but you have to wait until the end to see it do its magic. Because of the way you have to build it, and that it's entirely contained within the body later on, I didn't know what was going on there until I opened it up again (right after finishing it, yes), and even now it's not 100% clear to me what happens everywhere.
- Like the 8275, they had to give this model an 'engine'. I mean the grey thing with the yellow things popping in/out when driving the truck. Where it didn't add much to the 8275, with this model I consider it absolutely pointless. The thing is located right below the cabin and it's almost not visible when driving the truck. Unless of course you open up the cabin, but who drives a truck with an open cabin?
- The crane is OK but far from awesome. I'm not keen on the way the crane is operated, because it basically gets in the way of the controls, or my hands get in the way of the crane. Also, within a couple of minutes I managed to mess up one of the switches. Probably this was due to a fault of my own while constructing or something.

Altogether this is a great buy, and though the default model has its quirks, there are still a lot of great features in it. And the huge amount of parts are great for the creative builder.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"darkmyble2008","2010-01-11T19:19:26.513Z","Fantastic!","In years gone by I've owned quite a few Technic Lego sets and was keen for my just turned 13 year old son to do the same. After buying him 8264, 8292 and 8294 and of course helping him I sat and wondered was there a set out there that  would satisfy a veritable elder at 35 years old. 

Indeed there was, this the massive 8251 Crane Truck. I sat at the kitchen table and in 6 hours (and a few coffees) built it completely. Technically it was very different to all the sets I'd ever built before, but having built some sets with my son I found the transition from old to new quite easy.

I wouldn't say this set is for the faint hearted.. you have to be really into Technic to appreciate the complexity of it's design and engineering prowess, but with a logical and methodical approach even my 8 year old son was capable of completing some sections.

I also found my imagination working overtime, wondering how I could motorise all of the working parts and set to work making the Truck drive and steer.. I noticed that in the cab above the engine there would be enough space for a motor and with a few slight adjustments, managed to attach one.. it now drives forward and backwards.. of course it will be better when I have received the remote and IR sensors to fully establish remote functionality. 

One thing is for sure this set engages you, drives you, and once complete gives you a wonderful sense of achievement and to top it all off it's way bigger than any of the other sets we currently own.

All in all this set is amazing and a must for anyone who is an avid builder/collector.

PS This set inspired me so much, that today I have purchased the Lego Technic Mobile Crane 8421 and oh my gosh was it expensive! I look forward to receiving it and letting you guys know how I get on.

<p>It look realy weel, many nice fetures and lots of part making it look corectly. The size is realy nice to. The look realy rasing the over all score quite a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Function - Platform</h4>
<p>Many things remins of the 8421 crane in many ways. Stering and suport woks in the same way. The 8421 steers at 3 axels, the 8258, onely 2. The suport on the 8421 is controled from the lever, but on the 8258 the have to be manipulated sperate to. The XL motor and battery pack is nicly integrated and give the truck a great powerboast, but the batterypack is realy hard to remove for battery change.</p>
<p>8421 is more functionaly but the 8258 looks great, all over a combination of the 8421 function with the looks and the powerpack from the 8258 is probobly the ultimate crance platform.</p>

<h4><b>Function - Crane</b></h4>
<p>Again, the 8258 looks great, the folding cran is realy nice to look at, but the 8421 works a loot better. The linar acturators is quite strong, but the are just to complex to make it nice. Ther is way to many sprockets and moving parts. Its realy hard to build, and its quite boring to play with.</p>
<p>Sure in a tecnical view its realy advance but its just no point to it. Making the two linear actuators work trow the turntable is realy impressive with about 20sprockets just to make it work.

"Wiseman_2","2011-01-10T16:31:59.59Z","Brilliant in almost all aspects","<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><h4>Introduction</h4>2009, and Technic gives us a flagship that was almost unrivalled in complexity and size amongst almost any set. It is still not the largest Technic set, and it has since been surpassed in complexity by the magnificent 8043, but it is still a set that any self-respecting Technic fan should have in their collection. I'll break the rest of the review down into relevant sections and also cover the B-Model for sake of ease.<br><br><h4>A-Model - Crane Truck</h4>The Crane Truck is an excellently designed model; a large eight wheeler with a rotating crane function, stabalisers and four wheel steering. Oh, and a V8 engine block.<br><br>The build starts with the central gearbox. It is brilliantly designed and operates on all three perpendicular axis; axles follow the length of the truck, the width and the vertical, allowing control of the four motorised functions via two switching rings. It is built very cleverly and is probably the best part of the build - but that is not to say the rest of it is dull.<br>Following the gearbox, the rest of the chassis is built. It is simple but well done, held together well, and yet it is still possible to take it apart without trouble when dismantling.<br>The stabalisers come next - they are modular-like in design, as the front and rear are practically identical. The cab is built next and the truck almost looks done.<br>The crane is the final part of the build. It looks very good in any position and the yellow contrasts nicely with the red of the truck.<br><br>The final model looks very good. It is huge and well scaled. The playability is very good, as you would expect for a flagship. The gearbox is controlled from the left side of the truck - a panel hides the switches on one side, while on the right the polarity switch is hidden. The crane's elevation is slow but representative of the real thing, and allows precision. The linear actuators are brilliant for this. The stabalisers are also extended by motor. However, the motor is not able to telescope the crane, deploy the hook, or lower the stabaliser feet. This is of course impossible to do, as only two functions can be passed through a turntable, and it's not possible (using ""legal"" Lego build techniques) to motorise the feet. So it is excusable.<br><br>Overall, the Crane Truck is a superb model. The build is interesting throughout with almost no repetition (hard to do in a set of 1800+ pieces) and looks brilliant, with great functionality and a nice, complex design. The crane is not the strongest but it is a good representation of the real thing. Overall, I would give it 5/5.<br><br><h4>B-Model - Duty Wrecker</h4>As is typical of Technic sets, there is a B-model which can be assembled with instructions downloaded from the internet. It is naturally limited by the parts available, but manages to include a winch, steering, V8 engine, and a motorised bucket lift on the trailer.<br>The build begins with the front truck. It is large but simple, with little in the way of any complexity beyond the engine and steering. The winch, at first glance, looks like it might be controlled from a remote point, due to the 24-tooth gear next to the 12-tooth double bevel gear. Alas, that is only for decor, as it is operated directly from the front, so no complexity there.<br>Following the truck, the trailer is built. It is more interesting and includes a simple gearbox for operating the bucket lift. The build is good here with a frame and chassis built around the gearbox, then the lift built on top.<br><br>Once built, the Duty Wrecker looks almost as good as the Crane Truck. The stickers - which I added - do detract slightly in places, but improve it in others (expecially on the lift). It is a shame the winch must be operated from the point next to it, as it is quite fiddly. Still, it is a nice feature to have. The trailer has stablisers which are manually controlled, but are quite nice in that they lock over centre, so they will not back pedal. The bucket lift functions similiarly to the crane, except that the upper LA is used to telescope the bucket instead of lifting a boom. The LA cannot extend very far and I cannot help but think that the use of a gear rack would have resulted in further telescoping; it could have easily been done.<br><br>Overall, the Duty Wrecker is a very good model in its own right. As a B-Model, it is probably amongst the best Technic have done, which could in part be due to the large part selection available. It is not as functional or complex as the Crane Truck, but is still interesting and well worth building. Overall, 4/5.<br><br><h4>Parts</h4>As far as parts packs go, 8258 is one of the best in a while. For a start, there are 1877 of them, and there are a good variety too. There are lots of the new (for 2009) panels, which make the truck look brilliant. There are loads of beams of all sizes, and some new (for 2009) H-beams and square beams. There are a lot of gears, including a lot of 16-tooth idler gears, and 3 rare white 24-tooth clutch gears. There is an XL Motor with a polarity switch and a battery box, with two linear actuators. It also includes 7 of the new 13L gear racks, which are also nice parts.<br><br><h4>Value for Money</h4>At £129.99, 8258 is one of the pricier flagships of the last decade. Prices have naturally increased, and when you consider the inclusion of PF parts, the price isn't so bad; it is a £40 increase on 8285 from 2006 (the spiritual predecessor to this set: designed by the same person, same part count, simliar vehicle type), but includes PF and is, in my opinion, much better. It's still expensive if bought by someone who only occasionally buys Technic sets.<br><br><h4>Overall</h4>I cannot recommend this set enough. As far as the models go, the Crane Truck is superb, and the B-Model is a very good alternative to prolong the enjoyment you will get. The build experience is excellent and teaches some interesting techniques to those only used to small sets. It is also a great source of parts and at a fairly reasonable price if you are a Technic fan.<br><br>Uwe Wabra has designed an outstanding set. Buy it now while you still can! Thanks for reading.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"aldredd","2014-07-21T16:16:27.12Z","One of the most interesting & exciting technic sets produced","<p>This set holds a certain place in my emotional mindset - after coming out from the &#39;dark ages&#39; and building a large collection, I had to sell it all up after starting a family - and this was the set which was about to be released at the time.</p>

<p>Fast forward 5 years, and I&#39;m amassing my collection again - and although I bought this set as part of a large batch job&nbsp;of used sets, I&#39;d been holding off as long as I could muster - so building it was something a little special for me (ok, yes, I&#39;m sad - I don&#39;t care :o) )</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is a large set, on the same scale as the unimog and mobile cranes. At 1,877 pieces, it&#39;s joint 4th largest set. For your money, you get some PF parts (xl motor ,switch) and&nbsp;11 &#39;frame / box&#39; beams but mostly a good mix of beams, panels, gears without too many &#39;specialist&#39; parts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of using stickers - but this model has lots of them! Thankfully, not using them doesn&#39;t detract too much. (Although I did eventually relent&nbsp;and added the functions guide&nbsp;stickers on the flip-down panels!)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Despite the size of the model, it wasn&#39;t an overly complex build - needs a bit of attention at times, and an 11-year old may need a little guidance from time to time, but there isn&#39;t anything too difficult to deal with. I enjoyed the fact that you very quickly get stuck into the may gear-box area, which, unlike most models where it&#39;s built as a standalone module and bolted on, is built directly onto the chassis.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What you&#39;re left with is a very large model - much larger than I expected it to be. In fact, it&#39;s only a few cm shorter than the new Mobile Crane (mkII).</p>

<p>The functionality is great though - you have 2-axle steering, the cab flips down, the stabalisers extend (and lower, albeit manually) and of course that amazing crane on the back.</p>

<p>My criticisms are fairly minor, really - I&#39;d have liked to see the extending of the final boom and winch operation somehow connected elsewhere on the body, even if not connected to the PF&#39;s (sure, it&#39;d have been pretty complex - but sure it can be done!). I&#39;d have liked to see the stabalisers&nbsp;lowered differently than by hand - a minor thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also found that although packing an XL motor - mine really struggled with raising the upper arm - really&nbsp;protested about it. Perhaps I&#39;d made an error in the build, as the lower arm raised without too much of an issue though.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a stand-out set - and worthy contender of Best Technics Set, were there such a title! The truck itself and chassis are nothing special on their own, other than the size of them - but that crane is a work of art. Well worth the 5 year wait to build it, and actually preferred it to the new Mobile Crane. Don&#39;t have it yet? Get it! 5 stars from me.</p>

<p>The biggest issue for me was the relative poor performance of the crane mechanism as per the original instructions. &nbsp;Even with very careful attention to spacing, the bevel gears tend to slip or &quot;jump&quot; and the clutches do not work optimally. &nbsp;Fortunately there is an excellent solution for all the technical issues, and even some cosmetic improvements, from Han at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.designer-han.nl/lego/index.htm"">http://www.designer-han.nl/lego/index.htm</a></p>

The locking system on <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8043-1"">8043</a> is far more clever and handy.</div><div><br></div><div>- For the price of it, a dummy steering wheel in the cab is a real shame.

The front loader part and the outriggers of the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8862-1"">8862</a> Backhoe Grader were nowhere near this big a deal, and yet, some manual functions on it were more elegantly designed.</div><div><br></div><div>- Finally, if it was feasible on the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8052-1"">8052</a> container truck, why don't the cab doors open on this one?</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, I'm being overly critical. Never mind: you'd better grab a box of this set as soon as you can. Even if you don't want to build it (which I could hardly understand), then just consider it as an investment.

Until the build of this masterpiece&nbsp;I considered&nbsp;that PF Excavator to be the reigning champion but it has now, in a match decided on the cards rather than by K.O., lost it's title.

There are some parts which have existed for decades used in-pardon my redundancy- ingenius fashion. There's a part made of rubber (WOW!). There&nbsp; are the panels, beams, and pins which together form an EXTREMELY realistic appearing cabin which tips forward exposing a huge&nbsp;V8 powerplant.&nbsp; The design and function of the stabilizers is magnificent and though many have commented on it, no review can quite capture the engineering beauty of the gearbox.&nbsp; It boggles the mind that one (XL) motor can be harnessed to power the articulation of the crane, it's revolution, AND the extenstion and retraction of the stabilizers.&nbsp; This is the...wait for it...genius of the 8258's gearbox.</p><p>In&nbsp;terms of sheer size the 8258 is also&nbsp;amazing.&nbsp; This set is gigantic!&nbsp;Your&nbsp;friends- those who kinda shake their heads that you spend so much money on ""toys""- those friends will be impressed.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;always&nbsp;hired the&nbsp;(no longer&nbsp;commercially available) LEGO Technic&nbsp;action figures to ""operate"" my&nbsp;Technic models and heretofore those models&nbsp;have all been&nbsp;relatively within scale of those figures.&nbsp; While the Super Cars have run a little large most of the construction themed sets- which are the bread and butter of the Technic line-&nbsp;are the perfect size for these guys.&nbsp; This set, though, is a little large for them (the&nbsp;tires are nearly&nbsp;shoulder height) and though they sit comfortably in the&nbsp;cabin the overall truck is HUGE comparatively.&nbsp; So, in scale, it would be- slightly- larger&nbsp;than a standard OTR tractor.&nbsp;&nbsp;It absolutely dwarfs 8052 (PF Container Truck).&nbsp; On a shelf in one's office (or den, or library, or wherever one's significant other allows LEGO to be displayed) this set demands and receives attention.</p><p>As of the writing of this review, this set has (as most of the large Technic/PF sets) become very expensive in the secondary market.

I find the small details on this truck very impressive, things like a V8 engine instead of a V6, the radiator fan, the 5th Wheel on the back. The lifting cabin really adds another nice feature too.</p>
