"GarethMoore","2009-07-27T15:54:40.827Z","Nice design mechanically and great fun to build - plus some excellent free parts!","This is one of the best Technic sets I've built for a while.  It's pretty much the extreme opposite of 8264 (Hauler) - only one away by part number but a world away in terms of design.  Whereas 8264 has only 2 gears in the entire set, this goes to the opposite extreme and almost has more gearing than it really needs - which is fine by me!

The front section is articulated, with not one, not two but three universal joints passing drive through to the main section - one for the excellent 4-wheel drive split differential system which turns the 6 cylinder motor, and another two for raising and rotating the front bucket.

There's the usual hand of god steering system, which only really works whilst you're moving the model because it just uses a long beam to pull or push the front to either side - whilst seen on several recent Technic models it's still a nice change from a rack and pinion approach, at least in terms of building.

There's a gear to switch the rear-mounted finger gear drive between the two front bucket functions, although if you turn it by hand rather than following the optional motorisation instructions it takes an incredibly large number of wheel turns to raise the bucket all the way up/down!

Build quality is good, apart from a couple of external pieces (such as the ladder) which fall off very easily.

Overall it's great fun to make (which is what I want in a model, so it's definitely one of the best ones and well deserving of 5 stars), but you probably won't play with it much unless you add the motor - it's just too much effort! :)

Finally, my kit (direct from Lego's US website) had 9 extra of the new 5-hole T-beams, all loose in the box - the plastic bags in the box contained 8 grey T-beams, whereas the model used 8 darker grey T-beams.  Obviously someone at Lego made a mistake when they made the parts list, so clearly someone after the part bagging was complete had to go through adding 8 (or 9 in my case) of the correct colour parts to the box, just thrown in loose!  So some extra value there too!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"the27thMONKEY","2009-07-28T16:22:17.843Z","Great set but needs a motor.","I've just finished putting this one together. It's an excellent set I won't go in to much detail as another reviewer has covered the main points.

I will add that this set should have included motor in the box even if it added to the cost. Luckily I was able to use parts from the Off Roader 8297 to add the motor using the extra instructions. Everything fits inside nicely and makes the bucket a lot easier to use.

If you get this model I reccomend adding the motor to do it justice.

"iipsa","2009-11-02T07:51:58.547Z","8265","2 days ago, I got 8265 as a present. First thing you can see is that box is very very big. when I've opened the box I was pleasently surprised - huge number of special technic parts. 
Pro:
 - huge number of parts
 - huge number of gears
 - big bagger bucket
 - 2 new differentials
 - a lot of yellow beams

Cons:
 - acutator for bucket tilting is not operating smooth enough
 - steering should be made of gears
 - wheelbase is disproportined in comparison to wheels or 94,8 x 44R baloon wheels should be better

All in all very good set with lots of parts for reasonable amount of money (found out that set was for 55euros). 
I recomend this set.

"DrZeldenrustig","2009-09-29T18:33:04.233Z","Not my kind of model, yet awsome","Whilst being a great fan of Lego Technic in general, i'm not a fan of building-machines like buldozers, frontloaders, excavators and so on.
But i definately had to buy this model because i could get it for only €39. 

With over 1,000 pieces this model is massive and impressive.  The build itself , though not that hard with 3 books of buildinginstructions and very easy steps, is exciting because it shows us the various techniques that makes this model a absolute classic in the making. 

The steering with the folding chassis is so much fun. The 3 linear actuators geared in two step gearmotion, gives you very acurate movement of the scoop. With lots of greebles and other details this model looks almost like the real thing. 
 
The two minor cons; not being motorized and the oh so obvious yellow colouring, can not prevent this model for getting a almost perfect 4,95 out of 5.

Get it if you can.

"aldredd","2009-08-05T07:18:14.997Z","One of my new favourites","I picked this set up online for about £65. If you think that sounds like a bargain - you're not mistaken.

This is a fantastic set. If you into moving parts, complicated gearing systems etc - this set it for you - it's everything a technics set should be.

Whilst not 'difficult' to build, it's certainly more challenging than some of the other sets out there, such as the hauler.

The set has gears-galore - around 80 I think I counted.
It's a four-wheeled drive model, with both from & rear differentials connected through one of the three u-joints between the front and rear.

The steering is a little different from the usual turntable approach - it instead uses an arm between the two ends which 'pushes' the front in either direction. It's nice to see a different approach taken, but it's not wholly effective when the model isn't moving much - rather like the telescopic handler - but it matters not.

Another (very minor) niggle is ensuring the two differentials used to lift the arm are aligned correctly. It's difficult to connect them whilst retracted, but if they are not extended exactly the same amount, the bucket ends up skewed!

I would also say that if you want to play with this model, the motor set is a must have, else it takes forever to operate. I had a spare power functions set, and it make all the difference.

All in all, this is a fab set, which is both fun and interesting to build, and is an absolute must if you are looking to buy a set any time soon - I favour this set to become a 'classic'.

Just one more note - I've read several reviews on this set which mention about the extra T beams added in loosely. For me, this was not the case, so must have just been the first batch or so.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jf","2009-10-24T17:36:23Z","Great value for money","This is a huge set, especially for the price asked for it

It took some 3-4 hours to build and I had great fun putting it together. Having gotten used to sometimes disappointingly small models coming out of big boxes, this one surprised me in a very pleasant way. When the motor attached to the rear side of the chassis, the size of the model began to dawn on me. I have paid the same amount of money for way smaller models...

The model works great, it's even fun to play with. A lot of nice details too, such as the engine with moving pistons. I do however agree with the other comments about it definately requireing the power-set to make it work as it should. As with other non-motorized sets getting some movement takes a lot of turns on the small wheel on the back. Then again, not including the power-set in the box has a positive effect on the price.

All in all: one great set worth every penny you spend on it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"version3point1","2010-09-17T18:11:48.903Z","Bigger than expected!","<p>I bought the Technic Wheel Loader (8271) a few years ago, which was a nice way to start with Technic and a few of the parts, so when I saw this I thought it was an evolved version of the Wheel Loader that I'd previously bought.&nbsp;I didn't realise that the set, when put together, would be as big as it turned out to be!</p>
<p>The box should've been a bit of a giveaway (as with the '49cm' printed on the box), but you don't actually realise how large it is until you put it together.&nbsp;The amount you pay is surprising considering the huge amount of pieces you actually get. It took me a good few hours to get through the set.</p>
<p><b>PROS</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Great value for money</li>
    <li>A very sturdy model when finished</li>
    <li>Duration of construction lasts a good few hours and is very intensive, so you can spend the whole day doing it or make a project of it for a few days</li>
    <li>The mechanics of the set are very well thought out and are nice to put together as well as look at &ndash; also very good for a younger builder who may be into mechanical workings as it demonstrates the simple physics and engineering of it</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CONS</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some pieces were quite a tight fit and difficult to put together, resulting in a few cuts and sore fingers and thumbs</li>
    <li>The instructions weren't always clear</li>
    <li>The gears used mean the actions require a lot of effort &ndash; unless you've got the Power Functions set-up, it requires a lot of work to get the bucket up or down</li>
    <li>Because of the latter point, the actions aren't as smooth/fluid as they could be</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gearing system and mechanisms were very nice to put together, though the instructions weren't as clear as they could've been, resulting in a few mistakes and having to go back once or twice. Once you are about halfway through the build, the gears are exposed and quite interesting to look at &ndash; throughout the build there are various opportunities for you to marvel at the way things work by twisting or moving various bits.</p>
<p>There were a lot of pieces that were quite difficult to put together, not because the instructions were difficult to understand, but because they were quite tight with little in the way of movement when you needed to move a piece or two to centre alignment or to make space for more pieces.</p>
<p>The engine housing is quite nice, especially being able to lift up the bonnet and being able to expose it. The Power Functions integration is quite good, whereby it's easy to remove certain components to add the Power Functions kit. However, it would've been nice if they'd somehow thought about making the bonnet out of standard pieces as it would've been just as sturdy, rather than manufacturing a be-spoke piece.</p>
<p>All in all, a great functional set that is superb value for money. The finished product outweighs all the niggles overall, and it makes a great showpiece. <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/version-3-point-1/tags/8265/"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/version-3-point-1/tags/8265/</a></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,5

"Bram","2011-01-14T23:45:51.857Z","Building tips for building this great model!","<p>I bought this right after I was done building my 8043 Motorized Excavator . Since there were only few left at the local Lego store, I decided to grab it. They are no longer produced by Lego (or so, as someone said!) Since there are already a lot of previous reviews of this set, I'm going to give some tips on building this set which as everyone knows, comes with rather 'decieving' instructions therefore&nbsp;I found this model more challenging to build than the technically more complicated 8043!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you start building, have these few tools ready:</p>
<p>1. A measuring tools such as rulers or calipers. Most of the building processes of involve inserting axles into those grey axles and pin connectors. You often need to position the initial connectors in the middle (which is not mentioned in the booklet!). A ruler will help you aid to position the connector precilsely in the middle. This connector is usually 'sandwiched' by thin liftarms with axle holes. If you misaligned the axles off center, it's VERY hard to&nbsp;reposition the axles at later stages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. A small rubber mallet or hammer. This is sometimes handy to knock the axles in position should they be moved out of place during assembly. You need to carefully and lightly tap the axles and not the beam to avoid damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As some said, the instructions are not very clear. You need to REALLY pay attention of your actual model and constantly paying attention to the booklet and note if there are&nbsp;additional pins which must be inserted. And since most of builds&nbsp;are equal left to right, you need to rotate the model and see the opposing side (assembled side)&nbsp;as&nbsp;a reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building tips:</p>
<p>1. After step 74, p.44 booklet instruction 2, it's advisable to install the wheel and tires now. They provide a more stable base and looks better during assembly as you can observe the build process 'from the ground up'. Just make sure you have a flat table or it will roll down to the floor! LOL</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Soak the LAs with silicone oil and wipe all excess. This will make the LAs perform much smoother, lessening the load on&nbsp;the PF motor.</p>
<p>3. Dab of silicone oil on all the gears, driving rings for even smoother operation and function shifting.</p>

"SenatorBlutarsky","2011-02-14T13:35:55.83Z","Awesome!","<p>I picked up this model just recently through an e-tailer that had a storefront on Amazon.&nbsp; Considering that this set has been discontinued for a while and that it appears to be very popular, I was happy to be able to get it new for around $100.00.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike some of the other reviewers, I had very little trouble building this model.&nbsp; In fact, it went much smoother than I expected for a set with 1000+ pieces. &nbsp;I think I finished it in just over three hours.&nbsp; For whatever reason, I had more trouble with set 8063 (tractor with trailer) and even 8069 (backhoe-loader).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The functions included in this model are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Four-wheel drive.&nbsp; This means that there are front and rear differentials, but, because of the articulated geometry, no center differential. 
<li>A working V6 engine. 
<li>A rear hood that may be opened to get a better view of the engine. 
<li>Articulated steering via&nbsp;a gear-knob on the top of the cab. 
<li>Raising/lowering of the bucket via a combination of a gear-knob at the rear and lever located on the side of the cab. 
<li>Tilting of the bucket via the same gear-knob/lever combination.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in many of the larger Technic sets, a single gear-knob is used to provide the effort for more than one function.&nbsp; In this case, the tilting and raising/lowering of the bucket are controlled by the same gear-knob at the rear.&nbsp; The function is selected by a lever at the side of the cab that engages a dog clutch to link the rear gear-knob to either the tilting linear actuator (LA) or the pair of LAs that raise the bucket arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the articulated geometry, the steering works a little differently than in most models.&nbsp; Rather than a rack-and-pinion linkage, there is a long beam that connects the front section to the rear section on one side.&nbsp; The steering mechanism pushes this beam forward or backward to cause front section to bend to the left or right.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;works fairly well, but it is a little stiff -- I could definitely feel some torsion on the control axle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aesthetically, this model really shines.&nbsp; As others have noted, it is huge when it is finished.&nbsp; There is no other model, except perhaps the 8275&nbsp;bulldozer, that conveys as much of a sense of power as this loader does.&nbsp; I was also impressed by the attention to some of the finer details -- headlights, taillights, rear-view mirrors, rails around the cab and engine compartment, and the rear grill to name a few.&nbsp; In short, this model looks great, even though there were only 4 stickers that needed to be applied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since it takes quite a few turns of the control knob to raise or lower the bucket, I highly recommend that power functions be added to this set (as described in the instruction manual).&nbsp; With the power functions, the bucket operations proceed at a much more realistic rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts list for this model is impressive and should be a boon for MOCers.&nbsp; In addition to the 3 linear actuators, there are a huge number of gears (much more than I would have thought necessary to get the functions included in the model), two differential sets, and the parts for a V6 engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you exclude the flagship sets of 1300+ pieces (and the 8043 excavator), this loader may be the best Technic set of the past 4 or 5 years.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
