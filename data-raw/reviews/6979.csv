"Worker_Joe","2010-06-16T12:09:09.187Z","A decent set.","Set 6751-1 [Fiery Legend] is pretty detailed and looks great as the basic model on the box. It takes 20 to 30 minutes to finish the basic model, but it's worth it. Its wing peices can be used as sails for a pirate ship MOC too. I would recommend this set to friends and builders. This is great for a castle-theme lovers becuase you get an awesome dragon to fight the knights! The light brick works great and can be used in a LEGO House or city.",FALSE,5,5,4,4,4
