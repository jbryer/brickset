"darthdc","2009-09-03T11:28:56.903Z","Great detail for smallish set","A great set, this is with the usual 2 alternative builds.

The main build is the great looking run of the mill fire engine (fire tender in the US). As with all main builds, it has all the better features and detail. 
4 opening doors and a rotating telescopic ladder with water gun at the top.

Next is the Fire Jeep - the smallest of the 3 builds (loads of bricks left over). Apart from looking quite good, the only ""feature"" is an opening bonnet with a crude engine.

Last is the Fire Copter. This isn't too bad - the tail propeller is a bit bulky.

Pros

Plenty of bricks, takes around 3 hours to build the main model
Plenty of details: torch and extinguisher used on all 3 models
No stickers

Cons

The box is way too big
Could have had a proper hosepipe stored in the back rather than false compartment doors.
Roof of Fire engine is completely loose
Bit pricey at £40

"Capitán_Skrall","2011-06-02T16:33:27.19Z","Great builds","Well, looking for red pieces we got this one. :D<div><br></div><div>With 771 pieces its a relatively big model from the Creator line, and of course a useful piece assortment. It contains 12 bricks with headlight, lots of regular plates in red, an old style turntable, overall a nice inventory. Doesn´t come with stickers, it does have some printed tiles.</div><div><br></div><div>The main build is sturdy, with some snot on the sides. Also has chairs in the&nbsp;inside. Some nice detailing, and also a bunch of moving things. The four doors can be opened, the crane thing can spin, and also its retractable. The roof its not attached so you can remove it and check the interior. Really vroooomable!.</div><div><br></div><div>The other builds are really enjoyable, specially the helicopter. Just because the jeep its rather small. All of them with ingenious parts usages. Really dig the use of the actuators at the back of the jeep.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div>-Great building experience.</div><div>-Nice designs, all of them really detailed and sturdy.</div><div>-Useful pieces.</div><div>-Really good value for money.</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div>-Not very playable, more for sitting on a shelf, or just use it for pieces.</div><div>-Lack of steering, but you can make one yourself. ;)</div><div><br></div><div>I really recommend this set to anyone, its a fine model. Just like any Creator vehicle, it has an amazing level of detail and a great value. So I guess it deserves a 4.5/5 from me.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
