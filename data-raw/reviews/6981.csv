The ration price / parts is excellent and the littles cars are very nice better than the other 2 cars Creator, the green and yellow for the same size.

Have bought many kits over the last 3 years... mostly Technic (my old favorite) and Creator.  This set, the boat Creator set and the convertible Creator set have been the most enjoyable kits... even better than the large Technic tow truck!  I had a pile of fun building it over three sit downs, my son loved building the car portions, and the play factor for him was the best yet.  Can't wait to try the B & C designs, which both look like A designs only a few short years ago!  Lego, keep bringing on the new Creator kits... ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It's got everything you want from a Lego set; good looking models, great to play, good selection of parts. Is it perfect? No, nothing ever is, is it?

The main model is the car transporter truck. It's a brilliant model; it has steering, the trailer can be parked, the upper deck folds down for loading and the doors on the truck open. I love the details like the coffee machine in the cab and the horns and lights on the roof. The windscreen isn't the prettiest I've seen but doesn't detract from the overall impression of the truck.
Two complaints here: 
the legs to park the trailer are hidden underneath. A lever on the outside would have been good. 
The rear wheels on the truck are on fixed axles making it hard to make tight turns. Two #5 axles instead of a single #10 would have fixed this.

The second model is the recovery truck. While in some details you can see it's a secondary model it's still a good looking truck. All the play functions are at the back. I was disappointed that this model has no steering.

The third model is an impressive 5-axle mobile crane. I haven't built it yet so I can't say too much about it.

Overall a great set that will keep children playing and building for a long time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"edpylant","2009-10-24T11:56:16.433Z","18 total wheels in the set = lots of fun","My 4 year old and I have had lots of fun playing with this set. He loves anything with wheels so we have enjoyed many hours of imagine play of picking up the 2 cars in the set and dropping them off.

Of the sets we have this is probably our favorite. 

It is a larger scale than the mini-figure scale, but the mini-figures still have made their way behind the driver seat of the transporter anyway. :)

There are a couple of pieces that occasionally fall off, but overall this set is very sturdy and has held up to a four year old playing with it.

Raising and lowering the top level of the transporter is easy to do and we have had no issues with moving it up and down when loading or unloading the cars.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"gokerg","2010-04-26T16:43:13.903Z","Nice","I have bought this set when I was in Germany 10 days ago for an exhibition trip. <br><br>It is just like my most favorite set 6335 Indy transport. it is just a little bit bigger. I still could not find the time to build it but it is obvious that the set is good. Since I'm collecting road vehicles, this will be one of the best items of my sets. I'll also get the 6743 to add another car to the truck. I really think this set is worth the money you will pay for it.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
"Steamrunner","2010-12-31T06:54:51.637Z","Very impressive set that actually feels like money well spent","<p>I'm a recent returnee to Lego - at 37 not exactly the target audience, but I was given a Mindstorms set for Christmas and it's kicked me off again.</p><p>I decided I needed a few more sets to give me extra parts to work with, and at Â£52 for nearly 1300 pieces (in the Argos sale) I thought this would be an ideal set to get. I also picked up the Technic Motorised Excavator and, due to the nature of Technic sets containing lots of tiny connector pieces, it looks kinda disappointing when you open the whopping big box and see just a few bags in there - but not with this set! I lost count of how many bags of pieces are in the 6753 box, and I soon ended up with a large pile on the table. It's also nice to see that the instructions for all 3 models are in the box, unlike the Technic and Mindstorm sets where you have to download the B model instructions.</p><p>I'm also very impressed with the level of detail in all 3 models - things have certainly moved on from when I last had Lego. The main model has windscreen wipers and adjustable mirrors, the recovery truck has fuel tanks made out of unused wheels, and the crane also has some very nice design detail. Although the kit will ultimately be used for parts in other models, I will be building all three designs first to familiarise myself with the parts and to get inspiration.</p><p>All in all, I'm very impressed with this set (and not just because of the lower prices it's on sale for at the moment) and would definitely recommend it.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"av8r1973","2011-01-04T09:49:27.827Z","Perfect kit - lots of playability!","<p>This is the single set responsible for my re-entry into LEGO after a 30-year hiatus.&nbsp; I was browsing the kits with my 3 and 5yo daughters, and this one caught all of our eyes.&nbsp; The colors really popped.&nbsp; Bright yellow truck, blue and white sports cars and great looking alternate models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We got it home and immediately built the two cars.&nbsp; One for each daughter.&nbsp; After bedtime, I built the truck.&nbsp; LOTS and LOTS of parts.&nbsp; Nice use of Technic beams in the trailer really simulate the real thing.&nbsp; The functioning tailgate and ramp to the upper-deck are aweome, too!&nbsp; The cars stay nicely in place on the upper-deck via the little ramps, and the lower deck easily houses one, as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truck steers&nbsp; easily via the technic gear on top and is a lot of fun to drive around our living room making deliveries.&nbsp; I actually still play with this one every other week or so, just for fun.&nbsp; The cab is great with a coffee machine, reclining seats and adjustable headrests.&nbsp; Nice coloring, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The B and C models are equally impressive, but obviously not the primary model.&nbsp; No steering on the wrecker?&nbsp; Makes it difficult to get around the house.&nbsp; The crane is nice, too, but again - no steering.&nbsp; It's still a great use of existing parts and I am amazed they can do so much with the available parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I highly recommend this kit for the amazing playability, sheer size of it and the impressive looks!&nbsp; It's on a shelf next to my Technic Excavator and Crane Truck and looks right at home.&nbsp; Very cool.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"stevanooz","2011-05-31T03:10:00.757Z","Big Vehicle for Big Fans of LEGO","<p>For me, personally, this is the best set from Creator Themes. It has a lot of bricks and the detail of every model is very nice. The detail for every model is different and maybe not necessary, but at least it add the touch for every model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From this set, you can create 3 different model of the truck. Really, really different. First model is Highway transport, the second model is Tow truck and the third model is Crane mobile. And 3 of them really use almost of the brick available. So, you can find your truck big or bulky or heavy...</p>
<p>Even the color is all yellow, but its ok. It will be nice if this set add some other color than mostly yellow.</p>
<p>You really will have fun building for every model. You won't regret wasting your time building for every model. For myself, it took a lot of ""courage"" to part off the model just to build another model.. :). Because is so good to look at it. Maybe I should bought 3 set.. :)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't said the same for the cars. For the first model it has 2 cars and 1 car for second model. The car is, well, so-so. The door can't be opened, the detail is only for exterior only. In the second model, the position for the wheel of the car even not precise with the driver seat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this model focus on the yelow big truck there and the cars is only for the sake of completeness and detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you like to build a big set and complex set from creator, you will not miss this one. You will get a lot of&nbsp;bricks and you can't stop until you finish build it. You won't regret it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"verna2000","2012-04-18T10:59:45.047Z","Good price/parts ratio","<p>I knew that this set is big based in the description listed in this site, but never expected something this big!</p>
<p>I mean this is not as big or complicated to build as its technic counterparts, but you will get surprised once you see the finished product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Big amount of pieces 
<li>Good size to get details 
<li>Color scheme&nbsp;is fine despite we are getting more and more yellow in all sets 
<li>Cars have fairly good amount of details 
<li></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Building is a little repetitive 
<li>Need a third car to really take advantage of the transport 
<li>Would be nice to have steering in the rig</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>As a conclusion what I can say is that this set has a very special place in my collection. If you are fan of the creator sets you will have a treasure in your hands!</li></ul>
