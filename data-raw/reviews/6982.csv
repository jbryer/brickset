"agent_chase","2009-07-06T19:02:23.03Z","Surprisingly simple, but awesome","I went to the King of Prussia lego store on wednesday and I bought cafe corner, 
while there I saw that the Family Home was available. They said I could buy it  with Shop and Ship. I got it on monday the 6th. Today. I just finished an hour ago and thought I should review it here.

The Exterior

     The strongest point of the exterior was the duck pond. It is just so simple, yet captivating . The picnic table is only made from 13 pieces. The patio and walkway were boring to build but again is realistic. The doorway is cool as is the lamp. I am just surprised how simple it all was.

The Interior

The Interior was slightly disapointing with no furniture except for the stairs, arch and fireplace, but that leaves room for additional items. There are two white and  trans-orange wall lights next to the sliding door on the inside. There isn't much else inside.

The Build

The build varied in difficulty, but nothing incredibly hard There were a lot of jumper plates for the windows. There was mostly a lot of repition ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"HQuiff","2009-08-24T08:20:03.967Z","A Classic Of It's Time","Intro -
Well to start, I got this from my two older Brothers on my Birthday this year. And really, I have to say what a phenomenon this set is. The design, architecture, and idea is extraordinary magnificent. Every tiny detail down to the simple shutters and sliding door mechanism is great.
Any, as usual I'll break it down into smaller parts.

Build - 10/10. I built this with my eldest brother, him and I doing different pages. The build it's self is fun, yet interesting and shows some interesting styles and techniques. The bottom floor was probably the highlight of doing it, as the fireplace and huge gaping front window both offer some great pieces and new ideas. However, as much as it was great building things for the bottom floor in the interior, the exterior was more exciting, though just as challenging, with cooled stones and patios, to a nice duck-pond. Everything here is just wonderful.

Minifigs - N/A. As it is a Town House and it comes from Creator, there are absolutely no Minifigs included, however if you're like me, that won't matter as you already have enough to burst the house with.

Structure - 9/10. The structure is something else. Tall, yet you're still able to get both hands inside, stable, yet not unbreakable, and light, yet not able to topple over. The whole thing is great, but not perfect, which in my case is great. If it's able to withstand a shifty knock from the elbow, then I'll tick that as a yes.

Color scheme - 9/10. It pretty much uses every color in the book. From a red slanted roof, to a dark and light gray patio, you have almost every color in the world! I've even made a list of them!

1. Gray
2. Dark Gray
3. Red
4. Blue
5. Green
6. Light blue
7. Brown
8. Yellow
9. White
10. Light green
11. Tan :] 
12. Dark Tan

And probably a few more I forgot to mention.
In any case, as you can see it uses everything, however it works. Nothing is to dominant, apart from the tan, however that it's self doesn't take over TO much.

Interior - 8/10. It's empty... to the much part that is. It does actually have a fireplace and a few candles inside, so it's no completely empty. Plus you have a nice staircase, and some nice beams on the top floor.

Exterior - 10/10. It's perfect! Absolutely perfect! From every angle, it looks elegant, and brilliant. Along with the canopy, patios, bench, solar light, plant pots, birdbath, and plants on the windowsill, you also have the elegance of the building. It's just so wonderfully done... I can't even describe how fitting the whole thing is. A truly wonderful gift.

Overall - 10/10. Definitely making it into my top 3 Favourite sets, I highly recommend this to any fan, who likes LEGO. Great for every age and size.

That's about everything. Hope you enjoyed my review!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legomaniac","2009-08-30T23:54:31.28Z","I want to build a real life house just like this","This is a fantastic house, The best LEGO made as I think. not much of an interior but I made my own with a nice bedroom upstairs with a pc, and large TV downstairs with a sofa. I never had the Gold piece before, and the sliding door. Very big inside.

"sudorum","2009-12-28T18:49:51.717Z","a Modular Masterpiece","Lotta' goods in this here set. Nothin' like this here set. Now THIS is a set. Unlike the older creator houses, this house actually has a detachable roof. The color scheme works well, along with the outside patio and duck pond. The roof separates by being pulled apart in half. The use of window placement is strategic, and building structure is sturdy. Not every set is perfect though. I wish this house were equipped with accessories in the inside, so i wouldn't have to go digging for some in my giant lego box. And it would be nice to have enough pieces to build all three houses instead of one. All in all a good set, bigger than i expected, too.",FALSE,5,5,4,4,5
"blocktron","2010-01-03T12:24:13.607Z","So Good I'll buy it twice!","This is my second Creator House purchase having bought and made set 4956. Of the 2 this one is by far my favourite for a number of reasons. In terms of the actual set it comes with a variety of novel features, including sliding patio doors (it's actually a window mounted like the doors on the old cargo train box car) patio and pond, and a very nice fireplace inside (about the only internal feature, everything else is empty awaiting your own creative touches) The best way of showing how impressed with this set I am would be the fact that I'm about to buy 2 more.

Plus Points:
Removable roof (in 2 parts) revealing attic space and ground floor.
The gutters and drain come complete with drains (a nice touch)
Sliding doors
Fireplace

Minus:
(These are pedantic but for completeness!)
Flowers - I can't buy into the multi-coloured cones for foliage.
Split roof - Also a plus point but the join can look a little bit off.
Windows - only has windows on 2 sides, other 2 sides are block only.

For those wanting to add something to this model I would suggest:
Run a micro LED into the porch light
Build a bbq on the patio area
Replace the flowers with the actual lego flowers
Interior details like sofa, toilet, kitchen sink (there is a drain outside that appears to come from the area that should be the kitchen)
Combine the fireplace provided with the one from this years Advent Calendar.

I'll be honest I bought this house more for parts than the actual model, and I'm not at all disappointed, the brick colour is much more suitable for larger models than the gloss white of 4956 and provides you with enough bricks to really branch out and explore your creative side.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

 Het is echt veel bouw pezier voor jong en oud. vooral de combie van kleuren en de humor van de eend op het dak.
ook de ramen en de schuifdeur is wel leuk. en de ramen net de luikjes is ook mooi. 
 Echt een top set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"wakwak","2010-03-15T10:05:27.75Z","Home sweet home","This is the third creator house I built after 4996 and 4954 and it should remain one of my favorite so far.<br><br>The house itself is nicely designed and the 2 parts roof is a neat feature. While the basefloor build is kind of straightforward and boring, the 1st floor and roof section is pretty enjoyable.<br>Some additional elements are trully enjoyable (garden table,...) and the sliding door is really terrific.<br><br>The set contain a impressive quantity of tan bricks and is a bargain for the price.<br><br>I highly recommend this set.

"birgoyle","2010-04-21T10:12:49.873Z","Great set for many reasons!","This is one of the best Creator houses so far - I managed to pick up 3 at K-Mart at the severely reduced price of $45 (Australian) each!<br><br>The house itself is an excellent addition to any city, and blends perfectly with 4996 Beach House and 5891 Apple Tree House. Using these 3 sets alone I've made a nice suburban street. (housing is something lacking from the current City line)<br><br>Don't know about the ""playability"" factor - with no furniture inside, but this is easily fixed with minimal pieces from your own collection. <br><br>The best thing about this set is the amount of pieces - there are endless possibilities for other sets using just the pieces in this set. <br>I've managed to make a Hotel, a medieval cottage (similar design to 10193 Medieval Market Village), and also use the excess pieces to add to sections of Hogwarts from Harry Potter, as well as donating some to a friend for an Egyptian tomb. <br><br>I don't think I've ever seen this amount of Tan pieces in one box before - including the Harry Potter sets (for some reason they all have the ground floor in dark/light grey... frustrating)<br><br>I know they've long been discontinued, but if you ever see one of these sets in a bargain bin or on sale, then buy it, the set and building possibilities are more than worth the price tag!<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
"SilentAlarm","2010-06-04T19:22:15.997Z","The Best of the Creator Houses","I bought this set from my local target for 60 dollars and am satisfied with the end result.<br>Clocking in at 956 pieces it certainly has lot's of bang for it's buck.<br><br><h4>The Build</h4>The build for the main model uses two instruction booklets, and took me roughly one and a half hours to complete this set. It was a fairly simple build using almost no interesting techniques.

"skypirate","2010-08-30T23:24:52.23Z","Great house in need of a family","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">This review is based on the primary build.</span><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall rating:</span><br>The 6754 Family House's McMansion styled architecture makes a nice addition to the LEGO collection. One of the better LEGO homes for providing a usable, playable and accessible interior living space. The second floor is sizable and removable in two halves (front and back).<br><br>There is some spacial slight of hand. More living space than most LEGO house sets, but at the expense of not having a garage. I could easily see buying a second set, doing a mirror image build, construct a garage where the front window is, move that window to the back and combining the two to make a large McMansion with a garage.<br><br>The tan/brick yellow theme is a welcome relief from white brick houses, I'd still prefer medium or light brick color.<br><br>Overall, the Family House is wonderful. beautiful on the outside and a less clutter and better interior than most sets.<br><br>I really regret missing out on purchasing the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=4954-1"">4954 Model Town House</a> when it was in stock at an affordable price. Yet, I found myself a little reluctant to take the plunge on the 6754 Family Home. With a little soul searching I came to the conclusion that I was wanting the Family Home to fulfill my Model Town House expectations.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Building experience:</span><br>The 6754 Family House is appropriately packaged in a rather large box and include four sets of instructions. Two are for the primary build and the other two for the alternate builds.<br><br>With nearly a thousand pieces, it would have been nice if the bricks had been packaged for a sequential build of the primary house. Hunting for the right brick proved unnecessarily time consuming and mildly annoying.<br><br>Having already built the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=4956-1"">4956 House</a>, two <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=4996-1"">4996 Beach Houses</a>, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=5891-1"">5891 Apple Tree</a> and the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8403-1"">8403 City House</a>, the Family Home was a familiar build. The unique build technique for this set was the slightly inset windows and the porch lamp. The arched window with the art deco glass blocks above the doorway is a nice touch.<br><br>The back half of the roof isn't very strong structurally. It nearly collapsed when I tried to pack down the bricks.<br><br>I find the alternate builds unappealing.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Parts:</span><br>Sliding doors. Blue and white curved slope pieces. A nice collection of tile pieces. Gold bird bath piece. Great pieces for building houses. Probably not as good for more exotic creations.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Playability:</span><br>Outstanding design for playability. The Family House is just waiting for a family to move in. With the exception of the picnic table and mug, the house is unfurnished and vacant. On the plus side, this means you can complete it as you see fit. There's also the pet duck.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Value for money:</span><br>Pretty good value for the money. It's been a long time since purchasing a set with this many pieces. Four sets of instructions have to cost a bit for LEGO to include.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Areas for improvement:</span><br>Now that I own five unfurnished LEGO homes, I'd like to see LEGO produce some interior sets. Kitchen, living room, study and bedrooms. I think there's a market for it.<br><br>I <span style=""font-style: italic;"">really do</span> like this set, but it is a bit of a ""fixer upper."" I don't count off for these things, because the sets are often compromises to make a model with alternate designs. Plus, we generally have the option of fixing them.<br><br>The red roof, blue shutters and yellow door (primary colors) are a little cartoonish for my tastes.<br><br>This is the first house set I've bought that didn't have a mailbox and token tree. I'd love to see a shade tree behind the duck pond.<span id=""Label7""> I definitely want to upgrade the duck pond's plant life with Bamboo leaves 30176</span> or Leave 3 Elements <span id=""Label7"">6255</span> pieces and the flowers to the <span id=""Label7"">3741 </span>stalk variety.<br><br>The diagonal sidewalk heads for the duck pond, doesn't reach the street. Not sure you would build a sidewalk to the duck pond, but not the street. But is easily fixable with just a straight path to the street.<br><br>The first floor <a href=""http://www.skypirate.net/lego/images/IMG_7675.jpg"">interior arch has a zigzag</a> that looks like a mistake.<br><br>The picnic table at the front of the patio obscures the nice tile pattern and blocks traffic through the sliding doors. Moving the picnic table to the back of the patio would allow you to see more of the tile pattern and make the sliding doors more accessible.<br><br>
An interior wall on the second floor would make the roof stronger.<br><br>White flooring upstairs?<br><br>More of a chuckle, building a fireplace under the L shaped wooden staircase seems like really ill advised fire hazard. The resulting fire could leave family members on the second floor stranded, without an escape route. Fortunately, LEGO City has a renowned Fire Department just down the street. A stairwell that reverses directions 180 degrees with either an under stairs closet or toilet, seems like a better floor plan.",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

Recently I'd started up again with my first set being <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=3182-1"">3182 City Airport</a>.

It took me approx 2 and 1/2 hrs to build this set which surprised me.<br>I think the creator houses look amazing and I hope to collect them all for a nice suburban theme a few streets out of my city. They actually need to be placed away from the city as they dwarf all the actual city sets and the proportions do not match up.<br>I have since furnished the house and I have moved some mini-figs in.
