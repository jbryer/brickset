The 4 projects are good, and I made a nice snowmobile.

Pros:
Alpha rex 2.0 walks good 
Nice parts
Easy to use software

Cons:
Needs more gears!
A bit pricy

"Steamrunner","2010-12-31T08:20:38.763Z","Lego for grown-ups","<p>I received this as a Chrimbo present from my wife, as my usual hobby (building and racing r/c cars) has had to be put on ice for the time being as we have a baby. Since my wife is at home alone all day with the baby anyway while I'm at work, I felt it would be wrong to go out in the evenings too. Fortunately my wife remembered seeing me look at the v1 Mindstorms kit in a store over a year ago, and thought this might be a way to give me something to build and tinker with which I could do at home. And, as it turns out, she was right!</p><p>The v2 set has some differences from the v1 Mindstorms pack; the main difference is there's no sound sensor in the v2 (instead there's an extra touch sensor) and the colour sensor is different. There are also small differences in the number and type of Technic parts supplied. In terms of the kits themselves this doesn't really make a difference, as far as I can see; you can make some interesting stuff from both of them. Since the v1 kit has been around longer, there are plenty of resources (books and websites) already available for it, but not as much for the v2 kit - so although you can make most of the v1 models with the v2 kit, you can't make all of them without either getting extra parts, or improvising. Of course the real fun of Lego comes with making your own designs, so in reality it doesn't really matter. The lack of a sound sensor in the v2 kit doesn't bother me, in fact I'm much happier that there are two touch sensors.</p><p>Enough of the comparisons, though, and time to look at the kit itself. The first thing you notice is that there don't seem to be that many parts - this is mainly due to the fact that Technic sets require a lot of the tiny connector parts to join the various bits together. Out of the 619 pieces in the box, around a third of them are these connectors, so it does look a bit stingy on parts. However you can still build some pretty neat models with what you get, and I would be very surprised if any owners didn't also go and pick up at least one other Technic set to expand their parts collection. I know I did! Anyway, although there don't seem to be that many parts, I still found it worthwhile getting a multi-compartment storage box (around £10 from B&amp;Q or Clas Ohlson) to sort the bits into different pots to keep things organised during building. <br></p><p>The first model I built was, unsurprisingly, the one in the manual included in the box. It's a basic little robot that moves around on tracks; not very exciting, but gets you used to how the bits work and how the software works. Incidentally, if you're using the software on a Mac, you need to download the patch from the Mindstorms website BEFORE you try to install it on Snow Leopard! I also found it useful to either disable Bluetooth on my Mac, or turn off the NXT brick, whilst using the programming software - if the NXT brick was still visible to the software it slowed it down to a crawl. Speaking of the software, it's very easy to use - it's kinda like drawing a flow chart with Visio. Anyway, with the first model built and tested, I moved on to the others which are included as instructions within the Mindstorms app.</p><p>This is where we meet the main drawback, and from what I can see, it's something Lego seem to be guilty of elsewhere too - no explanations for what you're doing. You're given the usual step-by-step building instructions, and then the same approach is used for getting you to set up your software program. You're shown which blocks to drag onto the canvas, and how to set them up, but you're never told <span style=""font-style: italic;"">why</span> you're doing it. It's the same with the Technic Motorised Excavator - it's got a very complex set of gears and links and so on, but there's never any explanation of what each bit is going to do, or how it's going to work, or why it has to be designed like that. Kids (and indeed adults) learn so much more if they can understand why they've been told to do something or how things work. Fortunately there are websites and books which do a much better job at this than Lego do - simply search Amazon for Mindstorms books and you'll find them.</p><p>Anyway, that aside, the additional models offer different ideas of how to use the kit. The ball shooter is quite impressive - it should wind up a few cats, I imagine! The robocroc isn't that great; the walking motion (a prime example of where some explanation would really help) is pretty poor but it's given me some ideas of things to do with my daughter when she's older. The ball sorting machine is pretty good - I need to study the mechanics of it a bit more before I disassemble it, but it's a great example of the sort of thing you can do beyond simple robots that move forwards until they sense a wall. In fact it was this robot that made my father-in-law realise that this kit wasn't just a toy - up until then he really couldn't understand why I was ""playing with Lego"" all Boxing Day! Once he saw the ball sorter work, and understood that it was actually detecting the colours and deliberately sorting them into different baskets, he was quite impressed.</p><p>I'm certainly looking forward to building the humanoid robot - the video I've seen of it looks pretty cool, and I'm very curious to see what the program for it looks like. It might be a while, though - getting this set has also triggered the purchase of a few other Lego kits (mainly so I've got more components to build with) so I've got quite a few other bits to look at too! I have already bought an additional NXT component - the Infrared sender, so I can use the Powerforce motors from the other kits I've bought with the NXT set. I'm not sure my wife realised what she was doing when she bought me the NXT, but at least I can say she's only got herself to blame... And hey, it's all good practice for when my daughter is old enough to start using it too! <br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"jeppetechnic","2011-02-20T04:45:28.99Z","Brilliant LEGO set – especially for AFOLs","<p>After a long dark age I found this set on sale, and I couldn’t resist the temptation to buy it. It is my first set in 25 years, and really awakened my childhood interest for LEGO.</p>
<p>The LEGO mindstorm NXT 2.0 comes with the NXT 2.0 brick, 3 mindstorm motors, 2 touch sensors, 1 color/light sensor and 1 movement (ultrasonic) sensor. In addition there are enough bricks to get you started with the four included projects. Finally the set of course also comes with a CD-ROM containing the Mindstorm Software. </p>
<p>The ability to program the NXT brick is so brilliantly, and adds a dimension to building LEGO that I never though possible. </p>
<p>The four included projects take you nicely step-by-step through the building and programming process. They include </p>
<ul>
<li>A small robot driven by belts and with the ability to detect “enemies” and shoot balls at them if they don’t move away 
<li>An alligator that will attack anyone intruding it’s territory 
<li>A sorting machine, that will sort balls by their colour 
<li>A humanoid robot that can walk and ask for a ball of a specific colour.</li></ul>
<p>The four different builds are very interesting, and especially the alligator is popular with my children. All together the sets really make a nice use of the included bricks and show a magnificent variety of builds. In this way I think I spend something like 15 hours just playing around with the included instructions. When you are finished with this the official website can supply even more instructions from the fan community, so if you don’t want to do MOCs, there will still be plenty of opportunities for you.</p>
<p>The programming of the NXT-brick is done by the visual software, where you connect different programming blocks and in this way very visually build up your program. However being a computer programmer myself, I really consider moving on to one of the real programming languages available, since I personally find it easier to write code instead of “drawing” code. But I believe that it is a excellent way to introduce non-programmers to programming.</p>
<p>The cons of the set is that all building instructions are included as part of the Mindstorm software, and I think it could have been really nice to be able to build the sets without sitting in front of a computer. </p>
<p>Another problem is that I somehow felt a bit lost in the software, even though the included instructions were very clear, it was somehow difficult to move on and build your own. There is obviously so many possibilities in the programming that are not touched upon in the included sets, and the documentation is also quite limited. </p>
<p>Therefore I highly recommend supplementing this set with one of the excellent books out there, e.g. “The LEGO Mindstorms NXT 2.0 Discovery Book” by Laurens Valk, which really takes you through all the details of the programming, and learns you about all the features of the “programming language”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the cons, I will highly recommend this set it is without doubt the most innovative LEGO set ever produced. <br/></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"legodude6763","2011-03-20T13:56:44.093Z","The best set ever.","Best set ever! For the money it is really good also if you are looking for a programmable robot this would be it. It can also be programmed with c++ or other programs. You should definitely get this set. It could com with a lot more gears though.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
