"Challengestradale","2010-01-16T17:00:07Z","Great, but too many stickers","I got this set for Christmas and I have to say that I couldn't wait to open it and build it

The Minifigs:

I like how they have tried to replicate the real Ferrari suits. But the detailing is on stickers rather than printed on the torso, which is a shame

The Car:

It's the same that you get in 8168 which means you can have a spare car for races. Being based on the F2008 it bears the number 1 on it's nose meaning that it's meant fro Kimi rather than Felipe. Same as the minifigs it comes with alot of stickers. But it is still nice.

The Truck:

The new truck is shorter than the previous version and has to accomodate a slightly larger car, but everything fits nicely inside. Inside there are two parallel runners that the car is placed on and the wheels are put onto two technic pieces attached to the back of the cab which no longer detaches from the trailer.

Overall rating: 4/5

The reason it's a 4 because the use of too many stickers really lets the set down. Also it is very expensive (the old one was bigger and cheaper). But apart from these problems I still recommend this set to any Ferrari fan",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sharky","2011-06-30T11:00:43.007Z","Great Ferrari Truck","<p>I like to think of this set is an update to the Scuderia Ferrari Truck 8654. &nbsp;The box indicates that the set&nbsp;commemorates&nbsp;Ferrari's 2008&nbsp;Constructors&nbsp;Championship. &nbsp;I have the previous truck and wanted to get this one as the car is updated as well as the&nbsp;addition&nbsp;of the refueling tech.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>Box is rather large and it's&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;to note that the&nbsp;completed&nbsp;truck fits back in the box. &nbsp;I like the overall black color as it sets off the red truck and Ferrari logo. &nbsp;The instruction is one large book.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The mix of parts is varied. &nbsp;Obviously you get a lot of red pieces. &nbsp;There's only 3 of the large smooth panels whereas the 8654 has 6. &nbsp;Lots of smooth 1X? plate pieces. The silver/grey hubcaps are nice.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures are good. &nbsp;I feel you get enough minifigures to include ever character you will need to have fun playing. &nbsp;I wish that the driver was a specific person instead of a generic race car driver. &nbsp;A decorated driver helmet would have been nice. &nbsp;The addition of a refueling tech is the highlight of the minfigures with the gold visor and air tank.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was fun. &nbsp;Not too&nbsp;repetitive. &nbsp;I found making the 2 drawers interesting. &nbsp;Both the car and truck were good builds and not difficult for the younger builders. &nbsp;All the bags are numbered 1-6 so it made things real easy. &nbsp;First you&nbsp;build&nbsp;the minifigures, 2 tool boxes, a computer, and some misc. track pieces. &nbsp;Bag 2 is the car itself. &nbsp;Nice update to the 8654 and slightly longer too. &nbsp;Bags 3 and 4 are next which gets you halfway through the truck. Bags 5 and 6 finishes it off.</p><p><br></p><p>The only complaint are the stickers. &nbsp;Most were easy to put on, but the larger ones are a pain. &nbsp;For the large stickers with white striping on the side, I suggest building the door and installing it on the hinges in order to line up the white striping to the white bricks on the side of the cab. &nbsp;This will help make sure the white lines line up with each other. &nbsp;Also, be careful with the large horse stickers on the rear. &nbsp;Air bubbles will get trapped if you are not&nbsp;careful.</p><p><br></p><p>There are stickers to make the car either number 1 or number 2, so you can make the car either a Kimi Raikkonen or Felipe Massa. &nbsp;I made it 2 for Massa. &nbsp;Actually, if they included a spare 2x2 smooth plate you would be able to swap numbers anytime.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>Everything can be stowed either in the main cargo area or the 2 large sliding drawers underneath. &nbsp;I like the 2 tire racks to hold the tires when the car is in the truck. &nbsp;At first I thought the tires would simply slide off the rail pins. &nbsp;However, there are 2 bricks on the inside of each door that block the tires from coming off when the doors are closed. &nbsp;Very clever idea and I wasn't sure of the purpose of those bricks while building the doors. &nbsp;I like that the driver can keep his hat on while driving the truck. &nbsp;In set 8654 you had to remove the hat otherwise the roof wouldn't close completely. &nbsp;I feel the fact that the truck is one piece rather than a truck and trailer like 8654 is much nicer. &nbsp;Easier to display and play with. &nbsp;A lot of play value with the 2 tool boxes, tools, and race computer. &nbsp;I wish it included a fuel tank with hose and nozzle for the refueling tech.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Overall I think this is an excellent set for anyone that likes Lego and F1 racing and/or&nbsp;Ferrari. &nbsp;Even though the truck is smaller than the previous 8654 I think it's still quite nice and has a great deal of play value. &nbsp;I prefer the 1 piece truck rather than the 2 piece like the old one. &nbsp;Aesthetically it's nicer and more modern looking than the previous one.</div><div><br></div><div>The only 2 cons I see is the numerous stickers which was expected if you built the previous truck and the price point. &nbsp;A little high, but keeping in mind it's a licensed set it's not so bad.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-01T05:31:29.97Z","LEGO Racers (Ferrari) - Ferrari Truck Review","This set is full of play features and it's a lot of fun! The build of this set is great and it's very sturdy as well. We also get a lot of stickers we've to worry about. One thing I don't like about this set is that the minifigs all have a sticker on the front and on the back of their torso. But the details of this truck and of this Formula 1 care are amazing. We get two wagons with some tools in it, a screen and a part of a race track.<br><br>The F1 car has some really nice details. Even the sponsors look nice on this car. If you want to put the minifig inside the car you have to remove two pieces. The truck itself looks awsome as well. The bottom has two drawers with some stuff in it and the ceiling over the cockpit can be removed if you want to put the minifig in there. There're also two seats which allows you to put on two minifigs in there. The wall on the back and the walls on the sides can be opened if you want to put the F1 car into the truck. There's also a place inside where you can put the tyres of the race car. It's a really fun set to have and I also can't complain about the number of minifigs we get here.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
