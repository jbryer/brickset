"Nightshroud99","2009-05-28T10:29:17.233Z","Preety Good Set","This is a pretty good set; nice parts, two minifigures, and great playability for younger kids.

PROS:
Dark Brown Hairpiece: The hairpiece isn't light brown its dark, I've never seen lego hair this color.
Two Minifigures: You get the guy from the granite grinder and the guy from boulder blaster/ crystal sweeper (metal plate on his head)
Nice pieces: Especially the piece that hold the jackhamemr on the miners body; it has alot of mod potential.
Crystal King is very fun to play with

CONS:
Crystal King could be a little taller, but this is easily fixed.
Needs some crystals on the kings legs

Overall this is a very cool set imo. The Crystal Kings name is also Rockrage if you wanted to know. Anyway check out my lego reviews on youtube! http://www.youtube.com/user/Nightshroud99",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mr_brightside711","2009-06-30T23:41:28.217Z","Can you smell, what the Rock, is cooking?!","I just ordered this set at legoshop and it took 12 days to get here to japan. including the weekend. This is a good one though+.

Very short and simple build but they kept me interested.

The minifingers are very cool and the first P.M. set under $30.00 with more then one minifigure! yahhh!

Pros:
good price
2 minifigures
Miner drill
4 lime green crystals
Dynamite stick
Posable
He can hold both miners
New peices
Spikes
Head Piece
Mouth opens
No stickers!
Only one Con

Best Feature:
The crystal king has a huge mouth for eating those crystals...
or miners! :]

Cons:
small-ish legs

This is a must have for the collection of Power Miners sets. Plus you will have a rock monster big enough to deal with some of the bigger sets like the crystal sweeper and rock wrecker. or least thats what he deals with for me! but seriously! IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS BIG GUY, YOU CAN'T CALL YOURSELF A POWER MINERS FAN!

"ancient_collector","2009-09-20T18:03:43.06Z","Amazing","I rarely write set reviews, but this set is worth one. Probably the nicest addition to the Power Miners theme, a real foe, as opposed to regular little rock monsters, finally able to challenge those big and though mining vehicles.

The Crystal King itself is actually amazing, being 16cm tall, a giant compared to usual minifig and most vehicles, and possesing a lot of junctions, which allow a full set of movements: it can stand, ""walk"", grab things in its three-finger hands or completely rotare its forearm and shoulder.

The King structure also features a very good combination of old-style gray bricks and some new ones, like those long sharpen spikes (speaking of which, the tips are made of rubber, so they can be bended without trouble) or the head. Personally, I don't like big monolithic pieces, but this time it represents the best choice, allowing the large mouth to be more solid and resistent.

Two minifigs are also included, and the portable driller is a nice note, well integrating with the King.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

1.minifigs
Miner#1 is useful, he has a dual-sided head,a drill symbol is on the chest,and a metal plate on the head.he has a helmet with goggles.Printed legs and back. Miner#2 is not as good, but nice to have, he looks dirty and has a bomb symbol on the chest. another mutt williams hairpiece is super,but sadly no helmet. a helmet and hairpiece would be good.8/10.        

2.accessories
a stick of dynamite,4 trans-green crystals,and a drill.THe drill is x-tra good,because of nice desigs and pieces.it spins.9/10       

3.the crystal king
a dissapointment,i mean come on lego, it cant even eat the dynamite/crystals.they falll out.he has a nice-angeled neck and 3 new pieces (chest/arm armor.head and knifes)his legs is bad because they only have 2 joints and is too short.arms have 3 fingers, wich can hold a miner.head is also good, because it has jaws that move up and down, and 5 knives.

"legoguy2805","2010-01-24T11:35:15.263Z","RockRage... or is it?","This was, basically, THE set for 2009. When the first leaked images were released, people were amazed and desperately wanted the set to come out as soon as possible. Then eventually when it was showcased at ToyFair, some people didn't think it was as good as the leaks suggested, but still downright awesome: the king of the Rock Monsters!

Then in August it was released, and lots of Lego fans bought it. When the Power Miners website story section was updated to feature the summer 2009 Rock Monsters, Crystal King's name was actually RockRage, but later on it was changed to CrystalKing. This led to fanfics and speculation, but the name RockRage was probably a prototype name.

I however didn't receive this set until Christmas, with my brother. Here is what I thought of it:

Pros:
King of the Rock Monsters, duh
Stands up
No stickers!
Includes two miners with drill and dynamite
Posable limbs/fingers
Posable jaw

Cons:
Fingers fall off
Smaller than you'd expect him to be
Fingers can't really grip well
Giant hole in bottom of mouth, so if he eats anything it just falls out

Overall, it is a decent set, although not as good as some people expected him to be.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2010-03-04T17:53:39.263Z","Very nice design, but lacking in some posability.","<p>So, the Crystal King... First, the Minifigs.</p>
<p>First, you have a regular Power Miner.... Not much. I don't actually have these guys with me at the moment, so I'm doing it by memory.&nbsp;He also has a big drill which <i>looks</i> cool, but it can be hard to stand&nbsp;the fig&nbsp;up due to&nbsp;the drill's&nbsp;size. There is no function to turn the drill, you have to do it manually.</p>
<p>The other minifig is a little different. He's got the basic&nbsp;legs and body, but he has no helmet. Instead he has hair. It's an interesting move, but it's odd because he's one of the guys fighting the King. Shouldn't he have a helmet?</p>
<p>The Crystal King himself is a good looking figure. The only problem I have with his appearence&nbsp;are his feet.&nbsp;First of all, they're really flat.&nbsp;I think Lego could have incorporated some&nbsp;SNOT (Studs&nbsp;Not Only&nbsp;on Top) into the feet. It also could have easily had ball jointed ankles instead of hinges. This can be fixed, but I haven't because I don't have any of the needed pieces. Another minor&nbsp;problem is his mouth. Open, you can see a gaping hole between the top and bottom jaws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Color scheme is great. Mainly it's transparent green and shades of grey. Mainly it's Sulfurix or Geolix on a larger scale. He also has a cool new piece on his chest and hands. They seem to bee a remake of an older&nbsp;piece only&nbsp;with bumped up grey&nbsp;areas like the small rock monsters. Posability is... fine. He can open and close his mouth and also has&nbsp;two joints in his neck. He has ball jointed shoulders, but due to how they're hooked up, you&nbsp;can't get his arms straight down. Luckily, he has wrist ball joints and moveable fingers.&nbsp;Now to the legs. He has ball jointed hips, but no knees. And the&nbsp;inward hinges on his ankles make it even&nbsp;worse.</p>
<p>20&nbsp;dollars is an okay deal. 15 dollars would have been perfect, but I'm fine with 20. In conclusion this is worthy to be the&nbsp;King of the Rock Monsters. If&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;small&nbsp;vehicle,&nbsp;it would&nbsp;be better, but the drill works. I do recommend getting this set&nbsp;if you get the chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"AETerry","2010-10-13T14:01:13.693Z","Crystal King Review","<div class=""description""><p>I have had this set for a while now and am 
reviewing it now as my family recently went to LEGOland California. While watching their 4D Lego Movie with Clutch Powers, my daughter got 
very excited with how: Mama! You have that set! Referring of course, to the Crystal King 
who appears in it and this set review.</p><p>This is currently the only Power Miners set that I have. When I first saw 
Power Miners come out, I thought of the Rock Raiders from some years 
back. So not many of the sets have had me really wanting to get 
something that didn't feel like a repeat of an older theme. <br></p>

<p>At $20 the price is a bit steep... I'd have preferred $15 for this 
set. And I remember back to the 80's and mid 90's when if a set like 
this would have come out, it probably would have cost $10-$15... so a 
part of me wants to keep in mind inflation.<br></p><h4>Instructions</h4></div><p>The instructions are in booklet form following LEGO's clear, easy to follow step-by-step instructions. And as many newer sets are starting to show, there is also a listing of all the parts used in this set and their catalog number should replacements ever be needed.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a total of 168 pieces in this set. Most notable are the ball joint pieces for the arms of the Crystal King and his head which is fairly unique.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are two Power Miner Minifigures in this set. One carrying a bundle of dynamite in a desperate or bold move to try and blow up the Crystal King with and the other wields and carries a large mobile drill with which to try attacking the giant rock monster with. Both are very well detailed and the minifigure heads have dual printings on them so you can have some changes in expressions of determination or fear.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The main build of this set is the Crystal King himself. This is my first set making use of these ball-joint pieces and I must say, they have captured my imagination. The possibilities with these for other builds with Robots and even animals are endless.</p><p>He alternates with light and dark grey pieces and highlights of neon yellow crystals and spikes coming from his head and shoulders. He's fairly impressive and the finger are well articulated too, enough so you can pose the Crystal King as holding one of the Power Miner figures as they battle it out with him.</p><p>My one real 
complaint with him is the lack of knee articulation. It seems there could have been more and the legs look too short compared to the articulation of the arms.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This Crystal King set is definitely one of those LEGO sets that captures my imagination and speaks clearly to why it is I love LEGO and building with their bricks. He remains even today proudly displayed on my shelf of LEGO models for show. I just love this set and am very glad I picked it up when I did, even though I feel he's a bit pricey, he was well worth it.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
