They are basically the same set, but the 4 years between the release of this set 1992 (in the year 1993) and&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6591-1/Nitro-Dragsters"">6591</a>&nbsp;(in 1989) see some considerable changes - perhaps so Lego could&nbsp;release it at a cheaper price point? Again, it&#39;s another North America only set.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>The two dragsters are identical, with just some colour changes - in fact, the difference between the dragsters&nbsp;is only 6&nbsp;elements that change colour and a sticker, the other dozen or so elements&nbsp;are the same colour on both sets. The big wing/spoiler has a sticker, and is mounted surprisingly sturdily on the hinge arms at the rear - the same arm/spoiler design is used in several sets. The dragster racing lights are an identical build to&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6591-1/Nitro-Dragsters"">6591</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building is quick and simple - no challenges here at all. In fact, it&#39;s a very very simple design, with no small parts apart from the 1x1 round plates.&nbsp;The wheels just clip into standard&nbsp;axle plates.&nbsp;The end result looks pretty crude compared to&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6591-1/Nitro-Dragsters"">6591</a>&nbsp;and feels a little flimsy - but it all holds together well.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Nothing clever here. Just a bunch of standard bricks and plates. The 2397 black horse hitching piece is key to stability of the &quot;nose&quot; of the dragster - but the 2x10 plate still flexes under only a small load. It&#39;s as if someone at Lego used this set as a demonstration of how to take parts and complexity&nbsp;out of a product and ending up with (nearly) the same result at a much cheaper cost - there are stickers for the plain wing/spoiler (cheaper than printing for one set alone),&nbsp;the minifigs are identical to&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6591-1/Nitro-Dragsters"">6591</a>&nbsp;apart from different colour helmets, and the instructions change from a booklet to a single piece of folded A3 in this set.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some stats:&nbsp;<b>1992 vs 6591</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Part Count:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 104&nbsp; vs 144</li>
	<li>Different Elements:&nbsp;&nbsp;36&nbsp; vs&nbsp; 65</li>
	<li>Printed Parts:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; vs&nbsp; 4</li>
	<li>Stickered Parts:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 vs none</li>
</ul>

<p>So nearly half the number of different Lego elements in this set. And 9 elements/15 pieces make the identical lights build.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Great!&nbsp; Two dragsters and some start lights - perfect for bedroom carpet races! Even though the dragsters feel a bit flimsy, they are a lot more robust in play compared to&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6591-1/Nitro-Dragsters"">6591</a>&nbsp;(and its constantly falling-off goblet exhausts)&nbsp;and it&#39;s possible for small hands to zoom them across the bedroom floor no problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;I actually like this set for its playability - even thought the part count is small and the build is, frankly, a bit rubbish. I could be picky and say it could do with another minifig with a chequered flag - but I guess this wasn&#39;t possible at this price point. It&#39;s definitely a cheapo version of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6591-1/Nitro-Dragsters"">6591</a>&nbsp;, but a successful one at that.</p>

<p>So, whoever was tasked at Lego with taking cost out of&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6591-1/Nitro-Dragsters"">6591</a>&nbsp;without ruining the set, congratulations, you succeeded!</p>
