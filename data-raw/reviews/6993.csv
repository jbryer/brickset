<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Got it on sale! so was at a nice price point (I think this set was on sale at Shop@Home for the longest time)<br></li><li>It's got a rear entry platform. <br></li><li>Withstands play abuse well. Wings and wheels stick on tight.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Wheels are too tight for the kids to push in to the slot.<br></li></ul>
<p>At the 50% off price, this was a set which has endless playability since you can re-enact the TaleSpin series which is now double the fun.<br></p>",TRUE,5,3,2,5,4
