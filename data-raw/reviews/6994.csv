Where are you?","We love the colors of this sturdy plane that is mostly assembled when it arrives; it should withstand many take offs and landings in little and big hands. The medium blue and white color scheme with dark blue trim is outstanding. The roof easily opens to put up to six friends inside and it holds a crew of two. The captain is even smiling, which is reassuring.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The front stairs flip down, and passengers of all ages will love their flight. The rear door flips up for a roomy cargo bay. There are two large jet engines hanging from large wings that have studs on top for maintenance to access the area. This is a nice touch. There is a double landing gear with four wheels on each part. DUPLO did a first class job balancing the plane with this landing gear...it is quite stable unlike most toy planes. I have played with previous LEGO and DUPLO planes and feel that they were &nbsp;not as study and beautifully designed as this one, which is the first large one I have bought.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This is a huge plane measuring 19 in long by 9 in high by 20 in wide, so it does take a large space to set up the air terminal and ground crew with equipment. The wings are fixed requiring a great big box. The tower is quite functional with an expansive view of flight ops. Having done this job during college, I know first hand that fleet service workers perform many different tasks, which increases the play possibilities. Kids of all ages will enjoy this set, which is becoming rare and expensive. So do not dally if you want one of these and have the space it requires for play. &nbsp;</div></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

<br />
I personally enjoyed the build, and I really like the white/red motif on the control tower.<br />
<br />
The plane is simply too big and makes storage very difficult, but other than that, its a great set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Complete instructions for building the airport and plane, and accessories. I think there is even an alternate build</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some great parts, my favourite is the luggage turn table, as it can be used to add motion into lots of different Duplo builds. The plane is always a winner, and it has a lot of connection points for interesting hybrids, but is simply huge</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Lots of duplo minifigures, and large carrying capacity in the plane</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fun build, about as challenging as Duplo gets</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Lots of playability, and you can fly the airplane around the house on big trips</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Worthwhile set, but when I&#39;m trying to find somewhere to put the plane I sometimes regret it just a tiny bit ;)</p>
