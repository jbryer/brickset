<h4>Parts</h4><p>A great variety of parts (animal, figures and bricks), one of the largest sets in the Duplo family.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Simple, but adequate for this set.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Excellent quality and look.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Just perfect!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>One of the best Duplo sets of Lego. &nbsp;Has lot of animals, and great educational possibilities for the children.</p><p>We have a zoo nearby, and now we have our own zoo&nbsp;in-house&nbsp;for our kid to play with.</p><p>Our 2 years old boy was sooooooooo excited! At first with the size of the box and the images, but then...</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;Can not build anything yet, just placing bricks one on top of the other, but knows all the animals by name, brings them when asked to, etc. &nbsp;Quite familiar with the parts.</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,5
"LegoZoo_mommy","2012-02-07T13:42:49.133Z","Fantastic set with a lot of animals to entertain","<p>The Big City Zoo is a very nice set, full of lots of pieces and opportunity to build animal habitats for many different types of common zoo animals.&nbsp; As with other sets, it is defnitely helpful to have additional Duplo building blocks to expand on what the set itself provides.&nbsp; However, this is not essential with a large set like this, which does a decent job of providing several building suggestions in the instructions/box which are possible with the pieces provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My 2 1/2 year old loves this set, and is one of the few toys that will entertain her for 30 minutes or more, with or without my guidance.&nbsp; She does not yet understand how to mimic the pictures to build displays for the animals, but is able to build her own more simple ones with base plates and blocks.&nbsp; She&nbsp;loves to play with the animals, people, and flowers separately, and enjoys sorting by color, counting the pieces, etc.&nbsp; This is definitely a set she can continue to grow into as her skill level increases.&nbsp; It is durable enough that I have no doubt that my younger daughter will have years of fun with it too.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"stux","2014-02-10T02:19:56.133Z","Fantastic set for entertaining groups of children","<p>Bought this set for my 3yo daughter. She loves the Duplo animals and this delivers in spades.<br />
<br />
Provide a lot of fascinating duplo pieces, and we find that groups of 3-4 kids (even older ones) love playing together building zoos (with all the other sets)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are provided for each exhibit which makes for nice modular builds, but its quite easy to just free build a zoo</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Awesome range of fun and unique parts. The animals with babies are the real showcase</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Zoo animals and their babies and a zoo keeper. Worth it just for them.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for most Duplo is irrelevant, but it is nice being able to build and play with each exhibit separately</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great manifestation of your typical victorian city zoo</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The best Duplo set we ever bought</p>
