"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-07-26T23:58:49.763Z","Magnet series","Overall, this being my other purchase at the LEGO store (see my review for 7751) i'd have to say these things are pretty awesome. I had all the newest ones to pick from (including the silver stormtrooper) but my lack of Jedi was disturbing to me and thus i plucked this one from the rack. For $15, the price makes you sick to pay but all these figures are either discontinued (Obi-Wan) or in sets of twice the value of this magnet set or more. Of course this is unfortunately my 4th Chewbacca minifig, but of course the rest of it is worth it enough--and Chewie has a silver crossbow! In case no one else made it clear enough, these are 100% REAL, completely removable LEGO minifigures with real parts. I'd say these are a must have, since nearly all the figs in the magnet sets are in expensive sets or are no longer being produced...although there should be one last set with Wedge Antilles in there. High marks!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

set (852554) is a LEGO Magnets set which came out in 2008. It comes
with 3 basic minifigures which you can take off the magnet.<br><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifigure:</span><br><br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Chewbacca:</span>
Chewbacca looks pretty awsome. The weapon is nice for LEGO castle MOCs and Brickfilms and Chewies head is attached to his hair which is one big piece. His whole torso is brown.<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Obi-Wan Kenobi (Episode III style):</span></span></span> Obi-Wan looks cool. He comes with a headset, a brown hood and a brown cape. He also has a lightsaber and his basic jedi torso.<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Darth Vader:</span></span> Darth Vader looks cool. He has his red lightsaber and a cool helmet piece. His face shows you the burned face of Anakin Skywalker and he has nice markings on his suit.<br><br><br><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Positive:</span><br><br></p>

"Waytookeane","2011-02-13T13:54:46.497Z","Nice magnet set","<p>I bought these to add a little bit of character to my whiteboard in my study. I'm mad about Star Wars in general, and thought these were the perfect accompaniment to my other rather boring magnets on the board<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The mini figures are detachable from the magnet, so you can actually display any minifigs you like on the plinths</li><li>The minifigs are not glued together like the keyrings are, and their weapons are also removable</li><li>All minifigs have a weapon</li><li>The magnets are reasonably strong, and can support bits of paper stuck behind them (like I do on my whiteboard)</li></ul>
<h4><br></h4><h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Being detachable from the plinth is also a disadvantage if you're not careful, you may lose one</li><li>When pressed all the way home on to the studs, the figures have to bend forward slightly</li><li>Price is a little high for what you get</li></ul><br>Despite the price, I am pleased I got these magnets, they brighten up my workspace<br>

Shame about the Glue.","<p>Saw this set on the Lego Shop website and having purchased a different Star Wars magnet set (Mace Windu and Yoda etc) figured that these guys would detach from the magnets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How wrong I was!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Brilliant Minifigures with great details and weapons. Just a shame that LEGO realised people would buy this set for the minifigures and glued them to the magnets.</p>",TRUE,5,4,1,1,4
