So thank you Lego for at least providing us with all the required parts! I bought my two 8871 Extension Cables, and they work great!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

There is nothing too special except that it is&nbsp;great for betting lights or motors to places farther away from the battery box&nbsp;than you could normally go. I wanted to build a motorized and lit up LEGO city, so these were great for me.</p>
