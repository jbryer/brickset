This is not a bad looking car considering it is a Happy Meal giveaway. The chicken slope is printed and you get 2 sets of wheels. When will LEGO give sets away like this (or at least regular non-Biionicle sets) in Happy Meals in America?",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legocarnut2","2010-08-09T19:24:08.92Z","Pretty Good for a Happy Meal Toy...","Pros: Good parts, rare printed chicken head green slope piece, good wheels, uncommon pieces, OK to play with with if you are a kid since it is like a Hot Wheels Car...<br><br>Cons: Bad Build (which is expected), Not much to do with if you are not a kid.<br><br>Sum-Up: Good for a Happy Meal toy, not so great for a Lego set.<br>",TRUE,3,5,1,2,5
"Pepper","2011-03-13T18:31:43.82Z","nothing better than free legos!","<p>This is a set that was available from McDonalds back in 1998. It mostly includes normal bricks, plates, and slopes, along with some wheels.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>printed brick 
<li>usefull basic parts</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>boring build</li></ul>
<p>This set is not very good, but what can you expect from a freebie? The only thing mildly interesting is the brick with the McDonalds chicken, whose name eludes me, that is printed on it. I would not reccommend it, unless you can find it for dirt cheap.</p>",TRUE,2,2,1,2,5
