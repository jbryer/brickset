"PluffTed","2009-03-11T22:17:10.09Z","Mini General Grievous' Starfighter","I got this set today at Target. Many are struggling to get this set and the mini V-19 Torrent which I also own. To find this set, go to the easter section and you'll find a box full of both of them near the bottom of the aisle. Anyone can find these 2 in many U.S. Targets. I think this set is very detailed and alike to the bigger size. I recommend this set to many young lego star wars collecters.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Carl","2009-11-12T21:29:11.17Z","Square front","Don't let the title put you off this set. Because if it does, then you'll be missing out on something really awesome. The color scheme is exactly right, and the cockpit and engine designs are great. The jets at the front are great, but as my title suggests, the front is a bit square, whereas in the bigger model the front is diagonal.

Pros:

Color Scheme
Cockpit
Engines
Front Jets
Design

Cons:

Square Front
NO GUNS!

Other than those two cons, the Mini version of General Grievous' Star-fighter is a great buy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MandalorianCandidate","2009-04-08T15:05:12.28Z","Another worthy MINI model","This is the second MINI entry for 2009, the other being the 8031 V-19 Torrent, and while it is a nice sculpt/build/design/whatever, it just doesn’t have the same WOW factor for me.  Probably because the ship itself hasn’t had that much screen time and we haven’t seen it in fighting mode.  Nevertheless, I heartily welcome this addition to the pantheon of MINI sets Lego has bestowed upon us.

Anyhoo, not a lot to say here, because after all it is a MINI, other than it is a faithful reproduction of the larger scale model.  In general, the MINIs are tops because of their compact size and low price.  I think they’re tough to mess up, but it’s happened before (see the 4486 AT-ST), but I appreciate the work and creativity it takes to make a sturdy model with smaller Lego pieces.  That being said, this little guy doesn’t disappoint and is very close proportion-wise to the 7656 version from 2007.  They kept the color scheme the same and put the cockpit well away from the front engine nacelles.

The part mix is OK, though not a whole lot to use for serious modding.  There’s a couple of cones, some dark brown and tan tiles, some 1x1 slopes and the other group of small greebly pieces along with a few technic-type parts thrown in for good measure.

It is a short build, only took me like 5 minutes, and there are less than 50 pieces. But it still a fun (short) build, with some cool pieces. Pros and cons -

Pros:
Nice pieces
Good amount of pieces for the price
Cool looking MINI

Cons:
A little too simple

This is a great set but I'd overall rate it 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Be_Burger","2010-12-30T02:12:11.173Z","General Grievous Mini Escape!","This is an excellent MINI set. I think 
it costs around $4, you used to be able to find them in Target, but it is retired by now. The build only took me around 5 minutes. Still I liked some of the techniques they used, it taught me a couple things actually. Sadly, there are not very many pieces, and not even all of those are used.
