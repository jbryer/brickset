I think I spent a good 12 months looking at it, so when I got it for Christmas in 1979 I was beside myself.<div><br></div><div>Christmas day was normally spent driving to the city to catch up with family and I quite clearly remember the agony of having to leave it behind and wait a couple of weeks before we returned to get stuck into building it.</div><div><br></div><div>Once started it was quite an easy build, it just took time. There was one bit from memory that did confuse me, and I think it did every time I made it, but I think it was more a situation of being hasty in my building rather than having a good proper look at the instructions.</div><div>The string was little annoying, but also required. I seemed to continually make the string too tight which caused all the masts to go onto an angle which was not a good look. My Dad was a perfectionist in these sort of things so I would normally wait for him to get home from work and fix it up for me.</div><div>There were a few pieces that would break pretty easy if touched but it was more something to display rather than play with.</div><div>Overall it was pretty detailed construction, especially considering there were not many 'custom' bits and made primarily of the standard Lego bricks.</div><div><br></div><div>It was fantastic that the ship also had a base to stand on for display purposes.</div><div><br></div><div>Now my son is getting into Lego as well, and even though his is only 4 1/2, he definitely likes the 'proper' Lego sets, he has never really been into the duplo stuff. But his interest has rekindled my interest in Lego and i think it may be time to do the USS Constellation again!</div><div><br></div><div>I have this set in pretty good shape and I'm pretty confident of all pieces being there, but thank heavens for sites like BrickSet and Perron to cover those pieces that I may be missing.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a prized possession and well worth the time spent to build it. Not really something to play with bit something to put on display.</div><div><br></div><div>Does make me wonder though why Lego didn't do any more of these type of ships?</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
