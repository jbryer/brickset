"samuraiturtle","2009-11-03T03:58:16.39Z","Lets Hack Some Rocks Up","I mostly got this set for the orange claw and maybe for the blue crystal.  This is a good set if not small one.  I also got the 8908 Monster Launcher with this set and I think this is the better set of the two.  If you can find it and want some Power Miners this is an OK set.  (If I remember it was only available at Target for the 2009 fall quarter.)  I also think this was a better deal than the 8956 Stone Chopper if you combine this set with the 8908 Monster Launcher for the price.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

My friend got this set to me when he visited Legoland California last week.  I built this model in a few minutes since I was in a car at the time.  The instructions are like that of any impulse set's.  Now onto the pros and cons!

Pros : Cool double headed minifigure!
The claw actually goes up and down!
Blue crystal!
4 nice sized wheels!
Cons : Once the set is built, there are no spare pieces!

I'll still give this set a 10/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2009-11-05T20:15:02.653Z","Great Impulse Set","Power Miners have really grown on me. I've become a sucker for lime green LEGO and the PM minifigs themselves are really cool. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the head has 2 expressions. I don't know what the first reviewer was talking about when he said this set didn't come with spare parts. They come with an extra lime cheese slope, 2 extra control hinges, 2 extra lime round plates and 2 extra Technic connectors for a total of 7 extra pieces. The set itself comes with 2 lime 1x2 plates and a lime curved 1x3 slope.
The set itself looks cute and fits in well next to other PM sets but it is basic and small! It is an Impulse set so this isn't a complaint just pointing out the obvious. You can move the arm on the vehicle up and down which is a neat play feature. The blue crystal is cool as I didn't own this piece before buying this set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The set comes with a drill piece, a miner, and a blue energy crystal. It is on wheels, which is good. It had a lot of extra pieces, including 3 gear shifts. I just put 1 gear shift on each side and continued playing. :)

Overall - A good set, if you like Power Miners, you should get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
