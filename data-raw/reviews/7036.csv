"samuraiturtle","2009-11-03T04:13:55.373Z","Lets Launch This Thing","I felt this set was lacking some thing.  One thing that could of improve the set would of been another crystal and maybe a plate for the catapult.  I got the 8907 Rock Hacker at the same time as this set and I think the 8907 Rock Hacker is the better of the two.  The only reason I think anyone would get this set is for the Rock Monster.  But if you combine this set with the 8907 Rock Hacker it is a better deal than the 8956 Stone Chopper.  (I am assuming you can still get this set.  It was found only at Target Stores for the 2009 fall quarter.)  ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Tommy_60","2009-11-04T19:28:14.607Z","It works!","My friend got me this set along with the rock hacker when he went to Legoland California last week.  I love this set!  The catapult function actually works!  If you hit it hard enough, the rockmonster or whatever you're catapulting can go up to 7 feet!  Maybe farther!  

Pros : The catapult works!
Sulfurix rockmonster included!
Yellow crystal!
3 2x3 slanted bricks!
There are extra pieces!  Tons of 'em!
Cons : WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD THIS SET HAVE CONS?!?!?!?!?!?!  Lego made it, thus it's perfect!

Overall rating : 100/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2009-11-05T20:25:16.513Z","Not Much in the Bag","This set has a grand total of 12 parts! I bought this set simply for the Rock Monster. It does launch like it shows on the package which is a cool play feature but you get what you see with this set. Not even any extra parts. I now have 5 of these little Rock Monsters so if I want to make a Power Miners scene I have the Rock Monsters to do so. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"jonbuddy","2009-11-18T18:24:58.17Z","1 monster + 1 energy crystal + a flinger= Tons of comical action!","Although SOME people think this set stinks because of it having only 12 pieces, I think it's still nice. When you can get a chance to fling rock monsters (and maybe fling them far), why would you pass up this set?

Overall - This set is good, the flinging is fun, and you get a green rock monster. Cool, right?

P.S. Did I mention flinging? :P",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"TheFadedTBCap","2010-10-23T22:14:09.52Z","Nice Little Set","<p>This a pretty good set.&nbsp; It needs a power miner to fight Sulfurix though and it was very expensive.&nbsp; It does make a good addition to the&nbsp;Power Miners collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sulfurix</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canapult really works</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comes with crystal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not a lot of pieces (only twelve)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very expensive (or thats just the price I paid)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This definitely a solid set.&nbsp; Could use more pieces or something small added to it, but it is still a fun set to play with.&nbsp; I give it a 3.5/5 or 7/10!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,3
