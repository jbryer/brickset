As you never need more than two each for this set, you can use them for two ferries if you manage to get another 31 printed 1x6 bricks with blue window pattern :-)

The vessel's name may be chosen between &quot;Silja Serenade&quot;, &quot;Silja Symphony&quot; (as mentioned by Dirk), &quot;Stockholm&quot; and a fourth name I can't tell as I'm missing the stickers on my sheet.

I really like the details of this set that were only possible by creating it 8-wide. 

This is the only promotional ferry that can be opened at both sides, unfortunately the two little cars get stuck in the ferry regularly (therefore the rating 9).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Tomie","2023-01-02T10:47:01.04Z","Lego Silja Line Ferry 1998-1 set review","<p>I think the set is pretty unique in&nbsp;its own way. It&#39;s such a simple concept, yet it&#39;s so well executed which is why it stands out from other Lego boats/ships! There are not a lot of things to say about the parts, as their mostly just regular parts. Yet they have added a few nice details to them! So that&#39;s a bonus.</p>

<p>The set isn&#39;t the most compatible with Minifigures due to its size in my opinion. But I think it&#39;s mostly meant for the adult/teenager collectors, so you don&#39;t really need them for display use right?</p>

<p>As a Finnish person I really appreciate this set, as I used to travel with Silja Line during my childhood a bunch. So I&#39;m glad I could get my hands on this rare set!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a 4.5/5? set.&nbsp;</p>
