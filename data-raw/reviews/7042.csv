I got this for the minifig. He is cool. Ben ( Obi-Wan)'s head is better then the stupid new one in the landspeeder. His torso is very nice also.

The watch works good and so far nothing bad happened! ( It's just the 1st day). So I like this set a lot and all the watch's have minifigs. the ones that sort of like this one.

The Obi Wan figure appears to have a unique Jedi torso compared to others. The watch works well,&nbsp;although&nbsp;I don't use it. If you&nbsp;mainly want to get Obi Wan then you should get this set. It is a cheap way of getting a rare figure that is rarely seen in current Lego Star Wars Sets. However the only parts are that of the minifigure itself and pieces to add on the watch. There is not much of a playability to this set because again, you only get Obi Wan Kenobi.&nbsp;However it is worth, that is if you want a cheap way to get Obi Wan Kenobi.",FALSE,4,2,2,1,4

It comes with a piece that you can connect Lego pieces to so you could make a spy watch, but the pieces won't be steady.&nbsp;The Obi-Wan is defnetely worth&nbsp;buying the watch. However, I lost a conecting strap for the watch so the whole thing won't be able to go on my arm again. I sometimes use it for a working&nbsp;clock tower in my city. If you buy this set, be careful not to lose one of the black pieces on the end. Without those, the watch is workless.",FALSE,3,3,3,2,3
