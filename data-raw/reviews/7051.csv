"garthd","2009-07-08T20:07:17.687Z","My new all time favorite","A little quick background first:

-I operate snow groomers for a living
-I've been building LEGO groomers since I was 5 years old
-I've been waiting for this for more than 20 years!

I received the Summer 2009 LEGO Catalog last week and was flipping through it finding many interesting new items, when I came to the Technic section.  I have always loved this line, but have not found much that intrigued me lately.  My eyes scanned the page and saw the kit I'd been waiting for for so long:  a snow groomer.  I ordered it immediately, and impatiently awaited its arrival.  

When it came, I started building immediately.  There are 2 instruction books, one for the groomer and the other for the snow tractor with dumper.  I tried to build slowly, as much of my enjoyment comes from construction.  It took me about 2 hours, taking my time.  This set has great features, including:

-moving tracks
-blade that moves in 4 directions (and can be easily modified for 6)
-lifting and swinging tiller

I plan to modify (and already have in some cases):
-lights; there aren't enough
-the tiller has too few grinding bits
-flipping the black panels on the tiller gives more realism
-the blade wings will receive pieces to make them swing like the real thing


Overall, this is truly my new favorite set of all time.  Great fun to build, modify and to play with!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

My first impression of the set was that the piece tolerances are way down from where they used to be, making it much more difficult to get long pins through more than on block. I am not taking any points of the rating for this set as that is just the way Technic appears to be right now.

The set itself is a very interesting build. It is much more modularly built that you would expect which helps with keeping the build interesting.

The instructions took some getting used to to be able to tell the black pieces from the dark gray pieces. The use of the Bionicle pieces for finishing body plates and the plow itself was a very good idea and keeps the set feeling authentic.

Other than the instructions there are a few other complaints. 
First off the rear plow segment that raises and lowers can be a bit difficult to pull up because of the gearing used.
Second, the tracks seem too big, but you can't take out a link and still attach them, it would have been nice if the track guides could have been a tiny bit further apart.
Third, it doesn't have quite the level of functionality that I thought was available in Technic sets.

Over all this is a great set though. I would recommend it to any Technic collector. It is also a huge bonus that you get all the tank treads. I want to get another Snow Groomer to build the alternate model with, as it looks fabulous.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I wont list all the things that make it look awesome, because that's everything. The build is also fun, slightly challenging. You get a huge number of parts with it also.

<p>I picked a new copy this set up a little while after it had been discontinued.&nbsp; I really like the subject, which is fairly unique among Lego sets, and I thought the set looked pretty good from all of the pictures I had seen.&nbsp; I finally got around to building it a month or so ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My 9-year-old and I worked as a team to put this set together.&nbsp; I think it took us a little less than two hours to finish, and it was a pretty enjoyable process, especially building the joystick mechanism, which is the key mechanical feature of the model.&nbsp; As another reviewer points out, there is a good degree of modularity in the build.&nbsp; I did find some of the design choices a little bit unusual, though -- especially how&nbsp;the 5.5L axles were used to offset the&nbsp;rear wheel groups&nbsp;a half a&nbsp;stud relative to the front wheel groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to say that when the model is built, it looks every bit as fantastic as it did in the pictures.&nbsp; It is absolutely recognizable as a Pisten Bully.&nbsp; The details are all pretty much exactly as they should be -- from the color and shape of the plow blade to the exhaust stack behind the cab.&nbsp; In addition to the great appearance, the model also has a very solid feel to it -- like you could drop it from waist-high and it would still hold together pretty well.&nbsp; That isn't the case with all Technic models.</p>
<p>The completed snow groomer has two functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Plow blade is connected to a joystick control behind the cab.&nbsp; Pulling the joystick backward or pushing it forward&nbsp;raises or lowers the blade.&nbsp; Pushing the joystick to the left or right causes the blade to angle to the left or right. 
<li>The tiller attachment at the rear is raised or lowered via a gear knob located near the rear of the chassis.</li></ul>
<p>The plow blade joystick works pretty well, and it is pretty unique among all of the Technic sets, but I would have preferred that it have a little more travel in both the up/down and left/right directions.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is a lot of fun to operate it.&nbsp; The tiller raise/lower mechanism also works reasonably well, but the tiller tends to flop around until it is fully raised, which doesn't seem particulary realistic.&nbsp; I suppose that the floppiness during the raise/lower process was a necessary compromise to allow the tiller to drag freely behind the groomer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as the parts inventory goes, all I have to say is that the set includes 66 of the newer Technic tread links (in black, which is a great color for them).&nbsp; If you've ever tried to buy these on Bricklink, then you already know that they are not cheap.&nbsp; This set also includes four of H-shaped 5x11 frames, which are somewhat rare, and a nice assortment of black and red Technic panels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, while this Technic model falls a little short in the functionality department, it derfinitely makes up for it in looks and in parts inventory.&nbsp; At its original price of $50 (US), it is a steal.&nbsp; I am happy to have found a new copy of it for just a few dollars above the original list.&nbsp;In my opinion, if you can find it new for $70 or less, it's worth a look.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4
