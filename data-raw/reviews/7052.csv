"hewman","2009-02-16T19:36:32.7Z","Bargain rare minifigs","Just to be clear and even though others have posted this in other magnet reviews, the figs are exactly the same as those in the sets, there is no glue and they all come apart and they are just attached to the brick by two studs in the back of legs like clicking any regular lego pieces together.

There are some great touches with these figs, Yoda's head has molded hair at the back which looks great. Dooku's torso is more detailed than the Dooku that came with the set with Yoda all those years ago.

Mace's and Yoda's saber hilts are the newish pearl silver, while Dooku's is exactly the same as the one that came with him years ago in chrome silver and they sell for a packet on bricklink.

Unlike some of the characters (cough Obi) I think Yoda and Dooku work great in Clone Wars style. Mace isn't the most exciting fig and I still prefer the one from the Clone Turbo Tank, but hey for $17 AU, I can't complain.

The magnets themselves are very strong and stick well to my fridge. I put a bunch of other figs on them that I don't care if they get knocked to the ground.

The only slight negative is that on the capes on these magnet sets you can get a bit of wrinkling as they don't come in the little boxes like they do in the sets but that is a very minor complaint.

My suggestion: buy them before they sell out!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lambman","2009-03-21T14:53:17.39Z","Rare Figs in a cheap set=AWESOME","I got this set for my b-day, and I was worried because I thought the figs wouldnt come off the magnets, so I was relieved when I opened it and saw that they deatach from the magnet bricks with ease. So I will review each minifig.

Yoda is awsome in his CW form. I actually like him more than the normal one! He is also accurate, with grey hair on the back of his head. He also has a semi-shiny pearly silvery type lightsaber which is way better than those boring grey ones. 10\10

Dooku is cool, too. Even though he's a little on the scary side, he has an awsome new hairpiece and a bent lightsaber, an accurate touch. His body is more detailed than the original one, and overall, he is much better. 9/10

Mace is cool. There is not much else to say. 10/10

Thank you for reading my review!
Have a good day! Shane or Lambman, or both!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ShatteredGnome","2009-05-16T18:35:53.293Z","Definitely Awesome.","There's not a whole lot to say about this magnet set. You get Yoda, Count Dooku, and Mace Windu, all in Clone Wars form. They do come off the bases, and can be taken apart like normal minifigures, so you can use them like minifigures from normal sets.<br><br>Yoda is very well done, with new gray hair added to his redesigned look. His head is rubbery like the Plo Koon and Kit Fisto minifigures are. Mace is nicely designed as well, with new robes and a deeper purple lightsaber than before. Both have lightsaber hilts that are the new pearl silver. Count Dooku is excellently detailed, and has the same saber as he has in the Episode II set he came in, with a chrome hilt. This set is pretty good for the three minifigs, even if  it is $15.<br><br>I give it 5/5, even if it's not the best value.",TRUE,5,5,2,5,4
"Darth_Sidious2","2010-01-25T14:21:53.56Z","Excellent Value","As said below, this magnet set features detachable mini figures.  You get Yoda, Mace Windu and a Sith lord, Count Dooku, for $14.99. They are the clone wars style figures. 

In terms of value, this will have a great resell value. Each figure only appears once, in a $50, $55 and $60 set. They are also very significant characters. 

My only gripe with this set is that it is made with cheaper plastics, compared to the figures included in sets. Their right arm features ""LEGO"" engraved, the weight is slightly lighter. Count Dooku's cape is forced into a bent position, thanks to the packaging. Even 2 days under 60 pound weights and a textbook could only fix his cape slightly.

Overall: Get at least one before it runs out. 3 important characters, $15 and plenty of money in the future.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
