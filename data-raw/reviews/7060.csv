The minifigs are completely normal and they each come with special grey magnet pieces that they stand on. $5 per minifig is expensive, but considering what they went for on the after market prior to this set's release, it's priced fairly. I'll use the magnets for some other figures that I have extras of.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
