There is no glue on any parts so you can customize any minifig. Here are pros and cons 

                     Pros:
                           Darth Maul Minifig with all accessories( hood, lightsaber, cape, etc.)
                        Anakin as a boy with a wrench.
                          Naboo fighter pilot and a new-style gun (with helmet and goggles) 
                               So, you get a lightsaber(double), gun, and a wrench. 
                             
                          cons 
  
                                  could come with someone better than pilot

                               great set with great minifigs get it before it goes out of stock!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
