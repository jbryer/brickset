Without them (and possibly with, I couldn&#39;t find &#39;em online), it&#39;s near-impossible to play. The gameplay is confusing and the terrain is cluttered.</p>

<p>From my &quot;playthrough,&quot; I could not complete a single level. The farthest I managed to get was using Kopaka and Lewa, with Gali as a runner up. Everyone else was far too hard. I much prefer the PC version, ah the awesome memories.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to say, if you can even find this for sale, don&#39;t waste your money. I&#39;m holding onto mine simply because it&#39;s a BIONICLE game, and I can&#39;t sell anything related to BIONICLE. xD</p>
