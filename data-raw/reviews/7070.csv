However, once i saw this magnet set i just had to have it! The characters just look so lively, like each one has a story. This is the ONLY pirate set i have purchased since coming out of my dark ages and i display it proudly in my cubicle at work. <br></p><p>Here's the good stuff,<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>GREAT looking minifigs! If all pirate figures look like this i might have to reconsider which themes i collect.<br></li><li>The minifigs are NOT glued to the magnet! I can take them off and pose them or swap accessories as much as i want.</li><li>Accessories! Each character has his own hat, weapon, and ""extra"" (spyglass, parrot, hook)<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Building experience scored low because you pretty much just take them out of the packaging and stick them on a wall. Not very involved, but hey, they're magnets.<br></li><li>(not really a con)<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>I started collecting magnet sets once i heard that LEGO was going to be gluing the new ones down. I don't mind the lower quality chinese models but i DO want to be able to use those magnets for other things if i so choose. This set was the first of many magnet sets that i purchase and it is by far my favorite! <br></p><p>Buy it now if you still can!<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
