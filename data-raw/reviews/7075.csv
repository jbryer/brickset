"AddictedToStyrene","2012-04-09T21:09:09.02Z","Glued together but still look great with additional Lego","<p>These bookends are made from Lego bricks, but glued together. The Lego logo is painted on. They are great bookends, and you can still add Lego to them.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
	<li>They do the job - they are bookends.</li>
	<li>You can add Lego to them. I made figures specific to the shelves I used them on. In my case, James Bond and Discworld Lego! (Now those are themes TLC could consider licensing!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>They are made from real Lego Bricks (red 2 x 3, 2 x 4 and 2 x 8, classic!) but glued together. You probably won&#39;t be able to make them into a billboard for your Lego town layout.</li>
	<li>If you do add figures to them, be careful that they won&#39;t be knocked off by the books. Also remember that on the shelf, it might be hard to see the extra work you have put into them.</li>
</ul>

<p>These bookends work fine, and would look best on a shelf big enough to show them off, while still holding up your collection of fine Lego reading.</p>
