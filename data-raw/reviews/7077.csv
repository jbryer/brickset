"bluemoose","2009-03-03T15:07:18.547Z","Shame about the Space figs","One thing detracts from this set - the printing of the Space logo on the Space figs, which is too low compared to the original figs from the late 1970's & early 1980's. The red Space fig in the 'vol. 1' set has the logo printed at the correct position.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Minifig_Man","2009-04-01T05:39:22.64Z","Sloppy work","Apart from the differences in helmets and logo print on the spacemen that have been pointed out before, it's strange that TLC chose to put two classic spacemen in one collection. Why not a knight, archer or policeman?

The other three are good examples of classic minifigs though.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"andy0002","2009-07-28T21:20:54.233Z","crappiest printed minifigs of my collection.","i garantee that if u buy this set youll agree these are awful. the printing is all screwed up. compare a picture of the ninja to an actual lego ninja fig thats red. the one in this set is like darker or something. the plastic is very strange and in spots(idk what to really refer to this as) its like its so thin it doesnt have much color at all.the space men are nice, but their helmets are NOT correct. there new ones, and therefore making this set even more awful. the mailman is boring. i never was a big fan of city, because its just boring. again, strange red color. the 3 MFs to the left all have the most screwed up faces. just look at it and youll be able to figure out exactly what im talking about. their eyes are gigantic! idk if the pirates vest is supposed to be like this or not, but its very bright. i found the older version of that fig in a used toystore and it was much darker than that, and well his face again looks suckish( think it was supposed to look like that, i dont know.)

if ur buying this for the ninja and dont care about it being a misfit minifig with awful color, go ahead and buy this but the rest probably mean nothing to you. (i was this person at the time i bought it and it just looked amazing that i didnt care about the plastic. i found the helmet at that same toy store and the printing is awful, but still. its ninja, very rare.)

if ur a big space fan and want the figures for this reason, then definatly get it. i dont really care about the helmet much. not a whole lot of difference i dont think.( this is who i am now, a space fan, specially the SP3, and could use these ancient space commanders as the ""justice league"" type thing once ive got all the colors)

if u want this for the mailman....all i can say is u have one strange taste in figs my friend. i hate him. XD

not worth it if u ask me. altough i think it should be lowered to either 15 or 10 dollars because for awful printing, a boring mail man, no weapons.....ect..... this set just isnt worth 17 bucks.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Z_wing","2010-02-17T07:49:57.95Z","I got this at a good price!","<p>I was lucky, I managed to get this set in a sale for &pound;5.00 instead of &pound;12.00.</p>
<h4>Building experience</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can tell by looking at the picture that there is no building experience in this set as the figures are already built so I cannot really give this a rating.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>You do get some air tanks for the spacemen and headgear for the ninja (My personal favorite) but from what I hear, the parts are not the same as the real figure parts (I cannot really tell myself, but I don't have any of the old figures that these figures were based on)</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>These figures are meant for display so they do not really have any playability (unless you make them fight each other) :)</p>
<h4>Value for money</h4>
<p>I agree with other reviewers on this set that &pound;12.00 is overpriced for five figures but if you never had any of these figures and can find them in a sale like I did, buy them (you will not regret it)</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Good if you never had the original figures</li>
    <li>Headgear and air tanks&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    <li>&pound;12.00 is overpriced</li>
    <li>Not the same as the originals</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find my review helpful</p>
