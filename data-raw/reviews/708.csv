<br>
But I do have a lot of fond memories looking through this book! I have always had a lot of the classic space stuff, so this book was perfect for me. I didn't build the stuff with instructions that I remember, it was more pulling ideas from the upper pictures. I pulled out my collection to add to my sons this past weekend, and was going through everything, and that book brought back the most memories of all. It is now in shambles and missing the the cover and first inside pages, but I will save it in sheets (now that I'm old enough to appreciate it) and use it for years to come with my boy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-06-20T03:02:05.14Z","Strange But True","<p>This is the 1985 Ideas Book from The Lego Group. Very European in&nbsp;style to my mind it has a more graphic impression on its snazzy 1980&#39;s cover and an inner page full of multilingual description with relevant country flags to indicate section. The contents page then has a picture for each themed section and is laid out thus:</p>

<div>Basic 5-7</div>

<div>Basic 7-12</div>

<div>Legoland 5-12 (Town)</div>

<div>Legoland 5-12 (Space)</div>

<div>Legoland 5-12 (Castle)</div>

<div>Legoland+Basic 5-12</div>

<div>(Something of a theme mash-up!).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Instruction Manual</b></div>

<div>The book &#39;gets on with it&#39; so to speak and while&nbsp;packed even more full of ideas than it&#39;s predecessor, the immediately obvious lack of story makes a more technical and cooler read. Personally I found the story basis of the previous book wholly more enjoyable as opposed to a collection of instructions but it is an ideas book and this one is clearly an alternative approach.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>It starts with a cargo depot and you can see a smaller portion at the top of the pages is dedicated to an example scene picture, for demonstrating the models placement and possible use.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This format continues with aeroplanes and airport scene - very basic but with a now poo-pooed building technique! A plate is jammed sideways into some studs for a tail. Its then followed with a motorised train, helicopter, truck F1 cars, quite decent construction vehicles (no I don&#39;t have the parts!), a lovely cafe, car, tow truck, taxi, fire engine and police helicopter.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>By this point you realise that intermittent scene photography features throughout so while alot of ideas are featured there are also plenty of full page scene pictures.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Space theme&nbsp;makes its entrance with a fleet of ships and buggies but none really as good as the sets out there. This section is crowned with a sort of base and some really rather good robots. They are comical, varied and tower over minifigures. Watch out for the cyber space-horses.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Castle provides some traditional theme construction with a section of wall and a drawbridge with Black Falcons standing guard. Next is a wagon carrying a knight while some really nice pictures full of people and battle continue. Guard boxes are a fun feature and make a smaller/ simpler build while the next scene has plenty of green and detail in the models. You realise that there are excellent ideas by this stage and the book concludes with a farm picture (with strange unidentifiable creature) and a scene of Lego theme chaos. Honest, Space clashes with Basic, Town and Castle bricks in a total riot layout but the next page is nice with Townspeople stepping off a craft on to a moonbase.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Stickers. As usual a beautiful array of stickers are provided for ruining bricks or scabbing up over time. Either use them, lose them, use them and lose them or just eat them. Very nice to keep, I still recommend sticking on to card and clipping in to a model than directly on to if you wish to make use of them. White tac? Better is to keep tiles spare to sticker up and then attach when needed... if you have far too much time on your hands.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>More Is Less?</b></div>

<div>While extensive, I found this a weaker book than the last due to strange directions and not so enjoyable pictures. Lower angle photography seemed to make happier child level views into layouts last time around but judging this book alone for its merits I would not deny that it is a complete and successful ideas book, just not the most charming.</div>
