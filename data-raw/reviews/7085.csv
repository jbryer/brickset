"Lost_Cosmonaut","2009-04-17T03:19:50.013Z","Possibly the best LEGO train of all time.","I picked this one up on the day of release, the 15th.  Finally had time to build it today (the 16th).  This was one of the most satisfying builds I've had in some time.  It's a long build and somewhat complicated, and lots and lots of little pieces.

You can really see an attention to detail.  The new larger wheels with a working driveshaft system that will turn when motorized really kick it up.  The engineering room is amazingly detailed, even having a little door to close over the firebox.  DUPLOizing is thankfully to an absolute minimum with the largest piece being the floor plate for the passenger car.  There are also few stickers and NO multi-piece stickers.  LEGO obviously did their homework.  The design of the train is absolutely gorgeous, I've been dying for a LEGO train of this styling for some time.  The inspiration for this train comes from when steam trains were a dying breed, but represented some of the biggest, heaviest, hardest pulling trains ever seen.  It's nice to see them do a train that's not a generic ""old western"" style steam engine, or some plain generic diesel engine.  The passenger car is also nicely detailed.  One thing really nice is that the whole set is much more ""in scale"" with the mini-figs than other train sets we've seen in the past.  It makes the whole thing HUGE, but it looks massive and impressive like a true steam engine should when the mini-figs are posed next to it.

PROS:

- Gorgeous styling
- Incredible detail
- New wheels
- More ""in scale"" with the figures than previous trains
- MASSIVE, HEAVY, HUGE, and all that good stuff!
- Minimal stickers

CONS:

- Could have used at least one more mini-fig (a second engineer would have been perfect, trains of this size would have never been run by a single engineer!)
- Fitting the power-functions removes the nice detail of the engine room

Caveat:  I haven't dug out my older trains, so I don't know if this train will work with any of the older 9v/RC rails.  The new flex-rails don't seem to be compatible, but I don't know if there's a difference in the train itself.  It does use several of the original train trucks (for the tender and the passenger car) so I have to imagine that it IS compatible with the older 9v/RC rails.  I can imagine this thing would look very sweet in combination with 10027-1 Train Engine Shed!

All in all, this is a great set.  A MUST have for ANY train lover, LEGO or otherwise!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sjuip","2009-04-23T17:28:38.7Z","Fabulous design!","Just received the set today. Building the engine alone took two hours - this set is definitely not meant for the inexperienced!

In addition to Lost Cosmonaut's review:
- Yes, it looks very nice together with Train Shed 10027 - but it does not fit INTO the shed (the engine is wider than the 8 studs openings of the shed). This is more of a CON of the 10027 shed than it is of this nicely detailed steam engine.
- Yes, the new flexible train tracks are compatible with the 9V and RC tracks. The new flex-tracks offer great opportunities for modelling. Disadvantage is that a train doesn't glide very smoothly over them. There's more friction and more noise - very un-train-ish noise, I would say. Even with the these nice new big train wheels!
- For the real train addict: I think a 2-C-2 wheel arrangement would have made the engine look even better than the present 2-C-1. I put in an extra pair of wheels underneath the cabin and now it looks more balanced.

"Teez","2009-06-03T00:08:19.61Z","Beautiful set","This is my first Lego train set and I have to admit I'm smitten with it. It really is a beautiful model. The Emerald Express is well-detailed and offers interesting views from every angle, and has a very pleasing color scheme. The interior of the passenger/dining car is reasonably appointed given the size limitations, as is the engine car. The tender is empty; it is used to house the battery if you have the Power Functions.

I have only one negative comment about this set: the dreaded stickers. The problem with the ones provided is that each one covers the entire brick with a transparent background. While this may help with aligning & centering the sticker, it also results in annoying fingerprints. I'm not an expert model-maker or anything, but I don't know of any way to avoid this problem. I realize that it's expensive to create bricks with pre-printed decals -- and Lego is already expensive enough! -- but the company seriously needs to look into this issue.

The Emerald Express took me a few hours to assemble and involved relatively simple building techniques. Nothing too complex for the stated 14+ year-old target audience. There are a large number of small 1x1 pieces that may prove frustrating to some builders with less patience.

"bappsy","2009-04-25T05:39:08.513Z","full steam ahead!","Received my Emerald Night Train on April 20th, and it is an excellent model.

I didn't want to shell out the extra Â£90 for the full motorised version, so I have powered it using the 9v (6x1.5v AA) Power Functions Battery Box #8881. This doesn't look great and I had to modify he tender a little to fit it in, but it does the job. 

I'm controlling the train with the Power Functions IR Remote Controller #8885, which doesn't have variable speed control.

Here's what it looks like, running on 9v lego tracks:

"AlterBrick__Vienna__Austria","2009-06-20T06:20:31.95Z","Finally! Big Wheels for Steam-Locomtives!","The build is interesting though we believe that one less important part was missing. A lot of SNOT-* and Offset-Know-how went into the locomotive starting from the top headlight.

The best for me as a mechanical engeneer: the steering mechanism is shown correctly. When people try to imitate a locomotive, they move their arms as if the angle between the two sides was 180 degree. But that would leave both cylinders in the dead end at the same time when the engine stops every now & then.
Therefore the angle is only 90 degrees (an extra price for those who can move their arms like this ;-): When one side is in the dead end, the other has the maximum power lever!

Different to cylinders in gas- or dieselengines the steam cylinder work in both directions: one time the piston is pressed back by steam coming in into front part of the cylinder - that is the strong way. Into the other direction the square footage, where the steam can press against the piston, is smaller due to the piston stick. Hence the resulting force is weaker.

Now - if you take all of that into consideration - comes the amazing part: For these reasons a locomotive goes TCHTCHtchtchTCHTCHtchtch - not TCHtchTCHtch

So please: If you move your arms like imitating an angle of 180 degrees, at least do the right noises to it ;-)

I hope this is interesting to anybody but me, but I really felt happy when I saw the angle of only 90 degree clearly depicted in the instructions and remembered all of this again (For the LEGO-locomotive it would have been just the same due to the wonder of electricity or ""the big hand"") - so please respect that technical matter in your own models, too, if you want to build really realistic models.

ALL CREDITS TO THE MAKERS OF THIS, WHO DID NOT FORGET THAT AND MADE A PERFECT STEAM-ENGINE!

By the way: What you see coming out on the top of the steam engine is smoke not steam, as frequently said. Legions of children have been tought the wrong way, I am afraid ;-) The steam cannot be seen on because it is generally invisible. Only at moist wheather you see the condensed water in the air that comes from the steam leaving the cylinders on both sides in rhythmic clouds. ENOUGH mechanical engineering smart-aleck ;-)

The dark green sure is a very elegant colour.
Incredible how that engine goes around the narrow curves of the LEGO train.
But maybe TLC should think about more elegant curves.

And maybe the coaches should be 7 or 8 studs wide in the future. But you get decent tan and brown bricks, which could be the base for a wider coach exclusively behind your own ""Emerald Night"" - which is a small step for mankind but one giant leap for LEGO train(-fans).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"darthdc","2009-08-18T14:40:47.59Z","Most realistic Lego train ever!","For the first time in ages, Lego have come up with a train that has piston rods. Though its nice to see large wheels at last, they still appear small for the loco - they look OK for a 2-10-0 loco which had smaller driving wheels.
The overall look is that of a A1/A3 locomotive like Flying Scotsman, with the ""blinkers"" (smoke deflectors) attached to the front.

The coach is a little too short - maybe they could have used a similar pivoting for the bogies as they did with the small loco wheels. Apart from that, a nice looking coach.

As for the motorisation, the placing of the motor in the cab ruins the effect - it looks better without. The tender needs a few black bricks to pose as coal.

Pros

Nice colour scheme on loco and coach
Stickers applied to individual bricks
Printed bricks

Cons

Coach too short
Needs fireman minifig
Needs a few more coaches (an expansion pack would be nice)
Stickers end up with fingerprints

"David","2010-02-02T18:32:37.123Z","Outstanding - some issues easily resolved","
The purpose of this review is to be helpful to those either planning to purchase or have already purchased this stunning rendition of the Flying Scotsman Locomotive. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flying_Scotsman_in_Doncaster.JPG
It is a bit unfortunate that number 4472 had already been allocated to another set.

A number of problems have been reported with this model, but each has a solution.

Running Gear Lockup:
Quartering - Ensure that the connecting rods are at 90 degrees to each other, not 180 degrees.

Not running smoothly:
Rebuild the cylinders to make them wider. An aesthetically pleasing fix which has been well documented here: http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=37468&hl=emerald+night
and/or
Replace the two 5M thin technic beams (the pushrods connecting the piston rods with the connecting rods) with 7M thin technic beams.

Motorisation issue:
When motorised and under load the bevel gear underneath can slip off its axle, this is remedied by placing a 1x1 technic brick on the axle to block any forward movement of the bevel gear. http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=28273&st=75

"tmdrtn","2009-08-22T14:24:08.047Z","Fantastic set but with some comments","I have ordered this set a soon as it was available (april at S@H),I received the box in mint condition,Lego is very good a packing it's parcels.

Okey so lets start wiht the box;
I like the fact that the box is not glued but sealed with nice tapes that have to be cut with a knife. I am glad with this because it takes allot of effort normally to open a glued box without damaging it. this was quit a challenge with the Hobby Train set and the Holiday train set.

Building;
There is not much to ad from other reviews on this, it is a attractive build,I payed allot of attention to putting the stickers on and am pleased with it. Prints are better off course but it is possible to put them on in a good way.

The models;
Very nice locomotive,I think there are too much moving gears in the inside of the locomotive which are off course needed for the PF motor. I use this train on 9V tracks. the problem with this is that the loco is just giving too much resistance when pulling or pushing. I haven't figured out yet how to solve this in a good way. suggestions are more then welcome. Itis posible to mount the 9V motor under the tender in a good way.
The coach is just fine, I like the door's and hope Lego will release some extra railcars as separate sets.

Very nice model, let's hope Lego will continue bringing out these kind of trainset's I hope they will think more on 9V compatibility.

The gear design on the inside is complex so that you can add a motor later. My only gripe is that sometimes while gliding down the tracks, the gears lock up and the piston wheels stop moving and just slide a to stop without moving. Then the gears pop back into place and it rides again after rolling it back and forth a few times. Unfortunately this gear design and the fact that it does not roll 100% of the time has made me reconsider the purchase of the power functions involved in making the train run. Without buying the deluxe package, the power functions (all 5), are $94. If you can get the gears turning and clicking correctly, then I say buy the power functions, otherwise, the train will lock up and it won't be worth having a motor.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Harm1","2010-03-07T03:49:21.607Z","Very realistic!","Being new to LEGO trains, for me, there are three huge pros to this set:

1. The set looks amazingly realistic when finished. You hardly see it's lego.
2. The selection of parts is amazing, probably the best parts pack for me so far.
3. The box is exactly the right size, not so huge compared to the content, as seems to be getting normal.

Then sadly there are some cons that make the set loose it's fifth star:

- Stickers
- Building instructions seem to be less well thought out then those of, for example, the fire brigade.
- The roof of the passenger part of the train keeps coming of (though this is easily reinforced. 
- Prize difference between euros and dollars.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is it! The Emerald Night is&nbsp;THE best Locomotive so far in LEGO Trains. This engine is probably based off of the A3 series engines from the United Kingdom's LNER. (London &amp; North Eastern Railway) The most famous loco from this class&nbsp;is the Flying Scotsman. (Actually,&nbsp;the Flying Scotsman&nbsp;locomotive was converted from A1 to A3 in January, 1947.) Anyway, this loco looks good, but there are some problems&nbsp;(In my opinion) I want to address here. </p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, the engine does include smoke deflectors. These were only put on in the 1960's, (In the Flying Scotsman's case) so they look a little silly on this engine.</li>
<li>Also, why the need for two head-lights? I think&nbsp;the top one should be removed. </li>
<li>The tender:&nbsp; why the bogies, and the thing in between? It's bothers me some, so&nbsp;I redid&nbsp;the tender to&nbsp;have three&nbsp;axles.</li>
<li>Again with usless stuff... the coach: what's the point? You can only buy them on Brick-Link for at lot of money. I just didn't build my coaches.

I did want to add to anothers comments about the need for suplimental cars or ""addon"" packs where you could buold additional cars to add to the train.  I felt this was enough of a good idea that I eamiled the Lego reps with this suggestion.  Sadly the feedback in summary was no thanks, our company policies disallows suggestions from our customers but have a nice day and thanks for buying.  Talk about a back handed commment.

I understand the whole legal ramifications with copyrights and ownership that would cause a company like Lego to take caution but to simply dispose of an idea because it caem from outside and not within is just not very bright.

I use to do development work for a software company whose development department had this same ""the only good ideas are our ideas"" attitude and it definately hurt the product.

In any event this was fun, what little I got to do, and since Lego is not interested in additional cars I think this would make for a great Open SOurce (in Lego Terms) project for the Lego Masses.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a marvelous set with a great-looking finished product!&nbsp; This build was great.&nbsp; I did feel bad for burying really nice (mainly dark green) pieces within the belly of this beast, never to be seen again, but I know it was all worth it.&nbsp; Here's a quick breakdown of my experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Engine:</strong></p>
<p>This was a lot of fun to put together.&nbsp; I wasn't sure which part of the&nbsp;engine I was building for the first few pages, but as it took shape I could see where I was headed.&nbsp; I had not expected to build a couple of stabalizing pieces that were just used for the initial build, but I was impressed when I realized what they were for.&nbsp; The wheels went together nicely and, for all the issues I've heard they may cause, they look as though they're working fine so far.&nbsp; The finished look of the engine is sleek and classy.&nbsp; Biggest surprise: the front and back wheels which are held to the train by one pin.&nbsp; <em>ONE PIN!</em>&nbsp; I had seen this train run before and now I know why it drives the way it does... <em>ONE PIN!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Tender:</strong></p>
<p>This was a quick build.&nbsp; It is a very simple design with a basic structure.&nbsp; I went together well with no big surprises.&nbsp; Has a sleeker than expected look about it once done which completments the engine very well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Dining Car:</strong></p>
<p>Could not look nicer when done!&nbsp; Again, this went together really easily and somewhat predictably.&nbsp; With a removable roof for access into the interior, the inside design has room enough for six (4 sit, 2 stand) and some nice pieces to boot!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a feeling that had I not picked up this set I would've regretted it down the road.&nbsp; After building it,&nbsp;I am VERY glad that I splurged and bought it.&nbsp; It is a nice addition to <em>ANY</em> collection, regardless if you're a train fan or not.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

(That pun was better, right?)</p><p>You know those huge boxes that have a lot of air in them, where the individual bags shift around inside when you tip it back and forth? This is NOT one of those boxes.

Only one of the three features printing on the torso. However, the Engineer looks like my father in law when he's grumpy (which isn't often) which is funny, because he LOVES trains.</p><p><ul><li><b>Engineer</b> - With the most unique head of the three figures, this one is very cool. Though the torso is plain, it doesn't really bother me as much because of the red bandana accessory, but I'm getting ahead of myself. His black hat (akin to those worn during the American Civil War) is a rather unique piece as well.</li><li><b>Passenger</b> - The tan ponytail hairpiece is the most notable of her features. Other than that, she's pretty standard fare.</li><li><b>Conductor</b> - The only figure to feature torso printing (with the LEGO Train logo emblazoned upon a smart blue jacket), the Conductor is ready to punch your ticket.</li></ul><div>A note: While he may be intended for your airport, your <a href=""/detail/?Set=7567-1"">7567 Traveller</a> will look right at home on board. I'm sure you can find even more appropriate figures, or build your own. It's LEGO, after all.</div></p><h4>Accessories</h4><p>There are a few accessories to mention, although once again - in relation to the 1085 pieces, the four accessories seem a pittance.&nbsp;</p><p><ul><li><b>Shovel</b> - no Engineer is complete without his shovel... unless, I guess, the train he's driving doesn't run on coal.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Bandana</b> - the Engineer needs something to keep that coal exhaust out of his lungs. Here he wears a bandana in order to avoid black lung (or at least delay it).</li><li><b>Suitcase</b> (brown) - our passenger has enough luggage for a month's stay, even though she's just out of town for the weekend! (I'm married - I know how these things go.)</li><li><b>Suitcase</b> (black) - although I'm amazed to see her luggage doesn't match!</li></ul></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>Wow. I mean WOW! The dark green pieces (of which there are a great many) are beautiful to behold - especially the 2x4x2/3 slope bricks decorated with a gold stripe at either end. (18 in all!) The only complaint I might have is the variation in the saturation of the green pieces - some are very dark and others lighter. I don't know if this is normal for the dark green color, but overall it doesn't effect the look of the set unless you inspect thoroughly. Add a heaping helping of other pieces in rare/sought-after colors like reddish-brown, tan and dark brown,&nbsp;as well as a bunch of pearl gold 1x1 round plates and a set of two metallic silver 1x1 round plates (you even get an extra of each one!)&nbsp;and this box overflows with awesomeness. The parts are rounded out by a lot of black, dark bluish gray and light bluish gray pieces.&nbsp;</p><p>Specialty train pieces like the bogie plates, wheels, wheel housings, and magnetic bumpers also add to the value. All in all, 9 bags house the parts. Yes, nine. Eight of them are separated into the modularity of the build, and one houses all the specialty train parts.</p><h4>Build</h4><p>Wow again! I mean double WOW! This build is INTRICATE! Of the bags in the box, most of them are used to build the engine (five in all, each marked with the number 1, to be exact) - and a delightful build it is! A lot of nice parts usage, SNOT techniques (especially around the boiler housing) and cool even/odd stud offsets really inspire the builder. The engine is built to be modular, able to easily accommodate the addition of a power source. I was surprised at first that it didn't include power functions, but realize it would have increased the cost dramatically. It could use the addition of some track, though, otherwise it just looks odd sitting there on a table.&nbsp;</p><p>The tender, the car behind the engine that houses the coal used to fuel the boiler, is a quick breath of fresh air in the middle of the build. Comprised of only one bag (marked with a 2), it goes together in a snap, comparatively, and compliments the engine nicely.</p><p>The passenger carriage, comprised of two bags marked with the number 3, is somewhere in between the two other builds - not as simplistic as the tender, but not nearly as complicated as the engine. Designed with the passenger walkway on one side and two tables with two chairs each on the other side, it looks to be a bar car. Woo! Party on the Emerald Night! There are stickers available with the words 'First', 'Second' and 'Third' to affix to the doors of the car. I guess the idea here is that you can buy/scrounge the parts to build more passenger cars, though I would assume such an endeavor would be costly. It's too bad there aren't service packs available for purchase to allow you to add more cars - especially if they provided enough parts to determine what kind of car you wanted to add, akin to the <a href=""/detail/?set=10022-1"">Santa Fe Car sets</a>. I'm a little confused by the use of dark blue 2x2 round bricks as support for the tables and standard blue for the minifigure seats - it would have added another rare color if the seats were also dark blue.</p><h4>Special Features</h4><p>The engine is set up with gearing to make the wheels turn by merely dropping a PF motor into the boiler compartment (with some structural modifications, detailed at the end of the first instruction booklet). The piston movement of the actuator arms attached to the main wheels is cool, although the technic bars used blend in to the rest of the black pieces that surround them, so it's not very noticeable.&nbsp;</p><p>The engine also features an intricately detailed backhead/firebox (into which the engineer shovels the coal) featuring an opening door and even a plume of flame. This can be removed relatively easily (as it's only held in by a technic rod and a clever hinge plate ""lock"") to be admired. It also needs to be removed completely in order to allow room for a Power Functions motor.</p><p>The passenger car features a removable roof for easy access as well as four hinged doors, one at each corner of the car.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>As someone who is not generally a train enthusiast - LEGO or otherwise - I hadn't given this set much thought in the past.

 initially bought this set just so i could improve the new Hogwarts 
express which i found to be extremely disappointing. However once built i
 decided to kept it as it is, as it is a beautifully detailed model and 
by far the best train set lego has released</span><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText""><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Figures</span></span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">Frankly,
 I'm a bit disappointed that the set only comes with three figures - and
 they're not all that unique to boot. Only one of the three features 
printing on the torso. However, the Engineer looks like my father in law
 when he's grumpy (which isn't often) which is funny, because he LOVES 
trains.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">Engineer
 - With the most unique head of the three figures, this one is very 
cool. Though the torso is plain, it doesn't really bother me as much 
because of the red bandana accessory, but I'm getting ahead of myself. 
His black hat (akin to those worn during the American Civil War) is a 
rather unique piece as well.<br>Passenger - The tan ponytail hairpiece is the most notable of her features. Other than that, she's pretty standard fare.<br>Conductor
 - The only figure to feature torso printing (with the LEGO Train logo 
emblazoned upon a smart blue jacket), the Conductor is ready to punch 
your ticket.<br>A note: While he may be intended for your airport, your 
7567 Traveller will look right at home on board. I'm sure you can find 
even more appropriate figures, or build your own. It's LEGO, after all.</span></div><div style=""font-weight: bold;"" class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText""><br>Accessories</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">There
 are a few accessories to mention, although once again - in relation to 
the 1085 pieces, the four accessories seem a pittance.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">Shovel - no Engineer is complete without his shovel... unless, I guess, the train he's driving doesn't run on coal.<br>Bandana
 - the Engineer needs something to keep that coal exhaust out of his 
lungs. Here he wears a bandana in order to avoid black lung (or at least
 delay it).<br>Suitcase (brown) - our passenger has enough luggage for a
 month's stay, even though she's just out of town for the weekend! (I'm 
married - I know how these things go.)<br>Suitcase (black) - although I'm amazed to see her luggage doesn't match!</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">Parts</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">Wow.
 I mean WOW! The dark green pieces (of which there are a great many) are
 beautiful to behold - especially the 2x4x2/3 slope bricks decorated 
with a gold stripe at either end. (18 in all!) The only complaint I 
might have is the variation in the saturation of the green pieces - some
 are very dark and others lighter. I don't know if this is normal for 
the dark green color, but overall it doesn't effect the look of the set 
unless you inspect thoroughly. Add a heaping helping of other pieces in 
rare/sought-after colors like reddish-brown, tan and dark brown, as well
 as a bunch of pearl gold 1x1 round plates and a set of two metallic 
silver 1x1 round plates (you even get an extra of each one!) and this 
box overflows with awesomeness. The parts are rounded out by a lot of 
black, dark bluish gray and light bluish gray pieces.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">Specialty
 train pieces like the bogie plates, wheels, wheel housings, and 
magnetic bumpers also add to the value. All in all, 9 bags house the 
parts. Yes, nine. Eight of them are separated into the modularity of the
 build, and one houses all the specialty train parts.</span></div><div style=""font-weight: bold;"" class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText""><br>Build</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">Wow
 again! I mean double WOW! This build is INTRICATE! Of the bags in the 
box, most of them are used to build the engine (five in all, each marked
 with the number 1, to be exact) - and a delightful build it is! A lot 
of nice parts usage, SNOT techniques (especially around the boiler 
housing) and cool even/odd stud offsets really inspire the builder. The 
engine is built to be modular, able to easily accommodate the addition 
of a power source. I was surprised at first that it didn't include power
 functions, but realize it would have increased the cost dramatically. 
It could use the addition of some track, though, otherwise it just looks
 odd sitting there on a table.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">The
 tender, the car behind the engine that houses the coal used to fuel the
 boiler, is a quick breath of fresh air in the middle of the build. 
Comprised of only one bag (marked with a 2), it goes together in a snap,
 comparatively, and compliments the engine nicely.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">The
 passenger carriage, comprised of two bags marked with the number 3, is 
somewhere in between the two other builds - not as simplistic as the 
tender, but not nearly as complicated as the engine. Designed with the 
passenger walkway on one side and two tables with two chairs each on the
 other side, it looks to be a bar car. Woo! Party on the Emerald Night! 
There are stickers available with the words 'First', 'Second' and 
'Third' to affix to the doors of the car. I guess the idea here is that 
you can buy/scrounge the parts to build more passenger cars, though I 
would assume such an endeavor would be costly. It's too bad there aren't
 service packs available for purchase to allow you to add more cars - 
especially if they provided enough parts to determine what kind of car 
you wanted to add, akin to the Santa Fe Car sets. I'm a little confused 
by the use of dark blue 2x2 round bricks as support for the tables and 
standard blue for the minifigure seats - it would have added another 
rare color if the seats were also dark blue.</span></div><div style=""font-weight: bold;"" class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText""><br>Special Features</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">The
 engine is set up with gearing to make the wheels turn by merely 
dropping a PF motor into the boiler compartment (with some structural 
modifications, detailed at the end of the first instruction booklet). 
The piston movement of the actuator arms attached to the main wheels is 
cool, although the technic bars used blend in to the rest of the black 
pieces that surround them, so it's not very noticeable.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">The
 engine also features an intricately detailed backhead/firebox (into 
which the engineer shovels the coal) featuring an opening door and even a
 plume of flame. This can be removed relatively easily (as it's only 
held in by a technic rod and a clever hinge plate ""lock"") to be admired.
 It also needs to be removed completely in order to allow room for a 
Power Functions motor.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">The passenger car features a removable roof for easy access as well as four hinged doors, one at each corner of the car.</span></div><div style=""font-weight: bold;"" class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText""><br>Conclusion</span></div><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">As

"xboxtravis7992","2015-12-12T22:13:38.733Z","On route to London...","<p>The Emerald Night is one of the most iconic Lego trains ever produced. Despite several flaws and mistakes, she managed to set a new bar in Lego&#39;s train sets and introduced train fans to the then new Power Functions, official replacing the 9 Volt and RC Train systems which predated it.</p>

<p>Like the Maersk Train, the Horizon Express, the Santa Fe Super Chief, and the BNSF&nbsp;locomotive; the Emerald Night is based on a real train, the famed LNER Class A3 <em>Flying Scotsman</em>. The resemblance to the Flying Scotsman is obvious at a superficial glance, from the green boiler to the &quot;LRTS&quot; on the tender being a sly variation of the &quot;LNER&quot; company which ran the real train. However the Emerald Night doesn&#39;t match the Scotsman %100. The Emerald Night features a large headlight and a cowcatcher, similar to the Scotsman during its tour to North America in 1969. But at the same time, the Emerald Night features &quot;smoke deflectors&quot; (those ear like protrusions around the smoke box), which while use on the real Scotsman, where never used in tandem with the large&nbsp;headlights or the cowcatcher. Despite these inaccuracies, the Night manages to pass as a close Lego approximation of an A3 class locomotive.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Emerald Night is home to a slew of rare and interesting pieces. Lego first introduced their curved 2x4 piece here, with colors in Black, Light Bley, and a Dark Metru Green with gold lines printed on them. Also new to the Night were the large train wheels, four of which came with flanges, and two came &quot;blind&quot; without flanges. Lego continued to produce these curved pieces (with some minor retooling) and the train wheels; and those parts are now common in current sets. The rarest part in the Night was the tan 1x4x3&nbsp;Train windows, which were exclusive to the Emerald Night, and continue to a fetch a high price when resold on Bricklink.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Emerald Night&#39;s three minifigures are rather plain. The locomotive engineer/fireman has a bearded face, a bandana, a black hat, and a torso without any prints. A passenger is included in the form of a woman with blonde hair and a blue torso, again without any prints. The conductor figure is the best in the bunch, with a Lego train&#39;s worker uniform printed on a Dark Metru Blue torso, and legs molded in the elusive Sand Blue color.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The Emerald Night is a very complex, SNOT heavy build. Care must be taken to align the large drive wheels on the locomotive offset from each other, as shown in the instructions. There are several stickers which must be carefully applied, but the model looks better with them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Emerald Night is a fantastic model, but many flaws can be seen on a close inspection. One of the most notable errors is the large size of the boiler. While the method used to build the boiler would have been appropriate&nbsp;to model a large steam engine from North America, the large boiler looks out of place on the British styled Emerald Night; especially since British locomotives are known world wide for their compact and small designs. The tender feels only partially finished, especially with the lack of coal or a wall on the back end to finish all sides of the coal bunker. The inclusion of only one passenger car is unfortunate, since it fails to convey the sense that the Night is pulling a long passenger train. Furthermore, building a set of matching cars is highly expensive, due to the rarity of the window piece. Lastly, the Night&#39;s gear system has been found to be a faulty performer once Power Functions are added, and many Lego fans have had to modify the Night to run smoothly.</p>

<p>With that said, the Night shines in many other aspects. The dark green color is just, stunning! The carriage looks very good. The Night was also Lego&#39;s first train to use the large drive wheels, and as such she shows them off proudly. The large size of the Night has forced Lego to upscale the spacing on latter train sets, basically allowing 8 wide trains to travel Lego rails, an improvement over the constraining six wide gauge of the 9 Volt era. The Night is built very sturdy, mine once took a fall from nearly 7 feet high, and while the outer pieces broke of; the core model frame remained intact allowing for easy reconstruction. Some of the flaws, (such as the tender) are very easily modified; and my Night is currently on display with a full coal bunker. The features such as the smoke deflectors, and the large headlight, can be modified to more closely resemble the real A3 class locomotive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best thing that the Night introduced was the start of a new Lego series, the Advanced Model trains which would include the Maersk Train and the Horizon Express. The Night becomes a wonderful stable mate with those other locomotives. Here is hoping that Lego gives us a fourth Advanced Model Train soon (fingers crossed!)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite some notable flaws, the Night was very successful in introducing Lego fans to a new style of highly detailed train builds.The Emerald Night is a wonderful locomtive, and is a great introduction to Lego&#39;s train themes.</p>
