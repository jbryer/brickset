In my opinion...well, maybe.  Let's explore why and why not.

First off, this is a huge set.  Around 1750 pieces, this is definitely one of the largest ""Star Wars"" sets, only eclipsed by the UCS Millenium Falcon (10179) and Death Star (10188).  However, if you were to combine the prices of the AT-TE walker (7675) and the Republic Gunship (7676), you would have around a $210 set with a total of 1830 pieces.  So all in all, this set is more expensive for fewer pieces when compared to two other comprable sets.

I was able to build the whole thing in one focused evening, but you could easily divide up that time as the build is split up between the walker and the Dropship.  Since the build is split up between the walker and ship, the bags of pieces are divided so you can easily have out all the neccessary pieces for the specific model.  This makes it alot easier to search through all of those pieces.  The build itself is pretty good, but familiar if you have the afore mentioned AT-TE and Gunship.  These are pretty much the same design, just modified a bit.

Let's review the AT-OT first since it is kind of the star of the set, in my opinion.  I think it's a good model and representation.  There are 16 seats to transport an entire army of clones.  Near the rear of the vehicles is a boarding ramp and at the front is a cool cockpit to seat your clone pilot.  Eight movable legs move this juggernaut across the battle field, and a handy carrying handle sprouts up from the center for easy transportation back and forth from you shelve to the floor.

The Dropship is quite big when compared to its cousin, the Gunship.  There is a single cockpit to seat your other clone pilot and three laser cannons to provide covering fire for your newly deployed troop transport.  It also sports two wing mounted missile launchers that fire 4 flick fire missiles simualtaneously.  There is a nice little cargo bay beneath the cockpit to store eight more flick-fire missiles.  The main attraction is the clamping mechanism that allows it to carry your AT-OT into battle.  It is a well designed device that clips onto the carrying handle of the walker.  It works pretty well and actually works with the AT-TE, if you modify that set's carrying handle.

Some people have wondered why they did not just release these two as seperate models.  I would argue the reason for not doing that is that alone, these two models are a bit unspectacular.  They are good models, but the features they have are a bit limited.  But when you combine the two, you have a really spectacular set.  Not to mention the dropship is compatible with previous sets and the $250 price tag is looking a bit more reasonable.  Add in the 8 minifigs (6 troopers, 2 pilots) and you will probably not regret forking over the cash.  Just looking at this beast combined on my kitchen table really screams a $250 price tag.  

I would recommend this set whole-heartedly for those that ""desperately"" want it.  For those that cannot justify the hefty price tag, if you have the Gunship and AT-TE, you basically already have this set.  But the ability to transport your massive war machines through the air is pretty cool.  And to be able to move around 16 clone troopers at a time is pretty impressive.

The only complaint I have is that the Seperatists don't have much to counter this massive new set.  Yeah, they have the huge Federation MTT, but when you combine the might of this set, the Gunship, the AT-TE, the Assault Shuttle, the Fighter Tank, and the V-19 Torrent, the ""clankers"" are a bit outclassed.  Oh well.  

Pros:  Huge set with tons of play potential.
          8 minifigs for building up your huge Clone Army
          Looks impressive sitting on your shelf
          Flying your AT-OT around is pretty sweet
          Well designed and sturdy

Cons:  The models by themselves are a bit ""lackluster"", definitely benefit from              each other
           No unique minifigs, all clones and pilots
           Loading ramp on the AT-OT is at a steep angle, your troopers would    tumble down it if they were in a hurry to disembark
           Nearly unjustifiable $250 price tag

"arctrooper170","2009-03-27T11:36:09.513Z","Bring the battle for Geonosis home!","This is it, the best clone wars set ever! first off both sets are huge, both bigger then their predecessors (the AT-TE and Republic Gunship) and are just as detailed. 

AT-OT: The walker is the first thing you build when open the set, it is the first booklet. The body design is similar to the AT-TE in a small way, but completly different at the end. There is enough room for a whole platoon of clones to fit inside(and it comes with about half) The legs are poseably but yet sturdy and no rubber bands. The forward guns have a cool design, and the rear guns are bubbled. The cockpit is just really fun to open, opening in 3 positions and keeping the actual design from the movie. The gun turrets are great ways to store the guns and when fully together the walker is pretty hefty.

Republic Dropship: The dropship is way bigger then expected and takes up the other 2 instruction booklets. The overall way it is put together is so clever and creative. The detail is just astounding even though some of it comes from the dreded stickers. The storage compartment doesnt have a mini command station but a missile rack holding 8 extra missiles along with the 8 that are located on the wings. The landing gear/carrier mechanism is very supportive and can hold the dropship with ease. The handle at first glance looks unsupportive and will drop the ship, but a few pieces can hold up really well and you shouldnt worry that the ship and walker (if connected) will fall. (unless the walker's not hooked up right) It picks up the AT-OT and AT-TE easily and an ingenious design on how it works (a pain to build though)

I recommend saving up money for the massive set if you are a collector or someone who likes a good challenging build, yes the price is a little steep but once you hold the dropshop carring the AT-OT you know it is worth it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lego_Master422","2009-04-23T20:20:45.513Z","THE Must Have Set of 2009!!","I just got this set for my birthday, and  must say it is one of the most impressive sets I've ever had the pleasure of building. The build took a solid 4 hours, however, it was worth every minute of it. There are some very advanced and difficult building techniques, especially in the Dropship, so it is would be wise to pay relatively close attention to the suggested age category. When held by the handle, the Dropship without the AT-OT attached is slightly off balance. However, once the AT-OT is attached, the combined vehicle is perfectly balanced. The ""two"" sets definitely compliment each other and when you have this set in your hand you'll forget all about the somewhat steep price. Now lets get to the pros and cons.

PROS-
- MASSIVE set
- Two sets in one
- Clone army builder
- Satisfying build
- Exclusive
- New pieces
- Great playability

CONS-
- Steep price
- AT-OT's connecting piece to the Dropship falls down by design when released (for those who already have this set; this can be fixed by placing an extra technic piece in one of the lower holes)
- Stickers
- The AT-OT's legs can be a pain to pose

In conclusion, this is a great set and well worth the steep price. If you're on the fence about buying it... GO FOR IT! you won't regret it! I'd say that this is now my favorite set and it is undoubtedly the BEST set of the year!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lumix","2009-04-01T14:01:26.2Z","Impressive. Most impressive.","I have made a complete, very detailed review here:
http://www.hispalug.com/foro/index.php?topic=6822.0

It features many photos of the building, the finished model and also animated GIFs that properly show the model's functionality. I have both recorded and included some videos as well as some photos comparing real model vs lego model. I hope you like it.

This set is just amazing, not only because it's big and exclusive, but because it's really excellent, if you can live with the expensive price. 250â‚¬ in Europe makes a 0.141 price to pieces ratio, not very good, but oh, well... let's go into the set...

The building itself is lengthy (1758 pieces) and very pleasant. There are lots of small pieces, normal bricks, wedges, slopes and Technic bricks... sometimes it's like you are building a Technic set, instead of a Star Wars one. I love Technic, so that's OK for me.

The AT-OT is as big as it's AT-TE cousin. It's open because it was designed for transport, not for direct combat. It is very sturdy and has decent playability: you can unfold the back ramp, sit the clones, pose the legs, rotate back turrets, lift front cannons and open the sides of the cockpit sideways and the front pane forward. Although it has some exposed areas in the hull, it's an imposing vehicle, as you can see here:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10195/p1020585.jpg

The LAAT/c is a really big, beautifully designed ship. It is much bigger than it looks in pictures, sturdy for the most part, and it is pretty swoosheable given its huge size. The model is very accurate as you can see in a comparison photo:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10195/LAATc/p1020698.jpg

The LAAT/c can be swooshed around taking it by the upper extensible handle, or holding from underneath. However, When the AT-OT is attached, swooshability reduces. The LAAT/c has moderate playability, less than its counterpart 7676 because of the carrying mechanism. You can open the cockpit, open the sides of it to reveal a hidden missile rack, shoot the flick-missiles with a well-designed mechanism that launches four missiles at the same time and, of course, attach a vehicle AT-OT, AT-TE or even some other vehicles, like an AT-AT. You can see a LAAT/c carrying an AT-AT in one of my photos here:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10195/LAATc/p1020718.jpg

The AT-OT and LAAT/c are good models on their own (not top-notch, but good), but when this set really shines is when the LAAT/c is carrying the AT-OT (or other vehicle). It makes a HUGE set that begs to be shown and to play with it:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10195/p1020587.jpg

The AT-OT fits nicely when attached to the LAAT/c and it's quite stable. I've made some animated photos in the review to explain how the attach mechanism work. Please read my fully detailed review so that you can make yourself an idea of how big and awesome this set really is. You can see the complete photo gallery here:
http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=375278

PROS
- Very big!
- Decent playability.
- Amazing design, very much like the ""real"" model.
- Exclusive set.
- Many pieces.
- Cool attach mechanism.
- LAAT/c can carry many vehicles apart from AT-OT.
- 2 vehicles in one set.

CONS
- High price.
- Could use some more clone minifigs or at least an exlusive minifig, given this set's price tag.
- Could also use some printed pieces instead of stickers!

If it weren't for the high price, this set would get five stars hands down. If you are thinking about buying this set, just go ahead, it's simply amazing, very big and impressive. Highly recommended.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Starstreak","2009-03-31T01:50:56.25Z","A must for any Lego Star Wars Fan","I did a full review here:
http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=27187
Full of pictures of build and final photos.  I hope you like it.

Features
This whole frakkin thing is a feature! Ignoring the outrageous price, you get two large sets and they join! Plus either by pure luck or thinking ahead, the Dropship can join with the newer AT-TE. 
For the Dropship:
There's a missile rack that holds 8 spare flick fire missiles, which stores in the storage bay below the cockpit. 
Speaking of the storage area, it's behind the Wompa sticker. And the storage doors opens on both sides. Same as the newer Gunship. 
There's also a rear door that lowers. I thought it would allow access to the AT-OP, but it doesn't.
All guns move on the ball.
The cockpit opens.
There are 2 sets of 4 flick fire missiles that really shoot 4 at a time if you hit the technic poll behind them.
The top of the Dropship lifts so you can use it as a handle.
As for the AT-OP
All legs move to some degree. It seems every single AT-TE and now this AT-OP uses a different leg system. The first AT-TE was ratcheted, good for posing, but fell apart easy. The newer AT-TE used rubber bands to spring the legs to the position it should be in. And this one, while doesn't use ratcheting, it's free movement but doesn't fall apart as easy.
The side armor and ""wings"" move a little to give angle.
There's a rear ramp that unfolds.
The front cockpit window opens forward and the two side windows pivot open.
The cockpit and main guns pivot up wards for extraction with the Dropship.
There are handguns and rifles that are mounted on the side armor.
Enough chairs 16 troopers

Issues
I'm ignoring the price. Lego choose to make it that much. Nothing we say will change that. Either the set sells well and holds value, or eventually it'll drop in price, which I doubt.
There is nothing wrong with this unit. Go buy my extra box.  Ok, just kidding. For starters I think this set should've came with 10 troopers and 2 pilots. Maybe one Jedi for good measure for the price. 
The minifigs don't like to ""sit"". They pop off too easy of the chairs. 
The position of the handle isn't on the balance point, so the weight feels uneven when holding.
The neck of the Dropship IS flimsy. The neck armor will come part where you have to pinch it back. 
Putting the cockpit on gave me trouble. But I think it felt harder than it really was. All you have to do is make sure its straight and push it on.
The locking mechanism seems flimsy. But that's only because it's made out of plastic. I'm sure if it was metal poles, it wouldn't look like it was going to snap. Don't worry, it sounded worse than it really is.
No extra guns for the minifigs. You have to pull off the guns from the weapon mounts.
The stickers are normally hard to put on. But not this time. Most of the stickers are big pieces. Just take your time at putting the stickers on. I too wish the window stickers was painted and not a sticker.

Final Thoughts
Sorry if this review took a while to finish. I did try to rush and finish it for the forum members. I hope it was worth the wait. You could say this is more a build review than just a review as I included many pictures of the build process. I figured many people wouldn't get the chance to buy an exspensive piece of Lego, so at least you can see how it was made.
I think at this point, I spent about 4+ hours in editing the pictures and about 2+ in trying to organize the review for posting. 
I hope you had as much fun reading this review as I had in making it.  


My Rating
Playability: 4 out of 5. My 7 year old son proved it can be played with. Mind you he did break a few loose parts off, but easily fixed. Remember, this set was for 14+ years old. Haha.
Design: 4 out of 5. Why so high? It's in line with other SW sets. Not realistic, yet enough details to keep you happy. 
Build experience: 3 out of 5. Three is the complexity of the build. Not too hard, but there is alot of pieces so I can see some younger kids like 9 year olds saying it takes too long to build.
Overall: 4 of 5. Why again so high? You gotta love Star Wars and Lego. If not, you wouldn't even consider paying this kind of money. So it's worth it.

pros

both vehichles aare very big
the at-ot has 8 legs
number of clones (also a con)
the at-ot cocpit opens in 3 directions
there a ramp at the back of the at-ot
the drop ship can launch 4 misles at once
there are extra misles
the handle on the drop ship
the clones driving both vehichles are pilots

cons 
the legs arent ruber banded (not that bad but when the drop ship drops it of, you have to put all the legs as they were again)
if the drop ship doent connect the first time, dont pick it up or it might fall of
number of clones

overall this set is great and you should try to get it

2. i dont know how to fit the at-te on the drop ship id it just me or is it others having trobles with this also.

"P13c30fch33s3","2009-06-18T07:33:59.577Z","Great, but expensive","I have realised that my previous reviews were not particularly helpful, so I'll try and make them better.

Just so you know, this review will be long, so if you can't be bothered to read, skip to the bottom. There will be a pros and cons bit.

First of all, the price for this set is way too high for what you get. Sure, it has 8 Clones (6 normal and 2 pilots) but they can be found in several other sets, rendering this set's use as a unique minifig accumalator useless. It is too expensive to be a 'Build Your Army"" set because no 'normal' person would pay 400 AUD for this set just for the minifgs.

The piece number in this set is very low compared to what it should be. Many sets, when added together often cost a lot less and still have more pieces.
E.g: Corporate Alliance Tank Droid (Price 40 AUD)
Pieces per set: 216
Number of sets that can be bought by 400 AUD: 10
216 * 10 = 2060 pieces (40 minifigs)
while
AT-OT + Republic Dropship
Pieces per set: 1758
Number of sets that can be bought by 400 AUD: 1
1758 * 1 = 1758 pieces (8 minifigs)

You can see, by this little bit of maths, that the AT-OT has way too few pieces for its price.

Next annoying point, there are SO MANY STICKERS! Several of them are large ones and can be tedious to put on. Advice: Leave the stickers for the nose of the dropship. It takes a lot of effort (for me) to put them in the right position and it is always slanted no matter what I do! (that's probably just me but my point is the stickers)

However, this set is not all gloom. For one thing, the firing mechanism in the wing works very well and launches all four rockets at once if: a) built correctly and b) pushed correctly. Another thing, The small missile rack inside the nose of the Dropship is a nice addition. Although it is not as good as the command centre in the Gunship (7679...I think), it is more appropriate for the Dropship than a command centre.

The Dropship is quite big, and is bigger than the Gunship. It consists of a dense technic frame in the middle, surrounded by standard bricks clipped on the outside. The clip that holds the AT-OT (and AT-TE) is annoying to reset but is rock steady and will not break unless it is not properly prepared/built.
PLEASE NOTE: The AT-TE will only clip if the handle is altered slightly. Move the little round cylinders from the top hole one hole down. This opens the top hole for the clip. The handle on the dropship is very good and is very steady, although it makes the Dropship unbalanced. Well size and designed for human hands.

The AT-OT has 16 seats. 16! This amount of seats can easily hold your Clone collection (unless you happen to have every set every created...) in it. The six guns meant for the six given clones are mounted on simple but effective gun mounts. Unfortunately, the clones who sit in the front six seats cannot be armed otherwise the clip-preparation will not work properly. (The cockpit must swing up) The handle on the AT-OT is small but effective. It requires the right technique, but is very, very steady.

The cockpit of the AT-OT is very neat and the three transparent pieces fold outwards very neatly, allowing the pilot to get out of the AT-OT. The cockpit in the Dropship is not quite so great. It is very similar (perhaps the same) to the Gunship and the cockpit piece sometimes comes off when you try to close/open it. The ramp on the back of the AT-OT is very steep when deployed. No one could run down there without tripping and landing on their bottom, face, shoulder or head.

Pros:
6 Clones - great for boosting your clone collection
Unique - has not been made before
Flick fire missiles - Firing mechanisms are good and work
 - Missile rack inside is neat and appropriate
Large - The dropship is bigger than the gunship
Handles - Work very well

Cons:
Low Price to Piece ratio compared to other (multiplied) sets
Can be made from (heavily) modified AT-TE and Gunship
No unique minifigs
AT-OT looks empty from front
Ramp on back of AT-OT is too steep

Overall:
A good set if you have the money, but ignore this if you are not a fan of Star Wars; it will be a waste of time and money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-12-24T11:23:11.593Z","Giant... And heavy.","Double reviews starting with the AT-OT.
It's basically a larger version of the AT-TE. Only now it has 8 legs instead of 6. Speaking of the legs, they are very floppy. They aren't hinged, but instead they are held by pins. The legs could also use some armor in the middle section. This lack of armor also makes it easy for peices to come off. The Walker also has a boarding ramp, but it's more of a slide. The angle is to steep for the ramp and just looks silly when the clones are coming on. It still is steep even if you make the walker as ow as it can go. There's not much detail on the armor. Though the armor isn't that visible, I'd still like to see a little detail. The armor also has 6 guns (3 on each side) which can be taken off for the clones. But the clones themselves don't have seperated guns. Inside are some seats (I can't remember the exact number, but it's around 15) which can hold a small squad of clones. Cannons are also positioned 2 in the front and 2 in the back. The cockpit can also open very nicely. The sides split and the top comes up. What I don't like in that the clone can't sit and stay. There are no studs; instead, he sits on a 2x2 plate. The connection mechanism is also locaed in the middle which doesn't really look that awkward.
The Dropship (or LAAT/c) is very well constructed. It has technic parts in the body to keep it held together. I would have also liked it if there was some more armor in the mid section or detail. It looks kinda plain in persone. The head is prety much hollow. inside it holds 8 spare missles. The cockpit isn't much, but there are studs to keep the pilot in. There's not much in the top, but it does feature the handle which you can use to ""fly"" the ship. Not much to the wings either. There are four missles on each which all fire at once when you push the back of the firing mechanism. I personally would like it if they fired individually. And there's also the engines which aren't anything spectacular. Going back to the head, there are interchangeable stickers for the ones on the sides. You have to actually take the sticker off to put the other one on. I hoped they'd include 2 extras of the peices so one could swap the parts. So make sure you put on the one you like best.
The real fun of the model comes with their combine feature. Here's a list:
1. Lift the shaft on the AT-OT. There's a piece that'll keep it up.
2. Lower the Dropship on the shaft.
3. Pull the yellow piece on the Dropship. An axle will fall down then.
4.Have the shaft push the axle up. Then push the yellow piece into the hole on the shaft.
And that's it. You're ready for takeoff. It kinda makes me nervous that it only connects by one piece, but it's strong. When it's combined this thing is not only massive, it's heavy. But it's a great feature for it. You can also combine it with the Clone Wars AT-TE, I believe, but I don't have that set.
Overall, great. Well worth the money, I'd say. If you find it on sale, even better. Definately get it when you have the chance and money.    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

For the price (that I know was paid) it is pretty damn cool. Both models are quite large and go together quite well. The dropship can be get tricky, mainly in trying to hold all of the various sections together for joining.

All told, it took me about 4-5 hours to build both models, with a small break in between to have lunch. The kit(s) come in separate bags (the bags marked '1' or for the AT-OT, the bags marked '2' are for the dropship). All said and done, there was a small hand full of tiny left-overs. Not all that useful on their own, but they are the kind of part that likes to go missing from time to time. There was nothing overly hard about the building, besides the 'juggling' issues I had trying to join up certain section of the dropship.

While I am probably to old (if you ever really can be) to be playing with toys, I can see kids having fun with this set. I don't really like the legs on the AT-OT, they look cool, but the just seem to flop about. I would have preferred a lot more friction the joints to make it easier to pose. As a result of their 'floppy' nature, you cannot really walk it...more you simply pick the whole lot up and move it. Other people have also complained about the seating being cramped. I am not seeing the problem, you can seat the mini-figs in. They are Well packed in, but if anyone has actually ridden in any kind of armoured military transport...you will know that space is a luxury that is non-existent.

The drop ship is less of a problem. While I really don't like the idea of the rubber bands acting as a spring for the rear landing legs (mainly because they will perish and snap in time), the system does work surprisingly well. I am not sure what problems other people are having with the front ball mount guns on the dropship, they feel VERY secure and, on my model at least, actually need a good deal of effort to pull apart.

My biggest concern is the locking system for hooking the AT-OT to the underside of the dropship. While it works, the lock and the fold-out handle on top feel rather flimsy. They work, I just don't know how much I trust them.

1. Fantastic scale and proportions, everything is the right size 
2. Carrying handle for the gunship 
3. Comes with six clones!  
4. Movable guns and opening cockpit on both the gunship and walker
5. Walker has fold-out ramp to load and deploy clones 
6. Comes with two pilots
7. Walker has a massive amount of seats 
8. Gunship can pick up the AT-TE as well as the AT-OT 
9. Walker has sturdy construction 
10. Overall a really cool set, and one that really makes play real because you can physically deploy walkers onto the battle front.  

Cons: 
1. Guns for clones attach to the walker but jiggle around.  They never line up strait!  A stupid con, but, now you know.  
2. Guns on the front of the gunship fall off sometimes if they are hid hard enough 
3. Cockpit to walker breaks a lot when you open and close it 
4. The part of the gunship leading up from the cockpit to the wings is weak and cannot support the weight of the walkers for extended periods.  It will crack but not break, so it's essential you keep an eye out and tighten it up before every flight with a walker.  
5. Nothing else, and these are picky cons, the pros far outweigh them.    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Hylocera","2010-01-30T16:17:17.403Z","I love it I love it, and I LOVE IT!","I got this set a while ago with my brother for $249.99, which I consider slightly ridiculous. I thought it should be $199.99 for its small quantity of pieces (1758). Pros/Cons coming up.

Pros
Alot of Clone Troopers! (6 troopers, 2 pilots)
A nice challenge
I haven't gotten a $50+ set in a long time (Actually, this is my second)
16 flick-fire missiles!
Nice attachment system. I didnt know before that the stopper that came in front of the technic bar that linked to the AT-OT was automatic before
A great cockpit piece on the AT-OT
Great cargo space in the LAAT/C
Handle that can be ""stored""

Cons
The LAAT/C is unstable on the landing gear, and acts kind of like a seesaw
The gun holders on the sides of the AT-OT allow the guns to jiggle around
AT-OT front window ALWAYS breaks off if you open it to quickly
No minifigures can sit down in the green chairs with the LAAT/C attached

Overall, a sweet set with lots of great pieces. 5/5 Shrimpmaker over and out.

Well all of the fans who actually believed that it would, like on the back of the second booklet on the ATTE, it doesn't, don't wate your money only for the locking thing. But otherwise, it was an amazing set. It had two pilots, and six other clone troopers. This set is very big, I was excpecting it to be small, but it came with a gigantic walker and ship.

"Fellointer","2010-06-13T16:55:58.093Z","A simply massive set","<p>Despite having first read several reviews, complete with pictures and even videos, only a live viewing of this set has&nbsp;truly&nbsp;impressed upon me its scale. The AT-OT sizes up pretty closely with the AT-TE, and in that regard it would have been a large, $100+ set itself. But the Republic Dropship embarrasses its Gunship counterpart, as it boasts a significantly larger wingspan and length. Its heavy&nbsp;reliance on long technic pieces provides this increase length, despite the fact that both ships consist of&nbsp;approximately&nbsp;the same number of parts&nbsp;(the Gunship has more of a substantial underbelly, apt because its inside permits the&nbsp;transport&nbsp;of troops, whereas the Dropship's empty underside allows it to hold an entire ship). The combined weight is impressive, almost too much for young children, and enough at least to make my arms sore after only a minute or so.&nbsp;	The bags, thank goodness, were labeled 1 and 2, so that my table was not cluttered with all 1758 pieces at once. I think, however, that LEGO would have done better still to have 4 distinctions rather than 2, as it might have facilitated the process even more (it seems, for whatever reason, that Star Wars bags are numbered far less frequently than an other theme's).&nbsp;</p><p>The build of the AT-OT was not overly complex, although at times some of the technic components might have posed a challenge for younger builders. And as the vehicle walks on eight legs, there was some unavoidable repetition. During the build I never really grasped the&nbsp;entirety&nbsp;of the ship, and at the end I had a repressed feeling that its fully open topside lacked something in the way of substance. I was positively surprised, however, by the elegance of the retracting cockpit and some of the other components that folded neatly and maintained an&nbsp;aesthetic&nbsp;appeal.</p><p>The Dropship presented as the far more difficult build. It was perhaps the most complex of the 200+ sets I have encountered in my life, and by no means an easy task for a child. Luckily I never misstepped in the largely technic build, for, if I had, it would have meant a half hour of backtracking and some complex repairs. Be sure to pay very close attention during this build, because I might have easily&nbsp;succumbed&nbsp;to frustration had I committed even a single error. About three or four times during the build I had to connect large,&nbsp;separate&nbsp;sections together, and twice it took a good ten minutes to&nbsp;decifer&nbsp;the instructions and position the technic holes just right. Any early mistake would have proved devastating. But the end result appears as seemingly more based in system than technic pieces, something I was highly impressed with. It is sturdy and, again,&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;massive.&nbsp;	</p><p>As for playability, few Star Wars sets, and even LEGO sets for that matter, offer more depth than this combination. Obviously, the Dropship can latch on to the AT-OT and carry it away, and the connection is strong enough so that I trust neither ship will crash into the ground upon my picking them up (it should be noted, however, that it took some time to figure out exactly how to attach the two, and I modified the connection&nbsp;somewhat&nbsp;to increase stability). The 'flickfire' missiles on the Dropship are not actually flickfire, much to my approval, and they travel pretty speedily upon the push of a button. The inclusion of six clone&nbsp;troopers&nbsp;and two as of now quite rare clone pilots is certainly a bonus, although, I must confess, does not seem enough now that I realize the size of these ships. There are significantly more seats in the AT-OT than the provided troops can fill.&nbsp;	</p><p>The price per piece ratio is&nbsp;horrendous&nbsp;at a mere 14.22 cents/piece. I happened to pick my set up during a 25% LEGO Shop at Home sale, which reduced the ratio to 10.666 cents/piece, still below the modest standard of 10 cents/piece. Even though this set impresses me like few others, and is certainly in my top 5&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;of all Star Wars sets, I would never purchase it at the full price.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,1
"starwarsman52","2010-11-15T19:36:34.577Z","By far my favorite vehicles, EVER!","This set is absolutely massive! It is a truly incredible set. Although the set is fantastic, the price is not. Since money doesn't grow on trees, I had to save up lots of money for this set. But if you REALLY want it, then you should definitely go for it. Ill start with the AT-OT.<br><br>The at-ot walker is a huge and very cool vehicle. It also goes very nicely with the at-te walker. Building this set was relatively easy. An average 9 to 10 year old builder could build it with ease. The cockpit on the vehicle looks very cool with the stickers that are on it. It opens up 3 different ways. the at-ot has 16 different seats in the main cabin which allows you do seat much of your clone army. On the armour plating itself there are holes where you can put your clones guns to act as turrets. Another great thing about this set is that the legs have no rubber bands on them so you can position them in any walking position you like. In the back of the vehicle there is a very cool boarding ramp that clones can go up and down on. Some people have said it looks to steep, but once you connect your clones on to it it look very cool. Getting the walker into takeoff position is a very easy 3 step procedure. The first 2 steps are you have to fold up the cockpit and the holder on top of it. The 3rd step is you have to take out the stick that allows you to carry the vehicle and you flip up a little yellow piece. Put the yellow piece in the correct technic hole on the stick to hold it up, and your ready to go. <br><br><ul><li>AT-OT</li><li>Pros:</li><li>lots of seats</li><li>cool cockpit</li><li>cool boarding ramp</li><li>walkable legs</li></ul><ul><li>Cons:</li><li>cockpit doors occasionally break off</li></ul><br>Now the dropship. The dropship was a more difficult build but a fun challenge. I am only 12 and this set is labeled for 14 year olds. Since it seemed it would be a tough build I decided to go to Lego.com and look at the building instructions for the set before I started building it. I very carefully looked over every part of the ship that looked confusing and after a little bit of time, I finally understood all of it. I highly suggest doing this for anyone who does not feel 100% prepared to build it. All you have to do is go to lego.com, scroll to the bottom of the homepage, click on customer service, click building instructions and type in dropship and at-ot. Now on to the real review. This ship is massive. It is a good portion bigger than the gunship. You get many cool weapon features with this set. Two laser ball turrets in the front, what I like to think of has ""flamethrowers"" on the side, 4 flick missiles on each wing, plus inside the compartment under the cockpit there are a additional 8 flick missiles. The mechanism to hold the walker is pretty easy to maneuver once you realize how it works.<br><ul><li>Pros:</li></ul><img src=""file:///C:/DOCUME%7E1/HP_ADM%7E1/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/moz-screenshot.png"" alt=""""><ul><li>cool weapons</li><li>easy to use</li></ul><ul><li>fun challenge </li></ul><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3

"gorf43","2021-12-28T04:44:58.237Z","They say not to meet your heroes... ","<p>...And that unfortunately holds true with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ever since I started collecting SW sets, this was the one to get. And I finally got it. And Im disappointed. It hasn&#39;t aged well...&nbsp;</p>

<p>First off, I cant help but feel let down about spending so much on an AT OT. Its a boring vehicle in the SW galaxy, and its even more boring in this one. It feels thrown together. Its a big platform with seats, a rudimentary cockpit, eight legs, and a truly awful rear ramp. Its not a cool walker. Its no AT AT or AT TE, its basically the SW equivalent of a&nbsp;minivan.&nbsp;The side panels just clip on, the floor is just an ugly mess with seats (nice green ones, actually super cool) tossed in and some form of cockpit thing. It has to fold to be picked up, which causes it to have massive gaps and leaves it looking a bit four plus. The ramp is way too steep when lowered and it just kinda folds up right on the back of the AT OT, taking up space. The legs are fine, but theres just a lot lol. Not a good build and even worse when you consider its major&nbsp;absence from most SW content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Dropship is definitely where things get interesting. Its the cool one and has the ability to pick up both this and the previous(?) years AT TE. But. BUT. Its not a good build either. If you want to put this on display or in a MOC, it will need modified. There are dozens of mismatched, random coloured pieces scattered throughout. One example: In a big section of white bricks, there is a cluster of 1x4 light grey, 1x6 dark grey, and a 1x1 round tan piece. Completely illogical and the whole thing has this weird coloring. The wings are just massive stacked plates with one stud offsets to create a narrower wing, the top of the spine uses unnecessary&nbsp;angled pieces allowing you to see right inside, and theres a strange &quot;pod&quot; attached to the handle which looks a bit out of place. Its a good model, and solid, but it has aged badly, honestly not worth the price. Ive done some extensive modifications to tile off the entire top of the spine, bulk up the tiny (possibly accurate I don&#39;t know) engines, and replace all the stupid mismatched colors. I have a feeling that some pieces weren&#39;t available in white so Lego used tan instead. It doesn&#39;t work. It goes wrong and draws your attention to those pieces and you think: &quot;Ha, they&#39;re trying to substitute tan for white!&quot; So in the end, they need changed. The lifting arms that carry the walkers (in universe) look tiny and weak. More tiling beefs them up and makes them look like they could actually lift a massive AT TE. But, once you&#39;ve fixed it, its brilliant. The nose art options are pure genius and look amazing, the exposed cables add some extra detail, and thats about it. You need to fix it yourself, but once you have, it has the potential to be the coolest model in your collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heres the thing though, This was NOT a good deal. And not the usual second hand Lego prices bad, it was REALLY bad. In fact, I don&#39;t recommend buying this set.&nbsp;If you&#39;re simply a collector and want if for what it is, sure. But for anyone else, don&#39;t buy it, you will be disappointed. First, you&#39;re paying half for a bad AT OT. Do you really want an AT OT in your collection? I quickly found out that I didnt. Second, if you want the Dropship, it doesn&#39;t look good. It actually looks awful and if you want to put it&nbsp;in a MOC, be prepared to possibly order pieces. So I recommend buying ONLY the Dropship and if you want something to go with it, you could more wisely spend your money on the previous years AT TE, a good build. Or if you don&#39;t want to actually pick one up and fly it around, the one from 2013 is even better. So thats it, a review on a sadly disappointing set. (The whole set is still super cool, comes with lots of P1 clones, and its honestly really fun to pick up and fly the AT OT around. But only if you&#39;ve got money to spare! Number one set that deserves the UCS treatment!) Thanks for reading!&nbsp;</p>
