"Odeinoichus","2016-08-01T23:00:47.623Z","Disapointing Lizard.","<p><strong>Set #7804 Lizard: </strong>Another animal in LEGO form from a Creator Polybag, released in 2009 this set was made available with the Daily Mail in the UK, if it was released outside of the UK I&rsquo;m not sure of, but recently I managed to add it to my collection through a local seller. Is this set worth picking up? Read on to find out.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Design of model impresses in capturing the likeness of a lizard.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Green plates and some bricks used in build makes this a decent parts pack for green parts.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model is thin and not very bulky. Also could benefit from SNOT techniques.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Piece count also suffers. May have benefited from a few extra parts for the tail to make the model slightly longer.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to say sometimes if a Polybag is worth tracking down years after missing the first opportunity to get it. I think in the case of this particular Polybag it isn&rsquo;t really worth that extra mile, if you happen to stumble across it you might find an interest in it, especially if you are a fan of Creator based sets. The animal design is limited in this small scale so unless you are a huge fan you may not like it. Especially as none of these sets include Minifigures.</p>

<p>You can safely skip this one, you definitely won&rsquo;t miss much for not picking it up.</p>
