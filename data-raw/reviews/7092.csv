"absolutelylez","2010-01-04T16:32:30.2Z","Horrible Shark","The pieces are useful, but to be honest, this model is painfully ugly, and hardly accurate. I think a small shark could have been made far better with different pieces, curves and better hinges. Of course this is only a promotional set so it would not be using more expensive pieces.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

<p>Pros: Nice tail,</p>
<p>Cool eyes,</p>
<p>good colours.</p>

<p>Cons: Should be more accurate,</p>
<p>Should have proper teeth pieces.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,4,3

I actually picked these up because of the old gray/ grey combo and because of the hinges. The set is not playable, yet from a few angles it actually looks good. I personally really befaned these plastic bag sets. Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for decently priced brickbank boosters.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Cheers LEGO!&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,3,2,5
