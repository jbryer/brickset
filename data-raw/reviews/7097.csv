It's ok if you are happy with rough estimate cooking, but it is a long way from precise.&nbsp; <br><br>When weight is added to the bowl a red line moves down a very small display window (0-1000g [50g steps] / 0-33 oz [2 oz steps]) on the side.&nbsp; If you want to reset to zero with weight already applied (ie to add more ingredients) then you move the actual display up and down with a very small knob and if you are lucky the scale will move to where you want it, and if you are extra lucky it will stay there (it's not very 'sticky').&nbsp; On top of that it is difficult to be accurate with such large steps on the display.<br><br>To sum up, if you want a large minifig head with a nice curly mustache to display in your kitchen then this is ideal. If you want some scales for cooking then go out and get some electronic scales for less than this costs.<br>",TRUE,3,1,1,1,3
