I like that a lot and it's one of those things that Lego needed to do. I like the minifig sketches on the jacks, queens, jokers, and kings which is also pretty cool. Now what Lego needs to do is make more of these for different themes. I really like where this is going and I hope Lego succeeds in doing so.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
