"AddictedToStyrene","2009-06-25T04:57:36.483Z","Stubby but cute","I found this set at a Toyworld store in Australia. It is a very cute little tractor, but the built model is a bit stubby - more than the picture suggests. It goes together like the Space Buggy of yesteryear - 6 x 2 plate as a chassis, on 2x2 axles, with the bricks on top. 

The highlight of the set is the Indiana Jones hat in tan. My one came with several extra pieces - two more antenna/gear levers and a few 1x1 round flat pieces. 

It is surprisingly detailed for a tiny little tractor at an Impulse set price. For a little kid it would be a cute little toy tractor. For an AFOL it scales better as a 'ride on' mower. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BrianOg","2009-08-24T15:09:25.183Z","neat little set","Well this gets full marks straight out of the pack because its cute and it cost me a big fat ZERO, so thats just awesome.

Got it today at the LEGO store in Paris - I was actually buying 7634, and they threw this one in for me! 2 tractors for the price of one! 
In reality it looks more like a deluxe lawn-mower, especially when placed next to 7634. 
The minifig is pretty cool, with his tan fedora and red hair. Theres not a helluvalot to the vehicle, its small and its green, four wheels. 

Can't complain, it was free.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-12-29T11:59:51.327Z","Another Great ‘Freebie’…","This was another Daily Mirror promotion set, which just cost me the price of the paper and some petrol to get to the Trafford Centre to collect it!   So all in all pretty reasonable.

It’s a super little set, made up of just 28 pieces.   The whole construction was straight-forward and pleasing, it took a little under ten minutes to complete but that was taking my time.   The chassis features fixing points for the four wheels, the rear wheels are larger than the front adding to the realism.   The body of the tractor is presented in an agricultural ‘green’ with yellow seat.   Two white headlights are provided from which the sloping bonnet reaches the cab area.   There is also a small engine detail on the side of the model, also a gear lever.

The minifig wears green overalls and a white t-shirt; he also has an oversized hat to keep the sun off him when out in the fields.

Another excellent set from the Mirror, I think it could be my favourite from the entire series, and there are still quite a few on eBay if you missed out ;o)

Let’s hope the Daily Mirror ‘build’ on these sets for their 2010 promotions.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"United_Bricks","2009-12-13T09:44:40.247Z","Excellent","I got this set when the Daily mirror were giving twelve models for free this was the best one out of all twelve models.

This mini tractor is good to go with the lego farm. This is  one of the best lego mini models that I have. The best Thing what you got was the minfig. Their was no cons. I would give it a five out of five.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vynsane","2010-06-22T11:39:39Z","Daily Mirror Promo comes to The States via LEGO Stores!","<p><p>I received this as part of my Father's Day gift this year, since it was the freebie they were giving away at LEGO brand stores this month with a purchase of $50 or more. Add to that the double VIP points and this guy is almost MORE than free!</p><h4>Figure</h4><p><ul><li><b>Farmer</b> - In his green over-alls and white shirt, he certainly looks the part, although blue would have looked more like denim over-alls and set him apart from the mainly green construction of the tractor.</li></ul></p><h4>Accessories</h4><p><ul><li><b>Fedora</b> (tan, x1) - For this style of minifigure head accessory, the tan color rivals black in terms of rarity, only showing up in two sets - this one, and the large <a href=""/detail/?set=7637-1"">Farm</a>&nbsp;(while the Fedora shows up in black in only one set - Indiana Jones <a href=""/detail/?set=7682-1"">Shanghai Chase</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;you get two of them, making it relatively even with tan). The only colors that are more rare are the dark tan fedora that comes with the&nbsp;<a href=""/detail/?Set=8683-16"">Cowboy</a> in Collectible Minifigures series 1 and the purple version included with the Space Police 3 set <a href=""/detail/?set=5984-1"">Lunar Limo</a>.</li></ul></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>Comprised of a scant 28 pieces, this set still works better when assembled than some other 'impulse' size sets. Some have been small cars that look utterly ridiculous unless being driven by a shriner, or just a compilation of small bits and pieces that serve to augment your larger sets, but don't necessarily stand alone.&nbsp;</p><p>This set, however, is a tractor - and tractors can come in a variety of sizes, making this an appropriate build in scale with the minifigure. Aside from the figure, there are only five colors present: Predominantly green, yellow, and black with some light gray and a pair of translucent clear 1x1 studs rounding out the pack. What surprised me was the amount of 'extra' parts in this set - two extra (three total) levers (light gray base, black stick), two more light gray 1x1 round stud plates, two more translucent clear 1x1 round stud plates, and one extra light blue-gray small wheel hub (8mm diameter)! This brings a 28 piece set up to 35!</p><h4>Build</h4><p>The build is rather straight forward - I built this one merely by looking at the picture on the front of the baggie as opposed to even opening the instructions. A 2x6 black plate functions as the frame to which the wheels, seat, steering wheel and 'engine' are all affixed. Add farmer, and you're ready to mow!</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>This was a GREAT surprise addition to my Father's Day gift this year, as I had all but forgotten about it. I figured by the time the day rolled around they would have been out of stock, so never gave much thought to receiving one. As it stands, the rare fedora and wealth of extra pieces makes this a VERY welcome addition to my collection, and I recommend adding it to yours as well.</p></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,5

"Nesquik","2011-03-27T10:27:37.183Z","Small Tractor","I was able to acquire a number of these from 'The Mirror' newspaper offer, and feel that as far as freebies goes this was excellent.
