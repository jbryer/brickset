This remote should have done the trick. Next to that the protocol that the normal stick-remote speaks, has one side-effect: loose eye-contact, channel stops.<br>With this remote you don't have that. When I select the left one to speed n%, it remains that speed unless I send another signal over that same channel with either this remote or the stick-remote. This can be used in your advantage:</p><p><br></p><p>When using this remote for driving outside, I often notice that sunlight interferes with the signal of the regular stick-remote. In case that happens, the Lego-model simply stops its action. With this remote, I can select that same channel, set it to 50% (for example) and let the sun shine... the channel remains functioning on that same speed. This can of course also be the downside, since your model can drive off in that same sunset ;)<br><br>If you want more control over speed: best device you can have, since it is not simple on/off, but also half on...</p><p>The rating, sorry, but a 'set' with one piece is hard to rate, you either buy it because you want/need it or not...<br><font size=""+2""></font></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
