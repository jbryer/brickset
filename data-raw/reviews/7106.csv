The only negitive is that they have introduced a new power adpter and I have no idea why.  The Adpter is rated at 10v but the battery only kicks out 7.4.

They could have made this a 5 star product by keeping to the old 9V adpters and also rating the output at 9V.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

A lesser known fact regarding regular batteries is that they only deliver the nominal 1.5 volts when they're new, and the voltage drops as the battery discharges.  <br><br>This is why rechargeable batteries run at 1.2 volts.  Filling the standard PF battery box with rechargeable AA batteries will deliver 7.2 volts.<br><br>So is this simply a box of AAA Ni-MH rechargeable batteries?<br><br>Nope - it's a Lithium Ion Polymer battery pack.  This technology has evolved from the portable device market, (laptops, phones, etc) and as such the weight of the unit should be a bit lighter than 6 AAA batteries.  I've weighed mine - it's only 74g.  Six AAA Ni-MH batteries weigh about the same, without a plastic box.<br><br>OK, so it's only a few grammes, which is probably only of relevance for models where the battery weight will be a factor, i.e. trains!<br><br>Price wise it seems expensive, until you calculate the alternatives.  The battery capacity is 1100mAh.  The equivalent in AAA batteries would come in at about Â£15, however, since these batteries are normally sold in packs of four, you'd need to spend more than that to obtain one set, and as yet, there's no AAA battery box.<br><br>I'm not an electrical engineer, so I don't know about the many other pros and cons of differing rechargeable battery technology.  Suffice to say - this battery is aimed squarely at the train fans!<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3

Just make sure your Power Pack's Plug has the centre pin as positive.<br><br>This also applies to the Mindstorms NXT Battery, as well as any other Rechargeable LEGO Battery rated at 7.2-9.0 Volts....<br>",TRUE,3,5,1,5,3
