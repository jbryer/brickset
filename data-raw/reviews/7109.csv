The bottom trays are quite deep and useful for larger elements.  The removable tray above is shallower but also deep enough to put lots of little bits without worrying about losing them over the sides. And to cap it all, the six ""studs"" on the top have removable covers - really good for those small pieces you might only have a few of but want to keep together without getting lost.

I'm using mine as a minifig selection box - trays for legs, torsos, heads, arms, headgear etc.
