When we moved from Duplo rails to Lego rails, our big disappointment was seeing how constrainted the track layouts are with Lego rails. Duplo pieces fit together loosely so there was a lot of flex in the tracks which allowed us to buld really cool track layouts with a good collection of switches. The flexible track gives you the similar freedom now using Lego rails. You can make really cool layouts with many switches and loops thanks to the these truly flexibel pieces. 

I must say I was also pleasantly surprised by how sufficeint one box of flexibel track is. To overcome the geometry challanges, strategically placed 2 or 3 pieces are usually sufficient. I have built multiple loop tracks with random looking cross overs and bypasses and we never came close to using all the pieces. 

Once you start using these in your layouts, you will never bo back to the old constrained track layouts. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

With this you won't need to buy separate curved or straight rails anymore.

Just a box of these and some switches and you're all set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
