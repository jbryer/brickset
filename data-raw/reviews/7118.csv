It's just this really small car and there is no room for a patient. Its just a normal car.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-04-22T17:50:04.483Z","Looks Like a Medical Go-Kart","This is a really an odd looking car or it's a go cart with sirens. The go-cart doesn't really go into a set that has a doctor minifig unless there's a go-cart track and alot of go-carts included. However, I do like the fact that these would be great for spare parts. Overall, this needs work.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2011-01-04T22:25:44.017Z","Medic Car","<p>A little set to complete your little village clinic.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>No box, just polybag. The instructions is just a piece of paper. Don't expect any booklet.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Ordinary 'hospital' parts, like the 1x1 tile with the meter on top, etc.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>1 medic minifigure, with a medic buttoned coat, white trousers, eyeglasses, way-too-big hat, and a black suitcase.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Very easy and simple, 4 minutes at most.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Really simple (maybe even <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">too</span> simple). Just a car and a medic. What you see at the polybag is what you got, no more.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Certainly doesn't fit in any modern urban hosiptal (a full-fledged ambulance will do the job), maybe this small medic car will fit in a village clinic, or wherever there's a off-road terrain.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3
"sikennedy","2009-10-24T03:00:41.25Z","Really? a medical car?","Ok so its a nice wee car and given i got it for 65p with the newspaper promo, you cant complain about value for money. But its not really anything like any medic car i have seen before, other than the ones you see at football or rugby matches that have a stretcher to carry the injured player off. it reminds me more of the little carts you see around airports or railway stations, or a golf cart. I suppose you could add 2 seats on the back by extending it somehow and use it as a passenger transport or golf cart. So value for money it gets 5*, design as a medic car 1*, parts 3*, minifig 3*",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It comes with a rare&nbsp;black&nbsp;suitcase. The vehicle has a 7*4 base like the &nbsp;3177 Small Car set. Has a cool white 'racers mudguard' at the front and a normal mudguard at the back.
