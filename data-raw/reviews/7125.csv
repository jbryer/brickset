+ Beautiful set. As beautiful as Cafe Corner and Green Grocer. Very colorful.
+ Power functions motor.
+ 48x48 baseplate.
+ Sound brick that plays a melody.
+ 9 minifigs including 4 kids with short legs.
+ 8 jester heads and 8 tan beards.
+ Build goes by quickly mostly because of the repetition and because there are so many colors that hunting for pieces is easier.
+ Horses and sleighs go up and down as the carousel spins.

Cons:
- Build is repetitive. Some elements are repeated 8, 12, or 16 times.
- Stickers (the horses eyes and some gold foil decoration).
- Upside-down tan beards are supposed to be fleur de lys but they don't look anything like them.
- Motor isn't hidden at all and is kind of noisy.
- Short-leg minifigs can't sit, so they stand on the horses.
- Battery box is not easy to access if you need to change the batteries.   Requires some small disassembly.

Regarding the price, I think it's worth it. It has 3200+ pieces and it comes with a power functions motor, a sound brick, and a 48x48 baseplate. 10188 Death Star has 3803 pieces and that's US$400.

"Wells","2009-07-02T07:57:10.717Z","Easy build, but heavy hunting","This is so far a good set... I am in the middle of building it at the moment. As said before, there is quite a bit of repetition, but all you have to do is look at the set and you can tell that there is going to be some amount of repetition simply because of what it is... at least it isn't as bad as the repetition that occurs in the Ferris Wheel (4957-1).

I think my biggest peeve is the stickers... mainly because the stickers that came with mine were crumpled and some of them had come unstuck from the backing and were instead attached to some of the bags. I think the sticker sheets need to be placed in a bag with a cardboard backing so that they don't crumple like this. This is the second set that this has happened to me, and I really don't appreciate it.

I haven't heard the motor running, but given its position and exposure, I would have to guess that it is going to be noisy. A small building surrounding it would have been nice so that it is not visible, but I guess if you were to look at a normal carousel in a county fair, you would see that the motor is quite visible there as well, so there is some authenticity to it.

Chantastic's review is pretty much spot on, otherwise. The one other item I would mention is that the bags are not labeled or numbered, so it is a bit harder to progress through the build since you don't have any solid order in the bags. It is obvious that some of the bags will be used at a specific stage, and you don't have to open them immediately, but I just got into the first stages of building the base of the carousel that actually turns, and already 3/4 of the bags have had to be opened. This creates a huge number of pieces out and about that are becoming harder and harder to keep track of.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brickeddad","2009-07-14T01:57:53.247Z","A flagship product that isn't Star Wars","First off, no offense to Star Wars Fans!  This set includes some wonderful details and special pieces, and everyone who has seen the finished model loves it.  It deserves to be called a flagship because of the design (which is like a real carousel), and because it can inspire many children (and children at heart) to ""Play Well"".  It uses some nice SNOT techniques, incorporates some Technic mechanicals, and nicely demonstrates how mostly rectangular bricks can be utilized to make a very complex structure.

The set has 25 (!) un-numbered bags, some with bags of small pieces within.  Most of these were open within an hour of starting the build.  Spend some time sorting and the build will go much quicker.  As the other reviewers have said there is repetition, but not so much as to get tedious.  Most of the parts that are repeated still give you some satisfaction in seeing them completed (e.g. the parts with the jester heads).

My set also had mangled stickers.  Customer service is sending a replacement, but this part is back-ordered, so I'm using what I have and will replace the creased and crumpled ones later.  While like most fans I don't like stickers, you should note that most are shiny metallic, so they do add to the set an effect not possible with printing on bricks.  I think the horses' eyes could have been printed however, as there are existing Lego bricks with eyes on them.

The motor is not too noisy, but I do wish the sound brick had a little more volume to it.  (My brick isn't all there as the batteries were bad, and one actually had leaked inside the brick.  It works with new batteries but it doesn't consistently trigger the way it's supposed to.  CS is sending me a new one).

My only beef with the design is with the cloth tent roof pieces (these were also scrunched a bit, but they ""relaxed"" over a couple of days with hanging them vertically).  The top of these pieces is connected with a small blue Technic pin, and the grip is a bit tenuous.  If it comes detached, they are a little fiddly to re-attach.  Unfortunately, I keep wanting to remove parts of the roof to show others the mechanism underneath.

The set has playability, but is a little delicate for some young ones (who naturally want to put the figures on the carousel).  As a display piece, it would attract a lot of new Lego fans or (in a store) sell a lot of other Lego sets.

Summary:

Pros:  what's not to like about a carousel?
         tons of special parts
         intricate details
         price is justified by the parts count and special pieces
         nine minifigs

Cons: Attachment of the tent tops a little iffy.
         needs better packaging to avoid mangling the stickers, manuals and tent tops.
        my sound brick had two (of three) dead batteries on arrival, one which had leaked and strangely had reversed polarities!
        high price (though justified) means this isn't for everyone.
        could be frustrating build for young inexperienced builders (set is 16+ for a reason)
        the children minifigs (four) don't bend at the waist

The set is built but awaiting a new sound brick and stickers.  Lego CS is sending me the replacements, so how can I stay mad with TLG?  Despite the packaging and sound brick gripes, it looks and works great, and I highly recommend this kit.  5* model, 3* packaging, 1* to the battery supplier.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I will add some from the Technic range to see what it looks like.

<p>First when you open the box 25 or 26 bags (unnumbered) fall out.&nbsp; That is a LOT of pieces.&nbsp;We did eventually get it done after 3 nights of works (around 6-8 hours).</p>

"SgtSmash","2010-09-10T15:42:39.36Z","An incredible building experience","The Lego Grand Carousel was/is the largest Lego set I've ever assembled, not to mention the&nbsp;most expensive. I was a bit worried that if I did not purchase this set when I did, it would end up costing me much more later, to the point where I would never own it. Unfortunately Lego's have that effect:&nbsp;once they go out of production, the greedy folks on Ebay and Amazon take over!&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I wasn't quite sure how the Carousel would factor into my town, but figured at the very least, it would make an awesome collector's piece that could rest on a shelf. At over 3000 bricks with many unique colors, pieces and decals, this was going to be a massive undertaking.&nbsp;I commandeered our kitchen table, and&nbsp;opened the box,&nbsp;at least 20 (UN-NUMBERED!) bags of parts came out, along with a very wrinkled sticker sheet (which was very disappointing). <br/>&nbsp;<br/>I figured the&nbsp;easiest way to build would be to divide and conquer by&nbsp;sorting the pieces by color. This feat alone took me at least 2 hours. In the end,&nbsp;I had massive piles of colored bricks staring back at me. Again, you do not get the luxury of having numbered bags. Just start from page one of the manual. As the first couple evenings wore on, the Carousel took shape...thus beginning the dreaded&nbsp;repetitive building. So many repetitive steps, but I tried to get around this by building&nbsp;each component&nbsp;like an assembly line, for example: If you have to build&nbsp;8 of the exact same&nbsp;item,&nbsp;build all 8 step-by-step at the same time, opposed to completing&nbsp;one piece and starting over&nbsp;7 more times.&nbsp;This saved a lot of time.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Without taking more time going into the build, I will say that the inner-workings of the&nbsp;Carousel is a Lego engineering feat.&nbsp;I won't go into too much detail, but when you see your creation come to life with a flip of the switch, it&nbsp;is a very gratifying experience to hear the little tune and see the riders going up and down and round and round.&nbsp;You won't want to turn it off for about 20 minutes. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Once together, I must warn that the set is quite brittle. Little hands will cause this thing to fall apart time and time again. I've had to overhaul the set once already to refresh it back to brand new condition. It's a great set, don't get me wrong. But I would have to say this is an ""Adult Only"" set. If you incorporate it into your town with road plates, it is a natural across the street from the Grand Emporium and other modular buildings, and the City Hall from the Town Plan set. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>As far as the wrinkled stickers, Lego sent me a new set. It would be nice if they would begin putting sticker sheets for their sets between a couple pieces of cardboard or a stiff envelope. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>For $249.00, it sure wasn't the most expensive set out there, but I don't think I would want to build anything larger than this. An&nbsp;excellent experience, something you and the people in your life will treasure and ""ooh"" and ""Ahh"" over for&nbsp;a long time.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;",TRUE,5,5,5,3,4
"terrynsue","2011-02-23T17:14:11.223Z","The WOW Factor","<p>First I would like to say that I purchased this set just as it was being retired so I was able to stll get it for the $250.</p>
<p>This set was intended to be my return to LEGO building after a 30 year break from the hobby.&nbsp; Prior to building this set my largest was only a little over 200 pieces so the mere increase in piece count was enough to boggle me a little bit.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago they didn't modularize the building experiance so I didn't initially understand what people ment by numbered bags.&nbsp; So when I opened the box and 25 bags fall out and then I jump right into the sorting factor it was not a disappointment to me.&nbsp; Truthfully I actually enjoy sorting through all the pieces before hand, The problem that I had is that I would be building this at night after my 2 year old went to bed and I did not factor in that it might take me multiple sittings to complete.&nbsp; So every night I put everything back into a storage bin only to have to resort out the next night.&nbsp; So my advise to anyone purchasing this set is to either have an area to you don't mind this sitting out for a couple of days or make sure you have multiple bins to keep your pieces seperated at the close of each session.</p>
<p>Now on the the building experiance.&nbsp; Lego technology has significantly improved over the years and it was really an enjoyment to see many of these technological advances used in this set.&nbsp; To give a younger reader the feel for how much has changed, the last set I got was one of the first to have min-figures with movable limbs.&nbsp; Yes there is repetition but look at what you are building, a carousel, an object that by very nature is a circular object were it is a uniformed pattern around the circumfrence so the repetition didn't bother me and as one review already stated it you do it in assembly line style it actually is kind of fun.</p>
<p>The real enjoyment came from while building this set you actually get to watch it go up as if it were a real carousel.&nbsp; Unfortunately after I built this set and went to run the motor I found that the motor that came with it was broke, but a simple email to TLG as I was up and running in no time at all.</p>
<p>To reiterate other reviews this is not a set for younger people to play with but more for admiring.&nbsp; I personnally love this set and it has become the centerpiece of my now growing collection.&nbsp; If you can get this set for under $300 you really need to jump at the opportunity.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"coppertopolo","2011-06-03T20:31:52.867Z","Helpful tweaks for the Grand Carousel","<p>I just thought I would try to help out any of you that are about to build the LEGO Grand Carousel. I just finished and have found some ""tweaks"" that might save you some exasperating moments.<br><br>First, it is true that the base plate is very finicky and will tend to fall apart, BUT there are some things you can do to remedy this. Mine kept falling apart and sticking whenever I tried to have the Carousel rotate. One of the reasons for this seems to be that as you add things to the top of the carousel (the riding figures, the Jester faceplates, the gold starburst faceplates) it tends to droop and this causes problems in the rotation. The bottom base plate no longer clears the LEGO bricks (the dark gray double curved brick, and the dark gray 4 curved brick - the first sit on dark blue 2 by 2 bases, the latter on a 2 by 4 base) that are meant to help the base plate rotate - they sit at the four sides of the center of the carousel, just inside the baseplate, just outside the central core. <br><br>Once I removed all four of these ""helpers"" the carousel was free to move and has not caused me any problem since.<br><br>Second, the large gear wheel that moves the base plate was pressing against the baseplate much too hard when I had it attached to the shock absorber. When I detached it from the shock absorber and just let it rest against the base plate on its own accord - the base plate parts held together and the Carousel still turned just fine. <br><br>Now I am happy I purchased the Grand Carousel, as it turns and plays music with very little attention. Yes, occasionally a base plate section will loosen, but it is fairly easy to fix - much easier than having to rebuild an entire section - like I had to do before I did my ""tweaks"".<br></p><p><br></p><p>PS - One more bit of help - when you place the top most flag - have it point toward the sound brick, that way, when you need to replace the batteries, you won't have to remove a bunch of the white canvas pieces to find it. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,3

<h2><strong>Overall Rating</strong></h2>

<p>4/5.&nbsp; This is a truly beautiful looking completed set in my opinion.&nbsp; Pictures don&#39;t actually do it justice.&nbsp; It&#39;s huge and colorful and just plain fun to look at.&nbsp; Although as others have pointed out, the motion is not perfectly smooth and the sound brick is really not that great, it&#39;s still a wholly impressive set for display.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>I got this completed set in a bulk purchase.&nbsp; It was actually still about 1/2 built and still in the box separated from the rest of the 30 pounds of Lego.</p>

<p>Having read other&#39;s comments, I decided not to deconstruct the entire set and start from scratch and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t.&nbsp; Even with it half built, there was still a feeling of repetition as there are many sections of the instructions that are &quot;repeat 8 times&quot;.&nbsp; There were not too many interesting build techniques and overall it does not feel sturdy and solid like an official set should in my mind.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>I give this set a high rating for parts.&nbsp; There are certainly a lot of unique pieces that can only be found here (or only found in huge quantities here).&nbsp; The set is vibrant and there are lots of great colors on display.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>Good for careful play, but the collector&#39;s status of this one would probably keep me from letting my small children play with it.&nbsp; As mentioned, it&#39;s certainly fragile; the stairs in particular, but also the horses&#39; connectivity to the frame.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>Considering how much this one has raised in value, it would have been a great purchase at the time if you kept it new in the box.&nbsp; Is it worth $1000 now for a used copy?&nbsp; Probably not, but if you think it is, you can always buy mine ;-)</p>
