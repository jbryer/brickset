"dvsDave","2009-10-05T10:02:07.31Z","Excellent Parts list, and great build techniques!","The best LEGO set I've built this year!  (haven't had a crack at the Cafe Corner sets yet, so bear with me)

Like the main description says, this is chock-FULL of interesting colors and rare parts.  They start you off building the lampstand and the park bench.  I LOVE the clear globes, the final effect is rather stunning.

The tree is nicely done, lots of detail, but a distinct low-key approach to ornaments.  (Although you'll have a lot of leftover transparent studs, easy to add plenty of extra ornamentation to the tree)

The Jack-in-the-box was a nice treat.  A simple build that was nonetheless a quick and fun build that is just so comical as to put a smile on your face.  The little toy teddy bear, on the other hand, was a royal pain in the butt. The instructions were not well laid-out for that one and it seemed silly to stack the torso and head before adding the tiles.  

Onto the toy shop!  I just have to say, I loved the color scheme and the overall look and feel.  The build is well don't and the small details are great!  Someone spent a lot of time on the chimney, getting the spacing and feel of an old stone chimney just right.  

The toy train in the window is simple but fun.  After I was done, I wanted to build a toy train set that went around the tree. (I may do that this week!)  The details on the interior are nicely done.  The roof is magnificent.  An absolutely wonderful design and easy to implement in other projects.  I would recommend picking up this set, if just to learn this technique!  (assuming you don't know it already, I did, but I think this set implements it well)    The Power Brick really does add the perfect touch to this winter set.  Just the right shade of amber/orange.  I only wish they'd included a mechanism to keep the light on instead of it being just a momentary button.  

I sincerely hope that LEGO will keep making this theme every Holiday, making this a collectible winter village where LEGO would release a new building, or two :) every year to add to your collection.  

One more note.  My wife saw this set and instead of hemming and hawing over letting me get it, she was excited and eager.  She helped me build the whole thing.  Took us about an hour and a half.  She loved it.  If you have a significant other who isn't into LEGO, this is the perfect gateway into the wonderful world of LEGO.

"Widdi","2009-10-05T15:13:46.653Z","Best Set, built this year","I've just bought this Set at Legoland Guenzburg on Oct. 3rd, after I fell in Love with this stunning design and it's SNOT Roof technique, etc. seeing the first Pics some weeks ago.

Now to the Contents: Over 800 pieces and 7 Minifigs for just 60 Euros here in germany.

1. Bench and Lamppost:

The bench is a little too huge for Minifig Scale, but completely brick-built and looks like a real bench, but taken away the snow.  And the lamp post just looks like a real vintage lantern, despite the clear globes, but the black lamppost look's really nice. There are 3 Minifigsa on it. a kid, who doesn't like the carolling, as he wants to throw snowballs at them. And the two carollers. The male has an Airline pilot torso and the woman, has a long black skirt and her cape, made up of two separate capes.

2. Christmas Tree with Gifts

The tree is a extremly realistic design. It just looks like a huge christmas tree, and this as a brick- and plate built construction. The Star is a belville snowflake, but works great. The gifts are a tan teddy bear, which contains 18 parts by itself, the jack in the box, is open, due to the restrictions of Lego Parts. And the last is a genuine blue gift, maybe containing a huge LEGO set. A ladder is included  and extremely realistic with it's brown colour and stand, looking like an actual wooden ladder. And the woman with the classic space-Torso is trimming it with a chain of lights. And the carollers have a new singing face.

3. The Building

The building is a great and with 24x10 studs compact design, which really looks like an old rural shop. It has a nice SNOT-Roof Technique, with some technic bricks. And a lattice roof part, with some Technic Liftarms at the shop's roof. The interior doesn't have, much furniture, but a wooden floor and an open fire, giving it a real 19th century impression. Then there's a cash desk and two displays with a micro steam locomotive and a robot. There's a clock, below the roof, too. Using a ladder, you'll get to the small work shop, including a swivel chair and a desk with some tools. Seems that he's making or repairing a small toy race car, as there's another mini set. The chimney has some tile techniques, making it look historically. The light brick could've been left or maybe made to light up permanently, instead of instant pushing, to light up the work shop. The snowy landscaping is nearly perfect, with snowy roofs, looking like accumulated snow, instead of straight slopes. There's one minifig in this subpart the shop owner, finishing the snow man on the box scene

4. Snowman, and skiing kids

This are the nifty little details, making it a perfect winter scene. The snowman looks extremly realistic, with it's round parts, the arms, altough made of antenna bricks and the cylinder head. Only a carrot is missing, since the one in the set is too big. The skiing kids have plain torsos, but not only skis, even poles and can be modified to adult skiers by just changing the legs.


Verdict:
 A perfect 5/5, due to the great value for the money at over 10pts/ Euro and the fantastic, but still compact design of this set. If you're looking at it, it looks like a real christmas/winter scene in an old rural village, somewhere in the mountains. Including the kitsch singers and the huge carol books. 
Honestly I couldn't wait for christmas to build it, after looking at the box.

"sudorum","2010-01-01T21:29:52.577Z","A Holiday Special ","For a seasonal set, which is usually just a poorly built ornament, I was surprised. There are three sections to the set. The first is the christmas tree, with lights and a ladder to access the top. The second is the unique lamppost with bench. It even includes a snow pile! The only rare minifigures are the carolers, who are superb. The final part of the set is the toy shop. The downstairs has a cash register, a tiled floor, fireplace, and two toy displays. The upstairs is small, but has a chair, worktable, and a light that actually shines. I'd have to say the best part of the entire set are the ""toys"". They include a jack in the box, a wrapped package, a train, robot, car, and monkey(I think!) Definitely worth buying.",FALSE,5,5,5,3,5

"romdam","2009-12-28T04:59:20.733Z","Nice Christmas themed set","For a little (so it seemed) set, this took me forever to put together.  Probably like 3 hours.  It was a lot of fun as this was the first set I put together in about 3 years.  It is just such a nice Christmas set to display.  I really hope we get a new set like this every year.  My only problem I had with this is that the larger roof pieces don't want to stay on.  I have tried and tried to adjust this and that but still they want to pop off when the building is touched.

Otherwise, love the design, love the minifigs, love all the little extras. 

Oh, and the tree.  One of the coolest parts of the set!

"brix","2010-08-27T04:11:39.937Z","An ammazing Christmas set","<h4>I bought this set the minute it was available and I'm glad&nbsp;I did as not long after, it became hard to find and the price rose by Â£5.</h4>
<p>I built it mid&nbsp;November and I was amazed by the detail and the overall Christmassy feel of the set. I use it mainly for display rather than to play with as at the age of 13, I'm getting a bit old to play with LEGO.</p>
<p>My favourite part of the set is the main building as it has a very traditional, warm feeling to it. I really like the toys on display too. For me, the best part of the building is the light brick as it adds to the cosy feeling.</p>
<p>The tree&nbsp;was bigger than I expected and it's decorated really well, expecially with the star on top and the presents underneath.</p>
<p>The final thing I really like about the set is the lamposts as they look quite realistic.</p>
<p>The only problem I had with this set is the roof as it doesn't seem to stay on properly and I thought the set should have&nbsp;come with a big white base plate so all the parts could fit on.</p>
<p>I'm glad that another Christmas set is coming tis year (Winter Village Bakery), just a shame it's going to be more expensive!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"Nesquik","2011-03-27T10:36:24.39Z","I'm split on this one","I normally don't like being too blunt, but I think this set has a reason to be as it represents poor value for money. The RRP has, for its shelf life, remained at Â£45 and the content simply doesn't justify spending this money. This is a pity, for the models themselves are wonderful (if fragile in many aspects), but as usual with many LEGO products, the overly large box and deceiving image give the impression that their is more to build when the reality is that the centre piece is just a small wooden shop with several smaller builds.<div><br></div><div>This is also a 'shelf' piece in my view, as the models are just too delicate to let kids play with. On a positive note, there are several excellent unique bricks and you're also getting a fair amount of great minifigures.</div>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,2

"DrFrankenstein","2015-03-02T22:29:18.673Z","Very imaginative holiday set","<p>The very first Winter Village set is perhaps the most interesting one in the series. The setting consists of a couple mini-builds, each of which is different and quite imaginative. The centerpiece of the set is the tall Christmas tree which has a MOC feeling to it and is lots of fun to see grow layer by layer. The white kitten, the snowman, the presents, the carolers - all add nice details to the set. The toymaker&#39;s shop is also very cool in terms of architecture, decor, and toy displays.</p>

<p>The two downsides to this set are the fragility of the toy store&#39;s tower (the roof in particular is very lightly attached) and the chimney (not bad, but looks a bit strange with the 1x1 tiles sticking out in all directions). Also, the heavy use of dark brown and black colors make the set look a little too traditional when compared with the more recent Winter Village sets.</p>

<p>The Winter Village Toy Shop is a classic amongst the Winter Village sets that is well worth picking up, if you can find it at a good price. It&#39;s no wonder that it started a whole LEGO series that is still going strong.</p>

"Brickmaster48","2014-04-05T06:12:23.57Z","The First and One of Best Editions to The Winter Village","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This review is on the 10199 Winter Village Toy shop a great set and excellent edition to any Lego holiday village.</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>The box shows a classic holiday scene with people caroling, singing, skiing and there is even a man making a snowman. This is all happening in front of the wonderful toy shop. On the back of the box it shows pictures of the interior of the toy shop and a boy spying on one of his must have toys. Other scenes you can recreate on the back of the box include kids looking at and wondering what is under the tree.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Many of the parts are pretty standard, but you do get a white cat, a lego string, ladder and cool translucent half sphere pieces that clip together to make cool lamp post glass. You also get cool fire pieces for the fire place. Some pieces are a bit more rare though, these include a mutitude of pine trees a grey frog and a clock. But the pieces that I think are #1 in this set are the jester hat, the translucent star piece, and of course the light brick.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;in this set are also pretty standard, but I think they are still great. There is a woman decorating the Christmas tree, three children, a shop keeper, and the figures that I think are the best are the carolers. The carolers have cool carol books made from a handle piece and a angled piece. Something though that I specifically liked was the way they created a double-sided cape on the female minifigure. This was created by putting two capes(one black, one red) &nbsp;on the minifig.</p>

<h3>The build&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The build I found longer but fun and intriguing at the same time. The Christmas tree was probably the most challenging because of how you had to put the leaves together, it could be confusing to some but I found it as a fun challenge. The toy shop itself I found to be very fun to put together. It would probably be on the list of more challenging minifig scale builds, only because of the chimney and roofs though.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When all the building is done you end up with a great holiday scene. The Christmas tree looks great and the toy shop is spectacular. The exterior of the toy shop is beautiful. With sweeping swags above the window and holiday wreaths it is marvelous.&nbsp;The interior of the toy shop is simple but charming. There is a cash register, the toys of course (a train and robot), and even&nbsp;a fire place! There is a clock above the shop&#39;s interior and above the shop there is a workbench for the shopkeeper to make new toys, and of course the only way he can make these toys on late nights is with&nbsp;the light brick that hangs above the bench.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"IndyXander","2013-11-03T12:08:34.967Z","Winter Toy Shop","<div>This was my first &quot;Winter Village set&quot; and I believe the first Winter Village set in the series. The set as a whole looks nice on display at Christmas, along with the others in the series.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This set comes with 7 minifigures: A Toymaker, 2 Carolers, 3&nbsp;Children and a Girl. The minifigs can make a nice looking scene, decorating the Christmas Tree or queuing outside the Toy Shop!</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are three main areas you build.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Firstly, the park bench and lamp&nbsp;post. The lamp&nbsp;post uses some nice building techniques, such as the domes covering the lights. The park bench is also cleverly built.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arguably, the best part of the set is the BIG Christmas Tree. The tree uses some advanced ways of building and is a delight.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Finally is the Toy Shop itself. This Toy Shop is a reasonable size and has some nice decor, such as the Robot and Train in the window. The Toymakers&#39; workshop is above the shop below. It has a nice looking window, however it is quite a small space inside.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, This set is a joy to build and display and if you can find it, I would recommend it in a heartbeat.&nbsp;</div>
