"capnrex","2009-09-06T13:50:55.5Z","Tantive IV","This is simply the best set I have ever experienced. Forget the Death Star, forget the Republic Gunship and forget the Republic Dropship with AT-OT Walker (well don't forget them because they are still all awesome) But seriously, this set is fantastic.

First, the figures, the figures are pretty cool, but all but one of them have been seen before. However the figure which is not seen before, Captain Antilles, is very nice, it has a double face, on one side he has a smile on his face and on the other he has a face for when Darth Vader is strangling him!

But onto the model! I will start at the front as that seems appropriate. The bridge is the first thing you come to, it has a cool opening mechanism and space for two seats inside, the detail on the outer covering pieces is printed on, and there are some controls inside which are a nice touch.

Behind that, there are twin blaster turrets, one on top, and one on the bottom, they can move up and down, and turn 360 degrees. 

Inside the main area is a small command centre and Leia's desk. There is also a small storage container. There is also some great details on the outside of this section.

Behind that there is a small area where a cargo sled can be stored to carry the storge container.

Next there are the two escape pods, they are both the same and consist of a small control console inside and space for one person. There is a dark red piece on the end and this andds some great detail. 

Finally, we reach the engine area, there are eleven engines and they look quite spectacular from the back!

Overall there is no doubt that I would recommend this set to anyone. In my opinion the price is reasonable, the only thing I could say against this model is that I had a piece missing, a printed controle console, but you can order a replacement so that's fine.

Overall - 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lumix","2009-09-18T14:40:04.75Z","One of the best Star Wars sets ever released!","I have made a full review here:
http://www.hispalug.com/foro/index.php?topic=8129.0

The review features photos both of the building process and the completed model, photos compairing the lego model vs the real model and other photos compairing this set to other similar-sized sets. The review also includes animated GIFs to show the set playability and a video.

This set has been highly anticipated, given that, so far, there was only another set that represented a ship as iconic and beautiful as the Tantive IV, the UCS 10019. The 10198 is related to the 10019 in the same way as the 6211 ISD is related to the UCS 10030 ISD. The new Tantive IV is a playable Tantive IV version, but highly detailed and big enough to be a centerpiece and a show model. 

The building process is lenghty (1400+ pieces) and very system-like. There are many small pieces that add detail and ""greebling"", and many bricks and slopes. 
There are also some Technic pieces to create a solid inner structure. The eleven engines are not all equal, which makes building them less repetitive. I've uploaded some photos of the building process here, in case you are interested in seeing how the set is built:
http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=400983

The model is a big one once finished. It's almost as lenghty as the 6211 ISD and more or less the same as the 7665 - Republic Cruiser. You can see some comparison photos here:
http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=401341

This new Tantive IV is a beauty of a ship. It's very well-designed and has almost no ""gaps"", unlike 6211 ISD or 8039 Venator. It has a compact design and is very sturdy. You can only grab it by holding it at the lower-centre. The ship is swoosheable, although not as much as other smaller sets. All the small pieces add a lot of detail, specially in the engines and the sides, and the ship resembles the original a lot, as you can see here:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10198/p1070081.jpg

The set has NO stickers (yaiii), which is great. I must say that the white colour used in the printed cockpit is not exactly equal to the rest of the white-colored pieces, but oh well. Anyway the ship is beautiful. Here's another shot from behind:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10198/p1070174.jpg

They've included some gadgets in this set, so it has decent playability. You can open the cockpit (trough a well-designed mechanism), rotate and elevate the radar, rotate and elevate both turrets, and extract the upper central section to access Leia's chambers. Leia's desk resembles a lot Palpatine's desk from 8039 - Venator.
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10198/p1070143.jpg

Both escape pods can be detached, and one of them holds C-3PO and R2-D2, like in the movie.
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10198/p1070159.jpg

There's a cargo vehicle in the central area that can be extracted too, by removing the upper panel above the vehicle. The vehicle has a nice clean desing. There's a box in Leia's chambers that can be carried in the cargo vehicle, a nice touch.

This animated GIF shows all the moveable parts in the ship (it may take a few moments to load completely):
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10198/p1070165a.gif

10198 includes 5 minifigs: Princess Leia (similar to 10188 one, but with smaller eyes), R2-D2 (grey head), C-3PO, rebel officer (similar to those of 7668 set) and one exclusive minifig, capt. Raymus Antilles, with two faces. It's a nice selection, but the set could have included one more minifig or at least a chromed C-3PO, given that 10198 is an anniversary edition set. Here's a close-up of the minifigs:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/10198/p1070089.jpg

As for the price, 159 Eur for 1406 pieces gives a 0.11â‚¬ / piece ratio. It's not as bad as other sets like 7676, 10195 or Dooku's solar sailer, but it's not cheap also. Overall it's only a bit overpriced, but not as much as other SW sets.

Last but not least, I've made a video showing the set's playability. You can watch it here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXh4_oUSz1A

I absolutely recommend this set. It's big, very detailed, has decent playability and it's beautiful, it begs to be shown. Sure it's not 100% perfect, but is one of the best SW sets ever made. Full photo gallery here:

PROS
- Big and very detailed.
- Beautiful design, very well-finished.
- Very similar to the ""real"" model.
- Iconic model.
- Exclusive minifig.
- Decent playability.
- NO STICKERS!

CONS
- Does not have hallway to recreate the movie scene.
- Could use more minifigs or at least a chromed C-3PO.
- Engine exhaust should be red / orange (easy to mod, though).
- A bit overpriced, but not as much as other Star Wars sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2009-11-13T22:03:08.873Z","The 2nd Rebel Blockade Runner","I'll start with the minifigs. You get Leia, C3Po, R2, a rebel pilot, and Captain Antilles. Antilles happens to be the only new character, and he has a double sided face. The spacecraft itself is sturdily constructed--there are no obvious gaps or empty interiors. The cockpit has two seats, one located on either side. The top and bottom gun turrets both rotate. The main command center has a desk for Leia; however, it is a bit too similar to Palpatine's desk from the Ventator Republic Cruiser. The center of the ship also has computers and room to store a crate and two other minifigs. The near rear section has two identical escape pods, which can fit two people. Compared to the UCS version of the model, this set is probably too small. However, its interior detail and playability makes up for this tolerable flaw.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,3,5,5,4

Cons:

*cockpit is a little funky, not very sturdy and the glass parts are not the same white as the rest of the ship.
*does not sit flat. you have to take off the bottom guns for it to set down.
*needs more rebels. for 150 bucks it needs a few more guys... come on LEGO!
*agree with the rear colored engines. yellow is weird.

"Caramel","2011-08-12T19:44:50.947Z","The classic begining","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When i got this set i was so excited but when i built it the excitement kind of dropped. The ship has little inside space or detail and the sides kept popping out. I dont know if this was just me or if there is somthing wrong with the design. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Other then these few flaws the set is preaty good. The ship has excellent outter detail and includes the area the star destroyer shot it. Also the figs are excellent. There are of corse an R2-D2 and a C-3PO which buy now everyone has tons of. There is also a Leia which disapointed me because of the fact mine had flat hair.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ship also has two escape pods and a green supply car which are stored on and under a sensor array.</p>

"Niallskie","2011-03-06T18:42:20.957Z","Awesome ship ready for battle","<p>I've been wanting this set for awhile and just got this last week from a friend who has a local store, ofcourse I got it at an awesome price much lower than its retailed price. I actually just finished building it and it is a very very nice piece. I got most of the transport ships that SW lego had out and this is a great addition to my collection. I definitely love the color schem on this ship, I know that was dependent on the artist who made it for the movie, but the translation to the lego bricks is amazing. I love this set but have a couple things that could have used improvement if you asked me. First thing I noticed is that it has no stable handle for the ship. The big ships like the Venator (the&nbsp;handle that swings out so you can carry it), another one is with the 7675 AT-TE ( the handle that pops out so you can lift it). On this ship there was none, I mean the swooshability of the ship is nice but there are tendencies that you might hold the wrong part and it will disingage is there. The space inside is small but that is a given&nbsp;because of the scale of the model. The thing is you cant have a minifigure standing up while the cover is on. I guess other than that I love everything about this ship, specially there is no sticker. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going to the build of the ship, its also fantastic and very intricate as all the other big ships. The big cannons are very cool as well as the 4 small ones. Love the boosters, they make the ship look so grand and ready for light speed. Details with the small lego bricks give is mechanical look when looked from a far. Would be nice if they have extra minifigures, usually sets over $100 have over 5 minifigures... oh and no guns for protection? Again..this set is awesome but can't say if the price is actually too high for this one, what im sure of is this is a set worth having.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

The red used throughout is a beautiful burgundy which matches perfectly with the original.&nbsp; There are a few special pieces, like the clear cockpit tops, but generally speaking, you're just getting a lot of white parts, as well as a LOT of small, grey, detail parts.</p><p><br></p><p>The set is solidly built, but is kind of tricky to pick up, as it lacks a carrying handle, and there are a few spots where you can't really grab it without breaking a part off.&nbsp; The space inside is also very limited, so there's not much play possible there.&nbsp; It's really more of a display piece, and it works brilliantly for that.&nbsp; It's almost at the UCS level, detail-wise.<br></p><h4>Pros</h4>

Best ship in the fleet by an absolute mile!","<p>I love this set!</p><p>There are big problems in terms of how to handle the ship - it takes a while to get to know where you can grip it without breaking pieces off; and the sensor array and gun turret on the underside mean it doesn't sit well unless you make some sort of stand for it. The escape pods do seem a little bland, and the colour of the top part of the cockpit isn't quite right.</p><p>But these are all so easy to forgive when you look at what it's got right...</p><p>Apart from the cockpit pieces, the pieces that make up the escape pods and one part of the body, and the wheels that make up the end of the engines there are no particularly odd or unusable pieces.

The minifigures sit in it well, although there isn't much space in the main compartment when the roof is on. And it's a but of a shame that the roof doesn't fix at all - it falls off very easily. And Star Wars Lego is never very good value, but this is far better value than most other sets of this size.</p><p><br></p><p>The detailing is the real showpiece:</p><p>The sides of the cockpits, the control panels in it, the central spine of it all combine to make it look great; the first section before the main part of the body is smooth with good detailing; the gun turrets look great; the underside is well crafted (unlike, say, the ugly belly of the 2011 Falcon); the sloped sides, industrial bits between, and roof of the main compartment are stunningly good looking; the fins look good and the sloping through the sections of the body are good; and the engine blocks are varied, smooth with bags of detailing, and look absolutely stunning from behind!</p>

"murrayhenson","2014-01-05T16:37:21.577Z","The Force is strong with this one","<p>I picked this up late - just past this Christmas, long after the set stopped being produced, so ended up paying a premium for it. &nbsp;However, if you read through the following review I think you'll see that - in my opinion - it was money well-spent.</p>
<h4>Pricing/PPP comments</h4><p>I paid the princely sum of 750 PLN aka 150 GBP/230 USD/180 EUR, including shipping. &nbsp;I purchased it from a site in Poland (http://www.klockolandia.pl). &nbsp;This, despite being about 20-25 percent over the original MSRP, is still a pretty good deal. &nbsp;As of the writing of this review, the set retails for somewhere between 220 and 260 GBP on the various Amazon Europe sites.</p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I don't often review the packaging but I happened to like this box/packaging simply because it was stuffed FULL of bricks in many, many plastic bags. &nbsp;When emptying it, it seemed like baggies of bricks just kept falling out. &nbsp;Plus the box looks nice. &nbsp;I like the little ""Special 10th Anniversary Edition"" tag.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Normally I never review parts because I don't buy sets for MOCing. &nbsp;However, I will comment on two issues. &nbsp;First, two ""connector peg with friction"" elements (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/ajax/getParts.aspx?Design=2780&amp;aid=hsi2780"">http://www.brickset.com/ajax/getParts.aspx?Design=2780&amp;aid=hsi2780</a>) were missing. I didn't discover this until the very end when assembling the last of the double turbo lasers which rely on the pegs-with-friction in order to have the gun barrels stay where pointed. &nbsp;This was a minor issue since I had plenty extra pegs from other sets. &nbsp;Secondly, since there are no stickers there are a lot of printed elements. &nbsp;In particular, there's a number of 1x2 flat plates with printing on them... and there have definitely been some printing registration issues. &nbsp;I've illustrated this below, showing the ""official"" image versus the 8 1x2 flat tile bricks. &nbsp;It's not a HUGE issue but it is noticeable.</p><div>[img]http://cache.lego.com/media/bricks/5/2/4162982.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_10198_02.jpg[/img]</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I initially thought the only new minifigs were Princess Leia and Captain Antilles, although I noted later that the Rebel Scout Trooper minifig in this set is frowning while the Rebel Scout Trooper minifig I had from the Tantive IV/Alderaan set (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75011"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75011</a>) is smiling. &nbsp;R2-D2 and C3PO are in loads of other sets.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build: &nbsp;it starts out like a stabbed rat. &nbsp;The first bit is the technic-based spine and boy it is a great, tough (sturdy) thing. &nbsp;It feels like - at the earliest moments of the build - that you're embarking on a nice, big, satisfying build. &nbsp;There are slow bits (the engines) but it's still fun. &nbsp;Bonus: &nbsp;NO STICKERS! &nbsp;Not a single one.</p><p>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_10198_01.jpg[/img]</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I honestly think that this is my best big model. &nbsp;My Maersk ship and Discovery Shuttle are both great, but I really, really enjoyed the construction of this. &nbsp;The only comparable set might be the Maersk train in terms of the joy of the build. &nbsp;The final product is pretty faithful, given the constraints, to the film version, even employing the odd grey brick amongst the white to give it a battered and repaired-on-a-budget look.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I'm really happy that I was able to track this set down for a semi-reasonable price. &nbsp;The only thing that would make this better is a UCS tag and the stand with plaque. &nbsp;Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,5

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is big and solid.&nbsp; There are a dozen bags or so and they are not numbered.&nbsp; This was a huge pain.&nbsp; I spent the first 45 minutes emptying all the bags and sorting the contents into logical piles.&nbsp; Furthermore, when the instructions call for a white piece you have a pile of a out 1000 pieces to look through.&nbsp; This caused the build to take a very long time compared to the number of pieces in the kit.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are relatively standard.&nbsp; The radar dish is a nice uncommon piece.&nbsp; There are three modular capsule sections each with a top and bottom piece.&nbsp; These are very cool and can easily help to build a quick vehicle body when building custom sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Leia has the cinnabon hair -cool.&nbsp; Everything else - what you see is what you get.&nbsp; Nothing too flashy.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The core of the ship is very stable with a frame of long planks secured by technic pieces.&nbsp; The detail on the top of the ship is the best part of the kit.&nbsp; The engines are exquisite and model the actual design very closely.&nbsp; Kudos to the designer for matching the&nbsp;movie very closely.&nbsp; There are two escape pods that pull away nicely.&nbsp; The canopy of the main passenger section pulls up too easily.&nbsp; It simply rests on&nbsp;a few smooth pieces.&nbsp; I swapped one of the 1x2 smooth pieces for a regular 1x2 piece so that the canopy doesn&#39;t side around so much, so easy fix.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Build your own display stand and you have a gorgeous ship.&nbsp; It&#39;s not much to play with as the kit is unwieldy to hold or maneuver.&nbsp; Fantastic detail&nbsp;for a ship that is&nbsp;very difficult&nbsp;to replicate with Legos.</p>
