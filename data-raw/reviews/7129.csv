Pros:
Brickmaster exlusive
good peices
the idea was good
Yay, a partner for Mata Nui!

Cons:
Isn't it supposed to be purple?
Odd design, dosn't look like click

I do cherish the exlusive bionicles, but this one I think needed something more. I will be looking forward to the movie though.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-09-12T12:37:42.107Z","Click is here to save Mata Nui","Click has many good pieces. 
He is a life-size Scarab beetle.
He transforms into a Scarabax shield for Mata Nui. 
He is Mata Nui's first friend on Bara Magna. 
He has five little knives four are legs the other is the bottom part of his mouth
Two claws make his black mandibles
awesome

"Dragon_fire","2009-10-02T15:17:36.107Z","A neat little set","I got this set as a Preorder bonus with Bionicle: the legend reborn, and for what it is (which is a simple set made with limited pieces) it is brilliant

The build can be a bit fiddly at times, but it is a short build, so it doesn't matter

It has some good pieces in it if you like to make your own custom Bionicles, and works as a set on its own

The only problem I can think of with it is that it is very big compared with Mata Nui (Even the titan Mata Nui set), so playability in that respect is limited, but other than that, it is a neat little set to play with",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jonbuddy","2009-09-18T16:34:47.53Z","Well, it DOES look like a Beetle...","I'm not a Bionicle fan really, but when you get a Lego gift (except a girly one or Jack Stone) who can resist? :)

THE BUILD

The Ball joints are REALLY hard to snap together. That means once it's built, it's built. I like the big pieces to limit the tedious work of accidentaly putting the tiny ""one-dots"" on the wrong spot. Speaking of which, the ball joints that hold the legs CAN'T be put on wrong- Hooray! :D

THE PLAY

It is a nice ""desk model"" to absent-mindedly play with at your desk. If you don't have other real Bionicle sets, like me, it can always be a monster attacking Lego City. :P

OVERALL

Playability: 9/10
Build: 7/10
Detail: 8/10
Overall: 24/30 OR 8/10 OR 4/5

"GeorgeGilliatt","2009-10-04T02:34:10.78Z","Click","This set is good.I built it just before watching my copy of Bionicle The Legend Reborn. The model of click looks cooler than the one in the film because the film click dosn't look like a bionicle, but more like one o the characters from one of the old bionicle films

"LookOut21","2009-10-10T16:45:52.17Z","Very Cute!","Click is a very cute beetle! And a very good edition to any LEGO Bionicle collection! Here are the Pros & Cons on this set:

PROS
- Finally a Bionicle Brickmaster!
- Very nice design
- VERY cute!
- Very nice to pose & play!

CONS
- Legs always fall off

Overall, I give this set a 4.9/5! But soon you cant get a proven unopened model because soon you will only be able to get this on Ebay or Amazon. But anyways, this is worth it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"michaelvader","2009-11-29T09:47:26.967Z","This is a set thats not to well...fun.","I got this form brickmaster and its ok.

The build: The build is the best thing about this set! (Its always fun to build)! You also get alot of good MOCing parts. (I built a toa call caller out of parts form him and Skarll).

playing with it:This is the worst set to play with. Its to big to sit on Mata Nui's arm. And click IS NOT a big part of the story so I give this 3/5.

Not that good. If you asked me,I would go buy something else.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"jumper3485","2009-11-14T12:07:45.233Z","CLICK","I just got mine in the mail. He is kind of hard to stand. and when you stand it up you can't really have his digging claws down to the ground. besides that he's awesome. He's a good sized set. He's only good to play with if you play with others that are meant to be small or by its self.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-10T11:23:07.963Z","LEGO BIONICLE - BrickMaster - BIONICLE Review","Even if you're not a BIONICLE collector I think it's a great and valuable little set to add in any LEGO collection. This figure is very easy to build and we also don't get any stickers in this set. The legs, the claws and the head can be moved. But I think it's still a cool set and I'm sure that this figure will go up in value in 10 years. It's also a good set for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"james3426","2009-10-17T14:42:16.2Z","The Curious Scarabax","This is an okay set, but it has some flaws. The legs are scrunched together so he's hard to pose. His torso should have been longer so he would not have this issue. The moving pincers on the other hand, I think it looks good on him. The head is also well-designed and has two black Technic Cams, A piece hard to come by these days. Speaking of rare pieces, there is also a rare ""T"" Liftarm under the Vahki leg that connects it to the main torso.

                                                Pros:
                                           Rare pieces.
                                      Head is well-designed.
                               Moving pincers look good on him.

                                                Cons:
                        Legs are scrunched together and hard to pose
This is an okay set, but I only recommend it if you want the pieces or you are a collector.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
