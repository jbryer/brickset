<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Beautiful model, despite the small scale.<br></li><li>It's a good representation of the real building.<br></li><li>â€¦</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Lacking in size.<br></li><li>Somewhat pricey ($40 USD) for such a small model.</li></ul>The Guggenheim museum is a beautiful little model.<br>If you can manage to pick this set up at a discount, or are just an ardent FLW/architecture fan, than I'd recommend getting it. <br>It makes for a pleasant display piece.<br>
