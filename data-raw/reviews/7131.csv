I was disappointed with the other Architecture sets in that they did not offer enough detail - this set does not disappoint in that respect.  This set was challenging to assemble - and it is a bonus that the sections fit together to offer a chance to see inside the design and structural elements.  I hope that Lego continues this Architectural series - and with as much or more detail as shown in this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Be_Burger","2010-12-30T01:54:42.867Z","Fantastic Fallingwater","Fallingwater is an INCREDIBLE build for anyone, especially for Frank Lloyd Wright fans. Despite its $100 price tag, it is full of lots of extremely useful plates and tiles in tan, trans-clear, and a few in dark green and dark bluish gray too! It is extremely cleverly made and will impress anyone. You build it in levels so that you have the base, and then the different floors can slide out and in, but it is so well constructed that it is not fragile to move around. This is definitely a great set for any architecture fan, but, if you are looking for something more ""playable"", you should stick with a Creator house like others have mentioned, there are NO minifigures here, and not much to play with.<br><br>Overall, its a great set that anyone will love.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5

"Brickdroid","2012-11-17T19:09:22.2Z","A Beautiful Recreation of an Architectural Landmark","<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>If you don't want my entire, long winded review of Fallingwater, here you go: buy it. Now, onto the actual review. &nbsp;I have always been a fan of lego. &nbsp;The way that those wonderful little bricks click together just feels right to me. &nbsp;Of course, when I started building non-duplo sets at the age of 6, I was naturally attracted to themes like star wars and exo-force where I could recreate huge, epic battles of good and evil, and, when they were released, all of the Indiana Jones sets, where I could have my adventurer evade deadly traps and beat the bad guys to the treasure. &nbsp;The possibilities were endless! &nbsp;However, I started to like those sets less and less. &nbsp;By the time that I was 11, Exo-Force and Indiana Jones had been discontinued, and I'd noticed a decline in quality in the Star Wars sets. However, I don't think that they actually got worse. &nbsp;I just didn't love recreating those immense battles like I used to. &nbsp;My tastes were maturing, and, as if they read my mind, lego came out with the sets to match: the Architecture line. &nbsp; I got this set for Christmas and I got straight to work. &nbsp;For those who don't know, the set ""Fallingwater"" is a recreation of the famous architectural landmark of the same name. &nbsp;Did this set fill its huge, metaphorical shoes? Let's find out.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The box and instruction booklet really set the tone for the amount of quality that I could expect from this set. &nbsp;The box was extremely high quality, and was made so that you didn't have to rip it open to get all of your parts out. There was a tab that you only had to pull out, and the box would open like a book. &nbsp;Speaking of books, the instruction manual for this set was also extremely nice. The cover and the pages were made out of extremely nice paper, and crossed the border between ""instruction book"" and an actual book. &nbsp;In fact, the first few pages showed pictures of the actual building, and the architectural layouts for the building.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>There is very little to actually say about the parts. &nbsp;They are your standard tan, grey, green and transparent pieces, but they work very well for the set, and they could not have done better with any other pieces.</div><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: bold; "">Minifigures</span></p><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>There are no minifigures in ""Fallingwater"".</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The build was one of the more challenging that I have embarked on, mainly because of the lack of variety in the pieces. &nbsp;It get's very hard to discern one tan piece from the other, and if you make a mistake with a flat piece, they can be very hard to remove. &nbsp;Because of this lack of variety, you may want to play music during the build or you could get very bored.<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>There is only one word that properly describes this model: beautiful. It is currently sitting on my desk, and it looks absolutely fantastic. &nbsp;The use of the flat transparent pieces for the river makes it look stunning, especially under a light. &nbsp;Everything is perfect in terms of proportions, and aesthetically, this model just can't be beat. &nbsp;It is very simple, but very effective. &nbsp;Everything about this model is just <i>smooth.</i></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>If you want to get the basic gist of this whole summary, it's right here: <i style=""font-weight: bold; "">Fallingwater is amazing. &nbsp;</i>Everything about this model is perfect. &nbsp;The river, the windows, the shrubs on the lawn, the gravel in the riverbed, the bridge... It's just wonderful. &nbsp;It can't really be described. When you look at this set, you fell like you are IN Pennsylvania, looking at Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece. &nbsp;If you like beautiful lego sets, this MUST be in your collection.</div>",TRUE,5,3,4,1,5

<p style=""margin: 1em 0px; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Thankfully, the construction for the building itself is a little more engaging, largely due to the fact that you are finally constructing the actual building, and while there is no advanced techniques used here (SNOT, etc...), it is interesting to finally see the *trick* which is employed in the last few steps of the construction. &nbsp;[I hadn&#39;t read any spoilers so I won&#39;t offer any either...]</p>

<p style=""margin: 1em 0px; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Suffice it to say that the construction process is a bit boring and employs a lot of the same simple parts and techniques, but it was still fun to complete.</p>
