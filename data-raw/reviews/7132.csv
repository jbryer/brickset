Lego litterally improved every flaw of the origanal. There are no flimsy turrets, but instead, clear studs. The bulkyness has been eliminated and instead, the set is thin and sleek. It is possible to close the doors by switching around the panels, but the effect really isn't worth the hassal. The best fact is that it is exactly accurate to its big brother. 

Pros:
Very accurate to its bigger model
Improved in every sense
New grey joystick peices

Cons:
Too small compared to other minis
The cannons are too squated over the wings and gives the top a flat appearance",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Curious, I pulled up Ebay and checked out some of the neat little models from previous months. I noticed that they were offering a Star Wars lego model that month that looked very cool, so we signed up immediately. Shortly after signing up (within a week) we received this great little model. The model itself is built quite solidly and can stand up to rough play. The size is perfect for swooping about, carrying around wherever you wish to go. Doors can be set to opened or closed. The cockpit lifts up and down. Overall, a pretty nice, basic, well-designed Star Wars mini lego set that looks great and is fun to play with.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5
