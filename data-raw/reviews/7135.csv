Np picture can explain how shiny it is, it reall refelcts Darth Vader on teh movies.

"MandalorianCandidate","2009-05-29T17:26:38.95Z","Chromalicious","Obviously, packages with the bonus Vader are going to weigh more, but is the weight significant enough to register on a flimsy food scale?  This was the tough question I asked myself while fiddling around with my collection the other day.  I bought three clone packs but hadn’t opened them up yet.  Sure enough, one of them deflected the needle a hair (a really skinny hair!) more than the other two.  Sure enough, there was a Vader inside.

I think getting the Vader was more exciting than the actual figure…but that doesn’t mean I’m giving him up either.  It’s pretty much the same Vader we’ve gotten in the past, but the minifig head is updated, probably the same as the new Death Star and TIE Fighter sets.  The lightsaber hilt is also chrome plated, like we were getting before the ROTS movie line in 2005.

It looks like just the helmet and the torso are chrome-ish, not the same as the chrome C-3PO but it has a metallic gleam just the same.

Definitely a nice pack-in, but not worth the crazy prices people have been getting off ebay sales.

construction - 10/10 (looks like DV to me)
design/sturdiness - 10/10 (unless you stick it into a hydraulic press)
comparison to movie - 10/10 (he may not be made of chrome, but his helmet is shiny!)
swoosh factor - N/A (OK, I never saw him fly in the movies)
reviewer's tilt - 10/10 (thanks for the freebie, Lego!)

"baylego","2009-06-18T09:46:07.733Z","The Jewel Minifig ","I got this when I won a building competition at the lego store. After I opened the package and built him, he was amazing. The lightsaber was a matte silver finish, but the lightsaber finish comes of after a while of taking the lightsaber in and out of a figs hands. This wont be a problem if youre a collector, though. The chrome finish on vader is resilient, though, and stays on after wear and tear. The chrome is not too shiny, but not too subtle, and allows vader to retain his color and still shine. The chrome job was perfect everywhere, exept for the bottom of the feet. At least you dont see that part usually.

     When he was in the bag, it was as light as a feather, so be sure you have a nice scale if you plan weighing boxes. Its worth no more than $25.00 USD in my opinion. If you are a die hard collector, and must have it, than it is worth it. if you dont want to spend most of the outrageous bids on ebay, or dont have a scale, it wont be too important to miss, but grab it at any assured opportunity that you will get it. Be sure to grab a chrome stormtrooper if you miss this one, though. It is one of the best figs made, and deserves a 6/5! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BioFreak877","2009-06-08T06:33:32.2Z","I am Chrome!","I got this set through an offer at Toys 'R' Us in Warrington about a week ago. I was really excited getting this and it is now a priceless treasure in my Lego collection.
I wouldn't really call it a Chrome Darth Vader because it's really just very shiny. I doubt Lego would actually spend the money on a real semiprecious metal to give away to customers for free. I'm not trying to put Lego down, but it is probably true.
All in all, I think that this is a very good addition to any Lego Star Wars fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"akerh001","2009-07-17T12:34:30.153Z","im soooooo lucky to own this","let me start by saying that this figure is THE BEST i own
i won it from my local lego shop in milton keynes today (the 17th of july 2009) through a speed building contest and was amazed at its glory when he was in my possesion. 
although i have kept it in the bag it came in ,to stare at with amasment, i realy adore it , it is a rare black crome colour and shines whith movement the hilt is a different colour than its usual crome silver but still looks shiny.
the face is slightly different from my other vaders as it is more detailed,and serios.
the capre blade and helmet are all the same but the helmet is crome also.
penultimatley the torso has a nice set of buttons and switches as vader does but again these are more detailed

finaly i would like to say that now matter how ,try to get your hands on one  you wont regret it .  
i give this set a
pefect 10

Lego makes about 1000 of these and the prices are jacked up for a minifigure! Is this a joke or is it that most Lego Star Wars already have a Darth Vader minifig? I don't need another Vader minifig.

I just spent 250 and didn't get one. But then a ton of people get them by buying battle packs. It's just really unfair.

"MeesterYellow","2019-08-12T19:43:30.16Z","The Perfect Minifig!","<p>Darth Vader was and is always my favourite villain and character since I was a kid, and always wanted the Chrome Darth Vader after finding out about it through YouTube around back when YouTube first came out but could not have afford it and wasn&#39;t lucky enough to get one through the 10,000 Chrome Darth Vaders inserted in random 2009 sets promotion then.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m working full time, I was able to finally afford and acquire it this year. I found a good deal on one on eBay for $60 USD in great condition and bought it; being able to acquire my white whale at last.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After receiving it, I can now say that it looks amazing and it&#39;s perfect! The chrome black paint goes very well with the already well designed minifig (imo). Almost every thing here is exclusive to this set. Only minor negative is not having the cape and lightsaber hilt chrome (quite ironic) but the pros outweigh it. Luckily, the seller included a red lightsaber with a chrome hilt. Overall, I love this minifig!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This minifig is perfect for my display and stands out the most out of all my minifigs on display!&nbsp;</p>
