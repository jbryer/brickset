"baylego","2009-06-11T11:36:47.077Z","Good Game","This game is not my favorite game, but id much better than some others ive played.  Ill break the game down into the points.

       It is a civilization-styled game, that is more about strategy then fighting. I was not suprised that the cpu fought my players, knowing it was a strategy game. Some might be suprised, though. Each ""act"" is compromised of several levels, so dot freak out if youre not able to play the other sides upon completing the first level. The game is nicely detailed, and there are a lot of play abilities. There is also room for two profiles, so you and somebody else can have one.

    In the ""store"", you can buy concept art, unhelpful help hints, enter codes, buy maps, and buy new charachters. The concept art is very cool, and is the first thing you should spend studs on. The Story section of the game is enormous, and will provide hours of play. Free play is fun, because you can pit ancient knights against futuristic aliens. there is also a feature to play over Wi-FI.

    I dont think anything needs to be said about the graphics except 1 word: horrid. I think that lego could of put a little more TLC into this, but it is still fun, so I give this a 4/5.

"Generalstaal","2009-08-12T15:51:44.263Z","Very Fun","I got this game whilst on Holiday in Florida, for $30 (which is pretty good, considering its Â£30 in Britain, and the Pound is worth more than the Dollar). 
I think it is a Very Good Game, so I will go through the Pros and Cons

Pros:
Very Fun and Addictive
Loads of Levels in 6 Unlockable Campaigns (King, Pirate, Space, Wizard, Governer Broadside, and Aliens)
90 Unlockable Characters
A Free Play Mode, where you can build your own army
A Hero Character for every campaign, that has their own Special Attacks
Red Bricks, and minikit!!

Cons:
Bad Graphics (Although, I don't mind it)
Sometimes gets boring

Overall, this is a Very Good game, and a must buy",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Star_Wars_Geek","2009-10-08T16:55:41.873Z","The Best Lego Game!","First I must say it is perfect, I want to keep this short.

     Pros
     90 Levels, Awesome
     Most original figures
     Ninjas, dwarves, trolls, islanders, space criminals, space police.
                
     Cons
     Knight's kingdom king
     Earth story starts you with Gemma, not the guy next to the king 
     on the cover, Biff.(no offense)
                
     Ignoring the cons which I do,  I give it a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Darthleapyous","2009-11-21T05:01:43.873Z","i cant bear the awesomeness!","This is a awesome game,it has knights ,skeletons , dwarfs and trolls for the castle stories.Pirates,imperials,ninjas and islanders for the pirate stories.astronauts,aliens,space criminals and space police for the astronaut stories.It is not like lego indiana jones or star wars where you move with your control pad,you use the ds stylus and tap on the touch screen,then your character walks to the  place where you've taped.There are these special characters called heros,they can cast different magin tricks on the battle field,the heros are the king,the wizard,the troll king , the dwarf king,sorcerous,queen,captain brickbeard,lady pirate, king kahuka,governor broadside,camila,ninja master,gemma,biff,space police captain,alien commander,alien queen and space criminal leader.I have completed the alien,king,imperial and wizard stories.The cutscenes are HILARIOUS!here are the pros and cons:

pros:
castle story
pirates story
space story
heros
really fun
awesome characters

cons:
the troll king doesn't look like the one in trolls mountain fortress,he doesn't have a cape,he has a helmet instead of a crown,he has a normal troll torso instead of the unique one and his eye isn't missing

no troll sorcerous
is sometimes really hard

the good king is not like the one in the set,he has a white beard instead of a orange one,he doesn't have the armour and he has a archers torso

overall:
this is a really good game if you see it get it(if you have the money).It would be cool if there was a LEGO battles 2 and it could have power miners and agents stories.

Thank you for reading my review!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
