Its identifiable as a simple but attractive farm scene and therefore playing as older kids remains fun when your younger sibling appreciates it so much.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4>[<b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div>One sideways glancing, grinning farmer in a grey hat.</div><div><br><div><b>Barn Dance</b></div></div><div>It is a dusty looking scene that includes a windmill which is great for action and small hands. The animals; a horse, a sheep, a pig, a chicken and a rooster, are simple but very likeable characters for the farmer to chase around, catch and then place in a pen. The moulds on these are smooth and good for small hands as is much of the Duplo range. While spanning a short term in play for a toddler, the development toward bigger things is probably very worthwhile.</div><div><br></div><div>That pen is a set of fences in brown that connect together with unfortunately easily broken clips if your child is a little boisterous or rough in play. The wagon or cart is fun and bright to transport the animals, strangely towed by the Horse's tail?! The fun part here is taking as many animals to market as possible. Stacking them all only goes so far and its possibly a shame that only one stud was atop each animal rather than two but this enables a central riding position for Duplo people, yes even on the sheep and pig!</div><div><br></div><div>A wonderful farm yard, this set was well loved in our household and is probably a great expansion to the larger set&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=045-1"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=045-1</a>&nbsp;because it has an alternative coloured horse. Otherwise its worth going for the full hoedown set so your toddler gets a proper farm. All very good and simple fun sets.</div>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,3
