Simple, because of the parts, you may check out a photo of the parts inventory at my blog and you may agree with me:

The 1x1 tiles alone are quite costly, especially the green ones, believe it or not, someone is selling it at more than USD 2 per piece!

And the three Robots are quite cute indeed! I have set them up for some fun photos!

It is worth buying as a souvenir item, the parts themselves are worth the money, plus you can play the game if you have young kids at home.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
