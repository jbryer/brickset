However there are several varations on the basic theme that start to make it last longer and much more interesting. We particularly liked the 'create your own recipe and hide it' version.<br/><br/>You are positively encouraged to change the game and the rules so we had a go at that and managed to add a few more twists to it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>+ Excellent gameplay<br/>+ nice pieces, lots of bright colours<br/>+ Doesn't take long to play, ideal for just before bedtime :-)<br/>+ A lot of scope for variations of the rules<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>- The basic game can be over in a matter of minutes<br/><br/>I lok forward to playing this game again, and, on the strength of it, others in the range.<br/>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

The game looks complex but when you get the idea its the most simple thing to play in the world. The box is really cool and the image on the front looks fantastic. To give it a five and for it to become a perfect set it should come with the two minifigs on the box.

Love this set could be better hours of fun. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The game concept is very simple; Put the owl on the row/column that you intend to take an object from, and roll the dice to see what you actually get to take. Despite having such a simple concept, I found a lot of enjoyment out of this game; It's a test of luck and&nbsp;strategy! One thing I will say is that this works better with 3 players (rather than two) The game only takes ~5 minutes to play.<div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
