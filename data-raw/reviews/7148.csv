"jmenomeno","2009-08-09T02:34:07.077Z","Fun for everyone!","I got this as a sorta advance set (for the US) and am pretty impressed.

The game is a variant of a Connect 4 game, where players line up 4 of their monsters on the board. To make things interesting, there are a couple of random elements that are used in the game - a spider that clears a quadrant fof the board, and skeletons that can be any player's monsters.

As a game, this is pretty neat - it's simple in setup but becomes as complex as the strategy. Set up for two to four players, this is a game that shines when it's maxed out. Two is fun, but four makes the game much more challenging!

The build is pretty easy, and the parts that are worth note are the minifig heads - the red devils are unique, as well as the brown werewolves. A new part is a 1x1 round plate with open center, which can be seen in the spider's eyes. The coolest part, though, is the dice. It has a nice bounce to it in play and can be customized to who knows what.

I played this with some AFOLs and then with a family that had TFOLs, and all of them really enjoyed the game - it was neat to watch the family, as here it was evident that the family game angle was fulfilled by Monsters 4! 

The set is selling for about 16 USD in the UK, so the price is pretty reasonable. Aas a parts pack, it's a little expensive, but as a game it's a good buy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The actual game itself is a type of connect 4. The goal is to place 4 of the heads in a row and that person wins. The skeleton skulls can be used for anyone and the spider clears a quadrant. I played this with my family while I was home on a break and they seemed to enjoy it outright as a game, as none of them have any interest in LEGO. The game also comes with some alternate rules and also encourages the player to make up their own rules as well.</p>
<p>The game also comes with a very nifty 6 sided dice. On each side of this dice there are 2x2 of studs, which as one could imagine are very useful for the game. You actually have to make the dice yourself by putting the specific bricks on each side of the dice. This is also where the instructions encourage you to mix up the rules for the game, as you can sub out the pieces on the dice and put whatever you would like there.</p>
<p>The spider is a neat little creation. The only truly significant bit to notice is that the 1x1 circular studs that are used for the eyes have holes in them, which could be useful for other creations outside of the game. The game comes with 3 of these, one being extra.</p>
<p>What is truly amazing about this game is probably the sheer amount of heads that it comes with. There are 4 skeleton heads (the type from the Castle line with the red bulging eyes,) 4 wolf heads (which to my knowledge are unique to this set, the only other wolfhead not being circular,) 4 troll heads (not unique,) 4 pumpkin heads (which are not unique to this set as well and work well just as pumpkins in their own right,) and 4 what I call 'devil' heads (which are unique to this set.) This comes out to a total of 20 heads. If you are a person who likes to customize their minifigures with different head pieces and such I would highly recommend this set to you. Unique heads and the quantity of heads make this set very attractive.</p>
<p>The difficulty in building is hardly none at all. You can build it easily without instructions. There are no baseplates included in this set. This fact confused me because the green plates that the graveyard is on come out to be a quarter of a baseplate.</p>
<p>One final note is that on the box of the game there is a vampire playing a troll, but there are no vampire heads. This doesn't detract from the set itself but it just confused me as to why they would include the vampire over a devil character or a wolf man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased this set for $15 US dollars at a LEGO store and I would highly recommend it to those interested in having a fun game with tons of variability and to those who would like some LEGO heads. </p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"meyerc13","2011-04-03T11:55:44.407Z","My first and favorite LEGO Game (so far!)","<p>This was one of my first LEGO games, and it is still my favorite out of the five games I own.&nbsp; Which better to cover as my first review of a LEGO game.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The boxes that LEGO includes with these games are very sturdy.&nbsp; Even better, in most cases you can leave the set assembled when you put it back in the box... this is one of those cases.<br><br>The sets include two instruction books, one to build the set, and one to play the game.&nbsp; The game instructions come in multiple languages, so don't get scared when you see how big that book is.<br><br>One of the best features of LEGO games is they encourage you to change the games and create your own rules.&nbsp; They also include some sample changes that you can make, so your only limits are your own imagination.&nbsp; I almost wish LEGO included some space in the rule book to write your own house rules (hint hint LEGO).<br><h4>Parts</h4>The LEGO company is very crafty.&nbsp; They know that some people will buy a set for the set, while others will buy a set for the parts.&nbsp; I haven't seen a lot of discussion about LEGO games as a source for parts, but I bought a second copy of this set because I think it is a great parts pack.&nbsp; <br><br>First, you get lots of interesting mini-fig heads.&nbsp; Wolf men, skeletons, pumpkin heads... you get a total of 20 heads in this set!&nbsp; Second, you get some decently sized green plates, enough to build a 16x16 board.&nbsp; I'm not sure why LEGO didn't include a 16x16 baseplate as they have with some other LEGO games, but I'm not complaining because I need plates!&nbsp; In fact, I swapped out the plates in my main set for a 16x16 baseplate.&nbsp; Another useful part in this set is the jumper plates in two shades of gray.&nbsp; I can never have enough of these.&nbsp; <br><h4>Minifigures</h4>There aren't really minifigs, but there are minifig heads and the ones included in this set are fairly rare and very useful. I'm sure that people who love minifigs will love having these heads for Halloween projects and haunted houses.<h4>The build</h4>The build for most of these LEGO games is fairly quick and straightforward.&nbsp; You can certainly disassemble the game after each play, but you don't have to and I don't.&nbsp; Once this game is assembled, you realize that it could have been a non-LEGO game as well, which isn't the case for every LEGO game, some of which are built as you play.<h4>The game play</h4>So you assemble the game, now it is time to play. As others have pointed out, this game is a bit like Tic Tac Toe, a bit like Connect Four.&nbsp; What it is is tons of fun.&nbsp; My 3 and 5 year old kids love the spider, having their pieces run screaming when the spider invades their quarter of the board.&nbsp; The skeletons can be wild cards, or you can change the rules to have them block.&nbsp; I've found the game is lots of fun to play for our family of four, as I said above so far it is our favorite.<h4>Summary</h4>In summary I can't recommend this game enough.&nbsp; If you want to give a LEGO game a try, start with this one.&nbsp; Even if you don't like the game, you'll have some good pieces to add to your collection.&nbsp; The LEGO dice are especially interesting.&nbsp; If you do like the game, watch out, because soon you'll find yourself with half a dozen.&nbsp; Some are better than others, but we love playing all the LEGO games we've bought so far.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"AETerry","2010-10-29T14:51:11.62Z","Monsters 4 Review","<p>I must be the only one who's come to this game expecting a little more and was disappointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the layout is easy to build and the play is simple enough. The spider was fun to build despite my daughter's protest that its scary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of todate, 4 months after buying the game, I haven't been able to get anyone willing to play so I haven't properly tested it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for pieces... I've been able to console myself over having lots of parts and extra head pieces for customization.</p>",TRUE,3,5,3,3,3
