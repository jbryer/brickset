"sonjecka","2009-12-31T13:10:03.547Z","Simple but Great","This is one of four LEGO game I have.

It is very easy for play, but very interesting, tensely and strategically minded.  
Each game is always different and funny because competitors building die during game.

They comes with 4 micro-figures (red,blue,yellow and white)

Dragon standing on the top and waiting for the winner who will ride.  
It is special pleasure to throw the opponent with the stick that represents lava.

Enjoy the game is not too expensive, but very addictive.

"Boidoh","2011-01-06T20:38:35.82Z","Ahhh, Lava!!","<p>I got this set for my birthday today and i am rather please&nbsp;with it. When i look at this i thought it was gonna be awesome, and it was. I will explain all the cool stuff in the following review.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box first of all is great. It shows when your finished playing you can take pieces apart and put it inside. The instructions were very clear except for the part where you put the lava piece seemed confusing.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts are mostly filled by 1x1 plates and lava pieces. Also a new type of minifigure i ever so like, THE MICROFIGURES! Its also nice to have those dragon pieces so you can have one if your making a kingdom.</p>
<h4>Microfigures</h4>
<p>Awesome, Great, Fantastic, Any thing cool. This comes with not 1, nor 2, not even three but FOUR! Even though this is for playing it can be put in a city. Like for a volcano or soemthing. I used these microfigures in my city.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Its a really simple build but eh its just a game board ur building. The bottom of the lava dragon volcano seems very unstable. I also wonder whats with the dragon with no real mouth?</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>Great, Terrific, Its a game, aint it? You get to play with&nbsp;4 players and get to change rules. I although dont really like the one where you can knock them back to the start, its quite annoying as getting orange is quite easy. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Get this, its great. I got it for my birthday and i saw the price here on brickset and its a decent price. To repeat: 4 MicroFigs, 1 Dragon and a Game Board.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

If you get it, I'd recommend using it for pieces.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
