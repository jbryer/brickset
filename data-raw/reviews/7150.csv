"kurttkrueger","2009-08-03T11:44:44.95Z","Great game, and highly competitive!","When I heard Lego was producing a range of board games I was quite pleased. I'm a long time Lego fan, but find board games boring, and my wife doesn't understand my love for Lego, but loves board games. So here, we have a fusion of both our interests. The results? Hours of happy gaming. 

The build itself is fairly repetitive, but doesn't take long to complete. Also, it comes supplied with a handy card template, so resetting the board is simple, although it can be stored away in the box fully built. 

The parts selection is nice, with bold, striking colour scheme. The microfigs are also fun, and suprisingly detailed. 

On the back of the box, the concept of the game itself seems overly simple, but once played, this game becomes very tactical. Players need to move at least two of their pieces into their corresponding central colour to win the game. Depending on what they roll, players may elect to move a piece, move a wall, or control the minotaur. 

I introduced this to my parents while visiting them recently, so got to try it out with four players. Much fun, and competition I might add, was had. 

With the addition of some extra rules included, you can ramp up the difficulty, and challenge level of the game. 

In conclusion, I'm very impressed with Minotarus, and will definatley be picking up more games in the range. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"paulsalley","2009-08-10T22:07:00.903Z","Very enjoyable to play","My wife and i played this for the first time last night and overall found it very enjoyable.  We played Ramses Pyramid as well, and although the Pyramid game is getting all the hype, we found this one much more entertaining.

Older players will probably find it to easy played with the standard rules, but Lego make good suggestions to ramp up the difficulty to make the game last longer.

The game is very quick to set up, (build) and once complete can be stored made up, (the Pyramid took twice as long to build, but can also be stored made up).

Overall a very good game for all the family, simple enough for children to understand, entertaining enough for adults to enjoy.

"darth_brickius","2009-08-22T12:32:35Z","one of the best","so far this is the only lego board game i have and i am very pleased with it i have had friends and family all playing (even my grandmother) and they all enjoyed it

it is very easy to assemble and can be stored in the box fully built which is very useful

the gameplay is fun and competitive and the extra rules are very interesting

the dice and micro-figures are very good and easy to use 

i can not really see any major cons at all

a very good game well done lego",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>A lot of pieces are included, with a basic rule set that is easy for young kids to learn quickly (my son is 6 and thought it was too easy!) and some cool little micro-figs. The rules can be changed, and adapted, to suit your taste and this only adds to the playability and longivity. Coming up with new maze layouts and rules keep us coming back for more! Try adding extra elements from your 'spares' box and see what happens.</p>
<p>Fantastic game.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

We played this one first and it's still my favorite of the first 4 (Pirate Code, Monsters, Dragon's Liar being the others).

"alva","2010-12-21T01:02:34.063Z","Another game for kids","I bought this set along with the Ramses set, cause they both are the biggest among other board games that lego launch that year.<br>I really expected something fun and enjoyable when I bought this set cause I like boardgame and I love playing Lego, so combining the two will create double fun for me.<br>The building proccess is quite fun. The minotaurs is build from bricks and parts, and look really cool eventhough it is quite simple design.<br>But coming to the playing phase, I just cant enjoy it as much.<br>The game is just so-so. I think this is because I am adult, and this game actually intended for kids.<br>I think the game is quite lame for adults.<br><br>If you happens to have kids in the house, go grab this set. I think it will really turn up lots of nights in your home.<br>But if you want to buy it for display purpose only, do not do it. The board look quite plain and boring.<br>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,3

"Elwood","2011-01-04T13:11:04.167Z","The Most Playable Lego game","<p>I have played all the lego games and this has to be a clear favourite. We have had some epic games of this in the office! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The board is really simple to build and unlike some of the other lego games has lots of ways to change the gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am 29 and have played it with my collegues, my girlfriends niece is 10 and she asked for it for Christmas. It really is a game that can be played by the whole family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with all the other Lego Games the key to sucess is the brilliant interchangable dice, which once you have... the more creative among us could create their own games using their lego collections!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The characters are fantastic, and I would thouroughly recommend this as a 'value for money' game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, in Toys R Us UK stores there are really cool instructional videos linked to a barcode scanner on Lego Games. Well worth a look.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"J_H","2011-12-30T01:01:43.623Z","Great Game, with hours of playablility, just be careful what rules you change","<p>H is 5 and his Grandparents bought this for him.&nbsp; The set up/ build was easy and fun, and the game play was simple, but able to be enjoyed by both of us and Grand parents.&nbsp; check out other game based reviews on http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41835/minotaurus<br></p>

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Allowing a 5 yo set rules that make a 10min game last upto an hour.&nbsp; be careful what you change!<br></li></ul>

"Brickdarg","2022-01-30T22:44:24.527Z","A pretty fun board game","<p>This is a pretty simple and fun board game that&#39;s a fair bit of fun with friends. It&#39;s not the most groundbreaking game ever, but&nbsp;it&#39;ll entertain for a few matches. The microfigures included are nice and the easy customization means you can have a new map every time you play. Lego board games are sometimes hit and miss, but this one is a solid enough hit.</p>
