"emraldtiger789","2013-07-05T14:31:03.977Z","RACE 3000: Great LEGO Game worth buying","<p>This is my first review on Brickset. I received this set as a gift a while back and wanted to review a LEGO game, so&nbsp;I chose this because its an enjoyable fun game that's worth writing about.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The top of the&nbsp;box can come off of the bottom, so that you can fit the game in it.&nbsp;Inside the box&nbsp;are as follows: Two baseplates,&nbsp;unnumbered bags, two instruction booklets. and one&nbsp;LEGO dice. The first instruction booklet is for how to build the game, and has twenty pages. The second instruction booklet is for playing the built game, and comes in three languages.</p><p><strong>Parts</strong></p><p>The parts are pretty good. The flat baseplates are a solid foundation for MOCs, there are a boatload of 1x2, 1x4, and 1x6 grey bricks, and the LEGO dice is there as always in a LEGO Games set. It also comes with&nbsp;a lot of 1x1 tiles, and some recolored telephone pieces.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There were supposed to be&nbsp;four&nbsp;racer minifigures, but they couldn't fit in the tiny race cars; So they went to a real racecourse to watch a real race.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The course is simple and repetitive, but the race cars are superb! I didn't know that telephones could fit that way... The dice however, is built as the game progresses.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is a tad plain, but the game play is exactly like a race. The LEGO company did well on this one and it did what it was meant to do, to turn&nbsp;a pile of plastic toys into an enjoyable game that you can play over and over and&nbsp;over.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In conclusion, RACE 3000 is a fun game that's well worth your money spent. the only downsides&nbsp;are that it's a pain to get the tiles off the dice, the trophy is too simple for me, and the fact that you can lose the game.&nbsp;It is easy to learn how to play the game, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;would highly&nbsp;recommend buying this for yourself, or a friend.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"alfred_the_buttler","2018-12-17T05:39:46.483Z","Really fun board game for younger kids","<p>As a Lego set, this set is fairly boring, unless you really want some smaller base plates and a bunch of colored phone bricks. Obviously from looking at the picture you can see it is a very simple build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed game board actually falls apart fairly easily. The two baseplates&nbsp;are barely connected,&nbsp;my 5 year old realized if you put the podium across the two plates it makes it slightly stronger. Also the bricks that make up the track come off very easily when&nbsp; you pick up your car to move it. So as a Lego set, I would say it is pretty poorly designed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But if you view this as a game it is great. The game is nowhere near as good as a classic board game like Candyland&nbsp;or newer ones like Monopoly Jr, but because it is made out of Legos your kids will love it. The fact that you build the dice as you play is a really cool concept and really fun for kids. It&rsquo;s also nice that everyone can potentially move their car on every turn and not just their own turn. The track is a little too long, but luckily you&rsquo;ll be rolling oranges a lot as well as yellow. I don&rsquo;t really understand the two tracks since you can jump other cars with no penalty for them- obviously this could be a rule change. However to keep things simple for my 5 year old, I&rsquo;ve told him that you can&rsquo;t go over the black oil slicks, which requires him to think ahead when he gets to an orange spot so that he goes to the correct side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game is definitely designed for kindergarteners, and I have the feeling that older kids might get bored with it, but of course that is when you need to start changing the rules a bit more. But if your little one loves Legos&nbsp;and board games, there is nothing better than this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
