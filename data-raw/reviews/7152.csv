"BIONICLEGuy","2009-12-28T03:24:39.98Z","Amazing, but the instructions?","I got this set for Xmas this year, the game & pieces are amazing but the instructions tell you nothing.
They just help you put the microfigs & robots in place & you have to do the rest without instructions.
Onto pros & cons!

Pros-
The game is really fun.
Rare pieces.
Good microfigs.

Cons-
The instructions tell you nothing.
The model is pretty hard to build.

Overall, I would recommend this set to someone who actually wants it & will have fun with it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pieces of the set are cool and as a built set looks very good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only problem is that the games rules seem to do too much. You score points for building space stations with different parts, you have to move robots or spacemen back to your station, you then score point for getting them back to your scoring zone whilst your spaceman move a step closer to the space ship! I am sorry if this sounds confusing, but it's because it IS! The intructions are dubius too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the beautiful thing with Lego Games is... You can change the rule to suit you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you already have Space Lego try adding it to you set and make the game more interesting.</p>
