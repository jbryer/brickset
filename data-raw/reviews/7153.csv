I like playing memory game, this is a good example of one!

the micro-figs are great (you can use them as lego-action figures for the normal lego figures)

I have allways been a fan of lego scorpians, this game comes with two one black and one gold coloured (the gold one is hidden in the pyramid)

All together its a great items for people who like Lego and games.


A good practical use for lego!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"paulsalley","2009-08-15T11:33:24.217Z","Not sure what the hype is about","I bought this game after reading good reports, and as a result of it winning awards.  My wife and I, (both in our 30's) have tried to play it twice since, but given up on both occassions without either of us finishing the game.  On both occassions, it seems you quickly get to a stage were there weren't many options on how to move.  

It states in the instructions you need to decide if you want to through the dice, or rotate around the pyramid, you have to decide before you through.  I kept finding myself in the posistion were I couldn't go to any other side of the pyramid because I couldn't produce the right colour crystal, however when I threw the dice, I didn't have the required colour to go up either.  

I had removed the green and purple crystals as per the instructions for a 2 player game prior to playing.  I ended up going around the bottom again a few times to try and get access to more colour crystals, but quite quickly got fed up of not seeming to progress.

Overall neither my wife or I was impressed with this.  Fortunately we bought the Minotaur game at the same time, which is a lot better.

I read and re read the instructions several times, (which are very basic) thinking I might be missing something obvious, but I don't think I have.  Definately try before you buy!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"alva","2011-02-22T00:56:25.963Z","Lego should review their way of entering the Board Game Market","At first I thought that when Lego launched their Board Game Series, it will be really fun to play with. I mean I am a Lego lover and a Board game lover as well, so combining two of them should create something that double loveable, right?<br>That is my logic until I got my hand on the pyramid.<br><br>I bought this one, not the other board games since this set is designed by Reiner Knizia and get a Toy Innovation award, so I was thinking that this is the best game board that produced by Lego.<br><br>Opened the box and find a lot of interesting parts in this set. Lots of emeralds, some scorpions, and a 32x32 tan baseplate. Lovely. The dice is really unique in design. And the microfig? Really cute, like a baby minifig.<br>And the building proccess itself is fun.<br><br>But after finished building, come the main reason of buying the set. The playing time.<br>And that was when I found out that this set not so good.<br>Tried to read the manual over and over, and still can not understand the rules completely. Tried to play it with some friends, and we got bored after half an hour of playing.<br><br>The game play is really simple, very straight forward without tactics or anything.<br><br>I think this set and other Lego board game is really intended for kids and for kids only, so it really wont suited for adults.<br><br>Hoping so much that Lego can create a more complex and more interesting board game that specifically intended for their adult market next time.<br><br>For now, I kept myself away from all Lego board game.<br><br>",TRUE,2,4,3,2,2
"asteciuc","2010-06-28T16:26:08.903Z","Simple Yet Complex Play Style","I received this set yesterday as a birthday gift from a friend who knows how enthusiastic about LEGO I am. Having bought the Monster 4 game previously and being very happy with it (not only in gameplay but the pieces that came with it) I had high hopes for Ramses Pyramid and I was not disappointed. <br><br>The goal of the game is simple: Get to the top of the pyramid. Once there you face off with Ramses for his crown and all of his treasure inside of the pyramid. Simple goals are always the best in board games. The complexity comes from how you play the game.<br><br>The first step of the game is have your adventurer move around the base of the pyramid. While you are doing this you collect crystals of different colors which will come in handy while scaling the pyramid. You also have the option to look under the little dark tan domes to see what color crystal is there and use your knowledge of that later in the game. You proceed doing this until you have circled around the pyramid once.<br><br>Once you are on the pyramid you must get to the top and then face off against Ramses, and if you roll a certain side of the dice against him, then you win the game. While you do this though you must watch out for the mummies that descend the pyramid once a certain side of the dice is rolled. If you a mummy descends onto your level then you are knocked off onto the bottom of the pyramid.<br><br>In order to ascend the pyramid you must either have the correct color crystal that is on the side and level of the pyramid you are ascending or guess which dark tan dome houses the correct color crystal. If you manage to complete one of these two requirements you may ascend the pyramid.<br><br>Another aspect of the game that I had no idea about until I started playing (despite reading the rules, this just seemed to get lost in there) is that you can also pick up and rotate the pyramid to your advantage or to the other player's disadvantage, further adding another layer of complexity to the game. <br><br>I played this two times through with my friend. We are both in our early 20's and we had a pretty good blast. The game time says 30-40 minutes and even with two people this took 33 minutes to complete. The build time takes a while as well as everything has to be spaced correctly and set up but luckily (and due to good design) you can simply take off the top three layers of the pyramid and keep the game in the box. <br><br>If you are simply looking to buy this set for the pieces then I recommend a green light on that endeavor. The tan baseplate is not seen in any other sets except for The Grand Emporium at the moment and some other modular sets. The 'crystals' are always nice to have and the dark gray dome pieces are nice and come in copious amounts, as do tan bricks in this set. The microfigures will be a great addition to any collectors set and can double as quite a few other items in the LEGO world (Action Figure, Statue, decorations). I suspect that they will be most valuable to people who build on a mini scale for people. As a note, none of the microfigures come apart AT ALL. They are all one piece.<br><br>I recommend this game for all and recommend that you play with more than two people.<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"Dragon_Master_48","2013-12-04T23:49:50.217Z","It's a Good Game, I Suppose","<p>Ever since I have owned this set, I've always been intending to review it, but I haven't felt as if it would be good to review it only as a set, and not as a game as well. Now that my family and I have finally played the game, I feel as if I can accurately review it both as a set and as a board game.</p><p>For this review, I will be doing a different style, analyzing some aspects as a set, and others as a game, as one would expect from this type of set.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Set: The wide baseplate allows for customization.</li><li>Set: Both the inside and outside of the pyramid are interesting.</li><li>Set: Microfigures are cool-looking.</li><li>Set/Game: Pyramid breaks apart for easy storage</li><li>Game: Game is easily modified if you don't like the ""default"" one.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Set: Pyramid is overall sturdy, but the layers may fall apart if you're not too careful.</li><li>Set: Miniature structures outside the pyramid (I think they're supposed to be temples?) look uninteresting and out of place; they could have easily been made a tiny bit larger.</li><li>Set: Building the pyramid is a terrible experience, especially if you're building this set for the first time.</li><li>Game: Game is rather boring, at least in my opinion, but it's easily modified to the players' preferences.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I find this set to be a rather unique set, and even quite an enjoyable experience, once everything (building, planning the game, etc.) is said and done. Although I feel as if the set could have been a bit larger and more ""showy,"" (Brickset says that the price is $9.99, but I remember it being closer to $20, for some reason?) it fits its purpose as a gameboard, and thus I recommend this set to anybody who would be interested in getting a hold of it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"MandoMando","2011-04-18T02:34:25.667Z","Great Set, Great Game","<p>This game was the first Lego game that I purchased. The box was larger than I expected, done so you can keep the pieces in the box, I presume.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The build was very straightforward and somewhat repetitive. Building the tiers of the pyramid was very repetitive but very easy at the same time. The smaller details came next, the jewels around the edge and then the scorpion. The parts assortment is very nice and I especially enjoyed the jewels that I added to my collection, along with the unique scorpion. The modified mini figures acting as play pieces were very clever and surprisingly easy to handle most of the time.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The gameplay itself was rather straightforward but slightly confusing at times. The rules scheme was very easy to follow, but be sure to have the rulebook near by. If you're playing with friends, it may be best to explain the rules as you go. My first time around there were many small rules that you forget. If you have doubts, consult the rule book.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>A favorite variation of mine is using teams, if you have enough people.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In all, this is a good set to play with friends and it should has some nice pieces, too.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
