"ekimai","2009-08-03T19:43:56.7Z","Thumbs up, with a couple of grumbles...","Firstly, let me say that this game is long overdue.  I've had it for several weeks, and it's now one of the top in the lineup when we're picking games to play at dinner parties.  This makes a refreshing alternative to Mah Jongg or Poker...

It's also enticed a number of non-AFOL adults to play with LEGO for the first time since the '70s - '80s, and the reaction has been excellent!

I opened the bags and sorted the elements as suggested, which took about 10 minutes.  I was then disappointed to notice that the trays in which to store the elements were open at the top, with a large void once the lid was replaced.  If transporting the box, you would mix everything up again!  This could so easily be solved by including zip-seal bags for each compartment, which I have added to my set myself.

The challenge cards are rated in terms of difficulty with a ""?"" rating printed on the back of the card - either ""?"", for easy, ""??"", for medium, or ""???"" for hard.  There is no text on the question cards, only images.  Whilst this may help LEGO in their goal of minimising the number of print runs, it does result in a number of images that are open to interpretation.

There is no timer of any description included.  This hasn't been a problem in my experience, but some argumentative groups may find one a necessity.

There are a number of suggested alternative rules, however there is one I would highly recommend: limit the number of guesses permitted per person.  For example, during the first game I played a friend pulled out two large wheels, and two small wheels when he began his build.  There followed a torrent of guesses which yielded a correct answer before he had connected anything!

There are a few key elements that don't appear to be included, (which I suspect would be the case if the box contained 10,000 parts), and the apparent lack of a parts listing may be irksome if some of the parts go missing.

Even though it's a game which pretty much invented itself, I'd still recommend buying it if you're into playing games.  After all, Pictionary still sells!

"voyanuitoa","2009-08-05T07:41:20.547Z","LEGO aims to be the life of the party, does it succseed","The most expensive of the new Games range, I picked up Creationary for Â£24.99 at Argos.

Although there are a good range of pieces, after a few models are built, it does seem like you no longer have the pieces you need.

The LEGO Dice has 4 plastic studs in a 2x2 layout on each face, while the edges are rubber. A spanner tool is included in the set, the flat end is designed to lever the tiles from the die.

One of the major problems is the fact that a minimum of three players is needed, this can be a problem. Also there is nothing to stop parts being mixed up during transport.

The new micro-figure included can be described by one word - tiny. It is two bricks high, compared to the four-brick height of a mini-figure.

96 cards are included, seperated in to three dificulity levels: easy (?), medium (??) and hard(???). each card has four pictures on one side, one picture for each category: nature, buildings, things and vehicles.

This is a game designed for parties, but you can also use it to test and improve your building skills. It is good, but not the best game in the Games range, that is why I give it 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AlterBrick__Vienna__Austria","2010-04-07T13:33:27.047Z","Great, constant fun for the whole family","I bought this ""set"" before Easter and had the chance to play it with 2 different circles.<br>I was the only one who played it twice.<br>Both times there was another adult, who was good at building with LEGO, too.<br>1 adult never built with LEGO before, I think - but also had much fun.<br>1 girl aged 9 was involved. The other day 1 boy aged 7.<br><br>Both kids involved enjoyed the game a lot and - won (2x only by 1 pt, but WON)!<br>They were more spontanous at guessing.<br>Basically, all ""builings"" were guessed right.<br><br>Right: As mentioned before, often one misses the best fitting parts, e.g.: build a carot without an orange brick or a penguin without a black brick . . .<br>But that is, what causes the fun in builing as well as in guessing.<br><br>And there is also a kind a dog sh.t (I hope it is <span style=""font-style: italic;"">dog </span>sh.t) on one of the cards - noone would guess this without knowing, it is in the game. So anything is possible.<br><br>The game brings many ideas what to build with the other LEGO-bricks to the kids and lowers the barrier to build something, that is not as perfect as the LEGO-sets.<br>Success is, when the others can guess what it is meant to be, even though oneself is not so happy with what it looks like . . . so it strengthens the self confidence of young builders tremendously.<br>It also brings some general trivia-knowledge to the kids, as it includes builings like the Acropolis, Eiffel Tower, Tower Bridge or Liberty Statue (btw.: that was the girl's best one!) or specific cars like a Jeep (It was guessed by the only woman in this round!).<br>This game also sharpens the eye for what is typical for something - not only for kids ;-)<br><br>BEST VALUE FOR PLAYING LEGO TOGETHER<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Elwood","2011-01-05T10:48:18.137Z","If you are that creative, you'll just buy the dice!","<p>The concept is not new, but it does definately work with Lego. The thing is, there just isn't enough parts in the set to make all the items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game puts your creative juices to the test, especially hard with a short time limit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a great game for all ages, but if this is your only Lego set you will struggle. It is frustrating too because you have to take apart your creations in order to carry on the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is alot of fun playing, you will enjoy more with extra bricks though. Although if you already have alot of Lego and are a creative type... you will probably just buy the dice and create your own creationary!</p>",TRUE,3,2,4,4,2
"Dominippy_yes_i_am_from_youtube","2011-04-02T08:13:16.573Z","Longer than you think","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>the box tells you what you need to do and instructions are simple.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>a lot but you cant build carrots (build carrots?) but you can of course use bricks from your own set.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>&nbsp;1 big 1 small i use the big one more often but you can use figures from your own set as mentioned before.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>always different but sometimes really hard (like a owl).</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>when my model is complete its already geussed because i am good.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>good fun and if you play it more often you can get better in the game and with lego!</p>",TRUE,5,3,5,5,5
"systemBuilder","2018-08-22T19:53:17.6Z","The greatest lego game of all time ...","<p>This is Lego&#39;s first LEGO-gameset. We bought it when it just came out, in 2009, it originally sold for about the average USED price listed today on this item! It is basically Pictionary and you draw a card and then try to build the item on the card (just a picture - no words) using the limited set of pieces given in the set. If you can get your partner to guess the name of the thing you are building - both of you win that round!</p>

<p>Some of the items can be challenging to build because the lego set has only 338 pieces and is a general-purpose set.&nbsp; &nbsp;If this bothers you then you can merge it with another set to give more pieces to builders, and you can also make your own cards or reserve some cards if you think they are too hard!</p>

<p>However ... This game is so much darned fun we don&#39;t have patience waiting for taking turns and my family (of 4) - we just ALL draw the cards and ALL start building AND ALL start asking people to guess what we&#39;ve built! We open up the game a play for 30 mins until we are exhausted!&nbsp; This takes some of the win/lose pressure off people and we all enjoy the fun of building the legos which is the greatest part, all the time!&nbsp; This is for anyone who loves to build LEGO, it&#39;s a new way to play and we love it more than any of our 3 other LEGO games - which were highly rated on www.lego.com -&nbsp;TOP MARKS !!!</p>

"Lego_fan_","2018-12-24T14:29:03.537Z","A creative game","<p>This is a really fun game I love playing it with my brothers. There are different icons on th die and the same on th cards when it is your turn you have to choose easy medium or hard and then roll the die. If the Icon says car it will be on your card and you will have to build some car related Item. There are 5 different Icons. While you are building this the other players are trying to figure out what it is and can guess what it is you build un till someone has guessed it right or you run out of parts. If it is guessed correctly the on who got it gets the card and the one in the end with the most cards wins. I would say it is one of the best board games I have ever played. I would highly suggest this game.</p>
