"gptee","2009-08-31T23:16:22.733Z","officially the best fire station","i like this set for the following reasons:

1. it's the third modular street building following cafe corner and green grocer. collectors of the first 2 modular buildings must get this one to complete the collection.

2. the architecture is of the 1930s style which can be found in several countries (US, Europe and countries with a colonial past). the red, white and blue flag suggests it is in the US.

3. this is the only modular building that houses a vehicle, which is a well-made authentic vintage 1930s fire truck that seats 2 firemen side by side, with plenty of space at the back for the third fellow to cling on to.

4. the interior is fully-decorated with notable playable features, including a ping-pong table, a sofa, a full kitchen (with cupboards, drawers, a sink, a stove and a large fridge stacked with drinks and sausages), a roof-top water tank, a large golden bell, a yellow fireman pole, a fire alarm, etc.

5. there are too many accessories to mention, but the most eye-catching bits are the 3 silver and 2 GOLD fireman helmets. the gold helmets serve to beautifully decorate its facade.

6. the building process can be quite tricky, especially the ""1932"" sign and and the second level front windows. nevertheless, they are interesting and beautiful creations that provide a very satisfying build.

7. this set is also unique in its huge assortment of dark-tanned and dark-red (maroon) bricks. 

8. like all the other modular buildings in the series, it is stackable! yes, if u purchase two or more fire brigades, you can stack the second levels up to create a multi-story fire brigade.

9. 4 mini-figures - 3 firemen and 1 civilian. the firemen have extra hair pieces in addition to their silver helmets. and there is 1 brown dog to chase that cat at the green grocer up the small tree.

10. this building, especially the ground level, is huge!

there are a few small problems though:

1. the small tree on the pavement is just too pathetic. but that can be corrected easily if u know how to make a bigger one.

2. the backyard looks quite empty, and is not interesting, but it doesn't really bother me.

this set is a must-buy!

"hoipaul","2009-10-01T06:07:11.06Z","A classic: Worth buying","I think this set has to be seen with your own eyes before drawing premature conclusions, so I built it and I think it really looks majestic alongside the Café Corner and Green Grocer.

Pro's:

- Best and most realistic-looking Lego fire-station up-to-date. Especially when   
  compared to the 'play-sets' (like 6385, 7240 or 7945), Lego usually produces.
- Some really advanced building techniques are used. i.e. the '1932' facade.
- Overall front-facade architecture.
- Nice extension of the modular-building line.
- The golden helmets are lovely.
- Refrigerator and table-tennis table on the 1st floor are really well done.
- Sausages! Nice!
- Subtle inclusion of a clock-tower inhabitant... I was really surprised!

Con's:

- The flag above the garage door is too blocky. I replaced it with 3 classic red-white-blue flag pieces. Looks way better now.
- I don't really like the firetruck included, though I have to say it matches the vintage style of this set. A modern truck wouldn't do.
- The back side's not really that interesting, especially when compared to the Green Grocer. Of course this is something I'll customize soon.
- A little detail I really miss in the interior: A telephone! How will these firefighters ever go into action when nobody can call them??? lol.
- Price tag's quite high, though it's definately worth the money for those of you who are into modular building.

The pro's really outweigh the con's of this building. So it's a no-brainer for me. Go and buy it while you have the chance. This is gonna be a classic.

"wouterdb","2009-11-29T07:36:06.437Z","A must-have set","
Pro:
- Architecture
- Creative use of existing bricks (the frig!, the sink!)
- color palet (grey-rusty red-brown-black)
- second floor: lots of (funny) details
- hidden details (like the bat in the tower)
- gold bricks

Con:
Not really, but if you want some:
- American flag too heavy
- Steering wheel too far away from the mini figure, but I fixed this whit an additional brick (silver, round, no. 4249039, there was one in surplus in the box...)
- One golden helmet was not very stable, I fixed it at the inner site with a yellow 1/2 bush brick

There is exceptionally high play value in this set as compared to the other modular house sets with the inclusion of an old fashioned fire engine and the fully furnished living area for the firemen on the 2nd floor.
The building experience and the beauty of this set is worth the price paid.
I'm truly impressed with the ingenuity of the designers who came up with the method for creating the numberings (1932). 
The abundant source of windows used also allows slightly more light to brighten up the interior of the building.
My only grouse with the buildings in this series is the lack of a toilet!

In my eyes there is only one con to this set: the ugly tree

Other then that it's just awesome:

- contrary to what has been suggested, there is an enormous load of new/rare pieces used in this set.
- The building process has been really really well thought out, it is the best building experience I've had building any lego set.
- Because of the re-introduction of classic lego pieces, it is a great mix of nostalgia and having new bricks and techniques around.
- If you thought the green grocer was detailed, you'll lbe amazed by the detail in this set. 

Lego deserves a 10/10 for this one!

"Nased","2011-05-10T07:33:52.983Z","Excellent Successor of Green Grocer","There are only two levels and one roof layer to play with. (Cafe Corner,
 Green Grocer and Grand Emporium have three levels and a roof layer 
each) However, the quality of the interior design and furniture made up 
for everything. I never regret buying this set at a discounted price. 
Below are the highlights of this wonderful set.<br><br>1) Vehicle:<br>So
 far this is the only modular house with a vehicle. The fire engine is 
seriously very well designed. Two mini figures can easily fit into the 
front seats. The dash board of the vehicle is a printed piece (NO 
stickers). The ladder on the vehicle is beautiful. <br><br>2) First Level:<br>-
 At the front of the building, the tiling on the first level is superb. 
The number ""3"" could very well signify that this is the 3rd set of the 
modular series. The tree looks a little flimsy but I can imagine it as a
 newly grown tree. I love the street lamp post as it is present in all 
other sets.<br>- Going to the back of the building, the tiling is not as
 beautiful and looks incomplete to me. However, that can be easily 
rectify by adding other features to the empty space.<br>- Building: The 
color combination of the walls is good. The combination of brick red and
 Grey makes the building more realistic than ever. The exterior of the 
wall is very nice. The uneven surface enhances the realism of the 
building. Personally I think the exterior of the walls (both first and 
second) is one of the better few as compared to the other modular sets.<br><br>Interior
 of the first level includes the hanger for the silver helmets; rack for
 a variety of&nbsp; tools; brown stair case to the second level, yellow pole 
for the firemen to slide down; parking lot for vehicle; front door and 
back door.<br><br>Exclusive: One of the greatest value of the Fire Brigade is the Golden Helmets on the exterior of the wall!<br><br>3) Second Level:<br>-
 The exterior of the second level is just as pretty as the first level. 
Nothing much to criticize. As mentioned earlier, I absolutely love the 
exterior walls of the Fire Brigade.<br>- The interior design and 
furniture of Fire Brigade is the soul of this set. You get several 
unique features on this floor: Sofa; Table tennis table with two 
rackets; Refrigerator; Stove; Cabinet; Brown Shelf, Basin. They are 
simply awesome! They are one of the main reasons why I love this set so 
much. The second level looks cozier than any level of other modular 
sets.<br><br>4) Roof Level: <br>- The roof level is the fastest to 
build. Special features include the Water Tank and Golden Bell. The 
finishing of the roof level is very neat.<br><br>- Climax... The most 
breathtaking feature of Lego 10197 Fire Brigade has got to be the 
numbering ""1932"". The technique used to build this feature is perfect. 
You get the sense of accomplishment and the ""Wow"" factor is really there
 when ""1932"" block is placed on the entire Fire Brigade.<br><br>5) Mini Figures:<br>- 3 Firemen: Driver, Cook and fireman with long yellow hair. <br>- Girl with shopping bag. <br><br>Conclusion:<br>Too
 good to be true. Should get it before the price shoots up. Very decent 
successor to Green Grocer. I will give it a score of 99.9/100. Minus 0.1
 to prevent complacency so that LEGO will continue to produce unrivaled 
Modular Houses in this series.&nbsp; ",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

Its WWIIish feel is one-of-a kind. The 1932 at the top is designed really cool, yet it's a bit hard to build. The fire truck is also amazing. This set has so much details crammed into it, it's hard to describe! Also it has a fridge that a mini fig can fit into... do I hear Indy? The exterior of this set is awesome using many building methods to make it look phenomenal! Each level has furniture that fits very well. The first level is a common fire station equipment, second is entertainment area where the fire fighters wait for a job, and the roof has a bell tower and water tank.

"darthdc","2010-05-31T06:49:59.06Z","Great Fires of Lego","<p>I've got to like Lego's modular buildings due down to the great detail on the exterior. Since Cafe Corner (which I have), they've also started to focus on the interior detail which Cafe Corner lacks in big time. So heres the Fire Brigade, which brings in a mix of recently designed pieces and some that have been around for ages (the sliding door)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set marks the first modular building to have a vehicle (and I hope not the last) which adds greatly to the playability. The fire truck is actually quite long and just manages to fit in the building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigures are great - the firemens' costumes look similar to those of the old sets. The young girl is a nice addition, though what her role is, is uncertain. The dog (my first) should be a dalmatian, right? Not sure the one fireman has a hairstyle of the period though (long hair)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building itself is just two floors (though each are much higher, making the building&nbsp;overall, as high as the other sets). The exterior colour scheme is perfect with the dark tan bricks of the lower level complementing the dark red/light grey of the upper level. The interior is packed with detail, with&nbsp;the fireman's pole being divided over the two floors. The idea of using frogs to hang the helmets on is unusual,&nbsp;but they work well.</p>

"brickapolis","2013-03-20T11:56:11.423Z","Finally, a DIFFERENT fire station!","LEGO is to fire stations like Nabisco is to cookies... well sort of. It 
seems like LEGO came out with a fire station right after they came out 
with interlocking plastic bricks. They certainly didn't stop there. A 
quick query of the Brickset database for ""fire station"" will return more
 than a few results. However, the only similarity between this building 
and all of the ""fire stations"" that have come before it is that they all
 have the word ""fire"" in their names. Being a part of the CC range of 
modular buildings, this set ties in perfectly with all of those that 
came before it while still adding a North American flare to the lineup. 
Most every other fire station that has  come before it looks more 
European than American, this set helps to change that. This fire station
 would look just as much at home on the streets of New York as it would 
on the streets of LEGOLAND. So if you're hesitating to purchase this 
set, I'd advise you to bite the bullet. If you're an American LEGO fan

 this set. It's definitely worth every penny.",FALSE,5,4,3,5,4
"Nesquik","2013-01-12T11:27:34.453Z","A Class Apart ","Now that the Creator 'modular buildings' are about to enter their seventh phase, it's as good a time as any to reflect on how the product line has matured into a regular and widely anticipated schedule. It was around the time of the <i>Fire Brigade's </i>release that TLG confirmed they had sold enough of the previous buildings to continue making more products.<div><br></div><div>Even today, three years after its release, it still remains possibly the best value modular building of the entire series.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures</b></div><div>I have no idea why the designers chose the 'classic face' for the minifigure heads (and not other Creator products), but I really think it works a treat for these buildings as it adds a lot of innocence to the setting; that being the buildings reflect on the passage of time and culture, rather than up-to-date designs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Our civilian in this product is, truth be told, a little on the plain side torso wise, but I think the handbag makes up for this as it's a rare piece. In addition, we have our three firefighters who seem to be enjoying their time at the fire station. Although you have the option to switch the hats and hairpieces around, we have two males and a female - the former donning a brown hairpiece and a chef's hat, the latter having a blond hairpiece. When they're called into action, the silver fire-hats are located on the ground level, as well as many different tools and an O2 tank. The torsos are standard, but also instantly recognisable.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, a small brown Alsatian is there to sniff out danger and, if you haven't already guessed, sniff out the sausages in the fridge! Any animals or pets are always welcome in the Lego world, so I'm delighted to have this pooch in my collection now. Minifigure wise, this is a decent pack and although there's little exclusivity to the parts, they can at least be replaced easily.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Build and Play</b></div><div>Aged 16+, I think TLG have hit the nail on head with their assessment of these buildings. They all obviously share a lot of traits (particularly the walls/facades), but if you have children who are perhaps feeling a little more confident than they should, then don't be fooled into purchasing this for them. Products like this require a lot of time, patience and concentration to build - these are for many customers the highlights of a big Lego model, and when combined with the number of small components, they won't add up to a happy experience for under sixteen-year olds.</div><div><br></div><div>With anything as big as product, I enjoy building them on and off whenever I'm home from work, and this extends the life of the build. In short, it was a pleasing experience that definitely got better and better towards the First Floor as you begin making the fun micro-builds. I found the ground floor a little laborious as, with all that open space inside, you're essentially just circling the walls to make it higher and higher. With the First Floor, you're required to jump back and forth between all the great interior decorations/details and the structure of the floor itself, so your time is broken up nicely. Learning how to make a bookshelf, ping pong table, stove, fridge and even a art deco styled couch was fantastic, and surely a memorable experience in all my years of Lego building. These techniques are obviously repeated in other modulars, but they're done so with different slants.</div><div><br></div><div>The roof section can bring a little frustration into the mix when you construct the '1932' detail, as you may want to make it as flat and level as possible. This is a problem with this particular SNOT technique as the 1x1 plates are held together with small pins, so if you're not careful, the whole thing can end up looking rather wonky! In contrast, the bell tower (and its gold bricks) was a nice touch and greatly adds to the overall effect of the building. In my opinion, it works far better on this model than on the <i>Town Hall</i>, in which it is basically there to make the building appear even taller.</div><div><br></div><div>But before you even make the building, you're directed to the small fire truck that can be stored inside or left out to admire. I have mixed feelings about this vehicle as it highlights one of the problems with the Creator ethos, and that is that although it looks very sweet and of its period, it's easily broken. To make matters worse - and I hope this was an isolated incident, although in my case it's happened regularly - the long grey plate used for the base was warped slightly, which means that the whole truck now looks bent.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The overall finish and styling of this product is too good to be true. I've had the pleasure of owning Lego for almost two decades now, but this is the one product that will get a visitor's attention, and is a certain talking point. It demonstrates how much detail can be packed into a relatively small space with so many bricks, and perhaps more so than any other modular building so far, the design instantly&nbsp;<i>looks </i>recognisable. The water tower, red bricks, grey bricks, rolling shutter and more all add up to the 1930's New York look and feel that we associate with, and that's a mighty feat. But even better, it will never look out of place in a Lego city because it can exist both as a piece of a history or an active fire brigade.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Highlights</b></div><div>It's difficult to pick out my favourite areas of this product, but I think the way in which all the space was utilised within the building is the best reason to purchase it. Whereas other modular buildings have used their bareness as a way to either encourage you to place your own decorations in or because the Lego resident hasn't 'moved in', this fire brigade uses every stud and corner to its advantage. The Ground Floor is vast for a reason; large objects need to be carried around (including ladders), and the vehicle itself isn't exactly short. We also see various tools and boxes/bins placed around this area, and some open space for the people to walk around.</div><div><br></div><div>The First Floor is then basically dedicated to the living quarters, and the advantage here is that the designers packed in as much as they could. It's a beautiful looking area and crams in so much detail that I fear the owner of the <i>Pet Shop </i>will be sneaking in to play ping pong!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Compromises</b></div><div>There's really not a great deal to criticise when viewing this product. I could point out the more uniform colour scheme of the bricks and their lack of variety compared to other buildings, but this actually works to the product's advantage.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The only other thing I could think of is that although an 'Alarm' box is attached to the wall outside the station (which members of the public can press to raise the alarm), there really should be a telephone inside... Strange how that was left out.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Final Thoughts</b></div><div>In terms of bang for buck, this a modular building that ranks there up at the top - 4.5 pence per piece is insane value money these days. At 2231 pieces, this has 200 pieces more than the <i>Pet Shop </i>and about 150 more than the <i>Grand Emporium</i>, yet both of these products are £20 and £33 more expensive. What you're also getting is a product that has far more 'wow' factor due to it's iconic look, whereas the latter buildings, although impressive in their own ways, don't grab me in the same way. The only way to reverse this argument is that both the <i>GE</i>&nbsp;and <i>PS </i>have better playability value and small accessories/components.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Regardless, this is a beautiful building that encapsulates everything I love about Lego. While its quality of architecture out-weighs the playability factor, you have to consider that at 16+, most builders will be mature enough to keep this a presentation piece and fiddle around with it on their desk (while shouting in their own head ""Get back to work!""). It will add an air of class to any Lego display, but at the same time, is filled with the usual great surprises inside.</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,5

compliments the whole building (with once again, good use of SNOT) and 
uses nice brick colors to emphasize the classical old look. On the 
roof, a variation of pieces are used to ingeniously create a 1932 sign, 
and more innovative techniques are used to make a crowning. Each of 
these beautiful elements are used in such a way, that they all come 
under the same classic genre, producing a final, most beautiful 
masterpiece, that is the 1932 Fire Brigade.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>Interior Decoration &amp; Design</span><br>Yet
 again, LEGO has produced something that will not be forgotten. The 
highly detailed interior of the Fire brigade produces no less of an 
applaud then the exterior, for it's nicely made functions, and 
everything a fire brigade would need. The interior features include a 
driveway for the fire truck to park (and doors on both sides of the fire
 brigade), a sliding pole that connects the top and bottom floors 
(whilst also having stairs), a rack to hang hats and plenty more small 
details. On the second floor, there are many cute elements that has not 
been seen in LEGO before, such as the ping pong table (with 2 rackets, a
 ball and a net), and a fridge that can house a sausage. Next, a unique 
kitchen set includes an oven, range hood, counter and 4 filaments on 
which you can place a sauce pan or pot. Other features include a sofa 
and opening windows. Now, there are stairs which lead to the roof. 
Creatively made, this model uses a door which is used horizontally, not 
vertically as you might have expected. The water tower uses 2 
half-barrels to create a whole barrel. Another creative feature (which I
 must say, blends in as if it was using another piece) is that to hold 
up the barrel, this model uses a roll cage that you would find on 
power-miner sets. The last thing on the roof is the splendid gold bell, 
which rocks back and forth as if a real bell (But unfortunately, does 
not ring). To house the bell, a new LEGO element is used to create a 
gazebo-like structure.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>The Fire truck</span><br>Now,
 what's a fire brigade without a fire truck? In terms of saying this 
truck is a separate model from the actual fire brigade, this truck is a 
must for any LEGO car enthusiast. This classical design uses many 
special elements in conjunction to create a true, 1932 fire truck. One 
feature that LEGO does not normally implement in their sets, is the 
bricks that make the bull bar. As some of you out there might not know, 
the binocular LEGO element has a nifty feature - you can place poles in 
the holes located at the top of the binoculars. When receiving this set,
 I was really quite surprised. Although I had already known this 
feature, I did not expect LEGO to use it. However, it does look 
brilliant with the fire truck.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">Build Experience<br>Having
 2231 pieces, this model will sure to give you plenty of building time. 
Unlike the Grand Carousel, the build is not too repetitive, meaning more
 variety in what you are building, and also meaning it would be a bit 
less tedious (not saying that the Grand Carousel is too tedious).</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">Overall Pros and Cons</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>Pros</span><br>How LEGO used SWOT techniques<br>The design<br>The fact that the fire truck can be parked inside the fire brigade<br>The exterior decorations<br>The features inside<br>The Fire truck</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>Cons</span><br>Not many, but while play the bull bar of the fire truck tends to fall off.

<p>This set has 4 minifigures. There are three male firefighters and 1 female civilian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Floor: The first floor has a lot of detail! There is a smooth sidewalk with a tree and a lamp. The frontside of the first floor has a door for the garage to hold the firetruck this set comes with. There is also a front door next to the garage. I really like the two lamps and the way the front wall is designed. There's also an American Flag!&nbsp;There isn't much on the sides of the building exept for the pieces that enable you to connect modular buildings together.The back has a back door and back door for the firetruck.&nbsp;On the inside of the first floor there is a pole for the fire fighters to slide down, stairs to the second floor,a garbadge can, a tool rack, a box of tools,&nbsp;and a place that holds fire extinguishers, fire helmets etc.&nbsp;</p>

Theres nothing on the sides. There really isn't much on the back except for a few windows. The inside has a ton of detail though. There is a fridge with drinks and 2 of the same rare piece that looks like a hot dog. There is a sofa for the firefighters to relax on, a stairway to the roof, a pole to the first floor,&nbsp;a ping-pong&nbsp;table and a giant cabinet. There's even a little kitchen! </p>

"MaartenRF10","2013-08-05T18:03:45.467Z","Great start to modular building","After my son reached the Lego building age of 4, I soon started searching the internet for nice sets for him to build. While doing so I came across the Lego Modular Buildings. From the moment I saw them, I wanted to have them. And after four weeks of doubting whether I wasn't too old for playing and whether it would be worth the money, I decided to go for it.<br><br>The Fire Brigade seemed like the perfect building to start with. Lowest cost per part and a spectacular looking building. The package arrived after two days and as soon as the kids were gone to bed, I started building. The groun floor took one night (about 3 1/2 hours) to build. I didn't bother sorting the parts, I just made sure the contents of each sack weren't mixed. Building it was a lot of fun, especially it being the first large structure I was making. The first floor and the roof however were even more fun to make. I did this the second night. Again it took me about 3 hours. It was a more challenging and more fun build though. The interior of the first floor is very much fun to make. I love details like the table tennis table and the sofa. Challenging was, like mentioned by most people, to make the 1932. Fortunately, having read previous reviews, I was prepared for this and it came out very neat.<br><br>I'm now going to have to decide which building to go for next! (And where to put it on display, for we don't have that much space...)<br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Exterior, it looks absolutely beautiful.<br></li><li>Interior, full of lovely detailed furniture and other things.<br></li><li>Car, the car is a nice extra, giving it some more playability.<br></li></ul>

"Bricky_Dee_Williams","2014-05-16T22:01:53.95Z","Top dog in the Firehouse. ","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>For starters, as with most Lego Exclusives, the box is absolutely GIGANTIC. It kept popping out of the bag when we brought it home. And that was the biggest plastic bag at Downtown Disney. But not too disappoint, the box was practically filled to the brim. (And when you cut it open, it makes great storage for pieces when you haven&#39;t yet finished the set) The instructions, which this set comes with two booklets, are quite lengthy. (Though what would you expect, it&#39;s a modular) Fairly easy to follow, though uses MANY pieces in each step. Lego could have divided the pieces up better. But hey, it&#39;s not 16+ for nothing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Huge assortment. Over Two Thousand of them included. They go in range from a 12x6&nbsp;flat grey plate to a golden fire helmet. (And toads, which serve as hat holders. Gotta love multi-purpose toad pieces) Anyway, the parts also include a ton of plate pieces that make of mostly floor and roofing, and a two 32x16 grey baseplates. (Could&#39;ve gone with one big 32x32, but they didn&#39;t. I still love you Lego) Also, the set comes with a variety of light grey and dark red pieces to make of the walls, which are a nice addition. The two long fiber-optic pieces that make up the fire pole are cool pieces too. And who doesn&#39;t love the huge castle doors in back? Great pices.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;in the set are really nothing special, as with most modular characters.(save the&nbsp;characters in Market Street) They are normal townies, with the classic yellow head and Lego smile, and normal firefighter uniforms. The mail lady (or is that supposed to be a purse) has the original brown ponytail piece, and a light blue shirt. The dog has no spots or extra decal, but is just that: a brown dog. Still pretty good minifigures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build: diff-i-cult. And on top of that, it takes hours. But it&#39;s all wothr&nbsp;it. Getting to build the refrigerator, the Ping-Pong table, the mini kitchen, the bookshelf; all such great and fun builds. the truck is a great build. Another fun part was most definitely the bell tower. The golden plate on the bottom is an interesting design on the bell. The whole set is so fun just to look at time to time and see it comin along, thinking &quot;wow&quot;.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Humongous. But again, it&#39;s a modular. It measures just above fifteen inches high, and is astonishingly tall compared to a minifigure. It&#39;s very to-scale of a real firehouse, not like the new City ones with no back. Or sides. And with small, empty garages. And horrible, big windows. Not really a fan of those. Anyway, the interior is so detailed. With a small but full kitchen, and a hobby area with a shelf and Ping-Pong table, and the caution brick on the floor in front of the fire pole, this model is close to complete. All it&#39;s missing is a hose. And a long hose at that. The water tower is on the roof. At least the truck has a ladder. They&#39;re gonna need it. And a ladder extension.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Overall opinion</span></p>

<p>An absolutely fantastic set that is absolutely perfect in each and every way. I believe it to be the best modular building Lego has made, and the best building they&#39;ve made. Period. It&#39;s a highly detailed model, and has so much to offer for your collection. My verdict: Absolutely get it.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Great model.</p>

<p>-Includes one of the best Lego vehicles I&#39;ve seen</p>

<p>-Detailed interior</p>

<p>-Fun build</p>

<p>-Vast assortment of great pieces</p>

<p>-Classic building, great to display</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Long build, takes hours.</p>

<p>-Pricey, as it is now retired.</p>

<p>-No hose.</p>

"Wendigo1","2019-11-03T15:13:25.7Z","A great experience ruined by poor quality","<p>This is my first review of a set (hopefully of many more to come). I welcome any feedback.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:&nbsp;I have built numerous creator expert sets before, though they were newer ones like the Detective Office, Brick Bank, Theater, etc. I have yet to build the Grand Emporium, Town Hall, and Assembly Square.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Fire Brigade&#39;s build is fairly interesting, especially for the ground level. Two dark stone grey&nbsp;16x32&nbsp;baseplates&nbsp;comprise the base, which is a little unusual since 32x32&nbsp;baseplates&nbsp;have been a staple of LEGO for decades. The slight gap this set up creates&nbsp;is only visible from the rear due to the various tiles that comprise sidewalk hiding the gap in the front. One of the unusual pieces (of which there are several in this set) is a dark stone grey&nbsp;8x16&nbsp;tile that makes up the driveway inside the building. However, this unusual piece isn&#39;t made with the usual ABS plastic. It feels cheap and lesser quality for LEGO. This quality problem hit me hard during the second story construction. I had&nbsp;more than 12 of each&nbsp;1x1 and 1x2&nbsp;dark red tiles break when emplacing the masonry facade. Moreover all of the dark red bricks made the cheapest, cringey&nbsp;snapping sounds when I was assembling them. I have had LEGO for more than 30 years and never had a set just feel like it was secretly Lepin&nbsp;or some knockoff. I called customer service, which was as usual outstanding.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>With those complaints aside (and they were substantial), I loved all of the small details the expert sets are known for. The&nbsp;molding on the second floor windows used the unique grill piece that the fire engine uses. Flipping the grill upside down was so clever.&nbsp;The windows just pop with that neat touch. The golden fire helmets and black axes one the first floor are great as well. The refrigerator and ping pong table helped to break up the wall building on the second floor and again employed pieces in clever ways.&nbsp;The bell tower on the roof has another clever LEGO touch: a hidden bat roosting in the belfry. Awesome. This is what I expect from LEGO for this kind of set.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reality of this being being an older set means the minifigures are nothing special. The three firefighters and one visitor have&nbsp;standard yellow smile and no leg or arm printing. Even the dog is a single color mold. LEGO color usage on these aspects&nbsp;has gotten better since this set came out. The tree is definitely an older way to create this feature. It&#39;s been far improved since as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This set is a welcome addition to my city, though it is not without its flaws. I would recommend if you can find this at a reasonable price since it&#39;s been long retired now.&nbsp;</p>
",TRUE,4,2,4,5,4
"Kamiccolo","2020-01-06T17:34:47.84Z","A fantastic addition to the modular line, but...","<p>It&#39;s been a long time since this set has been off the shelves but I figured a new review of it would help anyone considering buying it second hand or&nbsp;MISB. I&nbsp;decided to write this review due to the condition of some parts which I&#39;ll explain in the parts section.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Build:<br />
<br />
As far as the build experience goes it&nbsp;shows it&#39;s age as some portions of the build are kinda lackluster and monotonous, the monotony is&nbsp;expected from most architectural sets though building this after the recent modular buildings like the Downtown Diner and Assembly Square made me realize how much they&#39;ve improved the build experience&nbsp;both in terms of the techniques and&nbsp;the small details you build.&nbsp;With all that said it still has a handful of clever and interesting building techniques to keep it entertaining enough and make it stand out in it&#39;s own right among the other modular buildings.<br />
<br />
The building process is divided into two manuals with the first one covering the fire engine and the first floor&nbsp;and the second one covering the second floor and roof so without ample building space available it can get a bit difficult to pour around&nbsp;1000 pieces for each section of the build.<br />
<br />
The parts:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;As far as parts variety goes&nbsp;it&#39;s fairly decent, it doesn&#39;t have an awful lot of exclusive or hard to find pieces so I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be too difficult to bricklink&nbsp;if you choose to do so.<br />
<br />
It comes with two 16x32 dark grey baseplates as opposed to a 32x32 one which we expect from more recent modular buildings. it didn&#39;t make any sense to me to use those so I swapped them for a 32x32&nbsp;light&nbsp;grey baseplate, In the process I also swapped the 8x16&nbsp;dark grey tile that holds the plates together with 16 2x4&nbsp;dark&nbsp;grey tiles.<br />
<br />
The walls of the second floor are primarily made of dark red bricks and tiles decorating the facade and this is where things got ugly and quite concerning.&nbsp;As it turns out dark red and reddish brown parts made during a certain period which this set is from became extremely brittle after some time and this modular unfortunately happens to be from that time period.<br />
<br />
As I was building the walls the bricks felt really stiff and&nbsp;I noticed cracks forming on some of the corner bricks, most I managed to hide but I had to replace a few as they looked quite bad.<br />
a few 1x1 and 1x2 bricks also made a bit of a cracking noise though I couldn&#39;t spot any visible cracks so I moved on. while I was building the facade I had 9 1x2&nbsp;dark red tiles snap in half instantly, another one snapped a few second after and one even snapped off overnight, most of the reddish brown parts used for the furniture cracked and the connectors of the 2x2x2&nbsp;box pieces used to make what I assume is a bookshelf also snapped though luckily they&#39;re completely covered so it&#39;s not visible, a few 1x2 and 1x1 plates both in dark red and reddish brown also cracked and I decided to swap those as well.<br />
<br />
Luckily there were no issues with any pieces from the fire engine, first floor and roof&nbsp; but the black pieces felt a bit&nbsp;stiffer than usual although aren&#39;t brittle.<br />
<br />
The Minifigures:<br />
<br />
There&#39;s really not much to say about the minifigures, you get three firemen and one visitor.&nbsp;two&nbsp;of the fireman have hairpieces and one has a chef&#39;s hat, you can have them wear their silver fireman helmets if you choose to display them that way,&nbsp;the visitor is really bland but&nbsp;being a somewhat old set it&#39;s acceptable.<br />
<br />
Verdict:<br />
<br />
If you can find it for a good deal or simply want to complete your modular buildings collection this is definitely a worth addition to the line, it has a beautiful facade with a lot of lovely little details (my favorite being the bat hanging behind the bell tower) though be prepared to potentially swap out all of the dark red and reddish brown pieces or at least the ones that crack or break during the build process, I&#39;m not sure if all of the 10197 sets will have this issue but considering the fact that it&#39;s fairly old even if it&#39;s one of the last batches produced it&#39;ll likely have some issues regarding the reddish brown and dark red pieces, luckily none are uncommon parts so you won&#39;t have to worry about them being expensive to get a hold of.<br />
