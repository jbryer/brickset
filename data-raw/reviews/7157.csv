Much better then paying 12.99 for a gold stomtrooper but there is no way to get its head off because it a key chain. I love gold so i'm biased. I dont thik it can be bought cause the hands/arms/legs would be really useful!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MayTheBricksBeWithYou","2009-07-03T11:43:07.64Z","A nice bonus to any order","I received this one today with my order from the 29th of June (instead of the 1th of July) and it's a nice treat if you just spent 70+ euros on an order.

I must say that I expected it to be encased in some sort of packaging. But it's just the keychain with a small paper booklet attached to the ring. It was 'tossed' into the big box that contained my order, so I'm glad it survived the journey. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"YellowedWhitePieces","2009-07-04T14:55:01.28Z","Not quite perfect","A very nice promo item, but it's unfortunately marred in execution because the hands aren't plated gold like the rest of the figure.  Perhaps it was ufeasible to color the hands, but it makes the figure look a little strange.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Z_wing","2009-07-05T06:15:37.28Z","Why tan hands?","the fact that it doesn't have gold hands is the only con in my opinion. however it is probably the best keychain lego has ever made

It is a fairly good key-chain except the fact that the hands on it aren't Gold but instead are tan. If you didn't get it for the promotional don't pay more than $3-$3.50. <br>",TRUE,3,3,1,1,5
