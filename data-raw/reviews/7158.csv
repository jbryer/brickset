"LindsayJoy","2009-06-25T13:47:16.31Z","Amazingly beautiful! I want to thank LEGO for this!","I love the new magnets in general. Because unlike the old magnets where pieces were glued the new magnets are full fledged minifigures! They take no effort to come off their base. And none of the parts are glued together!

I love the LEGO star war figures and this just is a total embodiment of the 10 years Star Wars LEGO anniversary. 

I paid 12.99 and got mine from LEGOLAND but now they are on the US site with no purchasing limit ( I could only get 2 from, LEGO LAND), but I ordered a couple extras from the US site because the silver arms and legs could really be useful for making a custom minifig. If I only had 2 I wouldn't dare touch them but now I can use some for parts!

"legojango","2009-07-10T02:28:44.513Z","this is great","I really wanted that chrome c-3po, but didn't get get one. Then, when the chrome darth vader came out, I bought like ten starwars sets to assure I'd get one. But, I didn't get it. I love this set because is was out there, I knew I'd get it, and I had the money. I thought $10 was a little pricy, considering 90% of the price was for the magnet part. Here are my pros and cons.

PROS:
chrome!
new magnet
everything else

CONS:
the price
It seems painted, there are white blots inside the helmet, the top of the legs, and the inside torso.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"michaelvader","2009-07-25T08:25:57.387Z","The coolness! ","This is a very cool magnet! You can take the mini fig off which is why I bot this. This is one of the best sets in history of LEGO! 


pros:

everything! 

cons:

They could of put sliver hands on it but oh well!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Obi_wan_Legobi","2009-09-27T16:06:18.34Z","Lego should be ashamed to have this represent its prosperity with Star Wars over the last ten years.","If you like Lego magnets then get this set and stick it on your fridge or, if you want it in your room, stick it on something in your room. However, if you have a taste for chrome legos or just like good legos, then skip this set. If it was just another magnet set than it would have gotten a better rating, but it's not. It's the 10th anniversary set, and it should be better. When you take him off his magnet he's just like an average minifig besides the chrome of course. The inside of his helmet and his body is white when it should be chrome. The prongs that keep his head and legs attached are white. The upper corners of his sides are white behind his arm sockets. The top of his legs that are visible when he sits are white, and the sides of his legs that are facing each other are white. Overall, this set looks like someone spray painted it chrome and forgot some spots rather than it being made of a chromey plastic. The reason why I don't like this set is because it should show the prosperity and good design of the Star Wars sets, but I think that it shows the opposite. If you want the 10th anniversary Star Wars Lego set then get this, if not then save your money.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"GameMasterForever","2009-07-24T22:45:09.577Z","Protect your refrigerator with the ultimate magnet!!","This set is pretty fair price compared on how to get the other two special color characters. This is only $9.99. The chrome minifigure can be taken apart. It comes with the rifle. This set is really nice to have on your refrigerator. This magnet protect your refrigerator forever.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

set (852737) is a LEGO Magnets set which came out in 2009. It comes

<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Stormtrooper:</span>
The stormtrooper looks awsome in his shiny armor. The only problem is: The inside of the helmet and the inside of this legs are printed white. If you got this guy I wouldn't put him in a LEGO bin because you can destroy the chrome structure. This figure has some markings on his back and he has a black head under his helmet. This set also comes with a long blaster rifle.<br><br><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Positive:</span><br><br></p>

"Lomby","2010-04-03T23:13:32.187Z","Quality Collector's Item","<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>For the completionist or collector, this little guy is a must have. A striking fig for any collection at a reasonable price considering it's limited run.<br />
<br />
For display, not play. Fingerprints are easily visible, so if removed from the blister pack make sure you handle it carefully and minimally.<br />
<br />
Comes with blaster rifle and detachable magnet. Some force was required to get the fig off the stand, no other structural issues.<br />
<br />

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>- Great for collectors</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>- Magnet is fully detachable</li>

"kmv224","2010-07-21T17:21:00.333Z","That's it?!","<p>This set is a rip-off. No doubt.</p>
<p>I keep the minifig in my favorites collection (the old Knight's Kingdom chess set box minus the chess). I use the magnet piece for one of my favorite minifigs.I sometimes regret getting this set.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>

    <li>Cool minifig</li>

<p>Cons:</p>

    <li>$10.00 for a stupid magnet</li>

    <li>The silver is painted on by some cheap metallic paint</li>
