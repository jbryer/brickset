"rabk295","2009-07-14T12:14:09.187Z","Great ""set."" (Is it a set???)","Wow. This is probably the best of the 4 battle packs. The only one possibly better is the Dwarf Battle pack, 'cause they're so hard to come by, those dwarves! It comes with 5 cool minifigures, and it is definitely worth buying. On to pros and cons:

Pros:

3 troll shields, which are very hard to get.
1 of the shoulder protectors (very cool!).
2 of each color troll helmets, + 1 other type.
2 silver troll swords, 1 double-bladed axe, 1 large axe, and 1 tall pike thingy.
2 ripped up brown capes, not in many other sets (just the Troll Fortress I think).
Both types of troll torsos.

Cons:

The price. It costs $15 in the U.S., meaning $3 for each fig.
It should come with 1 silver sword and 1 bronze sword, not 2 silvers, IMO.
It could have come with the new troll king head, not just the old ones.

Other than that, this is a great set that is a castle fan must get.

A rat also comes with the set, which is good. The 'Elite Trolls', according to the description, incude capes and gold helmets.

Pros:
Lots of different trolls, and two elites

Cons:
Expensive

Overall, a decent set, 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"OrangeBlooded31","2010-03-08T19:45:28.297Z","Army Builder","<p>I picked this set up of of Ebay for $30. My&nbsp; ""value for money"" is based off of this, because if you're just looking to buy the set now, it's going to cost you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only complaint with the actual product is that everything comes pre-assembled. It would have been nice to put the Trolls together and actually have something to build. This would have added alot to the item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still a nice piece. It is a nice army builder for those that play, and this set gives alot of figures for those who like to create displays.</p>",TRUE,4,5,1,5,1

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really very pleased by their looks, the design of the weapons, armor and sheilds. It's just a beautiful little set if you can find them still for retail and not at inflated e-bay prices.</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,5,3
