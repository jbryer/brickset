"Rgijaba","2009-09-19T22:42:44.14Z","Dwarf Warrior Battle Pack ","This is a pretty good set. It includes five dwarves, which is a good number considering how few there seem to be in most sets. As with the other Castle battle packs, they're a hard to remove from the plastic. The minifigures include a bunch of accesories such as a pickaxe, a few axes, a few shields, a torch, and some ore. The biggest problem for me is how two with the winged helmets' beards are on backwards for some reason. If you got this and the Troll Warrior Battle Pack you could have a little battle, I suppose.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2010-01-25T14:36:13.547Z","Dwarf army","This was one of the many sets me and my brother got for christmas 2009. There's not much to say about this set, only that it incudes 9 more pieces than the Troll Warrior Battle Pack, and includes lots of accessories like a barrel with a spade and hammer, lots of weapons like a torch, sheilds, axes and a pickaxe, and a silver crystal and a gold crystal. Lots of the actual dwarves' heads are actually City or Aqua Raiders heads, which is strange.

Pros:
Loadsa Dwarves
Loadsa accessories, including crystals
Huge variety of helmets

Cons:
Expensive
Weird heads

Overall, a good set, 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

My only serious problem is the fact that it cost me $15.00 at the time. It should have cost more in the range of $10-$12. Requires no building which is both a good thing for little kids and a bad thing for older kids that like to build. Overall a decent set.<br><br><br><br>",TRUE,3,5,1,3,2

Dwarves are so elusive and so desirable that it’s almost as if LEGO knew that this battle pack would quickly sell out and become exorbitant on the second-hand market. It doesn’t even matter that $15 a pop was outrageous to begin with; it doesn’t matter that many of the Dwarves in this particular Battle Pack have the strange double-sided head that doesn’t belong to Fantasy Era at all. It’s the only way to get five Dwarves at one shot along with a whole bunch of tools and crystals to make things even more fun.</div><div><br></div><div>If you are at all a passing fan of fantasy LEGO, do yourself a favour and find some way to include Dwarves’ Mine into your collection along with at least one battle pack of Dwarves.
