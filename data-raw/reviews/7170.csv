The Shadow Storm-Trooper did come in a battle pack and tie variant so he is kind of rare.  And last the Snow-Trooper he was kind of a pain to get too as most of the sets he came in are in the $100 range but now he can be find in new battle packs.  Some good things about this magnet set are, they come with weapons and since it is newer the figures are on magnet bases (unlike the older ones where the magnets would of been in side the figures themselves).  

Since I did not have a Battle Damage Vader this was good.  And having extra Snow-Trooper and Shadow Storm-Trooper are good bonuses.  (Plus LEGO was having a Black Friday sale going on at the time.  And, I got the Medieval Market Village with this set,  so I consider I got this set for free.)  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

While it is a good set, some people simply do not have the money to shell out in order to buy it so this is a nice alternative. His 'helmet' is actually an old face guard that is attachable to helmets. The face guard comes from the 'Aquaraiders' line of LEGO. I was actually disappointed to discover this because I thought I was getting something rare.<br><br>The snowtrooper has lost value recently because of his appearance not once but twice in a battle pack, as well as another relatively cheap Star Wars set. He's still pretty nifty to have and you can never have too many footsoldiers in the ongoing fight between the Rebellion and the Empire.<br><br>The Shadowtrooper, on the other hand, is a pretty rare figure that does not appear in many sets at all, thus making him valuable. Underneath both of the trooper helmets is a black, unprinted LEGO head. This makes the Shadowtrooper one of the blackest minifigures produced in quite a while. If you want to know the backstory behind the Shadowtroopers I suggest going to the Wookiepedia and reading up on them. Very interesting backstory there. <br><br><br>In the end though what you really have here is 3 minifigures and three magnets. That is it. Nothing more. The magnets stick well to the fridge and other surfaces. Two of these minifigures are rare and one is very very common now. <br><br>I would recommend this set if you wanted the two rarer minifigures.<br>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,3
