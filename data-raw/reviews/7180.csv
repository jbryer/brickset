"james3426","2009-10-31T15:47:29.39Z","Most playable mini","This set, unlike the Ventor mini, is very playable. The legs and cannons can move, but the middle legs move sideways, so I keep them in the down position. The translucent clear pieces are one of my favorite pieces here, like all clear pieces. This is also very clone wars movie accurate, since there are four cannons in the front, and a big cannon on the top.. I would have gotten two, but that would mean you would have to get two brickmaster subscriptions, which is $80 USD! 

pros:
Playable mini
Very detailed
Move-able font and back legs
Move-able cannons.
Good for display

cons:
Middle leg cannot move forward

Even though there are cons here and no cons on my mini-Ventor review, this in my opinion is a better set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set takes 5-10 on average to build and when completed is small but quite impressive. The set's pieces are designed very well and it looks just like the 2008 set. The turret looks a little bit too big but it doesn't matter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is more for display than playability really as the model is hard to move which due to the middle legs not moving. but this set is a very good mini and if you really want this you may still find it somewhere.&nbsp; </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,2,5
"blaksamu12","2011-04-14T22:56:01.687Z","Cool Mini Set","<p>The mini Brickmaster exclusive AT-TE Walker&nbsp;is really cool.&nbsp; Unfortunately, i dont have the large AT-TE, but this looks really cool.&nbsp; The set has a short, quick build, only lasting about 3-5 minutes, but is really interesting.&nbsp; The pieces are cool because they actually look like an AT-TE, even though so little pieces are used.&nbsp; The antenna pieces are nice for MOCing, too.&nbsp; It has some loose pieces, but is very playable.&nbsp; Laslty, since it came with the $40 Brickmaster Subscription for FREE, is has a very good value for money.</p>
