TITLE SCREEN.
Not much, just a nice blue background and the same picture as on the case on the upper sreen, really good music though. This is also the place where you can select wich save file you want to play(2 save files total).

MAIN SCREEN
This is where you can decide where to go.

Options: from here you can adjust the music and SFX volume, as well as change the language and watch the credits. You can save as well.

Conquests: this is where there are some different achievements that you earn as you play the game.

Multiplayer: you can play LB with your friends here, its unfortunately multi-card.

Lego Store: Here you can buy characters to use in your multiplayer and Free Play armies, View Help and hints, enter Cheat Codes, buy Concept art, Buy maps for Free Play, View cutscenes that you have unlocked, and view your percentage of completion, the amount of minikits you've found, the amount of Lego Studs you've collected, the red bricks you've unlocked, and the amount of time you've been playing.

Single Player: Once you touch the single Player area, you'll go to a screen where you can choose to either do Free play, or story.

GAMEPLAY: the gameplay is great, despite being incredibly basic. but some of the levels are ridiculously hard, for example, in one of the alien levels you have to play as some space criminals and commandeer an earth claw tank, it goes smoothly until you get to the claw tank, because even if you manage to succsesfully commandeer it, your troops still keep shooting at it, and eventually destroy it, and you lose.

But all in all, its a good game, and I recommend it.

Despite it being hard, I actually welcome that, since most of the games that I've played have been incredibly easy.

"marko5000","2010-01-10T05:01:45.59Z","One of my favorite ds games!","Finally! A lego strategy game! It's worth the price.Here's a pros and cons list:

Pros:
- 6 playable story's (castle: good/evil, pirates: pirates-imperials, mars m.:man/alien)
- heroes such as: -ghost
                          -santa
                          -forestman
                          -sheriff     
                          -and it just goes on..
-many different units from lego sets and ones not in lego sets
-funny cutscenes
-red bricks (cheats, I'm not sure thats a pro or a con..)
-lots of tracks
-mutiplayer (not wi-fi)
-many cool achievments and minifigures
-cool unlockables such as:sorceress, queen, dwarf king...

Cons:
-if u want to play multiplayer u need another card and another ds to play,
(u need as many cards as many players there are max. 8)
-the A.I is kinda stupid
-the storylines play in 3 themes (pirates, castle, mars mission)
could have at least had 3 more themes like western, star wars, a subtheme like fright knights..

Altogether I give it a 4.7/5.0
