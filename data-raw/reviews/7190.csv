"Makutaxxx","2009-07-27T21:26:42.653Z","Awesomest Set","This set is awesome. Its is bigger than Takanuva and has an interesting build. It includes 2 life counters and a Golden Ignika!! The sword and shield are an awesome weapon and is a lot better than the canister version of him. This set should belong to any bionicle collector.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-11-01T14:08:51.42Z","My tallest Bionicle!","Even though this does not look like the smaller version of Mata Nui much when it is supposed to and the fact that I prefer the scale in which every Bionicle is in, this is awesome! He is a head taller than Takanuva and over twice the size of the small Mata Nui. I am not sure if he is taller than Kardas, but as I said, he is super sized! His head looks a little too high, but I do not care much. This picture lies a little about the size of the scarab shield, because it is bigger than this picture. If you are careful enough, he can hold up a Skrall and more easily Atakus. His torso is completely custom: no Piraka torsos, no Inika torsos, no Toa Mahri Kongu torsos. He had to have either a Toa Metru lower torso or Vahki lower torso, and like what they chose, I like the Vahki type. His chest armor looks like the small version to me and I like the way they used an Inika foot and Mahri armor plates. His arms are the only thing that are not that pose-able.

pros:
Keetorange and black color scheme.
Scarab shield halves.
New scarab shield has a brilliant design.
Pose-able.
Completely custom design.
Golden 2008 Ignika.
Giant ""Stinger Sword""

cons:
Bit yellow.
Head sticks up.

Get him before 2010 if you want him because he is a limited edition.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2010-01-24T12:08:55.513Z","Amazing, it's a shame he was never in story","This is one of the best Bionicle sets. I wanted this purely for the Golden Ignika, but it has much, much more features than that. It includes Mata Nui's sword from The Legend Reborn, never before made in a set, but strangely the set only includes half of the scarab sheild. Click must have been ripped in half. :P

Also in the half-sheild is a Thornax Launcher with only one Thornax, as always. Toa Mata Nui (Or Titan Mata Nui, as I call him) has exactly the same shoulder spikes as the smaller set, strangely, and has a slightly similar foot and upper arm build as the 2008 Takanuva. He is really bulky and generally looks like a Great Spirit.

Titan Mata Nui has two Life Counters, which makes him the same strength as Tuma, who is much smaller than him.

It's a shame the Titan version of Mata Nui was never in story, as Greg Farshtey could have easily put him in.

This is a truely brilliant set, a definate 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Dragon_Master_48","2012-06-01T22:57:37.947Z","The Magnificant Toa Mata Nui Goes Into Combat...","<p>This set, <strong>8998 Toa Mata Nui</strong>,&nbsp;towers over many others after it is fully assembled, and is one of the many shining gems in the BIONICLE toyline.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Golden Kanohi Ignika, as well as a few other golden-colored pieces.</li><li>Very large sword and Thornax Launcher... uhh, cannon?</li><li>Many details, including the hands.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Compared to the magnificant size of the body, the head appears shrunken.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toa Mata Nui is an overall well balanced set, great for any BIONICLE collections seeking completion, or anything that needs to be added for them.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"KodakKid365","2010-09-09T18:04:59.79Z","Pure awesomeness in a box","As I said, Mata Nui is awesome. The only con is that the sword dosen't fit that well with the hand.He is very big and bulky. He's even bigger than Takanuva. he should be any collectors most wanted bionicle.",FALSE,5,5,5,4,4
"bionicle212","2011-02-19T12:47:44.793Z","one of the most awesome bionicles ever made!","<p>one word...HUGE! it's as tall as kardas! ( I don't own kardas but I looked it up on youtube.) Im not sure if it's bigger than ultimate dume, I would compare them, but ultimate dume was dismantled. one of my favorite things about this set is the gold kanohi ignika. (mask of life.) and when I first got this set, I wasn't crazy about the mix of differnt yellows and gold, but i've come to like it. and before I go to the pros/cons list, for all of you who want a ""click"" beetle, try a visorak minifig from the playsets, it's not perfect for stopmotion, but its good for display.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;HUGE! 
<li>&nbsp;useful parts such as the gold mask. </li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<li>the sword dosn't resemble the one in the movie, but and few spare parts can fix that. </li></ul>
<p>so overall, if you collect bionicles buy this set. it gets 5 stars!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Remixatron","2016-11-26T06:17:54.28Z","The gaps in the upper torso? ","<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The golden mask of life</li>
	<li>The gigantic sword</li>
	<li>Lots of parts (If you&#39;d use him for parts)</li>
	<li>Nice looking cannon</li>
	<li>Sturdy&nbsp;legs&nbsp;</li>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The gaps&nbsp;in the torso&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The head is too small for the body</li>
	<li>The waist and arms look scrawny compared to the upper torso and the legs</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I think its a good set but the one problem is were the body and the legs connect. It doesn&#39;t look armored at all and really bland.</p>
