"thewish","2009-12-20T02:54:36.89Z","STAP","Got this with the Daily Mirror promotion. If you can't get this, the EXACT SAME THING comes with the AT-TE (Clone Wars) Walker, so it's not a giant disaster if you missed the promotion.

PROS-
Battle Droid
Great Playability
Good for customising
Stays together well

CONS-
No weapon for droid

You won't regret buying this. Great set for (almost) free.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2010-09-29T05:08:07.45Z","I really don't like those blue STAPs","I've never liked blue. and when they put blue on a STAP, I just went yuck! OK, maybe not so bad, but I still dont think it suits it. As for the actual playability and other stuff Lego jargan, its not a bad set. If you got tons of these then I would strangle you with a bunch a sheeps intestines because I just couldnt get over the huge amount of blue. But the droid is cool and the build of the STAP itself isnt to disimalar to that of the old one, which I really liked (it was also because it was brown). Brown suits suits STAPs more George Lucas, so chuck out blue while you can.",FALSE,4,4,4,4,4
