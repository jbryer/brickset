But let me answer a few key questions first:

Q. Can the tiles on the Tic Tac Toe plate be removed?
A. Yes, I did it, but the plate of course is glued

Q. Are they regular minifigs?
A. I believe so, I have done an anatomy analysis on selected minifigs 

Q. Is it fun to play with?
A. if you really play Tic Tac Toe with it, it is definitely boring. But there can be other ways...

"Zuma","2011-03-16T07:35:51.897Z","Great for pirate army building","<p>I brought this set not for playing tic tac toe, but for the 10 minfigs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10 minfigs in this set, for under Â£15 make it great value, all the minfigs have weapons, which means it is better than the pirate battle pack which has&nbsp;4 minifgs and 2 weapons. </p>
<p>5 Imperials and 5 pirates including blackbeard and a female pirate&nbsp;have nothing unusual about them that is not repeated in other pirate sets. There are no other pieces like treasure chests, parrots, and monkeys. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to build your pirate/imperial armies then this is the set to get to do it at a reasonable cost.&nbsp;Alternatively you could play tic tac toe on it, as the board and display box are very good, but not much buildability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I find it very good value for money - better than the actual pirate battle pack, and this set alone has a lot of playability in itself, and what it can add to other pirate sets. </p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
