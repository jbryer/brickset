How Lego can justify making someone pay 18 to 20 dollars for just 5 mini figures is beyond me. I understand that they may have had to do some extra production to get some of the older figurines and those designs. But please... when you could get packs of 6 mini figures completely armed with several accessories for a range of 6 to 8 dollars in the 80's and early 90's, I have a really hard time with how inflated these prices are when you compare it to regular sets that have not gone up 300% or so like the mini-figure ones have.

I hope that not many buy this set and Lego reconsiders the prices. Don't get me wrong, Lego is the best toy. I would never spend more than 10 dollars on a set like this though and I hope no one else does. 

It's a major pro and great thing to get an opportunity to get these mini-figures, but the price average of more than $3.00 each is ridiculous. And then I don't want to be a complete buzz kill, but then it is not even accurate. The 1984 traditional classic blue space mini figure has the more modern space helmet and not the ones from 1984. That is fine with me, but if they truly wanted to bring the historical aspect, they should find a way to produce the original space helmet.
But if you have a great amount of disposable income, I suppose you should buy as many of these as you can.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"samuraiturtle","2010-01-01T14:54:28.343Z","Series Four","My first question is: What is it with Classic Space?  Every one of these set has one of these guys if not more.  

The main reason I got this set was for the Forest-Man and first Black-Tron figure (since i do not have that many of those two). And the Santa and first castle man are good bonus (I do not have either of those guys).  I like I said the blue spaceman is not that big of a deal for me (since I used to have a couple of them, but I do not remember if any where in blue).  

Taking out my feelings this set is pertly average.  It could of been a couple of bucks cheaper in my book.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
