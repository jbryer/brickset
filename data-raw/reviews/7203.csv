I had glimpsed pics and hints of this set being released this summer, but having not seen it at Lego S@H I thought it might have been cancelled.  However, upon seeing at a Toys R Us I decided to pick it up.  Usually you might get a large summer release, then a medium-large release, but this is the size of the 8265 Front Loader, and it is very uncharacteristic of Lego to release 3 large Technic sets in the summer.  It is divided up into 2 sections, the Tractor and the Trailer.  The Tractor very much resembles the alternate Tractor model in set #8284 from 2006, although I like the coloring in this tractor better, and I don't know about you all, but the spinning blade attachment on 8284 was in a word, HORRIBLE.  It never seemed to work right, almost impossible to get the gears to mesh and both blades to spin.  This model has a removable trailer which is manually operated up and down using a gear wheel on the trailer and a linear actuator.  It is too bad there is no way of motorizing the actuator with Power Functions, but I am sure many Technic fans will find a way.  The tractor has a straight in-line 4 cylinder engine and here's the odd part, it has the old style differential from 2006 and prior models, at least my set and the inventory in the back listed the old differential.  We saw the new differential pop up in the 8297 Off Roader last summer, and with both 8258 and 8265 this year, so it kind of surprised me that they included the old diff.  I am guessing this model might have been in the works or production for quite a while and they already had it packaged with the old style diffs.  The alternate model looks rather strange, it contains the same tractor, but with a different style trailer, looks kind of like a land groomer, but since Lego hasn't included alternate model instructions for a couple of years now, and their website doesn't even list this set, there is no way to download them anyway.  

Either way, it does seem like an inexpensive (for them) rehash of the 8284 Tractor and just adding a trailer, but it was kind of nice to have 3 large Technic models to purchase this summer.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Matt_mason","2010-12-19T17:06:44.837Z","This set is Big ","I have just finished this set and I enjoyed the build. It is an interesting build and I like the clever use of some parts. The one thing that struck me when I had finished was the size of the model it is huge. I have it on a glass shelf next to my 8052 container truck and it towers over it. I can recommend this set and if you enjoy it half as much as I did it is money well spent. P.S enjoy.<div><br></div><div>Matt</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"SenatorBlutarsky","2011-01-29T15:53:40.337Z","Nice set, but could have been better","<p>I managed to pick this set up new&nbsp;for less than $60, so at least in my case, it was a very good value for the money.&nbsp; The set consists of a tractor (very similar to the one in set 8284) and a detachable trailer.&nbsp; <br/>The building experience was pretty good on the whole, but assembling all of the panels in the trailer got a little repetitive.&nbsp; As others have noted, when this is fully assembled and hooked together, it is huge -- over 2 feet long.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The functions included in this set are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hood on the tractor can be raised to expose a working L4 engine. 
<li>The rear axle of the tractor&nbsp;has a differential which drives both the L4 engine and the PTO (power take-off) in the rear. 
<li>The PTO can be switched on and off via a lever in the tractor's cab. 
<li>The tractor has a 2-point hitch in the rear that may be raised/lowered via a gear-knob at the rear of the cab. 
<li>The tractor has front-wheel rack-and-pinion steering (via a gear-knob on the top of the cab). 
<li>The front axle of the tractor, while not a fully independent suspension, has the ability to tilt to allow the tractor to negotiate uneven terrain with all four wheels on the ground. 
<li><em>[I'm not sure whether this counts as a function but I'll include it for&nbsp;the sake of being complete]</em>&nbsp; The seat in the tractor cab can be reclined. 
<li>The bed of the trailer can be raised to dump its cargo via a set of gear-knobs on either side of the undercarriage of the trailer. 
<li>The trailer has a stand that can be deployed via a lever mechanism that keeps the trailer upright when it is not attached to the tractor. 
<li></li></ul>
<p>Not a bad set of functions, but it would really have been nice if the PTO were actually used to drive something.&nbsp; I may try to modify this model to see if there is a way to have the PTO drive the raising/lowering of the trailer bed.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Still, this set is pretty good overall.&nbsp; You get a nice set of parts, including a decent assortment of gears, one linear actuator, the parts for the L4 engine, and plenty of red beams and green panels.&nbsp; If you can find it for a decent price, I'd definitely recommend it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
"martiniman","2014-06-05T08:09:27.467Z","Not very well executed 8284 remake. Tractor itself remains excellent though.","<p>I have the 8284 Tractor from 2006, and I gathered the additional needed pieces to build this 2009 variation. The 8284 was IMO the best Technic Tractor ever, so what to say about this one?</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>No box this time. I just got the extra needed bricks on Bricklink to build it from my 8284 set.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set is noticeable for the large number of green flat panels. 13 pieces. The other Technic set with this panel is the 42008 Service Truck. It will give you 5 of these.</p>

<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p>

<p>The tractor looks awesome. It is huge and looks realistic. I don&#39;t like the colour scheme as much as with the 8284 though. The colours of the trailer are great, yet with the lime green 8284 tractor in front the total set looks even better than with the red tractor. The original was a spot on Claas tractor copy. Now it is probably a Massey Ferguson.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8063-2.jpg"" /></p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The build is medium complex, and very fun. There is a large bunch of gears in the base with nice complexity. The trailer is pretty straightforward. Especially the bed has some repetition.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The 8063 has some problems. As it is the 8284 in different colours with some slight adaptions to the tractor itself, with a different add-on behind, it has some sort of identity crisis. This does not make it a bad tractor though! The tractor itself works perfect and invites to create awesome add-ons. The lifting mech, the PTO axle, all work great. The trailer though does not use them!</p>

<p>The trailer has 2 flaws: the linear actuator is having an awkward mech to push up the trailer bed. You need to help it to get up! That is a serious flaw. The second problem is that the PTO axle is not used. I decided to make a slight modification: fix the lifting mech and use the PTO. See the included pictures on the execution of this mod. It is still not ideal, because the PTO is driven by the wheels, not by the motor, so in my version the bed comes up when you drive forward. It is fun though. I also left the manual override knobs (switch off the PTO lever on the tractor to use those). The adaption of the lifting arms result in much smoother raising of the bed. It does not get stuck in the down position, and it can go a little higher as well.</p>

<p>A minor aesthetic issue is the use of truck wheels. They look too square on a tractor. I used the small tractor wheels instead, even though they are a little bit on the small side.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Although it is the 8284&#39;s lesser brother, strange when you consider it is a 3 year later remake which are usually better, the tractor itself is awesome and together with the trailer it looks great. The trailer functions are very bad implemented and need a fix. It is a relative easy fix. If you have no Technic tractor, first try to find a 8284. If you can have a good deal on the 8063, go ahead and grab this one. It is nearly identical, you get a lot of extra parts: a good amount of red and dark grey beams and 13! green panels. It will be easy to make the good working and fun grass collector from the 8284 with your other parts as add-on.</p>

<p><strong>Modification</strong></p>

<p>Here are some pics to give you inspiration on how to adjust the trailer. First is a modification to have the actuator work right and make it able to get the bed up:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8063-3.jpg"" /></p>

<p>I was missing the 2 3x3 L-frames with snaps, I replaced them and the connected 7-hole red beam with a normal square frame:</p>

<p><img alt=""Bottom frame"" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8063-4.jpg"" style=""width: 1000px; height: 665px;"" /></p>

<p>On the tractor site you have to make a small modification to make the PTO axle work with a flexible coupling. The used axle is 0.5 unit too long.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8063-5.jpg"" style=""width: 1000px; height: 665px;"" /></p>

<p>And now a couple of images of the modification of the lifting knobs. You will see the knobs are still there and working. If the PTO lever on the tractor is &quot;on&quot;, driving the tractor forward will raise the bed. If the PTO lever is &quot;off&quot;, you can do it manually.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8063-6.jpg"" style=""width: 1334px; height: 667px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8063-7.jpg"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8063-8.jpg"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8063-9.jpg"" /></p>

<p>A final nice mod would be if you can reverse the PTO axle on the tractor. That requires a mod of the tractor gearing though. Maybe it would be great to combine that with adding powerfunctions as well.</p>
