The new style helmet for the AT-AT driver is amazing, as well as the new imperial officer. The little base is OK, it provides a satellite and a rotating missle launcher.

"legoclone","2009-12-21T12:03:45.107Z","Good set but would have liked one more snowtrooper. ","This is a decent kit to build your Army but I just wish that in these battle packs Lego would give you 3 of the basic soldiers and 1 special mini-fig like they did with last year's clone trooper pack.  That one was perfect because you could collect a lot of clone troopers quicker with multiple sets and thus could fill the various vehicles like the Gunship and AT-TE with troopers.  Don't get me wrong with this one, I DO like the AT-AT driver, however,  I just don't need a bunch of AT-AT drivers if I buy multiple sets (especially seeing as how the AT-AT comes with one anyways) and thus would rather have that extra snow trooper with each kit instead.  Please keep this in mind Lego if you're ever going to do another battle pack with Episode III clone troopers. 

Anyways, the speeder bike is really cool.  The other thing...well, it leaves you some good parts for the spare parts box including a decent radar screen and missile and an imperial officer to help command your various imperial forces.  I intend to put him in the Endor set's Scout Walker (which really should have come with its own AT-ST driver). ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"18000pieces","2009-12-29T12:59:08.047Z","TWO extras? Astonishing!","For the first time since the original Clone BP, we get two whole extras! And they're both good! It's wondrous! But anyway, here's an analysis of all of the BP's aspects:


--Minifigures - There's a wide assortment for a BP, only two being the same. The snowtroopers aren't new, just rather rare, and it's nice to have two of them in a cheap set. 

However, LEGO must be trying to keep them relatively scarce, as instead of having a third one manning the turret, they've employed an AT-AT driver, oddly removed from his AT-AT. The helmet is rather bulky, but the torso is nice. 

Last but not least, we have the imperial officer, with his ever-so-stylish 'durasteel sheperd headwrap' look and incomprehensible rank symbol. He's got a generic IJ Nazi head, but the facial expression fits him well. His nose must be getting pretty chilly, though. Oh, wait, he doesn't have a nose. Works for him!


--Snow Speeder - it uses the tricycle mold, similar to Battle of Endor, but in with a white top. That forms the main part of the build, really. The front utilizes two of the new headlight pieces with a stud on the side in white, which are something of an improvement over the old version, although they don't have holes in the back. There's an old-school megaphone gun on one side.

--Base - Only the second stationary BP component so far, the first one being the turret in the original clone BP, the 'base' is... interesting. It looks sort of like something that could have been dropped from the belly of a modified AT-AT, I guess. 

The radar station half is simply adorable, although I don't see what use it would be as far as tactics go. It comes with a printed piece, though! And clips for holding the guns are a plus.

The turret comes clost to having a play feature, the ability to angle the missile by turning the gear on the other side. The angle is restricted to an arc of about 45 degrees, and it's impossible to flick it properly when it's pointing up, but it's the though that counts. It certainly looks better pointing up than pointing out. The entire turret can rotate well too, and I'll never say no to another trans-red tile (future blood!). The missile itself is a nice departure from the usual two-piece flickfire, although it often comes apart.

--Accessories - The only place where this set disappoints is the number of blasters - one long one, two short, and that's it. One of 'em has to go unarmed. Maybe veers can smash the rebels over the head with his binoculars.

--Box - normally I wouldn't include a section for this, but I would just like to say that it bugs the HECK out of me that the box has clones on it. It makes me want to slap George Lucas in the face.

All in all, it's a nice little set, well worth the $11, useful for dioramas or just playing around. I look forward to getting the rebel BP to pair up with it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Niallskie","2009-12-30T04:05:11.297Z","Speeder army to come.","  Got this set today at our local Target for just $10.99, good thing I did not picked up this set at a TRU last week that was jacked up to $14.99, which I thought was the actual retail price of 2010 BP. Awesome thing is that it started to snow after I got this set as well as the 8083, opened them right off the bath and posed them in the snow doing battle.

  On to the review, I love this set as much as the 8083. All 4 figures are awesome, love the extra 2 Snow Trooper specially for a set this cheap. I'm not sure if the Snow Trooper back pack design is new (haven't compared it with the old one) but it looks fantastic. The Imperial Officer is also cool, love the head gear as well as the torso print which is almost the same as the Snow Troopers. The AT-AT driver is kinda out of place for me as there is no AT-AT to drive on this set LOL, but it's an addition that is welcome to this set specially the helmet is a new design. Helmet looks a tad bigger than usual but it does not matter as it still looks cute like the anime chibi (which I think the lego minifigures are meant to be cute). The small base is as good as it gets, compromised with the small amount of bricks the set have it's a good build. Radar station is cool with the blaster rack on the side, missile torret is also fantastic, only thing I did not like is that the missile is either pointed straight or at a 45 degree angle. Would have been nice too if the put a chair piece there than none at all. Now the speeder bike, who doesn't like a speeder bike I tell you, and with this cheap set you can build an army of it too. For me this is the best speeder design as of yet, and you can only get this from the past year's sets were from Echo Base and the Republic Gunship. At ebay as well the sell these from the previous sets sell's from $8-$10 a piece. Now it is available for a  measly $10.99 with 4 other minifigures and small base.

"Da_LegoBuilder","2009-12-31T14:03:32.39Z","snowtroopers have entered the base!","I bought 3 of these sets for $16 USD at Toys R Us, but don't be fooled, you can get it cheaper for $11 at Target, or just buy it directly at the Lego Store. I saw a guy buying 9 of each battle pack, and he was pretty smart, here are the reasons why:
Pros:
-Introducing 2 new minifigs, the AT-AT pilot and the imperial officer. This AT-AT pilot is totally different from the 2007 AT-AT pilot. Believe me, this looks better than the 2007 one. The new addition is the imperial officer, which is totally different than the AT-ST pilot and imperial officer minifigs in the past. 
-It comes with a speeder, and it looks pretty sweet. has a good color scheme, which is white, and grey, that can blend with the surroundings on Hoth!
Cons:
-What troubled me the most was the imperial outpost. The officers is hiding behind the controls looking through his bionoculars, and right next to him, an AT-AT pilot manning a harpoon gun! Definately not an outpost, and another small flaw which is not seen on the box: The white bricks where the officer is hiding behind is not completed, and one of the bricks is actually controls. As everyone knows, a control brick is a slanted 2x2 brick, which sits on top of 2 other bricks. Unfortuately, a corner of the 2x2 brick sticks out, which is a major flaw in the set. if you haven't noticed, this set is 5 bricks less than the rebel battle pack, they could have just added in a white 1x1 brick to fill in the corner!
-Another flaw was the harpoon gun, or the huge missle launcher. extremely bulky. you can aim the gun, but it can fall of, because the end piece isn't sealed off. for me, while i was checking out this new set, the missle kept sliding off of the long stick that holds it. The designer must have never thought of it.

Personally, the set is not bad, a great army builder, and you can set it up like on the battle of hoth. My sets are set up right now, in battle style in the display case. It goes well with the 2007 AT-AT, 2007 Echo Base, and the 2009 Echo Base. Right now it is displayed with all of these sets. I encourage you to buy it, despite the minor flaws, with a little modifying and tweaking, you can make it a pretty awesome set, maybe even worth to buy 9 of these! :)

One other review complained they had black heads, not sure what he was expecting but that's what shines through the white helmet...

Speeder, same as endor set but white and just great, absolutely love it and it works with the figure I guess because we saw speeders in the movie.

The imperial station or mini base is not bad at all way better than the awful 'ice cutter for the rebel battle pack, but then baddies always have the fun and cool equipment. The missile I love, very cool indeed.

"chavez247","2010-02-13T08:48:33.263Z","March of the Empire!","I just picked up this set along with the Hoth Trooper Battle Pack, and despite the outrageous prices(CHF 25.90 for each), I`m very pleased. I`m trying to recreate the battle on Hoth, and these battle packs will really help. This little beauty comes with four figures, a small outpost(emphasis on small), and a white speeder.

The figures are all good. As I mentioned before, there are four of them: two snowtroopers, an AT-AT driver, and a grey Death Star Trooper. The snowtroopers are good, and are worth having since they're fairly rare, coming in only a handful of sets, a majority of which are pretty expensive. They're the same as all the other snowtroopers released; a head piece with a backpack attached, a white torso, white arms, and white legs. The heads are black.
The AT-AT driver is a gem. Found only in the AT-ATs(well, duh), he is exceptionally rare. He is of a new mold, with a large, detailed helmet that has two Imperial insignias on it. The torso has some sort of life support pack depicted on it, and then just regular old grey legs. As with all stormtroopers, there is a black head.

Finally, we have the Death Star Trooper. He is the same as any other one of his kind, except he is all grey. Grey helmet, grey body, grey legs, grey arms. On his torso he has a sort of plate, or chest protector. 

Then we have the small outpost. It comes on a small white plate, and consists of a radar and a small cannon. There is a radar piece with nice detail and a radar dish. Under that there are two gun holders. And next to that we have the cannon. It's basically a holder that can be moved by a cog joined to it by an axle. This is on a small plate resting on top of one of those spinning plates. The missile is flick-fire and looks quite nice. There is a sort of seat for the operator. There are some good pieces here, either transparent red or white.
Last, but not least, the speeder. It's pretty much the same as the ones in The Battle of Endor and the Republic Attack Gunship. However, it's white and grey, not brown, and the front rods with the two small flat plates are not just straight but like the old lances in the castle sets.
This set comes with a pair of macrobinoculars, two blasters, and two blaster rifles.
Overall, a great set, worth buying doubles of(as I plan to do), and a great army builder. I shall end this review with the pros and cons.

Pros:

AT-AT driver
Snowtroopers
Imperial trooper
Neat little outpost
Speeder
Great army builder
Good flick-fire missile
Some rare pieces

Cons:

None

"SkyBrick","2010-01-18T11:31:49.7Z","Great Set!","I bought this set for $10.99 at Meijer. It is a great set! It was fun to build and has a very good amount of minifigures for $10.99. Interesting to note that the minifigures almost parallel with those of the Clone Walker Battle Pack: Two troopers for battle (Snowtroopers), one gunner (AT-AT Driver), and one commander (Imperial Officer). The set comes with the new speeder bike, which has a cool smooth-looking design. It also comes with a mini-base complete with radar, blaster holders, and a small flick-fire missile launcher platform. The minifigures include two snowtroopers, which is pretty cool since before you could only get snowtroopers in more expensive sets, like the AT-AT Walkers and the Hoth Millenium Falcon. The other two minifigures are a AT-AT Driver and Imperial Officer. Both are cool, especially a real Imperial officer to command your troops, but the AT-AT Driver's (very well detailed) helmet seems a little big compared to the rest of the body. 

Pros--

-Great value for money.
-Fun to play with if you have some Rebel troopers.
-Cool minifigures.
-Sweet speeder bike.

Cons--

-Flick-fire missile launcher is not very easy to fire efficiently, however, if you want to use it as a gun or just pull out the missile to make it hit its target, it works fine for that too. 
-AT-AT Driver's head seems a little big in proportion with the rest of the body.

"ceroknight","2010-05-29T20:41:28.763Z","Good Addition to a Hoth Set But....Not a Good Set Itself......","<p>I got the last one in my local Walmart and here is what I have to say about it:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures/Accessories:</h4>
<p>AMAZING minifigs: two snowtroopers, an AT-AT pilot and an Imperial officer. The redesigned AT-AT helmet is MASSIVE and alot of the back is exposed. Snowies are just amazing and the officer is quite chill.<br />
The accessories are kinda off as there was one less weapon and I dont know why there is a backpack on the speeder.....<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Building:</h4>
<p>Building was decent but that was because this was only a battlepack....anyhow this is my first speeder but I had built the Endor one for my local TRU (happened to be at the right place at the right time :-P) and this one seems less detailed. However I love the colour scheme. The base was easy to build and it isnt so bad....<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Playability: <br />
&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Like I mentioned before this would be good if it was in a set like the upcoming AT-AT (it would explain the Pilot too) There isn't much functions in it and you can't really recreate the movie because I haven't see these in it.....<br />
<br />
By the way my ratings are .5 off because I dont know how to do a half a brick so this is what I thought: Overall:4.5 Building:3.5 Parts:4.5 Playability: 3.5 Value:4.5<br />
<br />
Its a good set go get it!!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,4

Celui-ci est intéressant&nbsp;: 2 snowtroopers, l'officier, et le pilote du AT-ST. Le speeder bike des neiges est franchement top, une merveille. Par la suite, j'en ai acheté 5 de plus pour constituer un petit détachement.</p>
<p>Comme la plupart, je&nbsp;m'interroge devant la pauvreté du&nbsp;missile.&nbsp;Quel intérêt a-t-il ? On se le demande. Vous imaginez les gars poser ça directement dans la neige (scène d'intro de l'Empire Contre-Attaque)&nbsp;au milieu du blizzard ? Non, pas crédible. Un 2ème speeder bike eut été plus adéquat pour justifier le prix.</p>
<p>A ce sujet, à quand des lots spéciaux uniquement composés de mini-figurines de l'Empire ou de la République, troopers et clones, afin que les fans puissent facilement constituer leur armée ? Lego devrait y réfléchir, ces lots spéciaux se vendraient comme des petits pains et raviraient les fans. Rien n'est impossible, depuis 1999 cette gamme a connu une belle évolution.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-15T11:55:18.757Z","Lord Vader you may Start your Approach","<p>Set #8084 Snowtrooper Battle Pack: LEGO Star Wars Battle Packs continue to impress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Snowtrooper Battle Pack gives us three things, an Imperial Speeder Bike for Hoth, more Snowtroopers, more Imperial AT-AT Drivers and an Imperial Commander. Four Mini-Figures make up the bulk of the reason for picking this set up, the vehicle isn't bad either, but I have to wonder privately at that small weapons outpost with rocket launcher... When did they have time to make one of those during the Hoth Attack?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This build is surprisingly fast, my set was missing a piece unfortunately and I'm not sure if it was due to the fact that I started building it in the parking lot while waiting for my ride home or if it was because that part is missing from the set at the factory level... I'll have to pick up a second one to know for sure. (And I had a spare of that piece anyway, the little black nozzle part, so I'm covered in case that happens again.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this is a great Battle Pack and a worthy addition to the 30th Anniversary of Empire Strikes Back, there are a lot more uses for multiples of this set than the Hoth Rebel Troopers one, since four of the three Mini-Figures are generic and the fourth one is simply called AT-AT Commander/Imperial Commander so you could use multiples of him anywhere really. Strongly Recommended for Hoth and Empire fans.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"wander099","2011-02-01T16:53:48.057Z","Terrible missile","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is nice, you get a clear picture of the snow speeder.&nbsp; As for the instructions, they are fairly simple, just like the new Clone Trooper Battle Pack.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Nothing too special here except for the main body of the speeder.&nbsp; There are no stickers and you get one printed piece.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This is what the battle packs are all about.&nbsp; You get four: two snow troopers, one imperial officer, and one AT-AT pilot.&nbsp; The best figure in this set is the AT-AT driver, he's got great markings on his helmet and torso and is only available in this set and the expensive AT-AT walker set.&nbsp; The imperial officer is also pretty good, this version is exclusive to this set so far and in my opinion one of the better versions.&nbsp; The snowtroopers are pretty good (a cheap way to add a couple more to your army), my only complaint is that the backpacks are attached to the helmets and cannot be removed.&nbsp; It doesn't really hinder play, it just annoys me.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fast and pretty easy.&nbsp; Younger kids will be able to do it (I know a 7 year old who managed to build this one by himself, without any help).<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is pretty good.&nbsp; The speeder sits nicely on the table and is a great design.&nbsp; I like the way the hand controls are designed (same as in the Clone Trooper battle pack for this year), but I'm not sure why the speeder is not entirely symmetrical (on one side there is a black cone piece, like the pieces used for the old guns, but on the other there isn't).</p><p>As for the base, it looks nice and the missile rotates (laterally and vertically), but the flick fire missile is terrible (worst one I have encountered so far).&nbsp; I simply cannot get the missile to fire how it is supposed to, it requires picking up the base and applying a great deal of force.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would recommend this battle pack despite the failing of the flickfire missile.&nbsp; At $14.99 CDN it is a relatively cheap set and what it does include makes it worth the price you pay.&nbsp; The figures alone make this worth buying and with a great speeder like this you can't go wrong.&nbsp; The base looks nice, so it can still be played with without the flickfire missile function (you can still aim it and pretend to fire).&nbsp; This set is good for young kids, older kids, and adults as all age groups will find something about this set to be great (whether it is the easy build, minifigures, speeder, base, or a combination of the above).<br></p>",TRUE,4,2,3,3,4
"Steamrunner","2011-01-02T21:29:49.707Z","Ingenious use of parts","Bought one of these in the Argos sale for a Star Wars-loving mate as a desk toy, and decided to get one for myself too.<br><br>The choice of characters is a bit odd - the AT-AT bloke looks totally out of place, as does the Officer chap - the others are all in arctic gear and he's supposedly out in the snow in hos regular suit? And the ""base station"" thing just looks like a few bricks stuck together. It's going in the parts bin. Oh, and why on earth do the blokes with cloths over their faces only get black heads? Why not normal heads with faces? We know they have faces, they're not robots! The AT-AT bloke gets a face even though he wears a full helmet, so why not the other two?<br><br>However, the speeder is a lovely bit of design, and I'm really impressed with the clever use of pieces. From what I can see, they've used road signs for the plates at the front, lances (?) for the front end, robot arms and fire hose handles for the control levers (very clever) and a motorbike chassis on skis for the rest of it. Not bad at all!<br><br>If the set was, say, two speeders but a couple of quid less, I think it'd be much better. As it is, the base thing is just weird, but if you get it in a sale it's worth it for the speeder. Don't pay full price for it, though.<br>",TRUE,2,3,2,2,2

<p>Honestly, not too many parts can be used from this set. Most have been seen before.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>?This is a battle pack, so clearly the minifigures are in the spotlight! The Snowtrooper design from back then was perfect. They&#39;re perfect even now in 2015, but back then, I really wanted a Snowtrooper figure without having to purchase one of the larger sets to get one. You also got a now inaccurate AT-AT Driver, who still is a fantastic figure. Lastly you get an imperial officer in a Hoth outfit, which was surprising, but not a. Bad inclusion for this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Build was super quick, I enjoyed building the Snowtrooper speeder the most.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I got this set and never looked back. I got two snowtroopers, and a couple of cool extras!&nbsp;</p>
