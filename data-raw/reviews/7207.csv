"yodaccm","2009-12-19T16:08:35.577Z","A Surprisingly Good Set!","When I first saw this set here on Brickset, I knew I had to get it.  I'm not sure what about it caught my eye first:  the new Talz chieftain minifig, the cool new winter garb for Anakin, or the sweet, sleek new speeder from the Clone Wars series.

First, I have to groan about the ridiculous $35 price tag for a set that only has 177 pieces.  That is the only thing that kept me from giving this set the coveted ""5"" rating.  

The speeder itself is a nice design.  The big engines on the back really give it some heft, it has three runners on the bottom and a nice little storage compartment concealed behind the cockpit.  As for the cockpit, it is not entirely enclosed.  However, Lego has finally fixed the problem with cockpit domes constantly breaking off when trying to open them by making the connection point connect to 4 studs instead of the usual 2.  Hooray!

As for the minifigs, they are top notch.  Anakin new torso is great with a nice Republic emblem emblazoned on it as does the new hood he is sporting.  His head is two sided, one being the regular Clone Wars Anakin face, and the other being a wind whipped, frost bitten, goggled version which adds some variety.

The Talz cheiftain, named Thi-Sen, is a nice addition to the growing family of Star Wars alien minifigs.  It is always a pleasure to see new, less exposed characters from the movies or cartoons getting minifigs.  However, these new minifigs may explain the outrageous price tag.

All in all the Freeco speeder is a nice set, especially for the wintery holidays!  It fits in nicely with the Hoth sets that have been trickling in these past few years.  I picked mine up at TRU this past week, so start looking for them on the shelves and pick one up!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Camo_Hat","2009-12-25T23:14:11.967Z","Awesome new characters....... check!","I got this set for christmas and i built it immediatly.

Build:
nice build. the instructions could have been a bit more detailed about where you put things, but other than that agreat build. it was not to difficult but not to easy.

Speeder:
a nice additiion to the grouping of speeders LEGO has come out with. there is a storage area to hold an electrobinocular and anakins lightsaber handle but once again there is no place for the sword part so it just sits off to the side until anakin needs it.

Characters:
Anakin is awesome. he comes in a parka and has a two sided head. i know your going to say this is a bad point but the other side of his face has a ski mask and goggles which is just awesome if you ask me. thi sen is the best part of the set. not only is he exclusive to this set but he is also a LEGO star wars alien which is great for me because i collect Lego star wars aliens. anyone got a geonosian? thi sen is the icing on the cupcake but they could have included the senator from pantora or something.

Overall:
a great set and definently worth getting. 4 out of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"THX_1138","2010-01-01T12:30:51.153Z","Very Nice!","This is an awesome set. I got incredibly lucky last night at an almost Lego-free Target after visiting about 3 Wal-Marts without any luck, finding this behind one of the light up covered Power Miners displays, probably hidden by someone wanting to come back for it later and hoping no one else would find it. I had loved the Freeco speeder design ever since I first saw it in the Clone Wars episode, and wanted to make one but couldn't think of any way to make it in minifig scale. Shortly after that, pictures of this set were appearing. I though it looked good, but a bit big.

Pros:
-Great looking.
-Thi-Sen.
-Anakin with double sided head.
-Although it has stickers, they are easy to place and look great.
-Fun, mostly non-repetative build.
-The price isn't too bad if you don't get it at Toys'R'Us, where it is $35 (everywhere else, it is $25).
-Though rather ugly, the new cockpits stay on a little better (I never had a problem with them coming off, though).
-Some good detail, like the area around the 'ice picks' (and no, those aren't actually ice picks, those are supposed to look like a small detail on the real speeder).
-It's always nice when a model has a cockpit that actually opens and doesn't just come off.

Cons:
-Horrible price if bought at TRU.
-It would look terrible if you don't apply the stickers, and would barely have any color at all aside from the red on the wings.
-The new cockpit piece is very ugly.

Overall, this is a very good set, but I think I would feel a little different about it had I gotten it at TRU. I would recommend getting it, but only at Target, Wal-Mart, Lego stores or anywhere else with a reasonable price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"baylego","2009-12-28T10:47:17.327Z","Greatest Speeder Bike Ever!"," Said in my title, this is probably the best speeder bike TLG has ever made. 

 One of the big points in this set is the minifigs. Thi-Sen is very cool, and his silver spear is very rare. Anikin is very detailed and looks a lot like the actual episode. He has an updated version of his normal face on his face on the other side of his head.
 
 The speeder is a bit blocky in the front, but is pretty aerodynamic. Underneath the white cockpit is a storage area for a few extra pieces. The two ice picks on the sides of the speeder were a very nice detail, too. This set has 4 1X2 white cheese slopes, two 1X3 white tiles and 1 1X4 white tile.

 The only thing to complain about is the price. $34.99 at TRU should be avoided at all costs. The MSRP of $24.99 is still a little high, but it might be worth it depending on what you want. Overall, I would say this set is definitely one to pick up if you don't have it already.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"frostlass","2010-01-02T11:52:48.03Z","A New Minifig!","minifigs: The minifigs are cool. There's anakin skywalker dressed up in Hoth gear with a two sided face (one side is his regular side and the other he's all dressed up in his snow gear.) and a completley new minifig, 
Thi-sen! Thi-sen is a grey monster that has four eyes. He also has a spear! I think his monster type is called a tal ( TAUL).That's how to pronounce the  word. 

            Though, the freeco speeder is cool itself. Behind the cockpit you can take off the white dome piece and under it there's a little place where Anakin stores his binoculars. His lightsaber might not fit, but, you can try because I lost mine at home.It also features an opening cockpit That doesn't break as easily off because the old two dots they use to use for cockpit has become a nice sturdy four dot cockpit! I'm pretty glad that they improved their cockpit structure a lot! The engines on the sides and the snow skis on the bottom make it look cool too!

So, if you see this set at your local target, why don't you grab one for yourself? I totally recommend this set to any star wars set and I give a *****/***** (5/5) ! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"P13c30fch33s3","2010-01-21T06:41:59.153Z","Only one MASSIVE PROBLEM","This problem is the problem that prevents me from giving this set 5*, as i believe the set without that flaw would be 10000000000000000000*. This problem is the price. $50 AUD for 177 pieces? That's worse than the 7681 Spider Droid. And that's an achievement. (A bad one, mind you). From now on, I will split the speeder up (quite literally) and review each section.

The Minifigs:
One of the main attractions of this set. Anakin is not new, but Anakin in Snow Gear is new. Anakin has a double sided face: one normal and one one full snow gear. It is virtually impossible to turn it without removing the hood, but since you wouldn't remove your goggles in a blizzard, i find it alright.
Thi Sen is a completely unique figure on the other hand, with a very large head sculpt that prevents him from bending his legs back very far. However, it is very accurate to the actual alien, and i think it looks brilliant. The spear is a great addition, beat i think they should've included a Talz club as well (for parrying the lightsabre). Overall, 10/10 for the minifigs.

The excellent new cockpit pieces + the rear storage:
The new cockpit sculpt is an improvement on the old. Although some people say they didn't have issues, I found that the original sculpt tended to be loose and sometimes fall off in violent flying manuevers. The new sculpt is square at the front and holds on much better. The storage space is more than sufficient for Anakin's lightsabre and his binoculars. The box in the back holds the binoculars and the handle, while the blade must simply be dropped in and one must 'hope' that it stays there. Overall, 7.5/10 The lack of space for the blade really lets the set down.

The Engines + a modified swivel feature:
The large outrigger engines are held onto the base plate by: technic pins and 2 2*1 1/3 plates each. holding the two 2*1 plates together on each side is a 2*1 cheese wedge, or to be technical, a 30 degree 2*1 2/3 height slope piece. This can be modified to turn the Freeco speeder into VTOL craft (vertical take-off + landing) with swivelling engines. The 2 2*1 must be turned 90 degrees in either direction, and the 2*1 cheese wedge must be kept in the same position. This allows the technic pin to swivel freely, and through it, the large engines. The engines are mainly made up of a very common but useful engine piece found in the X wing, among other sets and is the perfect size for the engines. The rear discs are held in place by hammers, like the guns on the 8019 Shuttle. Overall: 9/10 - Lego should find a way not pin stuff together with the hammer.

The rear plates:
Nothing special, but it is sturdy and and holds the other parts together well. 10/10

The long Nose Cone + Ice Picks + Cockpit area:
This section is the longest part of the set. The Nose itself is nothing special Although it does make use of 2*4 2/3 curved pieces. At the rear of the nose cone, there are two ice picks. Their purpose in that position eludes me, but what I can tell you is that it could probably tear apart anything in the way. The cockpit is a problem. Although the cockpit piece is excellent, the minifigure inside is exposed at the bottom, just above the 1*3 tiles. This is the only major problem I can see with it. Overall, 9/10, the cockpit being the only problem.

Pros:
 - accurate
 - fits minifigs easily
 - fits most accessories
 - skis do good hover effect
Cons:
 - cockpit gaps
 - no guns
 - too expensive
 - too small for price
 - lightsabre blade doesn't store properly

Overall: 9/10
Get this if you:
a) don't mind high prices
b) collect star wars
c) want new cockpit pieces (although 5981 Raid VPR is cheaper and has the cockpit)
d) can get the set for a fair price (like me)
e) desperately want the set (like i used to)
note: a combination of these is better than just one.

"TangDynasty","2010-03-01T05:47:03.7Z","Nice set except...","I have been reading the reviews here for some time and I thought I will give it a shot in writing my first review. So here goes...

My son has set his eyes on this set the moment it came out. But the price, at S$55(!) is way too much for me to pay. We managed to get it at S$45 after a discount. 

It was fairly easy to build the set for my 7 year old son. The speeder felt solid, sturdy and compact. The stickers give a good finishing touch to the speeder. The size is good and it was fun to play with. One thing to note... we have problem with getting Anakin to hold on to the handles inside the cockpit. It was cram and we ended up not having him holding the handles at all. 

Here are my pros and cons:

Pros:

- The minifigs are cool
- Nice solid feel of the speeder
- Overall nice design of the speeder

Cons:

- It's too expensive for a small set
- The cockpit looked unfinished with a huge gap

Overall, 7/10. 

It is still a nice set and the minfigs are really.

I hope my review will be able to give you some insight to the set and I hope to post more reviews in the future.

<p>This set is probably the best speeder ever designed by LEGO. Here are some details about the set.</p>
<h4>The Minifigures</h4>
<p>The are two minifigures in this set and they are Anakin Skywalker and Thi-Sen/Talz Chieftain which&nbsp;both of them are&nbsp;exclusive and unique to this set.&nbsp;Anakin Skywalker has a double sided face. One side shows his original face and the other is him with goggles and a piece of cloth over his mouth. Anakin Skywalker is wearing snow gear which is different from Han Solo's snow gear as Anakin Skywalker's has a Jedi Emblem on his hood and torso. He is also equipped with a Blue Lightsaber with the new chrome design hilt which was first introduced in 8017 Darth Vader's TIE Fighter in 2009.</p>
<p>Thi-Sen/Talz Chieftain is made up similar to Chewbacca. His head part is all one piece going over the torso. The detail on Thi-Sen/Talz Chieftain is amazing as it has all been done out of plastic and no rubber. He is equipped with a Light Pearl Spear (This colour was used in some of the 2005&nbsp;LEGO Star Wars Sets).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Speeder</h4>
<p>The speeder is quite big and is mostly white with some red Republic colouring. The speeder has two features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Opening cockpit to put Anakin Skywalker at the controls.</li>
    <li>Put Anakin Skywalkers lightsaber and electro-binoculars in the cargo hold.</li>
</ul>
<p>The set contains eight stickers/decals and some new pieces such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>2v4 white smooth plate.</li>
    <li>2v1 white slope two studs high.</li>
    <li>1v3 white smooth plate.</li>
    <li>The cockpit screen and back white screen&nbsp;has been slighty altered with a square bit in front to hold down the piece more.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Overall Review With Pros &amp; Cons</h4>

    <li>Well Designed Set!</li>
    <li>New Pieces!</li>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Looks pretty good when built, esp. if the stickers are properly aligned and placed.</li><li>Not necessarily cheap but not so expensive that your wife will say ""no way"".</li><li>Does supposedly have a unique Anakin figure. &nbsp;This may be extra appealing if you like minifigs in parkas.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Price per brick is fairly high.</li><li>No where to store Anakin's lightsabre. &nbsp;Maybe Thi-Sen can hold it for him?</li><li>Gaps between the windscreen and everything else. &nbsp;Chilly.</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>Most importantly, I suppose, is the fact that this admittedly fairly small and somewhat overpriced set has me now with a lego.com account, reading reviews on brickset, checking out deals on sets on ebay, amazon and allego (Poland's big auction site) and generally thinking a lot about how to spend significant portions of future paychecks. &nbsp;It's difficult to pin-point what about this set did it for me but there was just something about it. &nbsp;I do not suspect the same experience will be had by others but I'm glad it was mine.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,3
