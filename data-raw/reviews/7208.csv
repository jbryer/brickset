"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-12-13T16:51:54.747Z","Very nice battle pack, nice build","Alright, I know, coming from a 79 piece set, yeah there's not much to build. What's included for what you pay for, is. First, though, is the focus of the battle pack concept: minifigures. Compared to the most recent edition of a Rebel based battle pack from 2008, this one shakes it up. New torsos and helmets, along with the new-concept visors and new faces give the Rebels some variety, and the thing that really sold it to me: Zev Senesca. Sure, a named pilot who actually never fought on the ground in the battle (he was shot down), but what I'm really looking at is the make of him. LEGO decided to update the Rebel Pilot, obviously with goggles and a new helmet, but a double sided torso that features much, much accurate details. The sole vehicle of the set makes up the rest of the build, officially an Ice Cutter from deleted scenes in Episode V, features 2 rockets and a pair of cannons plus a command chair. The thing is actually a pretty nice sized build compared the the already seen speeder bike (which is just 7676 and 8038's in white form) and a little command center. Pick up the set, it's worth every penny!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vwong19","2009-12-28T12:18:29.467Z","Reinforcements for the Rebels","Let's face it, when you buy this set it's all about getting more Rebel minifigs for the Empire Strikes Hoth battle.

The set is priced normally at $11 (TRU jacks up the prices).... inflation.

Pros: 
- New torsos that match other rebel solders
- New helmets
- Another pilot to the fleet

Con:
- Eyes are different from previous Star War generics. Simple smiley faces are apparently a thing of the past. Rebel officer is kinda scary.
- Price/brick ratio

Overall it's a win. The new faces are not as bad as the clone war faces.

pros:
new helmets
new pilot
turret spins 360Â°
slides good on tile floors and mast rugs
everything else

cons:
fick fire
the price at toys R us is $5 more then the real price

I say get it! Even if its a toys R us! But really get it if its $10 or less!

"yodaccm","2009-12-18T15:58:51.42Z","Only thing that holds it back is the absurd cost...","*Sigh*  I picked this up at TRU for $15.  Along with this set, I saw the TIE Defender and Freeco speeder, so go grab them just in time for the Christmas holiday!  

I suppose there is no point to continue to complain about the cost of Star Wars Legos, so I'll just ask why this set is $15 when the previous battle packs were $10?

Anyway, the new figures are great, I have to admit.  The updated Hoth troopers are nicely detailed with new helmets, torsos and visors.  The new helmets lack the ability to flip the visor up and down, but that is a small issue.  These new guys make their predecessors look ill-equipped for the harsh Hoth environment.  You also have a new Rebel commander, complete with authoritative mustache.  The biggest draw to me was Zev Senesca, a new Rebel pilot.  Like previous reviews have said, Zev has an updated look with more detailed jumpsuit and helmet.

The little vehicle is what you would expect, not bad but not great.  Overall, a wonderful addition to the ever expanding Hoth sub-theme Lego seems to crank out every now again.  Grab a few as this will most likely be the cheapest set this season.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Niallskie","2009-12-30T03:37:06.75Z","Patience is a virtue","  I saw a bunch of these at our local TRU, but man you would not believe how they jacked up the price to $16.99. I was really tempted to buy it then coz I want to have it on the spot, but common sense got the best of me and told myself if I wait long enough this set will eventually come out on its regular price (which I thought would be $14.99). Hold and behold, went to Target and there it was, a whole lot of then for just $10.99. Grab a bunch of then as well as the 8084 set. I could not believe that TRU would jack it that high.

  Anyways, on to the review. This set is definitely a must have to enlarge your rebel forces. There aer also a bunch of new stuff that a SW Lego collector would appreciate like Zev's face print, loved the build in visor but would have been better if the visor is attachable to the helmet itself. I also think the torso print is new, specially the hose thing that sways to the right side. Head gear for the Rebel Trooper are cool in its design, visors might not be able to come up and down but you can clip it either on the top or right in the eyes, either which way you want to go. I also like the light brown pants for the Troopers, a nice change from the usual grey crotch and white legs. Torso design is awesome too, belt addition is a great improvement. Ice Cutter vehicle is a simple but very solid build, drop it as much as you want and it still hold firm. Torret are cool as well, same goes for the flick missiles. Another simple design but quite ingenious is the gun holder on the side of the Ice Cutter driver. I could not remember if it was in the instruction but I just saw it in the picture above and realized it. One question though is what's the use of the removable box in the middle of the Ice Cutter, gun holder, compartment, I don't know? 

  Other than that everything is for you to decide if you like this set or not, but to me this is a great set specially if you get it for the right price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"arctrooper170","2009-12-30T16:09:20.937Z","Empire, Watch OUT!","""This is a pretty sweet set in terms of Battle packs. Yes I liked the old clone and droid ones and liked the old stormtrooper and rebel ones but the new versions all outmatch the old ones and this set is no exception. The Ice Cutter from Episode 5's deleted scenes was a perfect pick for this battle pack. Not huge but enough to take down some Empire Stormtroopers and Snowtroopers. I love the new Rebels with the interchangable visor helmets make the rebels more realistic. The Ice Cutter also has storage space for long distance trips which is a plus in my book. A awesome set.""",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"THX_1138","2010-01-21T16:50:17.873Z","Okay, but not great","This set is pretty good, but it is not the best battle pack.

Pros:
-New torso for the pilot.
-New torso for some of the soldiers.
-We still get one of the older torsos on one soldier.
-New helmet print for Zev Senesca.
-The helmets on the soldiers are better colors and (in some ways) a more accurate shape.
-One or two of these vehicles would fit in well with the other Hoth rebel sets.
-Despite not being all that good, the vehicle is actually a real (although obscure) SW vehicle: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Laser_ice-cutter
-Some good parts in the vehicle.

Cons:
-The vehicle is rather boring, and an Atgar 1.4 FD P-Tower (http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Atgar_1.4_FD_P-Tower) should have been put in this instead, along with maybe a tauntaun.
-The new helmets are very oversized, and look rather ridiculous. The old ones were just fine.

This set is okay. The minifigs (and maybe the parts) are the only reason to get it, and they aren't perfect.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"captain_radda_radda","2010-01-19T20:54:21.217Z","Good, but not worth $11","I'll just come right out with it, this thing is a rip-off. Seriously, $11 dollars for something as big as a computer mouse! Come on, they could have at least included a turret dish or something. Other than that, this set is decent if nothing else. The Ice Cutter is quite movie accurate(even though it was only in there for 2 seconds) and is a nice rebel vehicle. The new rebels are really well built and the new hats are a nice touch. The pilot torso is detailed, but the white vest area is somewhat faded on my figure. 

Pros:
Mini figures are great
Finally, a decent rebel ground vehicle

Cons:
Too small
Brown Legs?! In the Snow?! 
Random crate in the middle
Too small
Price

Overall
A decent battle pack that goes great with the hoth rebel base and brings the hoth battle to the ground. I recomend it, but don't expect too much out of it. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Brickman193","2010-01-11T00:28:33.95Z","""Walkers Inbound""","At long last, LEGO Star Wars delivers a Hoth Rebel that is reasonably accurate to the film. A great set, and also agruably the best BP to date - it's even worth the $23 AUD price tag.

MINIFIGS
The set builds on the BP theme of having 1 command minifig (a grumpy looking mustachioed veteran that I call ""Sarge""), two normal soldiers and a brand new Rebel pilot named Zev Senesca. All minifigs here are wonderful; the new hats are excellent, and the dour expressions on everyone's faces really give the impression that these guys are the first line of defence against the Imperial forces. The redesigned pilot, with brand new helmet and double sided torso is the star here. 5/5

SPEEDER
Apparently called an ""ice cutter"", this speeder is small, compact and a capable challenge for an Imperial speederbike. It comes with flick-fire missiles, a revolving turret, a box for holding supplies and a place to store the rifle for the pilot. Easy to build, sturdy and well designed. 5/5

Well, that's pretty much it. A set worth buying, playing and displaying. A fine purchase and a great way to celebrate 30 years of the Empire Strikes Back.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"flyguy","2010-01-16T02:57:46.28Z","Lets face it, were buying it for mini figs....","Never mind those in the USA balking at paying $16.99USD  for it, it was flippin $23.00AUD! at Target, Melbourne, Australia. ($1AUD equates to roughly the same as I write for $1USD). USA gets dirt, dirt cheap lego and even 16.99 was good!!

Managed to find this for a more reasonable $18.67 at Big W.

Minifigs are quite good, hats, goggles and the backpacks tend to jack the neck and the height of the head up which looks a bit odd. The 'Ice cutter' is a bit of a throwaway vehicle really. Not the best which is really i think reserved for its companion set 8084.

in essence 'great for minifigs and thats it'.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"parchioso","2010-01-13T09:51:40.34Z","A long overdued battle pack","This is a long overdued battle pack that the Hoth Rebel Troopers deserve, I remember that years before I need to get one single Hoth Rebel at more than 7 USD. This set provides a good chance to collect them.

And a few other nice things about this set:
(1) Individual faces for the rebels
(2) New Pilot in new design
(3) New Hoth Rebel uniform and Helmet

But the vehicle (ice cutter?) is lacking excitment, I feel that 8084 has more fun equipments than this one.

I have a pictorial review at: http://brickand.me/2010/01/13/FinallyALegoBattlePackForRebelTroopers.aspx and I am also preparing a MOC combining 8083 and 8084, which I think would synergize well",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"The_Brick_Studios_inc_","2010-01-23T20:27:59.077Z","Not as good as it could be","I bought this set yesterday and i was quite impressed with the set.
it took me about 3 mins to build and about a minute to notice that i was done so fast.

i relised that this set was horrible on its own, so off i went to by another one.
the set come's with two rebel tropper's, officer and zen senesca.
I can't find Zen senesca in the movie.......

the trooper's are preety basic, with a helmet with gogle's and back pack.
the officer's the same but with a different hat face and torso.
Zen Senesca has got the same old rebel pilot torso and legs but with a slighty different paten on his torso, as well as the helmet.

the tank is ok but it could be better, it has revolving turrent and flick missle's and a crate in the center that you can put the three smaller blaster's, you can put the sniper rifle in the stud on the left hand side of the tank

i also bought the set 8084, when you but them together and think, i'd never pay $60 dollars for just that small thing, problem is, i just did. doh

any way to have minimum fun i recomend by a LEAST two of the rebel trooper battle pack.

doing right lately are the production of these Star Wars battle packs.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Ever since the inception back in 2007 I have
waited in earnest to see what the next yearâs offerings would be and I have
seldom been disappointed.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>This set is a
little on the borderline but a good one nonetheless.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nothing to get worked up over, but these are the best yet.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The original one in the 1999 7130 Snowspeeder
is definitely vintage.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It has that lock
of hair with the old school Lego smiley face and the typical Lego helmet/visor
combo along with the rifle w/scope.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>We
had a slight redo with the 4500 Snowspeeder, more changes with the Rebel Hoth
Base, and getting closer with last yearâs Echo Base.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>These have a great look that is much more
movie realistic with their visors and headgear.<span style="""">&nbsp;
</span>The backpacks are also a nice touch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to have his commander.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Having Zev
Senesca (Rogue Two) is a welcome addition.<span style="""">&nbsp;

Pilots.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Also, props for him coming with
a pistol.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

OK since they could be from different âplatoonsâ or something.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I had a nice Hoth Battle setup on my

bad, I guess<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>When youâre done with the pickup
hockey game, you need something to smooth out the ice, right?<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>This one just happens to come heavily armed
with two flick fires and a swivel-mounted laser cannon on top.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Itâs pretty solid and isnât going to fall
apart on you either.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>One nice addition
is the 1x1 âheadlightâ brick just in front of the seat that doubles as a mount
for the driverâs gun.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I do not
understand, though, the purpose of the 2x2 box that fits in the middle of the
fuselage.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps another throwback to
the early days of SW Lego when we got the Battle Droid Zamboni in the 7141
Naboo Starfigher.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>My only other
complaint is the phony visor on Zevâs face.<span style="""">&nbsp;

instead of using the helmet.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I donât
know what else could have been done.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The

<p>I am not familiar with the vehicle though I hear it is from a deleted scene or concept.&nbsp; There are many good pieces that make the vehicle, so they can be used elsewhere if you do not want an army of these little tanks.&nbsp; I am intrigued by the little box in the middle of the vehicle.&nbsp; It has a SNOT plate under it so the box can be removed.&nbsp; There is nothing that suggests what it could be used for.</p>
<p>Overall a great battle pack with a pilot and three troopers.&nbsp; I will have to get me more of these before they are gone forever.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

People, come on, isn't a piolt supposed to drive?! Apart from that very good, good army builder, I remember the days were you was lucky to get a minifigure and a gun and 5 white bricks for Â£9.99 and it cost more back then, but Lego still excpected you to pay for it.

<p>As a whole, I've never seen or purchased a better LEGO set for &pound;9.99. This battle pack is the best so far due to the great collection of minifigures included and the Ice Cutter vehicle itself. Though fairly small, both the figures and the vehicle are rich in detail. Here are this the lowdown:</p>
<p>Pros:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ice Cutter vehicle (first model from a deleted scene)</li>
    <li>New Rebel Trooper bodies, helmets and faces (save for the officer's, which is from an Indy set)</li>
    <li>A new Rebel pilot, Zev Senesca with new helmet printing and new double sided torso</li>
    <li>Flick fire missiles that work reasonably well!</li>
    <li>Storage container, useful for the extra pieces</li>
    <li>Well designed seat that can accomodate a minifigure wearing a backpack</li>
    <li>Hole to store drivers gun</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>No real controls for the driver (or am I just being nitpicky?)</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, this set is probably going on my top ten sets list, because LEGO have pulled off a brilliant achievment by designing a vehicle from a deleted scene and capturing it perfectly. 10/10 all the way!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

<p>THE BUILD </p>
<p>Not very long about 5-10 minutes, it depends how old you are.</p>

<p>Some round parts that have lots of MOC possibility. Great idea having missle ends as guns/ice cutters. Finally lego have made a seat that you can&nbsp;seat a minifigure WITHOUT taking the back pack off!!GENIUS</p>

<p>Great with the snowtrooper battle pack or other star wars sets. The four figures add lots of playability.</p>

<p><i><b>Building Experience</b></i></p>
<p>I prefer bigger sets because when I built this one I felt it was over too quickly! I think they could have focused more on the vehicle because basically I was almost building rebels the majority of the time! I would rate the building ex. a 3.</p>
<p><b><i>Parts</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b></p>
<p>None of the parts were particularly interesting. &nbsp;You could find more interesting parts in other sets. &nbsp;Luckily the parts are easy to put together, so it's a kid-friendly set that won't make kids frustrated. &nbsp;I give parts a 3.<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span></p>
<p><b><i>Playability</i></b><b><i><br />
</i></b></p>
<p>I do not think playabilty is good at all. &nbsp;They most you can do is move the rebels' glasses, move them like any other minifig can move, move the gun turet, and if you really want to, move the vehicle across the table or whatever you're playing on. &nbsp;It's not very fragile though, so it's easy to move. &nbsp;I rate this section 3.</p>
<p><b><i>Value for Money</i></b></p>
<p>The value for money is probably the best because I did enjoy it and it's worth it's money, so I would rate this section a 4.</p>
<p><b><i>Overall rating</i></b></p>
<p>You can probably tell what I rate this set overall. &nbsp;Since the majority of the sections is 3, that's my overall rating for this set. &nbsp;Good luck piling up all the rebels on the vehicle!</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-15T12:05:47.743Z","Stand Firm Men","<p>Set #8083 Rebel Trooper Battle Pack: A great new addition to my Hoth/Empire display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rebel Trooper Battle Pack has a lot going for it, it includes a brand new headgear for the Hoth Rebels, my very first Rebel Pilot Mini-Figure Zev Senesca and the mustache sporting Hoth Rebel Commander from the trenches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Assault Vehicle, which looks kind of like a mobile miniature tank is a great looking little model, it is something I firmly believe that the Rebels could have employed during the battle of Hoth, what's more it doesn't have any sticker details. (I added a spare Rebel Shield Emblem from my Rebel Scout Speeder set to the sloped gray piece mainly because I wanted to get rid of the sticker sheet and had no use for keeping them lying around, but also because it adds a bit of detail to the model so you know who owns it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are all great, I really like that new Headgear piece and wish I could pick up a few spares through Pick-A-Brick so I can attach all those spare white visor pieces to something and have a few extra Hoth Rebel hats lying around in case I'm feeling quirky and... for example... want to have some Space Police 3 Mini-Figures wear it while joining the Rebel forces on Hoth in their battle against the Empire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I've covered those new blaster accessories enough times in other LEGO Star Wars set reviews. This being my first Rebel Pilot Mini-Figure I will however say I am extremely impressed by the torso print, the coloring and the headgear worn by them. It's just a shame that if you buy two or more of this set and the Hoth Wampa Cave you'll have an overabundance of Zev Senesca... Who the devil is Zev Senesca anyway? And why does he deserve to be in both this and the Hoth Wampa Cave set when that Snowspeeder pilot could have been... Oh I don't know... Hobbie or somebody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say get this set, get two, but I'd stop with two because too many Zev's and too many mustache sporting Hoth Rebel Commanders amongst your troops would just look a tad silly. (Unless you wanted to make up a new Hoth Rebel Commander and swap a different pink skinned head for his, I suppose then you'd have a good enough reason to pick up a few more.)</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

<p>Very Durable</p>

"wander099","2011-01-15T12:22:49.543Z","Disappointing speeder...","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is alright, nothing special.&nbsp; Compared to some of the other Star Wars boxes, it isn't one of the better ones.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are pretty standard.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>The minifigures are the best feature of this set.&nbsp; You get two Hoth Rebel Troopers, one Hoth officer, and Zev Senesca.&nbsp; The detail on all of the figures is excellent.&nbsp; The only problem I have here is that the white goggles look kind of silly when they are over the minifigs' faces, but they look great on top of the hat, so no real issue here.<br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very easy, it didn't take much time at all, and I had no problems.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>I was a bit disappointed with the speeder.&nbsp; While it is good for playability, I found it to be a little boxy and simplistic.&nbsp; I don't like the design much at all and the flick fire missiles are difficult to launch.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I picked this up for 14.99 CDN.&nbsp; Overall, I would recommend this more for younger children.&nbsp; The build is easy and it is fairly sturdy, so it will survive play and can be assembled with little, if any, help.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4
"Duckuss_Maxximus","2011-01-21T14:51:26.877Z","8083-1 Rebel Trooper battle pack - A Little On The Weak Side","<p>This set is not very impressive. Good for Hoth Rebel minifigures though. The Hoth officer and Zev are the only different ones. Which I already had Zev from the Wampa Cave (8089) so I borrowed his head for the pilot of the Imperial V-Wing (7915). The other two are twins. They all sport the new cold weather helmets. This set does go good with Echo Base (7749). The combat speeder has some ok features. Nothing really impressive though.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Hoth Officer*</li>
<li>Good minifig builder*</li>
<li>Rebel vehicle makes good addition to other Hoth sets</li>

"brickboyg","2011-02-11T07:45:34.9Z","Good Minifigure Booster!","Figures:<br><br>Hoth Rebel Trooper(X2): A good figure, with a great yellowish beige jacket torso. Torso has a pocket and a belt printed onto it. Legs are plain, but a nice colour of tan. White backpack and guns come with the figure. A great Hoth Rebel hat and a flesh face with a red slightly downturned mouth. White hand colour.<br><br>Hoth Officer: Not very impressive, but cool moustache on flesh head, and good rebel headgear.<br><br>Zev Senesca: Zev is amazing. I love his flesh head with orange visor over eyes, and his detailed Rebel pilot hat. He has an orange body with wires and controls printed on. He has orange legs with grey hips and black hands, with a gun.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>1. Mostly all good figures.<br><br>2. Rebel Machine is cool, with its flick fire missiles and twizzling guns.

"Holton","2011-10-10T12:29:46.23Z","How many Zev's does a man need...","<p>I usually prefer to buy Imperial sets but I am looking to build up a Hoth collection and so I bought this along with the Hoth Wampa Cave (8089).<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Great box with very clear images of the contents.&nbsp; However, why are there clone troopers on my Classic Star Wars set?</p><p>Nothing much to say about the instructions.&nbsp; They were very clear and had a lot of preview pages of other sets at the back which I like.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>Again, nothing too special - mostly white with some different greys.&nbsp; The white ridged 1x2 blocks and the white smooth circular pieces are interesting, however.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The real reason to buy this set!</p><p>The two rebel troopers and the Hoth officer are great.&nbsp; The print on the torso and the new helmets with goggles are great (much more movie accurate).&nbsp; I also think the goggles look quite good when placed down on the face as well.&nbsp; I do like that backpacks were included for all three of them.<br></p><p>Zev Senesca is also a great minifigure.&nbsp; He has an excellent rebel pilot torso, with detailed printing on both the front and back.&nbsp; His helmet also has some great (movie-accurate) printed detail.&nbsp; I was also impressed with the use of the clone pilot head piece to represent the classic orange goggles.&nbsp; (More on him, though, in my summary).<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>The vehicle is a very simple build and only took me about twenty minutes in total (with various pauses to play with the minifigures).&nbsp; I cannot imagine anyone except the very youngest having any trouble.&nbsp; That said, I am a fan of sticking bricks together so I personally enjoyed that twenty minutes.<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I was happy to learn the vehicle was actually from the movie (thanks to all those below who pointed that out) but it is not exactly a great representation mostly because of the flick-fire missiles.&nbsp; I appreciate, though, that they do add to the playability.&nbsp; It is actually very sturdy and I was particularly happy with the way it glides across surfaces thanks to the inclusion of those smooth, circular pieces on the bottom.</p><p>My only real problem with the vehicle was the seating arrangement.&nbsp; It is just a 2x7 block extending from the back with a seat placed on it and, frankly, looks unfinished.&nbsp; Some detailing on the bottom and/or sides would have helped make it look a lot more attractive.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4>Well, so far I have limited myself to just talking about the set as it stands individually.&nbsp; There is not much playability individually, but it really is a partner to the Snowtrooper Battle Pack (8084).&nbsp; However, the minifigures are well done and the vehicle is solid, if not particularly exciting.&nbsp; In fact, having a couple of these vehicles placed around any of the Hoth base sets (7666, 7749 or the new 7879) would definitely add to the 'atmosphere'.<br><br>That said, this is essentially an army builder and even if you only wanted to buy one of this set, many who buy this will want to buy the Hoth Wampa Cave (8089) as well.&nbsp; So I do not understand why there is a named character here.&nbsp; I am sure for many one rebel pilot looks much like another but I am not happy having two Zev Senescas sitting in my snowspeeder.&nbsp; The fact that the minifigure is movie-accurate actually makes it worse.&nbsp; They really should have included a nondescript and unnamed rebel pilot.<br><br>All in all, if having multiples of a named (bit-part) character with no variations does not bother you or you only intend to buy just this one rebel Hoth set, it is a good buy.&nbsp; In my opinion though, as a battle pack, it just does not work.<br>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4

	I got this set from my local supermarket a few years ago for the figures, and I actually got more than that from the set: a Hoth Zamboni!</p>

	Pros</h4>

		The Zamboni looks totally awesome, and even has some flick-fires.</li>

		All of the figures are pretty varies, the two troopers because of their different weapons.</li>

<p>&nbsp;Zev Senesca: this rebel pilot wears the traditional pilot helmet and the soon-to-be traditional face for pilots a stern expression with a blast shield down. He wears orange pilot fatigues and carries a blaster gun.</p>
