"mcicero7","2009-12-20T21:32:00.153Z","Dog Fighting... in Space!","Lego has done a good job of producing Star Wars fighters for clones and Jedi but absent an enemy it limits the possibilities. Other droid fighters have come paired with a Jedi ship which makes building an enemy fleet even harder.

Now we have a re-issue of set 7252 and it is a huge improvement.

The tri-wing setup is constructed from a series of hinged pieces with flat panels serving as places for stickers and adding a blue/black color scheme. The design is ingenious and simple with great looking results.

The cockpit couldn't get any simpler and as a result there is no way to position a droid pilot creating the biggest drawback, the bouncing pilot. The set is solid when built and holds up very well when being handled.

The engines are simple and with some minor additions could be greatly improved. The firing missiles are nicely done and the blasters look good.

The presence of three droids adds a little something extra.

All in all a nice upgrade from the previous version and a welcome addition to the fleet.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"captain_radda_radda","2010-01-03T17:04:15.28Z","A massive improvement","5 years after the origanal tri-fighter, lego decides to re-do one of the least favorite vehicles. I want to start off by saying that this set is BIG. Its overall size has almost doubled when compared to the origanal. It is about as long as the Republic Fighter Tank. The colors are also great with many dark blues and light grays around the ship. Unfortunately, there are quite a few stickers. I dont mind them, its just that on a set like this, putting them on wrong can be disasterous. One of the best freatures that we see is the torpedoes. These things are huge! Although the cockpit is completely open, I think its sole purpose is to add detail. For those of you who have Buzz Droids, try fitting them in the cockpit to save room and make space . The rocket droids are cool and the commander is a nice change. Clearly, the marks are hand painted, because they are uneven and somewhat messy. It okay though, at least Lego didn't completely nuke the idea of single marks. 

Pros:
Large
The minifigures
The colors
The torpedoes
The build

Cons
The paint on the commander
No use for the cockpit

Overall:
One of the best re-dos in a while. The price is fair considering its size and piece count. Its nice to see Lego slowly straying away from the clone wars and making more OT and PT sets. Either way though, I hope they keep making more Ep. 3 sets as 2010 is the 5th aniversery. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Maybe in the Clone Wars, yes, that would explain the Rocket Droids. Besides that, I know LEGO couldn't help it, but this set has a disastrously repetitive build. I did three at a time for the wing things.</p>

"NadiaA1858","2010-02-11T20:44:28.39Z","Much better than Original","I got this fighter today and it's a great fighter. It is very accurate to the movies, and the minifigs are great. I like that lego is finally coming back to painted battle droids. The commander is certainly one of the strong points of this set. The Rocket battle droids are cool too, but not as awesome.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PRO's...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall design of the vehicle. Looks great at any angle (front/side/back/top/bottom very well designed and sleek look). </li>
<li>Open/close bubble cockpit.</li>
<li>Laser cannons mounted top, left, right and centered.</li>
<li>Rear engine well designed (3 thrusters).</li>
<li>2 long Rocket, flick-fire missiles underneath.</li>
<li>3 Rocket-Battle Droids with jetpacks (binocular pieces)...1 Rocket-Droid Commander with yellow crown and yellow stripe on front of body and 2 regular Rocket Battle Droids (all come with standard issue rifles).</li>
<li>Build is nice with gives ideas for bending sections and engine designs.</li></ul>
<p><strong>CON's...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flawed cockpit. When opening the bubble halves, it pulls off the brick plate with hinge constantly. Not good for kids playability if they're taking out a battle droid pilot often.</li>
<li>Even when securing back that plate, the clutch is off so when you close the bubble, it leaves a slight space/opening.</li>
<li>No real seated area for pilot in bubble cockpit. Just sits in there loose. They should've thought this out more.</li>
<li>Centered bubble should have the 'brain' of the ship instead of putting in a Rocket Battle Droid.</li>
<li>No Buzz-Droids.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall it's a model I like because of the design. Playbility for older kids is fine, since you can secure the cockpit back no problem but for younger kids I suggest leaving the cockpit unmaned and closed so kid's won't have frustration when playing. Of note though, for the younger kid builder, they should have no problem putting this together with just some help from parents bending the sections to make the curved shape(the bracing arms). Also parents, make sure that first part of the build with the 3 pronged plate is lined up properly. Double check that first step for your kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I <strong>recommend</strong> this model for it's overall design for the AFoL and TFoL and it's an easy kit for kid's and parents to put together and play with but bear in mind the separation of the bubble cockpit when putting any pilot mini-fig.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

"Firox_5000","2010-08-27T17:42:54.47Z","A nice but average set","<p>I got this from lego shop for £24.99. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set includes three rocket battle droids. Although roughly the same as those in the Hyena droid bomber one of them has yellow print on the top of his head who I think is a droid commander.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main and only ship included in the ship is the Tri fighter itself. Comparing it to the 2005 version it is much bette. it is bigger,stronger and more broader. The set is very nice and goes well with many sets including the arc-170 and V-19 torrent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only cons are the pod where the droids sit and fly the fighter is flimsy and breaks quite easily. The sides of the fighter also sometimes have a couple of pieces breaking off which can be quite hard sometimes to repair. I also think they should have included&nbsp; at least 1&nbsp; buzz droid&nbsp; and two battle droids instead of three. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comparing it price wise to the 2005 version the original was £9.99. Keeping in mind this set is bigger and that costs have gone up since I think £24.99 is a bit steep really and although it's piece count is quite high at 268 pieces it's too small really for a £25 set. I think the set should have been priced at £20 as it is far more reasonable and tolerable with nowaday star wars prices which sets which have been released after this in the theme have had far worser value for money.</p>

I usually build sets under 500 pieces as a &quot;puzzle build&quot;, without using the instructions, but I used the instructions to build this quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Impressions</strong>: Interesting part selection but not a ton of variety.&nbsp; The set includes 15+ of the same part, the reason for which will be immediately obvious once you start building.&nbsp; I liked the dark blue color scheme - it is an attractive color which doesn&#39;t show up in many models I&#39;ve built.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience:</strong> I usually critique models with a lot of repetitive construction, but I found this to be fun due to the large curving sections and the interesting parts.&nbsp; As I built the three identical curved sections, I started to wonder how it would come together in the end.</p>

<p><strong>Finished model:</strong> It&#39;s a good looking model and I like to see sets which break away from the brick, showcasing curved shapes like this model.&nbsp; It&#39;s way more interesting than your average 250pc set with two boring wings, a cockpit and only the unique color scheme or stickers sets it apart from every other ship. &nbsp;A top-notch small set.</p>
