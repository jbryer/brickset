It only thanks his name to the stickers if still present but a nice addition for the vintage LEGOLAND set up. It certainly deserves a review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 2 bricks: building was so easy in those days, one big white plate 10 x 4 as base on which you place the other parts. After 2 times you built it&nbsp;with your eyes closed, really a piece of cake. Result however is a strong little car with a driver although he can only stand next to his vehicle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 3 bricks: one of the first cars with a minifigure, no moveable parts or a face yet but with nice red legs and hat. My compliments for the quality of the stickers LEGO used, still in reasonable shape after 35 years. Imprinted on the bricks like the headlights would have been better but that would have increased the production costs I think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 bricks: for a kid a nice car with minifigure to play with&nbsp;is always welcome, still drives well so ok for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 3 bricks: Bricklink offers an average of € 13,00 for this set which is ok for a 35 year old&nbsp;car with stickers in reasonable condition, the stickers make the value I think. Extra remark : I found a set of stickers on Bricklink priced € 30,00 for sale, which proves my point.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3
