"Lumix","2009-12-13T09:14:42.093Z","Most powerful starfighter in the galaxy!","I have made a complete, very detailed review here:
http://www.hispalug.com/foro/index.php?topic=8809.0

The review includes many photos both of the building process and the complete model, animated GIFs to show playability and also a video.

The TIE Defender is one of the most powerful starfighers in the Star Wars galaxy. It can outmanouver A-Wings or TIE Interceptors, and it is more heavily armed and resilient than the X-Wing or B-Wing. 

The building process is not very lengthy, but fully enjoyable. It has no complicated steps. First, you have to build the body of the ship, then the cockpit and finally the three sets of wings, which are identical, so be prepared to repeat some steps here. You can see many photos of the building process, the box and the instruction manual in this gallery:
http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=411894

The finished model is medium-sized, and looks very cool and menacing. The ship utilizes the new TIE color-scheme (black and grey). There are no stickers. Here's an image of the finished model:

Rear view. The ION engine is well-designed:

The set has two minifigs, a stormtrooper and a new TIE-pilot. Here's a comparison with TIE Pilot from 4479 - TIE Bomber.

You can open the cockpit to have access to the pilot minifig, as seen in this animated GIF. There are no controls or levers inside the cockpit:

The cockpit can rotate, like the 6208 - BWing's cockpit.

This set is pretty swoosheable, and resembles the TIE Defender, although the wings could be a bit bigger, and the set could be less skeletal, specially in the joints between the wings and the hull. The ship may rest horizontally on one or two of its wings; It can also rest vertically on the rear part of all wings:

Here's a comparison with the ""real"" TIE Defender, so that you can make yourself and idea of the set's accuracy:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8087/p1080546.jpg

There is one flick-missile at each wing's tip, totalizing 6 flick-missiles. They also serve as laser / ion cannons:

Here's a comparison with the 8017 - Vader's TIE:
http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Lumix/STAR-WARS/8087/p1080547.jpg

Last but not least, I've uploaded a video where you can see this set's playability:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9wr4H6071g

PROS
- Very original, cool design.
- Cockpit can rotate.
- 6 flick-missiles.
- Proper colour scheme.
- New imperial pilot minifig.
- No stickers.

CONS
- The zone where the wings link to the hull could be thicker.
- No controls or levers inside the cockpit.
- Pricey.

I recommend this set. It is a must specially if you're building your TIE armada. Not bad for one of the first Star Wars 2010 sets: Nice design, good recreation of this mighty starfighter, pretty swoosheable and including a new minifig. Full gallery here:

"MBlazier620","2009-12-22T17:18:05.357Z","The Empire Strikes Back... And Hard","One of the best sets released with the upcoming starwars sets. I bought this the day it came out and I must say I'm quite impressed. The color scheme is on the money and the design is very symmetrical, although I must say the wings support is a little shabby and needs stronger connection. All in all i give this set a 5/5 although it has its flaws, its pros make up for it. A great addition to any collection!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoclone","2010-01-04T12:15:30.45Z","OK - but a little lacking for the price","This isn’t a bad addition to the imperial fighter fleet.  I do like the new Tie pilot (his helmet is basically a black version of the larger helmet you get with the AT-AT driver in the new battle pack.).  The Defender is a fairly easy build and I like all the extra firepower included on it. I also like the friction-lock hinge used on the cockpit as opposed to one on earlier Tie Fighters. I do feel like they cheapened out on the inside of the cockpit though. Basically the pilot sits there with no seat and no controls in front of him.  He just sits there looking out the front window like he’s in his living room.   That’s going to require some fixing. Come on Lego…if you’re going to charge $50 for a 300-piece set (which is a little steep) at least don’t skimp on the little details like that.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ChrisBricks1138","2010-01-16T08:02:51.387Z","A Rebel Pilots Worst Nightmare!","I just got the new Tie Defender from legoshop.co.uk and at first, was surprised at the price. That didn't last long. This is an exceptional set, which has been begging for release as a LEGO set ever since we saw it in Battlefront: Renegade Squadron.

PROS:

Spinning wings
Six flick fire missiles that actually work!
New TIE Pilot helmet design
Inclusion of a Stormtrooper minifigure
Perfect cockpit design
Comic in back of instruction booklet

CONS:

No controls inside the cockpit
....um.....thats all!

Overall, this ship is perfect both for its play features, and as a display piece, and is a must have for a LEGO Star Wars or Expanded Universe fan, and is an awesome addition to the TIE 'Family'",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jacobiscool4","2009-12-27T14:19:37.467Z","its okay","its okay, but you really need something to go against it. if you get it, be prepared for building the same thing three times.

pros:
- 6 missles
- 2 laser cannons
- new tie pilot

cons:
- lame
- not fun to build",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"fox171171","2010-02-15T16:27:48.747Z","Not perfect, but overall a nice addition to the TIE fleet...","<p>I've been collecting LEGO since the 70's/80's (mostly classic space back then, pretty much all Star Wars now). This is my first review.</p>
<p>I loved the X-Wing and TIE Fighter games and was really looking forward to this set. Took me about an hour to build, but I was interrupted a bit. The build is a bit repetitive as you might imagine, but I built the wings concurrently rather than one after another and that made it seem less monotonous. It's a bit smaller than I expected.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Looks pretty good (though not spot on)</li>
    <li>Grey trim instead of blue</li>
    <li>Nice to get a stormtrooper in addition to the pilot. Can't have too many.</li>
    <li>Wings solidly attached.</li>
    <li>Cockpit parts in a separate bag from the wing parts (so somewhat pre-sorted)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cost me about CDN$70, a bit high for what you get</li>
    <li>Rotating cockpit. Why?</li>
    <li>Low detail (no detail) cockpit interior. Exterior blocky.</li>
    <li>Attachment points for wings could look better.</li>
    <li>Pilot's helmet is huge!</li>
</ul>
<p>While it's nice that the instruction manuals have become clearer lately, when there is only a single part in a step, that's not a step! I guess it is better being too simplified than confusing though. I can't see any reason for the cockpit to rotate, and it ends up not quite centered sometimes. (Aside from landing, I never saw a point to the rotating B-Wing cockpit either.) The flick fire missiles should be the twin ion cannons and quad lasers, but I imagine they are!</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p><span style=""font-style: italic;"">I’ll start off by giving a disclaimer:</span><span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I’ve never been a big fan of the TIE Fighter
in Lego form.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Sure, it was nice to have
the Darth Vader TIE Fighter come out as one of the first sets and then a couple
of years later to get the regular TIE Fighter.<span style="""">&nbsp;
</span>But as I think about it more, it was really because we were getting Darth
Vader in minifig form and then the Stormtrooper (finally!).<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Now that these minifigs are pretty ubiquitous
the sets they come with are kind of ‘meh.’</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">With the TIE Defender, it’s more of the same ‘meh.’</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The biggest hang-up with this set is the price.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>There’s no way in H-E-double hockey sticks
that this thing should be priced at $50—just plain ridiculous.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>“Well,” you may wonder, “maybe there’s some
specialty pieces made just for this fighter.”<span style="""">&nbsp;
</span>I can find only one unique part, and that’s the TIE Pilot helmet (more
about that in a sec.).<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The rest, for the
most part, are pretty standard, even the cockpit windshield and hatch cover are
recycled from previous sets.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The only
justification I can see is that Lego may think this will not sell very well
outside the collector/hard core SW fan market so they upped the price.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It’s not an exclusive at Toys R Us so I don’t
see the justification.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Along with the price, the huge box the set comes in is sort
of a letdown.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It makes you think that
the ship will be huge, otherwise why the large box?<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I think it’s to justify the high price.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>If you’re going to drop that much coin on a
set, you’re going to want it to be big or unique or have some awesome
features.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>A smaller box will definitely
temper the will to plunk down $50.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">If you do end up getting the set, please wait for a great
sale or clearance.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The price isn’t
justifiable.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I got it for $30 at Borders
using one of their common email coupons.<span style="""">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, $30 is more the right cost for what you get.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>(BTW, the price per piece ratio is 16.4 cents—304
pieces comes included).</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Besides the cost, the other down side is the relatively uninteresting
build.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>There are two different segments:<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>the cockpit and the fins.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The cockpit is not that big and doesn’t have
a unique feel to it.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I haven’t built my
new 8017 Vader TIE yet so I don’t know how its cockpit compares, but the 8087
is reminiscent of previous TIEs.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The most
interesting portion is the Technic parts used for the ‘engine’ or cockpit
swivel piece in the back.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>There are two
propeller-like pieces that come together with two Technic wheel pieces with
pegs that hold everything together very sturdily.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The fins have two symmetric panels in each
build that hook together to a central panel that clips on to pegs built into
the cockpit swivel assembly.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>So when you
build one, you just repeat it two more times.<span style="""">&nbsp;
</span>I knew it going into the build that it would be a little monotonous, but
it was OK.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Actually, having triplets of
most of the parts made part-hunting in the pile easy and quick.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I think I built it in less than an hour (I
like to watch TV, usually something SW-related, to give the experience some
ambiance).</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">What I really like about the set is the new TIE Pilot
helmet.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It is rather interesting—an amalgam
of the Rebel Pilot helmet combined with the face plate of the updated
Stormtrooper.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I believe it’s the black
version of the AT-AT Driver helmet in the new 8084 Snowtrooper battle pack.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Thank you Lego for the great
improvement.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I was never fond of the old
TIE Pilots as they were just black stormtroopers with a crummy paint job.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>This new one has some good detail to it,
although the chest piece is still the same one used before.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h4 class=""MsoNormal"">Other pluses and things to consider:</h4>

<ul><li>I also like the new color scheme.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The black and light blay is more visually
appealing than the older black and blue.<span style="""">&nbsp;
</span>I like that this one matches the 8017 DV TIE as well.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I am hoping that this signals that the TIE
Bomber, Interceptor, and Fighter will all be redone the same way (not at the
same price point, though).</li></ul>

<ul><li>The cockpit swivel feature is a nice touch.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>It helps the swooshability factor to go up,
although the bulkiness of the three fins pushes it down too.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Having it swivel means that it can be
displayed with it sitting on one set of fins or two.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>However, with the cockpit open it becomes top
heavy and can flip over if the hatch is not pushed back all the way so it can
catch on the fin assembly.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Not a fan of the flick fire but this comes with six, one
for each fin.</li></ul>

<ul><li>NO STICKERS.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>HUZZAH!</li></ul>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Only one other minifig comes with this one, a
stormtrooper.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I guess Lego could have
gone the way of the 7674 V-19 Torrent and included one minifig, but for the
price…you really would like to have more.<span style="""">&nbsp;
</span>What I would suggest is to have something like the 6208 B-Wing that has
a base component with it.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>That way you
could justify the higher price and could have included an Empire technician
like the ones that came with the 7264 Imperial Inspection.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Then the stormtrooper could have ‘something
to do.’</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">For modders, there are tons of wing pieces and large panels
but nothing diverse in terms of colored parts.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;"" class=""MsoNormal"">Again, my recommendation is get it for $30 but anything
higher is not worth it.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

"EtudeTheBadger","2010-03-27T18:17:17.373Z","'TIE Defender Standing By!'","<p>Finally! I've waited five long years for this fighter to be converted to LEGO, a wish all too fuelled by <span style=""font-style: italic"">Empire At War</span>: <span style=""font-style: italic"">Forces of Corruption</span>. I have been tempted to create my own Defender, but I decided to wait; LEGO would come around.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they have!</p>
<p>First off, let me say that the Defender is a superb addition to any Star Wars fan collection. The fighter looks great in a combat reenactment against any Rebel craft (including an E-wing I built), the TIE Pilot included is excellent with his swanky new headgear and there's another stormtrooper to add to your collection (or your first stormtrooper if you're new). The structure of the ship is relatively sturdy and swooshable, and the cylinder engines look cool and so individual from the 'eye' thrusters of other TIEs over the years. It's also fun to make- an invaluable part of any model, really! Add to your Imperial Fleet- or, start a Zann Consortium Fleet!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh <span style=""font-style: italic"">no</span>. Here come the pessimistic slants. As always, there are some cons, I'm afraid. Firstly, flick-fire ordnance. <span style=""font-style: italic"">Yuck</span>. These missiles are the worst gimmick ever added to a LEGO range. Seriously, they have the firing range and force of a wingless gnat. Also, even if they <span style=""font-style: italic"">did</span> work like the blue-blazing torpedos seen in the films, they're ridiculously hard to fire from the wings. Getting a handhold <span style=""font-style: italic"">ain't</span> easy. Also, the cockpit <span style=""font-style: italic"">spins</span>. <span style=""font-style: italic"">WHY?!</span> The Defender is a fixed-wing craft (or so I think) and gets its inertia from actual manoevres in space. This feature made the fighter hard to move about properly. Also, the cockpit has no instrumentation- again, <span style=""font-style: italic"">WHY?!</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Looks cool in every way</li>
    <li>TIE Pilot's helmet is fabulous- shame it's a first</li>
    <li>Another Stormtrooper</li>
    <li>Wings well built</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons: <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Missiles - ppppht</li>
    <li>Wings slant about when moved- probably because of smooth tines</li>
    <li>Cockpit spins- needless</li>
    <li>Featureless cockpit- awwww</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't worry- it's still <span style=""font-style: italic"">super!</span></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
"vid454","2010-05-05T14:03:19.903Z","A great set for your collection!","It's a great set if your a collector or you like TIE fighters.

"Phantom","2010-06-18T16:05:27.31Z","Good, but far from amazing","<p>Recently got this set on a sale for half price, which i think is the perfect price for it. I would never have gotten it if it wasnt for the decrease in price, nor do i reccomend getting it unless you can find it on a good offer because £40 is way over the top. The maximum this should be is £31.99. Apart from the price, this one is reasonobly good, there is nothing exactly wrong with it, but it should have more features. One thing is that the cockpit has NOTHING INSIDE IT, NOT EVEN 1 LEVER! You could easily put one beside the pilot, but basically, he looks stupid in there without nothing. Another thing is, what idiot though of putting a red brick with the studs facing towards to minifigures back?!? I had to remove and replace it with a normal brick of its size, in a gray colour, now it looks nowhere near as stupid.</p>
<p>one good thing about this is that it has no stickers! Woohoo, something rare of lego to do, but the printed pieces are nothing special, they are just recycled from other sets.</p>
<p>Minifigs are 1 stormtrooper, which has no definite reason to be there(but i still like it!) and a new, better looking tie pilot, he uses the same head as the at-at driver from the snowtrooper battlepack. No new body though, but the helmet looks better than the old one.</p>
<p>Now, onto the building. I started getting a headache from building all those stupid wings, and the build is VERY REPETIVE. The only non repetetive parts are the minifigures and the cockpit, which is small and only consists of a few pieces. The set however, is quite sturdy, compared to others, but the wings tend to fall off every other time you play with it, but they are easy to attach so im not gonna complain about this. The spinning feature isnt bad, it keeps the cockpit in the same place as you turn the wings, but on my one, it dosent look exactly right, because it goes slightly in the direction you are spinning the wings and then falls in line with them. This dosent detract from play though.</p>
<p>Overall, i think this set is missing quite a few important features, it looks rather stupid without them, so you would basically need a lever, and a four stud long gray brick to make it look better. it an&nbsp;ok set, but you would have to be stupid to pay £40 for it though, max ide say is £30, try looking for sales, its always on discount somewhere.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4

<p>Parts: Nothing new for me (except the Pilot)</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Not 4, or even 5, but 6! 6 flick-fire missles!</li><li>Rotating thingy in cockpit keeps pilot upright</li><li>New (at least at the time of release) TIE pilot</li><li>Stormtrooper as a ground crew</li><li>Cool thruster piece at back</li><li>Red piece with holes on front behind pilot can be used as a blaster rack</li><li>BIG!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Cockpit flips upside down when cockpit is open in the same way it stays upright when closed</li><li>Missiles don't always work</li><li>Somewhat&nbsp;repetitive build</li><li>Pilot has no blaster.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is an accurate depiction of the deadliest starfighter in the Imperial fleet, (Shields, hyperdrive, ion cannons, missiles, lasers, and more maneuverable than even a TIE Interceptor) and also a great set. &nbsp;That's all.

	I got this set from my stepdad&#39;s best friend, snd must say that it is an impressive set, albeit the evil price tag.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The new TIE series is rockin&#39; the gray instead of the old blue.</li>
	<li>
		The spinning function on this fighter is spot-on.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The resting position is not the best or the most secure ever.</li>
	<li>
		The flick fire missiles are in abundance, which is nice, but don&#39;t work at all when the ship&#39;s wings are spinning.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This set is a great addition to the Star Wars Expanded Universe line, and is great for my dream of Lego X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter. Buy it, but it is expensive for what you get.</p>

"Chills","2012-08-29T13:01:42.763Z","An interesting TIE set","<p>This set was on my wanted list for a while because I was a big fan of the PC game TIE Fighter, and I'm a collector of all things Imperial. Once I got the set I was a bit disappointed. There's really not much to it besides wings and a central cockpit.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: TIE ships are pretty simple in design, wings and a ball cockpit, and this set follows that philosophy. So I guess a pro would be that LEGO used what limited data they had on the TIE Defender and made a set that matched the one from the SW universe.<br></li><li>Pro 2: It comes with two minifigures, an updated stormtrooper and a TIE pilot with actual TIE helmet (not a repainted stormtrooper helmet). Both minifigures are cool, but not very unique.<br></li><li>Pro 3: The designers used some creative techniques to get the tri-wing design. Not the easiest with LEGOS.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The build was very repetitive. When I recently moved I disassembled almost all of my sets, but I left this one mostly intact. It wasn't a very enjoyable build, nothing made me go ""hey this is pretty cool.""<br></li><li>Con 2: There's not much to the set. Sure it is swooshable, but there's not much when it comes to playability. Its a little too simple.<br></li></ul>
<p>I got this set on eBay for a pretty good deal, otherwise I'd not be too happy for paying a premium for this set. Its a cool addition to my TIE collection, but unless you must have every TIE out there you can probably pass on this one.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
"tvih","2012-06-13T17:46:02.81Z","A quite nice representation of TIE Defender","<p>I wanted this set because the original TIE Fighter PC game was one of my favorites as a youth, and Defender was one of the flyable craft in it. Luckily, I managed to find the set for a decent price - for the most part at this point you're looking at buying second-hand and/or at inflated prices.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is nothing special. It features the same picture on three sides (front, left and right), with pics of the included mini figures on the top and front as well. At the back you get a different view of the Defender and figures, as well as a couple of images depicting its cockpit and missile functionality - as well as ""ads"" for a couple of other Star Wars sets. Oddly enough the upper portion of the back and front depicts three clone troopers, which obviously are from a different Star Wars era than the Defender. But as the new TIE Fighter box has Darth Maul in it too and so forth, I guess this is not the only box with that oddity.</p><p>The instructions are clear enough. You won't be left wondering what you are supposed to do next, especially as the build is quite straightforward.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts list doesn't feature many interesting things. Since it's a largely symmetrical craft, you get a lot of the same parts, so the variety isn't huge. This shouldn't be a problem if you're buying the set for the sake of getting this exact ship like I did, but if you're looking to use the parts for something else, then you might be disappointed - depends on what you're looking to build, of course!</p><p>Given the relatively nice size of the ship, the actual part count isn't that high either at just over 300 parts.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Included are a pilot of course, and as a very nice bonus a stormtrooper as well. He doesn't - and isn't supposed to - fit inside the ship, so he's indeed just a bonus. He's my first stormtrooper, hopefully with many more to come, though current sets don't offer many choices for getting a standard stormtrooper - you're pretty much left with the Endor Battle Pack, and even that has only one for a quite steep parts per buck ratio.</p><p>The pilot looks nice too, and is apparently a bit different from Imperial pilots in other sets, for example compared to the pilot found in both the new TIE Fighter and the TIE Interceptor &amp; Death Star sets.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It should come as no surprise that the build is a bit repetitive, since the ship is indeed quite symmetrical. So it's not the most fun or unique building experience in that sense. But that's indeed to be expected, and can't be helped given the ship's design.</p><p>It's also a straightforward build in general, so no big surprises or difficulties to be found.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Even after having seen all the images in comparison to the mini figures, I found the model to be slightly larger than I had expected. It looks quite good, and acceptably similar to the original ship. The rolling cockpit - it always stays ""upright"" - is an interesting addition.</p><p>I did wonder why the ship only has two lasers, since it's supposed to hae two lasers AND four ion cannons. It does have six missiles, while it should have only four. They're of the ""flick-fire"" variety, though in practise you'd have to ""wear down"" the parts quite a bit to actually make them ""flickable"" - as it is, I have to pull with some force to remove them from the ""launchers"". But as a display model, like it is in my case, that's of no consequence.</p><p>One very minor thing is that the wing sections - the six long portions - are ever so slightly wobbly. It's not a big deal - for a display model, it's fine as it is, and when playing with the model... parts tend to get knocked around a bit anyway, a few millimeters here or there doesn't really matter.</p><p>One last quibble is that the pilot doesn't have any controls, which seems a bit of an odd choice.</p><p>As for playability in general, other than the mentioned issue with the launchers I don't really see any problems. Many people have stated that the model is awkward to hold when playing with it. I'm not sure why. I found it perfectly natural to grab the ship around the engine fuselage, it only needs one hand and it seems to be it should work fine even for someone with smaller hands. A very small person who might not have the strength to hold it that way for very long can just support from under the ship with the other hand.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In summary it's a nice model whether you're getting it to play with or just to keep on display. It's not perfect, and especially the building process isn't that thrilling, but it's still a good addition to any Star Wars collection.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
