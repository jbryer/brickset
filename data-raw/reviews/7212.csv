"Commander_Bly","2009-12-21T20:31:30.153Z","Awesome set!","This set is so great! I really loved it from the minute I opened it after buying it at my local Super Target, and it is an awesome build and an a just totally-beastly set! Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
 - Kit Fisto, a rare minifigure
 - Two totally new minifigures, Captain Jag and the pilot
 - Three cockpits of a slighty better design
 - Awesome engines
 - Really cool green astromech droid
 - Very fun build
 - Sleek design
 - Lots of good pieces, could go along with the V-19 Torrent

Cons:
 - Price is a bit high at $60, I think it would be better at something more like $45 or $50
 - The stickers are a bit annoying
 - The side wings are difficult to keep up

It took me 2 hours to build it.

This is overall a great set I recommend you get it soon!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Jcc2224","2010-01-03T18:49:43.093Z","Great classic Episode III set!","This is a very nice set. The new helmets for Captain Jag and Clone pilot are very cool, with the open visor. The back torrent is loose and will not stay in one direction for long. The wings that fold out are a similar mechanism to the X-Wing. The long slope bricks on the side are empty, so thats nice storage for Kit Fisto's Lightsaber. The droid socket for the nice new R4-P44 is built like the old one. The fold out cockpitscan break off when not pushed then pulled. 4/5. Walmart is a good place to get it! ;) ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"superdave","2010-02-18T08:40:58.153Z","Not Bad If You Can Get It On Sale","<p>I was fortunate enough to pick this up at 15% off at Toys 'R' Us last night (I paid about US$51 plus tax). I love fun spaceships and this set has multiples of several new parts, so I decided to take the plunge.</p>
<p>The build was hefty but had some drawbacks: it's easy to build some sections (especially the wing-split mechanism) incorrectly; the 3x6 slope &quot;windows&quot; look like good handholds for swooshing but the weight of the ship could cause the single-stud connections to fail, smashing the ship to the floor; and the modular nature of the construction results in a somewhat floppy final product (connecting the wings to each other through the fuselage might be possible, allowing the wings to be firmer). There are a couple of gaps near the cockpit windshields; they could easily be filled by removing the hinges if you don't want your clone pilots to &quot;suffocate&quot; in &quot;space.&quot;</p>
<p>The parts selection is great: new 2x1 cheese slopes and 2x4 tiles were two of the big reasons I picked this up. The dark red parts, including hinge bricks and wing plates, and minifig parts added to the fun.</p>
<p>This thing is big! Wider than it is long, small hands and short arms may have trouble zooming this around the house- and again, I think it's safer to hold this by the bottom of the fuselage than it is by the top. The &quot;torpedo&quot; shooter isn't strong (flick-fire missiles launched by a technic axle assembly) but the wings open and close and the rear guns can tilt and turn.</p>
<p>Even on sale, the ARC-170 isn't cheap ($.13 per element <i>after</i> discount; themes like Space Police and Power Miners average near $.12 per element at full price). Make sure you want this set before you buy. I'm happy with the parts- lots of new bits and new minifig elements- and the build (despite the floppiness). It's not a must-have, especially if you have the previous incarnation of this ship, but it is a great-looking rendition of one of the key starships of the Battle of Coruscant.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"joelmama29","2010-01-19T01:36:49.263Z","ARC-170 Vs. ARC-170","Well where can I start! Several years ago I bought the original ARC-170 and I would have to say that was one of my favorite setts because of teh detail and the mini figs. So when I heard that Lego was rereleasing the ARC 170 I was wondering how Lego would make it better. Having to compare the new ARC to the orignial ARC that I own I would have to say if you combine the two you will have one perfect ARC 170. The original ARC has detail printed pieces and the new one has stupid stickers that you can never get them on quite straight. But the new ARC is has a better build design, and is very sturdy. I love the engines on the wings they are bigger and bolder. The front end is more like the ship in the movie and the ship is wider and heavier. Another pro is the mini figs. You get two clone pilots, new astro droid, and KIT FISTO! Kit Fisto is great if you were not able to get him in the Obi Jedi Fighter/Hyper Drive Ring set. Great job Lego on the Mini Figs not just making the same clone pilots but giving us original mini figs. This gave this set a 4 it would have got a 5 but stickers drive me crazy. Lego please go back to printed pieces I will pay more! If you have a chance though to buy this set get before people sell them for overinflated prices. Just for fun I think I am going to combine some of pieces from the original ARC to the new and make a perfect ARC-170 for my collection. 

PROS:

Mini Figs 
  Captina Jag
  Clone Pilote 
  Kit Fisto
  R4-P44

"ian","2010-02-22T16:06:02.937Z","Pure Awesomeness","The ARC fighter is fantastic lego set. Everything about it is just fantastic. But let's start off with the minifigures. Kit Fisto is included in this set, he is very well detailed and the silver lightsaber hilt is nice. The new clone pilots are the bomb! I especially like captain Jags helmet. Their torsos are very well detailed but their legs lack any printing at all. the green astromech droid is really good looking. I think he's better than R2 D2. Now onto the ship. everything is big beautiful and detailed. The ships utterly massive yet surprisingly swooshable. It's got some pretty neat features. The S foil wings, the flickfire  bombs, opening cockpit is all great. Speaking of the cockpit, they have controls score! The only thing that can match the fighters size is it's price. 75 euros! Good grief! But the fighter is worth every last penny. The droids might as well take coffins into the battlefield with them when the ARC is around.! You won't regret buying this!",FALSE,5,5,4,5,2
"namekuji","2010-02-20T04:54:18.433Z","Straight to spare parts.","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A horrid remake of the 2005 arc-170, (which is quite rare for a remake to be worse than its counterpart).</p>
<p>This model does have that horrible 'slapped together' feel as a result of it's unsealed cockpits, incomplete underside and ill designed backside. As for price, just outrageous!</p>
<p>(nice flick mech though). Those pilot helmets are cool in the pictures but because they are flat on the backside, just dont look good in real life. To add insult to injury, it is a sticker heavy model. Even the cockpit computers are stickers (or have nothing at all)!! Seriously wrong for a classy warbird like this.</p>
<p>Good for spare parts (except computers because there arent any). Give this model a miss. Get the 2005 one if you can and contrast the 2, that is a super spacecraft with nice computers, sealed cockpits and longer wings.</p>
<p>This model is lousy at best. I'll never build it again, just horrid.</p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
"Starstreak","2010-01-25T00:33:43.233Z","Great set, but watch the price tag.","I did a full review on another website, which you can view here.  Complete with pictures and even a comparison between this and the older 7259 set!
http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=37948

Here is the closing for that review.

Comments: I'll start off as I normally do and rant about the price. This unit has 396pcs and going from the old standard of .10 cents a piece, this set should cost around $39.60. At the new standard rate of .17 cents a piece, it comes out to $67.32. I paid $67. Wow, I hit it right on the nose. But it's so hard to feel like a good deal to pay so much for so little pieces. BTW, TRU had it for $86.99. Click on it. My rant is done.
Overall I LOVE this set. I like most Star Wars Lego sets. It looks like what it's supposed to be, but what I don't like is when they previously released a set and they didn't improve on it by much. It is cleaner and more up to date, but as you read in the comparison of the old set, many things was done right the first time. Maybe if I can force myself to dismantle both sets, I'll make one set with the good of both sets.

My rating
Playability: 4/5 This is playable. Made for kids. Minifigs are nice, and where else can you get a green R2 head?

Design: 3/5 Right in the middle. Design is close. But many things that was good on the old set, they didn't use on this set. Like when they used printed pieces on the 7259 or a clear window instead of a fake sticker to look like a window.

Build experience: 3/5 It's made for ages 8+. My son can build this. But the stickers are a royal pain because this set uses a lot of clear stickers, and clear stickers are harder to remove without damaging the clear area of the sticker.

Overall: 4/5 I think this would make a great set. Get it for MSRP if you can. I know a lot of places are sold out, but more will come in.

"captain_radda_radda","2010-01-19T20:43:25.593Z","In one word: Outstanding","I had some target giftcards left over from my splurging and stumbled upon this beauty at a very empty Lego isle. I got home and got to building immediately. The build was roughly and hour and the result was spectacular. In all honest, I can't think of any words to describe the perfection of this set. When compared to the last Arc, this one totally upstages it. The nose is the biggest improvement seeing as the origanal had a cracked one. Also, the missiles fire pretty well. One thing I'd like to add is the amount of space given in the gunner and co-pilot seats. There is enough room to even fit large headed characters like Ashoka. The crank system is much more refined so there is a less flimsy wing system. Kit Fisto has to be one of the best minis I've seen. Also, Jag and the pilot aren't bad either, but I kinda wish that they would have included a clone wars era pilot. Oh well, it is Ep III's 5th aniversery. 

Pros:
Price: $60 is more than fair considering the size
Minis: 4 rare figs that are currently exclusives
Sturdieness
Awesome looking

Absolutely none

I built it in two hours, without trying to rush, which seems like a decent build time - not too short or too long. The minifigs are great - the pilot helmets are a nice new (I think) design, and it's nice that they're pilots with faces rather than boring clones with black featureless barrels instead of heads. And Kit Fisto is obviously the most unique and interesting. You get a good lot of white and dark-red parts, ideal for building other spaceships with the stuff that comes in the box. As others have noted, there are lots of stickers and Lego should print the pieces, not give us stickers. But on the other hand, it looks fine without stickers, if you don't want to put them on. Overall, a very pleasing and substantial ship.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

I said that the model sounded awful, and the stickers would ruin it.<br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Is</span> it awful? <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Do</span> the stickers ruin it?<br><p>Well, let's go deep here, huh? The ARC-170 2010 is a hefty beast, make no mistake. It's got bigger engines, bigger guns, bigger cockpits... well, let's just say bigger <span style=""font-style: italic;"">everything</span>. It's a 'Super Size Me' version of the previous model. But is it better?</p><p>Yes!... and, no. <br></p><p>The build is excellent, to start. If you've built the original model back in 2005 or whenever, well, there's little new to be honest... initially! The undercarriage is the same, just uses more pieces, and there's no bomb dropping action- rather, a pair of flick fire missiles occupies the belly of the ship. Everything pretty much proceeds as normal until the nose- the nose on this one is a lot more detailed and movie realistic- even down to the Incom symbol on the sides. More chunky pieces are used, making the nose more substantial. The forward cockpit has a control panel, too! The rear cockpits are a new story, also- rather than the sides of the ship opening, it's now easy to simply put figures in due to a wider body, and the sides are fixed in place. Well... it's more solid than the 2005 one, without any pieces breaking off. The rear turret is also genius. Two guns are linked through a rear turntable mechanism, and can be angled for a precise aim. They can also be tightened, preventing any annoying swivelling when manoevring the ship- a real problem with the 2005 version, which had a very badly-designed gun in comparison. The wings are where this model has the clear advantage! Whereas the 2005 model's wings were flimsy and sometimes difficult to position correctly, the new foils are held on with double the parts, doubling the durability of the foils and also the model. The guns are also much improved- they're built with Technic axles instead of poles, and look a lot more... <span style=""font-style: italic;"">butch</span>. To top it off, the pilots look more movie realistic- they've got no faceplates, giving a good look at their faces, which I'm sure every Star Wars fan like me likes to see in a minifigure- realism! R4-P44 the astro-droid and Kit Fisto are our guest stars, and they're pretty much worth the £50 alone. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">I didn't say that</span>!</p><p>Well, it sure looks like the new ARC-170 has the old one licked, huh?</p><p>Unfortunately, no. There are cons with this model that do it down, and they're some pretty big ones. Right, I'm going to hit the biggest one- and that's the stickers!</p><p>By. The. Force! I've never seen so many of those darn labels! One thing that really spits in my blue milk is that LEGO can't even be bothered to transfer the circular symbols any more- even they have to be stuck down now! The stickers on the cockpit canopies were painful to put on, as were the side stickers. For £50, would it be too much to ask LEGO to roll on some transfers? The fact that even the cockpit HUDs were stickers just adds to what is already a so-ridiculous-it's-comical situation. The 2005 model had no stickers and looked good- if it ain't broke, don't fix it! Moving on now. THe cockpit panels are also lacking in placement. Why have only two, ever? Both ARC-170s have this problem- why not just put three panels in- for the two pilots and the gunner?! Also, there are only two pilots. Where's the third? At least the original had all three. Also, there's just not that sense of creativity that permeated the older version. Although the build was great, this one felt a little lacking in some way. It was also a lot less colourful- the original had lights and a stripe of light green here and there.<br></p><p>Moreover, the parts used here existed back in 2005- none are relative to now! Why not just make this model back in 2005?!</p><p>Okay, maybe I've digressed. The 2010 ARC-170 is, overall, a worthy build, but consider the pros and cons, comin' atcha!</p><ul><li>Pros:</li><li>Great new look</li><li>Elements of the ship are bulked up</li><li>Looks more like the movie!</li><li>R4-P44 makes this set</li><li>Pilots look fabulous</li><li>Kit Fisto... again, but he's cool</li><li>Wings and foils stay on</li><li>Better rear cockpits</li></ul><ul><li>Cons:</li><li>STICKERS!!

The factors that influence my overall opinion:<br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Building experience</span>: has a few technic parts, which aren't my favorite to put together. Slightly repetitious sometimes. No new building techniques. Overall, just average.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Parts:</span> I purchase Lego sets for the long haul. <br>- the stickers: I've played with them for nearly twenty years, and I've seen how stickers hold up. This set has more stickers than any Lego set I've ever purchased. Even the small round emblems on the wings are stickers; this is unnecessary, especially considering that that emblem has been on other sets as a printed piece. The stickers are also partially clear, and if you get ANY dust or fuzz on the sticky side, it's there and visible on your set forever. On the plus side, the stickers seem like decent quality stickers, so they're not going anywhere. But they're still stickers and they make the set feel cheap. <br>- Kit Fisto's Head: the alien minifigure's head is rubber, and in my experience rubber doesn't hold up in the long run like plastic does. In my opinion, a plastic head would have been better. <br>- Other parts: pretty traditional. Lots of big pieces.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Playability:</span> The set is big, and the mechanism for firing the bombs is not bad. Not a fan of the flick-fire missiles, but this is different. Fairly ""swooshable"" as they say. Perhaps a little flimsy.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Value for money:</span> Price per piece, this is an expensive set. However, I will say that it's big. Price per square inch of plastic isn't so bad. Fewer big pieces instead of tons of little pieces. So this set is just average here.

first thing I realized about this set was the brand new episode III clone pilot
and Captain Jag. They are so much better than the old pilots, complete with new
helmets with a gap for sight, a new head with a face with an orange visor added
above the eyes and a new body. There are three cockpits on this craft; two
situated facing the front and one facing behind, which controls the rear
turret. Fortunately there are only two clone pilots in this set so you end up
with an empty cockpit. There are also another two minifigures that come with
this set: Kit Fisto and R4-P44. Kit Fisto is not a new minifigure, he is also
seen in the 7661 Jedi Starfighter with Hypodrive Booster Ring. But R4-P44 is a
never before seen droid only available in this set, and his cockpit sits
directly between the second and third cockpits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

old ARC-170 came with a bomb dropping mechanism mounted on the bottom, which I
found quite nice, this set does not come with this but Lego has replaced bombs
with flick missiles. To be very honest with you, to begin with I thought the
bombs were quite a lot better than flimsy flick missiles. But after awhile the
flick missiles began to make a lot more sense. A Technic gear piece sticks out
the back of the ARC which if pushed into the ship the flick missiles fly out
just under the front cockpit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

older ARC-170’s engines, wings and blasters were pretty pathetic. Lets take the
engines for example: They were undersized which didn’t give the ship that bulky
look. Because of their size they also didn’t make the ship feel the way it
should (by holding it/ weight). The modern ARC-170’s engines are beast, made up
of one Clone Turbo Tank wheel per engine at the front, a few thinner pieces
around the middle so the wings could hold on, and it then smoothes out at the
back; A true Lego masterpiece. The wings on this set are much better than the
wings on it’s older brother, instead of the wings snapping and falling off they
are much more stable and are held onto the ship with more reliable pieces. I
must admit though, the wings do bend a little bit, but that’s ok because the
wings will always bend a little on a ship with this design. The blasters on the
end of each wing are also a large improvement. They stand out more, making the
ship look tank, they are also longer instead of shorter stubby pieces with blue
studs at the end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

every ARC-170 in the universe there are four smaller wings on the larger wings
(two per wing) one on the top and one on the bottom. The gear piece at the back
of the ship is also used for raising these sub wings as well as firing flick
missiles. From the cockpits they rise to roughly about 160 degrees. This look
gives the ARC-170 an outstanding visual appearance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

last but not least feature I am going to review is the rear turret. It is
controlled by whoever is in the rear cockpit. The turret’s heights are
changeable throughout an angle of 90 degrees upwards and then back down. Unlike
the old ARC this turret has two blasters, not just one, one directly in front
of the rear cockpit and the other about 4cm under the other one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I actually loved the minifigures on this set, pilots are awesome specially Kid Fisto. When I started to build the set, it looked a bit like the 2005 Arc 17. One of the best part of the set is the front of the ship. It looked better and is actually better as it is more sturdy and had an&nbsp;awesome brick construction on this set. Another one I loved is the maroon engine, its the first time I have seen this kind of brick and it looked fantastic. The wing of the Arc 17 is a bit flimsy, but you can expect that as the wing is really wide. The thing that worries me&nbsp;about the&nbsp;two small wings on each side, was the&nbsp;black piece that connects them to the main ship is not supported. True that the lego fits firmly but in time lego tends to be a bit loose, and it having no support may fall apart in time. On this set too the stickers are a hasstle, specially comparing this to the 2005 sets where the bricks are printed is really no contest. Even the side bricks that used to be a see tru window is just white brick and a sticker, not really giving this set justice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sticker I do appreciate are the ones that go to the cockpit windows, it makes it look more awesome though hard to put in if your not a sticker expert. The gear that you turn at the back side of the ship to make the wings open are kinda too near the rear end and makes it a bit hard to turn, while having the torret gun at the back swinging wildly.

However, it is also strong because the pieces overlap, giving it a pleasing look to the eye, but making it strong at the same time. There are a few stickers , but they are easy to apply. The body has a more sleek and aerodynamic look compared to the 2005 version, and this set has missiles, not bombs.<span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold""><br><br>2) The Wings.<br></span>The Central wings on either side of the body are built and attached first. This is because the wing turning mechanism is housed at the joint of the wing, as the joint uses elastic bands, this is a good place to put it, because nothing could make them ping off.<br><br>Next are the upper and lower wings, each a replica of each other, the only difference being that the top wings have the republic emblem on them. These attach to the main body, and open outwards to let the ship enter attack mode. These wings are strong, they don´t break.<br><br>This is one of the few Star Wars models you can actually pick up and even fly around without it breaking.<br><span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold""><br>Now, on to the Pros and Cons.<br></span>
<h4>Pros</h4>* Unique Minifigures.<br>* Strong Starfighter.<br>* Fires missiles.<br>* The wings open.<br>* A new element<br>
<h4>Cons</h4>* STICKERS, not many, but they are there.<br>* Sometimes the cockpit screens break off, but not often.<br>* No one to fight, solve that problem by buying 8086, Droid Tri-Fighter, or one of the new Battle Packs, 7913, and 7914.<br><br>
<p>All in all it is a brilliant set, add it to your Star Wars collection.</p>
<p>A great set for Play OR Display.</p>

This rendition is the CLONE WARS Cartoon Version, Whereas the 2005 Version is the CLONE WARS Episode III <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Revenge of the Sith</span> Saga Version. I have to say I was disappointed with this set. The stickers are incredibly unnecessary in all LEGO Sets. The older Version has STUNNING Printed pieces of pure Quality. When I compare this set to the original, even though this set does have a nice front which looks stylish and quite elegant and smooth, the 2005 Version just has something about it that makes it look so much better. Maybe it's the fact that it's the identical design from Revenge of the Sith, unlike this Cartoon Version from the CLONE WARS Animated TV Show. I also think the 2005 Versions Engines look so much better with a more detailed and accurate design. Certain design features of the 2005 Version make it looks smooth and exceedingly accurate. Unfortunately for me this set isn't better than the original and really shouldn't have been made in the first place, Yuck!<br>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1

<p>Yeah, really don't have much to say about this set. &nbsp;It's nice and big, and a lot of fun to play with. &nbsp;I had this and was debating on getting the new x-wing model, but thought this might be too similar. &nbsp;I got the x-wing and like it a little better, but together they actually look great together, giving you an idea of where the xwing came from. &nbsp;It's a unique design, with some familiar features like big engines (like a jumbo jet might have), and the wings the split like the xwing.</p><p>Overall a good set.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,3
"SanMams91","2015-02-28T04:26:41.107Z","Excellent ARC-170","<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set came with various interesting parts, many of which could be used for MOCing.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You got two clone pilots, one was Captain Jeg (I think), and a rubbery Kit Fisto. Honestly, you got this set for the ship itself, not the figures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Build was very fun and actually interesting at some points. I liked especially how LEGO had you build the nose of the fighter. Very clever. One qualm I had though was always going to be about the wings. The technic bits&nbsp;were just very&nbsp;repetitive at times, and could irritate you. Otherwise, solid build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a magnificent Starfighter model. It&#39;s got flick-fire missiles that fire once you push a stud from the back of the ship, the wings open and close beautifully, and the ship itself is extremely fun to swoosh around.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a great&nbsp;ship, but I&#39;m afraid my one big downside for this set was its price. Ridiculously high for almost 400 pieces, but considering that that&#39;s been steadily improving over the years, it&#39;s a problem of the past. If you&#39;re looking to purchase one nowadays, I&#39;m afraid paying over the retail price would be worse. If it&#39;s one of those ships you absolutely must have no matter what, then nobody&#39;s stopping you. If it isn&#39;t, however, save your cash for something&nbsp;cooler. Glad I have this set regardless.</p>

"Nuruodo","2015-10-27T13:48:07.4Z","Huge clone starfighter","<p>The ARC-170 appears in Star Wars: Episode III, in which it shows its great firepower and the skills of its pilots. I was very fascinated from it in the movie, and so I decided to bought it. The Lego version is really good, although some cons I&#39;ll tell later.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m sure it has pretty rare parts, for example rotors and&nbsp;cockpits. It is made first of all by white pieces, then by dark red ones. You&#39;ll find a lot of white triangular parts, used for the wings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures&nbsp;are unique (except Kit Fisto). In fact, you won&#39;t find these two pilots in any other set (only some Episode III starfighters got similar minifigures, but without light blue gear). Also Kit Fisto is nice, with his particular head. The astromech droid is identical to R2-D2 with different colors.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I remember that I enjoyed the build of the central body: it&#39;s like a very thick boat, at the start, while it becomes more and more full of details, finally becoming what&nbsp;you see on the box. Wings, as usual, were the worst part to build, but the presence of opening mechanism made my play with them a lot, trying it repeatedly. Also the cannons were funny to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is big, surely one with the greatest&nbsp;wingspan (I think it should be just a little bigger than Z-95 Headhunter). I still very like its appearance, because it seems very recent. I particularly like the cannons, that are quite complex: they have two weapons each, and they aren&#39;t made just by them, but they include a solid base. As I said before, the opening mechanism works very well.&nbsp;There is also a missile launcher that I didn&#39;t play, but that will surely make someone happy.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like this set. It wasn&#39;t cheap, and I knew just few time ago that the price-per-piece was very very high (I paid it 70/80&euro;), but however it appeared to me worth the cost. And as it appears, bigger and made by more pieces than it really is, it&#39;s surely worth it. I found it very enjoyable, with&nbsp;these big guns, the missiles and the opening wings; they&nbsp;make&nbsp;you feel like clone pilots when the order of opening S-foils is given.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Wings mechanism very well done</p>

<p>&ndash; Accurate&nbsp;details, especially the cannons</p>

<p>&ndash; Correct proportions and similar to original model</p>

<p>&ndash; Very rare minifigures</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Wings are pretty easy to break</p>

<p>&ndash; The price-per-piece ratio is one of the highest (especially in euros)</p>
