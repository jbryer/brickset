"Legobuilderguy","2009-12-21T10:36:31.53Z","Very Nice","Got this set last night at a local Wal-Mart. They were bringing out the 2010 sets due to having NO Lego on the shelves. This is a very nice set indeed. It appears to be an update of the last outing of the land speeder set so for those, like me, who missed it the last time, this was great. The build on this is pretty easy but there are a couple of points in the instructions which were rather vague about where something went but other than that not bad. The color scheme in this set is very nice as well. Looks rather like a beat up used speeder should. Price was a bit high, 24.99 USD so that is a bit much I think. However, what made it worth it to me was that I now have a C3PO mini fig. 

Pros: 
Looks good once built.
Young Luke.
Old Obi-Wan Kenobi.
C3PO 
Grey headed R2-D2.
Nice storm trooper.

Cons:
Price per piece is a bit steep.
No place for R2 to sit.

What it comes down to is that you get 5 mini figs and a somewhat classical set. I think this is the third or fourth outing for this set so it's not really something we haven't seen before, but it is nice that we are able to get this if we missed it before. Looking at the current line up of Star Wars sets, we are going to be seeing some more re-releases this year which is both good and bad. So far with this one it is worth it as it allowed me to not only get a nice set I didn't have before but also the one mini figure I was missing. Great buy all in all.

"CTUDarkZero","2009-12-23T03:57:46.687Z","Good Ol' Landspeeder","I was looking in the lego shelfs at a local wal-mart when I came across this lego set. Seeing that it was the only one left on the shelfs, I bought it. And I gotta say, this is a fine set, although a bit pricey. It's a pretty decent set, as you get a new version of the landspeeder, and it is the best one to date. Also, you get five great minifigs, and it really does feel like it's recreating a classical scene from Episode IV. It's a great set, real fun to build, and definetily worth having in a lego star wars collection. 

Pros:
Luke Skywalker (long hair version)
Ben Kenobi
R2-D2 (new colored head)
C-3PO (Already had one, but like the new color)
Stormtrooper
New version of speeder
Not one, but two lightsabers.

Cons:
A little bit overpriced


Aside from that one little con, this is a set your going to want to get.

All of the minifigs were new, but you could argue the C-3PO isn't.  I really loved the Luke and Obi-Wan figs, but I also liked the other ones too!  I bought this set for $25, but ended up being about $28 with taxes which was kind of a rip-off.  

Pros:

-Fun, easy build!
-Awesome minifigs!
-Very, very movie accurate!
-Colorful and spread-

PROS: 

Luke and Ben Kenobi have new face designs

Incredible Lanspeeder vehicle, a vast improvement on previous models
Removable back part to store Luke and Obi-Wan's lightsabers
R2-D2 with new head design from Battle of Endor and Tantive IV
Sentry droid is a nice addition

CONS:

Wires are a little difficult to put in

"primetime","2010-01-16T12:57:34.857Z","First set I feel REALLY ripped off with...","I would have put a review on LEGO.com but somehow I don't think they'd entertain a negative review such as this.

""Amazing"" and ""Value for money"" say the reviews on LEGO.com for this Landspeeder set. I'd have to disagree.

My wife bought me this from a local toy shop at £24.99 and I feel that this is the biggest LEGO Star Wars rip-off in a long time. The mini-figures are a must-have for collectors and maybe that is why they are included, to somehow justify this enormous price tag.

If you compare the differences with this set to the Hoth Battle Packs (8084 and 8083) then the scandalous asking price is plain to see. You get four decent mini-figures in each of those plus the extra mini vehicle for £9.99. With this set you get five fairly good mini-figures plus a slightly bigger vehicle (the Landspeeder) for another 14.98 extra.

If it had been me picking it up in the shop then I probably would have left it. Now the two Hoth Battle Packs are a different story...",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Lego_Minifig_Man","2010-01-21T17:55:42.89Z","""These aren't the droids your looking for.""-Ben Kenobi, A New Hope","I'm trying a new way of organizing my reviews. Let me know if you like this way better than the my others. Okay! 

This is a great set, and it is so  much better than the previous two landspeeder sets! (One being incuded in Mos Eisley) 

Minifigures (And Droids):
Pros- The sandtrooper's backpack-thing has two (non-shiny) lightsaber hilts (handles). The sandtroopers fabric-thing is really cool! The ""New Hope"" Luke has a new chest piece.

Cons- The sandtrooper's face is black. Luke's hair makes him look like a girl. (Luckily, I had a blonde short hair peice from a older set) R2-D2's top part is a different color than the rest of him. Ben has no cape. (I was hoping for a brown one with a hood) The sentry droid dosen't really look like it's hovering.

Landspeeder:
Pros- Looks incredible and accurate! Good colors, don't see too many of those reds around!

Cons- There's no place for Artoo to sit. The windsheild should go higher up. (They'd get a lot of sand in the face if that was in the movie) I don't like how the, uh, thruster-rocket things are different. They should have the different one on the top instead.

Trunk of landspeeder:
Pros- You can store things in there... You can fit a minifig with short legs in there (Not included).

Cons- The lightsabers can't fit in there while their blades are attached.

Other:
Pros- The lightsaber hilts (handles) are shiny-silver. The lightsaber blades are just cool alone.

Cons- The set was a bit too pricy. I would've preffered it, well, free, but I think it should have been $29.99, instead of $34.83

Conslusion:
If you have to buy only one set from A New Hope, it should be this one. Sure it has it's ups and downs, but overall it's really cool.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Duq","2010-01-25T20:13:41.297Z","Great set but overpriced","I bought this set for €29,99 in the local toy shop. I love the old Star Wars movies and this is one of the most recognisable vehicles from the first movie.

The Landspeeder has been done before. 7110 was one of the first batch of Star Wars sets back in 1999. It's still cute but looks a bit clunky now.
The second version came in 2004 in 4501, the Mos Eisley Cantina set. It's longer and wider than the first set and the main colour has gone from tan to sand red. The left hand side motor has a different colour to mimic the damage you see in the film. The Stormtrooper and the 'floating' Sentry droid tie this set to the scene where Luke and Obi Wan enter Mos Eisley. ""These are not the droids you're looking for...""

This time around the design hasn't changed as much; the front is nearly identical to the speeder from 4501. The colour has gone back to tan, the windscreen is now a curvy one (from the SpeedRacer sets) and the engines are different again. The left hand side now has a different design as well as colour.

The set comes with 5 minifigs (one of them C3PO!) and a Sentry droid. The trooper looks cool with his shoulder pad but I'm not sold on Luke with his girly hair. This is also the first Landspeeder set with flesh minifig heads.

I really like the speeder. While sand-red is probably more true to the original the colours here work really well. The curved windscreen is a big improvement and I also really like the redesigned engines. It's also great to get R2D2 and C-3PO together.
The only big problem, as has been said in other reviews, is the price. At €29,99 for 163 pieces it is well overpriced.

If you don't have a Landspeeder yet this set is a must-have. Otherwise it's one for the die-hard collectors.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"joelmama29","2010-01-22T23:44:07.873Z","THIRD TIME IS A CHARM! SO THEY SAY","Well another rererelease from Lego! This is the third Land Speeder released from lego since 1999. I am puzzled why Lego would do this again but of course it is Lego and they make us all wonder at times. The set is self is nice, some of the pros that stick is you get 5 mini figs 6 if you count the Sentry Droid. I like the older Luke version with printed legs, but this new one is great version as well. I like the R2-D2 with the grey dome. This is a great set if you are into mini figs and you want to pick up an original trilogy Luke and Obi. 

The Storm Trooper is the highlight of the set I love the how the recreated the backpack from the movie and the black shoulder pad showing the StormTroopers rank. This very similar to the Mos Eisley set. This is a great mini fig to add to the Mos Eisley set or vice versa. 

This is great set to pick up if you were not able to get any of the earlier versions of Luke's LandSpeeder. The speeder itself if very similar to the other sets, they all have a secret comparment in the back to store the lightsabers. Also the the build is similar. I do like the windshiel on this new set more movie accurate and you can fit all the droids on the set which is cool as well. I also like the third engine if you notice it is different then the other two because in the movie the landspeeder has an engine with exposed wires. 

The only real Con on this set is the price point. This is a pricey set for its size and number of pieces. Who ever reads this review please note this set is 25.00 bucks at your local Wal-Mart it is more at Toys R Us try 30-33 bucks. 

I would have given this set a 5 but again I love the Mos Eisley set because of the mounted Storm Trooper on the DewBack Lizard and you get Greedo! But again for new collectors a great set to start with. 

Pros:
- 6 Mini Figs 
- Awesome Storm Trooper 
- The newly redisgned R2-D2 

Cons 
- Price to expensive for this size of set!

The fact that Luke got enough money to buy passage off Tatooine by selling this thing is a miracle... or just a testament to how desperate Han was.<h4>Figures</h4><div>This set comes with 5 minifigures in total, though somehow the brick-built 'Sentry Droid' counts(?). The <i>true</i> minifigures we get, however, are AWESOME. <br></div><div><ul><li><b>Luke Skywalker</b> - While the hair might be a bit longer than it should be, the sandy blond color is spot-on.

If you only have the first version, I would 'trade it in'. If you have the second version&nbsp;I might just suggest waiting to 'paying it off'.

The use of one mis-matched engine (to represent the engine with the panels removed) is an inspiration.</div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>I bought this for full price because of the relative rarity - I'd only seen it the once in a retail establishment, and LEGO Shop@Home keeps pushing the backorder date further into the future.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box art for this set includes a shot of the arrival of the group in Mos Eisley, with the Sandtrooper included in the set marching towards the speeder to be told the famous line ""these are not the droids you're looking for."" The background is simply a junk pile found in the space port sitting on the desert sands.</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions are as always faultless and easy to follow.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The parts for this set are not bad at all, many of the pieces are in dark red or tan which are both desirable colours, you also get some nice engine pieces which are not particularly rare but still useful.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;for this set are all you need to recreate this scene in Lego, occasionally Lego will make a set but not put enough figures in. That is certainly not the case here. These figures could be very useful if you wished to play out many of the scenes from A New Hope, including many key characters. The details are very good on many of the figures, such as Luke's shorts and belt, and Ben's lovely Jedi robe printing on his torso. I like the&nbsp;Sandtrooper&nbsp;with his black&nbsp;shoulder cape and backpack, although I think it would have looked better with the older orange capes like the old&nbsp;Sandtrooper&nbsp;from the Mos Eisley Cantina (4501) set. The sentry droid is of little use but a decent addition to the set&nbsp;nevertheless.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very short and easy, it took me about ten minutes and had no&nbsp;really&nbsp;interesting features to it, however I do like the use of the light grey piping around the front of the model.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The look of the model is very accurate to the Landspeeder from the film, right down to the damaged engine on the left of the model. There are two seats in the cockpit of the speeder and a black steering wheel.

C3PO: A golden beauty. Magnificent

Obi-Wan Kenobi: Great cape torso. Hair is nothing special, and for me a bit disappointing.

The set was criticised for being too expensive, but it did contain some rare figures and the Landspeeder was very accurate in both shape and colour, using new colours such as sand red.<br>Does the new speeder follow the accurate design cues of the 2004 model or does it share more with it's early, 1999 iteration?<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>Box and Instructions<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br><br></span></span></span></span>The Box for this model is surprisingly large when you consider that there is only one fairly small model contained within.<br>The front box art depicts the speeder whizzing into view on a suitably sandy backdrop with an Imperial Stormtrooper signalling the driver to slow down and stop.<br>The box front also shows all the minifigures in 1:1 scale that are contained inside.&nbsp; <br>The rear of the box shows the speeder in a head on, slightly aerial view, showing the removable hatch of the speeder and the minifigures in poses that seem to imply that trouble is about to start.&nbsp; Obi-Wan and Luke rushing to engage the Stormtrooper as C-3P0 flees the scene, whilst Artoo appears to have a leisurely chat with the Imperial sentry droid.<br>Other Star Wars models are advertised on the rear of the box - the rebel and Imperial Hoth battle packs and the Freeco speeder from the Clone Wars.&nbsp; Very cold and icy kits when compared to the blistering twin suns of Tatooine where Luke's Landspeeder is found.<br><br>The instructions are printed in Lego's usual neat and presentable style.&nbsp; The booklet contains 48 pages, including front and rear covers.&nbsp; Why so many pages for such a small model?&nbsp; Almost every page of the instruction manual contains only a single stage of construction, and even then many stages only require the builder to add one or two pieces to the model.&nbsp; I'm sure the Model could be built in fewer stages and still be simple to construct.<br>The last few pages of the booklet are reserved for some Lego Club advertising and a few more models from the Star Wars line up in 2010.&nbsp; There are also two pages of listed parts that are contained in the model, as well as a number for Customer Services, should you find any parts to be missing.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Minifigures</span><br><br>In 2010 Lego redesigned the minifigure slightly, making further changes to the face.&nbsp; In an attempt to add ever more detail to the figures, to appease demanding fans, Lego added a small white dot to each eye of their minifigures.&nbsp; I can't really think why this was done, as it is not something that seems to have been asked for by the fans.&nbsp; Maybe it is to add realism - a light reflection in each eye.&nbsp; Or maybe it's to bring a typical minifigure a little closer to the cartoon style of the Clone wars figures.&nbsp; Either way, it's a detail I have yet to get used to.&nbsp; I find the white eye dots make my Luke and Ben look a little aggressive.<br>Apart from the white in the eyes, the Luke and Ben minifigures are almost the same as previous renditions.&nbsp; Almost.&nbsp; Both figures have more detail around the torso.&nbsp; Ben appears to have more folds of cloth in his Jedi robes and he now wears a belt.&nbsp; A cape and hood would have perfected the Obi-Wan minifigure for this set, and I still hope that one day we will see a cloaked and hooded Ben Kenobi in Lego form.<br>Luke also has slightly revised torso with a new design for his tunic as well as a much larger belt when compared to his 2004 speeder rendition.&nbsp; Luke's trousers are also different.&nbsp; His new trousers appear to have less detailing on them than in the past, although the detail more or less depict the same folds, creases and patterns.<br>Luke also sports new hair - the hair that most fans associate with female figures. I think this hair is quite suitable and represents the Skywalker mullet well.<br>Both figures come complete with blue lightsabers.<br><br>The two droids, C-3P0 and R2-D2 both feature in this kit. The Threepio minifigure hasn't changed much in recent years, being a deep gold colour with front and back torso printing and a nicely moulded head.<br>Artoo uses the new head head piece that was introduced in 2008.&nbsp; His head is grey with full printing and is very accurate when compared to the pre 2008 rendition.&nbsp; If there is one thing the Artoo figure needs, it's back printing.&nbsp; If his dome can be printed all round, 360 degrees, why can't his body?<br><br>This kit contains only a single Imperial Stormtrooper.&nbsp; Considering the cost of the set and the piece count, another Stormtrooper doesn't seem too much to ask for.&nbsp; But there is only one.&nbsp; What makes this one special when compared to nearly every other Stormtrooper, is his black shoulder pauldron.&nbsp; It's made from the same material as the capes found on many other minifigures and it's just enough to make this Stormtrooper recognisable as Tatooine trooper on desert detail.&nbsp; He looks even more the part when placed alongside the trooper from set 4501.&nbsp; It's little touches like this that make collecting Star Wars Lego fun and interesting, as parts from one set can go towards making another look more complete as part of a scene from the movies they are based on.<br><br>The other figure in this kit is not really a figure at all.&nbsp; It's a collection of elements, assembled to form a sentry droid.&nbsp; Using some clear cylinder parts and some white cheese slopes, a small antenna and translucent red stud, the sentry droid is a small but neat construction and is the perfect companion for the Stormtrooper in this set.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Landspeeder</span><br><br>The main part of this set is, of course, the speeder.&nbsp; In answer to my earlier question concerning this speeders design aspects, the answer is clearly a mix of both speeder designs are incorporated into this model.&nbsp; The speeder retains the shape of the 2004 model, but almost reverts back to the colour scheme from 1999.&nbsp; The reason for the change of colour is simple.&nbsp; Lego stopped producing sand red.&nbsp; A crying shame in my opinion, as it was such an underused but authentic colour which added to the realism of many models and showed that Lego had an eye for fine detail.<br>Despite the abundance of tan on this speeder, the colour works.&nbsp; It works now as it did in 1999.&nbsp; It's obviously a colour that suits a speeder quite nicely, especially when placed alongside more accurate colours such as dark red and grey.<br>The build of the speeder closely resembles that of the model from 2004, with internal structure similarities, as well as the use of flexible plastic pipe for the detail towards the front of the craft.&nbsp; Topside (hood) detail seems more 'involved', as if to say that there is something mechanical beneath the outer plating, but without comparison, the minimal surface detail means nothing.&nbsp; It's really just detail for detail's sake.<br>Moving further back and you'll find one of the most interesting pieces - the curved windscreen.&nbsp; This is much more authentic when compared to the 30 year old wedge design used on earlier models.&nbsp; <br>The cockpit is placed quite far back on this model and contains seats for both passengers.&nbsp; The drivers side also has a steering wheel.&nbsp; With the cockpit so far back when compared to 2004's model, the nose becomes longer, whilst the rear end shrinks in length by a couple of studs.<br>The rear end of the model has probably had the biggest redesign when compared to the earlier models.&nbsp; New parts are used for the engines which make them bigger and look more powerful.&nbsp; Finally the speeder has turbine engines that look like turbines!&nbsp; The damaged engine is still shown, using a smaller piece than the other two engines, with two discs attached to the front.&nbsp; Showing damage at this scale with Lego elements isn't easy, but it's nice that Lego still represent damage where possible.&nbsp; It can only add to the realism of a model.<br>The top engine is held in place with a Technic pin and sits on top of the rear storage compartment.&nbsp; The storage compartment lid isn't hinged, but simply pulls away revealing a space big enough to hold Luke and Ben's Lightsabers.<br>Either side of the centre engine is enough space to securely seat both Artoo and Threepio.<br>The speeder glides on seven 2x2 inverted discs.&nbsp; SEVEN<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">!</span>&nbsp; I guess Lego had to figure a way to increase the piece count and justify the silly price tag.&nbsp; The previous model managed with three discs, and I would say that four would be more than enough in any case.&nbsp; But seven?&nbsp; Once again, an extra minifigure would have cushioned the blow a bit better than unnecessary parts added to the underside of the speeder.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Final Thoughts</span><br><br>I like it.&nbsp; It's grown on me.&nbsp; I like that the original design has been kept and how it's been mostly improved upon with some new parts.&nbsp; I think it's a shame that the sand red colour could not be used as I think that would be the icing on the cake for this rendition.&nbsp; The tan suits it, but it's not movie accurate.<br>I'm not sure I'll ever get used to the new faces for Lego minifigures.&nbsp; Face detail is normally a good thing, but the big eyes with the white highlight still looks a little odd to me.&nbsp; Going from yellow to flesh tones was a major change, and an improvement.&nbsp; I'm not sure why the eye change is necessary.<br>Like a lot of Star Wars Lego sets these days, the price to parts ratio is very poor and this model is over priced.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this down to the world economy at the moment or if it's due to rising costs of licensing, if that has risen at all in recent years.&nbsp; And to think, many people, including myself, once thought that the 2004 speeder, with it's cantina, it's Dewback, and&nbsp; it's assortment of great minifigures, was expensive.&nbsp; I'm sure we would all wish for those days again.&nbsp; Things really weren't so bad, were they?<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></span></span></span>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3

I can be forgiven this time however, as I've recently rekindled my love for the original films and wanted a product to satisfy some cravings before the Blu-rays are released!&nbsp;<br><br>With an RRP of £25, this is without a doubt one of the worser value Star Wars sets. With only 163 bricks and a model that measures little more than 17x8cm, you can do yourself a favour and get this product from Amazon as they have severely undercut most other retailers. My only guess for the high RRP is because of the inclusion of 5 minifigures that, arguably, add up to one of the main reasons you'd by this set. Its widely known that minifigures bump up the prices of sets these days (hence why the City products include so few), but because this product is based on a scene of the film which includes all the relevant characters, it was a great choice on LEGO's part to include them all.&nbsp;An better price I believe would be £16, maximum.<br><br>The product is a vast improvement over the 1999 counterpart. Detail is fantastic throughout and the build was highly enjoyable because of this. I love the use of tubes in the front and how they were placed into the base, while the back section of the model - with the large engine in the centre - also reveals some storage space. The space is fairly small and sadly doesn't allow the lightsabers to fit in... So unless you want Luke and Obi Wan decapitating each other by accident, keep those 'sabers in-between the seating area!&nbsp;<br><br>On the bottom of the Landspeeder you have a variety of concave flat-pieces that allows the product to 'glide' over carpets or smooth surfaces. This is a very nice touch that gives a realistic and fun attribute to how the vehicle should move.&nbsp;<br><br>The mini-build is a tiny black and white droid that, if i'm correct, whizzed around in the air during the film, and it has a transparent stand to sit on which gives it a somewhat good illusion of floating in the air. Personally I don't think its the best addition since its not blindingly obvious what the build actually is, but its very small so no harm being included either.&nbsp;<br><br>Our Stormtrooper has some great detailing with an over-the-shoulder cape that represents his ranking, a blaster gun and a contraption for his backpack. It never ceases to amaze me how much detail can be put into those helmets!&nbsp;<br><br>I gladly recommend the product based purely on its authenticity and relevance to the original film itself. Its a well built, solid product that will please older fans for its detail and younger fans for its easy 'grasp' and lack of parts that are likely to fall off. As mentioned earlier, the only drawback is a lack of dedicated space for the lightsabers, so just improvise and use the cockpit/seating area.</span>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,2

I will rather go with images in my&nbsp;memory-bank from watching Episode 4 instead. I remember when I sort of did an impulse buy with this set, remembering how big I thought the box was. That might be a warning sign for most future sets to come?&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I reckon, for the price point it would be a lot of going on with this set.

In a sense it really IS grand and cool but I feel it could do better with a couple of things.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Landspeeder.</h4><div>I like the colours with this one and it looks kind of similar to the ""real deal"" from EP4, although not quiiiiiite. The build was good and it has plenty of space for a driver and a co-pilot in the front. No real room to put <i>the droids the stormtroopers ""weren't"" looking for</i>, which is a bit of a downer, to be honest. Instead you can open the back to store lightsabers. Good thinking, though. The final result of the speeder - you have a very streamlined veichle. It looks quite small when it all comes down to it. There are no real features with the speeder - so maybe for some kind of sentimental value, it's worth getting (for AFOL people). Youngsters might want to have some more playability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Not too sure what would become of this set if it had fewer minifigures. It's not as exciting as the Freeco Speeder or the Sith Nightspeeder.

If you decide to do that, it's perfectly ok. Others we get are: Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C3PO, R2D2 and a Stormtrooper. They are all great in their own way although, another R2....? It seems like this little astromech can find his way in at least one set a year. I like the Stormtrooper's outfit and small shoulder patch, looks nice. What this set would have needed is yet another Stormtrooper. When you think about the scene in EP4, there are more than one trooper (think it was 5) stopping Luke to check about the droids.

The pieces in the sides of the body add a really nice touch, and though it's very hard to get them in without catapulting the bracket pieces across the room, the long pieces you bend around the front are really great for the overall look. The engines at the back and the way they're attached is good, although I'm not sure why you get the corner pieces instead of 2x2 bricks and nothing to fill the hole. And the compartment for storing the lightsabers may not be movie accurate, but it's a very useful detail. One other niggle in terms of the build: I think adding the round 2x2 plates on the underside could have come earlier, as it does tend to fall apart quite easily as you're building it without them. And until you add a set of round 2x2 tiles to them it will look too close to the floor to really be hovering.</p><p>As good as the landspeeder is, it's the <b>figures </b>you get with it that are the real reason for the set!

The 3PO in Droid Escape (9490) is better for the printed eyes and coloured circuits, but I think the overall feel is better with this one. The <b>Sandtrooper</b> is not at all up to the challenge of 9490's weathered version, but until they came out I was more than happy with him! I only wished his shoulder pad wasn't plain black.

I highly recommend that if you can find it cheap that you take advantage of it, it is well worth the price I paid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that said, there is nothing amazing about this set, no revolutionary building techniques, no moving parts, and aside from the engines, no special must have bricks. Of course the real value of this set was in the minifigures&nbsp;which I didn&rsquo;t get, but I already have all of them except for the little droid which I parted together on Bricklink for a few cents. But what makes this set great is that it gives you the vehicle that started the whole Star Wars saga. And while the landspeeder&nbsp;may not have lasted for all that long in the movies, this small little set is appropriately sized and priced for an iconic vehicle like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the design, this Lego set is instantly recognizable as Luke&rsquo;s landspeeder. While it may not be as sleek as the vehicle in the movies, Lego did a great job designing it with the 90 degree angles that they have to work with. Plus the use of two rigid hoses to represent the grill looks brilliant. The only shortfall of this set is that while it has seats for Luke and Obiwan, it lacks seats for the droids. Both of them can kind of just be placed on the back, but they don&rsquo;t have actual seats. Of course I don&rsquo;t blame Lego, it would be very difficult to fit in R2 given how wide his minifigure is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is a great set for playing with. The top engine can be removed so you can access a trunk, but that is the only &ldquo;play feature&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s just a great set to drive/fly around. Perfect for little kids, and they can build it easily as well.&nbsp;</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-10-06T19:14:19.18Z","An unbeaten classic","<p>Lego has made a considerable amount of Luke&#39;s Landspeeders in the past, 6 of which have been (debatably) minifigure scale.&nbsp;21 years have passed since the original model, meaning that we get 1 every 3.5 years on average which is probably a bit over the top.&nbsp;Today, I am looking at 8092 Luke&#39;s Landspeeder, which was released in 2010. I have some fond memories of it when I received it for my birthday around 2013, and might be the only set you could say I have &#39;nostalgia&#39; for, seeing as I wasn&#39;t around for the Classic themes like Space, Castle and Pirates.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>The set includes 163 pieces, making it the second largest of the 4 standalone speeders. Despite this, the pieces are all pretty common, with the rarest piece being the Sandtrooper&#39;s pauldron, which isn&#39;t even plastic. Nothing to see here... move along, move along...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>5 or 6 minifigures are included in this set, depending on your opinion about what classes as one.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obi-Wan Kenobi: exclusive to this set, Obi-Wan has his classic&nbsp;smooth grey hair that is found in Obi-Wan&#39;s hut and a lot of the newish sets. He features an appropriate head piece printed with wrinkles and facial hair seen in the movies. Having to adapt to Tatooine, Kenobi wears sand robes with a brown top underneath to keep the Jedi tradition. Plain sand legs are provided.</p>

<p>Luke Skywalker: exclusive to this set, Luke has long blonde hair in accordance with A New Hope. The facial expression is a pretty plain smile. Luke works on his Uncle Owen Lars&#39; moisture farm, extracting water vapour from the air. He wears simple white robes with a brown utility belt. Luke also has leg printing, which is pretty good for 2010, that finishes off his white robes and ends in tan trousers\pants.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>R2-D2: a pretty standard variant with blue printing on the grey dome and tools printed on the front of the body.</p>

<p>C3-P0: also a pretty standard variant with mediocre printing on the torso and a pearl gold colour.</p>

<p>Imperial Sandtrooper: exclusive to this set. Sandtroopers can be found on planets with sandy or extreme terrain. In this instance, he is one of the security troopers posted in Mos Eisley to find the two stowaway droids who are carrying the Death Star plans. He matches the on-screen character perfectly with a survival pack, making good use of two light grey lightsaber hilts. He has a black pauldron to signify his rank and division. The helmet is perfect, with blue grills on the side and nice shadowing. The head underneath is black and the torso has the&nbsp;standard Stormtrooper utility belt&nbsp;printing and plain white legs.</p>

<p>Sentry Droid: exclusive to this set and&nbsp;is a perfect addition to the set. Comprised of 8 basic pieces, it is made to look like it is floating&nbsp;as shown in the Star Wars universe.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Build</strong></h3>

<p>The build is pretty simple and not very repetitive. It took me exactly 14 minutes and 29 seconds to build casually, including rummaging around for a couple of missing tiles.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Completed Model</strong></h3>

<p>The speeder looks excellent in tan/sand with maroon tile highlights, despite appearing in sand red on-screen. I love how the engines are mismatched and there are some grills dotted around to give it that well-worn feel. Luke and Obi-Wan can sit snugly in the speeder, whilst Threepio chills out at the back near the engine like in the film. You can remove the panel attached to the dorsal engine to reveal a small space to hide lightsabers, blasters or illegal contraband (this being Mos Eisley and all). There isn&#39;t much play value besides the storage, but the side engines can be removed pretty easily if a crash or shoot-out occurred. The grill at the front is represented by two long tubes curled around the front and kept in place by three ledges, which looks really good aesthetically but can cause some difficulty in putting it back in place if dropped or damaged.</p>

<h3><b>Overall Opinion</b></h3>

<p>I think that the colour scheme, despite a little inaccurate, works extremely well in this set and the 4 unique minifigures only compliment that more. For a &pound;25 or $25 set, it is a little overpriced in the respect of the piece count, but some of that cost will definitely be because of the exclusive minifigures. If you manage to find it for around retail price now, I definitely suggest that you pick it up because it can only improve your LEGO Star Wars collection and, you never know, might put your other Luke&#39;s Landspeeders to shame.</p>
