"zeeverse","2010-01-21T20:48:32.513Z","A good little bang for the buck","I recently have returned to Lego after 25 years in the 'dark ages.' And this was my first pick, mostly because of price, but also because I have always liked the 'mini' Lego Technic Series. Assembly was straightforward for the A model and I felt the unit performed very well and used pretty much all save for 3, or 4 pins and such. I enjoyed it so much that I left it in the A model configuration and picked up a second one the next day to build the B model. 

The B model is neat and it left considerably more parts on the table when compared to the A model. There were some things I wanted to change with the B model so I went out an bought a 3rd kit to 'play' with. To make a long story short, I've bought five of these kits and have had at least 12 builds other than the standard A and B kit. 

And then I realized . . . I was hooked on Lego again. 

I'd give the kit 5 stars were it not for the wheels. I don't like the hubs going clear out when the construction side of the wheel is used. I like the flush-finished cross hubs of the Technic 8290 kit much better. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Legolijntje","2010-10-21T09:15:25.817Z","Not a very technic set, but it's a mini.","I recieved this set a few days ago. I built in around 10 minutes. It's not a very technical set, but i'ts a mini set. It does not much; only the arm can go up/down, but what it does, does it well. It goes very smoothly. Furthermore, there is not much more to tell about&nbsp;I think.",FALSE,4,3,3,4,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-16T10:14:41.31Z","LEGO Technic - Mini Telehandler Review","This is a fun little set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build of the main model and the second model (which is a chopper with a sidecar) are very easy to build and we also don't have to worry about stickers. This set may doesn't have any play features but it's still fun to maneuver this vehicle. On the back of this vehicle you can see a gear which moves the fork up and down. This makes it possible to move the palette up and down. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Plastic_Nurak_80","2011-03-26T06:39:49.953Z","Despite its limits, I like it","There's no more to say about this set. If I were a kid from 7 to 10 y.o., I'd like this set too much - it's cool from a kid perspective and it teaches to young builder both some basic building technique to create then their own little MOCs and some basic mechanism to reproduce working functions. As a AFoL, instead, I see the limits of this little set, but, maybe because I'm still a bit a kid in the deep side of my heart, I like this model.<br>For 9â‚¬90, however, it's good as a little gift for your boy or nephew. VOTE: 3/5<br>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
