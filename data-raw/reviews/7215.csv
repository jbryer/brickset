But there are also worse sets.<br>Actually, this is a pretty average set, but not a bad one by any means. It has a medium amount of pieces, it's not a very challenging build, but the model itself definitely has the looks. By turning a knob on the side you can make both the main rotor blade as well as the one on the tail spin. Another knob lets you operate a rope with a hook. Also the B-model is wonderful. In some respects actually it is better than the A.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Looks great after it's built</li><li>Spinning rotors</li><li>Nice B-model(seaplane)</li><li>Big</li></ul>Cons:<br><ul><li>Pretty average build</li></ul><br>If you have the chance to get it, do so, you shouldn't regret it, and even if you do, you don't loose too much money.<br><ul><li><br></li></ul><ul><li>&nbsp;<br></li></ul>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"Bob_Clear","2015-06-25T21:59:53.15Z","Nice helicopter","<p>This set is relatively simple and its main model is a helicopter. For its small piece count, you get a decently sized heli. The alternate model is a seaplane. It&#39;s smaller than the chopper, but still quite substantial.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box and instructions are standard Technic material. There&#39;s nothing really interesting here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is a good parts pack as it has several straight pieces and a pretty good amount of connectors. In addition, the wings and the panels can be used for a diverse range of MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite simple; there are no odd angles/positioning and the since the model itself is uncluttered, you don&#39;t have to follow the instructions with one eye so fastidiously.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What you get in the end is a clean-looking but exciting helicopter which has working rotors spun by turning a knob, and a winch (which functions the same way). It works smoothly, except for the fact that your fingers get sore turning such a small knob [you can attach a crank to make this easier and more consistent].</p>

<p>The alternate model, a seaplane, uses less pieces, but also has a nice appearance. The red and white are not exactly adrenaline-pumping, but they&#39;re not necessarily boring either. The propeller in the seaplane is turned by a directly connected knob in the cockpit (strange and uncomfortable location, but it works).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For $20, this set was more than worth it. The build is simple and efficient, and you get a great working model that&#39;s interesting to look at and play around with. The color scheme could have been made a bit more exciting, though.</p>

<p>In the end - recommended.</p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-04T10:46:13.25Z","LEGO Technic - Helicopter Review","I got this set last weekend. It's my first LEGO Technic set I got since 2009. We get two different models in this model: a helicopter and a plane. You can't build both versions at the same time. Both models are fun to build and to play with. They're very sturdy as well. This set also doesn't come with stickers which you have to worry about.<br><br>The helicopter is my favourite model of those two vehicles. I like the way how you can turn the gear on the one side which makes the huge propeller on the top and the small propeller on the back moving full 360°. There're two blue seats on the front which you can sviwel and there's also a cable with a hook which you can lift up and down. The plane is a good model, too but it's smaller than the helicopter. On the plane we also get a gear which can make the propeller moving full 360°. It's a cool set to have - even if it doesn't have lot's of play features.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
