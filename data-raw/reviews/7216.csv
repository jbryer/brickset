"loganevanlegos","2010-01-13T16:43:25.123Z","Nice medium level build  ","A nice little TECHNIC set with lots of gears.  You get: little tracks, lots of gears, turn table!!, good amount of pieces, cool shovel and compact design.  This is my first TECHNIC set but it won’t be my last. 

More pros:

Medium level build

Nice B model

Cons 
The gears you turn on the back 
too make the shovel arm dig is a little stiff.

"arezey","2010-01-20T16:29:04.403Z","Funny model, great(!) inventory","I caught this little thing off last Friday for 25 euros.. the model is a little weird but that may be that I'm more used to see excavators like 8294-1. But the model is quite handsome anyhow. At least I think it is.

The model has a couple of glitches, though.. the arm does not really go down much below the excavator level itself, and it's a tad difficult to control as two of the three articulation levels are combined into one. It's a little tricky, but not terrible.

I'm however one who typically buys sets for parts and thus models don't stay in one piece for long. And this was my first 2010 Technic set for a reason. Considering you get in addition to the beam and axle bulk (which is not bad itself!), you get:
- 56 old-style track links
- a rather large number of gears, including one of the brand-new pinhole bevel gear
- a bucket
- flex-system hose, which is quite a rarity these days (at least I haven't bumped into much of them)
- two of the new small panels
- a new style turntable
in a 25-euro set. I'd call it a positive ripoff. Especially the turntable which appears for the first time in a set this low in price.

Summarizing: for a model it's one among others, but the inventory is extraordinarily great. One who buys sets for parts should definitely get this one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Lexhoya","2011-11-04T06:02:45.427Z","Nice for both old and young...","<p>This set is nice-to-have-set. I bought it to keep it on my desk in the office and play around with it, but as soon as my oldest son spotted it, he had to excavate coffee-beans with it. the two functions of the lifting and scooping are really nice and work well together.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Small set, so easy to store somewhere<br></li><li>Some nice parts to use in your own models (turntable, tracks, liftarms, scoop)<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Sometimes the load in the scoop falls out, since you can't influence the turn of the scoop yourself; it is handled by the handles and beams.<br></li><li>Sometimes the knobs at the back come off, but if that's the only con...</li></ul>
<p>I also made the B-model, but to be honest that is not a nice set to play with; the main model has more options to actually pick stuff up. For the 25 euro or something that I paid for it, you get nice parts and a nice model, that also is playable by 3-year olds ;) (given they don't throw it on the ground or so).<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"zeeverse","2010-01-21T20:59:19.483Z","A Solid Performer","This is my second kit since returning to Lego after 25+ years of life in the 'dark ages.' I built the A model. I haven't build the B configuration, yet. Instead of building the B model, I went out and bought a second kit to do that, because I thinnk the A model works so well that I don't want to take it apart. 

I'm amazed at the function and articulation that one gets when building this kit in the A configuration. Having bought the second kit, I'm planning to build the B model soon, and I probably will purchase at least a third kit as I already have an idea on another build . . . or four!

I only have one little nitpick, and it is a small one. I would have liked to have seen an actual mini dozer blade instead of the brick used to 'simulate' one. Had Lego done that, I this kit would have been a kit for the record books in the A model.

Now, that I'm writing this review, I think I'm going to go get that 3rd kit and probably a 4th kit now.

I think the 8047 is a pretty good buy. And that turntable gives me a lot of ideas.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Bram","2011-01-06T09:51:42.297Z","Simplicity = FUN","<p>Even though I own the ultimate Technic excavator (8043), the 8047 still remains my favorite set. On some sets without PF, turing those&nbsp;knobs to operate the LAs is a chore (8265, 8294). But since the 8047 was designed without PF or LAs&nbsp;in mind,&nbsp;knob turning has never been more fun!&nbsp;Few turns of the knobs will see the boom and dipper arm move swiftly. The 8047 defies&nbsp;FUN in a non PF or pneumatic model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mods possibility:</p>
<p>The new 8069 has new 'mini' LAs. It might be small enough to utilize in the 8047 so you can have that&nbsp;realistic 'hydraulic actuators' look of LAs&nbsp;or pneumatic actuators.</p>

<p>Highly recommended.</p>

"Salmo_Cilliers","2011-05-03T12:06:52.81Z","A nice set.","I&nbsp;like this set because it is easy to build and it looks good. 8047 can do enough things for a small excavator! 8047 can play good enough, much better than 8046. 8047 is a good excavator!8047 is not the best lego technic excavator,but that is one of the best excavators.",FALSE,5,5,5,4,5
"SenatorBlutarsky","2013-01-05T00:53:03.44Z","Best of the small Technic excavators","<p>There have been numerous Technic excavators produced in recent history -- 8419, 8294, 8069, 8043, and this year we'll also have the 42006 claw excavator.&nbsp; At only 252 parts, this set is the smallest of the bunch, but it still delivers a lot of enjoyment.</p><p>I built both the A and B models (I actually built the B model first, at the insistence of my son).&nbsp; The A model is a compact excavator, similar to what a landscaper might use, while the B model is a large-scale excavator with a claw attachment.&nbsp; Each model took about an hout to build, but I would say that the A model is definitely the more interesting build of the two, since the mechanisms are slightly more complicated in the A model.</p><p>Both models have similar functionality and features:</p><ul><li>The superstructure can be manually rotated. <li>The main boom can be raised/lowered via a gear-knob at the rear of the superstructure. <li>The dipper arm can be extended via another gear-knob.&nbsp; In the case of the A model, this knob is also located at the rear of the superstructure, while in the B model it is located at the base of the main boom.&nbsp; In the case of the A model, the bucket curl is also controlled by this knob -- the dipper arm and bucket move together, as they do in other Technic excavators, such as set 8419, 8069, and 8294.</li><li>In the B model, the claw is opened and closed by turning an axle connector that is directly connected to the claw itself.</li></ul><p>While the A and B models have similar functions, the A model functions work much better and have a more ""Technic"" feel to them, since the control knobs&nbsp;are located farther away from the parts they activate.  The A model looks much better, too -- the B model really looks like it has been cobbled together (I sometime wish that TLC would include a few extra parts in some of the Technic sets, so that the B model could be improved somewhat, even if it meant a slightly higher price tag).</p><p>The playability of the A model is very good, at least for its size.&nbsp; The boom, dipper arm, and bucket functions work smoothly.&nbsp; The only (minor) issues that I had with it are that&nbsp;the dipper arm can't&nbsp;quite&nbsp;extend&nbsp;all the way out, and that there is some backlash in&nbsp;the dipper&nbsp;control mechanism (this backlash is almost unavoidable due the meshing of an 8T gear with a worm gear, which always introduces a littlle bit of ""slop"").&nbsp; The playability of the B model is also reasonably good, but the mechanisms are a little more jerky and less interesting than in the A model.</p><p>Other than the 56 tread links, there aren't too many interesting parts in this set , although I will note that in a set of just over 250 parts, you get 15 gears, including a crown gear, a worm gear,&nbsp;and a cone wheel (part 4558690 -- handy for use with linear actuators or transferring power at an articulated joint).&nbsp;&nbsp;At its original&nbsp;price of&nbsp;$25, it is a&nbsp;very good value.&nbsp; I managed to get it new for around $35, and I would still consider it a good value at that price.</p><p>Probably the best comparison for this set is the 8419 excavator (if you are interested, you can check out my review of that set as well).&nbsp; I would say that the 8047 excavator is the better of the two in almost every respect.&nbsp; The 8047 excavator looks better, has mechanisms that work better, and has a better parts inventory (it has tread links as opposed to the rubber tread bands used in set 8419). </p><p>Overall, I would have to recommend this set very highly.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;an interesting&nbsp;build, looks great, is a lot of fun to play with, and has a pretty good parts inventory for its size -- 5/5 bricks.</p><p></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

<h4>Parts</h4><p>The tracks and the bucket from the digger looked interesting and sealed the deal.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Get serious, it's a Techninc :)</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Looked like childs play, but tooked some time to put it togheder, I was in the holiday vacation at the sea and exausted from a day of swimming and ""roasting in the sun"", so the build looked like putting a Mindstorms and not a simple Technic set.</p>
