"Bapao","2009-12-28T03:09:54.763Z","An okay set...","Got this for christmas. This wouldn't have been a set that I would personally have spent money for, but I like it all the same.

It was a simple build. There weren't any ""look carefully"" moments here, all straight forward Technics stuff. No particular parts to highlight either. Build time was about 45mins, and I did rather enjoy it.

Pros:
- 4 cilinder engine is nice for the parts bin
- 3 suspension springs
- Roof opens. Doesn't lock into place though meaning that if you turn the vehicle upside down, the roof flaps open.
- Steering works via the steering wheel and via a knob on the roof
- It actually looks quite nice  
- Nice alternative model (tractor)

Cons
- The chairs are loose meaning they're only fixed using one pin. They tend to adjust themselves
- There's no floor. It looks too empty when you open the roof. The car would have looked far better with a decent floor in the cockpit.

I gave it 4 stars for the looks and the nice simple build. It really isn't anything special but I think it looks better than this years quad set when built up. All in all an okay set...

"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-05-15T16:03:44.327Z","Good Buggy, some flaws","<p>I got this set for my birthday, and it took me nearly two hours to build (time may vary). I was satisfied with the finished product, but I felt there were areas which could be improved. The buggy features:</p>
<ul>
<li>-4 cylinder engine</li>
<li>-3 suspension springs</li>
<li>-Roll-up cab cage</li>
<li>-2 adjustable seats</li>
<li>-Steering mechanism</li>
<li>-Sleek plating</li>
<li>-Spoilers</li>
<li>-Bumper</li>
<li>-Headlights</li></ul>
<p>The front suspension is independent, and the rear suspension consists of only a single spring, which I did not find amusing. Also, I noticed that the rear suspension feels a little stiff. This is because the whole swing arm connects to the rest of the buggy using friction pins, which reduces the spring's ability to bounce back. I have just completed modifications to provide another spring for the rear suspension, and used non-friction pins to ensure that&nbsp;the springs feel less resistant when the swing arm moves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also noticed that the framework of the buggy could bend sideways easily, especially near the front. This is because the buggy is only reinforced from the bottom; the roll-up cab cage serves no purpose whatsoever in reinforcing the buggy from the top. Modifications have been made, and I got rid of the roll-up cab cage feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was slightly disappointed to find out that the engine only connects to one wheel. However, this can be fixed easily so it's not too much of a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this set meets expectations but I see a lot of room for improvement. If you ever see this set you should get it (reasonable price) but you aren't missing out on anything if you don't.</p>

"Mandalorian","2010-10-24T14:50:34.943Z","Nice Buggy","Once again, Lego Technic makes a buggy. A nice one, by the way. Probably the best part is the steering, with a steering wheel just like in the blue 2008 dune buggy. Also, this one has a V4 engine, independent front suspension, and normal suspension in the back.

"SenatorBlutarsky","2011-03-31T01:33:25.673Z","Not bad, but could easily have been better","<p>Perhaps my expectations were a little bit too high, but after finishing the main model for this set, I found myself a little bit disappointed.&nbsp; It's not that this set was terrible, but I felt that it was missing something -- something that would make it unique in some way and spark my interest a little more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me start with the build.&nbsp; It took me less than an hour to build the main model.&nbsp; I didn't really find any part of the build particulary challenging or interesting, since all of the features in this model are pretty basic and Technic veterans will&nbsp;have seen them before in many other sets.&nbsp; By comparison, I found the 8271 wheel loader, which has only 200 pieces, to be a much more satisfying build, since it has a more interesting set of functions (see my review of that set if you are interested).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, the buggy does look pretty good when it is finished, especially if you apply the stickers (six of them -- one for each body panel).&nbsp; The roll cage, tubular front bumper, and overhead lights are particularly nice features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The completed model has the following features:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A working V4 engine that is driven by only one (!) of the rear wheels. 
<li>Steering via a HOG knob located behind the cockpit.&nbsp; For a change, the HOG&nbsp;steering mechanism is actually linked to the steering wheel in the cockpit. 
<li>Independent suspension for the front wheels. 
<li>Suspension for the entire rear axle as a unit (i.e. one shock absorber to handle both rear wheels). 
<li>A roll cage that may be opened up to gain access to the cockpit. 
<li>Seats that may be reclined.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is a decent set of features, but none of them are particularly special.&nbsp; I would have liked to see either independent suspension for the rear wheels or a rear differential (or both!).&nbsp; I don't think it would have been too difficult to add either of those features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The playability of this model is pretty good, since all the features work pretty much like you would expect.&nbsp; I particularly liked that the steering wheel in the cockpit is not just a decoration, as is usually the case.&nbsp; There are a few minor issues, though:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The turning radius is a little larger that I would have expected for a model of this size. 
<li>The model is a little flimsy because, as others have suggested, the entire frame is held together by the two lower frame rails.&nbsp; The roll cage and side panels do nothing to reinforce the structural stability of the model. 
<li>The front suspension is substantially stiffer than the rear suspension.&nbsp; This is not a huge issue, though, and we have certainly seen it before, in sets like the 8051 motorbike.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a parts inventory perspective, this set is pretty good.&nbsp; You get the V4 engine parts, the front suspension and steering parts that are sort of a poor man's version of the ones in the supercar sets (upper and lower control arms, tie rods, special mini steering rack, steering arms, shock absorbers), six body panels, four tires (two 56x26 and two 68.7x34), and about 10 gears/knobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, this set is good, and I don't regret buying it, but I felt that I got a somewhat better value for my money out of the 8051 motorbike and even the 8068 rescue helicopter (both of&nbsp;which retail for the same price, at least in the US).&nbsp; If you have $40 to spend, I'd recommend getting one of those sets first, unless you have a special interest in this type of set.</p>

"Techman","2011-11-28T17:22:19.29Z","Well done, but not perfect","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Having owned this set for a little over a year and a half, I found this set to be a nice set to add to my collection. When I first ordered it, I thought immediately that is was going to be a revision of an old 8296 dune buggy. Which technically it might be considered an upgrade model with more features. The main features on this set are: independent front suspension, rear suspension, V4 engine, and an opening top roll cage. This set is valued a little high I think for what is included in the set. The set has near 314 pieces for $40. That is a sort of pricey for this set. The main problem I have with the set is that only one of the rear wheels is connected to the engine. This was the same wheel issue in the 8296 set. The engine itself is larger than the 8296 set which is cool. The set does offer some panels to cover up the sides and back of the buggy. The independent suspension is great! I love those wishbone suspension arms. They are nice pieces to have to make creations of your own with. The front suspension is stiffer than in the rear for sure, which isn't bad, but it just feels weird when pushing it around. The set includes basic Lego Technic bricks, no real new pieces. I mainly got the set for its pieces as do most sets I buy, but this set had some appeal that I liked at first glance which caused me to buy it. I am pleased with the overall outcome of the set, but it just isn't all that I expected out of it. The size of the final model is actually big. For those amount of parts, it has a good size. To conclude, this set is great for display and is still worth the money to play with and for the parts.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,4,3,4,3
"N1ck3y","2012-01-18T12:05:11.653Z","Very fun","It's a very fun model to build and play with and also it gives you a pretty wide range of parts in my opinion although I do have a lot of Lego but it still has the usual dummy engine although it's a V4 this time and it also has front suspension. There is always a but though and it is that not that I have broken them but the ball joints that allow steering/suspension they seem a little weak but that doesn't matter.",FALSE,5,5,4,5,5
