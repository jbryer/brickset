<p>The pneumatic is back, and its realy nice.The pneumatic function works realy well, but it could use a pneumatif for the grapling hook to. It isn&acute;t that string, buts it strong enough to lift the lumber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wagon</b></p>
<p>Easy to bild, and great playability. Low partcount compared to the actual size. Fun to build, and fun to play with. A quite quick build great for kids just entering the realms of technic lego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>The Tractor</b></h4>
<p>The tractor is a little bit to simplex. Just one funktion (steering), and the front axel doesn&acute;t ethen pivit.&nbsp; But just like the wagon its a great size realtiv to the low partcount, its a great platform to include more functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Power function</b></h4>
<p>The power function elements its not included, but with this adition is makes the cheep B model into a classic A model. The power function isn&acute;t included, but its realy needed to give the model great playability. Its a lagre quantity of bricks included just for the power fuction element. The elements can&acute;t be used unless the power function elements is aded, costing an extra ~&euro;30. But its onely use the m-motor and the batterypack, so you can get away ith about &euro;15.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Conclution</b></h4>
<p>The Log loader is a great product, but it isn&acute;t perfekt. Including the power function removing all the dual parts (i.e the manual pneumatic parts)&nbsp; and including only the cheep power function parts and sell for &euro;59 in steed of &euro;49, giving it a 4 in value for money insted of a 5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pro</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pneumatic, great! Two functions, ethen greater.</li>
    <li>Compressor, yey, the first in 15 years!</li>
    <li>Easy build</li>
    <li>Nice looking</li>
    <li>The pnuematics is back!</li>
    <li>No stupid liner actuators</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
    <li>No PF for the compressor, ethen thow the compressor is included.</li>
    <li>No pivoting front wheel at the tractor</li>
    <li>Only one log</li>
    <li>No pnuematic for the grapling hook</li>

"headwerkn","2010-03-19T09:16:10.437Z","Pneumatic is back - but a bit half baked?","I just received this set as a birthday present (my girlfriend knows me too well, heh heh). The main model went together in a little over an hour, plus another 30 mins of modification for the Power Functions changes the following day (although much of that wasn't adding the compressor function, but rather figuring out a way to fit in the PF lights on the tractor). I'm yet to make the B model (who's instructions aren't included in the box... you have to download them), so based on that:<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pros:</span><br><br>Pneumatics are back! Given the other current Technic models all use those gear driven 'hydraulic' units I thought we might have seen the end of it.<br><br>Nice mix of parts... there's a few special bits I've not seen before in Technic. The lime green colours on the tractor are certainly different.<br><br>Compressor pump is included for PF conversion (but you'll have to pony up the extra ~AU$55 for the PF set to make use of it).<br><br>Forestry equipment models make a refreshing subject change after dozens of iterations of excavators, cranes, trucks and so on.<br><br>Price is not unreasonable.<br><br>It's an impressive size.<br><br>Instructions are dead simple.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cons:</span><br><br>Instructions are dead simple... in comparison to other ~AU$100 sets, it's a bit ""juniorised"" and comes together too quickly/easily.<br><br>Design on the models isn't as... well, shall we say 'perfected' as it usually is on a Technic model:<br><br>The tractor is a decent size but technically very simple, with only functioning steering, plus its design is very flimsy and lacking in suitable weight and heft to 'tow' the trailer around, which overwhelms it when you try to 'drive' it about. I know the tractor isn't the primary focus here, but it really should have swiveling front suspension and/or a piston engine to give it more detail.... and more weight.<br><br>The trailer has numerous design issues:<br><br>The hitch is too short, and fouls on the Tractor's rear tyres when turning tightly.<br><br>The cargo base has no floor, so your 'log' falls into the pump assembly.<br><br>The boom and jig are really, really flimsy. It's mostly single spar, wobbles about and makes actually trying to pick up anything a real challenge. It really needs to be more substantial ie. boxed up a bit.<br><br>The claw is manually controlled, rather than via a mini-pneumatic actuator, which would have been the ideal solution and improved the playability greatly. The claw's design isn't offset either, so the thin log actually isn't grabbed so much as cradled... so it usually falls out.<br><br>There's only ONE log. What the hell? Would it have mucked up the price point to have included half a dozen more?<br><br>The PF conversion is really, really flimsy. The motor is more located than fixed.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Final Thoughts:</span><br><br>It's great to see Pneumatics back again, but it is a shame that this set is just a bit half baked. I read somewhere it was rushed for Xmas or something to that effect, and if that's the case then you can definitely see it in the model. In comparison to the similarly priced <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8273-1"">8273 Off Road Truck</a> set, it just doesn't have the same solidness and well thought out design. It's not a bad model and certainly it is probably a better buy than some of the other sets around the same price point. For the sake of a 3rd pneumatic actuator, some more tractor detail and another overall design review though, what should have been a really awesome set turned out just a little bit average.<br><br><br>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,3

I bought it for £50 from The Entertainer and when i got home, i built the model straight away. Once i finished the model, i had a little play round with the pneumatics. Very soon after finishing the model, i did the motor upgrade so it had a constant supply of air. It was a good model but it was a bit slower then pumping by hand (or it may be due to the fact that the batteries were running out). The next day i built the B model and i liked that as the claw was pneumatic.

This set is not very complex but in this price range it is a good one. I was very happy when I heard that LEGO made a Technic set with pneumatic parts. I didn't have pneumatic before, so I was really excited taking my hands on it. <br>First part: the tractor.<br>Colours are great. Lime green and white look good together. It doesn't have a lot of function. It only has steering with a HOG. The size of the tractor is bigger than I expected.<br><br>Second part: the trailer. <br>This is the most interesting part of the set. It has two pneumatic cylinder and control switch. You can pump air with manual pump or a compressor. You can make the compressor with the Power Functions set. Pneumatic system works well. The turntable and the claw are manually operated.

"TopperTwist","2011-01-10T21:29:45.193Z","Downright AMAZING Set","<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Being amoung my first Technic sets,&nbsp;I really like this. Great parts, fun pnuematics, what's not to like? Review in short: If you like Lego Technic, then for sure pick this one up because it comes with great pnuematic parts and its very functional. </p>
<h4>The Build:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Being the first Technic set I've put together as a TFOL, the build was more complex than, City for say, but, I like a challenge and I'm sure this would be an easy build if your used to Technic. With two instruction manuals and instructions if you have the power functions set, this clarifies things.</p>
<h4>The Set:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This set is very functional and fun to play with.&nbsp;The controls are pretty simple, but once your used to them it's all smooth sailing. The set looks nice, except with only one feature on the cab, it's a bit boring and plain. The biggest problem with this set is the log. It's too short and falls into the inner chasis and valves when you drop it in witht the control arm. Also, there's only one, how cheap! Otherwise, a nice set.</p>
<h4>The Good:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The things that particularly stood out in a good way to me were the pnuematics, the build, the function, the smooth and simple controls, and all the mechanisms with the set. Also, the stabalizer beneath the control levers really support the set when you push down on the lever!</p>
<h4>The Bad:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The unmistakabley bad things about this set were the log, and the plainess of the cab. That's about all the problems though.</p>
<h4>Closing:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;For a nice price of $60, this is a good set. 525 is not bad for this set, considering the size, function, and PNUEMATICS that it comes with. (It's not cheap to add pnuematics to a set, I would assume). Overall, I would reccommend this set to anyone looking for pnuematics, anyone who loves Technic, or anyone willing to try Technic.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"av8r1973","2011-01-01T04:26:25.047Z","Nice kit, pneumatics, fun to play with","This is a relatively simple kit that went together far too quickly for me, but it is a low part-count set. &nbsp;The tractor looks great, but as others mention, it's a bit light. &nbsp;Why no other functions? &nbsp; 3-point hitch? Suspension?<div><br></div><div>The trailer is the real heart of the build and contains all pneumatics. &nbsp;Others complain about the flimsy arm, but I have actually operated a real one and it's just as wobbly. &nbsp;It was made for reach, not for weight capacity. &nbsp;I do agree that the drawbar is far too short and it doesn't allow even moderate turns when attached to the tractor.</div><div><br></div><div>The B-model was very cool to build and I love the grapple on that one, but I returned to the original model pretty quickly.</div><div><br></div><div>A better implementation of Power Functions would have been nice, but... &nbsp;The manual compressor is pretty quick and it adds some complexity to the model.</div><div><br></div><div>It is a refreshing build not related to construction, but it's a conversation piece in the collection. &nbsp;I hope they continue with non-construction machines and keep up the pneumatic work.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

<P style=""MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"" lang=EN-GB><FONT size=3><FONT face=""Times New Roman"">The trailer is clearly the main build, both in terms of building experience, functions and playability. The pneumatics are well integrated, and the only wish one could have is that a third cylinder had been included for operation of the claw. Instead the claw is operated manually with a set of gears, relying on the one-way function of the worm gear to ensure that the claw does not open when loaded. I personally think that the dimensions of the boom and claw are acceptable, of course they do not support very much load, but they are scaled to fit with the overall scale of the model. I can really recommend adding the power functions to the model, the movement of the pneumatics are much smoother when the small compressor is used with the m-motor, whereas the manual compressor is actually a bit to large and therefore the movement is more abrupt.<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></SPAN></p>

"tppytel","2011-08-15T00:33:06.807Z","Pneumatics and... not much else","Like many others, I purchased this set largely because it was the only recent one with pneumatics, which I hadn't yet gotten to play with. I also appreciated the break from the usual run of Technic construction vehicles and 4x4's. But, while the set isn't <span style=""font-style: italic;"">bad</span>, it doesn't really do anything well either - you get to see pneumatics in action and that's about it.<br><br>Design: Fairly boring. The only significant function in the whole set is the pneumatic arm and the rotating platform it sits on. The tractor doesn't do anything beyond hand-of-God steering and the trailer is simply a wheeled platform for the crane arm. While the crane arm is fairly neat and the obvious attraction for the set, it's not so fantastic as to carry the entire set by itself. It's also somewhat annoying that the claw function requires turning a knob on the claw rather than being controlled from the trailer base. That's probably just a technical limitation of passing functions through the rotating platform, but it still <span style=""font-style: italic;"">feels</span> a little lacking. I haven't yet built the B model - it looks like only a slight variation on the same basic idea, but perhaps the arm differs more significantly than it first appears to.<br><br>Build: Building the arm and the pneumatics is fun. The other 400 or so pieces... not so much. That's all just very basic beam construction. Obviously you can't have every single piece in a Technic set do something exciting, but I've seen more interesting builds in sets that are half the size of this one. Everything was well laid-out in the manual, at least, even the trickier bits involving routing the various pneumatic hoses. <br><br>Parts: OK, I guess. I don't do Technic MOC's, so I have a hard time judging this. You get the pneumatic pieces, obviously, but you could just as well order those separately. Beyond those and the green panels, it seems like a pretty typical selection of beams and joints. <br><br>Playability: Mediocre. I would be more willing to overlook the boring build if the model at least worked well when it was done. Part of the problem is the spindly little log provided - it looks too small and is somewhat hard to pick up in the claw. Unfortunately, a log built from large round bricks would be a bit too large and Lego hasn't made them in brown anyway. Apart from that, the pneumatic action on the crane arm is a bit jerky, which sometimes leads to the itty bitty log slipping out of the claw's clutches. And again, actually opening or closing the claw requires that you grab it and turn the knob, which breaks the illusion of operating the machinery. In the end, the model works, but feels fussier and less effective than other Technic sets I've built.<br><br>Overall, this set demonstrates basic pneumatic construction techniques and nothing more. I purchased it for less than the MSRP even after it was already out of production - at that price, I'm happy to have it, if only as an example of pneumatics and as a somewhat unique vehicle in the Technic line. But this is a definitely not a set worth hunting after and paying collector's prices for. If you want to play around with pneumatics, just order the key parts and you can probably build a working arm from this set's downloadable manual and whatever extra Technic beams you've got lying around. That would get you most of what this set offers at a fraction of the price.<br>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3
