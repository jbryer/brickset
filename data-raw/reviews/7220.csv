<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Sturdy box and clear enough instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Really bought this for the clear 16x16 plates, everything else was gravy.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>nice &quot;microfigs&quot;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very easy build</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Should have seen this back in 2009, would have stocked on these to resell later on...</p>
