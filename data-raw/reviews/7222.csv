"parchioso","2009-09-08T04:19:47.357Z","The 7 models of Lego BrickMaster Castle ","May be you won't believe it, I got this set as early as July, from a place that you could have never imagined - 7-11 convenient store in Hong Kong. This is an interesting product combining a book with a lego set.

The high quality printing makes the 45 pages book a collector item, the book is not for illustrating Lego castle information as some people thinks, it is actually an instruction manual for 7 alternatives models that you can build with the included bricks, but it is printed at high quality that no Lego manual had been produced like this before, and there is a compartment used to keep the bag of bricks.

Minifigs: 7/10. skeleton and soldier, Just Ordinary, but good to fit in what the set can offer 

Parts: 8/10. Not that there are great parts, but the value lies in the models that the same set of bricks can be used to build

Playability 10/10: With so many alternative models to build, rarely can a set be having such good playability

Price: 10/10. 2 minifigs and 140+ pieces plus a nice printed book is a good deal, it is also great as a gift to kids 

Overall: 9/10. This is truly a great value set! I would highly recommend it (subject to the price in your region may be).

"myater","2010-06-15T20:18:22.297Z","Decent additional set","<p>I got this from my local Barns &amp; Noble for a little over the Amazon price, but you figure in shipping and it would have been close at least.</p>
<p><br/>Not too bad of a set.&nbsp; Great for adding to an existing set or just having a 1 on 1 battle with some fortifications.</p>
<p><br/>Easy builds, but not as satisfying as some others, but the compilation of 7 printed sets is an additional brick.</p>
<p><br/>Again a good assortment af parts, but the price is the kicker, at about $24 (US)&nbsp; I am not sure that the 140ish parts really warrant the cost, even with the nice instruction booklet.</p>
<p><br/>I really was hoping that as a ""Book"" it would have a small section about the Castle / Kingdoms theme, where it started and where it may be going, but I didn't see anything like that.&nbsp; I am unsure why it was even put in a ""Book"" format at all.&nbsp; Kinda odd.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T21:35:02.343Z","Here there be Skeletons","<p>LEGO Castle Brickmaster: Last year DK released two Brickmaster themed books, LEGO Pirates and LEGO Castle, both 'books' are more like high-end LEGO sets for your chosen Theme, involving a set number of pieces, two Mini-Figures and instructions to build a certain number of models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LEGO Castle book has less models to build compared to the Pirates book, but that isn't altogether a bad thing, because what you can build is all very impressive. Let's look at what Models can be built.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seven Scenes and 13 Amazing LEGO Models, that's what you can build with LEGO Castle, the first of the seven scenes is called Two Castles. The first scene also uses all of the pieces included in the book to build its models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Model #1 in this book is a small Weapons rack to hold the Knights arsenal. Model #2 builds a small catapult to defend the Knight's castle from the evil Skeleton. Model #3 is a Chariot which the Skeleton Horse pulls. Model #4 is the Knight's castle, a small little Castle that looks more like it could be part of a much larger model, I bet it could become the top of a tower on one of the many LEGO Castles. Model #5 is the Skeleton's castle, a menacing looking tower built with red, black and white pieces that could be considered a small prison from the way it's built up and looks. A place where the Skeleton can imprison the Knight should he succeed in defeating him in battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second Scene is titled Castle Jail. It creates only one model, Model #6 the titular Castle Jail. I think this model is really quite impressive, it actually looks like it can be a small little jail out in the middle of a forest or something where the enemy is kept from his allies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third Scene Skull Castle builds two models up, Model #7 the Skeleton's fort, although to be perfectly honest I think this is more like it could be the top of something much larger, a tower or a fort or something. It's not bad looking, but I think it could use some serious MOCing to build it up. Model #8 is the Weapon Cart for the Knight, used to transport all of the weapons into battle against the Skeleton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scene four, Castle Chariot, one model is built using a small number of pieces, the Skeleton's Chariot, a spike tipped chariot used to transport the Knight as a prisoner... It isn't much of a prison though since the Knight could, in theory, just leap out. But perhaps there's a magic spell on it to keep him trapped. Model #9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scene five, Castle Lookout, is another singular model build making up a Lookout for the Skeleton, once again this isn't much of a fortress, but it could be the top of something much larger, just as before... Actually, if you were to pick up a lot of spare pieces to build up these models I'd wager you could take all of the Skeleton related 'Castles/Forts' and use them as additional pieces to a MOCed Skeleton Mini-Fort. Model #10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scene Six, Castle Battle, the book calls Model #11 a Seaside Fort for the Knight to defend his Island. This little story blurb really makes the Model stand out as impressive looking, but I think it looks more like the gateway to a small island fort rather than a fort itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final scene is called Castle Defense, it features the final two models that can be built using the pieces included with this book. Model #12, a Skull Chariot for the Skeleton to use to invade the Knight's territory. It looks quite menacing and can easily take on the Knight's Model #13, the Knight's Fort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these models are fun and quite interesting, they are built using the 140 pieces included in this book. I feel that there could be a lot of potential with these builds also, for MOCers and the like it's entirely possible that you could take everything from this book and enhance it further, if you combined the three Skeleton 'Castles' you could make a mini-fort or have a basis for creating a miniature fort that would stand out as quite menacing and forbodeing looking, with a jail, a catapult defense tower and a watchtower. But you'd need enough spare pieces to pull it off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book is worth picking up though for another reason, it includes not only a Knight and Skeleton Mini-Figure, but a Skeleton Horse as well, one of the rarer animals from LEGO's Castle Theme. Endless hours of fun and play can also be had with this item. You may want to try and get it for half price though, if you're a bit squemish at the price of the title.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
