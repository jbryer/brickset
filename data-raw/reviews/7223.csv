"round3","2009-08-29T07:06:04.543Z","Let's get started folks!","First of all this set did not appear with regular Lego sets but was on a special display bookshelf along with the similar DK Castle book. The front cover has a slim box attached to it that contains a bag of bricks and a cardboard tray.

The Book.

Instructions are included for 6 scenarios (and 16/17 models) as follows:

Treasure Island (Weapons Rack, Raft 1, Tropical Cave, Fort and Cannon 1)
Pirate Beach (Island Harbour and Boat)
Island Harbour Fort (Raft 2, Treasure Holder and Harbour Fort)
Pirate Prison (Treasure Platform, Cannon 2 and Prison)
Island Fort (Catapult 1 and Island Fort)
Weapons Cart (Catapult 2 and Weapons Cart)

The instructions briefly introduce you to each scenario and also explain each models use prior to the instructions .

The Bricks.

The 140 bricks allow you to assemble only the models for one of the scenarios at a time. So you can have all the models for the Treasure Island scenario built at the same time but do not have enough bricks to make models for the other scenarios without dismantling. Not a problem.

The Minifigures.

You can see both these guys on the picture above. The One-legged Pirate is on a single minded search for the treasure which the Soldier is sworn to protect.

Overall

Some of the models are better than others and I ended up settling mainly on a modified version of one of the scenarios and I expect the bricks will be used to supplement other Pirate sets which I hypothesize is what this set is great for although if this was your only Pirate set you could have many a swashbuckling adventure as it is. Argh

"mags","2009-08-30T04:07:15Z","Nice for the kids...","Having recently come back to LEGO as my kids (8 and 3 1/2) are getting hooked, I mainly picked these up to save for a rainy Sunday morning. Turned out to be needed a rainy Saturday afternoon....

Pros:

- Nice presentation, large pictures and easy to follow even for the 3 yr old
- 2 cool minifigs, especially like the wooden-legged pirate
- Treasure map!
- As mentioned in earlier review, easy to take apart and rebuild other modles. Excellent play value for children.

Cons:

- Placement of brick-box on front index page. Makes the book front-heavy.
- Price - a little on the expensive side, but that may be down to larger than usual production costs

All in all, definitely something for the kids, and the book ""form factor"" presentation makes an interesting deviation from the norm.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"parchioso","2009-09-08T07:05:46.467Z","A collector's item with great playability","I think this set+book product provides great value, you got over 140 bricks and 2 minifigs (imperial soldier and pirate), and a very nicely printed instruction book, which contains ways to use this set to build 6 different models! And there are also quite a number of good parts! And being able to come up with so many models with the same set of material is simply astonishing. 

It is fun to have a set that can be quickly built, yet can multiply the fun by having multiple models, each offers a different play set, this also helps to inspire people to maximize the power of bricks even with a small number of parts.

You can find pictures on this product and some of the models built at my blog:

"NickBrick","2011-01-04T19:46:01.64Z","This set truly captures the spirit of Lego Pirates!","<p>First I do want to point out that the box says you can build 16 models. Actually you can only build six. I guess LEGO was counting each model in each set. Oh well, on to the review me harties!&nbsp; The first set you build is what you see on the box. A raft, a cave, a tower, a weapons rack, and a cannon. All of which are well designed considering the creators had to build four other completely different models with the same bricks. The cannon cannot fire, but I suspect that was done for simplicity. The cave makes a truly excellent pirate hang out, with enough space to seat two pirates. the second set you can make is called ""Pirate Beach"". It includes a beach with a pirate cooking some grub. It also includes something that looks like half a cave. Attacking the pirate is an imperial guard, driving some sort of steam powered boat. The boat is the only model I hate in the entire set.</p>&nbsp;The third set is called ""Island Harbor Fort"". It includes a small harbor that could be an attempt to recreate the Imperial trading post from 1992. It has a catapult(Imperial guards used catapults?) that can launch<br>a small rock at the incoming pirate on another raft. Apparently the pirate wants the treasure chest that is sitting on the small rock pile next to the harbor. The fourth set is called ""Pirate Prison"". <br><p>It includes a small jail cell made out of rock and wood with some leaves on top and the pirate flag hanging high atop. The pirate has a small gun kart that is similar to 1970 Pirate gun kart.&nbsp; There is also a small bench that a has a treasure chest sittin on top. The fifth and largest set you can build is called ""Island Fort"". It has a very large three story tower as well as a pirate who is attacking the tower with a mobile catapult. The tower's first level is a hole where a treasure chest is buried. The second level has a small weapons rack as well as a map for a for a treasure buried on some other island. The third level is an open place for the guard to fire at the pirate with his pistol. The finale set is called ""Weapons Cart"" It includes a kart to carry some muskets and the treasure. The pirate is using a stationary catapult&nbsp; to ambush the guard. The kart is rather large and is useful for carting supplies to your fellow guards some where. When all is said and done This DK pirates set is quite impressive and is very fun to play with. I suggest you pick it up if you see it. The most common places to find this set is at Borders and Barne's and noble's. I hope my review was helpful. Have a nice day me shipmate.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,4
"myater","2010-06-15T20:19:13.653Z","Decent additional set","<p>I got this from my local Barns &amp; Noble for a little over the Amazon price, but you figure in shipping and it would have been close at least.</p>
<p><br/>Not too bad of a set.&nbsp; Great for adding to an existing set or just having a 1 on 1 battle with some fortifications.</p>
<p><br/>Easy builds, but not as satisfying as some others, but the compilation of 7 printed sets is an additional brick.</p>
<p><br/>Again a good assortment af parts, but the price is the kicker, at about $24 (US)&nbsp; I am not sure that the 140ish parts really warrant the cost, even with the nice instruction booklet.</p>
<p><br/>I really was hoping that as a ""Book"" it would have a small section about the Castle / Kingdoms theme, where it started and where it may be going, but I didn't see anything like that.&nbsp; I am unsure why it was even put in a ""Book"" format at all.&nbsp; Kinda odd.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T17:07:36.883Z","Avast There! Heave to the Mizenmasts!","<p>LEGO Pirates Brickmaster: When I first learned that DK was bringing out some books featuring LEGO I was actually looking forward to seeing what these could be. When I finally got my hands on them for Christmas last year I was amazed at the diversity of the books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the DK Brickmaster Books involves giving you instructions for a number of different models using a certain number of pieces, and as a bonus you are also given a pair of Mini-Figures with which to stage little mock battles using the models in each book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pirates Book features one Soldier and one Pirate and a grand total of 16 minature models to choose from. To call this a book however would be misleading, it is more like an activity book or toy on a much larger scale than your typical LEGO set. The price on these are a bit on the high side too considering the page count, most 30$ books will give you average of 800 pages some more, some less. But this is a more unique style of book, also it helps if you can get it at half price from Amazon or a store like Costco. (Where I got most of my LEGO books.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These books are also not just for children, after all it specifies ages 5 and up, so they can be enjoyed by all age brackets, even us AFOLs. (Also I happen to be a Theme Completist/Semi-Completist so these things are must haves in my collection.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now on to the models that can be built. The book says sixteen models, this is of course misleading, you do build sixteen, but it is between a grand total of six Themed scenes.</p>
<p>The first of which is titled Treasure Island. Now count with me folks as we go through these Themed scenes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Treasure Island you first start by building a small weapon rack to hold your cutlass, your blunderbust, your treasure map, your shovel and your musket. All of which belong to the Soldier. Model #1. After this simple build you make up a minature raft built out of shipwreck parts I'd wager for the pirate. Model #2. To hide the treasure from prying eyes you must now build a small cave. Model #3. A miniature Fort follows from which the Soldier will stand fast and defend the treasure from Priates. Model #4. Last, but not least you use some pieces to make a small cannon. Model #5. Treasure Island is now complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as builds go it is fairly straight forward and simple, something you might find in a small 10-12$ regular boxed set. It does not use all 140 Pieces included with this book however, in fact so far LEGO Pirates Brickmaster is the only book in which none of the Mini-Scenes use all of the parts to build the models. There are always at least a few leftovers. However a bit of MOCing and you can insert most of the remaining pieces into sections of the first five models in the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pirate Beach: Using most of the same pieces from before we will now build up a defensible location for the Pirate to protect his ill-gotten booty from the Soldier. Pirate Beach's first model is called an Island Harbor. Model #6. It uses a fair number of pieces to build up a passable little harbor on the island the Pirate is holed up on to defend the treasure.<br/>Also a part of this scene is a Boat for the Soldier to travel to the island and reclaim the treasure. Model #7. It's really quite ingenious looking as far as ships go, it appears to be a miniature steam powered wheel-ship. Really nifty looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Island Harbor Fort: Scene #3... The Soldier has reclaimed the Treasure and must now defend it once again from the Pirate. This scene involves constructing a different type of Raft for the Pirate to use. Model #8. A small pedestal for the treasure chest to rest on. Model #9 and the titular Island Harbor Fort. Model #10. All three of these models are quite nice and I especially like the Island Harbor Fort, it looks fairly defensible and includes a small catapult to fend off the Pirate. This new Raft also looks as though the Pirate had to build it in a hurry, since it uses two tree fronds in its construction. The scene is a nice one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pirate Prison: Scene #4... The Pirate has captured the Soldier and is holding him in a small prison on the island while he protects the Treasure until Brickbeard can come fetch him. You build a small platform to hold the treasure chest on. Model #11. A wheeled dual-musket gun emplacement (the book calls this a cannon.), which is quite impressive looking. Model #12. And of course the Pirate Prison of the title. Model #13.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the prison stands out as one of the better models from this book. You build it with a fair amount of the pieces included and it holds the Soldier quite well as far as prisons go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scene #5 is called Island Fort: The LEGO Soldier has somehow escaped his prison, reclaimed the treasure and now stands at the top of a fort ready to defend himself against the Pirate. This scene uses the pieces to build up what they call the 'Pirate's Secret Weapon'. Modle #14. It's really just a wheeled catapult, but it is quite a clever little model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Model #15 is the Island Fort, standing taller than the Harbor Fort of before it includes a place for the Treasure, a built in weapons rack and a small harbor. It's really the crown piece of this group of Models, true some of them are quite fun looking and interesting, but the Island Fort is like something you'd find in the original Pirates days. A nifty little model that can be MOCed up with spare pieces to truly shine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final scene is called Weapons Cart: You get to build two more models with this scene, Model #16 a catapult for the Pirate to use to try and steal the treasure and Model #17, the Weapons Cart, for transporting weapons, treasure and anything else your imagination can come up with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So... There you go. Overall I'd have to say that this is a nice little Conversation piece for LEGO enthusiasts and it offers up a ton of playability for the children this book is aimed at. For older collectors I'd have to say it all depends on how you view this as. A LEGO Set, a little pricey, but something that offers up numerous models to try your hand at. Or a simple little children's book designed to entertain the young and therefore not really in your age range or interest level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could also pick up a large selection of bricks from LEGO shop at home to make all of the models included in this book if you were so inclined and have 17 fun little additional models to display with your Pirates collection. In theory at any rate. I strongly advise you to try and get this for half price though, because in all honesty paying 30$ for this over one of the 30$ LEGO sets is a tad on the steep side.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,5
"oscholes","2011-09-25T13:35:31.047Z","Great fun!","<p>This is not the most cost-effective set, but I still think it's a nice addition to any collection. There's a nice variety of pieces, two minifigures, and instructions for a half-dozen builds (the advertising on the outside is a bit misleading). The assortment of pieces also makes designing your own builds easy and a lot of fun, and I've got quite a lot of mileage out of the relatively small number of pieces in this set. I think young builders will really enjoy this, and the book format makes it the sort of thing you could easily take on vacation (always a bonus, as Lego can often be a bit difficult to transport). Older builders may not find that it has as much to offer, but I think this is a nice addition to the product line, and it was certainly a nice addition to the ""Pirates"" corner of my collection!<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,3

"Lego_fan_","2019-01-14T21:04:23.4Z","A lot of builds.","<p>This is a really great set for the original price and it comes with a nice part selection. It comes with a British officer and a Pirate. It also comes with Instructions for multiple models which sadly cannot be built at the same time but it is great for when one gets bored with a model they can build a new one. I love this set and would suggest it to anyone that likes Pirates or the Brickmaster theme.</p>

"covfefe2020","2020-05-03T20:34:47.957Z","Great compliment","<p>I remember getting this book while I was enamored with the lego pirates theme. It went perfectly with my other 2 sets (6240 and 6241).&nbsp; The Book has a well made aesthetic and the builds are amazing! Each alternate build is equally as good, with all of them being imaginative and fitting in well with whatever you need, the soldiers fort and cave area my favorites. The minifigures are fine. Its nice to have a peg leg included with the pirage and the soldier comes with a fine arnament of tools and weapons.</p>
