With this set there is no chance of burning down the house so the kids could have it in their room. And then you can reuse it every year.<br><br>The set comes with 24 printed 4x2 bricks in very nice quality. A lot of white tile pieces make it very easy to separate the individual stages in the candle and simply put them aside in a plastic bag or something.<br><br>The candle comes in a nice sturdy box (harder than normal Lego boxes) and with nicely printed instructions.<br><br>It may be a bit expensive but considering the specially printed pieces and the overall quality it is very recommended.",TRUE,5,5,4,3,4
