If you are the kind of guy who doesn't like buying Lego figures that are just a bunch of basic bricks put together that make something, or something that has a keychain screwed into its head, this is the only set available this year that has poseable, customizeable, flawless Santa Claus minifigure. 

Up close, the Santa's just a plain faced minifig with a white wizard/dwarf beard wearing a red pirate bandana, a plain red torso with yellow hands, and a pair of red legs and a plain black belt sans buckle.

The rest of the set is pretty nice. With the dish-translucent cylinder lantern, a small pine tree, two headlight/license plate brick things and two magnet bricks. The magnet bricks dont have an open bottom so they arent easy to work with with the set alone, and only the bottom is magnetic. But I was surprised, being the first magnet set I ever bought, that this mini-vignette was completely dissassemblable...dis...you could take it apart, all in all, for other uses. So the set can either be a magnet, made into a horseless sleigh that can ride along that steel bedframe you probably have, or other creations if you dont think lego should also serve as a household refridgerator decoration.

Cons:
The santa figure couldve been a little more accurate, with white gloves, an old man face and some body reprolabels. And the set comes with those dang stickers we all hate. Especially the one that has been pre-stuck to 1x8 flat brick because the sticker is bigger than the brick itself. In fact, you can see it stick out a little in the pic above.

Overall:
This is a ""Take it or Leave it"" set. Like I said, It is the ONLY way you can get a Santa minifig that isn't just a bunch of bricks or has a keychain screwed in its head as of this year, and in my opinion the only real reason to get this set at all. It's a little more priced than the other magnet set of two years ago and double the price of the keychain alone, but if you've been missing out on Santas for years and have ten bucks to spare then you better get it while the getting is good, and those extra bricks will definitely come in handy for future creations. 

Or you can wait next holiday season and make your own Santa Claus by improvising with the pieces you happen to have at the bottom of your bucket in the meantime. Or that Mecha Santa that guy made. That's up to you.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
