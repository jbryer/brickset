"peti7788","2022-06-30T20:47:31.17Z","Small police station with 5 vehicles","<p>This is the European version of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/585-1/Police-Headquarters"" target=""_blank"">585</a> set.&nbsp;Everything is the same except for the set&nbsp;number.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>In this set of sculpture figures, the size of the buildings did not follow the size of the sculpture figures. So the building was not compatible with the sculpture figures, just an ornament made of many bricks.&nbsp;Because the back of these Legoland-themed buildings is also built in, what a waste! And instead of raising the height of the buildings with an extra 1 row of bricks to fit the sculptural figures, they more added more vehicles to the set. This compensated for the unusable interior. Yet before the appearance of the sculptural figures, there were already 5 brick-high doors that belonged to the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Minitalia"" target=""_blank"">Minitalia</a> sets.</p>

<p>Regardless, it&rsquo;s still a nice and playable set with just fewer features.</p>

<p>There are interesting things here. The police inscription was used on HO-scale cars in the 1950s Town Plan sets, mostly used at gas stations.&nbsp;The other thing is the antenna built from the plate, but it is attached to the roof with an illegal technique.&nbsp;And of course the easy-to-break TV antenna, which costs a fortune these days.</p>

<p>A callbox is a good idea! In reality, they didn&#39;t have to throw a coin in, they could only be used by the police and they had a key to open them. In the big cities, there was one on almost every street, especially downtown. Until cheaper portable cb radios became widespread.</p>

<p>The helicopter landing is interesting. There is an &quot;<em>L10</em>&quot; sign&nbsp;instead of the standard <em>H</em> sign.&nbsp;I have no idea what the &quot;<em>L10</em>&quot; sign refers to.&nbsp;But I think a H mark from 7 pc 2x2 yellow tiles would have been much nicer, more usable and cheaper.</p>

<h3>Vehicles&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Paddy wagon</p>

<p>Or you can use it as a SWAT Van. It&#39;s fine, but i don&#39;t like the fake printed bars&nbsp;on the sides, if the designer used a 1x4x1 fence piece, it would much better solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Patrol car</p>

<p>Very simple. Just couple seconds needed to put together.&nbsp;The siren on the roof, the other illegal connection, just like on the paddy wagon.&nbsp;Whatever it may be, the sedans were exactly the same at the time. It could be Dodge Monaco or Triumph 2000 or Opel Record, Opel Admiral, which your eyes see.</p>

<p>Police bikes</p>

<p>I have no criticism, these motorcycles are perfect!&nbsp;Especially when we know there were few parts available at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Helicopter</p>

<p>Same as like in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/369-1/Coast-Guard-Station"" target=""_blank"">369 set</a>, with the difference that the front has been expanded here so that the 2x3 printed brick used in the police car can be used here as well.&nbsp;And no tail rotor. I think the pylons are unnecessary because this is an surveillance helicopter and not a rescue helicopter, it is not important to be able to land on the water.&nbsp;I would have preferred to put wheels under the fuselage like the one used for motorcycles.</p>

<h3>Sculpture figures</h3>

<p>The belt was made of 1x2 white plate that was placed between the foot and the torso. No printed face.&nbsp;The cap, on the other hand, is the same as that used in later sets and is still used today for minifigures.&nbsp;The hands and feet are not movable, and you only know from the direction of the cap that this is now the front or back of the figure.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Very cute set of a lot of traditional bricks.&nbsp;With fewer game features than today&rsquo;s sets, but that was enough for kids back then. If you&rsquo;re so lucky to have the original box, there are many interesting and nice alternative vehicles on the back.</p>

<h3>My Mod</h3>

<p>I put more details in the building, such as a blue call box, than in reality.&nbsp;And to keep it from getting boring, I also placed an extra tree and a hydrant.</p>

<p>I put a skylight on the roof and remodeled the helicopter landing as mentioned earlier.&nbsp;I put two lights at the entrance next to the police sign.</p>

<p>I doubled the same 1x6 printed brick.&nbsp;The vehicles were not left out of the conversion either, I modified them for the reasons mentioned above.</p>

<p>The police car also got a brake light and I made a version in which I skipped the printed headlights and used transparent plates.</p>
