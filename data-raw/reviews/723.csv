This set is an ok boat but it is really simple, plain and made from regular colored bricks. The slope decoration is printed and there is a propeller included but everything else is standard LEGO bricks in red or blue. Not much to make you run out and buy this set, unless you want to complete the series.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
