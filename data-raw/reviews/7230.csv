"lego_here","2009-09-05T08:52:19.14Z","the cheapest lego star wars set!!","pros 
cheap set
you get a figure
nice addition to any collection
I like the way they used axes to move instead of the usual skis you can get

cons
should have a scout figure instead of a stormtrooper
should come in a small box than packet

If you are a star wars fan in the uk then you must get this as it is only available to get today.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2009-09-05T10:02:08.433Z","Imperial Speeder Bike","I got this free with the Daily Mirror today. It comes in a little plastic bag with fold-out instructions. It is really fun to play with and comes with a stormtrooper.

Always put the Stormtrooper's arms below the controls, otherwise the clips below the handles will ease off.

Pros:
Stormtrooper
Good design
Quite fun to play with
Free!

Cons:
Can't hold onto the controls


Overall, very good for a promo, 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2010-01-04T18:21:34.153Z","Axe axels?","This is my favourite of the 30004/5/6 sets. Before I built it I didn't think it would actually look like it was floating, but the axe axels take care of that. I am surprised however that this set didn't have a scout trooper, seeing as it is blatantly based on Endor, but I suppose LEGO is sticking with the most well known of each faction. I also find it surprising that there was no rebel one! Come on LEGO, its not that hard!

Pros:

Petite build
Doesn't take up much space
Stormtrooper
Axe axels
Price is just as petite as the build

Cons:

Nothing

THis set is a fantastic bargain and is good if, like me, your brother got all the sets with lots of Stormtroopers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ChrisBricks1138","2009-09-05T15:33:51.17Z","Imperial Speeder","I got this set from the Daily Mirror Newspaper:

Pros: Stormtrooper Minifig
        Great design
        Good range of pieces

Cons: You have to turn the hands upside-down to fit the handlebars

This is a small, well designed promo set and I rate it 10/10 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cal_Zagy","2009-09-05T12:01:55.593Z","A Great Lego Star Wars Set","This set is great value for money, 65p (cost of the Daily Record) for 33 pieces is an amazing price to piece ratio. The set is a great addition to any Star Wars collection.

-Lego handguns as controls
-Stormtrooper
-Inexpensive
-Axes

Cons
-None

"thewish","2009-12-21T06:19:33.047Z","Mini Speeders","I got this with the Mirror promotion and like the others, the set is great. The one thing that appealed to me was that the speeder was minifigure-sized and it came with a stormtrooper. To me, that's just plain awesome.

PROS-
Little speeder
Small
Cheap
Minifig sized
Stormtrooper
Interesting use of pieces (e.g axe as thrusters

CONS-
None

Get a few of these and those Rebels better run.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>I got this set mainly for the stormtrooper minifig, since I only have one. The set is great, it never falls apart, and the use of pieces amazes me because its so creative! I think this was some young&nbsp;builder who gave his idea to LEgo-hope he got credit. Pros and Cons:</p>

"tkettle9719","2012-01-08T09:48:13.617Z","An Amazing Polybag Minifig set!","I got this set for myself after Christmas a few years ago at Toys 'R' Us for myself, and think that is is a truly innovative set that never really appeared in the movies, and a fantastic way to build an army of Stormtroopers.<h4>Pros</h4>
