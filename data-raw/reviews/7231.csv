"bluemoose","2009-09-06T07:04:36.233Z","Good set ... for the money.","It's a nice little set - it isn't a challenging build, nor is it a great model, but it does contain a nice selection of parts. Includes 5 of the little 1x1 slopes in light grey - four for the model & one spare.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"ggggggggggggggggggggggggg","2009-09-06T13:53:52.513Z","Great for a promo set!","This is a great set, and is definetly worth the price, the clone itself is worth more than the price, and if you buy lots of them it will really add alot to your clone army.The legs look a bit too short in the pic but in real life they look alright.Now to the pros and cons.

Pros

Turret can turn
Clone
Price
parts
Looks good

Cons
I can't think of any

Overall I really suggest you get this too bad it's only avaible in the UK.

"ChrisBricks1138","2009-09-06T10:20:11.403Z","Best small set for a long time","As with the Imperial Speeder bike, I got this from the dailly mirror:

Pros:

Nice little turret on the front
Poseable legs
Amazing design
Good army builder (if your prepared to buy more than one daily mirror)

Cons:

No blaster for the clone

Overall, this set is one of my favourite mini sets of all time and a great addition to the clone wars collection",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Stayontargetprod","2009-10-13T23:03:35.403Z","Great Set!","I'm probably one of the handful of people who have this set in the US. I got it for about 6 USD. And it was worth it. It's a great mini set. It has a movable gun. And it's small enough to fit in the 7676 Republic Gunship. It's great for stopmotion and MOCS.

Pros
Movable Legs
Complete Clone Trooper
Movable Gun
Fits in 7676 Gunship
Has several details.
Great Stocking Stuffer item for young kids

Cons
No hand gun/blaster for clone trooper.
The handle pieces aren't great. I personally don't like those pieces.

This is a good set for a young starting lego builder.
If you want to see it in action, Go here!

"Cal_Zagy","2009-09-07T15:24:52.95Z","Another Great Lego Star Wars Set","This set is fairly good as a small walker and is a excellent as an army builder. Again the price to pieces ratio is excellent, (especially since I was given two sets not one when I bought the Sunday Mail [£1.30].) I was also really lucky that the person at WHSmith was willing to give me one set without having to buy the newspaper.

Pros:
-The gun piece is movable
-Clone Trooper
-Price (£1.30 in the Sunday Mail)
-Great parts
-Looks nice as a small walker
-Legs move easily

Cons:
-None.

Overall a 5 star set.

"Carl","2010-01-04T18:27:25.483Z","Mini Clone Walker with minifig!","This set is very good, although personally I like the Imperial one more. The walker has a really nice build and unlike the Imperial one, it has a seat backing. The legs are bendable which is a plus, and you can pull the front part forward for reasons I don't really understand apart from getting it on a good angle.

Pros:

Bendable legs
Clone trooper
Gun thing
Build
Levers

Cons:

None

This set is also very good for learning, as I finally learnt how to put the levers in a minifigs hand. Yes, I am a little slow.

Anyway, get this set because it is good for army building pr just keeping on its own or making a general guy sit on it so he looks like the leader.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"EtudeTheBadger","2011-03-21T17:36:08.957Z","Walk Tall! (actually, scratch that)","I found this polybagged set today at my local supermarket for the reasonable amount of £2, and for the price, it does not disappoint!<br><p>A lucky find, this.The model is easy and fun to build, with some interesting parts and good maneuverability - the legs really articulate well, unlike many previous walkers, and the way the cannon is built is near genius! I also think the seat is brilliant. I know, that sounds a bit random, but I like the tan plate on the backrest. <br></p><p>Another thing that's great about this set is that the walker-to-clone size ratio is pretty good too. A lot of clone walkers just look too big for the rider, but this set gets it right.</p><p>There's just one thing wrong with the set - the clone trooper has no blaster! What if his walker gets blown up and he's stranded somewhere without a gun?! A way of stowing a blaster on the walker would have been good.<br></p><p>Never mind.</p><p>If you can't be bothered to read my hopelessly long-winded review, just glance at the list below:</p><h4>Pros and Cons at a Glance</h4><ul><li>Pros:</li><li>Easy to build</li><li>Low price</li><li>Comes with a clone</li><li>Some good techniques used here</li></ul><ul><li>Cons:</li><li>No blaster - missed opportunity</li></ul>The sad thing about this set is that it's so hopelessly hard to find. If you do get hold of this superb walker, you're in for a great build and a great model! That is, if you CAN get hold of it...<br><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"orybloodmyre","2011-03-20T15:59:44.643Z","For a freebie, you can't moan!","<p>I was pretty gutted when I booked a weeks holiday and missed the oppurtunity to get one of these from the promotion in the newspaper. Luckily though, lots of other people got them and you can't go on ebay.co.uk without running into one in the lego section, so I managed to get this and the storm trooper with speeder bike, and the battle droid on STAP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I love this walker and clone. I dont know if it is supposed to be an AT-RT from episode III or if it is a walker from the clone wars TV series, but either way its pretty awesome. It looks&nbsp;a little too small to be an AT-RT but it could be that it is just a mini version as the mini speeder bike that comes with the storm trooper looks too small as well. But for freebies, you cant complain!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is an excellent compliment to an existing clone army. It is a little dissapointing that the clone doesn't come with a blaster, as the only other promotional sets I had were the adventurers ones from the late 90s, and they came packed with accessories like guns and dynamite sticks, so a blaster would have been nice. But its still awesome!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You wont get much building exp out of this as its such a small model, but you can have some fun with this set if you have a few other star wars lego sets to do battle with!</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,3,5
