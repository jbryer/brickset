"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-12-29T12:12:30.827Z","Lake Patrol…","Yet another ‘free’ set and it fits perfectly with the other boats in my collection.   The police boat is very small and is made up of just 30 pieces and comes complete with a minifig captain.

The boat features a white hull and blue deck complete with high performance jet outdrive attached to the transom.   Above this is a frame arrangement to which blue lights are attached.   Attached to the forepeak is a sloping spray deflector complete with small ‘tinted’ windshield.   The cockpit area is small and accommodates the supplied minifig.   There is no steering wheel but two control levers, very futuristic.   There is also a bracket attached to the deck in which a handheld searchlight can be mounted.

The minifig is dressed in a standard-issue police uniform complete with white peak cap and wears sunglasses.

I think this craft would be a little on the small-side for offshore work, but I could imagine something like this patrolling a lake or inshore waters.   Either way, the set is great and cost very little, just the price of the newspaper and a trip to WHSmith to collect it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legofan3810","2010-07-05T11:12:36.35Z","On Patrol..","This set is fairly small. Don't get it if you don't have any police because it's not good on its own. <br><br>It's a pretty detailed set. It has lots of blue and white and pieces, lights and the cockpit contains to levers. There are lights on the top of the boat and on the side. It has an engine on the back and small windshield on the front. I like the boat a lot. 5/5<br><br>The figure is nice. He has a fairly common police man suit. He has sunglasses and has a very small smile. Too common in most sets. 4/5<br><br>Overall, a 4/5. I recommend this set to anyone that has a large police force.<br><br>L3810 <br>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,4
"meyerc13","2011-01-05T21:54:34.8Z","Great little patrol boat!","<p>When I first saw this boat, it reminded me of a rescue boat that I saw docked in the harbor of my home town.&nbsp; I researched it later and found out that it is a Sonic Jet FRJ-1250.&nbsp; While the lines of the boats aren't exactly the same, the low profile and function are clearly the same.&nbsp; So for those who think this doesn't fit into a LEGO City, I'd say it fits perfectly.&nbsp; On to my review.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>This is one of the small polybag sets that tend to show up in the check-out aisle of stores like Target in the US.&nbsp; The price on these sets is generally very reasonable, typically $4US.<br></li><li>The set includes a nice police officer minifig.&nbsp; In this case he is wearing gray gloves, a zip up jacket, and a white cap.&nbsp; I don't think he needs a helmet, but a ball cap might have looked better than the police cap.&nbsp; Easy enough to change.<br></li><li>The boat is small but it looks nice.&nbsp; Small winshield, searchlight, and even an engine.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>As I mentioned above, I may have changed the police cap to a white ball cap, but other than that I can't think of any changes I would make to this small set.<br></li></ul>
<p>This is one of the few polybag sets to stay intact in my son's LEGO City, whereas other sets like the 30010 Fire Chief have been stripped for parts.&nbsp; It is small, but a realistic craft and for the price it can't be beat.&nbsp; Definitely worth picking up if you spot it!&nbsp; If you change the colors I think it would also be great for your LEGO City Fire department or the collectible minifig Life Guard.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Pokemon_Trainer_Lucas","2020-05-22T18:50:33.687Z","A good little polybag LEGO set for kids","<p>As you would expect, polybag LEGO sets have a very small number of pieces, which makes them ideal for kids. This LEGO City Police Boat 30002 set has 30 pieces and is a fun little build that is ideal for expanding your LEGO City collection and encourages the imagination of children.</p>

<p>I highly recommend it, and would also like to add that it is good value for money as the price is cheap and your child will get enjoyment out of building the boat and then engaging in creative play.</p>
