"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-10-31T04:03:38.543Z","Excellent … for 45p …","This is the first Daily Mirror Lego Promotion Set which I have managed to get hold of (I live far from WHSmith’s and the local Toys ‘R’ Us is miles away too) but I was away recently and managed to get the paper and set almost straight away, the beauty of being in civilisation!

This is a great little set, it only consists of a few parts, the minifig is dressed in his blue overalls with red hat.   The roller is built up using two main Technic rods to which the drums are attached, these are secured with axles and securing nuts.   On top of this area, a plate secures the whole assembly onto which the steering wheel and seat are attached.   On the right-hand rod an amber beacon is mounted on a pole.   Very simple, yet very realistic. 

So for the price of the paper, 45p, an excellent little set, which would look great with the other construction sets in the range, and clever marketing by Lego to include on the reverse of the instruction booklet, the latest construction sets.

An easy 5 out of 5, but the newspaper was terrible…",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE BUILD </p>
<p>Fairly easy, for older lego builders, but under the age shown on the polypag...i don't no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PLAYABILITY</p>
<p>Good, very good. If you like the constuction line in&nbsp;city and have some sets to go with it then this sets for you! Even if you even only have last years&nbsp;daily mirror builder with diger. But, as with most sets, it's fairly pointless buying&nbsp;this one&nbsp;if it's by it's self.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PARTS</p>
<p>Good, even if its a space ship for space police or star wars, their always useful. Its held together by a small base plate (make that very, very small)!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE MONEY</p>
<p>For me,&nbsp;i sent away after&nbsp;getting all the barcodes printed on paper, and got them all&nbsp;for £8, but i dout their&nbsp; cheaper on ebay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OVERALL RATING</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'd give it a 5 brick's out of 5 brick's because, well, what's wrong with a good, cheap set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank's for reading&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,4
