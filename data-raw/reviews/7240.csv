This movie is good, with a sudden twist in the plot in the very end.
The beginning sequence with the Matoran is cool, I also like Mata Nuis battle with the Vorox, And when he saved Ackar from Strakk. It reveals the Agori traitor is Metus, not Berix, as I had assumed. Mata Nui kills Tuma, after he captured Kiina and Berix. They could have added a bit more to the end, though.

WARNING:HUGE SPOILERS!

I am not going to make a full summary, so click this link, then I will say what I thought of it:http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/BIONICLE:_The_Legend_Reborn.

     Earlier when I said abruptly ending parts, I specifically mean the part where Mata Nui, Ackar,and Kiina are in the underground lab of the great beings and are talking about the great beings and why Mata Nui feels like he has been there before. To those of you who are wondering why there was more than one ""Stronius"" those were just special forces Skrall. Tuma appears to die here, but he did not (see here:http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Tuma#Biography).
The way they made the Agori look the same from each tribe and all the Bone hunters look like Atakus was kind of weird though.


This is a very good movie which seems to be the most accurate movie since Mask of Light. I recommend this to any Bionicle fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Vrahno","2010-11-18T09:16:22.9Z","Mediocrity at its... most mediocre?","<p class=""MsoNormal"">The title sums it up nicely -- it's a lackluster DVD with a
mediocre movie. I mean, it is a direct-to-DVD title, but at least the original
BIONICLE trilogy managed to hide that fact somewhat. In the case of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The
Legend Reborn</span>, I don't think the makers were even trying. Do note, I will
make many comparisons to the original trilogy along the way.</p>

<p>Just for the record, the subject of my review is the Hungarian release of
the movie, which has English and Czech audio tracks, along with the
aforementioned native language, of course.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The movie:</p>

<p>(SPOILER alert!)</p>

<p>As you have possibly noticed, I wasn't quite impressed with it. At first, I
have to say I liked it, but that was because of all the anticipation, excitement and hype that gathered up in me prior to the release. Even then, I felt
something was wrong, but only after months did it finally become clear to me
just what the movie was lacking. I found faults in nearly every aspect of it.<br></p>

<p>The plot is a rather simple, yet interesting one. It's the story of the
""ex-God"" Mata Nui, who finds his spirit captured inside a mask and
stranded on an alien desert planet. While looking for a way back to his own
universe, which has fallen into the hands of evil, he unwittingly ends up
taking part in a local war. Reluctant to fight at the Glatorian's and Agori's
side at first, he witnesses the destruction the Skrall tribe and the Bone
Hunters caused, and has a change of heart. He decides to side with his newfound
(and first ever) friends to end the threat of the Skrall and Hunters once and
for all, all the while gathering clues that reveal his own origin and may even
help him reconquer his former universe. The importance of unity and friendship
is stressed throughout the movie.</p>

<p>Not a hard story to wrap your head around, but for some reason, they still
managed to screw up the execution. For one, the war against the Skrall and
their leader Tuma is mostly just hinted at, and we never get to see just what
kind of a threat they pose to the locals. True, they destroy and plunder a
village, but that happens off-screen. When they do fight on-screen, they are so
easily defeated that it's laughable. Every single bad guy that our heroes fight
is either a weakling or extremely dumb. The final fight between Mata Nui and
Tuma can be described with one word: anticlimatic. Even the ""epic""
clash that ensues afterwards is laughable -- the Skrall and Bone Hunters are
sent flying with one hit or kick, and the final blow which ends the battle is
so sudden, so out of the blue, that I felt cheated.</p>

<p>And we never once get to see all the combatants fighting. There was an army
of Agori, a number of Glatorian, and even battle chariots, but the scene only
focuses on our main heroes, making the struggle seem far less grand in its
scale than it really is.</p>

<p>But that's not the only fight scene I had problems with. In fact, all of
them are executed in an unprofessional manner. After each slash or hit, the
action stops for a moment, and the villains turn stiff for the heroes to finish
them off. The general cinematography also leaves a lot to be desired. The
""camera"" movements are so stiff and lifeless, that it drains the
scenes of almost every emotion. Instead of taking the viewer into the action, the
camera stays far away from it, as if the movie was a documentary. To be fair, though, there are several beautiful still shots, which show off nifty light effects and a scenic landscape (at least for a desert).<br></p>

<p>The characters themselves are somewhat shallow and uninteresting, but that
is to be expected when dealing with a large cast. Still, the main hero, Mata
Nui is well developed, and so are Ackar, Metus... even Kiina and Berix have
more than one layer to their personality. Yet I would still not call them
great characters. For one, we never get to know them all that well, and as the
story progresses, they lose some of the traits that made them interesting when
they were introduced, or are overshadowed by their annoying antics. Others,
such as Gresh serve next to no purpose, and only appear in the movie to promote
their toys.</p>

<p>The forced humor they've added into the scenes is another letdown. I wasn't
expecting a completely serious tone at all, what more, I would have hated a
serious and dark movie, but the supposed jokes are so flat and unneeded, they
actually detract from the experience. To make matters worse, they added stock
cartoon sound effects to them. Besides these, every sound you hear is a generic
stock sound.</p>

<p>The voice acting on the other hand is more of a mixed bag. The performances
are mostly solid, and most of the voices are spot-on. They only ones I disagree
with are Tuma (who sounds like a dumb brute), Berix (who talks incredibly fast
and has an annoying laugh), perhaps Kiina (who has become a ""popular""
target for angry fans because of her voice and her tendency to shout), some of the background voices, and
of course the Skrall and Bone Hunters. The latter characters have no spoken
dialog, instead they make strange gargling and squeaking sounds, as if they were
animals. This helps to make them even more unconvincing as villains.</p>

<p>Another sound-related aspect of the movie I still have to talk about: the
music. As so many other things in the movie, it is dull and barely memorable.
There are only a pair of tunes that stand out, everything else is extremely
plain, and doesn't grant the scenes any emotions. Whereas the original movies
had gorgeous musical scores, with stunningly well composed tracks that reached
far beyond the normal level of such toy films, this one lacks them, save for two or three tracks. The music
is supposed to carry the viewer more deeply into the movie, yet in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The
Legend Reborn</span>, it just seems to tag along with the events. On top of that,
it's so quiet that you can barely hear it in certain scenes. At times, I
actually had to mute the character dialog with my DVD player to discover that
there was music playing in the background. I genuinely liked the music that played during the opening scene, though. That was nice, but it would have been even nicer to hear the original BIONICLE ""theme"" that frequently popped up in the other movies.<br></p>

<p>Probably the biggest positive aspect of the movie is its visual appearance,
yet it is not without its faults. The animators put a lot of effort into the
outer look of the characters, their textures. The residents of Bara Magna all
look battered and scraped, whereas the newcomer Mata Nui has brightly shining
armor, which I felt was a nice touch. As the icing on the cake, spinning gears
and screws were added onto the characters to make them seem more
""alive"". The light reflecting off the varied surfaces also adds a new
layer to the visual appeal, as do the (mostly) well realized shadows.</p>

<p>But the positiveness of the graphics ends there. The motion-capture techniques
they used to bring the characters to life made their movements really awkward
in places. This is to be expected when they don't have human proportions.
Still, there are other problems which could have been avoided. The movements
are sometimes overdone, and the characters move around as if they were experiencing
a seizure. And the way they swing their weapons around is so unrealistic, I am
thinking the mocapped actors didn't actually hold anything in their hands. Huge
swords and massive shields are swung in every direction as if they were
weightless. The absence of the sense of weight effects the characters
themselves. One kick or punch sends heavily armored combatants flying, and they
pull off ridiculously unfeasible stunts. In full honesty, the movie really does
look like a bunch of toys flipping each other into the air.</p>

<p>As good as the characters look texture-wise, the backgrounds and landscapes
suffer in the same respect. The rocks are nothing more than oversized polygons,
the ground is bare and flat with repeating textures, and while some scenes make
them look actually good, in others, the clashing colors and the lack of
landmarks just make the scenery really ugly. Examples: the aerial shot of the village of Vulcanus, which is surrounded by plain, empty grayness with occasional rocks jutting out here and there. Then there is the shot of the Roxtus village, at the start of the final fight, where the surfaces are textured in such a way, that the rocks and mountains appear to be made out of plastic.<br></p>

<p>The character designs are questionable. On one hand, they closely resemble
their set counterparts, whereas the characters in the previous BIONICLE movies
were so redesigned, they sometimes looked almost nothing like the toys they
were supposed to advertise. On the other, almost every fault of the sets is
present on them. The designers filled in the holes and hollow body parts of the
main cast quite well, but these faults are all present on larger characters,
such as Tuma and the Rock Steeds. Even the hated red LEGO rods can be seen! I
also dislike the spinning screws. They can be really annoying with their
constant motion (though they stop at times due to faulty animation), and in my opinion they don't really add anything to the characters. If
anything, they make them resemble robots instead of living beings -- It has to be
said that the creators of the movie were functioning under the misconception
that these beings are machines. Why no one from LEGO bothered to tell them this
is not true is beyond me.</p>

<p>The movie is known as ending with a huge cliffhanger and a plot twist
(although to anyone that followed the storyline, it wasn't such a huge surprise).
A sequel was planned, but when LEGO scrapped the BIONICLE toyline, they stopped
working on it. On one hand, this was bad news -- since the plot was left
unresolved, and the movie simply doesn't work as a stand-alone feature. On the
other hand, it was good news -- perhaps they would have handled the sequel
badly. Another reason that played part in the sequel's cancellation (or so I have read) was that
the movie didn't gross as much money as fast as its creators wanted. This was a
result of a number of factors: The DVD content leaked to the net before it hit
the stores, so many people downloaded the movie illegally instead of paying for
it. Then, they aired the movie on TV not long after the DVD came out, which
meant that even more people could watch it for free. And of course there were
those video clips uploaded to the official LEGO website, which revealed far too
much of the movie, and turned off many people.</p>

<p>However, despite my harsh criticism, I wouldn't call <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Legend Reborn</span>
a horrible movie. It is average, and at times simply doesn't feel like a
BIONICLE movie, just a generic, kiddy cartoon. It is a shame, since the concept would have allowed for a far better movie.<br></p>

<p><b>The DVD and its other contents:</b></p>

<p>The cover art of the case is very nice, and it really makes clear who the
hero of the movie is. The sparks flying in the background and the Skrall
soldier lurking behind Mata Nui make the picture look more epic than the movie
itself, in my opinion. The back features Mata Nui locking swords with Tuma,
with the mask's landing site in the background (which if course never happened
in the story itself). The case included a small advertisement for the (back
then) current line of BIONICLE sets, the Glatorian Legends. I was somewhat
disappointed that it didn't come with a bigger brochure that featured more
sets, but at least it had something in it, other than the disc. Also, the
version sold here in Hungary didn't have any artwork on the inside, only blank
whiteness. The former DVD cases at least sported several promotional images and
short movie descriptions, as well as the DVD chapter titles. Aside from this,
the case has a very low-budget feel. Mine broke at several places just from
sheer usage.</p>

<p>Adding to this cheap feel is the DVD itself. I've discussed my
disappointment with the movie already. Initially, I figured if the feature film
is a so-so, maybe the DVD contents will make up for it. Was I wrong. We all
know the movie was only a direct-to-DVD product, and the disc does everything
to promote that notion. The menu is extremely dull. It features a still image
of a pre-rendered CG Mata Nui. No music accompanies it, whereas the previous
BIONICLE DVDs all had animated menus with not only music, but even sound
effects. Even looking at them was entertaining. The sub-menus are represented
by small icons, but when you select them, no text appears to indicate what they
are. As the main menu, they all have still images as backgrounds, but this
time, they're movie stills.</p>

<p>The chapter system is a mess. The movie is split into only 8 chapters, which
was in my opinion a bad decision, since this way, several separate events end
up on the same chapter, and you have to fast-forward or rewind a lot to go to
your desired scene.</p>

<p>The special features offer some interesting material, but they still feel
incomplete. Included are (thankfully) deleted scenes presented as animated
storyboards; an extended ending (basically a comical short cartoon); character
descriptions; and a music video for the band Cryoshell and a more
family-friendly version of their <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bye Bye Babylon</span> song.</p>

<p>The extended ending, titled <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Metus' Revenge</span>, I never got the point of.
Sure, it is a fun little animation, but I think the money and time they
invested into it would have been put to better use in the movie itself. They
could have made the final battle longer and more exciting, or added scenes of
character development. It adds nothing to the story, and actually makes fun of an event which is actually a tragic and disturbing turn of fate for a certain character.<br></p>

<p>The character descriptions are nothing to get thrilled about. While the
original BIONICLE trilogy presented these as explorers where you could
individually select the characters and hear a narration, as well as see 3D
spinnies or other movie images, the feature on this DVD only gives you a short,
silent slideshow. On top of that, the characters are represented by the
promotional CG renders of their toys, and some of the main characters are even
left out (probably because they no longer wanted to promote their figures).</p>

<p>The music video is decent, although it was available for download prior to
the DVD's release.</p>

<p>That's all the special features. It could have come with so much more. For
instance, a 'making of' presentation would have been nice. I would have been
really interested to see how the process went. At the very least, they could
have included the behind-the-scenes clips they had uploaded to the official LEGO
website.</p>

<p>Another useful feature would have been a short documentary of BIONICLE. If
you haven't been following the storyline up to this point, you would have a
hard time jumping into the experience. The movie is still easy to follow, but I
am sure most of the non-fans had trouble understanding the movie's introduction
scene, for example (then again, so did a number of fans, since the scene
heavily contradicts established canon). The character descriptions do give a
little insight into what's going on, but with their bare-bones presentation, I
wouldn't count on anyone actually giving them time to read through.</p>

<p>However that's just a suggestion, and the actual special features aren't
that useless or horrible. A serious flaw, on the other hand, is the terrible
audio changing system and the lack of subtitles. If you select 'English' at the
title screen, you won't get a menu. They're only available in Czech and
Hungarian! And if you want to change the language of the movie, you have to go
all the way back to the menu system and start the movie over, because you can't
do that in-movie. What an unprofessional design. And as mentioned, the DVD has
no subtitles at all. So for anyone that doesn't want to suffer through the
dubbing and doesn't know English either, this can be a huge disadvantage.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">I do not know whether the DVDs in other countries fared
better, however these are all legitimate complaints for the release that I got.</p>

<p><b>Final thoughts:</b></p>

<p>So is the movie any good? I would say it is, but it's very far from being
perfect. It is a very family-friendly story with many interesting concepts,
features a unique world rich in mysteries, and there are some characters children
can relate to. To those that want to see their action figures come to life and
interact and don't have too high expectations, it will surely offer an hour and a half of
entertainment. But for older fans or animation enthusiasts in general who
expected something more mature and maybe even thought-provoking, something that's suitable for a wider age-range, or simply something <span style=""font-style: italic;"">new</span>
and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">original</span>, something less clichéd, it is a lackluster, skippable movie. These people should read the
novelization instead, or the prequel and sequel stories -- those explain everything in detail and flesh out the characters far better than the confinements of such a movie ever could... and if you are into violence and gore, they provide examples of those as well.</p><p>The movie's concepts and storyline are good, but as said, the
execution leaves a lot to be desired, and coupled with the horribly minimalistic DVD, it all adds
up to a mediocre presentation in almost every respect.</p>
