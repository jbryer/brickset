Who Needs Some Kleenex.","I got this set yesterday thinking that with rain on the forecast I could have some fun with my first racers set since the pull-back engined cars graced the shelves. Meh.&nbsp;<div><b>The Pump:</b></div><div><b></b>The pump is three pieces, not counting the one built into the car. It comes with the red part stuck upside-down underneath the gray base piece. You have to unclick it from the bottom and then click it back on. It shoots air, just not very much. If it was twice as big it would work great. In reality, the red part is only 2 1/2 inches around. The guy stomping it on the box must wear, like, size fours. The car, when fired, doesn't go far or fast. I was disappointed. Pull-backs were so much better. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><div><div><b>The Car:</b></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Nice yellow color.&nbsp;</li><li>good wheels with cross axle holes instead of circular ones</li><li>Flame exhausts are sweet.</li><li>The bumper piece in the front. New? Old? I don't know, I don't care. It just looks good.</li><li>CHEAP! This thing is a bargain at thirteen bucks.</li></ul><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>The darn thing is wider in the front than the back. This is not good, and, to boot, there is really no decoration on the gray piece in which you stick the pump. This gives the car a front-heavy look.</li><li>The bull sticker on the hood is bad. It's honking up something awful through that nose ring. Talk about needing a tissue.</li><li>The spoiler falls off if you breathe on it wrong.</li></ul><div><b>Overall:</b> An iffy set. The only practical use for this is as a Christmas gift to that cousin who you don't really like. You'll save coinage, he'll be sad. That's a win-win situation if ever there was one.</div><ul><li><br></li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul></div></div></div></div>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4
