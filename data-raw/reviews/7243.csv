"nameless73","2010-03-16T23:13:08.763Z","Pneumatic racer","<p>This is a really nicely designed car with air-driven power.&nbsp; It's a bit of a shame to see the very pre-moulded rear hubcaps, rather than built ones.&nbsp; My set came with a two of the same wing pieces rather than a right and a left, which was disappointing. The air pump section has lots of potential&nbsp; for other usesand is much smaller than the previous pumps in the Mars Mission sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very playable set and an&nbsp;easy build (could be done by younger kids as there are only a few small pieces), though why is&nbsp;a police car lining up to drag race?</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,5,3
"modena","2010-12-03T10:14:25.893Z","Nice, but not much to play with.","This was OK for a present, and fun to build. The air-stomper is OK, but other than racing, there is not much you can do with it.<h4>Pros:</h4><div><ul><li>Nice colours!</li><li>Great Air-stomper!</li><li>Awesome wheels!</li><li>Nice stickers!</li></ul></div><h4>Cons:</h4><div><ul><li>Easy to build.</li><li>Fragile model.</li><li>Aerofoils fall off very easily.</li><li>Not much you can do with it.</li></ul></div><h4>Overall:</h4><p>This is a nice set if you have a friend and another car to race with, but on its own, it is a pretty boring set on its own. It is quite fragile to play with, and it isn't compatible with minifigs.</p><p>Overall, not a very great set to play with on its own.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,2,3
"Boidoh","2010-12-22T10:22:54.213Z","Small, Fragile and needs a rebuild!!","<p>This set is like all the other power racers with the air stomper but with different colors and stickers. This set is very fragile and small and not very good to play on its own, So I rebuilt it to be minifigure compatible and placed my police minifig in it. Mines came incomplete short of 2 pieces (that could have happened to anyone). I got it for 20 Belize Dollars which is 10 US Dollars, so i got a sweet deal..</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Neat Stickers 
<li>Nice Pieces 
<li>GREAT PRICE 
<li>Air Stomper 
<li>This may not count but the little pipe that the air stomper blows air into, if you take it off the car and aim it at like a LEGO wall its so powerfull on its own that it broke through it, also it made a REAL crack into my lego transport ferry. COOL!</li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Fragile 
<li>Not good to play on its own 
<li>Needs a rebuild (Like all the other power racers O_O)</li></ul>
<p>Its a nice set if you got some others that can go along with it or you need a police car for your city.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
