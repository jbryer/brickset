3/5: Very bare bones here as there are a few gaps throughout the set.&nbsp;
There are some nice slopes and the launcher is cool, though.<br><br>Playability
5/5: Even with its flaws it is an undoubtedly fun set to race.&nbsp; You
will not resist the urge to stomp on the launcher every now and then.<br><br>Value for money 5/5: A unique car with a special add-on, and a modest amount of pieces makes it well worth 12 U.S. dollars.<br><br>Overall
4/5: While it shows exceptional scores throughout the board, you will
have to spring a couple of bucks to complete the collection of 4 of
these racers to truly enjoy its quality.&nbsp; A great set for any LEGO fan.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,5
