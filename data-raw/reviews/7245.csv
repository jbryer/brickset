It's one of only three sets that have cheese-slopes in medium blue. With the other two being Tower Bridge and Hogwarts Express this is easily the cheapest way to get them.</p><p>It's a pity the 1x2/1x4 bracket doesn't come in orange or medium blue although the two white lines aren't that bad.</p>If only all Tiny Turbo's were this good... Buy one for the kids, buy one to display, then buy a few more for the medium blue and orange parts!<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
