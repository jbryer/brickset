I love the design, too. it reminds me of the Ford Fusion Hydrogen 999 land speed record car used in 2007 to prove that cars propelled by a gas different than straight unleaded fuel. Sleek, flat, and long, it looks just like it - except the Fusion 999 was lime, silver and white. this is purple. ;P

The white rims are something we haven't seen yet in Tiny Turbos, as is the rareish color of purple. (or maybe it's navy blue? heck, beats me.) lego says it's a stock car... but like I said, it reminds me of the salt flats racing automobiles. 

You get some pretty useful parts... the 2x4 slopes and... well that's about it. even I have a ton of those. The thing is, the color is useful, and that makes up for the lack of new parts. Here's on to what rocks, and what doesn't...

What rocks:

- Purple is awesome... I think I've mentioned purple enough in this review ;)
- Its design is very thought-out, as is with most Tiny Turbos - my favorite line
- Nice white rims i didn't have until now :]
- The lower grille is a pearly color, not matte chrome. I like, actually. 

What doesn't:

- Fudge - no new parts.
- It is a little too short in my opinion, muscle cars get pretty big. Oh well - this is modern muscle, so it should be slightly smaller 

I give this set an rating of five stars. It's excellent; it has everything you'd want in a Tiny Turbo - rare colors, good parts, and overall spiffyness. :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<ul>
    <li>All standard bricks</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Screen is too low profile, doesnt look right.</li>
    <li>Dark blue is much darker than I thought, not a fan.</li>
    <li>Wheels stick out more that my other racers (in the road packs) which looks odd.</li>
    <li>Front looks very wrong, badly designed.</li>
    <li>Back does too actually.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, this is a bad design. Next to the cars from something like 8197 or 8198 it looks substandard.</p>",TRUE,2,4,3,4,4

The wing on the back just looks silly and the front is just plain ugly and looks unfinished. I suspect the wide wheels were chosen because of part availability, not design.</p><p>Building is like most Tiny Turbo's; stack a few plates and stick a grille on a bracket at the front.</p><p>The main reason to buy this set is the dark blue pieces...<br></p>",TRUE,3,5,1,3,4
