"AddictedToStyrene","2010-06-14T01:27:22.89Z","Nice to have a tow truck to add to the race cars","<DIV>This is a cute little tow truck. It's good to see Tiny Turbos that are more than just racers. You can add to your Tiny Turbos scenes with this one - pull wrecked cars off the road and keep the race going!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The truck has slightly larger tyres than most Tiny Turbos cars; they have a thicker tread and would look good on a Minifig scale car. The front bumper is a white light saber, and the tow arm is a couple of technic pieces on a clicky hinge. There are eight stickers for the flame details on the front wheel arches, the 'Ed's Towing' logos on the side, metal plates on the back and the brake lights. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Most parts are red: 4 x 2 bricks, a variety of small flats, two different wheel arch pieces, and some black for the chassis and grey for the tow hook. When it is built, it looks like a big American pickup truck. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Good points: lots of nice&nbsp;details and it is a tow truck, not just another racer.</DIV>
<DIV>Bad points: it is another Tiny Turbo, so it's not for minifigs. </DIV>

Much more fun than 3177 Small Car.<br><br><h4>Parts:&nbsp; </h4>New tires and tow hook pieces for my collection.<br><br><h4>Playability:&nbsp; </h4>Great it you have another car. Pulls all of my Tiny Turbos easily, along with 3177 Small Car and 8402 Sports Car.<br><br><h4>Value for Money:&nbsp; </h4>I caught Turbo Tow on sale for AUD$8 and it was well worth it. It's sleek and fiery.<br><br><h4>Overall:&nbsp; </h4>Heavy haulage in miniature and the best tires I've seen on a LEGO vehicle since 8648 Buzz Saw.",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

It's a cool looking truck that could pass for a hummer at this scale. Nice stickers too; Ed's Tow Truck on the side and some flames on the bonnet.</p><p>Then there's the back... No back bumper and that Bionicle hook is just hideous.</p><p>The parts selection is poor for a Tiny Turbo; little more than standard plates. The only highlights are the tires and the new 1x3 tiles.</p><p>Playability is better than most of the Tiny Turbo's because with the hook it can do more than just drive.</p><p>A bit of a mixed bag then, but the kids won't mind.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,4,3
