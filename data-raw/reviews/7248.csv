The set is a Lego racers set from 2010 and is good. It includes a muscle car, a helicoptor, and a race track surface, there are a lot of stickers in the set, which takes up up half of the time you spend buuild on the set, which I gave it a 4.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Usually there's not much to say about Lego boxes but this series is different; there's the road that folds up to a container, then there's a cardboard sleeve and a yellow lid in the shape of a Tiny Turbo. The cardboard sleeve probably won't last but the lid fits the folded road.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Parts</span></p><p>There are no unusual parts in this set. There's the usual selection of plates, tiles, brackets and slopes to make the car and a handful of Technic parts to raise the road and make the tail of the chopper. This is the only set that has the skip in red.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fairly straight forward; there's a typical Tiny Turbo, a simple chopper and some accessories. The most challenging part is applying the 40-odd stickers. A lot of those go on the road but nearly everything else has a sticker as well. There are no markings on the road piece for the centre line stickers.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When complete you have a nice street scene with a good looking muscle car and a less impressive chopper. You also have a road section that doesn't want to stay in the position you bend it into. There's a lot to play with here with two vehicles, a skip, traffic cones and other attributes. Unfortunately the T-junction only has two sets of traffic lights and those two have no amber, only red and green. I would have happily traded in the no entry sign for the missing lights.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This set will give you a very playable bunch of items. While the fold out road section is an interesting concept I'm not sure it's that well executed. The sections don't want to stay flat. However that's unlikely to upset the target audience; my son enjoyed chasing the car with the helicopter. As a parts pack it may not be too interesting.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
