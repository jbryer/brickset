<ul>
    <li>Police car has great details and design especially with stickers attached, blue car not half bad either.</li>
    <li>Nice to have some fast cars - there arent nearly enough of them in these 'racers' sets.</li>
    <li>Road furniture is fun for play, and overall a good old fashioned cops and robbers play experience</li>
    <li>Great value especially considering the price of normal road pieces.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Road furniture is fragile once built</li>
    <li>Can be hard to keep the road lying flat (but a bit of bending back and to generally solves this)</li>
    <li>Blue car windscreen is a bit too low profile to be realistic.</li>
    <li>Very simple build - but it is what it is so you wouldnt expect that it'd be too comple</li>
</ul>
<p>Great cars. Think of these tiny racers sets as being more comparable to die-cast model cars in size and play experience, and with that in mind this is one of the better ones.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
