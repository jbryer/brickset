However, if you take away that huge quip that nukes a star off the face of my rating, this is actually a pretty cool set. I love the little race-utility truck, and as the back of the box art clearly depicts, you can place a green 1x2 tile with $100 print on it under the tonneau in the race-pickup's bed. This is a really cool playability function. (while Tiny Turbos are the pinnacle of awesomeness in lego to me, they usually don't have much more function than astounding looks, cuteness and rolling wheels, so this is a cool feature. ;D) 

The ""track"" isn't much of a track, as we've come to expect from the Tiny Turbo fold-out sets... just a sort of stubby T-shape. The ramp is the vertical bar on the T, and it is made into a ramp by technic pins poked into the technic holes, and two beams across for a very sturdy construction. there's also a tow-away zone warning sign and a typical american highway sign saying, ""DOCKS^"" and ""CITY>"", a very cool touch. and you know what? That sticker is on a 2x4 tile. WOOPEE! this part is AWESOME. It is extremely useful. unfortunately, you only get one in this set. If you're on a hunt for white 2x4 tiles, I'd buy Highway Chaos. It has three, I think. :P

Here's what rocks and what doesn't:

What rocks:

- A nice array of new parts, including a white 2x4 tile
- Some nice older parts too such as ten green 2x2 round plates for the barrels
- Eight more TT wheels... I have approximately a zillion of 'em but they come in useful, yanno?
- Sweet new design for the pickup. i lurvs me some that design. 

What doesn't:

- The scale of the flatbed. art thou kiddingst me!? It should be five studs wide.
- The race-pickup should be slightly longer, in my opinion. :]

my overall rating is 4 stars. Like I said, the scale of the flatbed kills off a star, but other than that this is a pretty good set. I got pretty much what I expected from this set - if you're a small-scale car builder looking for a cheapish set with a few rareish and brand-new 2010 part designs, I'd buy this.

Later alligator! :D",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Cons</h4>
- Truck rubbish compared to 8199. That said, that's a high bar, and its not half bad. Should have had 6 wheels though. <br>- Thin on street furniture.<br><br>I think the truck suits being a police truck better so left of the decals and added lights to the roof, and the colour scheme works well for this. <br><br>A good fun set especially for the money and when used with the other 3 like it (e.g. 8199)<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
