"IlovePowerMiners","2009-11-15T09:42:26.5Z","Combustix!","     The title is the rock monster in the set. I plan on keeping it short, so here goes:

Pros:
Trans. blue dome- I love this brick because they re- designed the old ""golf ball"" dome.
Rock monster- It is sweet because its head is trans. yellow, and his arms and print are black, vs. the old dark gray. 
Miner- I love the new ones because they have heatproof suits with Space Police 2 visors in silver, that is, without the antennae.
Play Features- For its size it has a lot of play features; it rolls, the miner's visor opens, the cockpit opens, and it has a dynamite launcher.

Cons:
Claw Digger crystal?- Instead of the yellow of the monster, they used the old Rock Raiders/ Claw Digger/ Underground Mining Station/ U know the rest colored crystal.

      I bought this at my local TRU which already has Atlantis/ Magma Mech/ whatnot. Overall I give it a 10 out of 5 it was exceptional and you should buy it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It comes with some cool new and rare pieces and very easy to build. Though it can't mine anything it can only defend this is rather disappointing and it looks as if none of the new sets of any mining ability at all. 

Though I do enjoy the new power miner and yellow rock monster (Though his crystal is greenish.) It is a good set and works well with the older power miners sets. I recommend ti for a quick build or a young child as it's pretty easy to build or repair.

"Takeshi","2010-01-06T16:42:36.5Z","Cool it Lava monsters!","This little set is great. The lava monsters had better run when the fire blaster on the hunt!

Pros:
  Dynamite Launcher
  Water Cannon- can't have too many trans-blue flames.
  New (I think) trans-blue dome. Doesn't have indents like the old ones.
  Silver suit and visor for Rex.
  COMBUSTIX! He has a trans yellow head which is spikier than the normal rock monster heads, and his torso is yellow with black colouring, rather than grey.
  The large wheels give it a good effect of all-terrain-ness. (yes, I know that isn't a word)

Cons:
  When you fold down the roll cage, there is is nothing to stop it, and will crush against the driver if the front hits something. This can be fixed by putting a 2x1 block on the bottom, or a 2x2 inverted slope block  and a 1x2 plate if you feel the need for fancy.
  Combustix is yellow and thus doesn't match the lime-yellow crystal he comes with. They should have either made combustix lime, or the crystal yellow.
  The back set of wheels is prone to falling off if the vehicle is hit too hard. this can be fixed by attaching a 1x1 block (or cylinder) to the axle, connecting it to the engine above.
  Like most power miners sets, it is a bit pricey for the amount of pieces that you are getting (12.99 here in Canada).


Overview:
This is a good set. I highly recommend it to power miners fans, and even those who are not. It has great playability, and comes with several pieces you don't find much in other series.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"arctrooper170","2010-02-27T17:53:52.903Z","Great start to the center of the earth journey!","<p>This is one of my favorite power miners sets so far. The Fire Blaster is a simple design but completly effective for tough and imaginative play. To continue with the Fire Blaster, it has oversized wheels for jumping over lava pools, water cannon to put out heating rocks and lava monsters, water tank to store your crystal and blue pieces to represent water, movable controls to further the playability, and opening cockpit to put in your power miner.</p>
<p>On to the Minifigures, Rex is newly fitted with heat-resistant armor (which includes printed torso and legs to show details of armor), and the same type of helmet as older power miners(to still give classic feel) but the color is now dull-chrome(how I put it) and has a new visor to protect his eyes. Combustix still has the classic body shape but is now almost completly translucent. The new translucent yellow color isn't used often and is a good switch. His head is also the same color but instead of being mostly rounded it has spikes on the top. The rest of him has scorched rock infused into the &quot;yellow&quot; lava, along with piercing red eyes.</p>
<p>Finally the accessories, This set includes a trans-green(doesn't match Combustix) crystal, a stick of dynamite on a flick-fire missle, water cannon, and removable water tank.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Combustix</li>

This set is supposed to use water against Combustix (Which I must say, is a really good lava monster). The new silver power miner is very detailed, and the visor is awesome! Pros and Cons:

Pros:
1. Price is pretty good (Considering playability and parts)
2. New minifigures!
3. Water tank and water-shooter both look cool

Cons:
1. When trying to put the Power Miner in the Fire Blaster, the top breaks off, and is hard to put back on
2. Front lights may fall, and are kind of awkward in position

Parents: This is a good starter set for the newer Power Miner fan, as well as and easy build. Holding down a few pieces to connect some may be neccessary, but still an easy build.

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2010-04-05T17:05:26.403Z","An Overall Great Set!","<p>Though my favorite franchise of LEGO's in recent years has been Space Police III, I have always thought that Power Miners wasn't a bad line either. This set is my first of the series, and I may get one or two more. I'll review this set in the same way I do for SPIII.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROS</p>
<p>One little fact about me was that the most memorable and beloved toyline LEGO has released is likely Rock Raiders. Obviously, Power Miners is heavily reminiscent of that ancient line, and is&nbsp;probably based off of it. One thing I immediately liked about Power Miners, both 2009 and 2010 sets was that a majority of the miner figures not only looked quite convincing but also possessed the same helmet that was introduced in Rock Raiders; to this day it remains my favorite Minifig headgear piece. Aside, I mean to say that the fact that this set includes a metallic silver version of one of those helmets and a great visor (that seeems to resemble visors seen in ""Ice Planet 2002"") is a definite plus, not to mention the new 2010 ""heat-resistant"" armor suits and a double sided head. The Minifigure is great. As far as the monsters of Power Miners,&nbsp;they are&nbsp;a bit more comical versions of the old Rock Monsters seen in Rock Raiders, but it is nevertheless quite fun and a cool looking character. The new lava monster in this set is very cool, mainly for his color and transparency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do like the new ""water tanks"" included in the new 2010 sets, and the devices used to fire the water. Its a great compliment to the new environment the Power Miners have entered. Also, the color scheme chosen by LEGO, being primarily lime green and orange, seems to fit quite well with the theme in my view. The main vehicle, bearing these colors, is generally well built and a cool looking little machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONS</p>
<p>There are just a few minor cons of this set. The first is the stickers. Usually I don't complain about stickers because up until now I haven't minded them at all. But in this rather small set, four stickers are included, two of which are painfully small. It is a hassle placing them where they're meant to go and it just angers me when I don't place them right. Also, the flick-launching ""dynamite"" isn't well designed. I have never minded the ""flick"" launching style&nbsp;that LEGO has employed in many of their more recent sets, gimmicky as it may be. First I should say that I have never liked how LEGO just smacks on a piece of dynamite onto a missle and calls it a ""dynamite-cannon."" But that's the least of my qualms. The placement of the missile launcher on the Fire Blaster is rather cramped, and it's difficult to get your finger in a good firing position, not to mention how annoyingly difficult it is to simply get the missile to launch out! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of all of that, the crystal that the Lava Monster Combustix comes with isn't transparent yellow like the Combustix monster is; it's transparent neon-green!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OVERALL</p>
<p>Despite my long list of cons, its mainly me rambling about the imperfections of this set. I'd say, if you want to get a LEGO set and have ten bucks to spare, buy this one. Even if you're new to Power Miners like I am, it's well worth it! </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

"BobaFett2","2011-01-13T15:07:51.147Z","The best way to get Lava Monsters","<p>This is the only Power Miners 2010 set I have, and it's the only one that I really think was worth getting.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box has a great scene where the Power Miner is blasting the Lava Monster underground. Need I say more?<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set is a bit low on parts-close to battle packs, yet it doesn't have 4 minifigures. However, there are many new parts that are of great value-the 4x4 round brick WITHOUT pin holes in the sides is a very useful part-no more ugly pinholes. There are some lime 1x2 vent slope bricks, a 4x4 transparent blue dome, a silver piece, some lime bricks, and a hose, among other parts. Sadly, there are stickers-the one on the TECHNIC piece started peeling off as soon as I attached it.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Power Miner is FANTASTIC. There is no other explanation. His silver armor works in so many things, and the helmet + mask looks fantastic. The Lava Monster is also superb-it looks less cartoony than the small Rock Monsters, and it's transparent yellow-but wait! The arms have the same method of attachment as those of minifigures, so you can trade arms! While it looks bad to give a Rock Monster a minifigure arm, a rock monster arm looks really cool on a minifigure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's not too complex-however, the use of TECHNIC parts and SNOT makes for a better build than many other sets with the same parts count.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The vehicle is great. It rolls around, launches dynamite, has a water hose, etc. There are a lot of playing possibilities, and you can do a lot combining this with other Power Miners sets. The water barrel is a bit awkward on top of those vents, and the vehicle has a rough look overall-but otherwise, it's a great set.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Anyone who wants to get a Lava Monster would benefit from getting this set. You get the thing best for fighting them, one of the best 2010 torsos, and a great number of other things. Its a bit expensive for it's part value, but it could be worse.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is another I picked up while on sale, I got it from London Drugs for 10.49$ (Or close to that price.) it was a good deal, much better than the 13.99$ price point TRU is selling it for. So I couldn't pass it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model is a nice little compact vehicle that the Power Miners use in their search for the mysterious energy crystals they are hunting on that alien world with the monster creatures. It was a fast build and easy to follow, with stickers for some of the details like all Power Miners sets. The vehicle has one gimmick, a flick fire TNT stick missile, I think it'd be dangerous launching dynamite at Rock Creatures. The blue dome piece and the blue fire/seaweed piece are two of my favorite pieces of this vehicle... If I'm not mistaken that dome piece is, if not the same, then at least similar to the Insectoids dome pieces back in the late 90's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures. It's the same basic Rock Monster body, but with a new transparent casting and a modified head piece, which is a bit more spikey (the top pieces stick out more.) than on the original 2009 Power Miners Rock Creatures. The new bodies/uniforms that the Power Miners are wearing are really great, with a silver tint to them they look like something designed to protect the wearer from intense heat (which you're bound to find the further down you dig into the center of any world.) and the new visor piece is a pleasent surprise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this set is a good little set for the LEGO Power Miners collections out there. The colors are still eye popping and draw you to them immediately on any display shelf, but that's not entirely a bad thing. I'm glad I finally got it, I have a feeling I might not be able to get every Power Miners set I want before they vanish from Retailers shelves, but I'm sure going to try.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"brickboyg","2011-02-09T08:08:11.25Z","Rock On Power Miners","My little brother got this set for me for my birthday, and i am very pleased with it.

Figures:

Gold Rock Monster: Great. Best rock monster so far, and no monster could really beat it, could they? Comes with a goldish yellow rock as well, which any rock monster can fit in their mouth. Rock Monster mouth is a bit delicate, and is very hard to find when you lose it, so keep it in a safe place. Mouth is fixed on by a hinge attached to the rock monster body. But the rock monsters have hands, which are hard to put weapons in.

Power Miner: Silver torso is great. Has a double sided face, which is covered by a silver helmet with a cool visor that covers his eyes. Legs have prints on them, similar to the prints on the torso.

Pros: 

1. As mentioned, the figures are great.

2. Window at front(no ""glass"" in window) opens and closes well, not touching anything doing so. I also like the lights fixed to the window thing.

3. The water tank lid is cool, but does not open(you have to take the lid off). It is fixed on top of a blue circular brick. There is a sticker on the circular block, which is awkward  to get on. But overall the water tank and lid look cool. 

4. The pipe attached to the front and back is good, but you cannot use it for many other things but this. For me the pipe does not feel very nice(wrinkly like a Shar Pei dog!!). I also like the water piece sticking out of the pipe(which is not real water)

5. The dynamite is a great piece. I like the red colour on the dynamite(which does not have any stickers on fortunately for me and any other people who do not have fingers made for putting small stickers on small things). It is one one of the best weapons ever made by lego, in my opinion. And it does fit in minifigures hands.

6. I love the grilled pieces on the sides of the ""Fire Blaster"". I also like the control sticks on each side of the figure when he sits in the cockpit/driving seat and the green grills on the side of the Fire Blaster- They're excellent.

Cons:

1. Stickers, for me there are too many.

2. For me the pipe does not feel very nice(wrinkly like a Shar Pei dog!!).

3. Rock Monster's hands are hard to put weapons in.

The Fire Blaster itself is a good small set, with some fantastic pieces for MOC'ing. Playability is quite nice for it's size, the set has some nice small features that give flexibility to play situations. As pieces and playability go, this is a fine set. as the prices value goes, I am not sure. My brother gave me this set, but from what I could tell from the local stores the value wasn't all that good. Nonetheless if you want a nice Power Miners set cheap then buy this set. Cheers!<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
