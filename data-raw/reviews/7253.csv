"washen","2009-11-22T17:52:11.887Z","Silver Minifig!","This set became available November 20, 2010 in some US ToysRUs stores. It features a new lava monster, a new silver version power miner, and a well-built, sturdy ""Magma Mech.""

The minifigs are definitely the highlight of this set! The power miner features a silver helmet taken from the original ""Rock Raiders,"" a visor of the same color, a set of armor in silver that can be seen in several of the ""Agents 2.0"" sets, and a light-gray body with chrome paint. The lava monster is just and updated model of the original with the torso and head being clear-orange and the arms and print black. It comes with a clear-orange crystal.

The ""Magma Mech"" itself is very well designed. It has a compartment well-suited for the minifigure to sit, a drill converted to look like a water cannon, a claw to grab the monster, and click-lock joints so it won't fall over. There are several new pieces in this set including a light-green 1X3 plate with no studs, a light-gray 2X4 with no studs, a clear-blue half-sphere, and two silver claw pieces.

Overall, this is a great set with a lot of great features! If for no other reason, pick one up for the silver pieces; but hurry...there might not be many left!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Nightshroud99","2009-12-03T13:57:19.857Z","Good Set","This is one of the new 2010 Power Miners sets which features the miners fighting a new enemy; the Lava Monsters. The set itself costs $20 and is worth the money in my opinion. With a new Power Miner with a silver body and repainted Agents armor in silver plus a new Lava monster this set is definately a good buy. I'll do a pros and cons system for this set.

PROS:
New Power Miner
New LAVA Monster (FIRAX)
Really cool color scheme
Mech is great to fight the Crystal King if you have that
Cool play feature; the claw extends

CONS: 
The set was a little smaller than I expected.
The Claw looks strange when not extended
Stickers (if you care about that)

Overall this is a good set and I recommend it. Also check out my YOUTUBE channel for LEGO video Reviews! http://www.youtube.com/user/Nightshroud99",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Takeshi","2010-01-18T16:10:58.483Z","WATER FIGHT!","The Magma Mech is definitely one of the best Power Miners sets that I've gotten. It has a whole host of new parts, and the playability is great. On to the Pros and Cons!

::Pros::
Pieces- As mentioned, there are quite a few new pieces. Included are: 2x4 and 1x3 flat plates, a single-stud 2x2 plate, large silver treads (two of them), blue drill piece, trans blue dome (not indented), and a few other pieces that haven't yet been seen in lime green.

Minifigs- this set has two really cool ones. you get Firax; the orange lava monster, and a power miner in silver body armor (previously only found in Agents 2.0 sets) and a silver helmet with visor.

Functions- As described on the back of the box, this set has an extending claw, rotating drill/water cannon, and (gasp!) the minifigure has an opening visor!

Modifications- I found out that if you add a few technic pieces and one of those big saw blades, you can turn the extending claw into an extending saw.

::Cons::

The Claw- When the claw extends, it does so at 90 degrees. This can cause difficulty when trying to grab lava monsters.

Missing pieces- There are some small gaps in the set. However, these are easily remedied by inserting 2x1 blocks, so it's not really a con at all.

Legs and Feet- The legs are quite stiff and unposeable, mainly because the knee joint doesn't bend. This can be fixed by replacing the connector with joints that actually move. The feet are hampered from moving too much by a set of wheel well pieces. This can be fixed by simply replacing them with different pieces.

::Overview::
This is a well designed set with very few flaws. It has a relatively sturdy construction, and great playability. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Power Miners, new pieces, or lime green.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"JBH75","2009-12-25T11:58:22.577Z","The Miners have struck lava!!","(Sigh), my final Christmas review. This Giant mech is an absolute excellent set. It features 2 new mini-figures, great functions, silver pieces, and a well planned design. I'm a little bit tired from posting reviews (and waking up at 4) so I'll be short and strong with my pros and cons

Pros:
Giant build (stands taller than Crystal Sweeper)
Brick built Cockpit
Extending Titanium Scissor Arm 
Water Blaster/Drill
360 degree shoulder articulation
Hip articulation, and foot pivoting
New silver Miner with silver ""welder"" visor, and heatproof armor (same as Lego Agents armor only Silver and no letter ""A"")
FIRAX lava monster, and orange crystal
Silver tread-links (I wish there were more)

Cons:
No knee articulation, but can be fixed (I fixed it with leg pieces that from the Atlantis monster crab's legs)
When extended, the titanium claw bends 90 degrees and ""knocks"" the lava monster out!

Overall, out of the five sets I received this Christmas, this one was the absolute best. So many options for playability, great function, new mini-figures, and all in time for Christmas! What more could you ask for?

"Kalhiki","2010-05-15T22:05:14.107Z","Possibly my favorite Lego set I have","I never was going to get any 'core of the earth' Power Miners sets. I just didn't really get it. With he release of the Crystal King and the Mining Base, it seemed Power Miners was over. But I read some reviews, and mechs just grow on me. Plus I like PM.<br>The building was rather entertaining. Building the front with all the small parts and the claw was all very fun. Now onto the minifigs<br>Firax- Apparently, this is Firox's cousin or something. I like the regular Rock Monster look over the lava monsters, but it's still good. The eyes of the lava monsters is probably the greatest downfall. The head has some spikes, which are supposed to represent flames. The black detailing is also cool having cracks in it.<br>Miner (Duke? I'm not good with names)- Oh my goodness this is probably my favorite minifig of all time and deserves a full-on inspection. The legs have a nice shiney metalic print on it.&nbsp;It also has a belt. The body has&nbsp;a silver shiny metallic print on it, and on both sides. On the chest it has a drill symbol. The head is the metal headplate guy. Not much to say. He also has some body armor with, you guessed it, the shiny metalic color. The helmet is the same PM helmet, only with a cool visor and in the previously mentioned color. Just all of the shininess of him makes him look awesome.<br>The parts are good. You get an orange crystal, and two of Tahu Mistika's blades.&nbsp; In addition to that, you get&nbsp;two silver tread pieces, a blue transparent dome, a blue drill, and a blue fire (water) piece. Plus there are the neat ball and socket bricks.<br>I rated playability a four mainly for poseability. Playability-wise, you have a neat extending arm, which doesn't really work. It would be nicer if the claws were sideways so it could grab the monster. Sadly, there is no gimmick to spinning the drill. The poseability suffers. There isn't much ankle movement which is bad when he doesn't have knees. There are also no elbows, but that's not too bad. I also don't like the ratchets. Sure they're stronger and hold more weight, but some areas are fragile and will pull apart when the arms are turned.<br>I'm also going to make a small side note. This mech, despite being larger, has many similarities to the Mine Mech.&nbsp;Both have claws, a digging tool (saw and drill), a light on the top, vent pieces on the toes, and no knees (though this is just a design issue). Interesting to say the least.<br>Yes, I'd pay $20 for this. I highly recommend getting it. In my opinion this should be one of the sets that's on the top of your list.",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Cyborg_Phloyd","2010-04-11T00:01:54.467Z","A great set to look at, not necessarily to play with","<p>My latest little phase in LEGO's franchises is the 2010 Power Miners sets, and since I live in the USA and this review is being made in mid-April, I can only grab the Fire Blaster and Magma Mech. This is my thoughts on the Magma Mech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROS</p>
<p>As in both my Power Miners review and my SPIII reviews, I do praise the minifigures. They really look impressive with their more detailed faces (often with dual expressions) back and front printed torsos and printed legs. In this set, the Power Miner figure is equipped with a ""LEGO Agents"" style suit of armor coated in brilliant metallic silver. This is covering the figure's excellent overall appearance. The face of the Miner doesn't appear to be any one of the four main Miners (Doc, Duke, Brains, Rex) but just another engineer of the team. Firax, the lava monster that comes in this set is a nice figure, though I always wished LEGO had made the Monsters look a little less comical. Alas, I love how LEGO always included a crystal of matching color to the monster, and this is true with Firax. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set has a wonderful appearance overall. I've never complained about stickers, though inconvenient they may be. The stickers on this set mesh perfectly with its color and design. I also have enjoyed the ""water tank"" features of the new sets, and especially in this one because of its placement on the back of the mech which looks so believable. Also, I think the use of a blue colored drill piece as a massive water cannon is perfect and truly appears its part. The monster grabbing claw, despite incoming cons about it, does look nice when its unfolded and held in place and the folding mechanisms do manage to work decently. The Miner figure also fits relatively easily inside of the cockpit, which opens easily and looks very spiffy with its metallic silver side plates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONS</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I do have a good number of cons on this set that I for one noticed. First, I was a little disappointed with the piece they used to represent the water coming out of the cannon; a tiny blue ""fire"" piece. Now this small piece looked just fine when used on the Fire Blaster's water gun, but proportionately on the Magma Mech it looks pitiful. I would've expected more of a ""blast"" of water from that large of a water cannon. For instance, the flame piece included on the back of Kranxx's hot-rod bike in the SPIII set ""Freeze Ray Frenzy"" in a blue color would've done a far better job on this set IMO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the legs which I must say looked quite manageable on the box's image are just terrible. Poseability is limited heavily because the legs have no ""knee"" joint in them. Also, the bottom portion of the legs can easily fall apart because of the weak securing pieces on the backs of them. However, I feel I should mention that because I saw that the feet were ball-jointed that that alone would compensate with all of the legs' flaws. I was wrong. It may have been able to achieve that if the leg thruster pieces on the back of the legs were removed or repositioned; they get in the way of the feet so frequently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The back of the cockpit turns out to be on the unstable side. True, that nice TECHNIC piece in the back does keep it in place most of the time, the part that attached to the cockpit often begins to slide off when you grab the mech by the cockpit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for the biggest con of the entire set; the monster-grabbing claw. First of all, the set obviously claims it to be used to grab and pick up the lava monsters, but that seemingly simple task is nearly impossible. It's a wonder if you can manage to pick up a monster, but it is a miracle if you can try and hold him in there whilst moving the Magma Mech. This is but the smaller flaw of the claw. The most annoying factor about it is how terribly loose it is. Tilt the arm down just a little and the claw flings open. Indeed, you must swing the arm back far in order to keep the arm from unintentionally unfolding. However I found a highly useful way of countering this. On the gray TECHNIC bar that the arm is based on top off, if you can replace the loose gray axles with stiff black and blue ones, you can make the claw only open when you want to open it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OVERALL</p>
<p>I hate to bash LEGO in any way, and this is true with this set. My advice to you; if you're a fan of Power Miners, this set is worth the money. If you aren't, maybe look for another twenty dollar set.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4

"Darthleapyous","2010-12-29T01:42:21.94Z","Truly amazing!","<p>This set is very nice. The minifigures are the highlight of the set. I really like the firax lava monster, it is transparent orange and has awesome new black rock arms. The miner is almost equally as&nbsp;awesome. It is one of the new silver armoured miners with a new visor piece. Unlike the Fire Blaster or the Lavatraz, the miner has an agents 2.0 armour piece. The magma mech is quite large, being as&nbsp;tall&nbsp;than the crystal king. The only bad thing about it is the legs, it can be a real pain in the neck standing it upright without it flopping down all the time.&nbsp; I have always loved the silver plates on the side of the cockpit, they are a really nice part of the set. Finally, we have the weapons. The scissor claw works quite well and i really like the blue drill piece. Even know it looks a bit silly, the blue fire piece is a nice little piece to have in your collection.</p>

<p>The Claw: It was a great thought. It snaps done hard but since it closes at a doneward angle, there is no way it can grab a small lava monster (or a regular rock monster).&nbsp; It is not useless though,&nbsp;it can still grab the Crystal King&nbsp;or Rock Throwing Monsters arms. I don't think the hinges are loose, they work just fine for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hose: Is so Awesome! It just looks so cool, and tank is also a very nice part.&nbsp; The water coming out of it some people think is too small, but I think it looks good with or with out a big water spray.</p>

<p>The Legs: They look good, but they have no knees.&nbsp;Kind of hard to play with with out the knees.&nbsp; They have cool rocket jets on the back and contain some neat pieces.</p>

"EtudeTheBadger","2010-07-14T17:30:37.16Z","A Hard Catch!","I managed to get this set at the LEGO Shop a few weeks ago, and despite the excitement surrounding the new Power Miners theme, I was disappointed with the Magma Mech.<br><p>That's the downer out of the way for now, so I'll get on. I opened this set when I got home and began to work on the Mech. It should be said that building the vehicle is an entertaining experience. I love the combination of chunky, older parts with an array of newer parts - it really makes for a great model. The high point is definitely the use of track parts as armour - what a concept! The figure in heatproof armor and Lava Monster Firax are also a great addition, as is the silver tube and the parts.</p><p>Unfotunately, the greatness is overshadowed by some detrimental cons. <br></p><p>First off, the legs are nearly immobile. There is no flexibility in the main parts of the legs apart from joints that attach the legs to the body of the Mech. This is a problem when moving it, as the legs manoevre in a clumsy fashion that is hard to play with. <br></p><p>Another huge problem is inherent in the way the tank is attached to the cockpit, and this is noticeable by way of the arms. If the arms are moved in any way, the back of the cockpit will come off. This is an elementary flaw that could have been detected in the early design stages, and really brings the model down. Lastly, the 'claw' function is awful. Using it is near to impossible unless the Mech is being held sideways, which is ridiculous, and the claws do not hold onto Firax that well.</p><p>It's really disheartening that LEGO makes such terrible mistakes, especially with a model that could so easily have been a classic. Oh, well. Better luck next time, eh?</p><p>If you really want this, it has some super accessories and figures.
