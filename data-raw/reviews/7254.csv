"EtudeTheBadger","2010-05-26T17:18:08.263Z","The Claws of The Machine","As a Power Miners enthusiast, I've been eagerly anticipating the release of the new Power Miners wave, and after a protracted period of waiting for my local Toys R Us to stock any of it, I gave up the waiting game and jetted off to my nearest LEGO Shop in Milton Keynes to grab some water-spewing machinery!<br><p>And this leads us neatly to the Claw Catcher, which I bought and built today.&nbsp;</p><p>Although not among those Power Miners vehicles with the ability to actually throw water (in fact, it's the only one not to have a tank and hose),&nbsp; it's a worthy piece of kit, and well worth my time (and yours!).</p><p>Let's open with the building, hey? The construction of the vehicle is <span style=""font-style: italic;"">hugely</span> entertaining, make no mistake! You get a good range of parts to build the Catcher's chassis, body and wheels, and while a lot of the parts aren't anything hugely new, they're well placed and make the model look <span style=""font-style: italic;"">brilliant</span>, along with the semi-new colour scheme. It's definitely fun to make. <br></p><p>When you're done with the build, the model does everything advertised - and with style! Grip that Infernox and lob him into the tank in the rear of the vehicle with those big claws! <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Wow</span>! Never thought it would work, but man, oh man, does it <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ever</span>! The accessories for the set are outstanding, too- another red Crystal and some tools along with - get this - a frying pan and a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">frankfurter</span>! Well... it's hot down there, and volcanic cooking <span style=""font-style: italic;"">does</span> hit the spot...</p><p>Such a cool model will have downfalls, however, and that sombre point leads us to the Cons. First off, building is tricky in the initial stages, when the chassis is going together; lining everything up is a challenge, and will likely tax younger builders. Secondly, the claws flap about while building, which is a little annoying. And finally, to perform the monster-grabbing stunt well, you have to hold onto the main vehicle, which is a little difficult and unwieldy.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, I'd disregard the Cons, personally. This is a brilliant set and perfect for Power Miners initiates and fans alike! I recommend to everyone!<br></p><p>-maaboo35<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"j013","2010-07-05T16:47:25.4Z","the best set ever!","The claw catcher&nbsp;is my absolute favorite power miners set and thats coming from a guy with all 18 sets. This set contans 259 pieces, set number 8190, ages 8-14. The 2 minifigures included in this set are brains (in a silver suit with silver agents armore) and inferox (the red lava monster) exclusive to the set. The vechicle itself is huge! It is 1ft.&nbsp;in length&nbsp;when the claws are closed, 6 in. wide and 4 in. tall. The claw catcher has beautifully detailed engines, 6 accessories (a shovel, pick ax, dynamite, binoculars, pan, and a sausage!) and a very funny sticker on the back that says ""danger flying monsters"". Now on to&nbsp;the main function the claw, there is a handle on the back which is connected to the claws. So when the handle is pulled so are the claws thus picking up inferox and throwing him into the hot&nbsp;water chamber on the back! The claws work on any minifigure and the hot water chamber on the back can hold up to 4 monsters. This is a great set i recommend it to anyone especially a power miners fan!&nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"agentminky","2010-08-11T03:46:40.67Z","Lava suits, Lava Monsters, Claws and... Frankfurters?","The Claw Catcher is the Set that brought me back to Lego after a 2 year absence. In my opinion, sets and themes had been steadily declining for a few years, and this was the set that made me take another look at Lego. Although I still think a lot of themes, like Dino attack / Dino 2010 were bad, I'm a big fan of many of the current themes, such as Power Miners and Atlantis, and a big fan of Lego as a whole.<div><br></div><div>So, without further ado, the review of what is possibly my favourite Lego Set:<div><br></div><div><br></div><h4><b>The Claw Catcher</b></h4><div><br></div><div><br><div><br></div><h4><b>The Build</b></h4><div><br></div><div>Not the best build ever, but still great fun. It was good working with pieces that I hadn't (or had rarely) seen before, and the claw catching function (more on that later), although slightly more difficult than the rest of the build, was very satisfying when finished. It might be a bit difficult with younger Lego Builders, but more experienced or older Builders should have no problem. Other than that, I haven't really got much to say in this section: generally, an average build with a few fun bits.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h4><b>Parts</b></h4><div><br></div><div>Lots of rare and unusual parts and colours here. The pieces used in making the mechanism for the ""claws"" of the vehicle would probably be really useful in other mechanisms, and the claws themselves might be good for bionicle / Hero Factory fans. You get eight standard power miners wheels (yes, eight: they fit together to make thicker wheels), some unusual, large transparent blue pieces for the compartment where the Lava Monsters you throw land, and various other useful pieces, such as turbines and several engine parts.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h4><b>Minifigs</b></h4><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div>Brilliant minifigs here, in my opinion. Brains looks great in his Lava suit (while Brains in a Lava suit could be constructed from other Minifigure parts, his Anti-Lava armour can only be found in this set and the Mine Mech, and the Minifig as a whole can only be found here). He comes with many accessories, such as a pickaxe; dynamite; a spade, and, of course, a saucepan and frankfurter, which are infinitely useful underground. Really! Here are some examples:</div><div><br></div><div>Hungry underground, but haven't bought a cooker? Don't worry! Use Lavatech's new Lavatech saucepan and frankfurter combined with the natural heat of the lava, for a delicious, crisp Lunch! Alternatively, Lava Monsters giving you trouble? Throw the frankfurter to distract them, and hit them on the head with the saucepan!&nbsp;</div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><br></div></span></b></div></span></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; "">And so on.</div></span></b></div></span></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><br></div></span></b></div></span></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; "">Finally, the set's Lava monster, Infernox has given me no end of fun!

Surprisingly, the Claw Catcher's catching mechanism works perfectly, and is a jot to use! The expression that comes to mind whenever I use it is ""Slam Dunk!"", as Infernox (or, indeed, anything about his size) almost always lands successfully in the containment pod with a satisfying sound. This does bring me to a small warning, as I think some people would expect the containment Pod's hatch to open automatically when you use the set's flinging function. It doesn't, and you need to open the pod first. Not a major thing, just something to remember. Also, apart from this mechanism, the set doesn't have any others built in. That's OK, though, because this is such a great function, and it's easy to be creative during play with the Power Miners theme.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><h4><b><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><div style=""display: inline !important; ""><b>Conclusion</b></div></div></b></div></b></div></b></div></b></div></div></b></div></b></div></b></h4><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><div>A fantastic set, which I would highly recommend. As Lego is becoming increasingly more expensive, the claw catcher's Price-Per-Pice ratio seems only average.

"FanofLego","2011-04-16T13:52:59.197Z","Absolutely amazing claw function","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I first saw this set on&nbsp;Brickset I thought it looked great. But it wasn't on my christmas list. I was really happy when I got it, but when I opened it and saw the pieces I was even more excited, and finally when I saw the claw function work I was in awe. You can play with it for hours. It's absolutely amazing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First lets start with the two good minifigures. Although Combustix is my favourite lava monster, Infernox is super excellent as well. I just love lava and rock monsters. I think they look excellent. The first lava monster I got was the Firax keychain and it's mouth didn't open. Now Brains is awesome. I already had some of those excellent metal looking helmets they wear when I got Lavatraz (2010) and Fireblaster (2010) but some more doesn't hurt at all. I also like brain's metal armor. Brains is a sweet character too. He looks&nbsp;good and I like his eye. I wanted him ever since I saw&nbsp;the Mine Mech (2009).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pieces are quite excellent. I like the water tank and the pieces that are used as claws. There are some good exhaust pipes and engine pieces such as the propellers&nbsp;and those two rods by the cab that they used for Lego Dinosaur tails (2001). The pan and the hot dog are good as well as the eight giant wheels that you can use for your own creations. They also can be used to build towers or anything else. They're just good pieces.</p>
