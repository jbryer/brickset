"Schismtp","2009-12-19T14:56:47.2Z","5864 Creator","  I picked this up at my local LIC.  The container was still factory sealed, but I opened it up to find no polybag, just the loose parts, instructions, and a promo card.
  Other than that, it's a great little set to go with the previous Mini-Creators.  Uses the new stud-on-side 1x1s, but mostly pre-released parts.  It's bigger than the container, so it needs to be broken up for storage.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kaboomlegoman","2010-01-03T17:43:08.827Z","okay...","This set is okay, but really, it does have some flaws. First, the rotors don't spin good, about as well as the pathetic builder. Also, the cockpit isn't like the mini Neptune carrier's armor, as in it it is put like a puzzle piece at the very end of the slope. The back propeller spins even worse than both. The lights on the side are a good add, and blue and white is my favorite color combination( I just adore Gelu and Strakk) Overall, nice set and might wanna pick it up while you're at it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"diverLanceSpears","2010-05-25T22:26:01.2Z","Cool little Copter","&nbsp;&nbsp; To start with, this set is small, and there's not much that you can do with it. The propellers work pretty well, but the landing skids are somewhat ungraceful. The container is nice, and I use it for storing Lego minifigures when not using them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not built the other alternative models, but if I do, I will review them as well. Overall, a four, because, as previously stated, there's not much that you can do with it. I built a remote control with a radio, lever, and a 'dot', so now it is a remote-controlled news copter. Booyah!<br>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
"AETerry","2011-11-07T22:39:35.873Z","Mini Helicopter Review","This is the second Creator set that I've gotten and the first of the small $5-6 dollar sets picked up. So value wise, the variety and piece count is pretty good. Especially as I had in mind getting this set for some of it's parts.<br><br>Most of the small Creator sets are variations of cars and if I can't fit a minifigure in them I'm not really interested in getting the set or find them redundant. This being a helicopter was certainly different enough and sparked my interest once I looked over what pieces were in it.<br><br>It's not a bad little kit if someone wants to just build the models of vehicles and then have instructions for building alternative models. In the long run I can't see getting very many as I prefer the minifigure scale sized sets.<br>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,4
"Akceptor","2011-03-02T15:18:28.097Z","One missing part ^(","<p>One part is missing (main rotor rotating part). At the all, good set.</p><p>I've build an alternative model (airplane) - and it's nice, but without missing part can't build helicopter (main model).</p>",TRUE,4,2,3,4,4
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-12-11T20:08:24.17Z","Three in One, for extra fun!","<p>Mini Helicopter is one of those sets that doesn't look like it has anything going for it. This however, is a false statement. The three models you can build are pretty nifty lookin', so not a bad value.</p><p>Firstly, the box. Oh, the box- it's a great one. Unlike the usual boxing, this one is a container, so you can put the pieces in when you're done. I'd say the container can be one of the best reasons to buy this set. The front shows a close up of the Helicopter with the small Seaplane and Tugboats in the corner, while the back shows all three models at the same size on the back.</p><p>As for the actual models, all of them are built pretty well. The Seaplane is pretty good, but I have one complaint, and that's the back. I don't like how they did the tail. I find it bulky and think a tile would have worked better than a brick. Despite this, however, the Seaplane remains my favorite, as the color scheme and the design is great through out the rest of the model.</p><p>The main model, as it is the showcase of the boxart, is the Helicopter. The helicopter is a pretty good rendition. It's got the things that make a helicopter a helicopter, and the color scheme is&nbsp;distributed&nbsp;very well. A good model, no complaints.</p><p>As for the third model, the Tugboat, I'm not too big a fan of, but it is a pretty good version of the real thing, even if it looks a tad funny. This build is rather simple however.</p>

<p>5864 is a pretty good little set for its low price. If you're looking for a quick, fun, build at a low price, this is the set you want.</p>",TRUE,4,3,5,4,5
