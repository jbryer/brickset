"Schismtp","2009-12-19T14:56:57.577Z","5865 Creator","  I picked this up at my local LIC.  The container was still factory sealed, but I opened it up to find no polybag, just the loose parts, instructions, and a promo card.
  Other than that, it's a great little set to go with the previous Mini-Creators.  Uses the new stud-on-side 1x1s, but mostly pre-released parts.  Fits whole into the container.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kaboomlegoman","2010-01-03T17:48:10.34Z","better than helicopter","This set is very good. Compared to the helicopter, It makes it look like a ... thing. The windshield is good, and it can have the dumper bend down. Well, not much else I can say, because there is very limited playablity. Overall, good set and you should get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Three cute green cars for Â£4,50.</p><p>Let's start with the bad news: the racing car doesn't do it for me. It just doesn't seem to know what sort of racecar it wants to be.</p><p>Next up is a little SUV-type car. Mirrors, lights and a chunky bumper and grill: this is as good as it gets on two square inches.</p><p>The star of the show is a dumper truck. By clever use of parts the proportions are spot on and the tipper actually works.</p><p>This is a great little set: an interesting bunch of parts and some inspiring models for under a fiver. Pick one up for the kids next time you spot one at the checkout.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5
"SafePit","2010-12-29T21:22:18.25Z","Great small set with lots of fun potential","I really enjoyed the look of this set when I first saw it. The truck is well proportioned and makes good use of pieces with interesting builds. The set actually has three instructions in it that are just as fun to build as the first. When I saw this set in the store, I had to have it! I picked this set up on sale for $6, which isn't too bad (about 10 cents a piece). The piece mix is&nbsp;surprisingly varied making it great stand alone set. I still think this is the best of the series.",FALSE,5,4,4,5,5
"Wom","2016-01-13T10:35:05.593Z","The smallest big dumper truck you will ever see","<p>This set is shipped in canister type of packaging which I personally don&#39;t like. A big part of the Lego experience is the un-boxing and with these cannisters this feels a bit unsatisfactory. The parts are not shipped in a polybag and are loose in the package next to the instructions. Nowadays Lego is using boxes again for these small sets, much to my personal preference!</p>

<p>Out of the three sets you can build the dumper truck is the one which has the best looks. The proportions give it a bit of a comic feel, but it also reminds me of the big trucks used at mining sites. The dumper itself can be moved up and down so playability-wise the truck is also the strongest model of the three.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The SUV-model doesn&#39;t look too bad. Although being small in size the model has the look and feel of a SUV, with the chunky bumper and the relative large grill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The weakest one is the racing car. It just looks a bit off, as you cannot really compare it with any real life cars around. The small size of these models make it hard, but the other two models surely did a better job on this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With only 60 parts included Lego still managed to offer some nice parts not commonly seen in other sets. Several of the grey 1x1 pieces I have not come across a lot, so that is a bonus if you are into the collection of certain pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking all things into account this is a great small set which I wished came in another form of packaging. Other than that there is no reason not to buy this set. Bricklink prices are lower than when I bought this set, so what are you waiting for?&nbsp;</p>
