Those are the dominant colors throughout the set, as well as a smattering of black and dark blue/gray pieces. There are also two of the relatively new 1x1 brick w/one stud on the side, which is a popular piece for SNOT techniques. A red 2x2 curved piece with two studs on top and two dark blue/gray cylinders (used as astromech droid bodies in Star Wars sets) add useful pieces. Additionally, a translucent smoke colored windscreen and two 1x2 trans smoke bricks round out what essentially amounts to a solid parts pack.</div><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#AD1808"" size=""4""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;""><b><br></b></span></font></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-weight: bold; "">Build</span></div><div>The primary model, the 'Rescue Helicopter' is rather solid, with some interesting SNOT techniques used in the nose assembly. There are some questionable parts, like the use of the 2x10 red plate instead of a 1x10 brick for the tail assembly, though this is probably due in part to necessary uses in the two alternate models. The engine and rotors look cool, using the R2-D2 body cylinders and 1x2 slopes with grating to nice effect. The only weak point is the lack of any landing gear and the fact that the rear curve slopes that WOULD house the landing gear can fall off easily. That said, the size makes it very swooshable.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the tertiary model, the speedboat, is much stronger than the bi-plane and almost on-par with the helicopter model itself, I will review that next. This is a point in this sets' favor, as the primary model is generally much better than the other two. In this case, only the biplane suffers. The boat is comprised of two 'pontoon' sections, a center passenger section and a HUGE engine in the back. The engine is highly detailed for the parts available, and the shape of the boat is over-all pleasant.</div><div><br></div><div>The secondary model, the bi-plane, is the weakest of the bunch. The scale is confusing, with rather small wings and a very chunky fuselage. The use of the large windscreen also further confuses the issue, making it look to be almost minifigure scale, but at that size it would look comical, like some of the cheaper biplane sets from the 'Adventurers' line.</div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>Since most Creator sets are meant to act as parts packs, for your money, you can't go wrong with the parts you get in this set. The piece/dollar ratio is very good (well below the $0.10/piece that most people say is the 'golden ratio' of LEGO pricing). While red and yellow are common colors (especially, it seems, among Creator sets in 2009) the parts you get in those colors are extremely useful. The addition of useful SNOT bricks and brackets makes this one a steal.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,2,5

You can surely build the 3 models, but there is not the realism you can find even in smaller sets, like #4837 or #4915, or medium ones like #5867.</div><div><br></div><div>The models look like an helicopter, a biplane, etc. But there are a little bit ""square"". They seem to lack of original pieces. Moreover, there is no landing gear. Maybe this is the point.</div><div><br></div><div>Even when I tried to use those pieces to build MOC, I just could not find the inspiration. The fun was not there.</div><div><br></div><div>Fortunately, the Creator series provides many other great sets!</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,2,3
"Duq","2011-01-12T19:13:33.637Z","Not Creators finest moment but a great buy","<p>I picked this set up because I liked the looks of the helicopter and because it was on offer. After building all three models I'm a bit disappointed.</p><p>First I built the boat. Like the third model in some other Creator sets it looks like it was an afterthought; the parts for the set had already been decided, they already had a chopper and a plane and what else could you build without wheels? So we have a boat that's a bit of a catamaran, but not quite. It's a bit racer and a bit lifeboat.</p><p>Next I built the biplane. It's second in the booklets so I expected it to be the second best model but it's an even worse botch-job than the boat. The colours are all over the place, the proportions beyond comical and it has no landing gear. It's possibly the worst airplane design in a Lego set that I know.</p><p>So on to the star of the show, the rescue helicopter. Here the colours work and the proportions are spot on. A little snot in the nose (pardon the pun) to create a nice shape and some nice touches like the pulley for the rescue cable. It's not minifig scale but then Creator sets aren't. That's why it's Creator and not City. But... it's got no landing gear.</p><p>As mentioned in other reviews, the great thing about this set is all the great parts: cheese slopes, cheese graters, 1x1 bricks with a stud on the side, curved slopes and those dark grey cylinders.</p><p>So great value for money, great parts selection (though it really needs three single wheels for landing gear), but two of the three models are disappointing.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,5
"jamal_lts","2011-01-10T17:40:58.877Z","Color me Black  and call me Air wolf!","<p>The design resembles that of the helicopter from the TV series Air wolf!</p>
<p>Its  not in mini fig scale in which it is slightly smaller. However for its  size, it has a number of moving functions -&gt; the blades, rotor, the  cargo door. If only they made it larger, i can include this into my  coast guard vehicle rescue collection.</p>
<p>Only draw back is that the  blades don't spin well if you turn it too fast. Its wobbly causing it  to vibrate around the pivot point and resist its spin action. </p>
<p>Nice design considering the number of pieces used. </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Alternate Models</span></p>
<p>I only made the speed boat which looks worthwhile. The bi-plane simply  doesn't look appealing. Nothing special about it though. Just a simple  model which looks nice on a desk. You can swoosh it around while waiting  for the desktop to load. </p>
<p>Add a large fan at the back and&nbsp; you can make it look like a swamp speeder in mini fig scale.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,3
"Grogs","2011-03-19T17:31:47.73Z","Kind of dropped the ball on this one","<p>I think LEGO dropped the ball on this set. &nbsp;all three models look a bit odd once built, and there was a couple of things they could have included to make it better...</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>a lot of fun parts and the colors are awesome! its been a while since i've seen those old school rotors in a set :)</div><div><br></div><div>but would it have killed LEGO to put a couple of wheels in for landing gear for the biplane and helicopter?</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I felt that all 3 models looked odd, or were a bit off...&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>the helicopter reminded me of a&nbsp;<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; "">Sikorsky S92. &nbsp;P</span>roportionally looks a bit narrow for its length, but the detail around the engines i thought was impressive. &nbsp;The cargo door was a nice touch and added some&nbsp;interest&nbsp;to the rear (which i always seem to have a problem with when building my own planes and helicopters)</p><p><br></p><p>The Bi-Plane was a disappointment. &nbsp;a couple more plates for the upper wing (most Bi-planes upper wing has more surface area than the lower!!) and some wheels would have made this guy the A-model. &nbsp;the windscreen was a bit odd looking, but may have looked better with the appropriate upper wing.</p><p><br></p><p>The boat (as with the other models) looked a bit off. &nbsp;the engine looked a bit oversized (but nice detail!) and the windscreen was HUGE for a boat that size.</p>

"dougts","2011-05-16T17:17:44.66Z","Meh.  Nothing outstanding here","<p>Picked up two of these last Christmas - 1 for each of my daughter. &nbsp;Have done all three builds, with not much to say about them good or bad. &nbsp;Although all 3 are essentially minifig scale, they don't really fit minifigs without&nbsp;modification. &nbsp;I realize as a Creator set, it isn't supposed to - but if you are going to be that close scale-wise, may as well make it work. &nbsp;None of the builds feature much in the way of playability, and they&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;are fragile and fall apart fairly easily. &nbsp;Not really exciting as display pieces either.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Several good parts included for doing MOCs</li><li>Good color schemesâ€¦</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Doesn't quite fit minifigures</li><li>Fragile</li><li>Limited playability/usability.</li></ul>
<p>Okay set if you want to pick it up for parts, or get it on a sale or something. &nbsp;Nothing much remarkable about any of the models.</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,2
"Legolijntje","2013-01-07T09:48:58.677Z","Not the best Creator ever, but good enough","<p>I got this set a few weeks ago&nbsp; and I like its looks, but there are some less good things to point out...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Nothing to special to note here. Normal (oversized) box, clear instructions for the A, B and C model.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>A relatively good selection of parts: some nice curved slopes, the rotors and of course bricks: they're always useful.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was also average. It's just a normal build from bottom to top.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The looks are quite good for such a small model. The nose looks a bit weird though.</p><p>There's one huge disadvantage: the model is very unstable and the yellow curved slopes 1x3 at the bottom come off very often when played with. That's the main reason playabilty is a less.</p><p>The rotors are also turning&nbsp;very smooth.</p><p>It's also very anoying that a minifigure can't fit in there. I know; it's creator, but still. A little bigger and it was able to carry a minifg.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all it's a good set if you can get it in the sale. Don't expect too much of it though. There's 1 word to descripe this set: average.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,3
