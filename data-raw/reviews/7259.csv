"Lego_Guru","2009-12-23T21:39:59.047Z","An Awesome 3 in1 Set","First of all, the set itself consists of three different vehicles. A sports car (which is 
obvious from the picture), an offroad SUV, and a gokart. It also contains two new pieces: a 2 by 4 tile (as you can see in the picture on the left side door) and a new angle piece for the rear lights (where the vertical stud, instead of being set back into the brick, is not).

The Sportscar: is insanely cool and no doubt the best car in the set. it has four opening doors; two on the sides, hood, and trunk. The car is red with white racing stripes and has a window in the trunk so you can see the engine. The dashboard is tan and the seats are light blue. The hood is a nice touch and very snug when closed. the only problem I have had with this car is that the trunk does not stay open because of the hinge system.

The Offroad SUV: is good but don't have your heart set on it. There is one problem: the white stripe running across the the sides of the back of the car are uneven, one side consists of five pieces and the other side consists of one piece but other than that it is good. 

The Gokart: is a larger scale model but is still a great vehicle and is good for display.

Overall: a very good set with very little problems and is also a great deal since its only twenty American dollars and has 278 pieces.

You can create a go-kart, an SUV and the main car.

I started with the SUV as it looked interesting enough. It was a nice build, took about 30 minutes and created a decent model. This was on a similar size to the yellow/ green cars and compliments them well. Quite a few bits were left over.
The doors sort of open but do not fit too well. The bonnet is hinged but will not open. The boot is fixed which was a shame.

Second was the main car. There are lots of steps and the build took about an hour with a cup of tea. Another enjoyable build and the completed car looks great. It is on a larger scale than the green/ yellow cars being 10 studs wide instead of 8 and 5 studs longer too. It does make quite a bit of difference and it is a shame that they are not all similar.

Anyway, it has working doors, front boot/ bonnet area and a transparent lifting engine bay. The engine is a nice touch lacking in other models, but the bay door is hinged on two pins instead of a clasp like the doors. This makes it stay closed only due to gravity and it flaps open. A shame. The rear spoiler can tilt.

The red bricks make a nice difference, but im not sure if the two white stripes running te length of the car work. It would be better down the centre 'dodge viper' style but it cannot be changed.

Overall a good set, twice the price of the older models but one i can still definitely recommend.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Sky_guardian","2011-03-16T18:07:50.63Z","Kind of ashamed of creator...","To start off i think this is a great set with lots of potential, but...well lets just say the designers skip a few things.<div><br></div><div>Overall rating: 4/5 Because there are quite a few mistakes on this car (i'll explain later)</div><div>Building&nbsp;experience: 5/5 It would be rare for a creator set to not have good parts, and colors.</div><div>Parts: 5/5 some nice new pieces in this set.</div><div>Playability:2/5 not much to do with this car other than look at it.</div><div>Value: No&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;set is worth what it costs, but i still buy them anyway.</div><div><br></div><div>A few problems with this set is that the design could be better. For example, look at the door. &nbsp;It has a smooth piece on the bottom but nothing on the top! I found that adding a 1-by-4 flat tile made it look sleeker. &nbsp;Another problem is the front has an&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp;rise where the tiles intersect. &nbsp;This makes it look very unrealistic from the front. &nbsp;I can't really explain how to fix this but if you take off the tile under the hood and don't close it all the way it looks amazing. &nbsp;Now look just in front of the mirrors (or over the front tires), you see more flat tiles covering some of the car and then there's nothing on the side! &nbsp;Basically i just took off the flat tiles and put on two flat 2-by-2's and now the whole thing s smooth. &nbsp;But enough of the cons, lets get too the good part of this speedster.</div><div>The front opens up. You can put something on the smaller size in there. The back looks sweet as well. &nbsp;The V8 engine (For once they finally put an engine in a car!) in the back of the car adds style. &nbsp;The interior looks nice with the blue seats and the steering wheel. &nbsp;Kinda wish they would have put a shift stick in there, and also a little more parts in there would have been nice too.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, if you've been wanting this set, all it needs is a little optimism and it's the best car&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;made! &nbsp;But if you want a perfect car... well lets just say you will find mistakes. &nbsp;It is pretty easy to ignore the cons though.</div>",TRUE,4,5,5,2,1

<p>And obviously we can continue to build amazing things with this set that was originally released in 2010.&nbsp; Very Enjoyable Builds.</p>
