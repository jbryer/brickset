Not that I though it looked bad, I just didn't think it looked as good as most of the others. I got this thinking it would probably be okay, but not great. It turned out to be better than I had expected.

Pros:
-not a black roof.
-basket ball hoop.
-Good colors. red white and blue.
-Looks good with other creator homes.
-Pretty sturdy.

Cons:
-not a real baseket ball.
-No minifigs.

This is a good set, and looks great with the beach, family, and red roof house.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"darkmoonlady","2009-12-20T03:35:19.873Z","I really like this","Picked up this set at Fred Meyer here in Oregon for a very reasonable 35.99 on sale. When I saw the set online I couldn't wait to pick it up as I just finished building the Family Home. I'd say this set although smaller has still got a lot good detail and great parts. The lawnmower especially, I can't wait to pick up another set and swap out the yellow for green or blue.  

I haven't built the other two houses yet but from the manual they look pretty interesting. One thing the garage has no wall between it and the ""living space"" in the house, which seems a bit odd. Other than that the blue roof pieces alone make it worth the price tag, as well as they tan windows and doors.

Pro would have to be the roof pieces and windows, great for MOC's. 
Smaller than the family home but if you can get it at a discount even better. 

Love this set, highly recommend it. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2009-12-30T23:00:40.17Z","NIce Creator House","If you are a fan of the Creator houses, you will like this house. If you have not had the opportunity to build one of these houses, I suggest you get out there and get this one.  There are many great elements that not only help to make a nice house, but will give you new ideas for putting together some of your own ideas.

One great aspect of this house is the roof.  There are many great lines that would look good in many of today's modern designs as well as classic houses.  The two forward facing house sections blend in wonderfully with the larger roof.

Another build feature is the tree.  I know, there is not too much that can be special about a tree, but this is the ""Apple Tree House"" after all.  What is nice about the tree is how different it is from other trees in the series.  It would have been easy to just throw in an old-school tree piece with the set.  But the tree would have been small and it would look out of place.  Here, the designers made a tree that is ready for picking and looks less round than the Beach House.

The basketball hoop, lawn mower, and mail box are all great little extras that really make this build seem more ""homey.""

The only complaint I have about the set is the lack of detail on the back.  Not even one window?  This is the reason the Apple Tree House looses one point.  LEGO sets, especially in the Creator line should be appealing 360 degrees, not just from the front.

That being said, this is a great set, a beautiful house, and I look forward to building the other two houses that the set can be made into... if I can bring myself to tear this one down.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Lego_Minifig_Man","2010-02-15T10:13:12.577Z","Welcome to Your New Home!","<p>I bought this set at Toys 'R' Us the other day along with 3177 Small Car. It was like $70 I think...</p>
<p>By the way, I'm doing the review only on the Apple Tree House version of this set, no the other two sets you can make from this one.</p>
<h4>House Exterior</h4>
<p>Thr outside of the house is great! There's some steps at the door, which I really like but I don't know why they put the vent piece there. I really like the mailbox. There's a lantern-type light next to the door, and a light over the garage door. The satellite dish is genius. There's windowsills there also. The chimmeny is two different colors, which I'm not too fond of. There's a outside tap over a vent piece. And there's a storm drain on the left of the house, which is really creative. But there's not one thing on the back of the house! Not even one of those little windows! Most of the windows can't be opened without taking off the roof, which is a bad design flaw. The garage door opens! I had trouble getting it open so I pulled off the roof and stuck my hand in and pushed. But it's hard to fit&nbsp; 3177 Small Car in the garage. It's a bit too high.&nbsp;There's these circular grey&nbsp;things that the garage door's attached to which stand out. Also on the roof theres the grey pieces under the top part of the roof which stand out.</p>
<h4>House Interior</h4>
<p>You can take off the roof on the right side of the house to see inside. There's nothing inside at all except a ladder!&nbsp; I think they could've done a bit better making the ladder.&nbsp; The mailbox is made so when you push the mail through the slot it pops out inside. The left side of the house has a area where a short minifigure can fit into, which I think was meant to be the attic. There's no way to get into the area above the garage door- not the actual garage, the garage door.</p>
<h4>Landscape</h4>
<p>The outside of the house is nice. The baseplate it's on is actually two smaller ones held together by two flat 2x4 pieces on both sides. There's a apple&nbsp;tree, which has lost&nbsp;5 apples and 3 of them are&nbsp; on some kind of stump, but there's no empty places on the tree where the 5 apples could've been. There's another stump-thing nex to the garage and the front door, which has some peices on it which may be supposed to be flowers...? There's two identical&nbsp;bushes with yellow pieces on them at different&nbsp;places on the lawn. There's a nice bench on the right of the house. I really like the walkway that leads to the house! In front of the garage is a driveway, which is spaced out a lot.&nbsp; And finally I get to the basketball net. *sigh* this part was really poorly done. the basketball is a orange stud. The net is a life-preserver/toilet seat. Since they've already made good basketball peices for the basketball sets you'd think they'd use them...</p>
<h4>Other</h4>
<p>The mailbox comes with two letters that aren't stickers (I don't know why everyone hates stickers! I've had a set with a sticker since 2000 or 2002 and it's still on there, didn't loosen since the day I put it on!) And there's a lawnmower. The lawnmower is my favourite part of the set because it's so simple. I just don't like the look of the handle part...</p>
<h4>Construction and Playability</h4>
<p>This took me a while to build, but I was also watching a movie at the time on TV so...&nbsp; I really didnt' like building the roof. You just keep doint the same thing over and over.</p>
<p>This set can be played with a lot and is ideal for videos, but it DIDN'T COME WITH A MINIFIGURE! So you'll need to buy another set with a minifigure to have real fun playing with it.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>I would reccomend this set to every town or city fan there is! I think you might want to get it on sale though because I'm not sure it's worth $68 or somthing...</p>

"Niallskie","2009-12-22T03:09:12.123Z","Color scheme is awesome","An Oregonian as well and had the same luck as the last posting as I got this set at Fred Meyer for a discounted price of $34.99 (20% off) af Fred Meyer. Grab this awesome set before the store closed for the night, then wanted to get another one as I was really amazed with this set but sad so say they went back on the original price in the morning after, I was just lucky to get that discount when I got my set. And to think that this is a new set.

I love the color scheme of this house, blue roof alone is a big change from other houses with red or black roofing. Fantastic mixing of color of grey on the bottom part of the house, red boarder then white, really makes this house quite unique. Same comment about the garage having no wall between it and the living room. Nothing major as it is fixable by the right colored bricks if the open space others you. The lawnmower and the basketball hoop is a great addition to the house, gives the feel of a typical suburban house.

All in all this is a set worth buying at its original price of $44.99, what more if it's on sale right? Oh and I guess the creator series of lego are not supposed to have any minifigure just incase some are wondering why there are no minifigures in this set. One good advace is to get the lego set 3177 (City Car), it is a smart car with one minifigure which will definitely fit to this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-05-22T19:34:49.06Z","Great house","<p>I got this set for my birthday and it took about 75 minutes to build. Once completed, I was very impressed with the overall look of the set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Landscape:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;yard includes details such as a lawnmower, basketball hoop, apple tree, apple pieces, two bushes, flowerpot, and bench. Tan-coloured stepping stones form the pathway that leads to the entrance of the house. The overall appearance of the yard gives it a countryside feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The House:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exterior Details-There is a tap for running water on the side of the house. There is also a chimney and satellite dish on the roof. Lastly, there is a mail slot beside the door. The house has two lights, one above the garage and one beside the entrance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interior-There is a garage, living area, and attic in the house. The garage forms about half the area of the house. The interior of the house is completely empty except for a ladder that leads to the attic.&nbsp;&nbsp;There should've been a wall that separates the garage from the living area, but this is easy to fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design-The house is made up of generally white bricks; the first two layers of bricks&nbsp;are grey, separated from the white bricks with a red trim. The roof is made up of rare navy blue-coloured tiles, and a section of&nbsp;the roof&nbsp;can be lifted off to allow access to interior. An opening&nbsp;red garage door nicely contrasts the rest of the house. However, the roof&nbsp;over the attic does not lift off&nbsp;unless you&nbsp;tear down each of the individual tiles. As such, the attic is very hard to access. The same problem applies for the garage: the roof does not lift off easily, making it very difficult to play inside it. Also, the garage has a clearance of 5 bricks high, but the garage door reduces the clearance&nbsp;to 4 1/3 bricks. Therefore, only convertables can&nbsp;go into&nbsp;the garage without scraping the garage door. The living area is&nbsp;a cramped&nbsp;72 square studs, therefore putting in furniture is difficult. I made the attic the bedroom, there is simply no space for storage. Theoretically, the entire house can fit on a single 16x32 baseplate, but this does not matter unless you want to save space in your city.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Overall this is an excellent&nbsp;house, and because of the number and variety of bricks that are given, you can build your own creations with the same pieces. At $59.99 CAD this is an excellent deal; Creator sets tend to be less expensive than sets from&nbsp;other themes, such as City and Star Wars. This set is a great addition to any city, and I recommend that you get it if you see it. Also, in case you're wondering, Lego is releasing a City theme&nbsp;based house later in the year (Family Home 8403). </p>

I love the color combination that they are using for this set. It is a really nice combination and it looks great.<br><br>Until a couple years ago, every building that Lego launched is a building with a function, whether it is a police office, a fire department, or something. So these were the buildings that dominating my city at that time. And it felt really strange, since in reality, the regular houses should be more in quantity comparing with the police office and everything. So I really happy when Lego start launching a couple of house shape sets, eventhough they launched as Creator themes, not city.&nbsp; It allows me to create a more realistic looking city.<br><br>What I like about the set :<br>1. The apple tree (as the set is named) is really nice, eventhough it looks a bit thin. <br>2. The lawnmower also a bit details that can give a more real house feeling. <br>3. The red door garage and a car park in front of it that serve as a mini basket ball course as well.<br>4. The spotlight over the garage<br>5. The mailbox and the hanging lamp on the porch<br>These things really gives the set a realistic feeling.<br><br>What I don't like about the set :<br>The set is having two different scales, the scale is not consistent in all part of the sets : The most troubling thing for me is the basketball. In reality, a basketball should be bigger than an apple, right? But here in this set, both of them using the same scale.<br><br>As conclusion, I really recommended this for City lovers that searching for some regular houses for their city. It really bring a nice touch with their nice blue-white color combinations.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"meyerc13","2011-01-05T17:10:20.39Z","Not enough plates or windows","<p>I know this won't be a popular opinion, but this set falls short.&nbsp; Short on plates, short on windows, and short on the price per piece ratio as compared to other Creator Houses.&nbsp; If you like the designs on the box, you'll probably like this set.&nbsp; If you would rather use the parts to build your own creations (this is a 'Creator' set after all), you'll be disappointed.&nbsp; Please give me a chance to make my case, even if you don't agree with my opinion hopefully you can see that this review will be helpful for others who may be considering this as a parts pack.&nbsp; The question isn't whether you agree or not, but whether the review could help someone or not.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The set isn't all bad, all three of the models for which you are given instructions are fun to build and attractive to look at.&nbsp; I've gotten new ideas and learned new tricks from every Creator house I've built, and this one is no exception.<br></li><li>Another great thing about this set is roof tiles.&nbsp; That's definitely an area where this set doesn't fall short.&nbsp; They're not the most common color, which is great for adding variety to your City.&nbsp; There are also some useful inside corner roof tiles which are very nice to have.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The first problem with this set is the color - white.&nbsp; I have plenty of white bricks, so as a parts pack getting more white bricks isn't the most useful thing.&nbsp; I understand why LEGO didn't release this as a tan house, because there was another tan house on the market at the same time.&nbsp; But why not gray?&nbsp; Or a pastel blue?&nbsp; Anything but another white house.<br></li><li>That's a minor gripe compared to my next problem, not enough large plates.&nbsp; I like to build houses for minifigs, and this set is severely lacking in plates.&nbsp; You can see it on the cover of the box - the floor of the house is the green base plate.&nbsp; The second story is mostly built on 2 stud wide plates, which aren't the most solid base to use as a floor.&nbsp; I really wish this set had included some 6x8, 6x10, 8x8, etc. plates to use as floors instead of all of the 2 wide plates.</li><li>This set is also very low on Windows and Doors.&nbsp; Maybe I was spoiled by the 4996 Beach House, but this set is severely lacking in doors and windows.&nbsp; I love the windows they included, I just wish they had included a few more of the 4 wide by 3 high Windows.&nbsp; I generally build open backed houses in the Lego City style, and even with no back wall I still find I don't have enough windows to build a two story house.&nbsp; That's frustrating and since the tan and white windows aren't very common you will probably end up switching out all of the windows in this house if you intend to depart from the instruction manuals.</li><li>My final complaint is that the houses aren't mini-fig friendly.&nbsp; I like the Beach House because it included the three story apartment house model with an open back, made in the Lego City style.&nbsp; This set doesn't include a similar model, and with the limited windows and plates you'll be challenged to come up with one of your own without additional parts that you won't find in the box.<br></li></ul>In conclusion, if you want roof tiles in a nice blue color or want to stick to the manuals, you'll probably be satisfied by this set because it's fun to build and nice to look at.&nbsp; The lawnmower is particularly clever.&nbsp; However, if you are looking for parts, for the price you may be better off looking elsewhere.&nbsp; Pick up one of the now discontinued sets if you can find them, or wait for the successors to those which will hopefully be more useful than this set.&nbsp; If you must buy this set, buy at least two, along with some large plates so that you can build something without frustration.<br>",TRUE,3,2,4,4,3

<p>Compared to the previous Creator home (yellow) that I had purchased, this set seems to be lacking a bit mostly in interior design.</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>-Unuseable upper level - the attic space is kind of neat though.</p>
<p>-very weak and non-predominant tree (only one?) which is odd for the set being called Apple Tree House.&nbsp; I have yet to see a sturdy, modern&nbsp;Lego tree come to think of it (minus the molded palm trees) The tree itself and the tiny roots are easily...uprooted.</p>
<p>-Basketball is not to scale and could have been the actual Lego b-balls they used for earlier sets with mini-figs.</p>
<p>-Garage takes up half of the house - there'd be carbon-monoxide issues if this were real as there is no separation betwen garage and main part of house.</p>
<p>-quite a bit of unused lawn space.</p>
<p>-no detail, furniture on inside.</p>
<p>-High in price. Would value it at perhaps $35 ($10 cheaper than current retail)</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>-nice details as far as lawn mower (mini fig scale), outside faucet, (maybe a hose attachment would be nice?) felled apples, hoops, light fixtures, roofing structure and mailbox (open at both ends so mail falls into the house - could also be a con I suppose)</p>
<p>-Can fit many lego cars</p>
<p>-2 plates for landscape</p>
<p>-Great colour scheme especially for roof.</p>
<p>-Tons of longer pieces both roof and main building</p>
<p>-Works well for mini figs</p>
<p>-Adds to Lego skyline</p>
<p>-Has instructions for 2 other builds.</p>
<p>Overall, I'd suggest this set if you are heavily into Creator series or have the desire for a different home for your Lego village.&nbsp; Otherwise for price (unless you find it on clearance), I'd check out the Yellow Summer Home set first or perhaps the newer and cheaper Log Cabin.</p>",TRUE,3,4,5,3,3
"Ernst","2012-04-08T04:58:36.907Z","The Apple Tree House, good with some remarks.","<p>Overall 4 bricks : Another nice Creator Set with 3 nice buildings, some very usefull parts but also some things missing. A good remark for the colors chosen. A set that is nice to own but not really one you would miss if you don't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building&nbsp;3 bricks :&nbsp;I will edit the review later when I have built the other books.</p>
<ul>
<li>Book 1: Building is a fun experience but overall easy and basic. The walls, windows and doors are easy for a bit more experienced builder. The roof asks a bit more attention but not too difficult either. The result is a nice looking house with nice details like the tree, baskethoop and lawn mower. The result is nice but looking round the house you miss a rear window and small window in the garage. A wall dividing the garage and house would have been nice too. And maybe next time a minifigure, I added <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=852996-1"">Max</a> and let him&nbsp;handle the lawnmower which made a nice complete scenery. One more remark : the plates for the garage entrance are too wide for the small average Lego car. For a good drive in you have put the outer plates to the inside.</li></ul>
<p>Parts 4 bricks : the parts offered in this set are good. I like especially the Dark Blue slopes and the Green ones. The Tan colored parts are very nice too. Missing are like said before a minifigure and some extra windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 bricks : like all Creator sets 5891 offers 3 building possibilities so the 4 bricks are well deserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 3 bricks : RRP in Holland some €45,00 which is not bad but not cheap either, I bought it used (as good as new)&nbsp;for €35,00 so a bit cheaper. Since it is not a spectacular set I would advise to wait and buy it used.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"dougts","2011-05-10T13:35:30.66Z","Good, not great","<p>Nice looking house with a good color scheme</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>little extras, such as basketball hoop and lawn mower</li><li>gabled roof with lots of good roof tiles</li><li>white/blue color scheme looks sharp</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>garage not really high enough to hold any cars</li><li>lack of interior space</li><li>garage just flows into house, no interior wall/door</li></ul>
<p>Not the best creator house yet, but a solid entry. &nbsp;Like most of them, they are better served as display items rather than playsets, which is what I get them for generally. &nbsp;The lawn mover and basketball hoop are nice touches and well designed.</p><p>I actually modified mine by removing the garage, and instead builidng a 10x20ish house with 2 upper gabled windows and a full 2nd store with removable roof. &nbsp;I only needed to add a few more windows and a minimium amount of white building bricks. &nbsp;I added a few more grey flat tiles tot he ones included a made a full 10x10 basketball court. &nbsp;Daughter got a lot of playability out of my design.</p><p>A solid entry in the Creator house series, but nothing jaw-dropping.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4
"odueck","2012-08-09T09:35:33.653Z","Very well designed set","<p>I'm a big fan of Lego buildings, particularly the Creator sets and modular buildings. The Apple Tree House is the first of these buildings that I've owned.</p><p><br></p><p>First of all, I find this set very aesthetically pleasing. I love the color scheme. The house itself is very well designed, with a fairly complex roof. The swing open garage door is a nice touch. A few more windows on the back and garage side of the house would have been nice but that's a very minor complaint.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the very strong points of this set, in my opinion, is the large number of roof pieces. There's also several windows and a door, making it easy to build other buildings with this set's pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>As nice as the house itself is, it's the details that really impress: The basketball net, lawnmower, satellite dish, etc. Unfortunately, the interior of the house is not very detailed but this does allow for some customization. There isn't much room in the attic though.</p><p><br></p><p>Some people will be disappointed with the lack of mini-figures. This doesn't bother me so much. However, a vehicle would have been a nice addition, especially considering that the house has a garage.</p><p><br></p><p>I've built the Apple Tree House itself twice, and the alternate models each once. All are fun to build but the Apple Tree House is definitely the best design of the three. Overall an excellent set which should appeal to kids and adults alike.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,3,4

I love taking it apart and debating over which one to build. I absolutely love this set and recommend it to experienced LEGO builders.</p>

"The_Constructionator","2016-12-28T05:08:17.413Z","THE creator set ","<p>This house was awesome and just what i would ask for from a creator set</p>

<p>Pros: Lots of white bricks, 2 baseplates, tons of windows, a few play functions</p>

<p>Cons: The color of roof is not able to combine&nbsp;with many other sets, no minifigure to play with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i&#39;d say this is a very iconic creator set, and one that will be remembered. because for a house, this is THE creator set</p>

"Mask_of_Control","2019-08-27T15:11:41.21Z","Good choice to make a Lego City better!","<p>I receive this set in 2011 and I think that this is&nbsp;the best set that I&nbsp;have.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>&raquo; Incredible design.</p>

<p>&raquo; Good variety of accessories.</p>

<p>&raquo; Good detail.</p>

<p>&raquo; Very good addition to a Lego City.</p>

<p>&raquo; Good for those who do not have modular buildings.</p>

<p>&raquo; The play value is great&nbsp;as long as you have a minifigure.</p>

<p>&raquo; The model is hard to break&nbsp;because of its good design.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p>&raquo; The house&#39;s&nbsp;floor is grass&nbsp;which is easy to solve.</p>

<p>&raquo; The garage is to small for normal Lego City cars.</p>

<p>&raquo; Only one part of the roof can be removed.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>The set is the best choice if you do not want to spend to much money in modular buildings and if you want to have a nice City.</p>

<h3>Set score</h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>10/10</strong></p>
