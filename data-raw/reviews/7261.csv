"meyerc13","2009-12-17T02:14:38.403Z","smart Little Car","I found this set tonight for $4.99US at the local Toys R Us store and picked it up.  My wife looked at it after my son and I put it together and instantly named the real life vehicle that obviously served as the inspiration for this car, so I think LEGO hit a home run in the design department.  The mini-fig is also nice, with a double sided torso displaying the pocket and hood from his hoodie.

I almost rated this lower, mostly based on the price.  If you compare the finished vehicle to the 7236 police car, which typically sells for only about $1 more, it just seems so small.  I like 7236 because it has good parts for making your own vehicles.  It doesn't seem like this set could possibly have the same valuable pieces in such a small package.  However, looking at the pieces you do get, you get a windshield, mudguards, a hood/roof piece, and doors.  Yes, doors!  These are great pieces for building your own creations.  The only bad thing is that you get one black mudguard and one white mudguard, so pick up two of these sets if you plan to make your own creations using that part.

Don't let the small size fool you, this is a great little car.  For not much more than an impulse mini-fig set, you get a mini-fig with a car.  Yes, the car is small, but when you compare it to the real life inspiration it is supposed to be small.  Pick these up when you spot them, but grab a few because for the price you'll get some great parts that are very useful.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"oleksoccer","2009-12-17T16:55:18.5Z","flawed design","This car looks like a Smart. It is tiny, but for the price, it is a great value, including a brand-new minifig with a hoodie and dark brown hair. It would be a great set if you could actually put the roof on with the minifig inside. The roof is too low and won't fit on because of the minifig's head. I am currently trying to modify it so it doesn't look too different but will fit the minifig.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"parrafilmsguy","2009-12-30T03:33:48.607Z","Awesome!","LEGO should keep on making sets like this!

I found it at TRU and thankfully I got 20% off their inflated price so it ended up being about the same.

For those of you complaining about the ""design flaw""... there really isn't one. Why would LEGO release a car with such an obvious flaw? All you have to do is make the minifigure lean forward instead of sitting up perfectly straight.

I love the minifigure except for the green pants. I traded them for tan and now it looks way better.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Niallskie","2009-12-22T03:26:03.093Z","Ain't it cute","Read the reviews here then was off to purchase little bad boy for 20% less at our local Fred Meyer store. Put it together and wow, this set is really cute. Fun to play with and it has the cute minifigure with a hoody, guess it's worth the  price. I have to agree that the design of the roof along with the red signal light is flawed as the roof could not be closed with the minifigure inside. Easy fix my friend, take out the red signal light and the roof is a perfect fit even with the minifigure is driving. Then again if the design requires the car to have a red signal light for stopping, what I did is I put it under the white part at the back that connects to the black rim piece for the back tires. Those who have this set will see that there is a white brick that is like a small L that goes in the back. With those easy fix the smart car is ready to roll, oh and you can also put the brief case at back while the minifigure is drivin it. I paired this cuty with the new Creator 5891 (Apple Tree House), they are a perfect pair I tell you. I gave it a 4 out of 5 just coz of the design flaw, I'm sure even if the set is a small build, they have quality control specially with the design.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"DevDevBeck","2010-01-02T01:40:16.343Z","Worth the Money!","Lego's new 'Small Car' is an accurate portrayal of the new mini 'Smart Car'. This is a wonderful little set that includes a mini figure, his briefcase, and, of course, the Smart Car.

The Minifigure: 
The minifigure includes a new hairpiece which I personally have never seen before. I enjoy the design of his hoodie, however the green colored pants do not match the minifigure's outfit, so I replaced them with a black pair.
Overall: 3/5

The Smart Car:
The car itself is very nice. Like the real thing, the wheels are tiny, it's stumpy, and it doesn't have much of a trunk. It's pretty much self explanatory how the car is. I did not like the juniorization of the car dies to the fact that it has one piece covering the axles and the bottom of the cab, and they could have added a rear trunk, they don't have any cover. Overall, the car is nice and its paint scheme is decent.
Overall: 4/5

I'm going to givew the 'Small Car' a score of 4 because it is very small, only 2 inches long, and that the minifigure's pants are green, and lastly, because there is not much for a trunk/rear window.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"galonschiente","2010-01-17T17:00:02.547Z","This has got to be the cutest LEGO set ever!","I have wanted this set because of the minifig for quite some time now, So what a surprise I got, when my Mum came home with this set for me! 

Minifigure- This minifigure has a very cool hoodie torso that is amazing for customs, (which is what I used it for) and some very odd green trousers! His face reminds me of Mutt Williams' face from Indiana Jones, but in yellow! He even has Mutt hair for a finshing touch to the likeness!

Accessory- A suitcase is the accessory for this set. Nothing special, but it is quite cool.

Car- This car is the smallest car LEGO has made that I am aware of. The cuteness just never wears of, and it can fit in the palm of your hand! The colour scheme works well and there is a compartment for the suitcase at the back. It is great for city collections and movies!

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2010-01-05T13:06:25.373Z","City Car…","I ordered this from Lego.com on the 30.12.09 and it arrived today (05.01.10).   As soon as I saw this set in the previews I knew that it would soon be joining my collection, and I am really glad that it has.

This is one of the latest cars from the City range which I have bought recently, and compared to the supplied minifig and the other cars which have been released recently, this car is very small and typical of the many small ‘city cars’ which are currently on the market.   It looks similar to a Smart Car, but it could be representative of the Toyota IQ.  One thing is for certain, Lego seem to have got it just right with this set.   The car is presented in a clean black and white colour scheme.   The front area features a white bumper, number plate holder (but no number plate), small round headlights and a grille.   There is no bonnet, but a slanted windscreen adds to the sporty feel of the car.   Two white doors are provided to gain access along with a removable roof.   A high visibility red ‘stop’ lamp is incorporated into the roof panel.   The gradual slope of the rear quarter meets the rear wheels but no bumper is provided.   There is a small luggage area provided at the rear of the car for the attaché case (provided).   The minifig wears a trendy haircut, hooded top and green trousers.   Could he be a student?   I could imagine him parking on my university campus!

Well, my first set of 2010, and an excellent, excellent choice.   Great price and a great ‘fresh’ set.

Well done Lego!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Krogh","2009-12-30T08:26:10.547Z","Great little set.","Let me start of by saying, that the design flaw with the roof, does not exist. As mentionet below, the minifig just have to lean forward slightly, but to do that his hands has to be above the doors, so it doesn't look natural. Just like a real smart car! :)

Secondly, i don't like the color scheme. Reminds me to much of a police set. And, why does the tile below the grill have to be green? Looks weird, and the same thing goes for the brick beneath the stearing wheel. But these are the only complants i have.

The build reminds me of the older town sets, it's very simple, yet entertaining, and the end product has lots of playability. I wish there were more small car sets today.

The minifig is okay, i don't care for the brown eyebrows, in my opinion that limits the type of hair he can wear. The hoodie also got me wondering, ehen we will see lego baggy pants? Not looking forward to that one, hehe.

Every newer lego town should have this little car driving around on the streets. It doesn't fare so well in a classic town though.

So, it's up to you if you want to pick it up, personally i almost didn't when i read about the so called roof flaw, luckely it was not a problem at all, so i was pleased by the set. :)

I give it a 4/5. The green pieces simply does not belong in this set, and that affects my grade. To bad.

minifig:its ok i like the hoodie body piece but the green pants ehhh id rather have blue or a color that would look better. and the hairpiece its used WAY TOO MUCH cant they make a new hairpiece, i also like the briefcase(suitcase, whatever) but you cant really fit anything into it. 2/5

small car:I like it, and really there is no flaw all you have to do is push the minifig closer to the steering wheel.the only thing i didnt like was the color scheme its sorta boring and white and black are used way too much in city sets 4/5

The little tires are great, giving a bit of a sport look to the car.  And for such a low price, it would be easy to amass a small fleet of these things.

I think customization on these would be easy too.  It could be like the Scion of the Lego world.  Change the black to red, or add details to the body, there are endless possibilities on this one.  

The only problem I had with building was getting the driver in the car, but he just needs to sit forward a little with his arms up a little higher than usual.

<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are in booklet form and show LEGO's clear step-by-step illustrations for putting this set together.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a total of 43 pieces in this set. Most of which are black and white pieces for the main color of this car. Notable accessory piece in this set is a grey suitcase, showing that this minifigure may be on his way to or from work.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get one minifigure in this set, featuring a guy with a white hoodie sweater on and the deep pockets in front. At first glance, i thought that was a doctor's mask til I looked closer and saw the hood print on the back. He's a good additional civilian minifigure for a City collection and adding variety to a LEGO City or Town and custimization.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The build for this set is one of the newer electrical cars and in brick form, I'd say it's a very good likeness. In all, it only took me five minutes and is fairly simple. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As stated before, this is a perfect car for adding detail and character to a larger LEGO City or collection.

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-14T12:26:11.52Z","LEGO City Smart Car","<p>Set #3177 Small Car: In real life you don't see many people driving these cars, but they do occassionally appear on the road. So it makes sense that LEGO would make one available in their LEGO City for you to add to your vehicle menagerie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model is compact, it uses black and white pieces mostly to make a little Smart Car for the LEGO Citizen to drive. The model is fast and simple to build, but it does have a few odd choices in the design. The rear of the vheicle is open to the air (not good for winter driving in snowy climes.), understandably this is done so that you can slip the suitcase in and out easily, but it does make for a car that isn't completely closed off from the elements. It also doesn't have door windows (although I don't know any LEGO Automobiles that actually do have door windows.), and the Mini-Figure is a bit tricky to get into the car and seal the roof back shut. Mostly because of the hair piece, I finally figured out which angle to leave the torso at in order to close the roof back over him so he can sit and drive and not get rained on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure himself is fun looking, he comes with a double sided torso that resembles a sweatshirt with hoody, the print is very nice and it makes me wish that LEGO had given him a hat piece that made it look like he was actually wearing the hoody as well as the hair piece. He also comes with a suitcase. I'm not sure if he's on a trip or he's going to the office on casual Friday with his briefcase full of paperwork... Either way he's a great addition to LEGO City.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that buying this set is something all fans of LEGO City should do, it's cheap and a fun little car to put next to your larger vehicles. Now if LEGO would just make a new version available in alternate colors, perhaps a rich dark green and blue combo for the next version. You can't go wrong with the price either, but steer clear of picking this up at TRU in Canada, they've bumped the price up confusingly so from 6.99$ to 7.99$ meaning you're paying 2$ more after taxes.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

It is well worth the price at just $8.99 NZD.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Whenever I look at this car it makes me think of Smart cars, so they are good to transport buisnessman.<br/>The minifigure is really detailed with lots of colours.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Is very easy to build for experienced builders, but would more challenging for beginners.<br/>If you are this sort person, it is very easy to modify into 'Hotrod' or something similar.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>OVERALL I GIVE IT 10/10.",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

"coldcomfort","2011-01-08T04:53:19.46Z","3177 Small Car - Help your Lego City ""go green"" with this new Smart Car.","First of all, I have to point out that my ratings of sets are subjective
 based on what I believe the overall intent of the set to be. For 
example, my expectations of $100 USD+ major sets are much higher and 
more detailed than my expectations for middle price point and 
inexpensive impulse sets. When I decided to pick up this set I expected a cool new minifigure and a cool new car. Bearing those criteria in mind, this kit is everything I wanted from it.<br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The minifigure is attractive and a civilian. This is important to me because as a buyer of sets in retail stores I have wound up with far more police officers, firefighters and construction workers than regular folk.<br></li><li>The car is a dead ringer for a Smart Car - adding elements of authenticity, modernity and environmental consciousness to the City theme. It also has the same color scheme as the vehicles driven by those Geek Squad tech support folks here in the states, so if you'd like you could find a decal and have a real world brand in your City.<br></li><li>The car is actually quite a bit more detailed than I initially thought it would be. It has working doors, a roof and even a storage compartment for the driver's briefcase. I was kind of impressed with this because oftentimes the smaller vehicles included in the larger more expensive sets do not have these features. For example consider the little red car included in the 7288 Mobile Police Unit set. While it has working doors, it lacks both a roof and any storage area.</li><li>This set is a strong value. Having purchased mine via the internet I paid a bit more than those of you that may have the opportunity to buy it locally might, but even with the extra dollar or so for shipping I think it's well worth the money.</li><li>What could possibly be more playable than a little car?<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>

<p>Since this set delivers exactly what I expected from it and does so at a price I feel is better than reasonable I can't think of a single bad thing to say about it. It's inexpensive, smartly designed and fun. If you enjoy the City theme, this is a vehicle you'll likely want to include in your motor pool.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"davy_jones","2020-05-05T01:50:16.913Z","Think Small","<p>&nbsp;Two famous car advertisements came to mind when reviewing this set. One is the Beetle&#39;s think small advertisement while the other is Mini&#39;s &#39;You Don&#39;t Need A Big One To Be Happy&#39;. This set proves that thinking on a smaller scale can sometimes produce wonderful outcomes, hence the title of this review based on the former advertisement campaign.</p>

<p>The Good:</p>

<p>&nbsp;1) Opening doors are a wonderful feature and this tiny set has a pair of them. It adds that tiny bit of playability.</p>

<p>2) The design of the vehicle also resembles a Smart car from yesteryears as already pointed out by several reviewers. But perhaps what makes this set really cheerful is the fact that the pieces used are fairly conventional and can be swapped out with other colours. This gives rise to endless customization possibilities.</p>

<p>3) This set can be considered an army builder which can be used to populate your growing Lego City scene on display. Imagine a city filled with these tiny wonders in various colors or even multicolored versions. In fact, I even customized mine to have spoilers inspired by Pikes Peak racers. The short video on this can be found in the video reviews section. The best part is the set retailed at a very reasonable price back when it was launched.</p>

<p>4) One youthful looking minifigure is also included. He wears a hoodie which is in tune with his youthful character although the accompanying briefcase feels out of place.</p>

<p>The Bad:</p>

<p>Conventional pieces used and very fast build.</p>

<p>The verdict:</p>

<p>The set has good smiles per buck value and fulfills it&#39;s purpose either on it&#39;s own or as an addition to your Lego scene. As the latter quoted ad mentions, &#39;You Don&#39;t Need A Big One To Be Happy&#39;.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box shows the minifg in his car, then on the reverse side, shows him stepping out of the car.<br>http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2584/4194845128_980269fc10_z.jpg<br><br>The instructins are clear and consise as always.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4>One of the parts included with this set is a new plate with pins on the side to put the wheels on. The car's main bulk is this peice. Its neat, but doesn't hold much use outside of building this car. But as a rare peice, it justify's buying this set just for that peice and the fig.
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set only has one minifig. I already described his peices, but his body peice is my first of that type. As everyone else, I thought it was a surgical mask, but it is a hoodie. But I would like to see the lego hospital theme brought back.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>The build is simple and quick. No complicated techniques or strange ways of building. Its basically what you would think for a car. Plate underneath, put on wheels. Put on wheel guard. Place grill peice on front. Etc.&nbsp;
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is very fun to play with and is much smaller than I actually thought. Its fun to zoom around your floors, and can fit the minifigs breifcase in the back. I suppose its ment as a trunk, but I cant find much else to fit back there.</p><p>Great edition to your city, it looks amazing outside my green grocer.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4>This model is cheap, it is currently on sale at Target for $4.50, so you can buy it with a fiver. It is small but packs a great deal of variety in your city, and really, how many civilian vechiles are in the city line? I plan on buying a couple more as they are going to be discontinued soon. Defeintly a must have, and can fit anyones budget. Its worth it for the rare peice or the fig, and everything else is just extra. Oh, and it has extra peices! Every model has a couple, but no matter what they are, its nice to get something free. I reccomend it to everyone, no matter what theme you like, you will find a use for it.

"bricksan","2012-06-12T09:23:09.503Z","3177 Small Car","<div>After doing 5 straight classic Pirate reviews, I thought it would be worth reviewing other sets I own. So I have now switched to the City theme. This combined with the Modulars is currently my favourite theme due to my City Project. The set I have selected to review first is the one of the smallest boxed sets you can have.</div><div><br></div><div>Obviously there are the smaller polybag sets but there is something quirky with this set that made me do an impulse by from Asada Living. The set cost me £3.49 and is still on general sale, ranging from anything from £3.99 on shop@home to £3.79 in stores such as ASDA and Tesco.</div><div><br></div><h4>Introduction</h4><div><br></div><div>The set was released in December 2009 and is a 4 stud wide car. In the City theme you either get 4 stud vehicles or 6 stud vehicles . I usually prefer the large 6 stud ones as they are more detailed. However this car reminds me of the Smart Car you find in most City centers in the UK.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The set is pocket money purchase I would assume these days. I know most kids get a lot more pocket money then I did and for £3.99 you get 43 pieces for your money, the minifigure in this look only appears in this set, however the torso has been used on more than one occasion, appearing in various sets, such as the LEGO Marina last year. I would have given the minifigure a suit and it would have been better suited to the car.</div><div>The set comes in a small box, unlike the classic sets you no longer get other ideas on the back which is a shame, on most large City sets you get a comic. This is just set details, copyright writing etc. The instructions comes in a small A6 booklet, that is layed out in a horizontal format. The cover is the car and minifig carrying a briefcase. &nbsp;At the back is &nbsp;two &nbsp;City layouts, one with the fire brigade and one with the airport. Also these days you also get a parts list at the back as well.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div><br></div><div>The build is split into 15 stages, with each stage consisting of adding 2 or more elements to the build. At the start you get the car frame that has been around for a long time, heck I remember having a two white ones for an old LEGO Town Race track, the set was &nbsp;the Motor Speedway from 1987, the element has been used in 79 different sets dating back to the early 80's. Yet it is still a decent element for build small cars.</div><div><br></div><div>Stages 2-4 consists of &nbsp;adding the wheel archers and sides of the car. In &nbsp;stage 5 you add the steering wheel, mounted to two green 1×2 plates, why green though? . Steps 7 though to 9 is spent building the front of &nbsp;the car. It is worth mentioning it is one of the few modern cars not to have a sticker number plate, which is a real shame. The next 4 stages is spent adding the windscreen and black supports for the roof, as well as the black roof. I like how the back light of the car is part of the roof. The last stage is adding the wheels and minifigure.</div><div><br></div><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><div><br></div><div>Overall it is not a hard built, the instructions are simple to follow with nothing hard about the build at all. In truth &nbsp;it is not an exciting build and is one that most in the targeted age range would find easy to assemble. However I do like it for a small set and if anything it adds another car to a City layout for next to nothing, it works out about 9p a piece which is not bad at all.</div><div><br></div><div>Although unless you are a City fan I can’t see it appealing to most AFOL’s but if you are then at less then £4 get one and fill out your City.</div><div><br></div><div>Review on my site:&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/3177-small-car/"">http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/3177-small-car/</a></div><div>Link to images on flickr:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157630111384392/with/7365220318/"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157630111384392/with/7365220318/</a></div>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,5

OK son, go get that set.&quot;.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box, like I typed, looks like heaven, but is devil&#39;s paradise. The box itself is weak, but at least the instructions were easy to read, and if you could, build it WITHOUT the manaul.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Many parts were ordinary, but unlike most cars, this contains a door! Lego is randomly putting doors, and not in others, like in 4207, none have door pieces, but in more recent sets, the regular cars are getting doors, like 60012,60060,60054. Cool pieces like the baseplate and the back slope are new.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set has 1 minifigure, and that is a male who has a messed up brown hair, smile, cool torso with hoodie, and green pants. The torso has back-printing, so it is some extra bonus points.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is easy, and like I said, itt can be so easy, you may not even NEED the instruction book</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The car is more of a Smart car, but a Lego version. I would like to talk to the inventor, because the model is awesome.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I&#39;d give it an 83, because of the low playability, and price. But if you want this set, or your traffic in your town is low, go ahead and get. It won&#39;t hurt. Also, a similar version of the car appears in 7939, one white( the windshield is different) and another black and blue. Finally, in the LEGO Movie, Emmet drives around in this car. Hope this review was helpful.</p>

"brickman3","2015-10-03T17:37:12.563Z","Small, but simple. Just the way I like it!","<p>Normally, I am not one to care about small sets. This one, however, is just so stinking&nbsp;cute it gives me goose bumps. Don&#39;t ask why, it&#39;s a thing. Anyway, I have had this set for about 3 years now, and it is a great thing. I have even figured out how to build it without instructions! Yeah, I have an issue with reading instructions. They feel right for a set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, this set comes with one minifigure. I am not a fan of this, but I can understand with the fact that it is a small set. The figure is a basic man, who looks ready for a job interview. He has a standard hair piece, and a nice smile on his face. The jacket and pants make him look like he is ready for both an interview and a beach day.</p>

<p>The car is a great model. It fits the box&#39;s description: &quot;small car&quot;, perfectly. The front comes with two clear-stud headlights, and a nice white bumper. The back shows where the suitcase can be stored, and has a 2-by-1 red flat on the hood&#39;s top, to imitate a backlight. The space fits the man just barely, so it&#39;s like a shrunk Mini Cooper. The doors open and close nicely, and the wheels are small, but efficient.</p>

"The_Brick_Guy_87","2017-06-28T10:03:44.65Z","Looks good except for the rear","<p>This appears to be the most owned set of 2010. Even many non-City&nbsp;fans appear to have it. The more popular it is, the more loved it seems to be. Personally, I think it is a bit overrated. Read the review to know why.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>43 pieces are included in this set. There aren&#39;t any rare parts here, except for perhaps the small car base. The main colors&nbsp;here are white and black as they make up the car. Not a bad parts selection.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Takes about 3-4 minutes. No special building techniques here.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Once built, you have a minifig and a car.</p>

<p>The minifig appears to be a young student. He has green pants, a white sweater with a hoodie and a wallet, dark brown messy hair and a smile on his face. He also has a brown suitcase. Nothing special but he is a nice civilian for a city.</p>

<p>The car appears to be a mimicry of the Smart Fortwo or the Toyota IQ/Aston Martin Cygnet. It has a white and black color scheme. It has white doors. On the front there are round headlights, a dark grey grille and a 1x2 flat tile serving as a license plate holder, although there is no actual license plate. All good for now.</p>

<p>The rear, however, seems to have been left unfinished by the designer. There is no rear window. The suitcase falls off its storage place easily. The 1x2 transparent red tile does not work well as a brake light IMO. I know this can be fixed by modifying the set, but still!</p>

<p>Another flaw is that the minifig is a little bit hard to put because there is little space inside the car and the roof has the transparent tile underneath it so the minifig has to be in a specific position so you can put the roof back on its place.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is a nice little set for a city. It plays well with other sets, but you can&#39;t play much with it on its own. That, along with the aforementioned 2 flaws lower the rating to a 4. Thanks for reading, and if you find this review unhelpful, please contact me to give me some feedback to write better reviews. Goodbye!</p>

<h3>Box and instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a little box with the typical lego city design. The instructions are small in size and have 16 pages, 11 are actual instructions and the rest are ads for other sets, list of pieces, front and back page.</p>

<h3>Building experience</h3>

<p>Building this set is extremely easy and fast. You can put it together in 5 minutes. It&#39;s easy enough that you can build it without even looking at the instructions. But still it&#39;s very enjoyable!</p>

<p>In this set you won&#39;t find any rare parts. The only semi-interesting part is the minifigure torso.</p>

<h3>Minifgures</h3>

<p>There is only one minifigure in this set. It&#39;s an adult male, probably a middle class citizen. He has common green pants, white hoodie, a very common but happy face and dark brown hair that are common aswell. He has a brown briefcase.</p>

<h3>Complete model</h3>

<p>The car has a black and white theme and resembles a smart. It&#39;s of course very small but still has some details, like the fact that you can store a briefcase in the back. The car still holds up to this day with it&#39;s looks, it doesn&#39;t look outdated even when compared with today&#39;s sets, the only thing that i recommend doing is adding mirrors to it. It&#39;s super easy to do, and adds some detail!</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<h3>Value for money</h3>

<p>It&#39;s cheap, it&#39;s good</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>There aren&#39;t many civilian cars and minifigures in lego city, so this one is a rare but a good thing. It perfectly fits in a realistic city that is set in the 21st century. I recommend it 100%!</p>
