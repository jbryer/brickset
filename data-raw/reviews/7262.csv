this is a nice medium sized set and it is sturdy but best of all is only 11$!
Pros: sturdy
 new hat design
good price
cons:

"Krogh","2009-12-28T15:34:08.34Z","Mixed feelings","Alright, so, my Lego years were the late 80's, to the late 90's, and i have very very fond memories of playing with the good old models. One of my favorite models of the time was the 6673 Solo Trainer plane. I had initialy thought that i would not buy the newer Lego models, as i like the good old classic sets better, but then this set caught my eye, and i thought that it reminded me of the old solo trainer, so i decided to pick it up anyway, and seeing as i was spending money, i also picked up a few other newer models i might review some day.

I will try not to compare this brand new set to much with the older 6673, but i might mention a few things anyway.

So, looking at the picture before i bought it, the first thing that caught my eye, was the odd tail section. The underside looks like it needs reinforcement, it doesn't look long enough compared to the top side. Looks kinda weird. I would think that the hull on the underside would go all the way out to the end of the tail. 

After finishing the build and looking at the finished model, i have a few minor complaints. Note, that they are minor and will not affect my final grade much. 
First of all, i HATE stickers!! I don't understand why they can't print the parts anymore, it just sucks with the stickers. I guess it's cheaper to produce them, than it is printing the individual parts. Second, the landing gear is really unstable and lose. it doesn't fall of, but it's just way to wobly. I am thinking of replacing it with some proper wheels, or seeing if i can modify it to not radle around all the time. Third, the tail wings are way to fragile and they fall of, all the time.
Next is the small flagpole. Why would a seaplane, without wheels and therefore without the possibility of landing on land, come with a flagpole, and a gas tank, that sits on a piece of land??? They could easily have made a booey or something instead.
Finaly, the worst thing about the set is, that you have to take the top off completely to get into the cabin. And this flaw goes for most every newer piece of lego city vehicle iv'e seen yet. What happened to the opening roof desing from the good old days? Boy someone really messed up on that one.

Anyway, it's all smaller issues, but it's still sad.

Now, there are also lot's of good things and nice features, and just so you don't think that i'm a complete *sshole, i'd better mention a few of those to. :)

Behind the cabin is actually a small compartment, with opening doors, that can hold the small suitcase that come with the set. The minifig is very nice, and i really really like the new hat, with the rounded shadow. Genious, wish they had that in my time. The model generelly speaking look's excellent, and is actually a good deal bigger than i first expected. It's bigger than the 6673. it's all very sturdy, with the exception of the tail wings, it doesn't fall apart easily, and can be handled by a child, no problem.
It's also a fun build, not very complicated, but still very entertaining.

So, in conclusion, it's still a great set, just not as good as the older models, in my opinion anyway.

I give it a 4/5.

If your lego town is of newer design, you should get this plane without hesitation, but if you have a classic town, i would recommend getting one of the older small planes, like the 6673 Solo Trainer, or the 6687 Turbo Prop.

Damn that ended up being a loooong review, hehe.

"Duq","2010-04-20T05:16:31.92Z","Very swooshable","I really like the design of this little plane, it has a nice 1980's feel to it. Having said that though I'd have changed some details myself.<br><br>First thing I noticed when I opened the box was two booklets. Two? Yes, the pilot and the oil drum have their own booklet; 5 pages on instructions and 6 pages of ads for other sets. Quite unnecessary.<br><br>Building is straightforward as you'd expect from a set marked 5-12. I was surprised by the number of Technic pieces used to attach the pontoons. Clever use of parts. The youngest builders might struggle with the stickers on the tail fin; they're big stickers with little room for error.<br>The weakest part of the design are the engines as there aren't any really. A plate under the wing to hold the propellor and two grille-slopes on top. The colour scheme works well for me. White is a common colour for small airplanes. The yellow is bright and the dark grey striping provides a nice accent.<br>I really like the use of the 3x2 doors to taper the body of the plane at the back. Along with the curved slopes they give the plane a nice shape.<br><br>The parts selection is pretty good; curved slopes including the 10 long ones, grille-slopes, a few wedge plates, the doors...<br><br>All in all a very swooshable little plane. With it's luggage compartment it makes for a great smugglers plane to be chased by police and coast guard.<br><br>At the start I said I'd have made some changes, so here goes: when I built the set I moved the tailplane down to sit underneath the grey plate. That way the the base of the tail fin lines up nicely with the long yellow slopes.<br>Next I would replace the yellow 1x4 plates on the pontoons with grille tiles.<br>Finally as mentioned earlier I'd do something about the engines.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"aplbomr79","2010-01-22T01:28:20.983Z","One of the best...","One of the best for its price.

I was hesitant to purchase this plane.  I actually thought about buying the the Police Helicopter (7741), but I already have a few police themed items.  So I opted to spend an additional dollar for the Seaplane - and I was not disappointed.

There was a lot of thought put into this product.  I like the fact that it has pontoons attached instead of wheels - that way I don't feel the need to have an airport to include it into my city.  This is the only plane released in the CITY theme that has pontoons.  My feeling is that if I do feel the need to make it a ground-lander, I can always add the wheels.

There aren't any unique or new parts, but there are a lot of parts that are not included in most sets.  And they have used many parts to create new features for this model; the most profound is the extra cab space behind the driver that is concealed by double high doors.

One down-fall that is glaring is the color.  It seems that Lego only chooses Yellow, White, and Red for vehicles.  Yes there are a few Orange vehicles, but only in the very recent vehicles.  Can we start to see more Black, Grey, Blue, Brown vehicles?  Maybe a nice chromed out one?


Pros:
-Low Price
-Great use of existing parts
-Fuel tank and windsock
-Sturdy build

Cons
-No wheels to convert into a ground-lander
-Yellow - can we get more colors for the vehicles?

I am VERY happy with this purchase!  I feel that my money was well spent.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"coldcomfort","2011-01-06T16:23:01.547Z","3178 Seaplane - Nothing is better than a truly inventive yet elegantly simple build.","<p>I was in a Kmart today that had these marked down to $6.99 - so I bought both that they had. Frankly, I didn't expect much from this set because it is both very small and very cheap for an airplane. I was very pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the vibrant color of this plane and was impressed at how well it really does resemble a float plane. Furthermore, some of the uses of common parts struck me as innovative (well, I never would have thought to use them like that anyway). As an example take the use of the black 1x2x2 window frames to build the small storage area behind the cockpit. Also, the use of the 1x2x3 doors without framing in the rears of them turned out to be very cool. If I was attempting to design a kit like this I likely would have mucked it up by insisting on framing the doors completely. In short, this is a very well build and creative set that I am very pleased to own.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Incredibly well designed.<br></li><li>Very attractive.<br></li><li>Priced well at $10.99 US.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>This isn't really a con, but rather just an observation: when Lego puts out a set this strong that enjoys pretty wide spread popularity it would be cool if they offered the same design in different colors. I'd like to own, say, three of these in different colors. Another set this idea would work very well for is the 8402 Sports Car.<br></li></ul>

There are 2 instruction booklets which is uncommon in a 10$ set. 1 booklet for the fuel island&nbsp;and 1 for the seaplane.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much to say, you don't get any ""special"" parts from this set.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minifigure, strangely, is a business man with a briefcase and is quiet boring. But, this set introduces the new CURVED hat piece which is cool!</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The build? It is boring except for the beginners. p.s, you might need to be carefull when you are assembling the back part and the pontoons below.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The completed plane supports a yellow and white colour scheme. It is rather fragile because when you throw it but your hand is still holding it, it will break up anyway.....and the fuel island has a windsock and an oil drum.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a really cool set that FLOATS even though LEGO doesn't say that on the box. It is a great addition to anyone's harbour, lake or airport with a lake/river nearby. I give it a 8/10.BrickTVReviews signing off and have a nice day.^_^</p>",TRUE,5,2,3,4,5

It is small, and the seaplane feature is kinda annoying because you can't land it properly.<div>The set is also very fragile, but if you're gentle it won't break.</div><div>Overall a good value for money!</div>",FALSE,3,3,3,3,4
"craigpowers","2011-11-15T23:26:31.52Z","Excellent small plane set and great beginner's set for those new to Lego","<p>I purchased this set in July of 2011 for my young son, whom, I felt was ready to begin building and playing with Legos. &nbsp;Having grown up on Legos myself, I knew that he would get hooked on the concept and that he and I would enjoy something simple like this. &nbsp;What I didn't expect was how well made this model is and how fanatical my son and I would become about acquiring new Lego sets.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Scale/Aesthetics. &nbsp;This is the perfect sized set to represent a private airplane. &nbsp;Although it may be on the small side to be a twin-engine craft, the decision by Lego to make it so by no means hinders the appearance or functionality of the set. &nbsp;The choice to also go with a seaplane theme is outstanding, as there are few examples of such in the Lego catalog and it serves as a nice bridge between the water and airport&nbsp;subgroups&nbsp;within the City theme. &nbsp;The bright yellow color scheme, although unrealistic, works brilliantly with this set as the aircraft is not too big where the color becomes too garish.</li><li>Building experience/Assembly. &nbsp;Although the airplane and accessories go together quickly, it is an entertaining build, nonetheless, as you get to see the airplane grow out of simple angular pieces and a pair of wings. &nbsp;Everything is pieced in a practical manner that allows for quick rebuilding in the event of a ""crash,"" which is a plus in my book, given that my son doesn't have to run to find the instruction manual to put it back together.</li><li>Playability. &nbsp;Once constructed, this set is actually very fun to mess around with. &nbsp;The luggage doors on the airplane are both a brilliant addition and a window to many possibilities (is it a business plane, a life flight, or just a weekend getaway machine?). &nbsp;The wind sock and fuel tank just add to imagination and serve as the gears that keep a running storyline going when you're in full play-mode.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I have yet to find anything wrong with this set. &nbsp;The stickers are few in number and the plane works just fine without them (I did not put the stickers on right away, waiting to find out how my son treated his Legos, but have since applied them and they add a nice, subtle touch to the model).</li></ul>
<p>Given the size and the relative ease of assembly, this is a great beginner's set, especially if you have an airplane enthusiast at home. &nbsp;Also, having been well-designed to mimic a real aircraft, it is a model that ""matures"" with the builder and looks serious enough even for older Lego builders to appreciate it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"wii1232","2013-07-29T22:15:32.823Z","Great Gift","I received this set as a gift from my friend at my 10th birthday party. &nbsp;When I looked at the box, I thought that it was going to be not that fun. &nbsp;But when I opened it and built it, my opinion changed.",FALSE,5,4,5,3,5
"Mlyneck","2017-07-11T19:08:34.813Z","A very elegant small set :)","<p>I&#39;ve bought this set in a bundle for a very cheap price. I haven&#39;t expected much, but I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p><strong>Minifig:</strong></p>

<p>Probably the most boring part of the set. Plain shirt and overused headpiece. Nothing more to say.</p>

<p><strong>Main Build:</strong></p>

<p>The seaplane was pretty easy to build which makes it a very good starter set. However, this doesn&#39;t make it by any means uninteresting as it very well designed. Interesting construction, good scale, and vibrant colors make this set a good one to put on a display. It has also a pretty neat trick where the locker doors are in line with plane silhouette making it look smoother.</p>

<p><strong>Additions:</strong></p>

<p>Again, not much to say, small fuel barrel and windsock. Better this, than nothing, I guess.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Nothing special, but overall, a very good choice of parts for a set of this type.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong></p>

<p>A very neat set&nbsp; :)</p>

"Master_Wu","2019-03-19T23:34:46.443Z","Let's Get Flying!","<p>This set is an amazingly fun vehicle to play with. The cockpit space fits the one minifigure included and gives him plenty of room to sit in. The roof pops off very easily to get the pilot in quickly. there is also a nice luggage&nbsp;compartment in the back where his suitcase is stored. The side build, which is the gas tank and flag&nbsp;is good too. The gas tank comes off and you can pretend to fill up the plane&#39;s tank.</p>

<p>Overall this set is good for parts, money, build, AND play! I highly recommend&nbsp;it!</p>

"TheCollector43","2020-05-12T21:29:15.57Z","Fantastic","<p>This set os a great set. The figure has some good prints on the torso but nothing else really special about him. The plane however is a good sturdy plane but the pontoons can easily fall off. If you put the pontoons on backwards it will want to tip backwards so follow to instructions carefully. Over all I give it an 8/10</p>

"bricksofcanada","2021-02-21T16:04:27.453Z","Everything in one","<p>I personally enjoy this set as my grandfather owned a seaplane highly similar to this one. i say its everything in one because of how it combines a toy with a model, if you look up seaplane, you&#39;ll be suprised to find how well this set compares to the real thing. i could display this with my model (not lego) plane collection. anyway, i am very impressed with this set and give it five stars.</p>
