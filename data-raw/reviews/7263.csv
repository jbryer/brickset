"LegoCoastalPatrol","2010-01-05T13:07:15.653Z","City Lighting Repair Truck…","This was the second set which I ordered from Lego.com on the 30.12.09 and it arrived today (05.01.10).   this was another set which was on my ‘wish list’ when the 2010 sets became apparent and I am glad I ordered it when I did as I haven’t seen any of these in any shops … yet.   The set took around 20 minutes to complete, it was a pleasant and easy build.   The set has two main parts:

The Streetlight:

The streetlight is very similar to those seen in the City Corner set; it is of a simple, modern design.   The streetlight is mounted on a cream base and is of a two tone grey colour scheme with the adjustable head where the light is mounted.   Also supplied is a green dustbin.   Is this the recycle point for the neighbourhood?

The Service Truck:

The truck is a welcome departure from the traditional fire and police lines which seem to dominate every new release year from Lego.   The truck is of a very manageable size, so it would navigate the majority of street layouts and would fit in, scale-wise perfectly.   The truck is of a ‘6 brick’ width which follows other trucks in more recent years.   The truck is decorated in a bright yellow colour scheme combined with grey wheel arches and detailing.   The truck features a grey front bumper and grill complete with headlights and number plate.   There is a sloping bonnet, yellow doors and grey-tinted windscreen.   The sides of the cab are also yellow and feature the ‘electricity’ graphic.   The roof is also yellow and features a bar with amber warning lights and vent.   The rear of the truck is the real work zone.   On the right hand side, two lockers are provided which can house the various tools (provided) and spare lamps along with brackets to hold more equipment.   On the left hand side of the rear area is a tread plate and the all-important crane arrangement with inspection bucket attached.   The crane lifts and swivels so that various repairs can be carried out on a variety of lights in various locations.  The bucket is white and houses the supplied minifig (when he isn’t driving to the work zone).   There are also two white barriers decorated with amber beacons, there are stored close to the bucket when it is in secured-for-transport mode.   The minifig supplied with the set wears a red hardhat and glasses along with work wear comprising of an orange high-visibility vest and blue trousers.

This truck adds a lot to recreating a scene of everyday life in a town, and complements the other subthemes as well.  For instance, an errant lego driver could always take out a light pole and this would fit well with the fire, medic, and police units at the scene.

"AETerry","2010-09-07T17:19:27.68Z","Repair Truck Review","<p>This is a fairly decent set in the small to mid-size level range that went for about $12.99 when it came out. I've only a couple of other Utility type vehicles for my Town/City collection and I liked this one as an updated model.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are in booklet form following LEGO's clear step-by-step illustrations and a parts list at the end for those needing to replace pieces.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 118 pieces in this set, making it feel it is very much so worth the price. Notable pieces are the ""man bucket"" piece, green trashcan, new minifigure tools and the pieces for making a street light.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Only one minifigure comes in this set, that of a construction/city work with glasses.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>What I liked best about this solid little utility truck model is the inclusion of the ""man bucket"" for the utility work to stand in as he is lifted upwards to work either on telephone wire poles or fix a lighting fixture in a LEGO City.</p><p>While it can be argued that the Street Light and Green Trashcan are possibly after thoughts on LEGO's part, they're good add-ons to provide the City Utility Worker something to do with fixing a light and the pieces themselves can be added anywhere in a LEGO City or Town, adding details and character to it.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div class=""description"">If you collect City/Town, this is a good little set to consider as it's modestly priced and it helps to expand on and away from the numerous Emergency Vehicles that LEGO does seem to cycle out every few years for the new Collectors coming into the fold.<br><br><p>From the view point of someone who's got a lot of City/Town and has been working to fill it out more, this is a great, if not perfect addition.</p></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4

"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-27T15:30:29.793Z","He'll light up your life.","Pick any fanbase you can think of, and you can probably think of some kind of debate that somehow polarises the community into two warring factions. Whether its deciding if Greedo shot first or if Thor could beat the Hulk, bringing up any of these old chestnuts is sure to attract the ire of die-hards who strongly hold to one opinion or another.<div><br></div><div>Of course, the AFOL community is far too sophisticated to stoop to that level of mud-slinging over a trivial matter, right? After all, what wounds could possibly reopen from bringing up something as innocent as City vehicles being four studs wide as they were before or six studs wide, as many of them are now?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I hope I don't rekindle any blood feuds just by bringing that up; truth be told, I don't even know if ""four vs six studs for vehicles"" is an actual thing or not. I guess what I'm really trying to say is that <i>if</i> there is such an argument, then Repair Truck could possibly be put forth as an example where six studs wide seems just a little, well, fat.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Repair Truck has all the standard trappings of a small-but-not-impulse City set. It's got a lone Minifig, our streetlight specialist, who isn't exactly mind-blowing-ly unique, although he does have a head with glasses on, which I always like. Of course, the truck is the main build, and you also get a streetlight as a secondary build, which is a thoughtful addition that can easily be integrated into your own town display (although its colour scheme, oddly enough, is different from the ones in City Corner (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7641-1"">7641</a>) and City House (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=8403-1"">8403</a>), not that it's offensive enough to be noticeable).</div><div><br></div><div>The titular repair truck has just about all of the usual features that one should come to expect with contemporary City road vehicles: a pair of SNOT pieces that give the front and back of the truck a lot of tasteful realism, a ""cover"" piece that pops open easily to allow placement and extraction of the Minifig from the truck, and a plethora of annoying stickers; thankfully, most of the stickers are all small and easily applied here, so it shouldn't be an issue. As a bonus, Repair Truck actually has those little doors that open, which is sort of an optional feature in vehicles nowadays.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The main gimmick and point of interest for Repair Truck is arguably the crane/cradle mechanism that allows our electrician to reach and replace the streetlight bulbs. It's a simple design that works very well and actually allows for a surprising amount of movement. It's a really cool detail that will give your town a great sense of ""busyness"" when set up (or perhaps some kid might actually want to play with it, how about that?). However, this simple set up is, tellingly, accomplished well within four studs, and the extra two studs that give the truck its, er, girth are used as storage space for the repairman's tools and spare light bulbs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Does the truck look unsightly with this added width? Could the truck be modified to be two studs thinner? The former is strictly a matter of opinion, while I'm sure the answer to the second question is yes. I guess there is an argument to be made for ensuring that trucks appear visually larger than cars, which still adhere strictly to the four stud rule. I think Repair Truck looks fine as it is, and I'm certainly not at all sorry to have it. If you think it could use a bit of slimming down, then I'm sure that could be easily accomplished. However, for my part, I will say that Repair Truck is a great little set for injecting some life into your fledgling city, and is therefore valuable for that reason.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"bricksan","2012-06-17T12:18:08.507Z","3179 Repair Truck","<div>Time for my biggest review to date. You can see from the images in the gallery below that this set is not a small set. &nbsp;I photographed the build every 3 stages, to give you a clear idea of how the set is built. &nbsp;The City set I am reviewing today is 3179 Repair Truck and you can still buy this from all good retailers.</div><div><br></div><div>The RRP is £9.99 and with it being out now for two years you can pick it up for a few pound less. At Smyths you can get it as part of their two for £15 deal. I bought mine from Asda for only £7.99 which is a bargain.</div><div><br></div><h4>Introduction</h4><div><br></div><div>The set was released in 2010 and you get one piece to every 8p you spend on the set, if you buy it at RRP price. The set comes in two bags with two large plates put in loose inside the box. This set also comes with a sticker sheet on it, on the sheet you get 9 stickers on it. I am rubbish at putting stickers on, so I roped in my wife to add the stickers. It is worth mentioning this was the first set I bought that required stickers as back in the 80's and early 90's stickers on LEGO sets just did not happen.</div><div><br></div><div>Now people are split on the subject of stickers, I for one love them, they add character and seem to complete a set, while at the same time they help LEGO keep the cost down. Also here is a bit of news for you, on the license plates the two letters are the initials of the designer who designed the set.</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions booklet is A5 in size, the inside cover warns you not to put LEGO on the carpet but on a table instead and to sort them. At the back you have adverts for the LEGO Club as well as images of the fire layout out and airport layout as well as the parts list that is now common place inside all instructions booklets.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div><br></div><div>To start with you are tasked to construct the minifigure that also appeared in 7633 Constructions Site from 2009, so it’s not a rare minifigure. I am still unsure if I like the orange jacket or not but as a whole it is a nice minifigure. After this you build the street light that comes with it. Now I love the street light and is a major feature on my City project, with the idea coming from this set.</div><div><br></div><div>It is a pretty easy build but the finished light looks spot on, you also get a green trash can (why?) and it is on a sand coloured plate, not sure why this colour. For me it is the colour of sand in LEGO and think it would have been better being light bluish gray instead. However the plate has been used as has the light in my City project.</div><div><br></div><div>Moving on stage 1-3 is building the axle of the truck nothing too plexing at this stage. 4-7 you begin building the cab, all rather straight forward with all stages requiring no more than 3 parts adding to the build. 9 through to 12 carries on the cab build and also you add the back wheel archers. Stage 13 requires the front number plate sticker to be added, along with the grill and lights. The effect looks really good ( I took a close up of the front). &nbsp;14 and 15 see you add the bonnet and doors to the cab. Stage 16 sees another sticker added this time it is the back bumper and lights. Again the overall look is very effect with little bricks used to get this effect.</div><div><br></div><div>Stages 17 – 24 &nbsp;sees you completed the cab section, you also have two more stickers to add either side of the cab and you also add the cherry picker holder as well. Stages 25 to 32 see you add the back of the truck, this includes the tool holders, two storage boxes and also the cherry picker type lift. These stages you also put another 5 stickers on to the truck, as well as all the tools on to it. &nbsp;The last stage sees you add the wheels.</div><div><br></div><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><div><br></div><div>The build is not hard but is a fun one. The finished truck is still one of my favourites, I like the cherry picker lift at the back and all the cool tools you get in &nbsp;it as well, overall it is well worth spending £10, the stickers are awkward to add but take your time as the effects of the stickers complete the look of the truck.</div><div><br></div><div>The only thing I would have changed is the plate for the street light and also added a proper seat to the cab as it seems lacking without one. If you are a fan of City sets this is a most buy, it appeals to the age range it is intended for and it’s also one that is fun to build and also very playable once built.</div><div><br></div><div>Review on my site:&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/3179-repair-truck/"">http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/3179-repair-truck/</a></div><div>Images on flickr:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157630161733162/with/7387170770/"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157630161733162/with/7387170770/</a></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

It&#39;s based off of a cherrypicker design and has 1 truck and a small lamp post side build.</p>

<p>The truck itself is a standard design and does little to stand out with the exception of it&#39;s bright colour to stand out, and that&#39;s the beauty of it. The chassis is basic and has an inverted slope based structure with a flatbed base. The cab is spacious enough for the 1 figure in the set however the standard model doesn&#39;t have space for any more figures, however, it would be simple enough to change the interior to seat 2 using jumper plates.</p>

<p>The back section has a light grey crane which uses ratcheted hinge bricks which gives a good degree of articulation and has black and yellow diagonal stripes which are on stickers. When not up, the crane arm can fold down effortlessly for driving mode.There are also a pair of barriers which have small lights on top. They are used well and take up a space which couldn&#39;t fit a lot of parts however, when off the truck, they can greatly increase the volume of the set and increase the playability. The truck also holds a full ring of small tools, stored in cabinets and clips on the side.</p>

<p>The side build sits on a 4x4 tan plate, however I don&#39;t think that this is the correct colour, when in combination with the dark grey base for the lamp post, due to the contrast between the urban lamp post and bin with the sandy looking surface. This may have worked better if it were a tiled surface, representing the pavement surface. The lamp post build is simple, however it works well and has a plate to represent the light which can be easily changed out to represent the light being fixed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figure is simple and just has 4 common pieces, and the is worth very little, however does what is needed for the set to work.</p>

<p>Overall this is a great set, especially at such a low price point, and can be bought for cheaper on the second hand market in some cases being able to buy for under &pound;5 at car boot sales in the UK. The set itself is well worth the money as it also includes a variety of exciting and useful parts, especially for a set of this size.</p>

The lamp post build is admittedly a little pathetic and the model isn&#39;t as smooth as a modern day version would be, but it still manages to outperform 90% of modern city sets in both value and appearance. The crane is a lot of fun to play around with and the sticker details add a lot without being too obnoxious. The figure included is fine, the draw of city isn&#39;t the figures and never was. Overall, a nice little set that adds a lot to a city build and is one of the better city vehicles ever made.&nbsp;</p>
