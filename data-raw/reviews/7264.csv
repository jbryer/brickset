"LegoCoastalPatrol","2010-01-05T13:08:16.45Z","Octan Goes Strong, Even in 2010…","This was the first of the 2010 sets which I added to my wish list at the end of 2009.   I ordered this from Lego.com on 30.12.09 and it arrived today (05.01.10).   I spent a very pleasant 45 minutes building this while the snow fell outside, I really enjoyed building both the tractor unit and the tanker-trailer, not to mention the additional fuel pump which is also supplied with this set.   I have split my review into three parts:

The Fuel Pump and Truck Driver:

I hadn’t actually noticed the provision of a fuel pump when I ordered this from Lego.com, so I was quite surprised when the first part of the manual described how this was to be ‘assembled’.   The fuel pump is a welcome addition, especially if like me; you don’t have too many filling stations in your town / city.   The fuel pump is mounted on a small light grey base; the actual fuel pump follows the traditional Octan colour scheme (white, red and green).   The pump structure features a pay-at-pump facility, presumably for credit card payments and to eliminate the need for a pay kiosk.   Current prices are also displayed on the pump structure; there is also the pipe and nozzle arrangement.   On the side of the base is the refuelling point which marries up to the nozzle on the tanker-trailer.   The truck driver minifig looks smart in white trousers, a blue Octan jacket and baseball cap with high peak.   He’s obviously happy in his job and he wears a wide smile.

The Tractor Unit:

I have to admit that I was expecting the tractor unit to be pretty mundane and similar if not the same as previous articulated truck sets, and although this tractor unit does follow a similar design it is slightly different and in some ways, a little more detailed.   The front grille features a new bracket which ensures that the grille is attached to the chassis as well as the underside of the tinted windscreen; this makes the whole assembly feel a lot more secure than similar designs on previous sets.   The cab follows the traditional Octan colour scheme and comes complete with opening doors in green, the Octan logo on the cab sides and roof, gear lever and coffee cup.   There are also high-mounted amber beacons and white, adjustable wing mirrors.   The rear section features tread plates, fuel tanks and also air-hoses / fuel lines.   The mounting bracket to enable trailer hook-up is in black and allows for a smooth connection due to the provision of smooth vents around this area.   There is a rear number plate with lights attached.

The Tanker Trailer:

The other half of the truck is just as appealing as the tractor unit and follows the same clean colour scheme.   A storage locker and refuelling pipe arrangement are attached to the chassis along with a lever and indicator gauge.   The rear wheel arches match the same colour scheme as the tractor unit (white) and enable a two-axle arrangement.   There is also a kingpin for coupling to the tractor unit and the provision of an undercarriage.   This allows the trailer to be free-standing after the tractor unit has been detached.   Amber beacons are fitted to the feet of the undercarriage.   The actual fuel tank is made up of just six parts to make the circular ‘tank’ design which becomes apparent during construction.   The tank is again in Octan colours and features various graphics.   The top of the tank features circular points for filling back at the depot.   A black ladder is also provided for roof access, and lower down is a rear number plate and brake / indicator lights.

Overall an outstanding set, I hope this is going to set the trend for 2010, if so, the Lego design team have set themselves a challenge and a half trying to better this…",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"blocktron","2010-02-15T16:52:47.2Z","A tanker for the new Lego City","<p>So I finally picked up this tanker at the weekend. I'd added it to my wish list when the first out of focus scans hit the net last year. It's perfectly sized for the new lego city dimensions and gives that chunky look that most of us should be familiar with being stuck behind on the side roads.</p>
<p>Overall it's a great model, the build was enjoyable, though with the tank being basically 6 pieces of airplane / train body doesn't take all that long. It looks particularly well with the colour scheme carried from the truck all the way trough to the trailer.</p>
<p>Plus Points</p>
<ul>
    <li>New front grill chasis makes this cab much stronger than previous 6 stud trucks.</li>
    <li>Side storage area with wheel stop and hose.</li>
    <li>Ladder up the back area, both attractive and hides the stud holes.</li>
    <li>Stabalisers - means you can have a few trailers parked up on your layout for a realistic depot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Minus</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stickers, not my style but I'll forgive.</li>
    <li>Hitch - The trailer looks gangly in comparison to truck, it's too far from the body.</li>
    <li>Wheel arches - the trucks rear wheel set have no wheel arches. This isn't normal for trucks this size and while I can see the issue getting the wheel arch in place while keeping the trailer free moving but it's bugging me</li>
</ul>
<p>For those that want to add a bit more:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Move the blue trailer pin in one hole, you won't believe how much better it looks and it doesn't affect movement of the trailer.</li>
    <li>Figure out a way to place a wheel arch on the back wheels (it's possible but you'll sacrifice about 1 plate height on the trailer.</li>
    <li>Wire up the emergency lights on the roof - not for the faint hearted you'll be drilling precious lego.</li>
    <li>Amend the stabaliser to have wheels instead of a plate.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, some faults but nothing to outweight the 17eur I paid for it. Plus the petrol pumps are a nice touch.</p>

"Krogh","2010-04-28T19:50:30.17Z","Top of the Pop.","<p>Alright, so i know it has been some time since my last review, and i wan't to thank all the users that has contacted me on my email, much appreciated. :) Unfortunatly, it might be some time before my next review to, i imagine it will be the <a title=""View full details of set 3221: LEGO Truck"" href=""../../detail/?Set=3221-1""><strong><FONT color=#51abff size=2>3221</FONT></strong></a> Lego Truck once it comes out. :) Anyway, on with the review. Let's look at the individual parts of the set.<br/><br/><strong>Small gas station and minifig:</strong></p>
<p>This small gas station is great on sooo many levels. It fits perfectly in the <a title=""View full details of set 7993: Service Station"" href=""../detail/?Set=7993-1""><strong><FONT color=#4667a4 size=2>7993</FONT></strong></a>
<SCRIPT type=text/javascript>$().ready(function() { $('#b5612').jqm({ ajax: '/ajax/getInstructions.aspx?SetID=5612', trigger: '#c5612' }); });</SCRIPT>
 Service station layout (i placed it here since, to my knowledge, no real life city would have a small seperated station in the middle of the street).</p>
<p>The small station features a keypad, a display, and a hose with a nosle on it. The only complaint i have is, that the hose comes of way to easy. The perhaps most important function of this part, is that it gives the rest of the set a purpose. If your city does not have a gas or service station, why buy a tanker truck? Well Lego goes one step beyond, by giving you a small gas station included in the set! Excellent!</p>
<p>Last thing to talk about is the build. Really not much to say, very simple, but it ads endless playability, to an otherwise pretty pointless set (if you have no service or gas station anyway).</p>
<p>The minifig is fairly standard, with a simple smiling face, wich i like, i don't really care for sunglasses and a smug face. It comes with the new cap, and i simply love this! (as i may have mentioned&nbsp;in some other reviews)&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tractor cab:</strong></p>
<p>Now this is where the set truely shines! The cab is a much improved version of the ""older"" city trucks. Improvements include: A new piece for the front, wich is&nbsp;also connected to the windshield of the truck (old models were only connected to a few studs on the front), this improves the stability of the front, and that is a very nice thing. Another improvement over the older trucks is, that it actually has a window in the back of the cab, instead of just being open, as some of the older models are. Perhaps the best improvement (for me anyway), is the hookups for brakes, and control lines to the trailer (these are the red and yellow nosles on the back of the cab), this ads so much realism to the cab. As i have mentioned before i am a truck driver by livelyhood, so that detail really was a huge improvement in my eyes! :)</p>
<p>The roof is easily removable for acces to the inside of the cabin. The inside now features a gear lever, wich i don't think any of the older trucks have. Finally, it also houses a coffee mug, and this&nbsp;is a MUST have, for any real truckers out there. :)</p>
<p>The build is faily similar to the older trucks, but with a few minor changes. It is a fun build, not very complicated, and the finished product is very stable, and has the potential for hours upon hours&nbsp;of playtime.</p>
<p>The new details makes this much more realistic than other lego trucks, and in my opinion, that is a huge plus! Good job Lego! :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trailer:</strong></p>
<p>Once again we have a fairly realistic trailer, but with a few disapointments. Over all it looks very nice, and as with the cab, it has some very realistic features. It has supportlegs, for use when it is not connected to the cab. It has a cabinet on the right side,&nbsp;that holds 2 stop ""blocks"" (you know, to put in front of the wheels so the trailer wont roll away, I&nbsp;don't know the correct english word for them). On the left side it has a hose, with a nosle. There are also a lever to operate the hose, and a gage that shows how much fuel the trailer holds (that's what it shows in my city anyway).</p>
<p>Now we have worked our way to the back of the trailer, and here is where i have a complaint. On the backside, there is a ladder. A nice detail, only problem is, that it's to long. It hangs down in front of the lights, and the license plate. Oh well, guess the designers had a brain fart there. Nonetheless, this bothered me, and i tried to solve it. At first i thought about physically cutting the bottom step of the ladder to shorten it, but i didn't want to ruin the piece. So what i did was, i simply turned the rear bumper upside down, thereby lowering the lights and licenseplate by the required one stud. :)</p>
<p>Finally, the build. Unfortunatly the tank itself is built out of pieces so big, that it ends up shortening the buildtime considerably. The bottom half of the trailer took me a few minutes, the top half, a few seconds, and as a result my ""building fix"" was not satisfied. Anyway, overall a very good trailer to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my final thughts. This truck is certainly a step in the right direction, i would like more of this. Any complaints i might have had to this set, is nitpicking. It is very nearly perfect, and as such, i give it a very strong 4/5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally i would like to leave the Lego designers a small suggestion. I think that the farm sets need a milk truck. At least, that is what it would take for me to start buying them, hehe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, best regards.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,5
"Firox_5000","2010-05-30T07:48:29.077Z","Best value city set since the fire truck","<p>I bought this at argos with 20% off only costing £11.99 . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any the set itself is the best value set I have seen in the £13-£15 price range since the 2005 Fire truck even at £15 . Any the set has quite a lot of pieces around 221 which is a really good amount of pieces&nbsp; and the build takes probably around 25-40 minutes . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set itself is very nicely designed and has a nice front tender with detail . It is sturdier than similar sets in the past e.g cargo truck and recycle truck .The fuel container at the back looks very nice and it is good to see Octan are still around . The design is simple but good for what it is . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set also includes a small pump which&nbsp; doesn;t do much but adds a little extra things in to the set . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comparing this set to the 2005 fire truck in length it is slightly longer and for a £1 and the pump would probably be even value I would say . Overall a very good set which all lego needs to do now is do a rerelease in a more improoved Petrol station . </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"tomahawker","2010-07-07T16:36:30.437Z","Putting Out the Fire With Gasoline","<p>It's been some time since I have built a new set, and when I saw this one on sale at ToysRUs, I felt compelled to get it and build something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The set comes with two large parts bags - one for the cab section, and one for the tanker section, plus 3 green pieces for the bottom of the tanker loose in the box.&nbsp; The sticker sheet is reasonable for a set of this size, consisting mostly of Octan logos, plus some diamond-plate steps for the fuel tanks of the cab, and a couple of stickers for a small gas pump.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The small standalone gas pump is for me somewhat of a throwaway, although I expect it increases playability for younger builders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The truck cab goes together easily, and the finished item is very sturdy, with little in the way of loose parts to knock off.&nbsp; The front grille looks very authentic, and takes up only one brick width at the front of the cab, thanks to a new plate with studs on 4 sides.&nbsp; Side mirrors add to the visual appeal of the exterior.&nbsp; The inside of the cabin includes a minifig seat, steering wheel, shift lever, and coffee cup, making it one of the most detailed interiors I have seen in a set of this size.&nbsp; Behind the cabin are hookups for air lines as well as a simulated fifth wheel for attaching the tanker.&nbsp; The driver minifig is pretty standard, with a fairly common Octan jacket and a blue ballcap (the new style with the curved brim).&nbsp; He fits into the cabin easily via the removable roof, and is very visible through the front windshield, as well as through the thoughtfully included rear window.&nbsp; Another nice addition is the use of opening vehicle doors, something that has been missing on previous City releases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The tanker trailer also assembles easily, and fortunately the chassis isn't based on any large single-use pieces.&nbsp; The curved 8 x 6 x 2 slope pieces used to form the tanker section are ideal for this purpose and make a very visually appealing curved shape.&nbsp; In addition, the construction is very stable with these pieces, and doesn't feel fragile when handling.&nbsp; The color scheme is vibrant, and is achieved without the need for large stickers.&nbsp; The tanker base contains a cabinet with yellow wheel chocks - a nice and unexpected touch.&nbsp; A control lever and gauge add to the realism. The base also contains a hose reel and a generous length of cord with attached nozzle.&nbsp; My only quibble would be the lack of a clip for the nozzle, as it tends to dangle awkwardly.&nbsp; The tanker trailer also includes a ladder at the back, and folding &quot;landing gear&quot; for when the trailer is detached from the cab.&nbsp; The trailer attaches via a technic axle pin.&nbsp; As others have pointed out, the look is improved by moving the pin back one hole in the trailer to close the gap between the trailer and cab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The completed set looks striking, and from a few feet away it's hard to recognize it as a Lego construction.&nbsp; Drivability is typical for a vehicle of this size - not great due to lack of any steered wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all, it's a great addition to any Lego Town or City collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pros:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Very eye-catching color scheme achieved with minimal stickers</li>
    <li>Lots of details and playable features</li>
    <li>Final construction is very sturdy</li>

It definitely not the smartest choice for him, since he will get the pants dirty in a really short time. But this is not a major problem, not many people will aware of this (maybe I am thinking too much:P), and it can really fixed easily by replacing the pants with other color.<br><br><br>In conclusion, I think this is among the best set that Lego launched for the City theme on 2010, and if you are a real city builder, I believe you should have at least one in your collection.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

But the build is simple, and you should be able to complete it quickly, and a child could do it with almost no help. <br><br>Finished model.<br>I have to say! This model has a few cool features to play around with, and looks very stylish in your city. Yes, there are stickers, but seeing as lego is making no move to make printed peices, lets just deal with them, or maybe even learn to like them. Some of them include detaching the tank from the cab, and having a cool stand that folds out from under the tank. It also comes with TWO count em, TWO double cheesers! And they are actually yellow. On either side of the vechile there is a small cabinet to store the 2x2 sloped peices (cheesers) and on the other side is a hose and rope, pre-assmbled so no fidling with tying a knot on the hose/gun peice.

It's a very interesting build, the model is incredibly durable, the minifigure has a nice uniform and, best of all, it is branded with City's own decal 'Octan' - the fictional energy company. Not forgetting the lovely details and attention to real life features (even as far as the chocks to stop the tank-trailer moving), it should make a perfect addition to anyones collection. I even liked the fact the box from the packaging was nicely sized for this price point, as when you start hitting the twenties, they tend to double in size as if to reenforce the value/size of the product.<br><br>Two minor set-backs reduce the product to a 4 star rating in my opinion. Firstly, the rear license plate sticker on the cab is, according to the manual, supposed to be placed on a 2 x 1 flat tile above row of studs on the back of the of the model. In this position, the license plate cannot be seen because it is obstructed by the ladder. However, on the back of the box and the promotional photographs in the manual, the sticker is placed on that lowest line of studs where it can be seen properly below the ladder. It's unusual for the Lego group to make such annoying continuity errors as these stickers can't be removed.<br><br>Also, one of my bricks was the wrong colour. This wasn't too much of a problem as the one is question is well hidden, but it suggests some quality control issues when other reviewers have had similar experiences.<br><br>In short however, this is a well priced vehicle that does without too many special components and focuses on classic Lego building. Grab it while you can!</span>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,5

"Harmonious_Building","2011-10-21T21:17:25.98Z","Truckin' awesome. ","In the strange alternate universe of LEGO System, global oil and gas giant Royal Dutch Shell has been supplanted by a young upstart by the name of Octan, to the point where the former multi-billion-dollar company was forced out of existence by its green-and-red rival. LEGO loves Big Oil almost as much as it loves police surveillance (what message are we sending to our children, exactly?), and its love is demonstrated once again with the mighty Tank Truck, a truly formidable unit in the world of petroleum conglomerates.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>In all honesty, I bought this set completely on a whim, my rationale being something along the lines of, hey, wouldn't it be sweet to own a truck since I've never owned one in my life? I have been told that I was fascinated by large vehicles as a child, and although I thought that that enthusiasm had waned since then, it turns out that there is some primal part of me that loves large vehicles still because I think Tank Truck is among the coolest vehicles I own.</div><div><br></div><div>The Tank Truck comes with just one Minifig, a lowly Octan underling whose uniform is the same after all these years; it so happens that I still have the Minifig from 6537 - circa 1994, according to BrickSet - and his uniform is identical to this guy's. One Minifig is all you'll need for this set, which comes with a surprising number of features in spite of being, well, a truck.</div><div><br></div><div>The front part of a truck (are there technical terms that differentiate between the actual part of the truck that has the engine in it versus the stuff that it pulls along?) looks absolutely fantastic, and the ingenuity of LEGO engineers never fails to amaze and impress me no matter how many vehicles I build. The level of detail is amazing, and, like most other LEGO vehicles these days, the roof comes off for easy placement of the Minifig.</div><div><br></div><div>The oil tank itself is detachable and made out of large curved pieces, which add an elegant sense of realism to the truck. The pieces are not attached together firmly, which makes blowing it up a breeze if you happen to be staging an alien invasion or recreating the opening scene from Fast &amp; Furious, although doing that, unfortunately, requires you to acknowledge that the movie Fast &amp; Furious exists. Worse still, you may find yourself in a position where you are forced to admit to yourself that, yes, you have seen Fast &amp; Furious and should be ashamed for it (I know I am). That aside, the tanker also comes with a number of great features for playability, including a long rope ""pipe"" with a nozzle and a pair of chocks for preventing the vehicle from rolling away.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, as a small bonus, the set also comes with a gas pump, which will have to satisfy most of us in terms of keeping our cars on the go since the Service Station (7993) is inexplicably rare and prohibitively expensive. Pairing it up with a makeshift structure is not an entirely bad idea for creating a rudimentary gas/petrol station of your own for your city.</div><div><br></div><div>The Tank Truck has quickly become the centrepiece of my town and one of my favourite sets, and this is coming from someone who, prior to his impulse purchase, had no great affinity for trucks. So go ahead and support Big Oil - my guess is that Octan will simply use your money to keep creating policemen until the ratio of law enforcement personnel to civilians stands at roughly 1:2.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"craigpowers","2011-11-19T11:57:49.43Z","Another beautiful offering from the geniuses at Lego","<p>Like many others who have commented on this site, I am really loving the direction Lego has taken toward their city vehicles in the last half-decade, especially the trucks and cars. &nbsp;Where, before, most of Lego's vehicles were tiny, clown-car like submissions that did not represent anything close to a realistic vehicle, the new six-wide offerings are both appealing and a very much needed step towards bringing a touch of realism to any City collection. &nbsp;This Tank Truck is no exception and is a gorgeous and very functional set, too.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Color Scheme/Aesthetics. &nbsp;The strong green, red, and white colors make the vehicle a very striking piece that really stands out on its own. &nbsp;Although the tractor cab is very similar in build to other trucks in the City line, it is nonetheless a well-assembled, appealing truck.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>This is a more of a personal thing than any real problem with the set, but the connector used to attach the trailer to the tractor merely just allows that trailer to ""sit"" in place, rather than snap into position. &nbsp;I traded out the piece with a peg to resolve this.</li></ul>
<p>All in all, this is a fantastic set, especially at the MSRP and is a highly recommended piece to add to any city collection.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"legoboy1999","2011-08-22T14:52:02.893Z","City Review of 3180 Tank Truck","<p>This is a review of City set 3180 Octan Tank Truck. It comes with one minifigure,a fuel pump and the tank truck.The minifiure is a Octan truck driver with the new curved baseball cap in blue,face with eyebrows and a smile and Octan jacket with white pants and the fuel pump is a simple build in a place to put gas from the truck in and a sticker for the gallons and the price.</p>
<p>The tank truck,the main part of set,is an articulated truck with the&nbsp;cab is a European style front with lights on top as it being an airport vehicle,the planes need to see it to know not to land on a tank truck.(That would be very bad)The interior has a steering wheel,a lever and a coffee cup and on the back there`s some things that might be wires but look like ketchup and mustard dispensers.</p>
<p>The trailer is made out of the container,which is like&nbsp;11 pieces and has holes in it. I don`t trust container tanks with holes in them. There`s also wheel chocks on one side and oil delivery controls on the other.A ladder to get to the top and a stand.</p>
<p>In short,this is a great use of 20 bucks,I advise you to buy this and buy it before it runs out!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"NYC231","2014-03-24T21:53:57.847Z","Good LEGO Set","<p>I hope my review is of assistance to you!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is an average sized City box, so not to big and not to small just about the right size for the product. The instructions were fairly simple to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This isn&#39;t a huge set, so you get some rare-ish&nbsp;parts like the pieces for the actual fuel tank trailer, but most pieces are just average parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes one minifigure;</p>

<p>- An Octan&nbsp;male worker</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build didn&#39;t take me too long, maybe 30 - 45 minutes to fully assemble this set. This product is just like any other City sets for the most part in terms of the building process.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a nice piece, although it&#39;s probably going to be used more for play than display. The playability is increased through the little gas tank that could be used to fill up a LEGO car. The little gas tank can be &quot;filled&quot; up by the big gas tank&#39;s fuel line that has a nozzle on the end.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set, overall, is a nice little set. Like I said before, this set is probably more for play than display. I hope LEGO comes out with a new version of the old gas station so that collectors have a reason to buy this product. In the mean time, this set will &quot;fuel&quot; the imagination of tomorrow&#39;s builders!</p>
