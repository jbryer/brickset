Initial findings:

58cm (l) x 48cm (h) x 9cm (w)
1983 grams - Total
431 grams - Box Only

Pieces ?? (Need to count as it again doesnt say on the box! - Do that later)

When opening the box DO NOT open both sides! Just open one side only as all items will fall out both ways if you open them both sides!

so far the plane is larger than the 3181 plane.
Measuring in at 52cm long and 45cm long wing span.

Very easy to build. This time it has more interior than the 3181 plane, even has a split first class and economy section.
The two engines used real lego propeller shapes which was good. Cockpit looks roomy, despite having the main center console being a sticker. (Kinda sucked as the side panels were imprinted).
The front sliding door was definitely interesting, it replicated a real planes method of closing (if you have ever seen a plane shut, it is the same).

What I found annoying was the why did lego only give two engines? There is room for 2 pairs or even 3 pairs of engines. Even has the grooves there.
The wing lacked detail in my opinion, could have done more with it.
No landing gear that is retractable but I guess this is not a technic set so it shouldnt be moveable.

The front of the plane looks really good like an actual 747 plane.
The tail to my surprise did NOT have a sticker as it was imprinted on! :o I was going to turn it into a QANTAS plane but no go now. :(

The rear was just one whole piece which I found annoying would have been good to build the rear yourself or turn it into a cargo plane.

Pros:
Large!
Interior is pretty good
Door mechanism is good
Front of plane looks awesome

Cons:
Only two engines with option for more but werent supplied.
Wing span area lacked detail, as it was just one big plastic piece
Could have done more with the rear.

But overall I like it as it is a LEGO PLANE!

I had more fun building the small car and the minifigs than the plane itslef!

finished building the airport and the radio tower!

It was interesting. The airport had a lot of features. - Revolving door that actually turned, lights around the airport, security checkpoints, baggage xrays, a ticket counter with a computer, vending machine I think, radio antennas.


In summary overall as a whole the 3182 set is really awesome. It has so many componets and sections very fun to build. Initially after building the plane I was gonna give it 4/5 but now after building everything else Id give it 4.5/5. A must if you want to own an airport.

"jake9","2010-10-10T01:06:01.91Z","Amazing Airport","When I was a kid, I always wanted a LEGO airport. About 20 years later I finally got one. I got this at TRU's buy 1 get 1 half off sale. This set is very cool, folks. First, the terminal is fantastic. There are glass pieces at the front, and there is architectural detail with the curved pieces on the roof. The revolving door is amazing too, and is actually made up of four 6-high windows. The interior houses a coffee kiosk, a ticket counter, baggage x-ray areas, and a vending machine. There are some stickers in these areas, so be prepared to apply them. One of them mimics a board of departure and arrival times to various European cities. A nice detail.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The control tower is very real-looking and fits the terminal style well. It has a clever radar setup on the roof that swivels easily. The interior allows room for only one controller, however. But the seat swivels and there are two computers and a lever which add nice detail.</div><div><br></div><div>The airliner is huge! It is wide enough to have the passenger seats side-by-side with an aisle down the middle. There is even a first class area and a baggage hold aft of the passengers. There is a microwave oven and some taps forward of the cabin.&nbsp;This set has many large pieces which are unique to the airport: The main wing, the nose piece that includes the glass already in place, and the tail which has a graphic that is NOT a sticker.</div><div><br></div><div>I added some road plates to make taxi and runway areas. This gave it a much more defined airport feel.</div><div><br></div><div>I know it's a bit pricey, but if you're a fan of LEGO City and/or aircraft themes then this is a must have set.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"vlaky4","2010-06-10T20:27:14.03Z","Way Better than the Older Airport Set","This set is just amazing compared to the 2006 airport set. There are two floors, which is a first, 2 security checkpoints, also new, plus a big airplane and a seperate control tower. The check-in desk is a bit plain. No scale for weighing luggage, just the desk and a computer. Security checks at both ends of the airport add one gate, because the older set had only one gate. Now the plane that comes with this and the passenger plane both have&nbsp;a place to be put at the same time. Another pro is the size of the plane. It is larger than the old set. There's also more minifigures to go with this, but why no control tower minifigure? All in all this set is perfect. I highly reccommend it. ",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5

Pros
- The revolving door which revolves
- The plane with now economy and first class
- Now there is a hostess instead of a second passenger
- Baggage Check on both sides of airport (Domestic and International)

Cons
- No air bridge only stairs
- Could have made four sets of engines instead of two
- No roads for the planes to land on

"SgtSmash","2011-03-30T17:48:31.173Z","Big ol' jet airliner...","<p>The latest Lego Airport is a great set, if you have the room to include it in your town. The actual airport itself and the accompanying air traffic tower can easily fit into any scheme, but if you plan on having a runway, you might want to clear some space. The jet&nbsp;is MASSIVE. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would liken this jet&nbsp;to an Airbus A380 in size comparison to the other Lego jets which have been offered previously.&nbsp;I'm not complaining at all, it's&nbsp;an awesome plane. I just think most people&nbsp;that have limited space in their town might find&nbsp;it a bit tough to incorporate it. The jet has room for 2 pilots in the cockpit, although the set only comes with one. You get 5 minifigs in all, the pilot,&nbsp;a stewardess, a runway worker/bag handler, one passenger (I felt for the price you should at least get 3-4) and one airport ticket agent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The airport itself is pretty cool, but the interior could have been a bit more thought out. The downstairs has some kind of weird food/soda vending machine which takes up one whole section. The other side has the ticket booth/bag X-ray machine which is nice. The upstairs has a dining area with the other side being a coffee maker and more seating. Not a whole lot to the interior, but it is bigger than the last airport I had way back in 1985. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been a huge proponent of Lego including baseplates with their sets, and while this set is crying for them, of course&nbsp;none are included.&nbsp;If you wanted a realistic runway, you'd need at least 3-4 straight road plates, and spending the&nbsp;$14.99 USD for a two-pack of plates which contain only&nbsp;(1) straight plate is&nbsp;not very cost effective and still gives you nothing to set the airport upon. You're better off buying 4 large baseplates for the same money to set the whole thing upon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I like the set and it adds a lot to your town, especially if you already own the train station and the Public Transport. It takes a bit of improv, like the Lego Garage, to get it to mate to your existing town, but I think Lego enjoys you spending the extra dough to do so. </p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4

The control tower is very cool (except for the obvious lack of a means for the operator getting to the top). &nbsp;Due to lack of real estate in my apartment here in Taiwan, I put the tower on top of the terminal. &nbsp;Once back home in the States, it will be in a dedicated location and separate from the terminal. &nbsp;The revolving door on the terminal was much more sturdy than it looked.</div><div><br>There is a little fuel island, too. &nbsp;It comes with a streetlight to match the rest of the City lights and a little fuel pump and oil drum (not sure I would trust fuel from a drum going into an airliner).</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, the set is necessary to complete the city. My seaplane and Passenger Plane and new airliner have a place to come and go from. &nbsp;It's no doubt the best looking airport in LEGO history and has the most realism and playability. &nbsp;Besides the preformed pieces in the airliner, the obvious lack of any sort of runway detracts from the scene. &nbsp;A pair of plates would have been received with a warm welcome. &nbsp;It's really necessary to achieve the look needed. &nbsp;I would have paid a few more bucks for it.</div><div><br></div><div>Get this airport. &nbsp;Either replace your old airport or relocate it to an unused part of town. &nbsp;This one is great. &nbsp;It won't be in stores forever, and it may be a few years before another one is released.</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"PistonCup74","2011-02-09T15:54:36.73Z","There's So Much To Do at the Lego City Airport!","<p>I got this set for Christmas, and I really enjoy it. It had great parts, and lots of playabilty. I loved the control tower, building, luggage cart and all the lamps it came with. Goes great with 3179 (Lamp Repair), which I also got.&nbsp;Inside the airplane, I liked the seats, tables,&nbsp;sink, and 10 seats. I&nbsp;did use the man with the&nbsp;blue pilot shirt, smile face, and brown hair&nbsp;as a copilot.&nbsp;However, some major drawbacks are that there are lots of stickers, no jetway, and only 1 passenger. I also modified it and put the oven in the building and the soda machine in the plain. You almost never see ovens in planes, and most planes have a soda machine.&nbsp;The building was fun, although there were some huge pieces. The door also falls off alot, although I don't mind.&nbsp;Overall, I rate this&nbsp;set a 5/5.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The box depicts the terminal, a tourist minifigure going to the plane, a stewardess welcoming the pilot, the mechanic marshaling the plane and&nbsp;the airport worker driving the baggage car with the ATC tower and fuel island in the background. The back of the box has 9 more snapshots of the set and the HEY! There are 6 instruction booklets, 1 for the bagage car and fuel island, 1 for the plane, 1 for the termminal and 1 for the control tower.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You get a frying pan in this set which is rare, the transparent cone pieces and red grill bricks, in other words, it is great!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 minifigures are included with this set, 1 pilot, stewardess, mechanic, passenger/tourist and an airport worker. The tourist's torso has a new hawaiian theme torso which is cool.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much to say....sorry.....</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane holds a red and white colourscheme. Its interior consists of 10 passenger seats and 2 pilot seats making a total of 12 seats. There are 2 engines on the wing, did i mention a refreshment table and microwave inside the plane but the cockpit doesn't support thrusters that is VERY dissapointing, it&nbsp;is replaced by a STICKER! The terminal has 2 seats in the lobby outside, a light post, garbage can and a parking sign. The interior includes a check in counter, 2 security checkpoints, vending machine,&nbsp;baggage claim and a&nbsp;cafe with 2 seats. The fuel island has 1 oil drum, computer monitor with handles and another light post. The baggage car? Nothing new and the ATC is boring but the glass panels swivels! p.s:I found a way to fit thrusters in the cockpit but im not telling you how!</p>

I’ve done a fair amount of travelling since those heady days of being toilet trained, or whatever it is 8-year-olds do, and I decided that it was time to treat myself to an airport after all those years of wishing for one, and so it was that I bought the latest iteration (as of 2011) of the LEGO airport for myself.</span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">As with just about every modern LEGO set of this size, 3182 is divided into four distinct components: the baggage carrier/mobile staircase/refuelling station, the control tower, the airport terminal, and, of course, the airplane. Since the bulk of this review will focus on the airplane, I save that for last and address the other three components first. Also, as mentioned, this is the first and only airport set that I own or am likely to own, so I am unfortunately unable to make comparisons to other similar sets from years gone by.</span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">To begin, the baggage carrier is more functional than anything else, able to hold three suitcases and possibly the landing lights (which I’m sure have a proper name). The staircase does line up nicely with the cabin door - as indicated in the official picture - and it also can be attached to the &nbsp;back of the vehicle, so it does its job well. The refuelling pump is more of an afterthought that anything else, although I did not say no to cannibalising the street lamp for the rest of my city display. </span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">The control tower is actually a surprisingly attractive component to the airport, as the windows are arranged in a 45-degree-ish angle that’s rarely seen, especially in the city line. The receiver above the control station does rotate, although to me it seems more reminiscent of small country airports than major international ones. Regardless, the control tower works well and looks good, so you’re unlikely to be unhappy with that.</span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">The terminal building is probably the most disappointing aspect of the set. Certainly, it has its high points: the revolving door, the x-ray machine, and the ticketing counter, for instance, but it mostly feels cobbled together and doesn’t look particularly good from either side. The set’s relative lack of Minifigures (just five of them) also shows here, as you’ll find the terminal to be a ghost building if you’re just using the ones included in the set, and its deserted hallways will seem particularly ludicrous next to the massive airplane that has come in to land. I have the terminal building arranged so that its back is facing me, and it now serves as a weird sort of mall in which one needs to have one’s bags x-rayed upon entry. Given the sheer number of police stations that the LEGO city seems to have, though, I’m sure that LEGO city residents are used to such Orwellian surveillance methods by now. </span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">The best part of this set is undoubtedly the airplane, and it is massive. Measuring at 51 cm (20 inches) from tip to tail and with a wingspan of roughly 48 cm (19.1 inches), it is highly likely that this behemoth is not going to fit on your shelf the way you want it to, but more on that later. The plane itself features a spacious cockpit that has room enough for two pilots (although the set only comes with one) and a detailed cabin behind it. This egalitarian jet has no delineation among first, business, or economy classes, although who needs legroom anyway when you’re a Minifig? As with just about all of the modern city vehicles, the top of the plane opens easily so that children can add or remove passengers without hassle, or so that grown-ups can recreate the Miami Airport scene from Casino Royale. </span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">In spite of its size, the airplane is relatively easy to put together, especially since it features a number of large specialty pieces in order to give it its attractive curves. The frustrating part of the construction was the myriad of stickers that need to be applied onto the plane; in fairness, most of them are fairly easy to apply, but I refrained from applying the ones on the wings themselves because I just knew that they weren’t going to be symmetrical unless I had a laser guidance system or something like that.</span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">The presence of the large pieces, though, means that the plane sort of ends up having a very “un-LEGO-ish” look, but I do, in a slightly ironic way, perhaps, find that this is sort of a plus for the plane. Because of the plane’s size, I found that I was unable to properly integrate it into the rest of my city display, and so I was pleased to find out that the airplane actually looks very good as a standalone model. Your own predilection towards a solution like mine will probably vary based upon how much affinity you have towards the romance of air travel, in spite of all the suffering associated with it, and I personally am very pleased to have my own model airplane that can encompass all the travelling I’ve done in the years gone by.</span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">But, awkward ruminations aside, this iteration of the LEGO airport is a nice set to have if you don’t already have one of the previous airports. The feature-heavy plane and terminal will probably make the set more appealing for children than for adults, although, as mentioned in excruciating detail, the plane does serve as a very attractive model on its own, in my opinion. Lack of Minifigs and a relatively boring terminal building (appearance-wise) may cause some to shy away. Ultimately, for AFOLs, I really do suspect that the mileage that one gets from this set will vary proportionately with how much sentimentality you attach to airports and airplanes, and for me, I attach a whole lot of it. </span></div></span>",TRUE,3,4,4,4,3

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Big airplane with 10 passenger seats&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Cool terminal with little coffee shop and coffee maker&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The revolving door is cool</li>
	<li>Tower has much details</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
	<li>There is place for two pilots, but only one is included</li>
	<li>There are not enough airport customers&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The stair at the little car (I&nbsp;don&acute;t no what it&acute;s called) is a little bit unstable, but not much</li>
	<li>The passengers has to wait out of the terminal</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all it is a cool playset&nbsp; and for the price absolutely okay. I recommend buying for any person who likes airports. I think it is the best airport in terms of value for money.</p>
