"iamburning","2009-11-17T23:21:07.81Z","A great addition to the fire collection","I'll do the standard pros/ cons review:

Pros:
Vehicle design - the quick response vehicle is a nice complement to the ladder for smaller incidents.  The ladder has a new (and pretty nifty) way to access the cab, and there are now two seats for the firefighters.

Garage area - this is very visually appealing and the picture doesn't really do it justice.  the skylights are nice but will fall off as they don't attach to anything.  Both bays are tall enough to house a large truck as well (why Lego couldn't afford to give us 2 more garage door pieces on the previous station is anyone's guess)

Cons:
The ladder is very short on the truck.  One of the selling points of 7945 was the high reach of the booms.

The living area seems to be an afterthought and isn't integrated into the set very well.

The high price!  79.99 is an awful lot for what you get, especially since 7945 was $20 us cheaper, has better play value, and can still be found rather plentifully.

The verdict?  Any kid would be happy have it (young or old :) ) - even better if you can find it on sale some day......",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ogel646","2009-11-30T20:30:13.607Z","great addition","After I opened the box, I realized that this set is better than expected anyway. Although you will feel 7945 has better value at first glance...

Pros:
NEW rescue net made of rubber, it can be curved at your wish which looks realistic
The fire car has 2 seats, better than the one from 7945
Nice design of the windshield with the piece from the bus
The garage! You can store tools in it
Commander's van has more space for storage compared to 7945
A new face of minifigure
Flat HDTV??    

Cons:
Stickers... Especially you found your sticker was folded! 
Will be a little bit expensive for $80...  $70 is more appropriate
Building doesn't match the style of fire department

You may have to get both this and 7945 to complete the whole fire line... 7945 as the command center and this one as a ""action center""... ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Duq","2011-06-07T18:22:41.567Z","Some good bits, some bad bits, but tons of fun","The fire station set is one of those evergreens; every three or four years there's a new fire station and they always sell. This is the twelfth fire station since 1978 and it's clearly an evolution of set 7945 from 2007. And for the most part that's good news.<br><h4>Building</h4>Opening the set showed lots of numbered bags and four booklets. Unfortunately the booklets and sticker sheet were mangled by the baseplates and bags moving around the box.<br>Each booklet matches a number of bags; one for each of the cars and two for two sections of the building; the garages and the tower. That makes it easy for two siblings to share the build - or the whole family in our case.<br>Building is fairly straightforward; no difficult building techniques, lots of big parts like columns and wall panels.<br><h4>The cars</h4>This fire station, like many before it, comes with two cars, a big and a small. The good news is the big one; it's a ladder truck, and one of the best looking fire trucks in years. Two firemen can sit in the big square cab. The roof hinges open to easily put the firemen in.<br>The bad news is the small car. It looks like a bit of an after-thought. It's a narrow car with wheels sticking outside the wheel arches like a monster truck but a front that looks like a van.<br><h4>The building</h4>Like with the cars there's good news and bad news. First the good news. Two cars, so there's a double garage. The roll up doors and roof lights are familiar features but this time there's a bit more white. The window frames at the front are a nice touch, as is the green recycling bin.<br>The bad news is in the tower part of the building. The firemans pole is a floppy tube, not the technic axle that was used in a previous fire station. Because the way it's connected the firemen can't slide down the pole. The bunk bed is an original feature but the poor guys don't have much privacy: their bed is in front of the all-glass front of the building.<br>At least they have a coffee maker and a wide screen tv to kill time.<br><h4>The cat</h4>One of the traditional tasks of a fire department is rescueing cats from the tops of trees. This fire station has a big net to catch jumpers (human or feline) and the set comes complete with tree and cat. Unfortunately the tree is tiny. As my nine year old son said: why do they need the ladder? The car is taller than the tree...<br><h4>Conclusion</h4>Ok, so I've got some adult complaints. For the target audience there's little to complain though; two cars, two roll up garage doors, four firemen with lots of tools, a cat, a net... There's a lot to play with in this set.<br>",TRUE,4,3,5,5,3

<p>The set contains 8 divided builds for the trucks and station and took around 80 mins to build . </p>

"coldcomfort","2011-01-04T14:20:09.15Z","7208 Fire Station - Impressive looking set with many good features.","<p>This is my first fire/rescue set and I think I chose the right one to start with. It has many nice accessories, extremely well built vehicles and was quite fun to build.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Both the quick response vehicle and the fire truck are extremely solid and very functional. The pneumatic extension ladder on the fire truck was really fun to build and quite entertaining to fool around with. I noticed that one reviewer said the ladder was too short as compared to a previous set. I took the third ladder section (intended for use with the quick response vehicle) and added it to the boom. This was convenient as there was no other place to store it tidily and the firetruck still fits in its bay perfectly.<br></li><li>For once I feel like the set I bought came with a good amount of minifigures. Many times I find sets wanting with empty vehicle seats or lots of unused space, but with every truck seat filled with one minifigure left over to watch over the station I think they got this one right.<br></li><li>Having never had a fire station before, the garage doors are completely new to me. I was very surprised by how attractive and functional they are. They're really a simple feature, but they really make the station pop. An additional note, I received an extra 26 pieces with this set. That strikes me as quite a lot of extras.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>At just over 12 cents American per piece I agree with others that this set is moderately overpriced. I think $70 US would be more appropriate.<br></li><li>The buildings are not attached to each other in a very stout manner and each is built on a separate plate. The end result is that if you had to move this set or if you played with it frequently you would wind up having to rebuild portions of it often.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is definitely worth owning and will serve as an excellent anchor to your City's fire/rescue squad. It is fun to build, attractive to look at and I believe it would be quite fun to play with. Buy it with confidence, but look for it on sale first.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
"AETerry","2012-01-14T12:12:57.647Z","Fire Station Review","<p>If you collect City/Town and are trying to fill out your Emergency Response teams and Public Services sector.... a Fire Station is a must have. <br></p><p></p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>There's not much to say about the box other than that it's cardboard and shows a clear illustration of what you're getting. There are four instruction booklets that break down this set into sections with clear, illustrated step by step instructions. The biggest thing for a set this size is that it will be time consuming to put together.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>At 662 pieces, I don't think the value of this set is worth the piece count though 
unless you're accounting for the number of minifigures and specialty 
pieces such as the ladders, rare cat and net piece.</p><p>There are a lot of red pieces and ""garage pieces"" so I suppose with the high number of rare and specialty pieces the price might be worth it.</p><p>There is a total of 8 numbered bags so it's easy to separate this set out for building. Love them are hate, there are also stickers to placed on this set.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get a grand total of four Firefighter minifigures. Something in retrospect that I would have liked to have seen is that one of these be a female character, but perhaps later in a newer Fire Station set there could be one. And besides, nothing prevents switching out the heads on figures anyways.</p><p>Still, four figures to fill out this station, coupled with those from any other sets that a person may or may not have been picked up and there's a good fire fighting crew.<br></p><p></p><h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The build is fairly simple with a lot of repetitiveness in it. As a modular build, you'll build this set in various stages.</p><p>You have two fire vehicles, one of which is a hook &amp; ladder truck. Both are standard vehicles builds from LEGO themed towards Fire Trucks. The hook &amp; ladder is a classic truck that many think of when they see/hear sirens blaring as firefighters race towards a burning building to put it out.</p><p>The building - Fire Station itself one one hand it baffles me the way it's build in sections and isn't on one large base plate and it's final layout. <br></p><p>You start with the garage section one, then you build part of the interior of the building. Next than is garage section two and the other half of the building's interior. Both of which are built on small base plates then connected together using technic pins, with towards the end, a larger plate for the roof connecting it all together for locking. The final result looks good. I just find it baffling building it in this type of sections while building this set.</p><p>The next baffling part for me is the location of the next build for the fireman's pole. That it's off to the right of the building and not in back to try and convey being inside. Continuing to build off to the right and elongating this building further out are the ""main office"" and sleeping quarters. To me, it would have made much more sense if the ""fireman's pole"" and the sleeping quarters/main office section had been built so there was a hinge for swinging it out away from the back of the building creating this elongated look when it's opened up.</p><p>I get that for play, a child has an easier time with the open back and moving figures around and accessibility. The logic baffles me as I could have seen this accomplished by having hinge pieces to swing the back side out for easy access. Otherwise the building looks just way too long and creates a sense of ""taking longer"" for the fire crew to descend down the pole and get to their vehicles in an emergency.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>I got this particular Fire Station to fill a gap in the overall layout of the LEGO City/Town collection I have. So whether you pick up this Fire Station, have picked up a different one
 in the past or are going to wait to see any new ones that LEGO may 
create in the future kind of doesn't matter. It's like a good hospital set or Police Station, get at least one building to flesh out the City/Town.</p><p>This particular Fire Station isn't that bad, just a bit baffling in some of the logics for building in sections and planning. I've seen other pictures of Fire Stations though that appear worse than this one for being too simple for my tastes or at the time, a lack of money meant I just hadn't picked them up at the time and thought I'd wait til a later reintroduction of the Fire Theme.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"av8r1973","2012-01-19T23:23:03.107Z","Excellent fire station, better than the last one","With a growing arsenal of fire fighting apparatus in my City, I needed a place to park them other than the Fire Brigade building, and the new Fire Station seemed to fit the bill.<div><br></div><div>The structure seemed to fit the modular build of the Police Station by allowing the garage build to be completed before the rest, or the office area done first. &nbsp;In between the buildings is a small courtyard &nbsp;area that connects the office and garage bays. &nbsp;In addition to the building, you get a small fast-response truck and a larger ladder truck. &nbsp;You also get an old-school tree and a cat to rescue.</div><div><br></div><div>I was impressed with the garage bays, despite the open sides. &nbsp;It makes getting the minifig in and out of the truck much easier. &nbsp;It was stronger than I thought it would be, too. &nbsp;The office area was nice, complete with gear storage on one floor, an operations center on another floor and a bunk house with an LCD TV on the third floor. &nbsp;With no ladder between them, I suppose my minifigs will have to teleport or use jetpacks to get between floors. &nbsp;The weak point, in my opinion, is the courtyard between the structures. &nbsp;It makes for a very flexible building when you try to move it.</div><div><br></div><div>The trucks are nicely done. &nbsp;The smaller response truck is a quick build and has lots of storage for extrication tools that weren't included in the set. &nbsp;The larger truck is a nice ladder truck with a telescoping ladder to reach the taller buildings in my City. &nbsp;Both chassis were unique builds, so there was no repetition.</div><div><br></div><div>Minifigs are pretty standard firefighters and the obligatory coffee cup was included.</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, this is a nicely done set. &nbsp;Bland minifigs, copious stickers and a lot of red are the only drawbacks. &nbsp;There's no mistaking this as a Fire Station. &nbsp;The ability to fully store the trucks in the bays makes this a better choice than the prior version. &nbsp;If you haven't gotten it yet, get it. &nbsp;There will probably be another one out in the next couple of years, but this is the best one for now. &nbsp;Good luck!!</div>",TRUE,5,3,5,5,4
"rinaldo","2012-01-13T11:18:42.353Z","A very nice Fire Station that should be more publicized","The <b>Fire Station</b> is a classic set of <b>LEGO</b>, as well as the <b>Police Station</b>, it has been present for a couple of decades in the <b>LEGO </b>catalog and is renewed every three or four years. In this case the set <b>7208 </b>was introduced in 2010 and is a <i>""must""</i> for those who collect the series <b>CITY</b>. It should be noted that recently the policy <b>LEGO </b>seems more oriented towards the Police rather than the subset <b>Firefighters</b>, and in fact at <b>LEGO </b>website, all the <b>CITY </b>videos are related to the theme <i>Police and Robbers</i>, while unfortunately the <b>Fire Department </b>are
 limited to extras. In my view, this gap should be filled because, from 
personal experience, the videos are of great ideas to invent stories to 
play with as well as have a big impact in the purchasing decision.<br>
<br>
The set consists of:<br>
<br>
<ul style=""text-align: left;""><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire car</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire truck with ladder lift</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two garages for a car and truck</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building with office and fire apartment </li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; minifigs and cat</li></ul>
The set is sold in a big box, with inside eight bags containing brick, 
two 16x16 baseplate, a baseplate 8x16, 8x12 and four instruction booklet
 to build respectively, the car, the trucks, garages and offices of the <span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">firefighters</span></span>.<br>
<br>
Wanting to follow the pattern proposed by <b>LEGO</b>, we start with the assembly of the car of <b>01</b>
 firefighters, this requires no special effort and assembles easily. The
 result is a truck with no doors that when the minifig must be entered 
has to be opened by pulling the roof, on the back there is a big gear 
compartment, and on the right and left side two other small 
compartments.<br>
<br>
Then we assemble the car <b>02 </b>of firefighters, in this case it's a 
big fire truck with a retractable ladder to rescue the people. The van 
appears to be well designed, the front has a windshield that is built on
 three sides (front, left and right), leaving a broad view of the 
driving area, also find place in it, with two special seats, two 
minifigs put in a row who may enter and exit through the roof hinged 
(much more elegant solution than simply attacking the roof off as in the
 car 01). In the rear of the truck there is the motion the mechanism 
that ensures the scale, this is almost 360-degree rotating, lifting, and
 extendable to allow a good range and is made with various solutions 
including the pistons Technic, which gives it a solid feel not only 
visual but also tactile when handling, in addition the latching 
mechanism of the scale plate is much stronger and more durable than that
 used in the set <b>7239</b>.<br>
<br>
Completed the two cars, you pass the assembly of the barracks, starting 
from the garage 01 and 02, in this case must have noticed how the same 
structure is very important, that many parts have open side but are also
 well finished, with example, the shutters of the garage are almost 
completely transparent, and on top of every garage, there is a fairly 
large skylight accomplished through the use of two juxtaposed plates 
windshield (very nice to see). Another thing I appreciate is the 
different length of the garage due to the different length of the fire 
truck, it should not be underestimated, since in the case of the police 
station garage <b>7498 </b>both have the same length and consequently the cars can not stay long in its entirety.<br>
<br>
The two garages are assembled separately and then joined two 16x16 
baseplate by means of pins technic also gives a union local at the 
center with access door and front window that serves as a storage and 
dressing room for the fire brigade.<br>
<br>
We then proceed with the construction of the building of fire starting 
from 8x16 plate resting on the ground floor where we find an office with
 front access door is completely transparent, a PC workstation built 
with flat tile and a coffee machine both very well made and accurate.<br>
<br>
On the first floor there is the apartment of fire, containing two bunk 
beds and an LCD TV placed in front of a swivel chair, in addition, there
 is a transparent door that allows access to the roof and the classical 
pole descent of the <span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">firefighters</span></span>, emergency, leads quickly to the ground floor.<br>
<br>
On a positive note the great use of transparent plate for the building, 
giving it a nice shiny appearance, although I would have liked to see 
the same spread over three floors to provide a visual impact even more 
impressive, also in this case as for the Police Station of 7498, I would
 have preferred to find a structure for connecting stairs between two 
floors of the building of Firefighters.<br>
<br>
After the building, this unit has to be united with the garage by means 
of pins technic returning the complete fire station, from an overall 
look, I think that something more must be done in terms of playability 
of the set, for example, I would have liked to see the pole down <span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">firefighters</span></span>
 more centered in the structure of the building making this a typical 
circular hole in which to slide the pole through the Fire Department 
plans.<br>
<br>
I conclude with a note of color, indicating the possibility of 
recreating a typical setting for the rescue of firefighters with the 
equipment set, in fact using, the white cat, the tree and the ladder can
 stage the rescue by <span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">firefighters</span></span> climbed the cat tree that can no longer get.<br>
<br>
After assembly I believe are worth noting:<br>
<br>
<b>PRO</b><br>
<ul style=""text-align: left;""><li>Firetrucks well made and solid</li><li>Garage of different lengths with no problems hosting the van and truck</li><li>Structure of the two garages very nice to see</li><li>Extensive use of transparent doors and vertical plate that give brightness to the structure</li><li>Well-designed accessories of&nbsp; offices</li></ul>
<br>
<b>AGAINST</b><br>
<br>
<ul style=""text-align: left;""><li>Car firefighters 01 with the front that could be improved</li><li>Fire Building could be improved (I would like to have liked an additional plane)</li><li>Pole down Firefighters outside the building</li><li>No comics in <b>LEGO </b>sets or videos on the website relating to firefighters who create ideas for the game</li></ul>
<br>
<b>Conclusions</b>:<br>
<br>
This is a set of very nice that you can not miss the collection of small
 and LEGO AFOL. It has some weight in the construction of the building 
that the fire could be more impressive, but at the same time the fire 
trucks in support is really well done and worthy of being sold 
separately.<br>
