"SgtSmash","2010-03-06T01:53:21.543Z","Oink Oink","<p>Was shocked today when I went to the Lego store at the MOA, and there was the Pig Farm with Tractor! I didn't think it was released yet! But after seeing the pictures for some time, I guess I didn't expect this small set to cost $34.99&nbsp;USD either. But, I had a $20&nbsp;store credit, so I used&nbsp;it on this set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Price aside (I'd value at $27.99), I think this is a great set. You get 4 pigs, a really cool mint green tractor with trailer, a pig pen with amenities, and two pig-loving minifigs. The male farmer is basically the same one&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Farm set, but with a different hat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would have been nice if this set had come on a small baseplate, as the pig pen fences are flimsy,&nbsp;but,&nbsp;if you already have the Farm set with&nbsp;any extra green baseplates, you can just mate this up to those sets&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm glad Lego is continuing&nbsp;the Farm theme. Now if they'd&nbsp;just release a FARM HOUSE!</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,3

I was convinced i only got 3, but having looked at the bag with them in, which i did not need to open to make the tractor, i see there are indeed 4 pigs - so sorry for any confusion caused. Just makes the set even better to have an extra one!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,4
"TinyHippo","2010-03-09T13:51:15.31Z","Pig-stastic","This set really impressed me. Between the exclusive pig-figs to the well constructed Tractor-Trailer and the little sty.

"jinxjinx550","2010-03-28T18:11:00.7Z","Oh, the Pigs!","Animals are a wonderful part of modern LEGO, and this set is a great example of just why that's true.&nbsp; The set gives you two interesting vehicles, a playset area, two minifigs, and -- not one, not two, not even three, but FOUR pigs.&nbsp; <br><br>It's a fun build, too. With the vehicles (the lime green tractor and the farm cart) there are all kinds of unexpected steps.&nbsp; Both vehicles do various things, connect together and steer quite well.&nbsp; They look realistic and lend themselves to lots of rural landscape settings.<br><br>But the pigs!&nbsp;&nbsp; They can be modern, they can be mediaeval.&nbsp; They can befriend a young girl watching spiderwebs in the barn.&nbsp; A group of four of them is practically a crowd of pigs, and perfect for making any farm scene look more real.&nbsp; The model is nicely made -- great ears and tail, interestingly detailed faces, and a real look of classic pig in their posture.<br><br>I was also thrilled to find my first 2x4 tile piece in the set.&nbsp; Overall, a great buy!<br><br><br>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,3
"Boidoh","2010-12-22T15:59:40.783Z","Rare pieces, a pig farm with pigs and a tractor.","<p>With this set you get some rare pieces (Pigs and carrots and grass/tree), FOUR pigs, 2 minifigures and a tractor... Oh i forgot and a pig pen (no not the kind you write with). Lets cut to the chase:</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>4 Pigs 
<li>2 Minifigures 
<li>A Pig Pen (In other words a place where a pig lives) 
<li>Grass Piece 
<li>Tractor w/ Trailor 
<li>Carrots 
<li>Little Shed 
<li></li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>The gates are kinda flimsy...</li></ul>
<p>Otherwise this is a great set. Im not sure what the price is as i got this and more as some of my early christmas gifts. If your buying this for the pieces its also great except most of the pieces are made up of small pieces. Although the Tractor w/ Trailor contains more large pieces.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"hartho","2011-02-13T04:54:33.19Z","Great addition to the farm","<p>Being already in the possession of the original farm published by Lego I really loved this addition to that. Especially the tractor is well done. The amount of details on there is just amazing, the weights at the front, the lifting mechanism at the back, just amazing.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-weight: bold; "">Pros</span></p>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<p>I don't think the set is available anymore at the Lego shop, but I am sure in retail stores it still can be purchased somewhere, maybe even for a better price than it's original one. I strongly recommend buying this set in addition to the farm.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"melvlee","2017-10-09T15:16:25.067Z","Delightful farm set!","<p>I was attracted to this set (and series as a whole) when it first came out, for some reason I didn&#39;t buy any of them and regretted not doing so soon after. So when a chance came along to buy this one, I didn&#39;t hesitate this time.</p>

<p>This is a thoroughly delightful and fun set, and with a sub-theme that Lego sadly either doesn&#39;t seem to value very much, or one that isn&#39;t so attractive to its young audience. I mean, it&#39;s been 7 years now and while the City theme has seen a lot of varied sub-themes, they are still largely (understandably) variations on adventure and rescue kind of topics.</p>

<p>In this set, you get FOUR (4) pigs! That must be some kind of record for number of animals in a set! (Though you also get 4 sled dogs in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60034-1/Arctic-Helicrane"">60034</a> Arctic Helicrane too, but how often do you see Lego pigs!?)</p>

<p>There is a cute little pig-sty with some feeding troughs, a cool and realistic looking tractor which pulls a trailer with a nice ramp for loading the pigs. This is great fun (if you don&#39;t think too far ahead at what lies in store for the piggies after they are loaded up...).</p>

<p>I thought the standard-issue baseball cap for the farmer was a bit dull so I gave mine a Tan coloured fedora hat instead just like the farmer in the larger more expensive Farm set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7637-1/Farm"">7637 . </a></p>

<p>It would have been nice for a few more small or medium sets to build up the farm but this set is great all the same.</p>

<p>I hope Lego re-visits this theme before too long.</p>
