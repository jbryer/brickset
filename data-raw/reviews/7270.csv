"plmokj4","2009-11-23T19:26:45.56Z","Here comes the giant crab!!","When i saw this set at toys r us, i knew that i had to buy it. It is a very sturdy set with lots of good things. First of all, the diver is really cool. Second, the crab is just outstanding. Not that much stickers is also a great thing.

 So if you see this set in a store, buy it for two reasons. 
1. it is cheap
2. alot of pieces for the price",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legojango","2009-11-25T20:04:48.95Z","LOVE IT!","ok, wel, first with the minifigure. The helmet is really nice, whit a removable visor i can stick on to other helmets. and the body is really cool, with a two-sided face and a logo on the pant leg. The new treasure piece is nice, i cant to get all fove of them!
Now to the crab. Those orange piceses are really cool, and useful. Mine was missind the headplate, so it's incomplete. :( Those things for the feet ive' never see before, but they are cool.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2009-12-16T15:01:54Z","A good set, but not the best crab","This set is okay.  It is fine for a smaller set in the series, but we have seen better crabs.  In the Aqua Raiders, we got a great crab in set 7774 Crab Crusher.

I think the real problem with this set is the claws.  They can open and close, and they can move back and forth.  That is a nice feature, but they cannot twist.

In addition, the legs cannot move forward or backward in a walking motion.  The can only move up and down.

Now this being one of the less expensive sets, it does not need to be that great, but with some other really good sets mixed in with the lower price point of this theme, I do not think that it stacks up.  

The shark and the first small sub can really be stand alone displays.  I would not recommend this one to someone who is just trying to see if they like this theme.  Spend a few dollars (or euros) more and get the shark.   If you don't like the theme, you will still have a very nice model.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2009-11-27T16:18:32.827Z","Nice job LEGO","This is a nice little set and I'm very glad I bought it.

First off, the treasure piece: It is, as you can see, a trans-orange and gold ring surrounding a trans-orange triangle. The ring fits into a minifigs hand and the bottom of this piece can pop onto a stud. The design on the triangle is a crab. Not much else to say.

The Minifig: 

The minifig has dark gray legs with light gray hips. His 'feet' have a small silverish-gray pattern on them, most likely meant to resemble boots. Half way up the legs are lime kneepads. On the left leg is a red circle with silver outline and a black trident inside. On the hips is a green stipre with black dots, most liekly a belt. 

The torso is double-sided four green container things painted on the bottom of the front and back. The front also has two silver tubes while the back has four. This little guy then has lime gren arms and black hands.

The head is simple but double-sided, with a determined look on one side and a paniced look on the other. 

The helmet is a new piece that I must say I like. The front part with the green visor sticks out a bit from the face, which seems as if it would allow for better viewing for the diver. The top has three small things that keep the visor from moving, which makes sense. Would you want you're visor to lift up while you're diving? The back of the helmet has two oxygen tanks and two technic axle/pin holes. I sense great MOCing possibilities for this piece.

The minifig also posseses a pair of lime flippers and a black harpoon gun.

The Crab:

This little guy is easily the best part of the set. Each of his legs have orange spike and end in a new claw piece. Each leg is also possible, capable of bending in two different spots. 

The crabs back is nice, and this is where the four stickers in this set are used. One is his eyes while the other three are the patterns on his back. If you look at the middle pattern, you can see the orange shape of the treasure piece.

The claws are almost as large as the crabs body, but they are still awesome. They can each move individually left and right. Each is also capable of being opened and closed, and the silver tooth on the inside of each makes it possible for out little crab friend to hold the treasur contained in this set.


Overall, I would highly reccomend this set to anyone. It is small, and it has made me want more Atlantis sets. If you're not looking for a set, this also contains some useful MOCing pieces. Hope this was useful!

"JBH75","2009-12-25T11:13:20.607Z","Merry Christmas from the crab","This was one of the sets I worked on this Christmas, and for a small set, it is pretty good. It has a well-designed crab, that has much better stability than the 2007 Aqua raiders Lobster, and a new leg piece, a new diver minifigure, and a sort of collectable disk. For a more indepth review, here are the p/c's

Set Pros:
Minifigure with double-sided head, new double-sided torso, and new pants
New scuba tank accessory, and harpoon gun
Orange Crab disk that fits onto studs, or can be grabbed
Well Designed
Lots of playability, especially if worked with other Atlantis sets

Crab Pros:
Stable
Well designed
New leg piece that is flexible (also found in guardian of the deep)
Snapping claws

Cons: 
Stickers needed for crab
Claws are more like jaws, but that is fixable.

Overall, I thought this set was great and it is a nice small set for the atlantis line-up. You'll really enjoy it.

Also, I thought crabs had eight legs?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Squidtron","2009-12-26T13:52:54.013Z","Crab King Of The Sea.","I got this set from Frenzy yesterday and it was AWESOME!! This crab even though smaller than the Aqua Raiders crab is a lot feicer. This 14 eyed crustation is heavily armored so that diver is gonna need more than 1 harpoon to kill it. Not only does this crab have good deffence though it also has Big claws and pointed feet. Even though it is only advertised to only be able to hold the treasure, it can hold anything from Kranxx's Speeder to the diver minifig. Also it's impossible to sneek up on this guy because his 14 eyes can see all round. The diver though not a match for the crab is cool and has an awesome helmet and harpoon gun.

Now for the Cool/Not Cool things about this set:
The claws and legs can move(+2)
Cool Parts(+2)
Looks Vicious(+1)

The new diver's suits are very detailed, and are much advanced from Aqua Raiders. The crab is also very posable, and features the new claw/tooth pieces on the feet.

Pros:
Diver (The names are all mixed up, so it's almost impossible to tell who he is)
ORANGE TREASURE KEY
Snapping claws
Looks good

Cons:
The return of STICKERS (Crab eyes, and back patterns)

<p>Down here in Australia, the eagerly anticipated LEGO Atlantis line has just surfaced (see what I did there?) and I eagerly bought this set along with 8057. The two sets together make a nice diorama or display scene. Anyway, onto the main review.</p>
<ul>
    <li>MINIFIGS: The set features only one minifig - one of the deep sea divers. However, the detail and design of this diver makes up for the fact that he is the only minifig to be found. The diver has a face that can be switched between stern/scared, and superb detailing on both the legs and the body - both back and front. Completing the diver is his brand new helmet and a classic harpoon gun. Definitely worth having a few of these divers in your collection. 4.5/5</li>
    <li>CRAB: The centrepiece of the set. The crab is a small yet efficient design, made with a threatening colour sceme of black and orange with menacing angles that that contrast nicely with the rounded vehicles of the human divers. The crab has a quick build time, and the claws, whilst chunky, are simple enough to enjoy. 4/5</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, whilst not the defining set of the ambitious Atlantis line, 8056 is a fine set if you want to start small or only want one cheap set to represent the series. Worth a look. 8.5/10</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"ggggggggggggggggggggggggg","2009-12-30T10:51:54.73Z","A good set","This set is quite good it has some usefull parts and some new to me, the parts which are new to me are the spikes at the ends of the legs, the 'key' and the parts in the middle of the legs (not the spikes) as the have a hole in the middle. The diver minifig is very well detailed and has a new helmet and visor.
The 'key' is quite intresing the one in this set is orange and a a crab like symbol on it. The crab is quite cool I quite like the stickers on it and the legs keep it up well although the claws seem a bit oversized. Overall I would recommend this set, especially for MOCists.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"parchioso","2010-03-12T12:17:41.357Z","Interesting crab","<p>I built the 8056 Monster Crab Clash tonight, and feels better about this set than 8061. Although The crab is still not very realistic (the body is small), but it is quite well designed in coming up with the claw and legs, the crab is also fun to play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diver is the same design as 8061, but with a different minifig head, in general, I would say that the Atlantis minifigs are quite good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And from this set you get the yellow ring key too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One observation on the diver's helmet though, not sure if that is a defect or something by design, I found the same crack in all three diver's helmets (including 2 from 8061), please check out my blog to see the picture of the helmet, I like to know if you see the same thing in your set.</p>

"The_Brick_Show","2010-02-03T12:53:37.013Z","Great Black Crab w/ Killer Spikes","I love most of the Atlantis themed sets and this set is just one more reason why. I bought it for $9.99 and you get alot for that price. The diver mini figure comes with alot of nice gear. The harpoon gun is one of the longer guns i've seen. An his fins are a nice touch. 

The crab is just pure killer cool. Fangs, claws, spikes...he has it all. The diver is definitely outmatched on this one. His 6 legs are even a little flexible giving it a nice bounce. And the mouth move both up and down and side-to-side.

PROS
 * Price Point is Great
 * Black Crab's Killer Fangs and Claws
 * Orange Spikes On Crab
 * Orange Treasure Key

CONS
 * Minifig fins fall off easy.

<p><strong>Playability:</strong> The amazing posability on the legs saves the set, giving it an appeal to collectors of dioramas.

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T10:58:47.167Z","Atlantis, a lost civilization found again.","<p>Set #8056 Monster Crab Clash: When I first learned of the Atlantis sets that LEGO was going to be releasing I literally broke into a wide grin and got super excited. I always loved the Aquazone Theme from back in the day and miss the sets I and my brother had accumulated during that time (they were some of the first to go, unfortunately), so I decided that I was going to collect Atlantis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right out of the gate I was not dissapointed with the overall theme of this... Theme. The numerous submersible craft look exciting and fun, the creatures and mini-figures standing against our intrepid explorers are really neat and brand new and the uniform coloring of all the expedition craft, plus the Atlantis Keys just add to the Gotta Collect'Em All mentality I have developed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from the Impulse sets this one is the smallest and cheapest of the Atlantis theme from this year. It includes one of the Atlantis keys, a harpoon gun, a set of flippers, and of course the pieces to build a very interesting looking LEGO Crab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first reaction to building this set was one of fun and enjoyment, but upon closer examiniation of the crab I have to wonder at the choice of placement for the claws. Really they should be aligned so they can actually pick things up rather than look like they're just hanging there. But I suppose for the price you're paying you can let that one slide, especially if you can figure out a good MOC/MOD to fix that particular problem without sacrificing the look of the crab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new diving equpiment used by these underwater explorers is a nice new piece, and as a bonus you can have him hold the flippers on each side of his helmet when he doesn't need to wear them. The Atlantis Key is also a nice new accessory, and makes for a nice change of pace compared to all those crystals that the Aquanauts and Aquasharks were fighting over. (I've still got a few of them for my Atlantis Expedition to stumble across while they're searching for the keys.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess that's really all I have to say on this set. If you haven't already picked it up I'd say you should really consider it, despite his flaws the crab is still menacing and the pieces used in his construction might be useful for MOCers. Plus for that price you really can't go wrong.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

He has the new atlantis torso and pants that have tools on them and there main colour which is light green. On the pants it also has a red patch with a spear/dagger printed in black on it.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build wasnt boring which is good&nbsp;and it was&nbsp;exciting to make.&nbsp;It took about 10 minutes to make. It was a great design and it was a fun build!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model included a Diver (which we've already talked about) and a big Monster Crab. The crab is black and orange&nbsp;and it has movable legs, feet and claws. the claws was the main downside to the set as they fall off easily and it looks more like a jaw. the cool thing about the claws though is that the tooth can hold the orange stone that the divers need. the eyes and body details are stickers (sadly) but the size of the crab is just right.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>We highly reccomend you to get this set. it isnt in stores anymore but you can get it off Ebay, Amazon or Trade-Me for sure. Thankyou for reading and please rate this review a 5/5.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Sobel","2020-05-02T20:43:30.253Z","Mutant crab with little use - but MAN that would make some pawn crackers!","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 8-9 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
This set introduces us to the first of several buildable deep-sea creatures from this series. The creatures all seem to be quite violent but have been tamed by the Atlanteans to protect their treasures.<br />
This set in particular features a crab-like monster with strange proportions and and body shape...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Obviously, the number of parts is mainly provided by the Fric/-parts for the legs. This set also contains one of the mythic discs of Atlantis, this one with a crab motive - of course.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One single deep-sea explorer with green vizor and flippers is included. He has a harpoon to defend against the crab. He also has the well-known two-sided head.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very, very simple. The process of building the legs is a little repetitive. The set has four stickers to apply, which is OK since they give the crab a little more detail.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The crab itself is some 10cm long and 5 cm high. The legs have two hinges each which gives them quite some possibilities of positioning. That way, the crab can either assume a walking/crouching position or a threatening/posing position with extended legs. The pincers are positioned at the front, can be moved left and right a little and the upper part can be moved up and down.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While the design of the crab has some interesting points to it, especially the legs, it is quite strange overall. The eyes are only stickers, which I found to be a little disappointing. The pincers are attached at a place where some sort of mouth should be. A few more parts and the claws might have been attached more to the side of the body (as with a real crab).<br />
Furthermore, there is not really anything you can play with this set alone except diver VS crab for the crab-disc-championship in a No-Holds-Barred-Match... errr, wrong category.<br />
So, nice idea, but not much to this set. Good addition to the overall concept of the series nonetheless.</p>

"NotoriousJam","2022-12-06T07:00:34.747Z","Look out, the crab's gonna get ya!","<p>Ah yes, the Atlantis line. I am one of the wearers of nostalgia goggles when looking at Atlantis sets, and this crab is truly one of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set contains: a diver, a crab ring, and a crab. That&#39;s it. The crab has clearly been under decent food provisions, as it is much bigger than normal crabs. It could even take on the Mirkwood spiders from the Hobbit set #79001 with its spiky glory, making it a worthy adversary to the seemingly innocent diver. His pinchers open and close, which is a common trait of pinchers to have. The diver can dive too if you put him into water, or into a deep pile of LEGO blue studs, so he should be enroled into the Olympics for sure.</p>

<p>Remember, the Atlantis explorers WERE trespassing into the Atlantis sea creatures&#39; homes, but instead of filing a lawsuit for trespassing and theft of property, these bad boys pinched and clawed their way towards the divers.</p>

<p>This crab is probably in its adolescence age, making its bravery that much more significant to face the invaders. Give this guy a hand (or claw)!</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t take long to build, and this set was a great way to get started with Atlantis: a good guy and a bad guy (you decide...)</p>

<p>Truly difficult to understand why this crab isn&#39;t worth hundreds: he is such an impactful character! The TRUE hero of the story, look at him go!</p>

<p>Oh, and he has a cool colour combo of black and orange, with red eyes to add to his friendly nature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have this set, then you probably understand its gloriousness. If not, perhaps this crab will make his way forcefully into your shopping cart. He needs a home. Let him in. He&#39;ll clap for you with his pinchers if you open and close them with your fingers, which is very kind of him.</p>
