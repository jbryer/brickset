"PaulC","2009-12-26T16:38:34.653Z","Atlantis looks promising!","The new Atlantis range has some of the coolest looking subs Lego have ever produced. Although some would prefer the more contemporary yellow underwater vehicles of themes past, these bright red Anime-inspired futuristic submersibles have a very strong unified design that gives them a real wow-factor, so I'm expecting this line to sell well.

Sometimes stickers add a lot to the look of a set, but because the design is so good these sets just don't need them. Leaving the stickers off means the pieces can be reused in many more ways, but in this case there is not a great number of parts for your £8 GBP so not many alternative models can be made, which is rather a shame.

I expect most kids will just assemble the sub as is, and then take it on adventures. The flick-fire missiles work ok as there is plenty of room to flick your finger at them, although their range is compromised a little by the heavy ends. Also the grappling hooks don't fit too snugly so there is a high probability of losing them if the missiles are used much.

The Shark-men I think are the coolest looking of the Atlantean adversaries. The ""collectable"" golden ring matches his trident so I am using it a his shield for now. The head and trident are rubberised, so will put up with much abuse and also be easier on parent's feet when they ""find"" them in the night.

Overall a neat little set with a clever 3-wide design. I've taken a point off for the inability to build many alternative models and the loose grappling hooks!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Minifigures-

Diver- This minifig is very nice and is a good addition to any collection, especially pirates, as this minifig looks a lot like brickbeard. Also the detailing on the torso and legs is just brilliant! He has the standard diver breathing equipment which allows him to swim in deep waters. The flippers are also cool. LEGO, you've done a great job on this minifig! A couple more things, if you buy more than one of this set you can make a pirate army! The mask is customizable with technic pieces!
5/5 for this minifig!

Shark warrior- Once again, this minifig is a great addition to any collection, and because this set is priced at just £7.00 you can buy a few at once (if you have enough money) and build an army! There are strange Atlantian markings on his head which is made of rubber. You can slightly see the top of the minifig neck from his mouth, but you can hardly call that a con. On the torso and legs are more strange markings which shows that he might have been mutated into half-human by something. This is my first shark minifig, and because this set is cheap, that that makes it even better! Of course the shark also has gills and a dorsal fin.
5/5 for this minifig!

Accessories-

Trident- This golden trident is, although very common, very cool. You can paint it red and make a custom Satan with it!
5/5 for this accessory!

Blue Atlantian key- This thing was a pain to get out of the bag, but that's not going to deduct from the score. The stud on the bottom is sweet. Obviously a minifig can hold it. Also, it has a squid/octopus symbol on it.
5/5 for this accessory!

Weck Raider- The Wreck Raider is nice and easy to build. There are some stickers which slow down the build a little but they are simple to apply. There are two propellers situated on either side at the back. If you blow on them they will spin. There are even two flick fire missiles with a nice little hook in the middle of each of them. I find them to work better if you put them in the second slot. There are also two fins on each side that can move up and down. 
5/5 for the Wreck Raider!

"P13c30fch33s3","2010-02-28T02:40:17.59Z","A neat little set, even if a little unsightly","<p>First of all, I will explain my title. I think this set is excellent, although it is not the best looking set Lego has ever made.</p>
<p>Shark Man, Trident + 'Key':</p>
<p>The shark head piece is excellent. It looks like a real shark's head, even including the gills. There is a pattern in dark blue on the top of its head, with a picture of an Atlantis 'key' in the centre. The shark's mouth can hold any lego object with a (lightsaber blade) stick part in its mouth.The shark's trident is well sculpted and resembles a real trident. The 'key' is a neat looking triangle within a ring. On the hidden side of the triangle, there is a hole that allows connection to basic lego pieces. The only problem with the key is that it shows a picture of a squid, while it should be a shark.</p>
<p>Atlantis Diver:</p>
<p>The Atlantis diver has a new helmet + airtanks piece. It looks very fitting with the theme, although slightly restricts movement. The Visor is larger than standard, but makes an excellent effect on the helmet. There are two holes in the sides of the helmet that allow technic pins to fit. The airtanks are hollow, and the bottom holes allow standard lego pieces to connect. The only piece missing would be a harpoon gun.</p>
<p>The Wreck Raider:</p>
<p>The Wreck raider has a very large front piece. This part is very sturdy and helps to hold the harpoon guns in place. The centrepiece is an engine. This helps as a mounting point for main pieces. It also holds the set together well. On the back of the main engine, there are two lego-technic 1*1*2 pieces, that hold the directional engines in place. The directional engines swivel, but hold their place. The two propellers are excellent pieces, and are extremely fitting with the set.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Good pieces</li>
    <li>'Key'</li>
    <li>Shark man</li>
    <li>Diver suit</li>
    <li>Propellers</li>
    <li>Trident</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Seems too fat at the front</li>
    <li>Diver must hang on for his life</li>
    <li>Seems unbalanced</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall: An excellent set to start with, as if you don't like the theme too much, you will not have wasted much money. This set is also excellent for rarer parts, like the propellers, harpoons and engine. An excellent set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Brickman193","2010-03-06T06:17:55.92Z","Deep Sea Danger, AKA Wreck Raider (Atlantis 8057)","<p>Many would consider the humble Wreck Raider to be the little brother of the Typhoon Turbo Sub (8060) or the Neptune Carrier (8075). However, the Wreck Raider is a nice set on its own or as an introduction, or perhaps as a support for the aforementioned bigger subs.</p>
<ul>
    <li>MINIFIGS: The set includes two minifigs; one deep sea diver and an Atlantis fish-man. The deep sea diver appears to be the veteran of the team, as he has a grey beard and only one eye. With him you get the new diving suit in green and grey and one of the six Atlantis keys. The shark man, or Atlantis warrior, is superbly detailed with a sturdy new headpiece. On said head (heheh, rhymes) the Sharkman features tattoos that have an Atlantis key in the centre. To fight the humans, the fish man carries a new pearl&nbsp;gold trident. 5/5</li>
    <li>WRECK RAIDER: The smallest vehicle beyond the Sea Jet, the Wreck Raider functions presumably as a scout vehicle, or escort. To these ends, it features flick fire hooks that have a 360 degree field to fire in. To propel the vehicle, two&nbsp;propellors that can change direction for reversing, hovering, lowering and so on. There are minor decals - they can be avoided without ruining the look of the set but they do look cool. 4/5</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, the Wreck Raider is a fine set, if a little small, that works best when accompanied with larger sets like the Turbo Sub or the Neptune Carrier. But if you want a set with desirable playability and &quot;swooshability&quot; then this a major contender. 9/10</p>

"Kalhiki","2010-05-15T21:34:35.547Z","My First Atlantis Set","<p>Well, I've picked up my first Atlantis set. First of all, I was never a fan of undersea based themes, but Atlantis seemed cool to me. Therefore I decided to pick up a cheap set.</p>
<p>The building experience wasn't too much. Though I did think the turbines would be double hinged. Instead, one of the conectors in an axle, which leaves&nbsp;that part&nbsp;immobile. The stickers are also pretty nice and add that flare of detail. I also like how Lego is incorporating the set number into the actual model. This one, on the side, has 8-057. </p>
<p>I'll&nbsp;now describe the minifigs. How about... Ace?... first (is that his name?). As with&nbsp;most newer 'figs he has great detail printed on both front and back of his body. His pants are also nice with a trident&nbsp;insignia. On the body there&nbsp;are some shiny bits which really pop&nbsp;out. The head is new and with most new heads they are double sided. And to be noted, he does have that cool eyepatch&nbsp;that everyone wants these days. The helmet is a new piece which has four pin connectors on it in case you&nbsp;want to customize it. The visor has no movement, which is good 'cause I wouldn't want any water in my helmet.</p>
<p>Sharkman has less detail, but what he has is still cool. He has blueish Atlantian markings on the front of&nbsp;him, but nothing on the back. The Shark head is also one solid piece with no minifig head.&nbsp;The head, like Space Police Frenzy, has a hole in the&nbsp;teeth where he can 'bite' objects&nbsp;a 'fig could normally hold. Also, there are more&nbsp;Atlantian markings on his nose.</p>
<p>Any cool or&nbsp;rare parts? Well, there are some nice grappling hooks and turbines. Also&nbsp;the set comes with the cool new Atlantis Treasure Key. This time it's the blue squid key. The minifig is meant to hold it&nbsp;on the trans-blue part of the ring, but the gold area is a little smaller around allowing the 'fig to hold it there as well.</p>
<p>Playability is good. There aren't many gimmicks to this (on the back of the box they called moving the turbines a function). The flick-fire harpoons are cool as they have grappling hooks on the tips. Sadly, the hooks are&nbsp;a loose fit so be careful not to lose them. But you can always&nbsp;have Sharkman attack the sub or the diver as&nbsp;some&nbsp;playability. As for poseability,&nbsp;the flick fire harpoons can go up and down, the tubines can be angled up and down along with the fins on the sides.</p>
<p>I would have wished this was a little&nbsp;less pricey. Maybe $5, but I guess ten isn't... that bad...&nbsp;Eh, whatever. Overall this set is good. If you want an&nbsp;Atlantis set, maybe not put this on&nbsp;the top of the list. If you want something&nbsp;relatively cheap, then sure, pick it up. But I guess I can only mildly recommend this. </p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,3

This set is meant to be a larger introduction than 8072, with a more formidable vehicle and the addition of an 'enemy' minifigure.<div><br></div><h4>Figures</h4><div><ul><li><b>Ace Speedman</b> - Ace has the requisite Atlantis diving apparatus (torso, legs, helmet, neon-green visor, lime green flippers) and double-printed head (one grim and determined, the other side in panic mode).

The harpoon-tipped flick-fire missiles are cool looking s well.</div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>While the part count is a bit low for the price, there are quite a few large pieces so the amount of plastic kind of measures out.

If you're not a huge fan, this set probably won't change your mind, but it still serves as a decent parts pack with some nice minifigs. <br><br>I got this set on a whim, and found myself pretty pleased with the model after I finished building it. The construction is solid, with no extraneous parts and some very nice curves that bring out the overall shape of the vehicle. It looks decent from all angles, and aesthetically it definitely represents the Atlantis theme's strong suits. <br><br>Some rather predictable issues, though, arise with the inclusion of stickers and flick-fire missiles. I'm not usually too hard on stickers, but the very small surfaces on which you're asked to place them make for difficult application and can get frustrating.

Well, guess it's approaching a year since I bought it, but sadly I cannot say I still have it built. To cut to the chase I had it dismantled in a month, not that the pieces have done me a lot of good since. Sorry if I sound critical, but to be honest this set has about as many flaws as it does pros. So rather then just lamely name they out as they come to find, let me list them in an organized manner.</div><div><br></div><h4>Build</h4><div>I cannot fairly say that the build was easy, because at the time I built it in a car, and by the time I had finished I felt on the brink of throwing up. So just a tip, don't build while moving. Anyway, not so much I can say on the general build, it was despite the travel sickness easy and quite unchallenging. To be fair though, I was very happy with the shark, which I must say is quite a nifty figure, but I'll get onto that later. There was only one bag if my memory serves me correctly, and a smaller sealed bag which held the Sharks head piece.</div><p><br></p><h4>Pieces</h4><p>Ah, now this is more of a highlight, as I found myself presently surprised at various newer elements, including a 3x1 flat piece, which I was more then glad to see, despite it's read colour. The shark's head, as I aforementioned, was very pleasing as was the diver. The ring piece was a little under expectations, but nevertheless a plus for me. Then there was the two hooks which are used as the missiles.&nbsp;</p><h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Once again, this was definitely more of an up for me. The shark most especially, with a good overall stature and nice printing design. His legs are somewhat odd, trying to resemble scales of some sort but failing, making it look more like a hobos trousers. The diver was very nice indeed, with a new divers outfit and (Lovely) lime green visor.

"kenhew","2011-06-17T13:04:02.77Z","Very good underrated set","<p>I personally think this is a very underrated set. If you take into account the parts, as well as the design, it is a very good value set that you can incorporate into your mocs. If you don't fancy the colour red, replace it with another colour scheme and you can get a very good decent addon to other themes like space police 3, for example. </p><p>On top of that, the minifigures are absolutely top-notch, the sharkman especially, as well the futuristic diver or whatever you call him. One unexpected surprise is definitely the 1x3 smooth tile...which I know some MoCcers have been yearning for. </p><p>The build is fairly easy and hassle-less, but the best of all, is that it also provides a very good playability value for the younger kids as it's very swooshable, with enough content to create a scenario of the diver chasing the menacing looking sharkman (or vice-versa), this is a very good starter kid for them.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Minifigs - sharkman which is awesome</li><li>Parts</li><li>Playability</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Come to think of it, I really couldn't say any cons about this other than being it may be a bit pricy for such a small set. I got this on discount, so to me it didn't appear to be</li><li></li></ul>
<p>Maybe a bit overpriced for some, but try to get it at discount and you'll be surprisingly pleased with it, if not I still think you should still give it a chance.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sub itself is a very good, solid build and is well worth the effort to pick up, regardless of factors from price, to desired minifigure, Atlantis Collection completion. A blue key ring is also included in this set.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T12:08:55.973Z","We're going to need a bigger sub.","<p>Set #8057 Wreck Raider: This set was a must have in my opinion for two reasons, the first, shark-man Mini-Figure. The second, it's cheap and LEGO Atlantis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wreck Raider is a miniature submarine piloted by one of the Mini-Figures of the Atlantis Expedition, it doesn't take too long to build, it features minimal sticker application and it gives everyone a chance to own the new shark-man Mini-Figure. All of the new Atlantis based aquatic mini-figures are must haves in my book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sub features flick fire missiles with little anchors on them, great for firing on the shark-man and knocking him out so you can claim the Atlantis Key. The shark-man comes with a golden trident weapon, the handle of which seems to be based on a softer plastic than past accessories. I suspect this is so it won't crack or become brittle since there is the whole GPS to consider. (Not Global Positioning System, but Gold Plastic Syndrome.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this set fits in quite nicely with any Aqua theme series, it makes a nice cheap addition to any LEGO Atlantis collection and as an added bonus it gives you the opportunity to have two distinct Mini-Figures, an Atlantis Diver and the Shark-Man. The only thing off about the set I can think of is, that one of the pictures in the instructions cross promoting all the sets would seem to indicate that this one includes a harpoon gun, when in fact it does not. Still I highly recommend it for all Aqua Theme lovers. (I wonder if the Aquasharks of Aquazone mutated into these Shark-Men dudes due to the power of Atlantis?)</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

We have been reviewing for four years and we have reviewed lots of different kinds of Lego sets. We are better at written Lego reviews but if you want to see spoken reviews and more Check out Mrconnor2000 On youtube for Great Lego videos and please rate this review a 5/5.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box on this set showed a Main image on the front and on the back it had alternate images of playability features of the set. The instructions were easy to follow as it has been classed as a easy build set and the instructions also included other Atlantis sets at the back.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Though there are 64 pieces in this set, it only took about 10 minutes to build and it was a easy progress (as i said before.) There were no missing parts.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are two minifigures in this set - the Atlantis diver and the Shark-Man</p><p>Atlantis Diver - The Atlantis diver has a real name which is 'Ace Speeder'. He has the Green Atlantis Helmet which flippers can stick to when you're not using them but a downside to the helmet is that the vidor does not lift up (Like the Iron Man helmet) which would've been cool but i guess the Iron Man setd came after Atlantis so you can't blame anyone really. His Face includes bushy eye-brows, and rubble around his chin. He has an eye-Patch around one eye which clames he has been in alot of wars and he has a straight kind of 'i can't be bothered to do this mouth' and he has the standard Atlantis uniform including a belt with tools and logos.</p><p>The Sharkman - The Sharkman has a molded head and grey skin all over. He has a detailed fin, Very sharp looking teeth and blue eyes. I think he's a great Minifigure.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was easy and exciting and only took us about 10 minutes to build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model included two minifigures (which we've already talked about) and the Wreck raider machine. The machine is red and has&nbsp;<strong>7 stickers!</strong> Thats right seven! i was quite shocked when i saw that this little set had seven stickers but that was in 2010. it was at the end of 2011 when they started stopping stickers. The machine has two propellor engines and an adjustable handlebar. It also has two flick missles and the blue stone that the bad guys want but the good guys need! Altogether a great set!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>We reccomend you to get this set because its great for anybody and everybody! it isnt in shops now but you can definittely get this on E-bay, Amazon or Trade-me for sure!</p><p>Thankyou for reading and please rate this 5/5!</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Sobel","2020-05-01T20:19:40.14Z","If there was an underwater chopper bike, this would be it.","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
This small set once again shows how design can sometimes win over functions and payability, at least for me.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As always with this series, many red parts, slopes mainly, making the sub stream-lined. This is the smallest set (by pieces) to feature one of the circular &quot;keys&quot; of Atlantis, the blue one with an octopus motive. The set has some above-standard parts, like a large engine/turbine-part and harpoon-like torpedoes. Eight stickers have to be applied, which I think is a little too much, but still OK.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two minifigures are included in this set: A diver with greenish gear and a shark warrior who wields a trident.The diver has no additional accessory besides his flippers.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy, from the bottom up. The large propeller-parts are attached during the process in an easy, yet convincing way. Should be no problem building this sub in some ten minutes or less.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished sub is very bulky with a massive front and a tapering rear end. It has two harpoon-torpedoes for defence, steering fins to both sides and two large propeller units for maximum velocity. The diver can hold onto the handle as depicted on this site, but he can also be placed in a seated position when his flippers are removed.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Oh Yeah, it&#39;s the Harley-Davidson of underwater exploration, baby!<br />
This small, yet impressive, sub is one of the coolest of the whole series. Even though it has little to no functions (the flip-torpedoes aren&#39;t really that much of a deal...), it won me just by its look. So massive, so powerful! Reminded me immediately of a heavy Chopper cruising down the freeway. The two big propeller-parts might seem a little OP, but considering the role as a fast attacker they are absolutely justifiable.<br />
That poor lonely shark warrior seems a little lost against this Junior Whopper of a sub!</p>
