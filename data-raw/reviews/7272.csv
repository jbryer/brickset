"Zrath","2009-11-23T02:06:46.53Z","""We're gonna need a bigger sub!""","This set has been showing up sporadically in US Toys'R'Us stores, along with other Atlantis sets.
I just love Lego sharks, don't you?
And this one is nifty!
 
It's some sort of biomechanical thresher shark (look at that tail!) with huge teeth.
Matter of fact, Lego has made larger fangs and included them in this set.
The white ones are used in the large mouth, and the black ones are used as spines on the tail and at the tip of the pectoral fins. I like these new teeth!
The lower jaw snaps closed when you let go of it, thanks to rubber Technic bushings.
The really tall tail moves left and right, and so does the head. The tail contains a new piece, a really long smooth curved double-plate.
The shark is black with yellow and red accents. It's almost Blacktronesque!
 
The minifigure is pretty cool. The new diving suit looks a bit like the spacesuits used in the original ""Alien"" movie: gigantic half-dome visor, oversized chestplate, two big tanks in back, and Technic holes on both sides so you can clip extra stuff to the suit.
I think minifig modders will be delighted.
 
The build is fairly straightforward, though you have to align a couple of Technic rods juuuust right for the jaws.
Only 4 stickers to apply and they look really good.
 
Simple and nice, a must for shark fans, and those looking for black starship parts. :)

"baylego","2009-11-25T17:25:28.013Z","Scary Awesome"," I picked this up along with Rakashi at my local TRU in Colorado. All I can say is that the set is worth much more than $15, and looks amazing when finished.

 The trident is cool, but it seems kind of worthless. The minifig, on the other hand, is awesome! The head gear has a lot of MOCing possibilities, and the fig is printed literally head to toe.

 The shark has a few new parts. There is one very long curved piece on the tail, and there are also some curved pieces with fins. The other ones are black and white long teeth, made with soft plastic. The stickers tie in really nicely, and the snapping jaw mechanism is done with two rubber technic pieces. The tail seems oddly long for a shark, though.

 Overall, especially for only $15, this is a must have. Don't pass this up, or else you will be missing out on one of the best brick built creatures ever!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2009-12-16T13:38:18.967Z","Now that is a mean shark","When the Aqua Raiders came out, the sea life was cuter than it was mean.  This shark says ""Watch Out!""  I think I would give up my career as an Atlantis diver if I came across this guy.

From the tip of the menacing teeth with a snapping action to the giant tail fin, this thing is mean and powerful.  It has great movement, and extra spikes and fins to look like it came out of the deep.

The mouth snapping action uses two rubber connectors, and really closes fast.  It also holds closed well. The mouth also boasts 10 giant teeth, white and gleaming, and perfectly situated to make sure no diver can escape.

The side fins move up and down, as well as backwards.  The extra extensions on the end give a little extra fear factor.

The large end of the tail moves back and forth.  I would have liked to see the whole tail move, but with this design, it is very sturdy.

Overall, the shark does look sort of mechanical.  Not as fleshed out as the Aqua Raider fish and such, but it looks like the style of the theme.

This is a great set for a display set if you do not want to collect the whole Atlantis line.  It can definitely stand alone.  The few stickers that come with it do not even need to be applied.   It is very much worth the price, and proves there are good things to come for the Atlantis line.

The shark is big and black and moves in various places, also its jaws snap shut if you open them. This set also includes many new parts (Diver's helmet, Atlantis treasure, shak fin tips, some of the shark's teeth). This set is very fun to play with and you should get it. Another cool thing it can do is you can flick the diver flying with the shark's jaw. The only thing that bugs me is that the tail only bends at the tip.

"JBH75","2010-01-30T18:49:23Z","Da-Dum, Da-Dum, Da-Dum, CRUNCH!!","At Toys R US today I got this wickedly cool set along with a Manta Warrior set. I gotta say, this set is absolutely great. It includes an awesome giant brick-built Thresher shark (the tail gives it away), a diver, lots of movements like snapping jaws, and a lot of new pieces. There's more to see in the Pros and cons section.

Set Pros:
Diver mini-figure with double-sided head and torso (customary to the atlantis line-up)
diver tank, harpoon gun and lime-green flippers
Red Atlantian Shark Disk (one more to go for me)
Fair Priced
Fearsome Eyes (Old Bohrok ""Eye"" Pieces)
New pieces like larger teeth in black and white, new spine pieces, and huge tail piece

Shark Pros:
Tons of mobility;
Head moves side-to-side
Flippers move in and out, and up and down
Tail fin moves side-to side
Snapping jaws, that snap with an elastic Technc pinholder piece

Cons:
Overly Easy symmetrical build (I like challenges)
Stickers!! (It would look better printed on!)

Overall, this set's pros outweigh the cons drastically, and make the set worth buying. Buy this set if you want to complete your Atlantis collection, get all the disks, or just terrorize your divers with the Shark Guardian.

Thanks for Listening

"Sobel","2020-05-04T19:43:56.167Z","Cool design, but, unfortunately, design is not everything ","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 8-9 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
Here we have another creature of the deep sea threatening the fearless explorers of the unknown. After assembling this set, I came to the conclusion that I&#39;m not that much a fan of building &quot;animals&quot; and things alike from LEGO bricks. But here&#39;s the details.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Several big, rounded parts form the main body and head.There are a few TECHNIC parts like axles and hinges and of course a lot of teeth and fins. For the number of parts, the models turns out to be quite large. It has four stickers to apply, which is OK. Also included is an atlantean mythic disc with, who&#39;d have guessed, a shark motive!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has only one minifigure, an aquanaut with green gear and a harpoon. Seems a little cheap.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The body of the shark is built first, the fins are attached via simple vertical holders. The back fin is made of some TECHNIC parts. The head comes last and is attached via a special joint. The process of putting all the teeth in place can be a bit annoying. All in all an easy build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed shark is over 25cm in length, which is very good for a set with so few parts. The big head has a gaping mouth with a lower jaw that can be opened (it is mounted on two rubber hinges) and a lot of fangs in it.The red eyes give the creature a psychedelic look. The head itself can be moved left and right a little and can be tilted via the special joint to the body.<br />
The body fins can be moved up and down and can also be bent backwards for a cooler look. The huge tail fin can (of course) be moved left and right for steering.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While this set once again looks very cools and also intimidating, it has some major flaws in my eyes.<br />
What&#39;s positive is, as mentioned, the design. Stream-lined, dark, beast-like, aggressive, dangerous. A real threat for every bold explorer of the deep. I&#39;d like to point out the colour scheme which is further supported by the good stickers, giving the creature a mythic/possessed look.<br />
But, well, taking a closer look, the shark is somewhat... artificial. Is it supposed to be some kind of robo-monster? Don&#39;t think so. So that&#39;s what happens due to the small number of parts. Every hinge and joint is clearly visible. The body fins are attached very simply and tend to break off, when the play becomes a little rough. There is also something to the tail fin that bothers me, I can&#39;t really put into words what it is. Also, the lonely diver is somewhat ridiculous, like what should he do? Poke that monster with his shooty-stick? Have you watched Deep Blue Sea??? Some kind of small scooter to at least escape that beast would have been nice. The overall playability is also limited, this set must be seen as an addition to an existing underwater collection.<br />
So, while I&#39;m a big fan of awesome designs, especially with this series, this thing can&#39;t win me over completely. But at least the old saying stays true: &quot;There&#39;s always a bigger fish.&quot; (Qui-Gon Jinn, 32 BBY)</p>

The shark i want to say is about 10 -14 inches long, is mostly black to keep him hidden in the depths of the sea, and has a handful of fun and interactive play features. These include movable fins, a movable tail and best of all a snapping jaw that could stop any diver from reaching the lost city!
