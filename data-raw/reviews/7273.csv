"Alemas","2009-12-13T14:45:01.297Z","8059: A LEGO number I'll never forget","Heh, easy to know why: I must be the first UK person to get an Atlantis set in 2009! Oh well, onto the review: This vehicle has a claw and saw that can go up and down and twist on its ""wrist"", and the saw spins. The flick-fire missiles are very loose, meaning they easily fall out, but they shoot out well. This vehicle also has suspension, and it exploits for the first time a quality found in LEGO pieces: flexibility. The front and rear suspensions flex on arms, and it works very well!
For the minifigs, I really like them, and I even hated them when I first saw them! The diver has a brand new diver's headgear, with a specially-made visor. It also has flippers. The Manta Man has a rubber headgear piece to give it the manta ray look. The disk it also very nice. So, here are the pros and cons:

Pros
- Suspension
- Minifigs
- Saw
- Claw
- Windshield
- Atlantis disk

Cons
- Flick-fires are loose
- Lamp ""disks"" are very weak(they easily get knocked off the arms)

Overall, an excellent set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"JBH75","2010-01-09T21:28:28.797Z","The Power Miner Tires Return with Working Suspension!!","I just got this set in a Wal-Mart today, and I absolutely love it. I'm really delighted with the new Atlantis sets, especially this one. It features a well-designed vehicle with a saw arm, and a claw arm (which features the return of Barraki claws), cool tires and mobility, and great new mini-figures, especially the manta man. For reasons to get this set, here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
Well designed vehicle, with working suspension
Power Miner Tires return
Flick-Fire Missiles, and moving lamp disks
Openable transparent green canopy
Movable spinning saw arm and flexible ""Barraki"" claw arm 
Diver mini-figure with breathing apparatus and lime-green flippers
Manta man with rubbery headpiece, and an awesome head torso
Rubbery trident, and green manta disk
Did I mention the working suspension?

Cons: 
Driver's area has gaps on the underside, and top (isn't bad to have water in the driver's seat)
Flick fires missiles occasionally hit the lamp disks if you don't pay attention

In conclusion, this set is definitely worth $19.99 I paid for it. It has excellent features, great mini-figures, a WAY better claw than the Typhoon Turbo Sub's, and did I mention the working suspension? Just make sure when you get it, you fill in the gaps in the hull!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"oleksoccer","2010-01-25T06:25:28.89Z","Great set","This is my first Atlantis set, and it doesn't disappoint. The Seabed Scavenger has big Power Miner wheels, Barraki claws, and a saw (yay). The cockpit opens and there are two flick-fire missiles. One of my favorite things about this set is that it looks like a lobster, which is obviously what they were going for. The minifigs are great too. The Manta Warrior has a rubber trident and rubber head piece, and the Atlantis Diver has the cool new airtank and visor, as well as a new head that is just the common smiling face with eyebrows but with some stubble. The diver's head also has dual facial expressions. Also, the ship has a working suspension!
Some people are complaining that it is small and that it has gaps in the hull. First of all, this is not that small; it's a good value for $15. Compare it to the Lego City Camper, which is $17. Also, the gaps in the hull would not sink the ship, because it's already on the seafloor (SEABED Scavenger). All in all, this is a great set and I recommend it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"benjadude11","2010-01-21T19:21:41.577Z","but it's so small!","I wanted atlantis to be a good theme. I needed atlantis to be a  good theme. after waking up from the coma I was plunged into after learning bionicle was discontinued, I NEEDED atlantis to be a good theme. I won't pass final judgement yet but so far... meh. 

minifigs: the diver's helmet looks really weird because it cuts off the sides of his face so you can only see his mouth and eyes. (Even without the helmet on the face looks weird. It's too happy.) Manta man, however, is a whole different story. his head and trident are both rubber, and the face underneath the headpiece (which looks like kranxx from space police with serious acne) is light grey, not white, like I thought it would be. 3/5

Price: the set was absolutely dinky for $15 dollars. the picture in the lego catalog is pretty much life-size. 3/5

Build: 15 minutes. too easy. 2/5

Set itself: looks cool, and has a couple of decent features. #1 the wheels. they're like the ones from power miners. #2 the saw blade. looks nice, has great mobility. #3 the shocks. Wow. Shocks. However, because of the way the back wheel is made,the car wobbles when rolled. the claw doesn't really pinch, either. Oh did you know the treasure key has a stud on the back?!?!?!?! go figure. 4/5

Playability: I MOCed up a little castle for manta man, so it's neat to have the car attack it. the missiles don't work very well at all. they fall off easily and the lights get in the way. 3/5

Pros: nice suspension and all terrain wheels

         the evil manta-ray man is well designed and has a nice helmat

<p>The Sea Bed Scavenger is certainly designed to scavenge for things, because it has a claw and a razor wheel, so it's pretty much the best for the job. &nbsp;It possibly could have been made better, because maybe they could have put a tub in the back to store the treasure. &nbsp;I suppose they could have even made it come with some treasure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this set was pretty good to build, it had a decent amount of pieces. &nbsp;I still like bigger sets, though, that take days to build for my entertainment, and have tons of cool features to play with. &nbsp;One good example of this is from the Star Wars theme and is called Hoth Echo Base. &nbsp;The Sea Bed Scavenger is pretty fun to play with, but there's not so much you can do.</p>
<p>I think the value for money was pretty decent. &nbsp;I enjoyed the set quite a bit and still do. &nbsp;I think it was pretty good, it depends on what you think, because after all, this is only my opinion. &nbsp;The overall rating in my opinion was 4.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4

<p>There's a Mantis Warrior with a Green Key Ring. So those collecting up Keys and Mantis Warriors are sure to be pleased. It's with this set that I feel I have more then enough Mantis Warriors and would have liked to see more Shark Warriors easilly gotten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to the main model and vehicle... it does offer a new build different from all of the other Subs found in the Atlantis theme. It's unusual though being a reverse 3-wheeler and two appendages on it for an over sized saw and claw. Not bad for the wheels though as it looks and acts like it's got suspension as it roves over the seabed exploring. It's got a pair of flick missles on it that are starting to feel at times as over done and needlessly put in for the sake of a set with flick weapons.</p>

"Sobel","2020-05-02T21:35:38.357Z","Fresh turn to the submarine-theme. Odd-looking, but quite convincing!","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 8-9 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
On first though, the idea of a ground-based driving vehicle in an underwater series might seem a little off, but the model itself turns out to be quite interesting. As often with this series, the design weighs out the functions and playability of the set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The big black &quot;wheels&quot; were something completely new for me. They look very sturdy and can be used in MOCs in many different ways other than wheels (propulsion device, grinder, turbine...). Also, new parts to me where the &quot;arms&quot; and the claw and saw blade. These two might look a little oversized, but in the deep sea the more power, the better.<br />
Another interesting parts are the flexible bars that hold the wheels. They make the vehicle more all-terrain! The rest are mostly the usual red parts characteristic for this series. Also included is an atlantean disc with a stingray motive.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with two minifigures, a diver with green-themed suit and flippers and a stingray-headed atlantean guard, which carries the usual trident.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The base of the &quot;sub&quot; is formed by two large TECHNIC-bars. The suspension for the wheels is firmly attached to these via special TECHNIC pins. The rest of the model is build from top to bottom upon the bars.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While the chassis of the Scavenger is stream-lined and not very massive, the three &quot;wheels&quot; make it look very bulky. The claw and the buzz-saw can be moved freely up and down and, since they are attached to a ball-joint, can be turned in every direction. The suspension works fine and helps the vehicle go over every kind of deep-sea terrain. The model has two small spotlights in the front and two larger ones around the middle (which might blind the pilot...). The greenish cockpit-window protects the driver from direct harm. A comm-tower sticks out in the back with a flip-torpedo to each side.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Here we see how a small amount of parts can form an almost medium-sized vehicle! Since the idea of an underwater-driving-thing seemed odd to me, I expected not too much of it. Ad oddities it had, like the oversized claw and saw. Also, the &quot;wheels&quot; are SO massive compared to the rest of the sub. But, in a strange way, it all fits! The model manages to keep a rather stream-lined figure while being driven by those massive wheels. The suspension is a big plus and makes this thing super agile on any terrain.<br />
As always, there are a few negative points: the flip-torpedoes are useless and the poor little stingray-guy is COMPLETELY lost against this truck. Also, the antennae-tower that sticks out in the back looks a little odd. It fits a real submarine, but not this ground-based vehicle, at least i.m.h.o..<br />
So, even though it does not have such a great stand-alone play-value it is an absolutely awesome addition to the series and one of my secret favourites.</p>
