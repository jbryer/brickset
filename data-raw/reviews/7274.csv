"Loganwan","2009-12-02T22:15:56.7Z","The First of a Fun Theme","As a new theme, I thought I would grab this set and give it a try and see how good the theme will be overall.   I was a fan of the Aqua Raiders, but got into it just as it came to an end, so I was hoping that more underwater sets would come around again.

This set is very fun to build.  It is a skinny ship, but has two wings that stick out with the turbines on them.  Even though the body is quite thin, the build does not disappoint.   There is a slider that is clipped into place.  When moved forward, the wings flip over to reveal the two hidden tools: a gripping arm and a spring-powered cannon that seems to be in every line these days.  The claw arm does not extend, but does move up and down.  I would have liked to see it be a bit longer and fold in half, so the driver can more easily grab without putting the ship in danger.

The design of the ship is really nice.  It looks like it could cut through the water quick and effectively.  From other pictures of future sets, it seems that the theme will be built on tall ships with the really nice dark red color.

There are not too many stickers, but they add a nice touch of white to a fairly dark red and gray ship.  There are two stickers on each of the long wings that are a little tough to get on straight since they are long, but once on they do give a nice look to the technic/bionicle wing pieces that tend to not be as shiny as the standard LEGO pieces.  

One area that did have a problem was the flick-fire missiles.  They have the really nice new rounded light pieces that are fairly prevalent now, but molded in clear green.  They do not go on the body of the flick-fire missile very well, and are wobbly.  I was afraid to attempt to flick them for fear of the missile coming apart and loosing the good pieces.  It looks like from the box art that the missiles were originally longer with a cylinder piece making up the middle of the missile.  I think I will hunt down a few of the lime green cylinders to help fix the problem.

This is a really nice set, and I am looking forward to more of the vehicles from this theme.  I already want to go back and get the two smaller sets, the crab and the shark, to get ready for the larger sub coming in the next year.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"GameOn99","2009-12-02T23:44:37.42Z","Simply that great.........FO REELZ","This set is simply amazing.  A great first step twords a theme that has amazing potential.  The minifigs are great and are quite origianal.  

For the first time I will do pros and cons as this is a very important first review.  Please look for it down at the bottom if you are in a hurry.

Lets break it down now........yo

<>Figs<>

Look out people, the new age of minifigs (or to use the adopted name for them, the age of Minifigz) is HERE.  The shark head is new and fresh, not the one used in harry potter.  The body is very detailed and the way that the head and body blend togeter is like a work of art.  The new divers helmet is great and was made for exploration under this big sea.  The head is good and serious and he is ready for action.  The helmet is large enough to even be called grand but not to bulky as to not to deprive the minifig of the sitting position.  Over all, supercalifragilisticexpealidocious.

<>the ""specialties""<>

This is a short section about the special pieces within th set.  The ""key"" piece is small but that is good because for a ""key"" object to the story, (ha) that needs to be collected, they are just the right size.  The color on it is good and makes it look cool.  The next and last thing for this section is the trident.  It is a good sized trident that deserves an honorable mention.  It si just the right size for all you can imagine it being used for such as fighting, defending, swinging, jabing, grabing and yes, fishing.  the color on this is good to.

<>The sub<>

*please imagine while reading this, the imperial march, techno style*

This is the main focus of the set and this review.  It is a well designed machine that is not scrawny but it is streamlined to be used for underwater travel.  It is sturdly built.  The way that the mechanism is made to flip the propellers over is made so that it is quick and gan also be done gracefully.  it does flip them fast and provides quick acces to the claw and torpedo.  The claw is g and can grab anything thast comes in reach(not really).  It can hold some things and can even swat atlantians out of your way, it can even help the enviroment by grabbing trash and throwing it into the dispose-all(note: I am not a hippe, this is a joke).  The torpedo is as good and reliable as ever and may even be improved spring wise.  The propeller can be used as a targeting ridacule, BONUS.  The cockpit piece is new to me at least and prvides an exelent view for the driver.  I havn't seen that piece on the back top part in years.  flick fires actually work great.

<>Pros and cons<>

Wish me luck on my first.

"JBH75","2009-12-25T11:23:13.31Z","What up with the claw?","Along with the crab clash, I also got this set for Christmas, and I'm happy (because I asked for the smaller Wreck Raider instead). This set is quite impressive. It features a well built submarine with a surprising function. By sliding a part of the ship's hull forward, the propellers flip revealing a spring-loaded cannon and a ""claw"". The set also has new figures which I'll cover with my pros and cons.

Pros:
Well built submarine (With Castle seige tires in red)
Flick-fire missiles, and spring-cannon
Great function
New diver mini-figure (same as one in crab clash)
New sharkman figure, that is bendable at the snout and fin (and you can put rods through his mouth)
New bendable trident, and turtle disk

Cons:
Red Bricks (Do we really need more?)
The claw? It really isn't a claw but it is just meant to hold the turtle disk (It would probably be more efficient to attach the giant crab onto the ship) (Haha)

Other than the claw (?) this set is fabulous and well-priced at $34.99 Cdn. (I wouldn't know though, I got this for Christmas). This set should definitely be purchased, but if you want the sharkman in a smaller set, get the Wreck Raider, as its $12.99 Cdn (I think.)

"MBlazier620","2009-12-25T11:05:56.81Z","Underwater sets have just become powerful","The typhoon turbo sub is a grand new addition to the lego universe, new pieces, new design, and an excellent theme soon to be just as popular as the power miners. Its sleek design offers an ascetic appearance, and offers a new look to the underwater theme. When you pull the lower lever the engines flip to the back to reveal a cannon and a robotic arm.

"krysto2002","2010-02-17T22:01:27.23Z","Small, but above expectations","<p>I recently purchased this set for $24 US and was rather impressed when I built it.</p>
<p>First let me state that for $25 this set is rather small and could be much bigger for its price, so I'd highly recommend buying it if you can find it for under $25 (say around $20). The sub is very aesthetically pleasing, even though it is bright red, a color much overused in many sets. I'll break this review into 2 parts for everyone.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>1x Atlantis Diver - standard diver, the same as the one from set 8056, Monster Crab Clash. All Atlantis divers wear identical uniforms, from their helmets to their suits so this one is in no way unique. As for a figure overall, the Atlantis divers look great. They have the perfect blend of dark grey and bright green and have a very interesting helmet with a new visor (luckily for the diver, this one does not fold up) and this particular diver also has a double sided face. The head for this figure is currently unique to the atlantis series, so that's a good reason to get one if you like the design. The new helmet is dark grey with two airtanks on the back. There are also two slots on the sides for lights or custom modifications if you're using them for your own creations. The figure naturally has lime-green flippers as well. Unfortunately, the diver has no tools or weapons other than his sub.</p>
<p>1x Atlantis Shark Warrior - another Atlantis-only figure. This figure is also available in another set, 8057, Wreck Raider but alone is a figure I'd be glad to have plenty of. The Shark Warrior has a modified head made from some non-flexible rubber but is still pretty sturdy, I don't think it will break easily. The warrior's head has a small, round slot through which you can insert small bars (the size that fits in standard clips/hands) so they can just as easily hold their tridents in their mouths. Speaking of the trident, it is a very nicely sculpted weapon and is pearl-gold color. The tridents aren't to long like previous helberds/polearms, so they are easily held and posed by figures; the tips are also made from a softer rubber (in comparison to the hilt), so they are semi-flexible and can be bent without breaking. There is also a Key peice, which is a small disk with a design on it (it is much smaller than it looks. The head is also very detailed and has markings on the snout similar to those of the Guardian of the Deep shark from 8058.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
    <li>Both well designed and very cool loking</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
    <li>Both easily obtainable in cheaper sets</li>
</ul>
<h4>Typhoon Turbo Sub</h4>
<p>The obvious highlight of the set, the sub as I've mentioned is a standard red, a much overused color, though very well suited to the theme. As for the design of the sub, the main hull is very thin and much smaller than it looks. As with recent sets, this one has incorporated the use of SNOT to make the body seem bigger, especially on the front and sides. The bulk of the sub is used to house the mechanism used to flip the winhs, but I won't spoil the fun to tell you how. Let me just say that the wings are very sturdy and don't flip when you don't want them to; they snap firmly into place. Unfortunately, while in the forward position (as shown in the picture) the wings tend to wobble a bit.</p>
<p>Each wing has a small flick-fire torpedo launcher, but unlike shown on the box, the heads of the torpedoes do not fully slide into the missile peice and do NOT have a cylinder separating the body of the missile from the tip.</p>
<p>When flipped, each wing has an alternate function, which by now most already know of. One wing has a technic launcher, a great peice for any use, as it fires very well in comparison to flick fire missiles. The other wing has a claw arm, but as others have complained, the claw is to short to grab anything but the main part of the claw can be rotated so that the claw can bend outward rather than upward in which case it actually can grab the atlantis key included with the set.</p>
<p>The sub doesn't have too many sickers like previous sets in other series like Mars Mission. This set only has 6 stickers (yay) but all 6 of them are moderately to extremely difficult to apply (boo). The large stickers on the wings are incredibly hard to apply correctly as they BARELY fit. The radar screen on the control panel is also hard to apply as it is very small and will probably end up crooked.</p>
<p>The front turbines look very cool and house immense propellors. The rear turbine is smaller (it would look better if it was slightly larger) and sticks too far out of the housing. It simply doesn't look right, especially since the propellor is only on one side. I would rather have 2 3-bladed propellors (one on each side) than this one.</p>
<p>The rest of the exterior is well detailed but the interior is rather lacking with just a small radar; no controls of any kind.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
    <li>Well designed</li>
    <li>Cool propellors on the front</li>
    <li>Flipping wings</li>
    <li>Well armed (technic launcher</li>
    <li>Not too many stickers</li>
    <li>uses SNOT well</li>
    <li>Great balance of Technic and bricks</li>
    <li>Most flaws easily fixable with your own peices</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
    <li>Red is slightly overused</li>
    <li>Back propellor is awkward</li>
    <li>Flick fire missiles are just as bad as before</li>
    <li>Claw arm too short</li>
    <li>Wings wobble </li>
    <li>A bit overpriced</li>
    <li>Stickers hard to apply</li>
    <li>Build is too quick for such a high price</li>
</ul>
<h4>Final Verdict</h4>
<p>As a final verdict to this set, I'd say I'm impressed so I give it THUMBS UP as well as an overall rating of about 8-8.5, if you can find it cheaper then it is more of an 8.6-9 but not a 10/10, it has flaws-a-plenty but they can all be easily fixed with some of your own parts.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,3

"vynsane","2010-05-25T14:40:41.28Z","Typhoon 8060 to base... You're not going to believe what I just saw...","This set is on sale at Target currently (from May 23, 2010) for $15, so I jumped on it. I was already interested in it, but the sale turned my interest up a notch or two. The price I paid bumps the 'Value' score up a notch - for full price I would rate it 4 bricks, as it's still a good value at retail price.<div><br></div><div>If the 'Seabed Scavenger' (set #<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=8059-1"">8059</a>) is the workhorse of the fleet, the Typhoon is the quick-deploy attack sub assigned to defend the other explorers. With two huge turbofan propellers and a mainly hollow body structure, you can tell this thing FLIES underwater.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Figures</h4><div><ul><li><b>Axel</b> (Atlantis Diver) - On the flip-side of the stoic and chiseled countenance of a true professional, possibly ex-military man who's ""seen it all"" lies the horrified visage of shock and awe, presumably caused by the creatures who call the realm of Atlantis home (that is to say he has a regular and scared face, opposite each other).</li><li><b>Shark Warrior</b> - Like the figure who comes with 'Wreck Raider' (set #<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=8057-1"">8057</a>) the details on the torso and legs shine through to give the impression of a rough, scaly hide.</li></ul></div><h4>Accessories</h4><div>As with 'Wreck Raider'&nbsp;the diver gets no accessories save for the diver helmet, but the Shark Warrior gets a few items to use.</div><div><ul><li><b>Trident</b> - the Shark Warrior's weapon of choice</li><li><b>Atlantis Key</b>&nbsp;(translucent yellow) - One of the keys to treasure the divers are searching for.</li></ul></div><h4>Build</h4><div>The build on this one is rather intricate, especially where the 'action feature' is concerned. There are some cool tricks used that will inspire, like the gear-driven slide-action that drives the main action feature. There are some cool SNOT techniques used to enclose the cockpit. That said, it's not 'water-tight' (read: gappy) so the pilot will need to keep his helmet on. I guess the bubble canopy is just for protection.</div><h4>Action Features</h4><div>This set is built around a main function - that of the flip-around engine pods, so it plays a key factor in the 'Playability' rating in both positive and negative ways. The way the mechanism is engineered is pretty fantastic, but the way it limits playability (typically as with any action feature) is unfortunate. When I first saw the set, I thought both engine pods were independently movable, like the propellers on 'Wreck Raider', but they aren't - they're ONLY movable through the action feature. Paradoxically, it's a limitation to playability in the pursuit of enhanced playability. You can't point one down and the other one up to simulate a turn, for instance (although I guess that's what the rear prop is for). Once flipped into 'attack mode', however, it brings to bear a Technic missile launcher and a... very short, rather useless grasper arm. I have to admit, I didn't look too closely at the box and was surprised it didn't have two missile launchers, which would have made sense both for balance and playability. The grasper arm is rather uninspired. If you have the means, grab another launcher from your collection or a reseller and replace the arm.</div><h4>Parts</h4><div>There are a LOT of technic bits, which will anger some brick purists, but I don't mind. They come in handy, and it actually makes sense in this case as the lighter the structure is, the faster it can move through the water! The translucent neon green canopy is really cool, and will find its way into many MOCs, I'm sure. The two big red technic panel fairings are cool, too.</div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>This set is a fine addition to your burgeoning Atlantis Explorers fleet, necessary in the hostile environments where divers are in peril of falling victim to all manner of sea creature. After playing around with this I'm looking forward to adding Seabed Scavenger (set #<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=8059-1"">8059</a>) and Neptune Carrier (#<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=8075-1"">8075</a>) to my fleet. That said, I find myself unenthused by the Atlantean faction offerings - the all-black brick-built sea creatures don't look as good as, say, the shark from the Aqua Raiders set 'Tiger Shark Attack' (set #<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7773-1"">7773</a>).</div>",TRUE,3,4,4,4,5

<p>You get an uncommon shark warrior and atlantean diver along with a yellow keyring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's kind of funny, because as you're building this set, you realize it's also designed to be held in the hands. That same design allows for the sub to be set down and displayed without falling over to it's side. As a result, the body of the sub does feel a bit thin. The build of the sub also allows for being able to flip the engines on either side to reveal a claw arm and missle launcher. There are also to small flick weapons on this vehicle.</p>

"giraffefreckles","2011-08-14T15:30:49.91Z","Very Disappointed","<p>Wish the previous review had been available when I bought this set; I would not have bought the Typhoon Turbo Sub had I read it first.&nbsp; Beware gifters: my set had two missing structural pieces and the sticker sheet.&nbsp; Makes for an easier flimsier finish without much pizzazz.&nbsp; (Missing parts/sheet noted to LEGO.com; hopefully&nbsp;on their way soon.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My lesson learned from this set is to look for views from multiple angles before buying; the Brickset database is good for this.&nbsp; The promotional angle for the Sub shows it as its best and makes the whole thing look compact and forceful.&nbsp; In reality, those twin propellor ""arms""&nbsp;project way out there on a skinny stick each, and I'm really not liking the rear ""feet"" of the sub -- they just hang out there looking for an architectural finish.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On functions: Pushing out the little mini torpedos will threaten to destabilize your entire sub, and that grappeling arm is just so bendy (not in a good way.)&nbsp; The big torpedo is neat, though, as it releases on a spring mechanism.&nbsp; The ability of the twin propellors to flip to the back is also set on a classic sliding design, with a&nbsp;cool twist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, the cockpit!&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; There's no way the minifigure fits in there with the cockpit shield closed, and yet, that's what the package shows.&nbsp; Well, it turns out&nbsp;you have to amputate the diver's legs in order to fit him in and get that exact shot.&nbsp; The sharkman has a sturdier ride just standing on the two pegs in front of the cockpit, sticking his tongue out (yeah, he's got a little tongue) and gurgling, ""Nyeah, Nyeah, Nyeah Nyeah Nyeah.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros?&nbsp; I do like the Atlantis ""treasure.""&nbsp; Specialty minifigures are always cool.&nbsp; I like propellors, period.&nbsp; Red adds spice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, I think I decided part of the flimsiness is due to LEGO's decision to incorporate so many technic-like joints rather than outright&nbsp;brick stacking.&nbsp; The whole contraption is shaking on&nbsp;the collective tolerances of the technic connections (and the lack of structural bracing.)&nbsp; Dang it!&nbsp; They need some structural engineers on their design team...</p>

<p>And oh again...&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason I didn't score this thing even lower was because I got it on sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, I'd be really fuming.&nbsp; As it is, I have to&nbsp;seriously MOC this or else tear it apart for the parts&nbsp;pile.&nbsp; </p>",TRUE,2,4,1,3,2
"green_tea","2011-07-17T01:31:55.577Z","Moderate to poor addition to Atlantis series; an overall flimsy model","<p>This set is a barely decent addition to the Atlantis series. Although it adds to your overall brick and parts list to help create bigger and different designs on your own, the structure of this model, when built as designed, is rather flimsy. There are several pieces that pop right off with simple handling. The large turbo engines on either side are weighted badly, and tip down at the propellor end. The ""stand"" pieces are not the best length, and make the ship sit oddly. The cockpit cover does not close all the way down if you have a minifig in the cockpit. And for these reasons I have to say this is by far the least impressive model in this series.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Adds to your overall parts list for original Atlantis designs</li><li>As with all Legos, it is fun to build</li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Model when built as designed is flimsy</li><li>I imagine kids playing with it will have pieces popping off in seconds</li><li>Not very well balanced - looks awkward when on display</li><li>Set is too expensive to buy just as spare parts</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>Just about any other Atlantis set is designed much better than this particular one. Unless you are trying to collect the whole series, I'd save my money and get any set other than the Typhoon Turbo Sub.</p>",TRUE,2,4,4,1,1
"Tim_Johnson","2012-06-05T14:51:54.4Z","Unusual, quite fun.","This is the first Atlantis set I've bought, and I found it unusual in both a good and bad way.<div><br><div><h4>Packaging</h4><div>It's a nice box, not over-cluttered with images. The rear shows the various functions of the set and which treasure comes with this set. The box is glued with finger tabs and the instructions are without cardboard reinforcement. The bags are not numbered. It has a sticker sheet. It also comes with 3D glasses.&nbsp;</div></div></div><div><h4><br class=""Apple-interchange-newline"">Parts</h4><div>The biggest draw for me to this set was the nice variety of red curved slopes/arches. They are used very effectively and make a beautiful shape. There are also decent quantities of red 45 degree ""double"" and ""triple"" slopes. I was pleased to see two red 33 degree ""double"" slopes, which are a familiar piece from my childhood.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm not a minifig kinda guy but I love these two! Naturally these are the two most valuable pieces (in resale terms) in the set, especially the shark head guy. 20% of the parts are at least 10p in BL value, I'm used to only seeing a handful in most sets so that's good - if you like the parts. Have a look at the inventory for ones that take your fancy.</div><div><br></div><div>That said, I wouldn't consider this good value at all at RRP, that price point is way too high. It is now being heavily discounted though (in the UK at least).</div></div><div><br></div><h4>Build</h4><div>I enjoyed the build. As I built I didn't really know where it was headed, and the final result gradually revealed itself which is always the best building experience for me. I had no issues with the instructions and they weren't overly condescending, given this is targeted at minimum 7 year-olds.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As is often the case these days, the build is a mix of Technic core with brick surrounds, but the odd thing is that the brick only really covers the top. The Technic workings are left exposed, as though the sub has a very functional base and a streamlined top. If you half-close your eyes and focus on the red, it is a beautiful model, but overall it feels like a model of two halves.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Playability</h4><div><div>It turns out this is because the Technic section is a handle and 'trigger'. This is GREAT. Sliding the chassis rotates the propeller arms and reveals the torpedo and grapple arm, in a very dramatic and satisfying fashion! I've been doing this on and off for the last few hours so I imagine kids will love it. It lends itself to a climactic face-off with shark guy! The torpedo is also very satisfying, after a constant diet of flick missiles (of which there are two in this set).</div><br class=""Apple-interchange-newline""></div><div>Some have complained the diver doesn't fit in the cockpit. He does, all you need to remove are his flippers. Stick the underside of his legs to the studs below the controls. However, he does almost lie back to fit in! Which doesn't feel realistic.</div><div><br></div><div>There is a pattern at the back of the instructions to view an augmented reality of set 8058. After entering the long, irritating URL there was no AR to be seen. If LEGO are going to include online content, they should ensure it meets the exacting standards they apply to the sets themselves.</div><div><br></div><h4>Summary</h4><p>Kids will love running around flipping the propellers and shooting the torpedo. Atlantis is an imaginative theme. Adults should check out the inventory to see if they like the parts, and only buy if the set is discounted a good amount.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,1
"Sobel","2020-05-06T21:14:14.683Z","""The Flash"" goes sub-aquatic! What a powerhouse!","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
This was the first set of the series, that caught my attention, and therefore one of the few that I bought when they were regularly on sale. I seem to remember buying it for some 20&euro;, which is quite a good prize for a rather medium-sized set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Might have been because of all the red parts (red is may fav colour) that it caught my attention in first place. And this set features them in abundance!&nbsp;<br />
The eye-catcher are obviously the large turbines. Also a nice addition is the spring-loaded shooter on the right &quot;wing&quot;. The main body comprises several TECHNIC parts. Also included is a yellow atlantean disc with a turtle motive. Only six stickers came with this set, which I personally welcomed.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set features two minifigures: a diver with greenish gear and a shark-warrior with the standard trident. The diver, who is dubbed &quot;Axel Storm&quot; has the well-known &quot;Janus-head&quot;.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build starts with the main body and the &quot;flip&quot;-mechanism (more on that below) which uses several TECHNIC parts. This part and the one where you assemble the &quot;wings&quot; might need a little more attention/concentration, since there are some moving parts included. But nothing too complicated for everyone with even the slightest experience.<br />
The rest is basic follow-the-booklet.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The medium-sized sub comes out very slender, yet powerful, not least due to the massive propeller turbines. The arms&nbsp;that carry those have also two &quot;flip-torpedoes&quot; mounted. Behind the left propeller is a small claw arm with little moveability. The right side features a spring-loaded shooter. Behind the - almost completely closed - cockpit is a small comm-tower and a big turbine for maneuvering.<br />
The main gimmick of this set is the &quot;flip-mechanism&quot; (not to be confused&nbsp;with the torpedoes), with which you can turn the arms that hold the turbines 180&deg; by moving the sled you built at the beginning forward. It clicks into place so the turbines face backward and the claw arm/shooter forward.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Obviously, the main role of this bad boy is pure attack/defense-power. While the overall design is stream-lined, the two powerful turbines enable it to surprise the Atlanteans with an attack from out of nowhere or an intervention to defend an operation by the explorers. While facing forward, the engines create a MASSIVE pull to reach absolute top-speed underwater. When flipped backwards, the heavy cannon comes to use and the turbines serve as stabilizers.The mechanism to do the flip is simple, yet well thought through, had me in awe! The whole body of the sub is quite sturdy, but the mechanism and TECHNIC parts used to build it look a little odd and out of place. They take away some flawless, stream-lined design, in my eyes. Also, the strange claw-arm on the left &quot;wing&quot; seems a little cheap, compared to the spring-loaded shooter. And those &quot;flip-torpedoes&quot;... SO unnecessary...<br />
But all in all, this is a very cool set, with clearly better playability than the smaller ones. It has a nice main gimmick, which I never saw before and haven&#39;t seen thereafter. That poor shark-guy is toast...</p>
