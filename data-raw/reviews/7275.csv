"Tommy_60","2009-12-29T14:25:59.2Z","Enter the gateway... and be amazed.","I got this set the other day as a late Christmas present from my grandmother.  I built it with my cousin, which was fun, but she messed up some parts from time to time.  Now onto the review!

Packing:

This set has 3 stickers, which is good, considering the size of it.  It contains 3 bags.

Building:

The instructions are pretty easy to understand.  It was an interesting build, with the tentacles and new minifigs and all.

Pieces: 

As the box says, there are 353 pieces in this set, but I'm not sure if that includes extras, which there are about 10 of.  There are 8 pieces of seaweed, 2 rubber Barraki tentacles, new diver outfits, new squid trident, head, torso, mask, and legs(which are actually tentacles).  There's also 4 jewels, which are green, blue, red, and transparent.  Also included is a gold treasure chest, 4 gold cones, 2 gold gate pieces, 2 yellow rubber bands, and a blue Atlantis squid map/shield!   I found some other interesting slope and curve pieces!  There is also  a new rocky circle piece!

Other Notes:

As the box advertises, there is a trp door where the treasure chest is, but it's not that good.  The door goes UP instead of down, that means that the diver would have to walk into the hole.  If the trap went down, however, the diver could be opeing the chest and then ""WHOOSH!"", he'd plummet to his doom.  The door opening mechanism works pretty well, and it can't operate properly unless the key is pushed down into the rocky circle piece.  You can then open the gates by twisting the rock counter-clockwise.  I have found a problem with it, though.  The rubber bands are smooth, so there is not much traction between it and the wheel it spins to open the door.  I'd reccomend using different rubber bands.  The doors also get stuck by the 1x2 plate with 1 stud and a gold cone on top of it, so I removed them and put one of the plates on the front of the gate's 2 open studs, so they divers would have a harder time to break in.  On the side of the building, the is a white squid on a hook, who's tentacles can be used as a cage for an unsuspecting diver.  It could be a trap with a neat design, or an actual squid!  You can make that decision yourself!  The larger squid can be placed on the top of the building as a monument, or you can take it off and use it as the real thing!

Summary:

All in all, the set is amazing, despite the piece/price ratio, and it can be used for hours with no boredom!

I reccomend this set to anybody who likes Lego's, you'll have a blast! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The giant sqid guardian is awesome and the smaller squid is a nice addition too. Most of all though, the octopus warrior is amazing with its exclusive and one of a kind torso. I can imagine all the mocs this will apply to, Also, the diving apparatus is a nice addition and is quite detailed. One complaint I have is the gateway itself. Why would there be treasure if the Atlantis divers are going for keys? Also, the figures don't fit too well in the squid jail.</p>

"parchioso","2010-03-10T09:42:27.717Z","Not very good except the minifigs, especially the very cool Squid Warrior","<p>The minifigs, especially the very cool Squid warrior are excellent, but the rest are disappointing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The squid body and claw do not appear realistic to me, same for the smaller octopus, I understand it may not be easy to design these two sea creatures, but in such forms I just feel that they look odd, the octopus looks more like a white spider to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The color mix of the temple is a strange contrast of gray and tan, which does not look harmonious. The mechanism to open the gates through rubber band is hard to use, wouldn't using technic parts provide a smoother movement? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Lego is very smart in providing the colored keys, many would be tempted to buy more Atlantis sets to collect all 5 colors, but I feel that there are poor designs in some elements, which&nbsp;may weaken the value of the theme despite having very cool minifigs.<BR></p>

"jatonaz","2010-12-29T12:43:20.527Z","These are the squids you're looking for.","<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>
<p>Atlantis, the really well thought-out continuation of the Aqua theme. Giving names and faces to&nbsp;good guy/bad guy&nbsp;themes has always&nbsp;worked&nbsp;in the past, and&nbsp;when you think about it, it's actually quite surprising they didn't&nbsp;apply it sooner on the Aqua-related themes. Close to twenty sets&nbsp;this year plus countless tie-ins (including an animation&nbsp;short and books)&nbsp;really shows you how aggresively Atlantis was marketed. </p>
<p>However, I was not impressed by this theme at first glance. Sure, the creatures looked cool (especially&nbsp;8079 Shadow Snapper), not to mention the awesome trio that is the monsters minifigs, but the vehicles all looked&nbsp;pieced together&nbsp;to me. The only set I was interested in before 8078 Portal of Atlantis came out was this set.&nbsp;Seeing it on discount I bought it, and just had to write this review for people who still haven't jumped the Atlantis ditch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigs/Parts:</strong></p>
<p>The divers are just like every other diver in the series, and you can see what they look like in the pictures here so I won't elaborate. The squid warrior is pure awesomeness. Plastic wrapping over his already insane looking face with nice tentacle legs. The mask is cool for any minifig, and when lined up together with the Space Police III&nbsp;baddies you have&nbsp;a&nbsp;""good""&nbsp;looking&nbsp;line up of monsters. You can only get him in the much more expensive Portal of Atlantis and the hard-to-find Atlantis book, so he is quite valuable.</p>
<p>The parts in this set are really good. Full of dark grays and tans (very Castle friendly),&nbsp;various slopes, knobs, mechanics and&nbsp;the really nice gates.&nbsp;Of course, the giant squid&nbsp;and&nbsp;squid prison are chock-full of robot arms, teeth, horns, and tentacles.&nbsp;The price I got this set at makes the pieces much cheaper than if I had gotten them seperately. The elements are all pretty useful and I'm banging my head for not getting a second set of this just for parts. Even at original price, I find the parts to be of&nbsp;above-average&nbsp;value (so so so rare these days with 2010 pricing), so a definite 5-bricker here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>
<p>As always, I'll separate it into parts as per instruction booklet.</p>
<p>White Squid Prison: Although I don't own 30040 Octopus, they look like they are of the same build. White robot arms connect horns as tentacles. Good creative use of the pieces, much like the Spy Clops of the Agents theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giant Squid: Large tubular pieces for the body of the squid, with good stickers for decoration. This is an instance where it's better to have stickers, because it would be hard to use the printed pieces for MOC. The ""mouth"" has a build somewhat like the tentacles of the white squid, but is connected to a 4-studder on top of the squid that allows for movement. Not much purpose if you ask me, because the only movement you need is the teeth, which serve their function of&nbsp;eating minifigures okay. The longer tentacles are probably of no use except to the more&nbsp;creative MOCers, but the four shorter ones made of tail and horn pieces are welcome additions to any collection.&nbsp;The squid&nbsp;was ""slimmer"" than I though,&nbsp;but overall a good build, something I believe both kids and AFOLs will like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Main Gate: The ground level is actually separated into two parts, the first being the main gate. An Atlantis ring on top of the knob will ""open"" the really nice gates. Beneath the decks are rubberbands on coils that turn the gate. Must say this function really stinks. The gates&nbsp;rarely turn&nbsp;at the same pace-you have to constantly adjust if you want the gates to close and open at the same time. They also do not always&nbsp;move when you turn the knob. I'm not ""Technic""ally gifted so I don't know how to fix this except removing the rubberbands and doing things by hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Treasure Plank: One word: Hollow. Not in a negative way though.&nbsp;There is a floor trap where the&nbsp;golden treasue chest sits, so&nbsp;the build is&nbsp;hollow to accomodate the fallen diver.&nbsp;Of&nbsp;course I would've loved more plates&nbsp;for my buck, but the build is quite sturdy, compared to another hollow set,8191 Lavatraz (which I reviewed earlier). The plank is pretty much what you see in the picture, with a pole protruding from the side that allows you to hang the small white squid. What you can't see is a technic rod that&nbsp;sits&nbsp;sticks out the&nbsp;top of the back wall and&nbsp;allows you to sit the giant squid on&nbsp;top. I loved this design as it makes the set look amazing when displayed. However, when the kids are playing with it the&nbsp;rod looks out of place, as the squid is always held in hand. You can always remove it and place it later on, so not too bad, just wanted&nbsp;to tell you guys. </p>
<p>Overall, the entire floor level is a plain build, no oohs and awes when constructing. Weakest part of the building experience, and the part that the adult should probably take on if it's a family build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>
<p>Finished product looks great for display&nbsp;and&nbsp;has high playability as well. The giant squid,&nbsp;removable small squid&nbsp;and minifigs are definitely the stars of the show. The plank and gate seem&nbsp;to fall out of favor with kids quickly. I would rather they make a smaller gateway and give the divers a small vehicle like they have in every other set. I currently place the set with&nbsp;8057 Wreck Raider and 8073 Manta&nbsp;Warrior minifig pack, and they look awesome and play well together. This set is good on its own, but five bricks when you add even just one smaller set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong></p>
<p>At the original price it's&nbsp;about&nbsp;4&nbsp;brick. I know I've been singing praises&nbsp;about&nbsp;this&nbsp;set, but&nbsp;when I look at price I not only look at&nbsp;the&nbsp;price per piece but also the whole experience and design. The big pieces and nice minifigs make up for the over $0.10-per-piece, but the gateway itself is a bit bland and feels like a lazy design, so I have to take away a brick. However,&nbsp;this set has been on discount everywhere&nbsp;during the holiday seasons of 2010. With 30%~50% discounts this set gets&nbsp;full marks. It wasn't really overpriced to begin with, and any discounts you might find makes this set a must-get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>This is the perfect set to get into Atlantis. It's mid-priced, has good playability, good AFOL value (display, MOC), and it's much better compared to getting just a vehicle or fish monster. One of the better&nbsp;bang-for-your-buck&nbsp;this&nbsp;year in my opinion. If this set or the more expensive 8078 Portal of Atlantis* doesn't get you interested in Atlantis (although all the subs&nbsp;STILL look&nbsp;weird to me), then I believe this theme is not for you. I truly hope the hesistant don't miss out on this&nbsp;worthy set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Got 8078, put it in my room. Came home, found my mom trying to act innocent and saying ""It looked really cool, so I though I'd have some fun."" Had really wanted to review it because so few people had done so. Oh well, she said it was a good build. It looks VERY nice, and has a lot of good functions and gimmicks, it must've been at least four bricks in every catagory in my book, so there. I've fullfilled my&nbsp;wishes of&nbsp;reviewing 8078. Hurray.</p>

"AETerry","2011-01-19T22:21:53.75Z","Gateway of the Squid Review","<p>When I first saw that the Atlantis sets were coming out, this set is what immediately drew my attention with the Squid Warrior Minifigure. The rest of the build was good looking too from the box art.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At $39.99, it feels like it should have been less, especially once you put it together and are looking at it's overall size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get 3 minifigures, 1 Squid Warrior (a must have) and two Atlantean Divers. There's a blue keyring that fits into a lock that when you twist it opens the gates to the golden treasure beyond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So while the gate concept is good, it doesn't always open properly like it should. Plus if two gold cone pieces would have been moved forward one or removed from the design, I'd feel the gates could close properly all the way. There's also argument too that the Divers could just swim around the gates to the treasure, but this calls, I believe for the ""suspension of disbelief"" with imagining that there's rocky walls on either side of the gates that would prevent swiming around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the gates is a gold treasure chest with some gemstones within. There's also something a booby trap that flings the unsuspecting minifigure upwards into the mouth of the giant squid I presume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Off to the side is a white squid cage to hold a diver prisoner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above the set and having a little technic pole jut out to support it, a giant lego squid can be placed down to rest/complete out the set. The squid while mainly black with neon green highlights feels like it's missing something. And it's not just that it only has six arms instead of eight. Sure it could use an extra pair of arms. But the body feels it should be longer and shaped more how a squid does look and instead of more rounded like an octopus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, it does look good for setting up and displays. I certainly had some people who aren't Lego enthusiasts that were impressed with the model when they saw it. And it was more then a polite nod and looks of ""you haven't grown up yet?"" One of them even played with the set a bit.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"wander099","2011-04-10T16:25:27.887Z","A bit pricey, but still a good set","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I think that the box is larger than it had to be for this set, but the graphics are good and makes the set look very attractive.&nbsp; It comes with two instruction booklets, and I think that this was unnecessary given the complexity of the model and the number of pieces.&nbsp; One book would have been sufficient.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set comes with a lot of great parts.&nbsp; You get some uncommon pieces as well as quite a few seaweed pieces, a gold treasure chest, and of course the parts for the squids (the large black one and the small white one...or is the white one an octopus?)<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>In this set, you get three minifigures: Lance Spears, Samantha Rhodes, and an Atlantis squid warrior.&nbsp; Both Lance and Samantha come with double-sided heads and the same SCUBA gear (flippers, tank/helmet, spear gun).&nbsp; But in my opinion, the best minifigure in this set is the squid warrior.&nbsp; I love the red colour and all the painted details, it looks really great and I just love the tentacle piece that replaces the conventional legs!&nbsp; He also comes with a gold trident.&nbsp; Word to the wise though, once you put the squid head over the regular minifigure head, it won't be coming apart again.&nbsp; Those two pieces are stuck together for good.&nbsp; So make sure you get the eyes lined up with the holes the first time around.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build wasn't too difficult.&nbsp; It's pretty straightforward.&nbsp; The only real problem I had was with getting the elastics on the gate opening mechanism.&nbsp; But it wasn't a big problem for me.&nbsp; Younger children will likely have trouble, but an adult can easily assist with that step.&nbsp; Additionally, there are three stickers that go on the black squid.&nbsp; They are annoying to place, but I was able to get it right with a little time and care.&nbsp; This is another step children will probably want/need help with.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model is somewhat smaller than I expected it would be, but I do enjoy it all the same.&nbsp; The squid is my favourite part of the set, it can be placed atop the pillar and is easily removed for play.&nbsp; The white squid/octopus at the side can imprison one of the divers, making for a fun play experience.&nbsp; The gate mechanism could have been better, the movement is jerky and uneven, but it gets the job done.&nbsp; There is also a trap door that flips up, hiding the treasure chest, but on my model it is very stiff and does not come down without being pushed back.&nbsp; I don't know if this is the case across the board, if it is just my model, or if with play the stiffness will ease up.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>For $55 CDN, I honestly expected a little more or at least better working features/more minifigures (or even, just a few more pieces to make the set bigger).&nbsp; However, if you are a big fan of the Atlantis theme, then I would still recommend getting this set.&nbsp; In my opinion, it is one of the better ones from the sets released in North America so far (I don't like a fair number of the other sets in this theme).&nbsp; I would also recommend buying this set if you can get it on sale for a better price (I got mine buy one get one half off; the other set I got was the Portal of Atlantis (8078), and I will review that set later).&nbsp; <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,3

"Sobel","2020-05-18T17:29:55.323Z","A nice piece of underwater scenery with an awesome monster squid!","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
This set here once again puts me in the position, where I&#39;d like to chose between half and full stars in the rating. For me, it ranges between three and four stars, so something that is quite OK, but with several major flaws, as I&#39;ll point out.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Here we get a LOT of special parts such as the various tentacle parts, fangs (in abundance), the gates, sea weed and a treasure chest. Several large baseplates can also be put to good use in MOCs. An atlantean disc in blue with a squid motive is included, as well as some rubber bands for the gate-opening mechanism. This set has only three stickers, which is very nice, since I&#39;m not a big fan of &#39;em.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three minifigures are included, which is appropriate for a set this size. This set is the first one to feature two explorers, a male and a female one. They have the usual greenish gear and harpoon each. The male one has a two-sided head, with one side smiling and the other showing fear.<br />
The third minifigure is an atlantean squid guard with a VERY cool design! The massive squid head is impressive and reminded me heavily of Davy Jones from &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; and looked even better than with his <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/poc031/davy-jones"">minifigure </a>from one year later! The minifigure-head underneath that is very scary with glowing read eyes and a gaping mouth with fangs. He wields the usual trident.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Due to the special mechanics of the gate, the&nbsp;build can be a bit tricky here and there. Really nothing to worry about for a skilled builder, but again, younger LEGO explorers might need a little assistance.<br />
The build starts with the small white squid, which is easy, yet a little repetitive. The large squid comes next, still being rather easy. Just be aware of the right placement of&nbsp;the tentacles on the TECHNIC Beam Triangle part, so they go in the right direction. The next part is the &quot;entrance way&quot; with the gates. It houses a rather simple mechanism with two counter-rotating rubber bands (one remains straight, one has to be twisted) which go over several reel drums turned by the grey stone tablet in connection with the blue disc on top of the entrance. Extra care has to be taken with this part, still, it is quite manageable. At least, the main structure of the &quot;temple&quot; is built. This one is just simple bottom-to-top with some additions left and right and the simple trap-door built on the way. Simple, simple. The two pieces of the scenery&nbsp;are connected via TECHNIC pins.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When finished, this model presents you with a medium-to-large piece of underwater scenery with quite some functions. Overshadowing it all is, of course, the giant black squid. This thing is massive, with its&nbsp;body and tentacles stretching longer than the whole scenery. The four shorter arms can be moved in various positions, the fang-armed mouth can be rotated by turning the stud at the back of the head (odd...). The squid&nbsp;itself fits loosely on a red TECHNIC axle at the top of the temple. It has no real hold and swings left and right easily.<br />
The smaller squid is attached to some kind of cantilever where it dangles around, but can also be easily removed.<br />
The main structure is of medium stability, if carried around, caution is advised. When built correctly, the mechanism to open the gates works nicely. The gates themselves don&#39;t close completely straight but remain a little pushed inwards. That is normal, so no worries here. The trapdoor-mechanism of the main part catapults the treasure chest backwards, out of the reach of scavengers. The colour-scheme gives the whole set an overall realistic look with everything being held in shades of brown and bluish grey.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, this set had me swaying between three and four stars overall. It has quite some nice parts, some small challenges in the building process and one&nbsp;interesting main&nbsp;function (the gate), the mechanism of which can also be put to good use in own creations. Also, the colours and overall scenic design appeals to the eye. The squid guard is a very cool minifigure the likes of which I have never seen again in another series. This set, while not being the absolute must-have standing for its own, is a very nice addition to the whole underwater-theme and especially the Atlantis-theme.<br />
On the downside, this set is one of those &quot;odd&quot; sets, like I often refer to them. You know, there is this BIG massive squid perched atop of this small, fragile looking temple protecting a treasure with just some gems. Next to it is its small&nbsp;albino cousin impaled and presented like an exhibit. And all that is protected by an INSURMOUNTABLE gate of maximum security, which extremely reminded me of this one...<br />
<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/3765/11469516704_5980511670_n.jpg"" style=""width: 320px; height: 214px;"" /><br />
You see? Sounds a bit ridiculous, doesn&#39;t it? Also, the complete structure is a little unstable here and there with some parts easily breaking off. The divers can only be placed loosely somewhere on the scenery if you want them to keep their flippers on.<br />
In conclusion, I would not wholeheartedly recommend this set, but if you&#39;re in for the parts and some addition to your underwater scenery, this is your choice.</p>
