"Gerrant","2009-12-19T16:17:06.263Z","Very Playable","I got this set via Bricklink, I have no idea how the shop had it – or if they were supposed to let it go – but they did (glee)

Right – Mild bias, I collect Lego Submarines so it’s going to be a set I am kind to on review.

Basic concept, largish main Sub with two dockable mini-vehicles. The set is like the recent Aqua set that didn’t have a matching set of ‘bad-guys’. Each set has its own opposite minifig/creature. Some sets have a large creature, most have a Atlantis machine with this collectable ‘thing’. :D

The set builds nicely and feels well, if sparsely, designed. It sits firmly upright with or without the car docked. The car dock is positive and its firmly gripped in the main sub when fitted. You can have the minifig sitting in it if you wish.

The small sub locks on the back and again doesn’t affect the balance of the sub. Both dockable are nicely designed and work well.

The main sub cockpit has a very large cover, it’s not hinged which is a bit cheap – further – you cannot sit a minifig in front of the pilot, so the huge cockpit is only viable for one Minifig & storage of flippers. This is fixable by moving the control display back one stud, and then there is plenty of room.

On the main sub the mid section allows both sides to open and you can fit a minifig in the middle, Its very fiddly though.

Stickers – a lot. I don’t mind as such BUT until they stop cracking up over time and LEGO don’t sell replacements – BOOOO

Four minifigs, three submariners & one sea creature. Very nicely designed with steam punk look. Faces are double sided like exo-force for the surprised looks. Also comes with buildable stingray with glow-in-dark bits – this is well designed.

Colour is good, rich Red with Dark Gray along with a sprinkle of Green.

Bottom line: I built this and my 8-year old daughter has not stopped playing with it yet – so it passes the playability test.

I will be getting more – I can’t help feeling though that as the largest Atlantis Sub it’s not the ‘Top’ set you would expect from a range, so I assume there will be more. I also think there is not a large ‘Baddy’ set at all in the range (yet)

"Duq","2010-08-23T20:16:32.5Z","A very playable parts pack","I bought this set for parts but I tend to build everything I buy and this was a pleasant surprise. What's not very obvious from the set picture above is that you actually get 3 vehicles here.<br><br>In the box are 4 bags. The first bag is for the small vehicles, the Manta and the minifigs, the other three bags are for the main vehicle. There is a car which is the weakest part of the set design. It's just not very pretty and there aren't many parts. Next is a James Bond style under-water scooter. It's a cute design with red curves, two harpoons and propellors. The Manta is a simple but effective design with some nice parts like the triple curved black slopes and glow-in-the-dark Bionicle spines.<br>The three divers have reversible heads; one side has a confident face, the other side has a scared face. It's a nice idea but with the diving gear on it's not easy to turn the heads around. The last minifig is an odd character with a grey face, a manta on his head and Neptune's fork in his hand.<br><br>The main vehicle is a fairly big clever contraption. It uses lots of red curves, Technic pieces and hinges to create an interesting shape. The curves of the bottom section are made of two halves of a cement mixer and two Technic panels open up to reveal tools. The scooter snaps on to the back. The really clever bit is the bottom half which opens up to store the car.<br>There are a few stickers but they don't go across multiple pieces and they're not essential for the looks of the set. An odd choice is a pearly-gold curved slope that's almost completely invisible.<br><br>For a non-licensed set it's kinda pricey but for children there's a lot to play with and for builders it's full of interesting parts.

"atperratore","2010-02-06T16:51:25.607Z","Chambers, Greebles, and Flashlights mounted to some dude's head.","Minifigs:

The set contains 4 minifigs. The Atlantis divers are very well detailed, though identical in every way except for head printing (Except for Bert... he's been sticking flashlights in his ears ever since they made him ride at the back... Don't laugh at his issues.) The Manta Warrior also has some excellent chest an helmet printing (None on back or legs.) However, the repetition of divers gets rather annoying after multiple Atlantis sets, and the Manta Warrior can be found in other sets as well.

Manta Ray:

Small and well designed. The glow-in-the-dark fins are a nice touch.

Buggy:

Looks almost like a Mars Mission rover in red. It's pretty nice, though. The front is especially well-designed, and the trans green slope as a winshield is new to me.

Carrier:

Overall the carrier looks good, with nice details and greebles all around. Smaller than I'd imagined, especially for a $60 set. For a set similar in shape to the 2006 Slave 1, the Neptune Carrier is smaller, has fewer pieces, and is more expensive. However, it has some nice design features to make up for this. The opening feature in the front is very smooth, and does a good job of hiding the little exploration buggy when closed. It looks much better from the front than the back, where it's easy to see the chamber is not at all airtight. The cockpit is large and spacious, and can fit two divers if the control console is moved forward several studs. The compartment below this, however, is rather lacking. It houses a control console in the back and tools/harpoon guns in the technic panels on the sides, but is extremely cramped. It is impossible to have a diver stand perfectly straight here, and the use and arches makes it  impossible to have more than one diver standing at all (And difficult to fit more than 1 diver, period.) The panels do not go all the way down to the floor, so feet are very visible. This also puts the hinge in a strange spot, making it difficult to bring divers in/out The propeller area looks nice and smooth, and the propeller can rotate 360 degrees. Lastly, the minisub clips onto the back, allowing you to drag your last diver along at impractical speeds that deepen the insanity that caused him to mount flashlights onto his head in the first place. The sub is well designed, and gives off the ""Atlantis"" feel and design well.

Pieces: 1 x 3 plates, the new trans green canopy and buggy windshield, and the red silo things on the side are the one ones that pop out to me, besides the trans green flick-fire tips. A good source of red. Oh, and the gold ring, which is exclusive to this set. This one is green, and has a manta ray.

Minifigs: 6/10

"AETerry","2011-08-26T13:47:56.143Z","Neptune Carrier Review","At long last, despite a budget short fall and the wonders of a birthday, I have finally gotten a hold of this set. Price wise I got a good deal even with shipping &amp; handling to be able to get this for less then the original retail value. I think, even if I had gotten this at full retail, the price is still very good for a set this size.<br><br>There are four minifigures in this set, 3 Divers and then 1 Mantis Warrior. The Mantis Warrior is a welcomed addition as I have been loving the design on all of the aquatic minis for Atlantis. The Divers are alright. As this is 2010, they've got the characteristic neon green fins and dive suits. Each of the figures also has a reversible head with one side showing a serious expression and the other with a worried or scared look.<br><br>Next in line are the three mini builds with this set. The first of which is the Mantis with a very cool &amp; good design, use of pieces with the dominent black use of bricks and the white highlight bricks. It's a very quick and easy build. The neat part to it is the use of the glow-in-the-dark spines. The other two mini-builds are for a very tiny sub that you can see on the picture of the box, but doesn't make it clear that it can detach and come away. The other mini-build is little red seabed rover for exploration along the seabed floor.<br><br>The main model, the Neptune Carrier is modulated and will be built in parts with each of the different numbered poly bags. Now it may have been my particular bag of bricks in question, I did have some problems with the ""snap"" effect for getting the bricks to stick together, but once in, they hold. They will just be very snug, more so then usual. In the end, I am just very delighted by the build of this sub and the surprises of all of the features that are part of it. The main one being that on the sides of the sub where the numbers are at, the flaps fold out and you have effectively a little cargo, computer station complete with tools and harpoon weapons stored there for the divers.<br><br>This set ends up being well worth the wait for me and finally getting a hold of it for my collection. Fans of the Atlantean theme are sure to love this one and I can see kids having hours of fun with a set like this. I mark down the playability here due to the fact that Atlantis is an aquatic theme and many of the models are set for being underwater. The rest is high marks for me due to the beauty of this model from technicals to aesthetics and kids getting a hold of a set like this to play with. This set will be proudly displayed with the rest of my Atlantis theme collection.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Sobel","2020-05-27T21:53:26.467Z","This baby spells IMPRESSIVE with every single brick!","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
This impressive sub was an absolute must-have for me as an old Aquazone-fan. Luckily, I got it on a special B-stock&nbsp;sale for a good price! As with several sets of this series, the overall rating depends heavily on what you focus on: design or playability/functions. As always, I focused more on functions, while also putting a reasonable amount of attention to the design. So, here we go.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set offers a large variety of parts, mostly red, of course, in all sizes. We have a few TECHNIC parts for the internal structure, standard bricks, plates and hinges for most of the chassis and large parts for the outer structure. What caught my attention in particular was the large green cockpit part and the two shell parts that house the two turbines. These two can be combined into one extremely large booster/turbine part for MOCs! Two glow-in-the-dark parts and a&nbsp;green atlantean disc with a stingray motive are&nbsp;included, as well as twelve&nbsp;stickers, which is&nbsp;still OK for a set this size.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Included in this set are four minifigures, which is a good amount. Three male divers, all with two-sided heads, form the crew of the large sub. They sport the usual greenish gear, while one of them has two small spotlights attached to his diving suit. Two harpoons and some tools are also provided.<br />
The fourth minifigure is the well-known manta-warrior with his trident. This guy seems to be some kind of standard foot soldier for the atlanteans...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building starts with the small additional vehicles and the black stingray-monster.<br />
After the ray, the scooter and the wheeled rover are finished, construction of the internal structure of the sub commences. After the basic structure with the moveable side parts is finished, the cargo area on the lower side is built. The large engine section is built separately and attached via TECHNIC pins. The model&nbsp;is finished by closing the cockpit and putting together the &quot;tail&quot;. All in all, still quite straightforward, while unexperienced builders might have some trouble putting the different sections together the right way.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The large, bulky sub has an impressive look to it. The front houses the big engine section, all with cylinders and exhaust vents. Several green and white spotlights point forward. The lower front has a large openable hatch, which also serves as a garage door and ramp for the small ground vehicle.&nbsp;The two large sides of the submarine can also be opened by moving them backwards, giving easier access to the small vehicle. This four-wheeled car of sorts has two levers for steering, oxygen tanks and two small grippers in the front.<br />
The mid-section holds some sort of engine room/laboratory/utility bay, with room for one minifigure. Directly above this place is the cockpit, which is almost completely sealed tight. Two fins secure stability and hold four flip-torpedoes.&nbsp;<br />
The back has a large propeller that moves in all directions, probably for fast steering and maneuvering. All to the back, the small scooter is attached. This thing bears some resemblance to the main vehicle in its bulkiness. It has two propeller-turbines and two harpoons for defense.<br />
The additional stingray-monster looks a little odd, but has two glow-in-the-dark extensions in the back.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This enormous underwater vehicle surely has more purposes than just peaceful exploration. Even though its armament is not that impressive, the sheer looks of this bad boy are sure to shake some nerves! The many functions and additional vehicles also give it some sort of mobile-base-like feeling, maybe even a little more than the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8077-1/Atlantis-Exploration-HQ"">original HQ</a> itself!! I am thrilled by all the possible ways you can play with the different vehicles, minifigures and tools! Really a great idea, implemented in an impressive fashion. Speaking of fashion, I really liked the design of the engine part. Looks quite realistic and gives a feeling of power and the force that is needed to propel this massive sub forward. Another positive aspect is the number of minifigures, which are essential for some good playing.<br />
Once again, what kept this set from getting full five stars are flaws in the overall design, even if the sub looks very good. There is this part in the central section of the sub, where the lab/engine room thing is located. The hatches to both sides close in a very awkward way, so almost half of the room is still open to the outsides. Why not place the hatches one brick-level lower and/or make the hatch-pieces bigger? That way, the inner area would have been better protected and the lateral looks of the sub would have increased a LOT! Also, the large propeller in the back dangles around all the time. Was there no way to fix it at the top of the &quot;loop&quot;? I dunno, but all this seems a little... lazy to me...<br />
BUT still: what an awesome set! What a cool design! What many functions! I&#39;d&nbsp;surely recommend this to every fan of LEGO subs and all things Aquazone.</p>

"Fauch","2015-02-14T22:15:02.083Z","cool vehicle, unremarkable minifigs","<p>Parts</p>

<p>A nice selection of parts, especially for buildings vehicles obviously, lots of slopes and curves, blades, also wheels and a car base, a huge cockpit piece, 2 technic panels, 2 massive technic half-cylinders, lots of pieces for snot builds, glow in the dark plants...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The weakest part imo. Divers are great, they have backprinting and double sided face and lots of equipment, but are basically the same as in every other atlantis set. The manta warrior felt below average, no back printing or double sided face, also, maybe it&#39;s because I got an used set, but the rubber piece that goes on his head doesn&#39;t fit correctly.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t build that many vehicles, and it was my first submarine since aquazone, in 1995 I believe, so it was quite a different build. Lots of snot, a bit of technic, the design is kind of interesting, especially that little bay for the car, with a ramp that can go down and sides that can expend.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a big submarine, possibly around 30cm in length and not far from 20 in height, it also hosts 2 other mini vehicles, a car, and a mini-sub attached under the tail. It also comes with a buildable manta, not sure if it is a monster, or a vehicle for the manta warrior, so it offers quite a bit of playability, though I&#39;m not sure the manta warrior really stands much chance, so I think it would be better if you could complete with some sets more centered on the baddies (I got it to go with portal of atlantis, because divers don&#39;t get much in this set). A bit disappointed that the huge cockpit only has room for one diver.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice set. The retail price of 60&euro;, I would say is too high, it should be 40-45&euro; considering minifigs are nothing special at all. It is possible to get it cheap on bricklink (or at least was, mine cost 15&euro;). the 3/5 mark is for the retail price. For under 30&euro;,&nbsp;I think it would be a 5/5</p>

<p>The build: I didn&#39;t actually build this. Though looking at it there are some interesting parts including the green cockpit and large red hull parts on the sides of the twin front engines which houses the small car/buggy thing(which I&#39;ll get to later) and of course how could I forget about the glow in the dark parts on the sides of the brick built manta. Other than these now uncommon parts no techniques stand out to me personally.</p>

<p>The minifigs: three divers, two of which have exclusive face prints to Atlantis and a manta ray minifigure hybrid(which was common for Atlantis). All in all good figures.</p>

<p>Play/display: This primarily being a playset focused on children, play is the focus and you can really see that looking at it for the Neptune carrier is not one not two but three separate vehicles including a small buggy with claws on the front for scavenging loot which is stored in the front of the carrier and fastened to the back of it by a technic pin is a small scuba jet with harpoon guns clipped on top. As for display this one is ok, it does look much better paired with other sets(I&#39;ve got it with #8059 seabed scavenger and #8060 typhoon turbo).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: this is a marvellous set for play or display though some parts can fall of if held improperly</p>
