"Lost_Cosmonaut","2009-12-20T18:16:29.607Z","Very nice!","Was surprised to see this and a few other 2010 sets at my local store, and for 20% off no less!  So I snapped this one up and a few others.

This is a great little set, lots of detail and tons of playability.  The pullback motor is very cool, RC and the figures are spot on.  The rocket is the icing on the cake!  It's a little pricey for the piece count, but there's a lot of unique and new pieces here.

The best part?  NO STICKERS!  Let's hope LEGO keeps up on this new no sticker kick!  I'd gladly pay a couple cents extra per-piece to have no stickers like the old days!

Pros:
- Excellent detail
- Pull back motor
- Rocket!
- Super detailed Buzz and Woody figures!
- NO STICKERS!

Cons:
- A little pricey",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MasterOfPuzzles","2010-01-23T20:43:31.247Z","Just a bit disappointed","The RC model is really very nice, no stickers, solid and playable especially with the pull-back action.

The minifigs, however....

Woody, is beautiful and detailed unique minifig. However it came completely assembled and feels like the lower density, lower quality Chinese plastic used in many of the other pre-assembled minifigs. Buzz's body and legs feel like normal minifig quality, but the wings and helmet are very finicky to keep on, which reduces the playability of the set.

It would also have been nice if the rocket mounted to Buzz in a slightly more poseable way. As it is, the rocket spins far too easily.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bioniclemastermind","2010-01-26T15:27:42.89Z","Great Lego!","The pull back motor goes really fast! This is a great collectors toy. This set brings back memory's from the end of the 1st Toy Story. 
Pros:
There are no stickers only printed! It comes with buzz who only has half a helmet, woody has a hat that does not come off, and finally a brick built RC.

Cons:
There is no remote control panel in the lego set.
The figures are made of cheap plastic.
The 2 blue dishes on RC eyes should be bigger.

Other than that this a great set for fans of lego and the films toy story. Well worth the price. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"galonschiente","2010-01-10T14:29:29.577Z","'Beep Beep, toy coming through!'","I had to get this set off of ToysRUs.com because they ran out at the shop. And for £15.00, it was a great deal.

Once again, this will be split into sections, so lets get started-

Minifigures-

Woody- First things first this minifigure has amazing detail all around. We'll start with the head. Woody's hat is very nice. It is crooked with great colour. His face looks sweet and whenever I look at it, I feel safe. The hat doesn't come off which is a shame, but I don't mind, because that just makes him unique. His torso has a excellent cow-skin pattern with a shiny sherrif badge.
There are two buttons on his check jacket, and above that is a red neckerchief (I think). On the back he has more cow-skin and a pull string which really adds to the detail. Woody's legs have brown boots on them and a brown belt with a golden buckle. If you take off the legs, you could use the belt for a custom minifig. Woody has longer arms and legs than an average minifigure, so if you are thinking about swapping around minifig's pieces, you might want to swap the arms and legs so they don't look wierd! The legs could have had a bit of a denim-y look to them by adding a few light stripe patterns but apart from that.....
5/5 for this minifig!

Buzz Lightyear- LEGO really went to infinity and beyond with this minifigure! Once again, I'll start with the head. He has a purple head with small purple protrusions coming from the side of his head which might be ears. He has a small brown spiral on his chin, blue eyes, raised eybrows and a cheesy, toothy smile on his face. Buzz's armour has some small buttons and the star command insignia. This armour is helpful if you want to build a star command team. On the back thre is a stud to attach Buzz to the big one rocket (Which I'll get to in a minute), and the wings are purple with a red and white striped pattern. There is also a red light on the front of one of his wings while there is a white light on the other one. On the torso ther is yet again another star command sign and some print on the back that looks like a vent. The legs have green boots. It would have been great if there was a laser on one arm and a communication device on the other arm but LEGO can't do everything.
5/5 for this minifig!

The BIG ONE rocket- This rocket is truly wonderful. Small, yes, but wonderful. The red part at the bottom rocks and the writing is not a sticker but print! There is a technic piece inside holding the middle (which is actually an R2 unit body shape) and the part underneath together. A black spinner is used to clip Buzz onto the rocket. If it included a match it would get 6/5 but it doesn't so it's a.....
5/5 for the BIG ONE!

RC- The main part of the set. RC is spring loaded, so when you pull him/her/it back then release, he/her/it will go zooming ahead either until it hits something or stops, whichever comes first. The spoiler is a nice printed piece to own and the sides are printed also. The antenna is quite tall and the eyes are green frying pans held up by clips... Very cool! Young kids will find this very enjoyable to play with and if you are a collector like me, makes a great addition to any collection! One con, though. There is no remote control, when i'm pretty sure this scene had one in the movie.
4/5!

Altogether this set gets 19/20!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"thelegofan400","2010-02-05T21:20:47.89Z","To infinity and Beyond!","The motor is my new favorite brick! This is the fastest and most awesome motor in a lego set ever!
Pros
Awesome motor
NO STICKERS
could be a set for racer fans
Cons
Rocket needs to be more to scale, it is annoying on Buzz's back, he can't stand up!
The shell falls off, making it the motor and a few technic pieces.

"legofanatic2414","2010-03-01T14:05:51.403Z","Strapping onto RC Woody and Buzz zoom to Andy's Car before he leaves them!","<p>Woody and Buzz to the Rescue, this is a great set for the new Toy Story series as it has both of the main minifigures at a cheap price. Now, I am not saying this is the best set in the world, as every set has it's cons.</p>
<h4><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minifigures</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woody and Buzz are both very well made minifigures. Woody has a sculpted head with a hat (that does not come off ). He also is the first minifigure (along with Jessie) to have long arms and pants, the reason for LEGO to do this I am not sure (they have never took into consideration the tallness of some licenced minifigures, as Chewbacca was tall why didn't they give him one?). He is also printed on both sides with his pull string on the back. Buzz is a very interesting minifigure, as he has a step-by-step building process. he has a small sculpted head with his armor and wings (that are detachable for him to fit in certain places) and a visor that comes off easily. He also has the armor on big so any movement of his hand's are limited.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RC Car</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car I&nbsp;have the most complaints of. RC has a very nice body with&nbsp;good&nbsp;green pieces that do not need stickers! but his spoiler (I do not think that is the&nbsp;name) comes off very easily so it might limit playability justa&nbsp;tad bit. Now, it would have been nice to have a piece&nbsp;on the spoiler that&nbsp;Buzz could hold onto but that can easily be&nbsp;fixed. He comes with a built in motor and boy does it go FAST! I tried it&nbsp;and it goes a good 7 feet. The eyes do give a very nice sign of &quot;life&quot; to the&nbsp;car. The eyes come off easily though so keep that&nbsp;in mind.</p>
<h4>&nbsp; PROS:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Woody and Buzz&nbsp;come&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Very unique minifigures (Woody&nbsp;+ Long arms and legs =&nbsp;Custom Avatar!)</li>
    <li>RC is very fast</li>
    <li>The Rocket is very detailed</li>
</ul>
<p>NO STICKERS</p>
<h4>&nbsp; CONS:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Woody's hat is not detachable</li>
    <li>Buzz's visor comes off easily</li>
    <li>RC's spoiler comes off alon with his eyes</li>
    <li>With all these &quot;comes off'&quot;&nbsp;complaints you can conclude that this set is very fragile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p>&nbsp; Woody and buzz to the Rescue is a decent set for the Toy Story series. But, this set is very fragile so giving it to younger kids could be a problem AT TIMES. This is is a nice set and I would recommend it. 8/10</p>

<p>The set in general is a nice one, it has printed panels in lime green which are pretty cool.&nbsp; The printed parts I find are generally better than stickers, but in this case due to the somewhat special color/aspect of the parts I might have prefered to have them.</p>
<p>The build was pretty easy, there is a&nbsp;huge assembly that ratchets to propel the buggy so it takes away some parts to the build.&nbsp;</p>

"homer15","2010-02-24T00:06:00.75Z","witty toy story reference","i had a hard time finding this set.  i saw it once right after christmas, and my daughter freaked out.  i decided to get it for her the next day after work.  no luck.  everywhere was sold out.  seems like it's a popular set.

i just helped her build it and played with her for about an hour.  she loves it.  the fact that it held her attention for so long speaks volumes to me. 

pros:
- amazing detail.  both woody and buzz look like the real deal.  buzz even has a tiny head with a giant chin.  

- no stickers.  i always hated putting them on as a kid, and i know i wasn't alone.  with a set this detailed, stickers would've just ruined it.  

- a nice motor.  i can see lots of applications for this little motor.  it's fast, too.  

- even though he has custom body parts, woody's body can be interchanged with other lego body parts.  also, i've read people complaining that woody seems to be made of the cheaper plastic.  i'm not sure about that.  he seems just as sturdy as the other minifigs i've had.  it may be because his arms and legs are longer that they seem weaker.  his face and hat (and buzz's head, too) may be made of the cheaper stuff, but i'm not sure they'd be able to get the detail otherwise.  


cons:
- buzz's wing pack seems pretty loose.  his thin head popped off a few times already because it doesn't seem to hold the pack on.  

- the big one is way too big to really work for anything. i removed the two, blue round 2x2 pieces and put it back together.  it's a lot shorter and easier to keep on, but still big compared to buzz.  

- the spoiler on rc pops off too easily.  it's big and it rotates, and it's only held in place with two studs.  

- woody's hat doesn't come off.  nothing major.


all in all, i'd say it's a pretty awesome set.  it's fun, sleek looking, and has loads of details.  the characters (including rc) are easily recognizable to anyone who's seen the movie.  also, it actually moves!",FALSE,5,5,4,4,5

<p>A small problem, Buzz and the Big One are a little unstable and if you hit anything, both they and the back end of RC come off. A serious pain to reassemble but I guess legos do come apart. HAHA</p>

"tlmartin","2011-03-13T15:10:03.61Z","A nice fun kit, but needs more pieces for the buck","<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This kit costs &pound;15, however I got it for &pound;7.50 from Tesco using the Tesco double up vouchers (for any Lego fans that collect Tesco club card points, wait for Tesco to do the double up voucher redeems in store, because you can get any of the current kits for half price, you also get full club card points from them&hellip; and technically you actually get the kit for free because they are vouchers you got for normal shopping in Tesco. Be warned Tesco only stocks in store the kits under &pound;40)</p>
<p>Anyway back to the kit, yet again I am playing about with Stop Frame Animation (I have filmed this build, I just haven&rsquo;t processed it yet into a movie). The movie link will be added to this article soon if I don&rsquo;t have it done before positing this.</p>
<p>The kit contains 92 pieces, most of which are large only a couple of pieces are small. It has 1 special piece which is the motor, as when built if you pull the car backwards it will fire off at speed forward once you let go. There are also 2 mini-figs in this kit, a normal Buzz Lightyear with wings and helmet and Woody, a bit taller than a normal mini-fig, with his cowboy hat.</p>
<p>I was surprised to note that there was only 92 pieces in this kit as from looking on the box I would have expected more which is why I left this to be the third one I would build out of the Toy Story series.</p>
<p>This kit takes about 45 minutes to build with the process of taking pictures between each piece being put together.</p>
<p>The kit is ideal as a first starter kit for anyone entering the world of Lego. There is a small number of pieces, most are large, there are only a few small pieces in the entire kit, plus this kit actually does something with the motor unit.</p>
<p>Building this kit you get;</p>
<p>The Radio Controlled Car, with in built Motor Action, which allows you to pull back the car, release it and off it will fly. You start off building the main body of the car around this motor piece. It builds up quite nicely and quickly. The final part of the construction&nbsp; are the headlight/eyes, the wheels and the aerofoil (tilt-able).</p>
<p>There is also a small rocket built that attaches to Buzzs&rsquo; back, as per the scene in Toy Story,</p>
<p>Overall</p>
<p>Overall this is a very easy kit to build, but is also nicely detailed. All patterns are pre-painted on the kit so no stickers are required. After building it and seeing how many piece3s there are I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was worth &pound;15 it should be more like the &pound;10 kits you can get, but as I got it for &pound;7.50 of Tesco vouchers I can&rsquo;t complain. However it is certainly worth while having this kit if you are a fan of the Toy Story series of Lego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Additional</p>
<p>As I have mentioned I have been dealing with stop frame animation, however part of this kit can move on its own, so I have combined Stop Frame Animation and Video in an aims to show this kit off, hopefully you think it works well so please feel free to have a look.</p>

<p>With Toy Story 4 being now out in cinemas , I thought it would be fitting to review one of the old Toy Story sets : 7590 ! This set is the first of 2 sets depicting the iconic Toy Story character&nbsp;<a href=""https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/RC"">RC</a>&nbsp;and appears to be well designed for the time , 2009.</p>

<p><strong>The Packaging&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The packaging is fairly simple ; it features a blue sky background with cartoon clouds scattered around like Andy&rsquo;s bedroom walls. On the front of the box , 3/4 of it showcases the set with Woody and Buzz flying above RC. At the bottom there is a section showing how the pullback &lsquo;Motor Action&rsquo; works and to the right of that box is an image of Woody and Buzz. Above is the Lego and Toy Story logos and below those , is the set number and the suggested age for the set. To the top right of the box is the Disney logo. On the back of the box is yet again the Toy Story and Lego logo in the top left corner as-well as 4 different boxes showcasing ; the minifigures , the set and some of the play features.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Minifigures are usually the selling point for licensed sets and this set does have 2 excellent iconic minifigures&nbsp;, however the set doesn&rsquo;t disappoint either. Those minifigures are Buzz Lightyear and Woody : the 2 main characters of the Toy Story films. Woody features a specifically molded head piece featuring his accurate head shape . His head is molded&nbsp;to his hat , so is just 1 piece. Woody&rsquo;s torso features his checkered yellow shirt and a cow print jacket. His jacket has his sheriff badge and connected to his arms are longer arms than normal arms. On the back of his torso is the ring on the string connected to Woody&rsquo;s voice box. To match his longer arms Woody is equipped with brick high legs . These have printing on the front on the sides to represent boots . While this may not be the most effective technique now , I understand that 9 years ago dual molding wasn&rsquo;t a technique available to use. I quite like the specialised parts to create an accurate Woody however some may prefer the 2019 version&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/toy-story/products/woody-and-rc-10766"">featured in numerous sets.</a></p>

<p>While Woody has significantly changed since 2018 , not much has changed about Buzz Lightyear. Buzz features accurate leg and torso printing which might seem fairly basic compared to today standards , however was quite good back in 2010. Buzz features a backpack that is the correct shape to the film version and has 2 unique wing pieces that clip in. Buzz , like Woody features a specifically molded head , that is smaller than normal minifigure heads, to accurately capture Buzz&rsquo;s head. Buzz has a transparent visor which covers half of his head. It would be preferable if it covered all his head however this is a good compromise.&nbsp;To finish this minifigure off , he has a&nbsp;<a href=""https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/The_Big_One"">BIG ONE ROCKET</a>&nbsp;on his back which Buzz wears in the scene where Buzz and Woody chase to the removal van.</p>

<p><b>The Build</b></p>

<p>The build only uses 77 of the 92 pieces which is quite a small amount however accurately creates RC. RC features a blue bull bar , his eyes , his radio antenna and spoiler. No stickers are included so every detail that is there is printed which is excellent. All of these details are built around one big brick : a pull back motor. This motor is blue so doesn&rsquo;t ruin the entire build . On this brick is molded detail that would be expected to be seen in a remote control car as it looks like car parts. All 4&nbsp;of RC&rsquo;s wheels are connected by technic rods so once RC is pulled back he will be repelled forward.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Overall this set is excellent. The build is great while only having a small selection of&nbsp;pieces and accurately creates RC . All pieces that have detail on are printed so is a plus. The figures are excellent as well which makes this truly amazing . I would recommend this set to pretty much everyone , with Toy Story being a film nearly everyone has seen and this set features the films&rsquo; 2 main characters ! However while this set is excellent , it will be hard to get as it has been retired for years now. If you want an iconic Toy Story set then I would suggest getting <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10766-1/Woody-RC"">10766</a>&nbsp;however&nbsp;it&rsquo;s build is no where near as good as this one but still features Woody and is slightly cheaper!</p>
