Firstly for you anti-sticker guys and gals out there, good news: there is not a single sticker in this set. All the details are printed where needed. It's good to see some new parts in that lovely purple colour and the ""legs"" are actually made of 6 stud wide half-tube pieces rather than the 8-wide quarter-tubes I was expecting. The face is just a normal 4x4x2 cone brick with yellow teeth printed on it and the only really specialised components are the little ""hat"" with horns, the cloth cloak and the impressive looking ball-flinging cannon.

Once the model is assembled the cannon is a little tricky to load and younger children may need an all-too-willing adult to assist. The spring-loaded mechanism flings the hard plastic yellow balls a satisfying distance across the room to totally destroy all of Zurg's enemies, especially if you turn it all the way up to 11 ;) I'm joking of course, the dial on the cannon is for display only and does not increase it's effectiveness (boo!), except in your imagination. Note the model pictured above is assembled slightly differently to the instructions, as the dial can be seen from the front in my version.

Similar to Construct-a-Buzz, Zurg's arms do not bend at the elbow, and his back looks a little sparse and under-designed compared to the front (but who's going to be looking at his back?). Also Zurg's waist joint is somewhat loose, making him list slightly to his right when the weight of the cannon is added, but all these are minor quibbles and easily fixed with a little patience and a few bricks.

Simple and quick to build, very satisfying to look at (and play with) and just what you need to rule the Galaxy with an iron fist or lead your invincible armada in Universal Conquest, as you prefer. Top marks Lego!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2010-01-12T01:33:08.937Z","Not As Good As Buzz","Compared to Buzz Lightyear there isn’t much to this set, but it does look impressive when made up – which is why I bought it – to complement Buzz.

The simplistic one brick at a time at each step of the instruction booklet is repeated here, but as there are not that many pieces anyway, they could have saved a lot of paper. There are only a few pieces to make up the bottom cylinder and the cape is just a one large piece of cloth. The only section to really build is the torso/""waist"" and arms - the cannon is also really a one piece item. The head is a printed cone topped off with a custom part for the hat and horns. On the plus side the sphere shooting cannon does fire yellow balls and you get a couple of spares so you can reload without retrieving the original.
 
The thing that really intrigued me with Zurg the was the way they did the “waist” - it is 4 wheels with 4 tyres on them to give the impression of a corrugated flexible centre section – this is actually also correct for Buzz, and I think they should have used the same construction for the Buzz set.  Because it looks so much better, I swapped the “waists” over with just the help of just a few extra bricks to make Buzz more accurate, as he is definitely my preferred model, and I don’t think Zurg looks too bad with the smooth waist.

As there is not a lot to it, I did not expect to enjoy building this set as much as Buzz, but it does look good when finished standing 9 inches tall and very menacing with the sphere shooting cannon, which is good for play value. Again price is about right so I think it rates a 4.

"tlmartin","2010-08-22T19:12:09.543Z","A good set, not sure its worth £19.99","<p>Being a Lego fan and a Toy Story fan, and having the Tesco Vouchers (worth double value on toys) I couldn&rsquo;t resist buying this &pound;19.99 kit for &pound;10.</p>
<p>This is the Lego 7591 Toy Story Zurg kit. I have used it for my first attempt at Stop Frame Animation which is viewable on YouTube. This kit was ideal for this as it was a simple to build kit. This kit has a small number of pieces and most of them quite large. This would be ideal for any child to build, however there are a couple of very small studs which could be dangerous for really young children (well as dangerous as Lego could be).</p>
<p>This kit took me about 2 hours to build, but that was because I was moving bits, taking a pic, moving a little more, taking a pic, etc. I recon I could have built this within 30 mins.</p>
<p>Building this kit you get;<br />
Zurg &ndash; a 9&rdquo; tall creation. His arms are built fixed at the elbow (bent) however they are fully adjustable at the shoulders. His head and upper body can be turned fully. It also comes with a firm fabric cape. Zurg also has his gun with him, however it is only a single shot gun, rather than his triple shot. The kit does come with 3 yellow balls for shooting, which the gun will hold inside itself, so that you can continuously shoot 3 shots.<br />
1x Green Alien &ndash; You also get a Green Alien in this kit, with moveable head and arms, however the feet/legs are fixed and can not be moved (this did cause me problems with my Stop Frame Animation)</p>
<p>Overall<br />
This kit is great for those that love Lego and Toy Story, however I do not think it is worth &pound;19.99 for only 118 pieces and pieces that are generally quite large, so not much skill is needed.</p>

A really cool Zurg but not really not much good to play with because its a bit breakable, so I thing its made as a display model the same as Construct-a-Buzz, (7592), and&nbsp;thats what I do; And I don't think these two&nbsp;sets are worth £20.00 (UK price).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
