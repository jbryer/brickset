"starwarsgeek101_","2009-12-20T15:31:32.733Z","Very Cool","This set measures at about 8"", but it contains many cool features. Other than the alien which is very unique, this set contains a flick-fire missle, wings which can expand outward or be pulled back together, movable legs, movable arms, twistable waist, and the glass helmet which can be slid open or closed. Great set, I love how LEGO is doing this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"PaulC","2009-12-25T05:50:01.25Z","Two Infinity And Beyond!","This was a very nice present to find under the Christmas Tree this year! Words struggle to express just how cool the idea of a large scale Lego Buzz Lightyear is. I don't know quite why it's so cool, it just is! ;)

His arms lack elbow joints and his legs lack knees, but there are still plenty of excellent poses you can put Buzz in, and he doesn't lack in action features. His wings raise and lower, his space helmet opens, and he has the obligatory flick-fire missile on his laser arm. A light-brick would have been more faithful to the movie, but I can soon fix that. That's the beauty of Lego! I think he'll look particularly awesome together with Construct-a-Zurg http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7591-1 as a pair of bookends on my shelf.

After all the debate we've had about stickers it's nice to see quite a few printed parts in this set. Buzz's face, both forearms and the Space Ranger logo on his chest are all printed. Stickers are required for his name badge, the buttons on his chest and the red and white stripes on his wings.

Overall, top marks to Lego for an excellent set and top marks to Toys R Us for getting them in before Christmas.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2010-01-09T13:55:52.53Z","A Real Buzz","As soon as I saw Lego had released this modern film icon in the UK, I braved our worst winter weather for 30 years to go and get one – I also got the Army Men On Patrol set too as I thought both the men and the jeep looked great.
  
Construction comes in 2 main bags. First off you make the top part of the body including the waist, then add the only custom parts in this part of the set the head and helmet/visor which is in 2 parts to allow the visor to be raised. Bag 2 contains the parts to make the bottom half of the body and the legs and finally you add the wings.

Construction is fairly straightforward, and in this respect the instruction booklet is very simple showing almost one extra brick only added at each stage.  Judging from the reviews posted already, I don’t think I will be the only “big kid” buying this set, and I would have preferred it a little less simple as constantly turning pages after just 4 bricks had been added was a little tedious.

Despite the constant page turning I enjoyed the build which is straightforward, using mostly familiar elements, although I have personally never seen 1 x 3 tiles before - used on the tops of the legs (thighs?) here.  I have often wanted this element, so can we have it in more colours please?  We also get a “flick missile” in see-thru red to represent a laser – it is easily removed if you don’t want it as on “real Buzz” this is a light lower down nearer the hand. For now mine remains in situ. The alien Minifig is great by the way; my wife said it reminded her of me!

Whilst the set is very good, it could have been made even better if the elbows and knees had working joints too. I would also have liked it better if all the bricks were printed rather than a mix of printed for some elements (great) and then stickers for the “Lightyear” name and buttons on the chest and the warning chevrons on the wings. For once I am satisfied with the price of the set - at £20 I thought it was OK. 

Buzz actually stands 7 inches tall rather than 8 as stated below, but this makes him all the easier to display in my den which is pretty cluttered with lots of other models some Lego some not – he looks great, and is appropriately standing next to my “Rocket Garden” containing Apollo Saturn V and 1b as well as a couple of Space Shuttles and the Lego Delta from set 7469. I have a Disney Buzz, but he is still in the box as I have no room to display him.

My criticisms of this set are only minor ones, so I award it a maximum score.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"simplyoooo","2010-01-01T18:25:09.653Z","Niiiiice","To be honest, I really only bought this set for the little alien figure BUT I'm glad I took the time to build Buzz!  Apart from looking like he's wearing a corset because of his very small waist, this figure pretty much resembles how I remember the film.

A nice selection of printed parts, although I would have preferred the wing stripes to have been printed instead of stickers.

The construction is pretty solid, my only gripe with the set being that the legs assembly seem to detatch from the torso/chest assembly a little to easily meaning it would not stand up to much heavy play without having to be put back together again (but that is one of the joys of Lego!

I am tempted to take this into the office and have him on my desk, but I fear that it would be 're-located' in very short order.

Another reviewer mentioned that the chest juts out a bit too far, I would agree but I think this is more to do with counterbalance than poor design.  Same with the legs being a bit too wide spaced (reminded me of one of the robots in the Robocop 2 film!).

Overall a great set with some nice touches.  Instantly recognisable!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KJM72","2009-12-27T00:40:33.45Z","Brings Back Memories","I found this set under the Christmas tree yesterday. I think it's very nice in real life.

The folding visor should be a fascinating piece to use in MOCing. It actually comes in two parts, and one snaps into the other. I think that the visor is the coolest new part in the set.

Another great part of the set is the Alien minifig. It has short legs, which have always been annoying given the fact that you can't move them, but complement the appearance nicely. The new head is spot-on, in my opinion.

The torso design is nice by itself, even without the limbs attached. The chest juts out quite a bit, in my opinion a little too much. Otherwise, the appearance is very accurate. There are a few stickers on the chest: the ""Lightyear"" one, the three small buttons, and the red button. I was pleased to see that the Star Command insignia in the middle of the chest was printed, not sticker.

The arms are okay, except they lack arm articulation. The only natural poses you can achieve with this design involve hands on hips, or aiming the flick-fire arm missle/laser. There are two more printed pieces in the arm construction: the ""laser button"" piece on the right arm and the Space Ranger insignia on the left arm. The legs are a little more solid, but these lack knee articulation. They do, however include ankle articulation.

The backpack is fine. The wings (!purple!) are well proportioned, and can fold. the red and white stripes are stickers.

Pros:
-Torso build
-Visor
-Folding wings
-LOTS of purple
-Alien Minifig
-Printed pieces
-""Clicky"" Joints on the hips

Cons:
-No Elbow or Knee Articulation
-Limited poses can be achieved with arms
-Chest juts out quite a bit

Overall, I would recommend this set to anyone. It looks great on my desk right now, and it really brings back memories of these movies.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Duq","2011-06-25T21:52:36.483Z","He ain't perfect, but he's a must-have","<p>Finally picked up Buzz today, when I found him discounted at Argos. He's now standing proudly on my bookshelf where he's likely to stay.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>A reasonably sized box, with a picture of Buzz from a very strategic angle... Inside are two numbered bags, an instruction booklet and a sheet with 5 stickers.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Buzz is made off an interesting bunch of parts. Obviously there's a lot of white and lime green, especially plates and slopes. There are also some black macaronis and a few dark purple plates. And of course a Buzz head and a nice clear round half-dome which would make a great windscreen. White Bionicle fists are the perfect size</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>For some reason there's a three-eyed alien in this set.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The legs, the wings, part of the torso... there's a fair bit of SNOT building going on. The instructions are good but for young builders this could be challenging. The result is worth it though. There are a few printed parts and a few stickers. That may seem strange but the stickered parts have rarely (the 1x6 tiles) or never (the curved and sloped parts) been printed.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When built there's no mistaking: this is Buzz Lightyear from Star Command. The legs are chunkier than they appear on the box picture, thanks to that clever camera angle. Compare him to a movie still and you'll find a number of inaccuracies but that's not the point; he just looks the part.</p><p>Playability is ok; the wings fold (rather than slide), the arms and legs move (shoulders and wrists, hips and ankles, no elbows and knees) and he's swooshable.&nbsp;</p><p>When the owner grows up this Buzz makes a nice static model on a book shelf; no need to ship him to the salvation army like Andy does in the movie.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Fun to build, fun to play, and good looking on a shelf. And if you do decide to take him apart you're left with a nice bunch of parts. The only problem is the original price of €23.</p><p>Whether you've seen Toy Story as a child or with your child, go and get yourself a Buzz!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,3
"knuclear200x","2010-06-19T03:28:24.733Z","To Infinity and Beyond...Out of 5","I'm picky when it comes to action figures. All I want is good sculpting, multiple articulation, at least around 6 inches, and of quality material. For a Buzz Lightyear action figure, all of them at least fulfilled two of that criteria. Every figure I've bought has either been only half-good or disappointing, and only the really awesome ones were the expensive electronic, 12 inch models. When I heard that Lego has taken hold of the Toy Story license, I was ecstatic. Then I changed my pants after I saw the picture of the upcoming Construct A Buzz set. <br><br>The final product is...pretty accurate. He's got his slide-up helmet, an original head, fold-up wings in the back, and can do his heroic poses, but he can only do two of them. Namely his side-arms hero stance and his flying pose. He also has swivel hips, which make his initial poses slightly better. Other interesting pieces of note are some pre-labeled bricks, the new Bionicle hands, Ball/socket 
bricks and the ratchet joints. But he only gets a few joints as he can't stretch his arms, bend his knees or even do as much as his 
laser-point pose. And for the MSRP of $25, it's almost a rip-off. Also there are stickers, I hate stickers. Personally, I preferred to wait for an opportunity for Target, TRU or Walmart to slash at least $5 off to make it really worth it or at least have some BOGO sale of sorts. And they did. For me to pay full MSRP, they would need to throw in knees or elbows.<br><br>Overall, Lego kind of fails for the lack of additional joints, but redeems itself at just making a set for the Buzz Lightyear character. Personally, I also think that this beats every other Buzz Lightyear action figure ever made (at least until I see how well Revoltech's Buzz Lightyear stacks up). Even the ones with all that sound, signature features from the movie, and those buttons, they just can't top its full Lego brand customizeability. But only those with A LOT of Exo Force or Bionicle pieces to spare (or sets with similar pieces) would only be able to see, and possibly agree with, what I'm talking about. <br><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"Lint","2010-12-19T23:58:16.353Z","Surprisingly awesome!","I wasn't charmed by the full retail price of this set but finally got him after many clearance markdowns.

"MetroiD","2010-06-13T20:52:14.217Z","Surprisingly good!","Toy Story was never my pick for Theme of the Year, but I must admit that the quality of the sets produced for Buzz &amp; Woody's adventures actually goes a long way to justifying LEGO's pricing policy on licensed themes. Most of the Toy Story sets look like real good value for money, but none more than the 7592.<br><br>Put simply, what you get here is much more than what you see. The sheer amount of lime and purple pieces contained herein makes the whole set worthy - not to mention the alien minifig. Oh yeah, and Buzz himself. But we'll come to that.<br><br>In terms of building experience, this one is, admittedly, none too breathtaking. You might even say it's a bit repetitive, but the progress is still enjoyable and those nifty bits and pieces included make sure that you don't start yawning while building Buzz's 'second' leg or arm. As to the finished model itself - yes indeed, poor ol' Buzz has been Barbie-d up a bit (what a waistline!), but at the end of the day it's still most definitely him, albeit in a shiny sleek (instantly recognisable) new LEGO package. And I must say, after having owned figures of Buzz, Woody and the lot back in the days, building this set really did come as a nice trip down memory lane.<br><br>All in all, even though all that lime and purple is heading straight to the parts bin, I must confess that I sat there for a while and wondered why they hadn't thought of having Buzz made out of LEGO in the first place. Sure looks right to me!<br><br>Oh, and if you're not sold on the 'lime &amp; purple Buzziness' part, the alien minifig should still be enough of a reason to buy this one.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

This creates the main body and all of the join points of the creation. Next goes on the head which is attached in such a way that you can turn the head a full 360.
