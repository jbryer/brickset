the fact they included that little rover thing

CONS
no aliens:(
nothing for zurg to stand on or use like a turret
no stearing wheel for the little rover

quite good worth the $40:00 i payed for it
the set it's self is outstanding i highly recomend it 
i'm a little dissapointed that zurg didn't come with like some groud or a turret or some thing.The ship is quite small and light and the little rover thing fits in good.Buzz him self is quite neat with a good sculpt the little helmet peice dosn't stay in well at first so it may be a bit of a nucense ...any way it's a good set non the less and i'm happy iwht it (even if ther is no cute little aliens)   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"PluffTed","2009-12-27T22:12:55.06Z","Not As Well As I Thought!","I received this set on Christmas and was not really satisfied.  I got it at my local Toys R Us in San Diego, CA for $35 and was a big rip-off!  I really like the Zurg fig, but I was very, very disappointed with the Buzz fig!  If you're hyped up about buying this set with your Christmas money, then don't be.  Trust me, you WON'T be satisfied!

Pros:
-Zurg fig really cool!
-Spaceship is well-designed!
-Opening back hatch is nice!

Cons:
-Buzz fig really LAME!
-Vehicle that comes out of the 
back hatch is lame!
-Big rip-off!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"baylego","2009-12-28T11:06:49.03Z","Beyond Infinity"," I got this set for Christmas, and it is probably one of the best sets of 2010!

 The minifigs are fantastic! Buzz is 7 pieces, and is very cool. Zurg is just plain awesome! His cape is black on the back. I am still wondering why they put the scooter in the set, but it has lots of rare purple and lime green parts, which is always nice.

 As with the starship, I am still amazed that they fit so much room in it. the cockpit is very roomy, and fits Buzz perfectly wing tip to wing tip. The two sections in the back swing open. There is also a little platform that covers the back of the ship that you can wheel the buggy into. The back space could also be easily modded into a command center. It's wing span is about the length of the freeco speeder.

 The price tag of $29.99 is reasonable, and not overpriced. However, I would of liked to see one or two aliens included. Overall, this is a must buy and pick it up if you see it at MSRP! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"galonschiente","2010-01-10T17:04:35.717Z","'Star Command, come in Star Command, do you read me?'","Before I begin, let me just say, I highly recommend that you read my 'Woody and Buzz to the rescue' review, as it goes into much more detail about the Buzz Lightyear minifigure.

Alright, so I bought this set with some leftover christmas money, and, apart from the fixable cons that appear, this set is probably my favourite Toy Story set that I own so far and you should own too! If you're into interstellar spaceships, then this is the set for you!

Minifigures-

Buzz Lightyear- Like I said in my 'Woody and Buzz to the rescue' review, this minifigure is incredible! Enough said.
5/5!

'Evil emperor' Zurg- This minifig is just WOW! When I first saw this minifigure I was gobsmacked! He has so many cool pieces and most of them are purple! Purple is RARE! His head is pointy with two grey horns sticking out the top, his eyes are bright red and evil looking.His mouth is cyborg-looking and is a nice yellow colour. Zurg has a chest plate that has a lightning bolt on it and is good for customs. His torso has a couple of robot looking printing on it and is once again great for customs. He too, like Woody, has longer arms and even has a long skirt piece which really surprised me, because on the box he just looked like a regular minifig! Now, he wouldn't be Zurg without the cape, which comes in two parts and is red on one side and black on the other.like I said twice before, good for customs. Last but not least, I would count this as an accessory, but I just won't for some reason, is Zurg's flick fire missile, which really could have been improved A LOT. Instead of building something with yellow orbs as ammunition and wires and stuff, they made it out of THREE PIECES and the orb is RED! LEGO could have made it like the construct-a-Zurg gun and gave it extra ammo, as it only has ONE 'bullet'. Also Zurg doesn't have anywhere to stand. They could have added a small base plate or something! These cons can be fixed so don't worry.
Zurg- 5/5!
Flick fire missile- 3/5!

Moon buggy- I'm actually quite happy that this vehicle was included, as it adds to the playability of the set. There are rare purple and light green pieces to this little buggy and the headlights are nice and orange. A small canister of some sort is clipped onto the rear of the vehicle. This can be used in LEGO movies.
5/5 for the moon buggy!

The Star Command spaceship- I can't tell you how great this thing is, so i'll just move on to the cockpit. Once you flip open the cockpit, inside is an area for buzz to sit and there is a control panel at the very front, which probably activates the lasers, which'll be covered, don't panic! There is a small hole in which you can see the rear hatch, which also will be covered. The wings have a few stickers that are red and white stripes, just like Buzz's wings. The lasers are transparent and don't really fire, but are there for detail, but you can imagine that you are disintegrating Zurg. The wings snap on and off so you can also imagine that the ship is blowing up! The rear compartment opens out so that the moon buggy can go inside and get flown to different planets and scout about. I tested this out, and you can fit a minifig on the buggy while inside the compartment! It was really generous of LEGO to include the feature of opening the sides so you can see the full rear hatch from the inside! The engines are conical shaped with trans-orange studs for flames! Sinse the set comes with spares you can give them more flames!
5/5 for the spaceship!

Altogether this set gets a 23/25!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KJM72","2009-12-29T11:14:08.967Z","A LOT Cooler in Real Life","I received this set for Christmas a few days ago, and promptly built it. As I dumped out the pieces, I was amazed at the great amount of more 'rare' pieces were included in this set, in hard to find colors. There was a surprising amount of purple. Those were just my first impressions of 'the dump.' I still have yet to mention the minifigs and ship itself!

The minifigs were packaged a little weird. If you're buying this for a young child, I suggest you open the little bags that have the minifig parts with scissors. Buzz's bag is especially hard to open and very small pieces are inside. The Buzz minifig is pretty nice, I just wish the visor flipped down. Zurg is a great minifig, in my opinion. The cape is very nice, and it comes in two parts: the collar, and the cape itself. One side is red, the other is black.

The ship is a great build. The cockpit is great, it's really quite big. Buzz fits perfectly inside, with his wings on. One of the best parts of the ship is the function in the back. The two parts can open up, and the back can fold down, so the buggy can go in and wheel out. Once closed, the back stays closed snugly. It won't open unless you want it to.

I think this set is immaculate. It could've had an alien, but I think it's fine without  another minifig.

Pros
-Great minifigs
-Large cockpit
-Function in back of ship doesn't spoil the aesthetic look
-Lots of great pieces

Cons
-Buzz's visor doesn't fold open and closed",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"kaboomlegoman","2010-03-28T13:51:06.607Z","An okay set.","<p>This is an okay set.</p>
<p>Minifigures: 9/10. The minifigs are amazing. The only reason I rated this a nine is because Buzz's helmet can only be open and not closed. Oh, well, Zurg is an awesome figure. He's really detailed, but the gun thing is weird and insignificant.</p>
<p>Building: 6/10. The build is fun in some parts, but others aren't really thrilling.</p>
<div>Pieces: 5/10. None of the pieces are new except the trans-pink things on the blasters. Actually, those are just rare.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Design: 8/10. The back lets the buggy thing fit comfortably with a smart use of tiles and bars, and the cockpit is almost completely closed.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Playabilty: 9/10. The wacky possibilities are endless. Zurg gets burned up in the thrusters at take-off, Buzz sings at a concert, and Zurg faints, classic play. :)</div>
<div><br />
Price: 7/10. Pretty much standard, and nice considering what you're getting.</div>

<div>Overall: 44/60. A nice set granted, with some flaws, but okay otherwise.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

I got this set from my Aunt on my Birthday.<br><br>The Figures<br><br>Buzz is very detailed. It has his wings, his visor (does not open or close, just stays like that), he has those buttons on his armor. Underneath his armorshield thing is a logo of star command, pretty cool. His head is also detailed. Zurg is also pretty cool. He has a nice flick fire gun, and attire. He has not one, but TWO add on cape things. His head is very cool.&nbsp; Rating:10/10<br><br>The little rover<br><br>The rover isn't very exciting. It is a small vehicle with lights, a small (did i say small, i mean ridiculously tiny) seat for Buzz to sit on. It is holding some sort of pod containing a liquid or gas or something of that sort. 9/10<br><br>The ship <br><br>The ship is utterly awesome. The cockpit is small, with a controls brick (no sticker). The back compartment can be opened to find a fairly large spot to put your rover or make a little command roon. The engines have red studs on the back to signify the burners. The wings have nice decor on it and i especially love the long neon green sticks. <br>Rating:10/10<br><br><br>I highly recommend this set to anyone. See ya! ",TRUE,5,4,4,5,3
