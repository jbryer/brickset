I was a little disapointed that the hats dont come off, and i dont like that the minifigs are so tall with distorted heads. It comes with a mine, with a crystal, and a safe in the sheriff building.

pros: 4 rare minifigs, 3 dynamites,gold,3 100 dollar bills, bullseyes legs move, and printed legs

cons: stickers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
4 great minifigures!  (3 of them u can only get in this set)
3 dynamites
2 handcuffs!
Cactus
Gold mine (has gold crystal and has 3 rocks to drop on stinky pete)
Snake 
Safe- has 3 $100 bills in it
Top part of the sheriffs office comes off
The jail (when u turn the nob on the side the back of the jail comes off
New light blue windows
Worth the price

Cons:
Stickers! I hate stickers 6 in all, the sheriff sign is really 2 stickers
The inside of the bottom half of the sheriffs office is boring the only thing in it is a small 4 legged-table.
The thing in between the 2 buildins is supposed to launch a minifigure but is not well designed and dosent work well

All in all if you like the toy story theme this should be on the top of your list of sets to get.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Duq","2011-08-26T17:45:49Z","Nice playset with lots of useful parts","<p>I finally bought this set when it went on sale and I'm glad I did. It's a better set than I had expected.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are 2 maxifigures in this set; Woody and Jessie. They have the extra long legs and arms, and heads with hats in one piece. I would have preferred them as normal minifigs like all other licensed sets but I guess Pixar demanded this.</p><p>There's also a Stinky Pete who has fixed short legs and also has a head and hat in one piece. He only appears in this set while the other three are also in the Toy Story train set.</p><p>Finally there's Bullseye, the horse. It's legs move (in pairs) but its neck is fixed.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>There are three sections to build; the gold mine, the sheriffs office and the jail.</p><p>The mine sits on its own and it easy to build with a large panel and two big rock pieces. The sheriffs office and jail are built separately but are then connected using technic pins in the same way as the modular buildings. The set is obviously aimed at a low age group so there are no difficult building techniques used. Apart from those technic pins and a few tiles stuck to bricks with studs on the side it's all just stacking bricks and plates.</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">The completed model</span></p><p></p><p>The mine is tiny; you only really get the entrance but that entrance is done really well; with&nbsp;crooked beams and an old lamp it just looks right.&nbsp;There's an opening in the roof to drop round 1x1 pieces through to make it look like the mine is collapsing. With the mine you also get Pete's tool crate with dynamite, a pick-axe, a shovel and a broom.</p><p>The sheriffs office is very small and doesn't really look like an office. The doors are more of a saloon type and there's no interior to suggest it's an office. Having said that, it's a nice looking building and the safe upstairs is a nice touch as well.</p><div>Next to the office is the jail. This could easily have been done with large panels but instead it's brick built in light and dark grey with some grille bricks for texture. A section of the back wall can be blown out with a little lever on the side of the building.</div><div>The office and jail are connected with technic pins. The pins sit in red technic bricks. Where the two buildings are connected they're invisible but for some reaon the outside of both buildings also has the technic bricks and there they are in full view. They could easily have been replaced with 1x4's in dark grey or brown.</div><div>Between the buildings is a board that according to the instructions can be used to send Pete flying. I don't remember that bit from the movie but the important thing is that it doesn't work; Petes hat catches the ledge on the office every time.</div><div>There's a trough with water (transparent blue round plates) and a little cactus for decoration.</div><p></p>
<h4 style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial; "">Parts</h4><p>The only parts unique to this set (apart from Pete) are the windows in medium blue. While the other parts may not be special there's a nice selection. There are lots of brown and light grey bricks and tan plates, tiles in dark brown, brown cheese slopes and light grey double cheese slopes, grill bricks and various slopes in dark grey.</p><p>There are a few stickers for the signs; JAIL, SHE RIFF, Gold Mine and the 'Wanted' poster. The strange thing is that all the stickers have a reddish brown background colour but are applied on dark brown tiles. The one sticker that does have a dark brown background goes on a grey tile...</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Time to award the points then. Only 3 out of 5 for the building experience; it's pretty straightforward but then it's aimed at 6 year olds. Full marks for parts. There really is a nice selection in this set. Playability gets 4 out of 5; plenty of elements and items to play with but the trick with the collapsing mine isn't great and sending Pete flying doesn't work at all. Value for money gets 4 out of 5. Licensed sets will never match City or Creator when it comes to bricks for your buck but even at full retail price this set is pretty good with nearly 500 pieces for 45 euro.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"water_jedi_17","2010-04-06T17:53:03.28Z","A nice set, but needing some work","I recently recieved this set as a gift and the set is a somewhat good and bad set. Read on to find out why:<br/>&nbsp;Minifigs: 3 minifigs are included: Sheriff Woody, Jessie, and Stinky Pete. Woody and Pete have a pullback string plus some back printing which is always good. Jessie has a ponytail and no back printing. The hats are non removable and made of inferior plastic. The long arms and legs are a plus when it comes to accuracy although being poor quality, I can't say they are the best. Bullseye is one piece and comes with two pieces to put in his saddle when he isn't being ridden by Woody. To remove it, you simply stick a broom up his.um..saddle.<br/>&nbsp;Playability: This set comes with some juniorized play featire (ages 5-12 recommended) The mine has an easy function where you drop 1X1 tube pieces into the shaft to make it seem like its collapsing. The main buildings come with a catapult to launch stinky pete, but it seem more like an afterthought since its really bad(think of 7749's clone catapult)Finally, the back of the jail can 'blow up' by spinning a lever on the side to make the wall come down. Of course, Pete can just walk out the unlocked door...<br/>&nbsp;Building experience: It is a fun build, as you can see how the building come up and isn't boring. The parts come in numbered bags to make it easier to build<br/>&nbsp;Parts: There's a nice parts selection for western MOCs including lots of brown. No color inconsistencies unlike some other sets. There are some new 2X4 panels which i think are exclusive or rare. Dynamite and some mining equipment are also included. Finally, some sky blue window pieces are included.<br/>&nbsp;Design. The mine isn't the best lego has done with only one gold piece and the back makes it seem more like a wall. Also included are 1x2 cheese slopesand SNOT is used to create the entrance :-) The first floor of the main building is quite dull with only a 2x3 table. I was hoping for a bar, or at least an office. The top is also bare with a safe. The safe is nice though.The jail is also quite barren. Sigh, these buildings need some work.<br/>&nbsp;Not the best set, but its still nice in your collection.&nbsp; ",TRUE,1,4,4,3,4
"kaboomlegoman","2010-02-15T00:07:37.45Z","Good set.","I like this set because the buildings are really cool.


Minifigures: Really good minifigures. Jessie and Pete are exclusive, and Woody is really cool. As for Bullseye, he's also eclusive and cool.


Pieces: Really great pieces. We have the new 1x3 tiles in brown for the ""She"" ""Riff"" sticker sign ( It's split in two parts. LOL) and some rare sky blue windows.


Playability: Good. Really great. Stinky Pete escapes, steals money, Jessie and Woody pursue him, back in jail. A classic cops and robbers game.


Price: Good price. 506 pieces for a $50 dollar set. Standard.


Overall: Really good. I like the overall design of it, but the plates are like earthquakes. Sometimes when carried, they move against each other, and fall apart. But overall great set.",FALSE,4,4,5,5,4
