 The minifigures are the best part! The helmets are great. The accessories are as follows: 2 binoculars, 2 rifles, 2 walkie-talkies, 1 metal detector, 1 suitcase and a stretcher. The bases look like lilly-pads.

 The jeep is very cool. There is an extra wheel attached to the back of the jeep.
It's very similar to the Indy Brickmaster jeep.

the ste is awsome great for amry building or making a lego militayr or for peices.I bought this set at toys r us for $14:99 wich was weird cause i thought it would've been $12:99 but it don't matter. a small set but great if ya get two cause then you can have the mdics carrying a randmo troop on a stretcher.i'm kinda mad that they didn't include a green revolver cuase then you'de be able to have the seargent with his trademark pistol.basically it's a great set totally worth the money and not a bad army builder.

This is a GREAT set.  The little jeep is perfect, but definitely the figures are the best part.  Lots of new pieces.

There's also a stretcher.  TONS of playability, the jeep is a quick build and looks good.  All in all this is a definite 5/5!

Pros:

Cons:
- Should have used clear pieces for the windshield, but this is a VERY minor con.

I thought the jeep looked good even if it does only accommodate one person - we should remember the models in this series are supposed to be representing “toys” from the movies rather than the real thing. The soldiers are great representing all those toy soldiers I had as a child - I know they are still in my attic somewhere.
 
There are plenty of guns, radios, binoculars and even a stretcher allowing you to pose them a number of different ways. I like the medic with his white cross on his helmet, back pack and little case. The bases can be used with other Minifigs as they can appear as grass and will help them to stand up. Lots of mine fall over constantly if I knock the shelf they are displayed on – bases would stop this, perhaps Lego should consider using them in more sets. 

I thought this was a great fun set – it makes me smile when I look at it and the rest of the Toy Story Minifigs i have. Price could have been a couple of pounds less so I’ve knocked a point off for that.

PROS
Army Men minifigs are awesome. Especially the helmets and stands.
Lots of accessories
Jeep is a solid build.
Stretcher!
Green colour is great!

CONS
Duplicates/spares of the radio and binoculars. A spare rifle would have been more appreciated.
Jeep is a one seater (you can't expect too much these days)
Jeep has no facility to store any of the accessories. A couple of clamps to hold a radio and a rifle would have been very nice.
Price. It's gone up 10% compared to last years 'battle packs' and I don't think you can blame all that on licensing fees for that can you?

"wildwill","2010-01-12T17:43:59.797Z","Smaller sets = more play value","Lego has really got a big hit on their hands with their ""battle pack"" sets.  One doesn't think ""Battle Pack"" and ""Toy Story"" in the same sentence, but this pack is the one that makes a TON of sense.  I hope they do another pack with a Crane and a bunch of little green 3 eyed men.  I also hope they do another pack of soldiers with a different little vehicle.  Hey perhaps they could even do a tan set too.

What to say that hasn't been said already...

Some have been disparaging the jeep and saying that it's too small, I think it's perfect size, you CAN put two figures on it, one sits on the back.  I think the spare tire is genius too.  I don't even mind the opaque windshield as it evokes the actual cheap army men toys it's based upon.

To reiterate the good points:

4x Green Soldiers.  
2x Bincos
2x Walkies
2x Rifles (YEAH!)
1x Briefcase - YEAH
1x Mine Detector
1x Backpack
1x Stretcher

"Niallskie","2010-01-07T07:32:01.967Z","LET'S GO GREEN","  I had no plan on collecting the Toys Story Lego theme at all, but when I ran into this set at our local Target I just could not resist to buy them. Not to mention it's price being right for $10.99. When I build these soldiers, it was pure fun as I used to buy them green plastic soldiers when I was a small boy. At first I just bough one set, but was so amazed by it that I quickly ran back to grab me a couple more. Too bad these were sold out really quick. I did try to look for them on other stores but nada. I was even disappointed that the Lego Store doesn't even have them yet. I never even tried TRU coz they usually jack thing up pretty high. So on to the review.

  As always on a battle pack you usually get 4 minifigures (dont know if it's called battle pack for Toy Story theme). You get basically the same minifigure 4 times over, but I'm sure you will love it non the less. Everybody have the same everybody except for one helmet that has a white dot and a cross inside of it which symbolizes a medic. The stan are awesome, makes them look like the real plastic soldiers. Oh and this platoon si packed with armaments and what not. We have 2 binaculars, 2 riffles, 2 walkies, a mine detector, a brief case, a back pack and a streatcher. Now we move on to the jeep, yes with all the stuff that I already told you we still have a jeep in there. The jeep is awesome just to look at, its amazing how they manage to conceptualize something like this with such a small amount of bricks. Addition of black element on the jeep is a great addition but I think if they made it plain green is alright as well. The jeep is a one sitter though but still cool on its own. I guess everything in this set is practically awesome for me. I do not see any cons on this set only pros. So buying this set is a definite yes, specially if you want to build an army. I am glad I got a couple sets more at a good price. So don't hesitate and grab this set when ever you can.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros
-4 soldiers (you get 2 normal guys a medic and sarge)
-almost 2 of everything(2 rifles , 2 radios , 2 binoculirs 1 medkit and a back pack and i mine thing erm Idk)
-cool helmats (3 nromal 1 with the medic sign on it)
-a bed thing

-the bed sucks because there is no where to put it,it looked like it goes on the back BUT on the bottom (of the bed) there is there 2 things that stop it from fitting on
-the back pack Dont look like a army One if you want it to look like one cut the round thing on top that goes behide hi shead it looks WAY better and you can usee more hats
-and the jeep only fits 1 man and one on the back you can put 3 men on but the back goes weird

For anyone over the age of.. well about 30, fond of any of the above, this is the set to get. Anyone else?.. well.. lego and army men figures!!<br />

Funnily, what makes the set perfect are the stands. Without them you've just got some green minifigs.

The build.. Easy.<br />
Capturing the feel. Absolutely. Normal minifigs have character, these minifigs have some sort of character ultra-combo!<br />
Colours. Green.. more green, and the odd bit of (hidden) grey.<br />

Problems.. Well. There's no tan or grey version to fight against..<br />

The minifigs, rare accessories, dozens of green parts; this set really has you covered. Its main downside is playability, though. With an absence of a tan Army Men set (which probably won't be made- this set probably slipped by Lego's strict ""no-military"" policy because it's a set based on another toy), this set doesn't have the playability factor of a set that includes multiple factions.

<p><b>Instructions:</b>&nbsp; Very well layed out, nothing too much to be said here.&nbsp; It is a full sized instruction book, typical of many $10-30 sets.&nbsp; The building&nbsp;was made very easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Minifigs:&nbsp; </b>Probably one of the main attractions of this set, the minifigs are quite good.&nbsp; All in green, ( some time in the future they will become&nbsp;aliens,) they seem rare.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; if you look at their faces, it seems that the paint is somehow lighter then it should be.&nbsp; The accessories included are two rifles, two pairs of binoculars, a back pack, two radios, a metal detector, and four all-new helmets, all in green.&nbsp; Also there is a stretcher for the wounded plastic men.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Jeep:</b>&nbsp; The jeep is a nice design, though quite simple.&nbsp; There is room from one minifig, unless you have one riding on the back.&nbsp; Everything is green and black.&nbsp; One thing&nbsp;I think is odd, though it is in no way a complaint, is that the hood of the jeep is made up of two&nbsp;2&nbsp;x&nbsp;2 smooth plates.&nbsp; With the introduction to the&nbsp;2 x&nbsp;4 plate this&nbsp;year, you would have thought that&nbsp;Lego would have cut costs, and just slapped on a 2 x4 instead.&nbsp; I am very happy about the extra wheel and tire on the back; nice detail.</p>

<p>The set includes four army figures with boards to stand on replicating the army men in the toy story movies. the army men come with a selection of weapons and acceseries to hold and use. These include a green strecher,walkie talkie and gun. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set also includes a small&nbsp; green car which is a bit like a smaller version of one of the race for the stolen treasure cars. Although it never appeared in the films the car makes the set a nice addition and add's something good to the set. it certainly makes the makes the set quite more durable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For £10.00 the set although not big seems to have quite a lot and is quite good value. The build takes no longer than 5 minutes and is small but quite durable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recomend this set to&nbsp; everyone. Even if you dont like&nbsp; toy story.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Good easy build my 5 year old was able to complete with minor help from me (wheel &amp; tire assembly).&nbsp; </p>
<p>2. I liked the Jeep when finished and my boy was immediatly off and playing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>3. GREEN ARMY LEGO MEN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Con:&nbsp;They are pretty much the same size as LEGO Woody and Buzz &amp; Jessie, so the sizing seems wrong for play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So good, we got another set a week later!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Tupperfan","2015-10-30T17:34:25.02Z","Not real Green Army Men!","<p>BUYERS BEWARE: These are NOT green army men. These are LEGO minifigures copying the beloved plastic toys of our childhood.</p>

<p>It is, however, a good starting pack to build a green-bodied army to pit against Barbie, Mr.Potato and their wicked gang. With that goal in mind, and the high attrition rate of such campaigns, it might be cheaper to buy generic plastic green army men, though.</p>

<p>I HIGHLY recommend buying 200 copies of this set, in order to achieve a battalion-level combat unit (with lots of medics!).</p>

Pieces are pretty rare &amp; cool, but then again, not much playilability by itself. It's pretty good for those who were always going like ""I want army sets!"" but doesn't really match with real life combat (Not that they were aiming for that). The minifigures are epic. I love their stands and their detail. The bed-thing is awesome. Great for a MOC, if it was another color, of course. The army men are lacking a captain, and their&nbsp;jeep is just a tad small. Not really good if you don't have any other Toy Story sets, kinda drives you away from toy story sets. Onto the pros and cons!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-15T10:31:23.593Z","In the Army","<p>Set #7595 Army Men on Patrol: Months passed by, every day I saw this set, every day I was tempted, but the price continued to deter me due to budget concerns. And then, in December, near the last few days before Christmas, Wal-Mart goes and drops this down to 10$, then drops it again at 50% off, for 6.97$ each I quickly snatched up two and would have gotten three or four, but I ran out of money and the sale ended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Army Men on Patrol is one of the absolute PERFECT sets that LEGO has ever created for any of their licensed Themes. It has to be the single best one out of all the Battle Pack style sets that they have ever made, why? Because it's Green Army Men, with a Green Jeep, with Green Accessories! That's why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Jeep: A charming little vehicle that can fit in anywhere, it doesn't have to stay with Toy Story alone, not in the world of LEGO. The build is staisfying and simple, it doesn't use too many parts, but they are all in green. Every last one of them, with exception to a few black pieces used to add a dash of color there, since if it was entirely in green it would admittedly be a bit bland looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Accessories: Two green walkie talkies, two green rifles, two pairs of green binoculars, a green backpack, a green suitcase (Which I see by the new LEGO City Bank set LEGO is using to more great effect this year.) and the green stretcher. (I haven't had a LEGO stretcher since Victory Lap Raceway in the late 1980's, now I've got two of them and they're green.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures: Complete with LEGO Green Stands, all four of them are completely green from head to toe, with green faces, green hands, green legs, green torsos and green army hats. They look great on or off the stands, but I think on makes a little bit more sense even when put next to other Mini-Figures they should be on their stands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look at this set and I have to smile, many have stated fond memories of the little green army men they had as a youth, I have a different memory. Despite the all green Mini-Figures I am reminded of MASH the television series and spending time with my grandmother watching the show while mom and dad were working and I was getting babysat. The little jeep really reminds me of the show as does that stretcher. I think I'll call my first Doctor Hawkeye and my second Doctor Trapper, and one of the other guys can be Radar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that if you don't already have this set, get it, it has terrific green elements, a simple build, some of the greatest Mini-Figures LEGO has ever made available and it can stand to represent anything you want in your LEGO universe. Who cares if they have green heads and hands, they are still great Mini-Figures and shouldn't be criticised just because they look a little different next to normal Mini-Figures. If you have only one of this set, find a store discounting it and buy another one, everyone should have two or more of this set to show LEGO that ideas like this are what it's all about. They could give us a million and one Clones or Stormtroopers or what have you, but when they slip something like this into a Theme that is both fun and unique, I just have to compliment them on a job well done.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
