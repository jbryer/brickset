The buttons on the snowman are pretty cool on both sides of the snowman. It would have been nice if LEGO had covered the hole in the hat, but thats OK. The stand is a nice addition and a  good idea, making it possible for the snowman to stand up.

This is a cool little set for 5.00$(US)and i bought about three of them",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
