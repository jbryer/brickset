"trewerd","2009-11-25T22:09:44.077Z","Smaller Mask; Bigger Sword","The Toa Mata of Fire is back... sort of. With little over half of the pieces the original Tahu had, this ""scaled down"" version still manages to more poseable.

The Look: Using different pieces, it pulls off the ""Tahu Look"" quite well.

The Mask: The same mask as before, but smaller and designed to fit on an Av-Matoran head, as well as Metru heads.

The Weapon: The flame sword found on Glatorian Legends Ackar, but with a bit more paint blended in, so it looks like fire. MUCH wider than the original Tahu sword, but about an inch longer.

Pros: 
-MORE POSEABLE THAN THE ORIGINAL
-Able to fit into canister without the need to remove weapons and armor
-Mask doesn't fall off easily.
-Includes Golden version of the mask
-Cooler looking weapon (more of an opinion really)

Cons: 
-About the same price as the original was back in 2001, but containing 
a lot less pieces.
-Small mask cannot fit a Toa Mata head.
-Arms are solid, pre-bent pieces, making it look awkward.
-Av-Matoran head (see through, making the whole face show light, rather than the mata heads in which light only shows in the eyes.

All things considered, it's a nice little representation of the character. Not a bad toy, but for 5 dollars more, you could get the larger Glatorian sets which feature more poseablility, and all in all, more pieces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

How ironic that the first toa I ever got would also end up being the last. For an $8 set, the size isn't bad. The flame sword is awesome and looks ten times better than the origanal. I really like the mix of red and orange because of the new red plates added on to the arms. Although the red fists are nice, I think it would have been cool to take the origanal ""hands"" instead. The mask is now modernized and even looks slightly elongated. The fact that Lego added his golden mask was brilliant as I never owned the origanal. 

Pros:
- Its tahu for crying out loud
- The set is modified to fit the new standards, but kina looks wierd when compared to the old tahu
- Flame Sword

Cons:
- Kinda short
- Tahus eyes werent green and the face part the was given does not match the set.

"KJM72","2009-12-05T09:42:36.983Z","Well... It's Not The Best...","(This review comes from my LEGO.com Account)

Tahu isn't the best set there is.

His sword is a little awkward because of the pre-bent arms and the large size of the sword itself. However, the sword is in a new color: orange blended with red. The colors are nice, because orange is a relatively rare color in Bionicle sets. The new armor pieces are quite nice.

One of the worst parts of Tahu is the head. It juts out way to far and adds to the awkward appearance that the completed set has. His mask doesn't fit on a 2004-2008 head, which ruins an otherwise cool mask. The gold mask included suffers from the same problems that the red mask has. It's too small, and seemingly useless because of the fact that it only fits on the weird head included in the set.

One of the best parts if the set is the new feet.

.:Pros:.
-Nice armor
-Orange
-Newly colored sword
-feet

.:Cons:.
-Awkward arms+large sword= (>_<)
-Head juts out and adds to the bad look
-Mask only fits on bad head
-Gold mask suffers from the same problems
Overall, Tahu is okay. Is he worth it? Sure, if you want the pieces to make your own creations. If you just want the set to display, wait until it goes on sale. $8 USD is too much money when you take into consideration that the set looks... bleh. I would recommend Gresh Stars instead.

"deadtree103","2009-12-17T15:43:47.53Z","A worthy finish.","The stupidest decision in the history of stupid decisions was for lego to end Bionicle. But I'm not going to rant about that here.

THE CAN
Despite being small sets, the Stars are packed in little cans that are about the same height as a Glatorian Legends Canister, and surprisingly, there isn't too much empty space in them. On the front there is a nice CGI image of Tahu, who seems to be standing in the middle of a desert with a Hau background, plus the regular peice count and the normal legal text.(Heres a hint, never pay attention to the age limit, but the age requirement can be used as an excuse in the right circumstances)Turning it around to the back, and see the BIO code(Wich is Go Tahu in Leet), the picture advertising the other Stars and how they Each have a gold armor peice used on Tahu, and finally a picture of Tahu going into his can for storage. There is also a nice Skrall sheild design on top.

THE CONTENTS OF THE CAN
I'll start off with the instruction book, yes, you heard me right, this version does have an instruction BOOK. Nothing spectacular though, but there is an ad for Ben 10(Grr)and a new acnielsen ad thats in green with some ten year old dork with his mouth open looking like hes constipated, theres also a pile of box corners on one side. 11 out of the 19 parts are either new peices or recolors, and the new feet and armor should be useful in MOCing, because the feet have an axle hole on the bottom, making it very useful for chest armor. The Gold Hau seems to be a third type of gold, its not as dark as the 01-05 gold, but its not as bright as the 06-09 gold, and it looks really good, like natural gold.

THE SET
Not really that much to say really, just the standard nine points of articulation for an Agori/ Av-matoran build.

OVERALL
I'll list the pros and cons now.

PROS :)
*Lots of recolors and new parts.
*new gold.
*New armor peices.
*Awesome canister.
*ITS FREAKING TAHU!

CONS :(
*New Acneilsen ad sucks . . . . .Hard.
*Av-matoran build.
*Did I mention that the acneilsen ad sucks?

He is one of my favorite sets in Bionicle history. I have collected as many forms of Tahu as possible since he is my favorite Toa. I like the Golden Hau that this set comes with. It is a very nice shade of gold. Probably the best shade there can be. I have also recieved all of the Stars and created the Tahu in the Golden Bionicle form. I seem to like him better in this form. But anyways, onto the review:

Set:

Pros:
2 Haus!
Tahu
Different colored Flame sword
Nice Orange and Red Shade like the old Tahu Mata

Cons:
-Has a green head/eyes from the Av-Matoran sets, makes him look strange and you can't really point out his eyes, you only see a bunch of green
-Random Silver Nuva Shoulder armor with sword, should be orange or red
- Too Small, could have been a bit bigger, Tahu, and the masks

Canister:

Pros:
Nice Skrall sheild on top
Hau in background is very nice

Cons:
None

Instructions:
They are very nice, it is not a hard build. There is an image that reminds me of the good old days of Bionicle on the first page with all the stars on it with a Hau on the background and Golden Tahu with his Flame Sword in the Air. Unfortunately, it has an ad for Ben10.

good color scheme (i'm not crazy about the orange chest plate, but hey)

<p>Does this set really live up to the original Tahu? Lets find out.</p>
<p><b>BUILDING EXPERIENCE</b> - Seriously, we've seen this build since 2008. I'm not going over it. Building wasn't that fun, new, or exciting. They did however add some parts to it like the armor to make him look a little different from your average Agori or Av-Matoran. But really, nothing new.</p>
<p><b>PARTS</b> - You get a new Hau! Sadly it doesn't fit on the old Toa Mata head, but I don't think many people really use that head very much in MoCing. But if you wanted to put it on the original Tahu, you can't. The fire sword is a nice blend of red and orange making it look more fiery. And there's also all the cool armor pieces that adds a little more to the figure. The feet are also cool and make him stand well.</p>
<p><b>PLAYABILITY AND POSEABILITY</b> - Do to the arms and legs being solid pieces, you don't have any knee or elbow movement. But you can get him in a number of decent poses. He is overall more poseable than the original Tahu. As far as Playability, he's fun to fight the Rahkshi, Skrall, and Piraka, but it's even more fun when you give him the ...</p>
<p><b>GOLDEN ARMOR</b> - When you get all the Stars sets, you can upgrade Tahu by switching the armor out with the gold pieces. He still looks good in this form, but I would have liked to see some armor on the legs. With the armor, he looks like he can take on anything that comes at him.</p>
<p><b>ANYTHING ELSE?</b> - There's not much else. I do like that they gave him a bottom for his sword. But I don't like the head. The original problem with it is that it sticks out pretty far from his body. also, the way the mask hooks up, it leaves a piece of the head visible giving him a chin. Or a beard. And if you don't like the fact about lack of poseability in some areas, remember, the original didn't have that either.</p>
<p><b>OVERALL AND VALUE</b>&nbsp;- I do recommend him. He does, for the most part, live up to his original self and it is a good updated version. For eight dollars, I do think it is a good deal. Tahu was an iconic character and this does not dissapoint.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5

<p>Parts: The parts, in my opinion, are too big and bulky making it hard to make it hard to MOC with</p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T12:33:28.02Z","Bionicle No Clever Title this time.","<p>Set #7116 Bionicle Stars Tahu: The end of an era is marked by six sets from the beginning of this year known as the Bionicle Stars, each one a representation of one of the factions from this beloved Technic theme, each one including a Golden Bionicle Piece to turn Tahu into the Golden Toa... And each one is well worth the price they are offered for because they are, after all, Bionicle versions of the Impulse sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a great deal this past weekend on three of the six, getting them for 5$ each on sale and I am not dissapointed with that in the slightest, even at full price these little sets can be highly enjoyable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tahu is built using Technic pieces that I am not as familiar with as some of the older pieces - it is a simple to build model with very few pieces and once he's done he looks a little shorter than past Bionicle offerings, but that's ok. Why? Because these sets aren't supposed to be to scale, they're supposed to be cheap anniversary sets offered by LEGO to prove that Bionicle wasn't for nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I particularly prefer the smaller scale because it's much easier to display all of my Bionicle figures and store them now, the cases that they come in are quite good for easy storage compared to the rounder tubes of the original Toa. I also prefer the weapon piece that Tahu has compared to the older version, this one looks more solid and wider compared to the original Tahu's flame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last thing, I prefer this version to the original because it doesn't include any gear gimmicks, so that you can pose the figure and not have floppy arm problems due to the gimmick. As far as Bionicle is concerned, I enjoyed it, I didn't follow the whole backstory and such as much as other fans, but it was much better than the old Throwbots Technic line before it. And these Bionicle Stars are a nice little batch of six figures that can stand in my collection to represent one of the hottest selling LEGO products outside of the Star Wars franchise. Will Hero Factory live up to the Bionicle mythos as a new franchise? I don't know, but it's better than letting the Bionicle mythos become so overpopulated that you just can't be bothered with picking up any more new Toa or Villain sub-themes.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,5
"matoro99","2011-08-08T08:57:22.84Z","Pretty Good...","<p>&nbsp;This set, in my opinion, was only satisfactory. Also, Tahu Star is really a $7.99 matoran or agori that wears a mask of power and carries a sword that looks like fire. But, as far as bionicle goes, it does have some rare peices and you can easily position it and move it around. With that, it's time for pros and cons:</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>A golden kanohi hau (the first one since 2002) 
<li>A fire sword piece (you have to admit, it looks better than ackar's)</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool arm and chest plate pieces (if you are looking for those, takunuva star is better)</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Haven't they already made tahu three other times? 
<li>The original tahu (2001)&nbsp;was better. 
<li>What's with the silver handle? 
<li>He is an original bionicle not a bara magnan. what's with the glatorian hands? 
<li>He is practically a matoran of light (2008) with a mask of power and a fire shooting weapon.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; Personally, I think tahu in 2001 was better I learned the hard way, you shoulden't have to. Only get Bionicle stars for the golden pieces exept for the rakhshi and piraka they look pretty cool. Tahu Star is a disgrace to&nbsp;Tahu Mata! Only buy Tahu&nbsp;Mata (his arms move)!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,5,4

<p>It is sad to see the BIONICLE theme end, I know it is a little late for that, but let's get to the Review:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tahu as you know has been one of the first six toa heroes back in 2001, and it is great to see him again. This is his fourth variant: Toa Mata, Toa Nuva, Mistika, and Star. All of the BIONICLE Stars have a golden piece, Tahu comes with a Golden Tahu Mask. It is NOT the same as the original one back in 2001, but it is still very nice. As for the head, it is the same one as the Av-Matoran from 2008. It also comes with a new exclusive piece that can only be found in the Stars. It is on his chest and arms&nbsp;and it looks pretty good. The Colors of Tahu are the same as the previous Tahus seen in 2001 and 2002, Bright Red and Orange. Another Exclusive Piece is the feet. As for the Weapon, he only has one weapon, but that is not a problem. It is the same weapon that Ackar has except it has a new color of red and orange mixed together&nbsp;instead of just orange. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every detail from this 19 piece Star is Brilliant, even though it only has 19 pieces. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<ul><li>-Sure, Tahu's been done three times before, but this one is an excellent remake of the original, especially with the new sword.<br></li><li>-The golden armor collection, once completed, is just grand and amazing once put on Tahu.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>

<ul><li>-I think the sword hilt is fine, but it does look a bit odd.<br></li><li>-I also find the loss of functionality hurtful since the original at least had some, even though it was limited.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is one of the last Bionicle sets ever made, and will miss the series as a whole. Buy this if you find it at a really low price, and try to find all of the golden pieces if you can. Happy hunting!<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
