Pros:
1 cool weapons 
2 nice amour 

Cons:
1 Cannot bend knees or elbows
2 too much green",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KJM72","2009-12-05T09:56:36.217Z","Worth It, For Sure!","I would recommend Gresh over Tahu any day.

One of his strong points is the amount of new pieces. We have new feet, recolored blades, the gold armor piece, the all lime helmet, the armor, and the dark green body. This set has it all.

Once put together, this set looks stunning. Although you can't move his head around so much, his overall appearance makes up for it. The silver blades look great, and they should be very useful when MOCing. The lime green eyes look a lot better than the red eyes that were on the first Gresh. Gresh's color scheme really comes through. His upper legs are a little too skinny, but that can be easily ignored.

The build is boring, unsurprisingly. If you've built a 2008 Matoran or a 2009 Agori, this is pretty much the same thing. The inclusion of armor was a great idea. It really spices up an otherwise bland build, as do the feet.

The gold piece included in the set can be used to ""power up"" Tahu, when used with the other gold pieces from the rest of the Stars.

.:Pros:.
-New feet
-Recolored helmet
-Recolored blades
-New Armor
-Stunning Appearance
-Color scheme
-Gold piece
-Lime eyes work great

.:Cons:.
-Difficult to move head
-A little pricey
-Skinny upper legs

I would recommend Gresh in a heartbeat. I have Tahu as well (check my review), and I like Gresh a lot better.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Republic_Commando_Sev","2010-02-14T17:17:55.25Z","One Of The Best Stars!","<p>Well, I haven't written a review in forever, and since I got some Lego's for Christmas, I thought I'd review them</p>
<p>So, I got 2 of the Sars for Christmas, Gresh and Tahu (which I'll review later.)</p>
<p>First, I'll talk about the pieces. Gresh includes 19 pieces, 9 of which are recolored, or new. (Including the gold armor. More on that later.) Piece wise, Gresh is a good star to get. I especially like the three lime green armor pieces he has. It really makes him look like he's from the jungle.I like the new feet that some of the Stars have as well. It fits them well. The only problem with the feet, is that they are <i>really </i>hard to take off.</p>
<p>He has a recolored Mask, which looks good. I like it better then his precious light green/dark green mask. He also has two recolored blades. They look good in silver as well.</p>
<p>Building wise, he isn't so good. Like I said earlier, he only has 19 pieces so you can build him in probably less then 5 minutes, and not even use the instructions.</p>
<p>The finished product is really cool. He looks really good. The two green colors work together really well, and, to my surprise, the blades don't look to bad on him. I was afraid since he was so small, the blades would be too big for him, but they work. He also has&nbsp;a lot more play value then I thought he would.</p>
<p>He also includes one of the six gold pieces you need to make the &quot;Golden Bionicle&quot;. It is the sholder/chest piece for Tahu. It's a really neat piece, and it's in gold, so why wouldn't you like it? ;-)</p>
<p>Pricewise, I think the Stars are priced pretty good. They arn't overly expensive, but I wouldn't mind a dollar or two cheaper. I think their worth it though.</p>
<p>Overall, I am very pleased with Gresh. Even though the build is short, it's fun, he comes in good colors, and he has a lot of interesting pieces.</p>
<p>If your looking to buy a Star, I would recomend that you get Gresh.</p>

Building: Read my review on Tahu and the basics will come to you.


Pieces: Silver doesn't fit. I just love the new armor pieces, though. But, like I said, silver doesn't fit. Please note that the helmet is recolored; light green.


Playability: My review on Tahu is the same here.


Price: Same here too.


Overall: Gresh is a bit better than Tahu. The armor pieces are new and cool, and the only con is: Silver doesn't fit.

"benjadude11","2010-02-06T21:40:22.06Z","3rd best star, which is still pretty good, cause y'know, they're stars...","I got the original gresh last year, and he was my favorite bionicle put out since the piraka, so I was glad to see him chosen as a star. Pros and cons, here we go.

Pros: 
chest, arm plates really nice
silver remakes of his original weapons
same head as before
green iron-man head (looks better than red in my not-so-humble opinion)
really expressive
it's hard to call a bionicle realistic, but you look at him and feel like the plastic is going to come to life and start walking around

Cons:
head has limited range of motion

overall, 5/5

His new feet are pretty nice. They even have a plus rod connector on the bottom. His chest and shoulder armor are also new, and this is the only set so far where you can get these pieces.

Rangers TV show which was supposed to be only for the red ranger (I've 
forgotten the name of the special armor). I really like this figure but I wish the BIONICLE Stars figures would be bigger.

<p>Great design</p>

This Gresh's arms are puny. He can barley move them, let alone attack with them. But thank god that his weapons can still connect to do the shield thing. I mean, he's practicly known for his awesome shield. But it should be green, not silver. And he also comes with a golden piece.",FALSE,3,4,2,3,3
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-14T13:01:03.06Z","The Golden Toa is Complete!","<p>Set #7117 Gresh: I finally picked up the last of the Bionicle Stars from TRU last week, sadly I didn't get it on sale so it loses a point in value for money because of that, I feel that 10.99$ for 19 pieces is a bit high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gresh is still a fun model to play with though and fast to build, he's a great compact little action figure in LEGO form, sadly his weapons are not as good as the other six because they are very wide and long hindering the poseability of the arms during play because of course this impulse set doesn't include elbow joints. I'd still recommend him though because the Bionicle Stars are really as a group of six a great little group to play with and perhaps MOC into something different by combining pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Golden Toa: The Gimmick LEGO gave us for the final Bionicle sets was that by picking up all six you got six extra pieces to turn Tahu into a Golden version of Tahu. That's pretty much it. Tahu with golden armor, a golden shield, a golden mask and a golden sword hilt. He does look impressive, but all of that red kind of sticks out still, perhaps LEGO should have included two pieces a set to give Tahu golden feet, hands, arms and legs too... But then the Gold pieces wouldn't stand out as much as they do in that sea of red.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall The Golden Toa is ok, Gresh is ok, his weapons are unfortunate, perhaps there's a way to have him hold them better, but I haven't figured that out yet. Still I recommend this Bionicle Stars set because you need all six to build the Golden Toa and they represent some fun action figure style LEGO toys that you can play with and even MOC using the pieces with if you want.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"tkettle9719","2012-01-08T11:53:14.963Z","Glatorian Toa Power!","<p>I got this set for myself at Target, and think that this, like all of the other Stars sets, this is a great remake of a great character, but in a smaller form. <br></p>

"ksprice45","2016-02-24T20:00:26.017Z","Great Idea, okay execution.","<p>When the stars originally came out i didn&#39;t buy any of them, they had bad articulation, and not the best pieces, i was also 9 at the time and didnt&nbsp;like bionicle&nbsp;that much because it had way to many specialized terms and i had no clue what was going on at the end of the story. Anyways i picked this guy up at Brickcon&nbsp;2014!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is good it fits along really well with the theme for the year.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are ok, the best pieces are the helmet in a solid lime green, the lime armor pieces, the gold piece, and his weapons in pure silver.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build goes really quick and simple, it is an AV-matoran&nbsp;build, so it is quick and easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Gresh&nbsp;looks great! Despite him not having elbow or knee joints you can get some awesome poses! His blades are oversized for him but look really cool that way. Not much to say though, you get what comes on the front of the box!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like this set. The simplicty&nbsp;is fun in a way of not having to deal with all the extra joints, which makes him MUCH easier to pose than the traditional Inika&nbsp;build. He does have the squared off joints so the socket parts will break if you aren&#39;t careful. I have had him for a while and have had no problem with it. In a nutshell 4/5. Great set with some issues.</p>
