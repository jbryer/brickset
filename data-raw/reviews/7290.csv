pros:
twin staffs
silver mask
shoulder armor
new feet

cons:
head sticks out
should be bigger

It is a good choice for the white stars set. The silver works great (gold would belittle the golden tahu). I think silver shoulders would have worked better but these still look nice. Who likes lists!

Pros:
Original mask of light
same weapons
good colors
more poseable than the original

Cons:
Head sticks out akward but still works

Over buy this set.

Seriously go out and buy it now

"Kalhiki","2010-04-16T19:17:03.14Z","My favorite Stars set","Ugh. I don't like that CGI picture<br>I wanted to do a quick review, and I happen to have Takanuva around. As you can already tell, he has the same Avtoran/Agori build, which by now I've gotten used to. The colors are gray, white, and silver. The only silver on him, though, is his mask and light staffs.<br>Beings as though it is the Agori build, I'm not going to go into&nbsp;any detail. Basically it's snap, snap and you're done.&nbsp;However there are some spots (armor) that makes the build a bit different. The&nbsp;nuva shoulder armor makes him look bulkier and sets him apart from the Mata&nbsp;design of Tahu Stars. Sadly, the armor can get in the way a bit.&nbsp;<br>The only new piece is the body armor, which looks very good. It has what I call an organic look to it. The Avhokii is also the new pearly color instead of flat silver. While I'm doing the parts, I want to say he has the Avtoran head. That ugly, ugly Avtoran head that sticks out too far.<br>Playability is a little... Limited. As I've said time and time again, it's the Agori build which means no elbows or knees. The head is also a little limited. But he's still fun to play with. And with his two light staffs it makes it even better.<br>The value for the money is okay. But we should all be used to Lego's a tad over pricey-ness.<br>Overall, a good set. He's my favorite Star, so I'm trying not to be biased. But I do highly recommend getting him.",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"benjadude11","2010-02-07T17:50:51.45Z","Well, he's not icy, but...","I was surprised when Takanuva was chosen as the ice representative on the bionicle stars team, because when he was first released, he was the toa of light, not of ice. Bionicle has made so many good ice bionicles (kopaka, strakk, even nuju) that i was disappointed that the best white bionicle wasn't actual ice. If takanuva wasn't so cool, I might even be mad. Oh well.

Pros:
mask is the same piece as was first released
nice arm and shoulder pieces
good color
bottom end of staff pieces are really good for MOCing

Cons:
Not ""icy""
Head under mask is strange

Overall, get this set, as well as all the other stars. They are definetly worth it.

My ranking for stars is as follows: #1 Tahu #2 Rahkshi #3 Gresh #4 Takanuva #5 Piraka #6 Skrall. However, they are all 5 star sets except for Skrall.

"Alemas","2010-05-15T18:12:39.077Z","Takanuva's back!","<h4>Overview</h4>Originally, Takanuva was launched in 2003, along with an Ussanui, a flying vehicle. In 2008, he was re-launched, bigger and better, but with black details. Now, in the last year of Bionicle, he returns with the original Mask of Light.<br><h4>Features</h4>1) Golden piece of armour that you put on Tahu<br>2) Ummm... moveable head, arms and legs? Not much...<br><h4>Building Experience</h4>Hmm... took me 1 minute maximum, so not so good. 3/4<br><h4>Parts</h4>Ok, we have a golden piece of armour which you can put on Tahu, the ORIGINAL Mask of Light(fits on original head block!), white Toa Nuva shoulder pads, and a couple of blades. Pretty good. 4/5<br><h4>Playability</h4>As in all other Stars, this has no elbow or knee articulation, so it suffers with poseability. Also, the shoulder pads limits movement of the arms a bit. BUT, the longer arms and legs make things a bit more bearable. 3/5<br><h4>Value for Money</h4>Â£6.99 for this? Better than the others! 4/5<br><h4>Overall</h4>This is better than the other Stars. Having the ORIGINAL Mask of Light is a BIG plus, but the fixed arms and legs make this set just about good. 4/5",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
"NickBrick","2010-11-12T16:37:50.54Z","So long Bionicle. We will miss you","Takanuva is good Bionicle. And probably the second best Star. While the set lacks in piece&nbsp; count. You do get some good pieces. The Mask of Light is really the best part about the whole set. Takanuva's weapons are twin light staffs with new rod pieces. The new feet are flat. But do not fall over. The gold armor however is use less without Tahu. Now is there anything bad about this set? Well a few things come to mind. Like the fact that Takanuva's neck juts out so far that he looks like an old man. The staffs can also hinder the playability. All things considered. This is still a good set. pick one up if you still can. Good bye Bionicle. Hopefully someday Lego will bring it back. They did it with Adventurers. Why not with Bionicle?<br>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,4

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T12:42:22.797Z","Toa of Light","<p>Set #7135 Takanuva Bionicle Stars: This being my first Takanuva model/figure I can not truly compare it to past offerings of the character, however I can talk about how much I enjoy this model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find that the Bionicle Stars Impulse sets are a great and wonderful addition to any Bionicle collection. True they aren't as big or detailed as the older figures, but they can be built in relatively short amounts of time and then you have a group of figures that you can play with to your hearts content without worrying about breaking anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bionicle Stars don't have gimmicks, they're just that, LEGO action figures and a far cry better than the Galidor stuff LEGO put out. Takanuva comes with two weapons, the Mask of Light and of course a golden piece to build the Golden Toa. (I'm not sure on what the backstory is for that, but it's a neat little addition to the six sets and makes you want to go out and get them all no matter what.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new hands and feet are a nice touch from LEGO Bionicle too, compared to the older stuff. I stopped collecting Bionicle after a time because there was just too much to keep up with, so these new figures are a good way to have representations from some parts of the theme you may not have been interested in at the time. And for the price they're asking I can say it's definitely worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're still on the fence about these because of their size or their piece count I say don't let it worry you too much, these are fun to build, fun to play with and all around fun to have standing on the shelf in nifty action poses.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,5
