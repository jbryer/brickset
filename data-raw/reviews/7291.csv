Pros:

1 nice colors
2 black Kopaka blade
3 very evil looking
4 has the highest piece count along with Takanuva of all the stars
5 Multiple weapons

Cons:

1 Not enough green on legs
2 Giraffe neck
3 extra joint behind neck",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"_phoenix","2009-12-29T13:46:57.077Z","Skrall are on the move!","This set is one of my favorite of the star series. It was alright at first but then I took it apart and made it into one of the full-sized skrall with instructions on the internet. The overall design and the sword are great reasons that you should get this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"michaelvader","2010-02-01T07:00:12.45Z","The WORST STAR.","I would of gave a 3 but because they are the last sets, you have to get ALL OF THEM! So the build is kinda like the Rahkshi. And this is worst part, His head sticks out WAY too much! The head dose stick out on the Rahkshi but it works with the set. So I took off that piece and put his head on the body.But if you do that put more armor on.

OK so the arms are fine not great nor bad but just fine. The green hands come very useful if you MOC like me. And then the sword. ...  IT SUCKS OK!? It has no bottom. 

overall still get this set but let it be your last. 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"kaboomlegoman","2010-02-14T17:40:01.153Z","Really good.","This is a really cool set. He has an original Kopaka sword in black, and he has a piece that only appears in one other set. (Nocturn;the connection to shoulder blades)


Building: Pretty straightforward, like I said on my other Star reviews.


Pieces: Really good parts. Like I said, the shoulder blade connectors only come in Nocturn.


Playability: Same on other Stars.


Price: Same as well.


Overall: Skrall is a nice addition to the Bionicle Stars.",FALSE,4,4,3,2,2
"benjadude11","2010-02-07T18:10:13.747Z","Three good reasons","Skrall being chosen as an all-'star' steams me up. However, I will approach this review in a calm and collected way by listing three good reasons why skrall should not be a star.
1- The first skrall stunk
2- visorak were so much cooler
3- well, I only have two reasons, but really, isn't that enough?
Anyway, lets do pros and cons. Gotta make this quick, the super bowl is on in 20 minutes.

Pros:
black, vintage kopaka sword
pieces attaching sword to shoulder are really useful (plus, they're green)

Cons:
face looks like it's sucking a lemon (as did the original skrall) 
shoulder things get in the way of posability 
really long awkward neck
iffy color scheme (the first Skrall were red and black, why shouldn't these be?)
feet don't match rest of physique (they aren't spiky enough)

This is the only star that isn't a five stars set. Get it, though, because this is the last round of bionicles. *sob*   ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-25T21:43:53.03Z","Final Skrall fights for the bottom of a sword... ","This is a set where you say, ""Wow, well, he looks cool, I guess..."" Well, yeah, you're right. This is cool, not too good for the price, though. The part that really impresses me is the head. Here are some Pros and Cons:

Pros:

1. Somewhat posable

2. Shoulder blades are pretty cool

Cons:

1. Shoulder blades cause this set to be not as posable

2. Sword=lame!

3. Not worth price for playabilty and pieces

4. What with that stub on the back?

Parents: This set is kind of challenging, so your child may need some help connecting parts. Other than that, it is a pretty easy set to build.

BUY THIS WITH ANOTHER SET! Ok, just a little comment. 3/5 is my rating.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"lavalizard78","2010-04-08T14:37:56.7Z","Elite Atakus?","              This guy isn't really the best, but not the worst, either. I give this set a 3/5 because it is nice to build your army for only $8, but you won't have a really lethal army. 

                 Building was shamefull of BIONICLE, as i could build it just by looking at the canister. I didn't expect that, but it was still fun to build. 

                     His neck is...weird. He has a hunched-over look, like Strakk. His arm reach isn't long, so don't expect to be able to slaughter any Agori. I love the black Kopaka sword: it looks so sweet. He doesn't have a shield, which was a dissapointment to me. I fixed that in 2 minutes. I took the shield from a Rahkshi and put a half rod, half pin, peice in the shield si the ""Skrall"" could hold it like the other Skrall
         
              I don't call this guy a Skrall, because he doesn't come with a shield, so i call him an ""Elite Atakus"".

           Playability is good: the usual articulation of a BIONICLE. His arm reach is short. I mean real short. He can still shank someone, or slice, but not really hack and slash like the other Skrall. It's still fun to have battles between this ""Skrall"" and an Agori.

Overall: Worth buying to add to your army,  fun to build, play, and i recommend that you get this set before it goes off the shelf for good. (Last BIONICLE wave)  

    Thanks for reading and this is an excellent set for collecting, MOCing, playing, and building your Skrall army.

Armor!
old blade

Not good for posing

"ndb","2010-05-11T17:57:00.797Z","Okay...","<p>This is one of my first Bionicle sets, and a very nice one, may I add. While most fans hate the Stars, I like them. They&nbsp;seem made&nbsp;for sitting on the shelf, and that's fine with me. They are still fun with to play with, on the other hand. A nice combination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice parts</p>
<p>Can make some neat poses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not very poseable due to the sword decorations.</p>
<p>The head is mounted on a leg piece, which doesn't look that great, and limits a lot of head movement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poseablity is a major issue on this figure, and most kids that&nbsp;I let play with my Bionicles let this figure off to the side because it can't clash swords with Gresh or Takanuva. A nice figure, but still lacks.</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,3
"KodakKid365","2010-11-16T23:52:56.287Z","Cool","The Skrall is a cool set. It comes with a golden piece and he looks cool. I just don't like the short arms and legs. The weapon is nice and so is the arm armor. Big hint: don't put the golden piece on him. It wasn't meant for him but for Tahu and it just dosen't look right. Gold with black and green? Not happening.",FALSE,4,3,2,3,3
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T12:53:33.407Z","Skrall, what's a Skrall?","<p>Set #7136 Skrall Bionicle Stars: I have no idea what a Skrall is, but it is definitely menacing looking even when you're building it with so few pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me that many fans of Bionicle feel that this is one of the weaker sets from Bionicle Stars, I have to wonder why that is? Perhaps I should look at some pictures of the older set and compare the two to find out why, but for right now I'm just going to review this and tell you all why I think it's a good set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skrall is a very interesting looking Bionicle figure, his head features a long pointy edge, which makes me wonder if he tries to skewer Toa on it or not... The arm things, wings? Whatever they are they make for an interesting looking figure, it's one of the only unique ones from the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the Skrall doesn't take too long, but once he's built you get to have a really fun little figure to play with, if you also have Takanuva they look good paired off against one another. (With Tahu vs. Rahkshi and Gresh vs. Piraka the colors really stand out vibrantly.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd say this set is well worth the price and I don't know why others think it's so weak, but I don't happen to agree with them. I like all the Bionicle Stars and can't wait to add Gresh and Piraka to my collection so I can finish building the Golden Toa and complete my Bionicle collection. (Barring the sets scaled for Mini-Figures.)</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5
