"Lars","2009-10-08T12:08:28.467Z","To much new themes","I was disapointed when i got this book today, for example, the train theme, only 2 pages and the theme has been there for the 70s!

The other book standing small, was a litte bit better. If you want a ""Lego index book"" dont buy this. This books seems more to me like commercial for the 2009 sets. If you like me are born in the 80Â´s you want to read more about the 80s and 90s themes. If you are a hardcore legofan I think you should buy it.

Pros
You got 2 books when you buy this, the lego book and standing small.
Good quality of the book, nice pictures, you can read about the lego history.

Cons
Almost only new themes, all themes arent included, only 2 pages legotrain. Seems more like commercial for the newest sets.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"LegoAdventures","2009-10-10T00:45:54.543Z","A great Collectors book","In my opinion i think The Lego Book is a really handy book for anyone.  I have to say it has a lot of great information for anyone who want's to learn more about Lego or just have a look at the amazing Clear High resolution pictures. I recently picked this Great book up for $65 AUD at Borders book shop. I think it is worth the money seeing you get 2 Magnificent books, The Lego Book and Standing Small in a lovely Hard cover which enables you to slide both books into a safe case to keep them clean and protected. I have to disagree unfortunately with the person's comment below. The book happens to have images from 1934 to at least 2009 and there is numerous images from all those old loved themes like Castle, Pirates, Town, Adventures, Wild West and even old Space. ((There is old themes and new themes bunched together like a picture book eg. Old castle sets and New Castle sets combined)). Although i would have liked a couple more pages on other themes like Harry Potter and Exoforce and not to mention my Favorite Theme Adventures I'm still glad to see the Majority of many loved sets in these 2 top quality wonderful books. These books are a definite great value buy if you love Lego and all its many great sets and Minifigs.

5/5 Thank you for reading, :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"alva","2011-02-27T20:44:22.367Z","Great book about Lego","This is a book that really intended for a hardcore AFOL. It present a lot of Lego history, starting with this small company specialized in building wooden toys, and then changing to plastic building toys and grow up to the company we love today.<br><br>It contains a lot of trivia about Lego that most people dont know, such as what is the meaning of Lego, when was the first minifig come up, when was the minifig firstly having a non standard smiley face, etc. They also come up with a nicely done Lego timeline, showing most of the sets that ever made by Lego.<br><br>Keep in mind that this is not a Lego catalog, so it wont show all the sets ever created. It only gives you a big view of what Lego have done.<br><br>This book also come with a bonus, a minifig catalog titled Standing Small. Showcasing a lot of minifigs from many themes.<br><br>I recommended to have one for all the AFOL out there. <br>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5
"Mr__Football","2010-09-21T00:24:04.2Z","Outstanding Book, Very Informative and Beautifully Assembled","I purchased this along with the Star Wars Visual Guide. I'm really impressed with the layout of this book. I love how they detail the company history, the legendary patents, and the progression to the Lego plastic brick we all know and love. Great photos and summaries of terrific Lego sets down through the years. It's like the Lego Star Wars Visual Guide on steroids. The accompanying Minifigure book is great as well. I enjoy looking at these books as much as my kids do. A must have for any Lego enthusiast. Check for deals online!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T21:03:02.11Z","LEGO Knowledge Wrapped up in a Colorful Presentation","<p>The LEGO Book, this title will tell you quite a bit of information concerning the LEGO Company, it breaks things down by year and showcases a lot of different bits of information. First is the Company Info itself, this is followed up by the numerous Themes that LEGO has released through the years. Then there is some information on LEGOLAND and of course LEGO Video Games... I might be forgetting some of what is mentioned. It has been roughly a year since I first read it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This book is a great source of information on the company, but if you're interested in learning about a particular Theme some of the information is a tad condensed when we get out of the larger Themes and into the smaller stuff such as Adventurers or Western. Still what is covered is highly informative and presented quite nicely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a lot of photos in this book, obviously there isn't a complete photographic record of all LEGO Sets released by the company, but that isn't precisely what this book is for. I think this is a great addition to any LEGO Fans collection if you've ever wanted to read up on the company or just glance through at some pictures of the highlights of your favorite Theme than this book is one you can't pass up. I especially enjoy the pages dedicated to AFOLs who have crafted wonderful and amazing works of art out of LEGO, those really inspire me to try and look at LEGO in a new and different light. If you haven't already picked up The LEGO Book, I strongly recommend picking it up. I hope in the future DK and LEGO will release new and interesting titles as a companion to this book and Standing Small. I'll be keeping my eyes open on what may develop. There's still a lot of potential for good LEGO books.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5
"brickfanatic","2014-04-24T04:57:50.34Z","The ONE Book that states the START!","<p>I just manage to get my hands on this hardback copy of THE LEGO BOOK by Daniel Lipokowitz and the accompanying bonus book of STANDING SMALL by Nevin Martell at a good price!!</p>

<h3>The LEGO BOOK</h3>

<p>This book states all those figures and series that goes way back from my memory when i had my first lego set. It was gift from my dad when he was pumping petrol at the kiosk. It was the simple POLICE set. Next was the classic SPACE sets.</p>

<p>This book contains the history of how LEGO developed from other toys and also the how the BRICK was made down from the design, concept ad manufacturing of it!</p>

<p>They also include the various series and brings back memories of those old sets that you might had. LEGO CITY, LEGO EXOFORCE, etc. You name it they have it!</p>

<p>It is a good read and a good book to keep for all LEGO Fans and also to all who remember your childhood toys!</p>

<p>Good introduction and illustration for the kids as well!</p>

<h3>STANDING SMALL</h3>

<p>This is another good book which illustrates all the LEGO minifigures, including the design and development of initial LEGO minifigures and how it was evolved into the finnal design!</p>

<p>This includes figures from all the series! I missed out on those from the SPORTS series and they were Awesome!</p>

<p>Another good keep for LEGO fans!</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>
