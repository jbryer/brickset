"parchioso","2009-10-05T09:19:31.467Z","A great collector item with an exclusive Celebration Luke minifig","Finally the long awaited book is available at local store, no need to say, it is a must-get for Lego Star Wars fans, aside from the colorful and high quality illustrations, you get the special edition of Luke Skywalker - Celebration Luke as the author calls it - An exclusive minifig where Luke dressed for the celebration scene at the end of Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope.

This 95 pages book nicely put together all the major Lego sets and minifigs produced, as a dictionary, it is not as comprehensive as an encyclopedia, but amazingly perfect as a collector item. It also brings attention to some special but less known items, for example, I only learn about the Zam Wesell's Airspeeder after reading this book. Other examples are the Geonosians and wookiees sections. There is also a Community section where great lego fans' work are being highlighted, I am not surprised to see that one of my favorite, Mark Borlase's recreation of Echo base, is there.

By the way, the book is not as thick as it appears to be, 50% of it are for containing the minifigs, so you get 95 viewing pages, which is less than 50 physical pages I believe, but since the price is quite reasonable, it is still very much worth the money.

"captain_radda_radda","2009-10-13T22:33:11.107Z","Whoa","In all honesty, I had no idea that this book would contain as large a database as it did. I mean this book has a profile on just about everything. The images are great and the amount of information given is astonishing. I learned so much by reading this book. Small facts and subsections are added on almost all the pages. The book is devided into 3 sections: Movie Saga, Clone Wars, and Collecters. On certain sets, dimensions and minifigs are given, but all sets feature a 4 part block of Year, Piece Amount, Set Number, and what Apperance the set made. I only wish that DK would have included prices as well. The Luke minifig is great and is one of the few Lukes with long hair. 

Pros:
Price $22 dollars is a steal considering that a star wars visual dictionary is 21 dollars on its own. 
Luke
The size of the database
The interview at the end
The overall amount of information is incredible
The images are really well shot

Con:
The small boxes do their part, but don't give enough information

Overall: A must have for any Star Wars or Lego fan in general. Get it well its hot. In my opinion, the Luke fig is worth 22 dollars alone. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Moscadini","2009-11-05T21:12:57.763Z","Great Information for a Lego Star War Dictionary","I want to say that they made this book very well made.  I like how they separated the characters as well as the ""playsets"" by sections.  Too bad they had the idea for the Yavin 4 Playset and it never made it out to the product line.  I did however find 1 mistake (I am sure there are a few others, but this one caught my eye)... On page 81, not only is the V-19 Torrent backwards, it is also upside down.  I am sure this is a minor mistake... but just wanted to give heads up on it.

Pros:
1. The price is excellent.
2. Luke Skywalker in Ceremonial Outfit.
3. Shows all the SW Legos that have been made.
4. They mention that the Hailfire is actually ""proportioned"" to the Mini-Figures unlike the regular set was not.
5. No ""Stickers"" :-P j/k

Cons:
None really.... thought they would split up the movies by Chapters rather then by sections.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

In the final pages of the book, there are pics of sets that might have been released. I find the pics to spark ideas in the minds of our MOC creators and our AFOLs. The book also showed some of the fantastic MOCs made by fans, and I must say that they are a true work of art! Also in the book is an interview with the one of the designers of Star Wars lego.

"Zacherano","2009-11-01T12:34:05.89Z","Phenomenal Content and Images by DK; Excellent Collector's Guide","     First of all, I want to thank Brickset for their excellent review of this new visual masterpiece by Dorling Kindersley.  I cannot wait to actually obtain this book and the Throne Room Luke minifigure included.  I have viewed the book more than once in a bookstore and I have read portions online and in the store, so I believe that I do know a fair amount about the material within the book.
     I would like to point out for the benefit of Lego Star Wars collectors such as myself that the authors of the book have undergone valiant and worthy efforts to satisfy the interests of collectors.  Throughout the book, the differing variations of a number of minifigures, such as Boba Fett, Han Solo, and Emperor Palpatine, have been described with careful attention to detail.  For example, in the ""Emperor Palpatine"" spread, a short blurb notes that the Palpatine figure in ""Imperial Inspection"" has a gray face and gray hands, while a similar Palpatine in ""Death Star"" has a gray face and black hands, an important distinction for collectors.  On the same spread, however, the book fails to mention that the Stormtroopers in ""Imperial Inspection"" have special printing on the legs which is unique to the Stormtroopers in this set. 
    Despite this minor discrepancy, the book is complete and beautiful in almost every respect, including sections at the end to discuss how the sets are produced, the Ultimate Collector's, Technic, and miniature sets, and even an interviewer with a set designer and master builder.  This book is well worthy of one's money, whether he/she is a collector or is interested in Lego, Star Wars, or any other fantastical aspect of the science fiction and toy universe.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rabk295","2011-02-27T17:00:54.03Z","A steal","My mom bought me this today at my local discount store, $6 dollars off. And man am I pleased! While I've recently become a WWII fanatic, I'm still a hardcore Star Wars fan at heart. This book is a great way to keep up with the sets that I have owned over the years, although more importantly the ones I haven't. The book provides detailed pictures along with descriptions to compliment them. Some descriptions and facts given are quite obvious, while others are interesting or about subjects you had not previously known about. The book also provides a chart of all the Lego Star Wars sets up until 2009, as well as pictures of most of the minifigures. The complimentary minifigure that comes with the book (a celebration Luke for you uninformed people) is quite nice although relatively useless. Still, he will look great on a shelf and provide me with bragging rights I'm sure! The book is well organized into three chapters which are:<br><br>Chapter 1: Original Saga<br><br>Chapter 2: The Clone Wars<br><br>Chapter 3: Specialist sets (such as technic or robotic sets)<br><br>And Chapter 4: Beyond the Brick. Possibly my favorite section, these pages show how prototype heads and characters, such as the Rebel Snowtrooper helmet and Kit Fisto's head. This section also explains how sets are designed, tested, and priced before release. It is a great way to get a peek at what's going on inside Lego Star Wars.<br><br>The book is a wonderful addition to my Lego collection, and I highly suggest that you purchase it if possible.<br><br>Overall I give the set a solid 10/10<br><br>My favorite part of all though is the description of ""Jedi Bob,"" the unnamed Jedi that came with the original Republic Gunship. I have to admit that I laughed when I read that!<br>",TRUE,5,5,1,1,5
"michaelvader","2010-01-23T17:04:21.123Z","My 50th Review! ","I like this book a lot. It is very useful, and has 4 very long chapters.  They have every single Lego Star Wars set up through 2009. I am going to start by reviewing the included exclusive Lego minifigure.

It comes with a new and exclusive Luke SkyWalker minifigure, with rare light blonde long hair, a regular  Luke head and a new exclusive body that commemorates the award ceremony at the end of episode IV. The gold medal that is on the torso is shiny and looks quite cool. The figure has the same brown legs as the Han Solo minifig. 

Now onto the book...

The Cover:
The cover is very nice and is a very big hardcover. It has a little pocket, as shown above (with the question mark) where the minifigure fits in. BrickSet should fix the picture and show an actual photo as it looks in real life.

Chapter 1 - Movie Saga:
The page representing the first chapter is like a big poster of a random battle from episode 3. Some of my favorite pages in this chapter are, a page that describes a lot of sets where an Anakin minifigure has been included. Another favorite is named Jedi Knights and shows, Mace Windu, Kit Fisto, Qui-Gon Jin, Luminara Unduli (who I think should have light green skin), Yoda, and Jedi Bob. The reason they call him Jedi Bob is because he could have been called Bob, or Frank, or an regular name. He was in the scene with Obi Wan and Anakin in the gun ship when Padme falls out. And who can pass by Bounty Hunters! 1st it shows Jango and Boba Fett Minifigures and describes them in detail along with Slave I. Zam Wessell, her ship, and IG-88 are detailed as well.

There are also 2 pages devoted to the ultimate Death Star 2008 set (which is still available). It has a whole data file on the page and much much more.

Chapter 2 - The Clone Wars (short but cool)

Again the page representing the chapter looks like a cool poster of set #10195, Republic Dropship with AT-OT Walker.

The first pages shows Jedi Command and Separatist Command figures and ships. The next page shows every 2008 & 2009 set that has clones. Another page shows almost all of the sets from 2008/2009 which have droids.

Chapter 3 - Specialist Sets

It shows every single Star Wars ""Mini"" Set every made on pages 80-81. Next it shows Lego Technic sets including Darth Vader, Jango Fett, etc. There is another 4 pages of ""Ultimate"" collector sets. Like the Darth Maul bust, the Yoda statue and the 18"" General Grievous figure.

Chapter 4 - Beyond the Brick

This is top secret, and I cannot spill the beans on what is inside this last chapter. So go buy the book! You won't regret it!

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-18T12:43:22.763Z","LEGO Force Skills Not Included","<p>LEGO Star Wars The Visual Dictionary: I'm really quite glad that LEGO and DK teamed up to give us a book in this vein, it offers up a lot of fun facts about the LEGO Star Wars theme as well as useful information on all of the sets released up to 2009. Despite being 'Out-Of-Date' as some have mentioned this item is still a must own for three important reasons, possibly four.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reason Number One: Luke Skywalker Ceremonial Outfit Mini-Figure is only included with this book. It is the only method to get a Mini-Figure version of Luke representing this final victory celebration scene from A New Hope. (Even if LEGO were to make a Yavin IV set finally I strongly doubt they would include this particular version of Luke.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reason Number Two: Resource Material. This Book is a strong bit of Resource Material on hand for when you can't access the internet and sites like Brickset that showcase the various sets released in the LEGO Star Wars theme. It is also quite useful despite not including anything from 2010 or 2011 because there is a section detailing the creation of things outside the main sets. Such as the video games and how LEGO decides what to include in the sets of the Theme, how they design it basically, even though it is only a few pages it's fascinating material.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reason Number Three: Pictures, Pictures and more Pictures. If you want to just stare at the sets and fantasize about owning them all someday then this book is for you, there are quite a number of pictures in the book and that includes all of the Technic and UCS sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reason Number Four: It's LEGO Star Wars! I mean seriously how can you not want to have a book like this in your collection, even if they make a revized edition much later on during the final year of the LEGO Star Wars Theme, which might not be until 2025 the rate the money keeps coming in on this lucrative team up, this book is still worth owning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally think this book is a great addition to my collection of LEGO based Books and I am hoping that perhaps in 2011 DK and LEGO might team up to make similar Visual Dictionaries for other Themes, such as the classic Town, the entire Pirates or Castle Theme and maybe even something similar for LEGO Harry Potter. And if they continue to include a rare or unique Mini-Figure with each book that would be awesome. If they were to make a LEGO Castle Theme book I'm sure they could come up with a great unique looking Mini-Figure to include with it. I digress however.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this is great. You can't build it, you can't play with it and the parts are limited to the number you get with the Luke Mini-Figure, but it's a wonderful book full of interesting facts, fun LEGO humor and a great source for keeping track of all the Mini-Figures that have been made since 2009. I am confidant that we'll see a future revised edition of this book someday, and if we do I hope they carry over the theme of the Mini-Figure and give us a Princess Leia Ceremonial Gown Mini-Figure, because that would be really something I'd want. Until then I'll keep reading and re-reading my LEGO Star Wars The Visual Dictionary and fantasizing about owning all the sets with Mini-Figures and some without as I stare longingly at the pictures.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5
