"I_like_Lego","2009-11-15T16:52:05.233Z","Great little snowman","I picked this set up yesterday when I was in Toys""R""us (hunting for 2010 sets) for $4.99 CDN (which is I think $3.49 US) along with 3009 Christmas Tree, Space Speeder, and 8399 K-9  Bot. This was the second set I opened when I got home. He may be small, but is a great set!

Pros :)
-Small
-Orange Cone Nose
-Nice little red tie
-Arms
-Broom
-Nicely made face
-New Piece

Cons :(
-Can't bend his arms Foreword
-What is there to play with?
-Expensive for 44 pieces at $4.99 CDN ($3.49 for Americans).

Overall:
8/10, great little set (it even has a secret code: HOLO09). Next set to review 30009 Christmas Tree.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"The_Green_Brick_Giant","2009-12-12T13:13:18.187Z","Great Ornament","This is a great set for what it is, an ornament.  It's not at all a playset, it's a quick build to display set.

It is possibly the best snowman LEGO has ever made, very nice looking set with a bright orange nose, and a perfectly designed brick built broom.

The only complaint I have is that the arms are black (They should have been brown) Star Wars robot arms and look to thin for this set, but otherwise perfect.

So go out and buy this cheap little set, it will look great on display.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"bajadogq","2009-12-17T23:01:07.093Z","A nice little set.","I got this set as a freebie the other day, and it now hangs proudly on my Christmas tree. It has a quick and easy build, and comes with quite a few spare pieces. The design looks strange at first, but it looks more and more snowman-like each time you glance at it. The only thing I don't like about it are those robot-arms. They just seem strange (shudder). No, I don't think it's the greatest set in the world, but it's a pretty nice addition to your Christmas tree (if you have one).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T17:50:25.9Z","Frosty the Snowman?","<p>Set #30008 Snowman: Buying this set was really a whim for me, I saw it on sale along with the Christmas Tree and I decided to pick it up. Both of them looked like they would make great conversation pieces if ever asked, and as a bonus they look quite nice on the shelf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Snowman is the real beaut of the two though, mainly because it can actually interact a little with the Mini-Figures in my collection and not look silly. (The Christmas Tree is a little bit out of whack scale wise.) This Snowman towers a little over the Mini-Figures, but that's the best part. The pieces for the nose and broom are also quite clever, and I like that they used Droid Arms to give this Snowman twig-like arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're looking to build up more for a christmas display this year trying to track down one of these might be time consuming, but it will be well worth the effort. The Snowman is a fun little set, and unlike the genuine article it won't melt come spring.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"shea42","2011-09-10T02:41:40.83Z","Not bad for a freebee","I got this set as a (rare) freebee with the LEGO Club Australia magazine. It is a pretty good looking snowman apart from the black, Star Wars droid arms which look a bit strange. It also comes with some&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;pieces. This set was quick to build and offers really no playability. I would have really enjoyed this set if it came with a minifig.",FALSE,4,4,3,1,5
"AETerry","2012-01-04T13:05:36.263Z","Snowman Review","<p>Alright, so this came out originally in 2009. There must have been a bunch of extras still as I picked this set up close to Christmas time in 2011. For a polybag set, the price of about $3.49 isn't too bad.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This set comes in a polybag with a set of folded instructions. Like all of LEGO's instructions, the pictures are clearly illustrated for each step of the build and easy to follow.<br></p>
<h4>Parts and Build<br></h4>There's a wide variety and assortment of pieces for making the snowman build. You could almost make him from your own collection of pieces if you had enough parts to work with.<br><br>The snowman is far more elaborate and detailed than an earlier set from the late 80's that I got. The final piece for the snowman's hat with that loop piece clearly shows you can put a hook or string on it to make an ornament.<br><br>The use of the skeleton or robot arms for the snowman seem a bit odd, but it works for creating the stick arms. The coal eyes of the snowman make him look a bit sinister or scary looking. Like it's glaring at people.<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>This wasn't too bad of a set, the pricing makes it possible to be an impulse buy and it made for a good stocking stuffer later turned tree ornament. It will go with the rest of Winter themed LEGO sets that I pull out for Christmas decorations in future years.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,5
"scubagirl","2012-01-14T11:50:17.9Z","Nicely made","<p>Pros: I think this snowman is adorable. Very easy to put together. I use him as a fan pull for my outdoor ceiling fan (on my porch)&nbsp;at Christmas time.</p>

<p>Cons: There isn't any because it only cost $3.00</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"StarKiller22515","2020-04-14T18:30:41.7Z","Great for a Christmas/Winter Display","<p>This is a nice set to have for display in a Christmas or Winter themed shelf or space. It&#39;s not that big and would be a great addition to a desk in the spirit of the wintery season.</p>
