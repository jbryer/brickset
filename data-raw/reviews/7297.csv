I chose the tree.<br><br>The build is very straightforward - there are no advanced construction methods and you'll breeze right through it. It may be worth noting that the configuration of presents under the three on the packaging is different than their arrangement in the instructions.<br><br>The design, I feel, is solid enough in a ""this is clearly a LEGO model"" sense, but there are a couple small qualms I have with the design. First, the gray rotor pieces that hold the branches in place are clearly visible from just about any angle. Had these been provided in green or brown, it wouldn't be an issue. Second, the ornaments are resting on top of the tree's branches rather than hanging beneath them. They're certainly more visible this way, but it doesn't make a lot of sense. Luckily, this is LEGO we're talking about here, so this is pretty easily remedied.<br><br>The parts selection is nice here. Aside from the technic axle and gray rotors, it's a nice pile of basic bricks, slopes, and 1 x 1 round plates, generously provided in red, pearl gold, and metallic silver! There are even extra pieces in these colors provided. The set has a P/P ratio that's better than 10 cents per piece, so no complaints there. The colors of the presents at the base are very nice, too! Rather than stick entirely with the traditional LEGO primary colors, they throw us medium blue and orange presents as well.<br><br>Let's be honest, there's not much playability going on here. It's got no features and no minifigs, and it's really not to 'fig scale unless you're using it in a town center. I'm positive that's not why you're buying this set, though, so I wouldn't let it stop me if I were you! <br><br>All in all, it's a lovely little seasonal set with just a couple annoying design decisions. It would look great on anybody's desk during the holidays and is a surprisingly good value as far as impulse sets go.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,2,4

If you need a little desk topper or to liven up a shelf, this set is for you. My dad keeps it on his desk at school as a teacher. For even more fun, put&nbsp;a spinny piece on the bottom of the tree so that it can spin...anyway,&nbsp;if you see this set anywhere, get it, you won't regret it. </p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T17:45:25.96Z","Happy Holidays","<p>Set #30009 Christmas Tree: I picked this up on Sale in January of this year from TRU, they had an overabundance of this and the Snowman polybagged sets. But for 2$ and change I could see myself getting it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as Seasonal Sets go there isn't much to this little piece, basically you're building up a Christmas Tree complete with presents underneath, it uses few pieces and isn't precisely scaled for Mini-Figure use, but that isn't why I bought it. I honestly just liked the look of this set. I'm not sure if I can explain why, but I am certain that it will always have a space in my LEGO Collection Display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a bonus it livens up any Christmas Scene you wish to make for the holidays. So I say if you're looking for another LEGO Christmas Tree to add to your holiday display, then you can't go wrong with this little set. True there isn't a whole lot you can do with it, but it's special all on its own.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,2,4

"vikings","2020-06-14T20:58:46.84Z","Simple, Yet Nice. ","<p><strong>Box/Instruction:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a polybag. You don&#39;t get the normal polybag instructions with this set. You get a larger set of instructions than usual for a polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a couple nice parts in this set. The clear diamond and the 4x4 white round plate, and the 1x1 light blue brick. The different color bricks under the tree as well as the orange and red studs add some nice color to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice Christmas tree. The different colors really add to the set as a whole. The clear diamond is really cool and works nicely as the star on top of the tree. I do wish they choose colors other than orange and grey on the tree branches as they aren&#39;t really Christmas colors. The different color bricks under the tree look amazing as presents. I recommend this set to any holiday collector. Even if you aren&#39;t, this set will still look great in your Lego collection (especially around Christmas). Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
