Building this was really easy. Instructions were simple and clear. Took about an hour with breaks taking photos.
The set is pretty funky to build, it kind of reminded me of the Titanic as I was building it from the base up.

The plane, once built, measures approx 37cms long and 38 cm wide (depending on the end wings), and 14cm high.

I really liked the interior of the plane as the windows used 20 clear pieces for ten windows.
The two engines were interesting too as it uses some Technic bits. Wheels all move as does the towing car.

3 minifigs are present. One of them had a suitcase which was able to be opened.

The towing car reminded me of some of the older mini car sets I used to play with.

Pros: Easy to build, moveable. Towing car is cool. Price is CHEAP for the size!

Cons: Wish it made noises and had more moving parts, but I guess that's more to do with Technics.

A great set for any plane airport collection.

"campfire01","2010-01-27T21:18:46.64Z","Better than 7893 and 7894","Lego has finally released a 2x4 flat tile that goes on the roof of this plane.
Inside it is single file, with no ""doorway"" to the cockpit. That said, it is better than the planes in 7893 and 7894, because there are more bricks. 

The fact that it comes with a radar is helpful to anyone who has an Airport. It's not much really but it looks cool on a runway and adds to the authenticity. The minifigs are good but nothing new: an airport worker of sorts, a passenger and a pilot. It is more like a Lear or private jet than a passenger plane, but you could modify it. 

The truck is good, it comes with two seats, but is once again nothing special. The size scale is good and the wings are great because they aren't pre-made.

I got this for NZD 70, which is a bit steep considering that the last one was $80 and bigger. If you can get this on special, great.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It is more of a business/private jet then an airliner. The colors are subtle and realistic. The cockpit is nice since it has painted tiles and a slope surrounding three sides of the pilot. The nose piece and tail piece are large molded parts that are pretty normal for today's sets. They give the aircraft a real aerodynamic look.<div><div><br></div><div>The car and the tower are mediocre and don't add much to the set. I suppose they add some playability, however.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this is a very cool jet to add to your airport or whatever other aircraft you have.

"coldcomfort","2011-01-04T00:22:56.467Z","3181 Passenger Plane - Worth owning, but it won't be your favorite.","<p>&nbsp; This is the first set that I bought when I decided to get back into Lego building. I likely would have bought one of several other sets (such as the 7641 City Corner), but the selection at my local retailers was poor. This appeared to be a promising set and the only one in the price range I wanted to start with, so I pulled the trigger.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>At just under 13 cents American per piece, I feel that this set was priced reasonably.</li><li>There are several interesting elements included in this set that lend themselves well to other imaginative building projects.</li><li>The build turned out to be quite substantial. The plane is very solid and while my models don't see any ""play"" in the traditional sense, I see no reason that it wouldn't wear well in the hands of reasonably reserved children. The tow vehicle, in the tradition of small Lego cars, is an absolute brick. <br></li></ul><br>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>So many seats in the plane, but just one passenger.</li><li>While the outward appearance of the plane is quite detailed and realistic, the interior represents an unfortunate missed opportunity. A single row of seats without even room to pass them isn't even close to what I would have liked to see.</li><li>In order for this set to be truly superlative, it would need to be two seats wide throughout and include at least three more minifigures (specifically I would like to see a co-pilot, a flight attendant and either one more passenger or another member of the support crew).<br></li></ul><br>
<p>&nbsp; I'm glad I own this set and I had a good time building it. Unlike some others I did not find the build to be too repetitive and I didn't get bored or lose interest at any time during the hour and a half I spent building it (I like to be meticulous with the decals). If you enjoy the airport/aeronautics aspect of the City theme, you will certainly like this set. It will look great sitting on the tarmac when I get the airport.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"av8r1973","2011-01-03T09:04:14.55Z","Nice second plane for the airport","As the review title suggests, this jet isn't much good unless you actually have an airport (I am waiting for the airport to go on sale in Taiwan before I can buy it). As other reviews mention, there aren't any stairs, no evident way for people to get in and out of the plane and really nowhere for them to go.<div><br>With that said, the set is still very nice. &nbsp;It's not as big as the jet that comes with the airport set, but is more like one of the regional airliners (I think the interior is actually bigger than some I have flown on). &nbsp;Pretty standard build, but I wish the wheels retracted. &nbsp;Even my little Creator set has retractable gear. &nbsp;It would have added some realism and there is definitely room for them in the center of the plane. &nbsp;At least they are tandem tires like the real ones.</div><div><br></div><div>Perhaps the best part of the kit is the realistic tow bar and approach control radar. &nbsp;The radar set is a great addition to the airport set (or it will be, in my case). &nbsp;It's sturdy and has a great way to secure the base. &nbsp;I will be implementing that on my City Garage communications antenna soon. &nbsp;The tow bar for the tug is almost a perfect model of the real thing. &nbsp;Well done! &nbsp;The tug is more like one of those electric airport passenger shuttle than a real tug. &nbsp;I think I will need to construct my own heavy-duty tug like the real airports have.</div><div><br></div><div>One minor gripe is the roof section. &nbsp;It's rather clumsy to get the top of the plane off to cram passengers inside. &nbsp;I need to put my fingernail under the roofline to pry it up. &nbsp;Perhaps two less lugs per section would make it easier to lift off - like the City Train.</div><div><br></div><div>My 3 and 5yo daughters put it together with help on the instructions and they both love playing with it. &nbsp;I recommend this kit if you have, or are planning to get, the airport.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4

only 3 relatively current airplanes I can think of, the seaplane, the 
one in the airport and this one. I know a lot of folks think the airport one is a let-down with its pre-molded wing.</p><p>At 309 parts (+ the 4 spares) it's a fairly small set. The 3 minifigures are nothing out of the ordinary - a passenger, a pilot and a worker who, for me anyway stands out since he has a 'wooly' hat instead of the normal hard helmet or cap type hats that usually come with these types of figures.</p><p>The box comes with 4 bags, 2 books and a sheet of stickers - thankfully not too many. 3 bags are for the plane itself along with the larger book, about 60 pages including all the filler pages and the other bag and book is for the tow vehicle and radar tower.</p><p>The vehicle is quite nice and I particularly like the design of the towing bar, my only grumble is you have to lift the airplane to hook it up. The car can seat 2 people and if you put the passenger on it, there's nowhere to put the suitcase that comes with him but it's a minor point.</p><p>The radar tower is simpe taking just 6 pages of instructions to cover its assembly. In spite of its simplicity it is quite effective and stands about 15cm tall (6""). The main part of the tower is a pre-molded part taking up about 11cm of the height but I think this is more effective than what could have been done with blocks.<br></p><p>The aircraft itself is quite nice. It's roughy 35cm (14"") long and has a wingspan of about 33cm (13"") and stands about 14cm high (5.5"") There are a few flaws such a lack of a door, minifig accessories and the wing tips are easy to knock off. the front and back are largely pre-molded pieces and the cockpit is removed to put the pilot in and out. The roof along the length of the aircraft can also be removed to put passengers in the plane which seats 6 + the pilot. The wings are made up from various plates which means storing the model disassembled is easier than the airplane in 3182 Airport.<br></p>Overall build time is probably about 30 minutes for an adult, probably a lot longer for a kid with the windows being fiddly and the engines as well.<br><br>Playability on its own is probably quite limited but combined with the airport and additional minifigures it would be quite fun.<br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Airplane is a mostly good design<br></li><li>Worker minifigure</li><li>Towbar on vehicle is a nice design<br></li><li>Minimal sticker use<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The wing tips are flimsy<br></li><li>More minifigures please<br></li><li>The radar tower while quite good is pointless if you have the airport</li><li>Airplane is a little narrow - no aisle space</li><li>Only a briefcase for passenger. Some mugs or goblets for passengers would be good.<br></li></ul>
<p>Don't let the negatives deter you. It's a mostly good model, if overpriced, and is a nice addition to the airport. The radar could be left out and more minifigures in its place would make for a better set. The vehicle while functional is fairly basic and could be improved upon although its towbar is very nice.</p><p><br></p><p>Final advice: wait for a sale and get it then but do get it if you wish to add to the airport.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,3

"deelio777","2011-07-04T02:30:39.25Z","Realistic jet perfect for any lego airport!","I for one actually really, really liked this set, particularly because of the realistic details of the plane and its overall look and design. Like any other Lego City set (specifically ""airport"" or ""transportation""), this set's build is very straight forward and it comes with three minifigs (pilot, passenger, and maintenance worker), an airplane ""tow"" vehicle, a small radar tower, and, of course, THE AIRPLANE! I like the plane's blue/white color scheme and how realistic the wings and jet engines look. The landing gear is very nice and I like how Lego inserted the hinged wing tips for a more realistic look. The exterior is great, but the interior lacks a lot of important components that takes away from the realism of the jet. Even though it's a smaller plane, there are no aisles (i.e. only one row of seats and most planes have at least two rows and one aisle). There's room for only one pilot in the cockpit which, even though it's not very realistic, it isn't much of a problem for me because Lego planes I've gotten and built myself in the past have usually had room for only one pilot. The back of the plane features a nice hollow area to store luggage and the tail is amazing on this airplane because of its sturdiness and beauty. The fuselage is well-designed, though there aren't any doors, and I've become a big fan of the doors on the other airplanes Lego has released in the past few years that actually have realistic doors. Overall, this set is really great because it sells at a pretty fair price ($40), comes with a detailed plane, three minifigs that are good to have for any Lego airport, a radar tower which, when inserted in a Lego airport, adds cool detail, and an exclusive vehicle to ""tow"" the plane onto the runway from the terminal.

"craigpowers","2012-07-28T23:16:53.12Z","A Nice Regional Jet with Bonus Tug and Radar - Perfect for a Lego Airport","<p>I love everything about airplanes, and I have always loved the Lego airport sets. &nbsp;But when it comes to set #3181, my love is not as centrally focused on the plane alone, as it is many of my other sets, but rather on the detailed, additional accessories in the form of a radar tower and an aircraft tug; both of which are of exceptional value to an airport nut, such as myself, and lend to a higher level of playability.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-Very strong set design overall. &nbsp;The plane has good dimensions, balance and color scheme. &nbsp;The radar is a simple, but nicely constructed piece and an essential to any airfield. &nbsp;The tug is decent, but the tow bar is a fantastic accessory.</li><li>-Compatibility. &nbsp;The radar is a universal accessory that can be placed among many other airport-themed sets and it compliments them all very well. &nbsp;The tug and tow bar are especially handy for compiling a busy airport scenario. &nbsp;The tug is capable of not only ""hitching"" to this jet, but it also fits the helicopter from set #<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=3222-1"">3222</a>, and, with some modification to the front landing gear arrangement, will also hitch to the helicopter from set #<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7738-1"">7738</a>.</li><li>-Size. &nbsp;Although there are many who argue that this airplane lacks the refinement of its larger brethren (aisle between seats, bathroom), I feel that the aircraft is a nice ""medium sized"" airplane. &nbsp;Not all commercial liners are jumbos, and the regional airline business has soared as of late, giving rise to fleets of E-145s and CRJs, and this set serves as a model of these carriers. &nbsp;Plus, it sits right between the large, commercial jets, and small, private aircraft, giving your airport some diversity.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Price. &nbsp;Very rarely do I complain about the cost of a Lego set, especially anything airport-related, which is my favorite theme. &nbsp;But I felt that Lego may have reached a little on their asking price, given that there are only 3 minifigures to a set that should have at least 4. &nbsp;The lone passenger looks so pathetic sitting in the airplane all by himself.</li><li>-Odd-colored bricks. &nbsp;I get that Lego has, for the sake of simplifying building certain sets, added brightly colored pieces in order to distinguish them while going through the assembly steps. &nbsp;Usually, they end up in places where they are completely obscured and not at all an impact on the overall aesthetic. &nbsp;Yet, with this set, there are bright red pieces placed on the very edges of the wings on the bottom that are glaringly obvious. &nbsp;Why Lego? &nbsp;Why can't these be gray or some other subdued color? &nbsp;As it is, it makes it look like these were put on as ""replacement, wrong-color"" parts to take place of what would have been gray pieces. &nbsp;Fortunately, they are in a place where they can be easily exchanged, but why must I even have to do this?</li></ul>
<p>I am overall very pleased with this purchase. &nbsp;The airplane is the definite highlight of this set, but the accompanying tug and radar are such exceptional pieces based on their functionality that they more than make up for any shortcomings the aircraft, itself, may have. &nbsp;If you have other aircraft already, this one will probably not top your list as a favorite, nor will it steal the spotlight from any collection, but it is almost an essential purchase, if just for the radar and the tug.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4

<p>I think overall, that this plane is quite good, although it could be wider for more seats.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"legoghostbusters","2015-12-13T03:00:26.19Z","Great But...","<p>Starting off I&#39;m a huge fan of the LEGO aviation world. I buy all the aviation related LEGO I&nbsp;can.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box and instructions&nbsp;are&nbsp;the usual city ones nothing exciting here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The part selection is GREAT! The small plane along side the larger plane&nbsp;(3182) looks so cool, I love how LEGO completely changed the build for &quot;just another plane&quot;. Sadly no specially printed pieces&nbsp;:( just a whole lot of stickers.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Passenger and the pilot aren&#39;t exciting, the pilots the usual and the passenger has nothing special about him. What I love about this set though is the ground worker, LEGO never really had to include him but yet they did. Which I love! Sadly this set doesn&#39;t come with a flight attendant.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very easy and straightforward. I&#39;ve already broken it and didn&#39;t have to use instructions to put it back together. The actual interior is kind of sad. There is no door to exit/enter the jet and there is no ailse&nbsp;for the pilot or flight attendants. Also there is no &quot;door&quot; between the pilot and passengers.Even worse where is the toilet?</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great exterior look. Sadly I can&#39;t fit woman with their hair onboard this jet. Which is a big letdown. Engines and wings give it that &quot;private jet look&quot; which actually I don&#39;t think LEGO should have gone, I would rather have wing-side engines.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great &quot;cheap&quot; set for aviation fans. Lacks in good interior though. The roof parts need to be looked at again and improved. Wish it came with a aisle and toilet. Too many stickers for a set with this playability, needs to be all printed.&nbsp;Overall I rate this set a 4/5.</p>
