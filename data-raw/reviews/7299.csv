"mortallum","2010-01-08T00:28:43.983Z","Epic build!  A truly masterful set.","It's hard to describe how simply spectacular this set is.  The forced perspective in the stock shots from our friends in Denmark do not do it justice.  If this is the swan song of the current Pirates run, it has certainly ended on a high note.

The construction is extremely straightforward.  Simple steps, logical piece pairings.  But with the culmination of each sub-assembly you will be amazed at how much you have built.  To be honest there are no new techniques here...with the exception of the sails themselves.  Anyone who has bristled at the ""knoby"" attachment of previous paper windcatchers will be quite impressed with the solidity and simplicity of the Flagship's canvas attachment mechanisms.

Another winning point for 10210 has to be the sheer spaciousness of the vessel.  Where before our minifigs where sandwiched between the one row of studs afforded their lookouts, this ship provides an amazing depth of room and space for our scurvy-ridden troops.

Pros:
It is bigger than you could imagine for the piece count.
Finally, LG has figured out how to adequately mount sails!


Cons:  
Your upstairs neighbors will complain as the masts scrape your ceiling.

Overall:  Simply one of the best boxes available.   It warrants building an armada of these ships.

"sudorum","2010-01-15T17:28:09.56Z","Without a Doubt the Best PIRATE SHIP!","This ship's supremacy is equal to none. It is truly unlike any other pirate ship before it. The level of detail is simply astonishing. The ship is made up of a top and lower section. The top half has three massive flag posts which are nearly as tall as the ship is long. Also on the top is the captain's cabin and wheel. The cabin's interior contains a treasure chest, a newly designed map, a telescope stand, and a blue diamond in a cone, which is supposed to be a poison bottle. It even has an organ, which looks great. You can lower the anchor by turning a spoked wheel on top. To access the lower section, you can remove the two top halves or lift up two gray square floor pieces. The lower half has four cannons, two white crates full of ammo, and a kitchen and dungeon. The dungeon is below the cabin and has a door, bench, and rat. The kitchen is possibly the best. It has a midget cook, fish, turkey legs, a carrot, and pots and pans hanging up. Though this set is unfortunately high priced, in  the end its simply a marvel to look at or play with. ",FALSE,5,5,5,5,4

"Zuma","2010-01-25T05:09:56.17Z","An epic ship","Once you have built this set, you realise that the pictures do not do it justice, or highlight its amazing details. 

It is much bigger than 6243 (Blackbeard's Bounty), the previous Imperial ships have been rather puny in comparison to the pirate ships, so it is nice to have this swapped! 

I think the colour scheme works well,  tan and light blue, and the dark brown bricks are teak-like in colour to add to the realistic look of it. 

Below the top deck the kitchen has some amazing details - fish, meat roasting, carrots, pots and chopping knifes. The prison is a good size and design, and is above the anchor raising wheel - a good feature. 

The captains quarters above the kitchen - the pipe organ is a great design, telescope and stand (but could have been on the captains deck) and the poison bottle could also be a rum bottle, it all adds to the great feel of the ship. 

The captains deck on top is rather empty of detail, with just the wheel - some gun ports or more details would have been nice - perhaps a mini-cannon. It kind of looks like it was the last bit to be designed and was a bit over-looked... 

The masts - look better in brown than in black, but I find them too wobbly, too much movement in them, and the rigging fastenings (exo-force hooks?) onto the ship look out of character - normal clips would have looked better. The sail fittings are good and an improvement on previous ones as they allow more sail adjustment.

The fore sail connection is a little tap, and two lances - a novel idea, but not that sturdy as compared to previous pirate or imperial ships. 

The top-deck has good clean design and colour scheme to make the most of the space. Great to see the cannons below deck where they would have been.

Things I think it could have done with:-
Crows nest on the main mast
Crane for hoisting treasure/cargo aboard
Little row boat
More imperials 
More cannons - four below the top deck seems insufficient
More spare weapons - only two rifles. Would have been nice feature to have some more - perhaps on the captains deck or the front... 

If you have a pirate tic-tac-toe (or can get hold of one cheaply), it has four imperials that you can add to the ship. But I now have ten imperials on it, and this still looks not enough for the size of the ship - due partly to clean design of the top deck. 

Once it is built, it looks great, and with a few modifications and extra imperials, even better. 

Overall, it has a rather hefty price-tag, but does it justify it... 

If you compare it to previous pirate ships - 6285, 6286 & 6289 - it does hold it own with regards to the size, details, design and colour scheme. It is far larger than any previous imperial and the amarda ship, with some great small details. I feel that it will become highly sort-after due to its appeal and some neat features. However, for the price, I feel that it could have been slightly better - a few little extra things and it would have been perfect! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"no_skill","2010-01-15T20:46:02.373Z","Don't Pass On This One!","This is a fantastic set!  In almost every way, the model is better in person than I expected from pictures and box art.

From pictures, I was skeptical of the aesthetics of the prow SNOT.  In person, it works wonderfully, however.  Elsewhere people have commented on the prow being flimsy.  While not robust, I have found it sufficiently sturdy and have yet to experience any unexpected detachments.  

The build starts a little mundane.  Once the center hull is attached to the aft galley and fo’c’sle brig, the ship starts to take shape and the build is riveting to the end!

I had doubts about the color scheme (mostly with the blue accents), but again it looks great in person.  I am a big fan of the soft tubing on the prow.  The slightly different bend of the upper and lower prow “rigging” is well executed.  If this area were filled in with bricks, the forecastle would look overly bulky.

A single tap on the bowsprit provides a forestay.  To my surprise, it holds the jib much better than expected.  Who would have thought?  Lances are used to create a masthead for the jib…it functions well, but doesn’t look quite right to me.  It’s a petty complaint, really.

My other petty complaint is using single 2 x 1 slopes to cap off the inverted arches that swing up to the poop deck.  It looks a little unfinished.  I will mod this as soon as I am done drooling over the majesty of this gargantuan vessel (which may take a while).  Oh, and a ship this size may be slightly undermanned by the crew provided…a few cannon battles will solve that dilemma!

This is a must have set, even though it’s a shock to the pocket book.  We all know this is one of those instantly classic sets that those who pass on will regret later.  (Who needs another one of those in their brain’s inventory?!)

"mjackson4100","2010-02-05T22:51:05.483Z","Excellent Ship","All I can say is that it is about time the imperials have a ship that can match up to the pirates. The previous ""flagship"" was so tiny it didn't deserve to even be called such. This is not the case with this ship. It literally is MASSIVE. It is just about 2 feet tall and is 30 inches long from tip of bow to stern. It provides plenty of room for treasures and gear, with a full below deck and upper deck. 

The detail on the ship is very impressive. You find great detail from the pipe organ and desk with drawers in the admirals quarters to the detail put into the kitchen below. 

A few CONS to this ship:
1. Only four cannons while there are ports for 8 total (4 per side)
2. No row boat (what's up with that? every big ship needs a little boat for venturing to shore in search of jewels)
3. Not enough soldiers (there seriously needs to be like 15 soliders to sail this ship)
4. Some areas of the construction seem poorly designed and flimsy
5. Chain on anchor should be a tad longer

A few PROS
1. Awesome detail
2. Very impressive front end with the swordfish
3. MASSIVE size (watchout Redbeard & Brickbeard)
4. Sections very easily remove for access to under decks and quarters
5. Building this set is super fun. Me and the wife did this is about 3 or 4 hours.

I give the ship a 4. It is DEFINETLY worth the money and is for sure going to be a classic someday. Don't loose the opportunuty to buy this set before it's gone. You'll regret it just like the people who didn't get the Black Seas Barracuda. It's a little pricy but if you have the cash, do it. If you want it make sure you buy from LEGO's website. eBay people are trying to sell this set for anywhere between 250 and 450 bucks plus shipping.  It's 179.99 US on their website.

"lotographia","2010-02-10T05:47:11.543Z","Flawed, but perfect.","Yes, this ship has flaws... but every Lego set has flaws and compromises, sometimes you have to rate things as 'best that can be done in an imperfect world'.

It's best not to think about what this ship is lacking, and think about what the ship DOES have. It has a detailed kitchen and cabin, a prison cell, a proper deck, an anchor and many small details that were lacking in Brickbeard's Bounty, for example a sextant and cannon plungers. It has realistic sails rather than juniorised ones. The upper deck actually has proper access. There are quite a few interesting building techniques, like the curved panels at the front of the ship.

<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Pros: </span><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Like all other reviews, I must reiterate that this set is huge. The building experience is thoroughly enjoyable especially with the modular style that the designers came up with, enhancing it's playability factor and yet maintaining a certain extent of realism. I was initially surprised to compare and realise that the brown used for much of the hull was darker that brickbeard's bounty, but the colour combination of sandy white and baby blue really comes off very well. It truly is the best official lego pirate ship released with such exquisite details that adorn it. I'm relatively pleased with the number and variety of minifigs that come along with the set. <br />
<br />
Cons: Perhaps some minor improvements could be made in terms of strengthening the 3 masts as I found them a tad bit wobbly perhaps due to its height and size.<br />
It also came to my mind that strings (ropes) could be used to link the masts and the main hull as a solution to the slight wobbling of the masts as well as to further improve on its authentic look that most sail ships have. <br />
<br />
However, despite the minor improvements that could be worked on, all in all, this is one set not to be missed for ALL Lego fans and fans of ships too. Though it's a little pricey in my country, I still find it definitely worth the money if you have some to spare. This is one set that will surely have my eyes glued on it for some time. <br />

"ritchiejt","2022-12-01T07:34:21.107Z","Finer details","<p>There is no other ship like it so you can justify the cost.&nbsp; It is the best of the Lego line.&nbsp; I&#39;ve read the other reviews so I only wanted to write to discuss some finer details.</p>

<p>As an owner of the Black Seas Barracuda (BSB), the Skull&#39;s Eye Schooner (SES), the first Imperial Flagship, Brickbeard&#39;s Bounty, Captain Redbeard&#39;s Pirate Ship (that has been heavily modified), two Renegade Runners and now the new Imperial Flagship, I&#39;ve seen a lot of the good (and not so good)&nbsp;things that the Lego Pirate genre produced.</p>

<p>First is the issue of sleeping/sitting.&nbsp; This ship is large enough to support extras like beds/chairs but none were designed except for the bench in the prison.&nbsp; It does not make sense that the only comfort in the ship would be for the prisoner to lie down and the Captain to sit down to play the organ.&nbsp; So I turned the prison to a bunk house and also put a bed and chair in the Captain&#39;s chamber and some chairs in the lower part of the ship.</p>

<p>Weapon/Backback storage.&nbsp; It is true that the ship comes with a skeleton crew, but I added a few more but then needed more room for storage of weapons and backpacks.&nbsp; Use your imagination to find ways to store these items.</p>

<p>While not as bad as the green cannon porthole covers on the SES, the blue covers looked odd when folded down so I replaced them with black so that it looks more flush with the rows of black columns.</p>

<p>While it has so many additional features as compared to the BSB and the SES, it is not as sturdy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Playability is affected by the front of the ship falling off when gently nudged.&nbsp; Be aware that this ship is more for show than for play, but the price tag should be your first clue.</p>

"ClassicLegosAreBetter","2010-08-28T18:00:51.747Z","Looks more like a wooden model than a clssic Lego Toy in my opinion","This is a masterpiece as far as display is concerned, but when it comes to playability it falls short. It seems much too big and cumbersome to really play with it. The Skull's Eye Schooner was big and it had that distinct ""lego"" look, this just does not to me. Maybe if the sails were not such a bland white/brownish color. That's the color you see on wooden model ships not lego ships. Lego ships have black and white stripes or red or blue with cool designs, not plain brown and white with no designs. This set gets a 4 from me, because when I look at it it doesn't give off that true classic ""Lego Toy Ship"" vibe, but maybe that is just me. Again it's just my opinion.<br>",TRUE,2,3,3,2,3
"InfiniteEin","2011-09-26T19:46:58.913Z","Best Lego Ship Ever","<p>This was the first set I've bought in 10 years and I have to say, for my reintroduction to Lego, this was an excellent experience.&nbsp; This is the first Lego pirate ship that actually looks like a real ship instead of the standard bucket style with no deck that Lego likes to produce.</p><p>The build is easy and straightforward except for the bags that weren't labeled.&nbsp; And since I had been away from Lego for too long, I didn't organize the pieces and this thing literally took me forever to put together.&nbsp; Which I didn't mind of course.&nbsp; But searching for pieces in the massive pile I created extended my building experience to about 11 hours. After I finished building it, I was pretty amazed with this ship.&nbsp; It's giant and looks solid.&nbsp; I didn't have any problems with the front falling off and still haven't even after bumping into it a few times while its on display</p><p>I know other ships have included the smaller life boats so I was surprised the biggest ship didn't include them.&nbsp; Since I thought the ship needed them, I added two life boats to the front of the ship that lean up against the front mast on either side. It looks pretty cool.&nbsp; After that, I looked at other little improvements I could make and ended up adding a few things.&nbsp; A crows next on the tallest mast, extra studs to the sides on a couple spots that needed them, a railing on the front of the top deck of the ship so my poor Lego figures don't fall off and hurt themselves, and most importantly bricks that sit behind the cannons.&nbsp; Since the cannons are on wheels, whenever you move the ship, the cannons go flying all over the place below deck and you have to remove the two top removable sections to fix them every time.&nbsp; Four 2x2 bricks fixed that. And I added a ladder to one of those bricks so the figs had access to the lower deck without having to jump, again for safety purposes.</p><p>But enough about Lego safety.&nbsp;&nbsp; Excellent ship, I'm very happy with this one.&nbsp; I hope they build a Pirate ship that rivals this Imperial ship, with just as many details and piratey goodness. The Queen Anne's revenge just doesn't cut it. (Which I own, not so Impressed). Oh and I don't think I'll ever give Lego 5 bricks for price.&nbsp; Lego have always been overpriced.

"naf","2013-07-19T01:24:28.41Z","An epic ship that rivals any vessel Lego has produced so far.","<p>Wow, what a ship.&nbsp; This is the set that got me out of my dark ages.&nbsp; I got back into Lego right when this ship was retiring, and had to pay a bit of an after market markup to get it.&nbsp; It was still worth it.&nbsp; Pictures can't do this set justice, built model is just beautiful.&nbsp; The details are great, especially the fully stocked galley and captain's quarters.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of nice little details: nice shark figurehead; galley with cook, turkey spit, fish, pots, pans, etc; great captain's quarters with organ, map, and rum.<br></li><li>Two decks!&nbsp; Gun deck, galley, and brig below, top deck and captain's quarters above.&nbsp; Most historically accurate ship from Lego.</li><li>3 Masts and 7 sails really fill out the ship and make it look substantial.</li><li>Great color scheme.&nbsp; The browns, tans, and blues look really sharp.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Could have used some more details on the top deck and bridge area, looks kind of bare even with the minifigures.<br></li><li>Could have used a few more minifigures to flesh out the crew.&nbsp; Maybe a few sailors along with the soldiers.<br></li><li>While the sails are fabric, they feel paper-like and I'm afraid they might rip if handled roughly. The sails on my Black Seas Barracuda feel a bit sturdier.&nbsp; However, the Imperial Flagship sails hold their shape better when mounted on the masts.</li><li>Price.&nbsp; I feel like this set is priced higher than other sets with similar price counts (I'm comparing MSRP, I paid more since I bought it after it retired).</li><li>Color reproduction in the instructions is poor.&nbsp; All of the illustrations are really dark, dark brown blacks and dark blues run together, and gold looks like orange.&nbsp; It can trip you up if you're not paying careful attention to each step.<br></li></ul>
<p>In the end, I'm so glad I was able to get this ship.&nbsp; While Lego is a children's toy, this ship is for the adults.&nbsp; The masts and front end can come apart if played with in a rough manner.&nbsp; This ship is best displayed on a shelf or mantle and is not really a playset.&nbsp; The build will also be a challenge for younger children.&nbsp; Go ahead AFOLs, indulge yourself and add this beauty to your collection.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"VanhaPalikka","2023-04-12T07:27:28.42Z","The absolutely majestic piece of Lego history","<p>If I had to name one set to perfectly represent the whole pirates line-up it would obviously be this set. I think no set can ever come even close to the sheer amount of accurate&nbsp;details in this set. I mean there is the rehashed <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21322-1/Pirates-of-Barracuda-Bay"">Black Seas Barracuda</a>&nbsp;some might argue that that set portrays a much more accurate portrayal&nbsp;of a pirate-era vessel, but I disagree because though it has majestic outside details, it is missing liftable deck covers and the interior design though cool but not accurate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building experience on this set was something I thoroughly enjoyed some might say that the simplicity&nbsp;of&nbsp;the sets parts make the building experience dull. But I think the simplicity of the parts portray the core idea of Lego. Meaning that this set displays how accurate models you can make with basic parts. There are a few building techniques I&#39;d like to point out. Firstly there is the chopped carrot in the&nbsp;galley which blew me away with its simplicity. Also, I really loved how the designer had decided to design the black keys on the organ in my opinion that was really creative and really effective.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also really liked how the upper part of the bow was created that design was really affective as well. Something I don&#39;t really like about this set design wise is the figurehead&nbsp;I think that the use of a saw head shark was kind of lazy, I really think a better option would have been to try and build the figurehead out of bricks. But in the end we have to remember the limits of the time this set was released.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts wise there is very little to complain about I really like the choice to use plastic sails rather than cloth sails. Because I think the plastic sails hold their form much better than the cloth ones and I think this set really benefits from that.&nbsp; Although there is little to none to&nbsp;complain about the part choices there is a lot to complain about the quality of bricks at this time period. My&nbsp;recommendation is, if you have this set don&#39;t take it apart or if you do please handle with care. I take extra caution at least with the dark brown parts since those are the most brittle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay now I have to talk about the worst aspect of this set, the price tag. Although relatively cheap upon release thirteen years later there is nothing cheap about the price. Today you have little to no chance of finding this set under &euro;500 and that is ridiculous. But still in my opinion it is worth its high price tag, but I would think about it long and hard (that&#39;s what she said) before forking the high price tag.</p>
