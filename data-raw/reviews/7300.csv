"Loganwan","2010-01-25T00:33:54.14Z","The Quad, the Boat, and the Truck","This is a nice set, with one exception I will get to later with regards to the truck.

The quad is a really nice vehicle.  It is built completely out of pieces, which makes it better in my book than the older style trikes we used to get.  It looks like a nice pilot vehicle for the truck with the tall light. Also equipped with a hatchet and extinguisher, the fireman can get to work on the shore.

The boat is nice.  The twin engines are awesome.  They are well designed and look like they can really get that boat moving. The boat is equipped with two life jackets, and a powerful looking rotating water cannon.
There are two on-board computer systems that look good, and give something for the passenger to do.

The truck is beautiful and BIG!  It has room in the cab for two firemen to sit side by side, a standard for most of the big trucks that Lego has been putting out.
It has two long arms that swing out from the side for support.
Lights, lights, everywhere!  The front end looks mean with all of the extra spotlights in the center grille.

Now the problem with the truck.  It comes with a crane to get the boat on and off.  The crane works well, able to lift the boat up, swing to either side and it goes all the way to the ground.
The problem is that is comes off the rotating plate very easily. This is a bit of a problem as it kills the playability as you have to reattach the crane. With that, and the fact that the crane only extends a little brought my rating down a point.

This is a really nice vehicle, and with one problem, it is still worth the buy if you are a City fan, or Fire fan.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>Let's take a closer look at the truck.&nbsp; It is eight studs wide and quite long.&nbsp; There are four wheels on each side that can move up and down like a real suspension.&nbsp; There are stabalization legs but the ends have to be removed to fold the legs back up.&nbsp; There is also a handy crane for the boat but it falls of the turntable piece a lot when you rotate it.&nbsp; The crane also has no controls.</p>
<p>The boat: The boat is similar to its Coast Guard counterpart.&nbsp; It has twin motors on the back which can flip up when put on the trailer.&nbsp; It has a rotating water nozzle on the bow which is a nice feature.&nbsp; I don't understand the solid-colored windshield though.&nbsp; It also has two seats for minifigures and storage racks for life vests.</p>
<p>ATV: Similar to its Coast Guard counterpart also, except it has accessory storage.&nbsp; Nice to see it come with the set.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a fairly nice set.&nbsp; It has a few stickers but they have a larger size and are easy in some sense to place.&nbsp; I kind of wish it was a medium-sized truck with trailer instead of one whole, but it's awesome anyway.&nbsp; If you're a CITY fire fan, go ahead and buy it.&nbsp; It's a Target Limited Edition so what are you waiting for?&nbsp; I give it a 4 out of 5.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5

<p>It is a solid model, great for playability and durable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build takes time.&nbsp; It is highly detailed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would recommend this set, when on sale.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
"av8r1973","2011-01-05T09:30:54.783Z","Huge truck - cool features and parts","<p>This was on sale at the local Toyland in Taipei, so we picked it up for slightly less than US retail price.&nbsp; It was on the wish list, so...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three distinct components to this set, so it's a complete playset.</p>
<p><br/>First, the 4-wheeler.&nbsp; It's a great little brickbuilt unit with nice sized balloon tires, and some lights.&nbsp; It comes with a hatchet and a fire extinguisher, but the extinguisher is not secured well.&nbsp; I can't imagine it staying in place on a long ride (or being pushed by my daughter).&nbsp; I would have preferred red fenders to better set it apart from the police 4-wheeler, but there's a red brush bar in front that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ""inflatable"" boat is BIG.&nbsp; It's got two outboard motors, two seats, on-board computer systems (not sure exactly why, but they look cool), a wraparound windshield like a big speedboat really has and a rotating water cannon.&nbsp; The boat is actually bigger than my police helicopter, but the scale works pretty well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truck is the meat of the kit.&nbsp; It's HUGE!&nbsp; At 8 lugs wide, it's only matched by the construction set crane in my city.&nbsp; Even the big-rigs are only 6 lugs wide.&nbsp; This is significant because 2 minifigs can sit side by side in the cab.&nbsp; The articulating suspension is a nice mix of Technic elements - nice touch.&nbsp; It allows the truck to smoothly transition the obstacles in my living room (LEGO instructions, wrinkles in the carpet, and my daughter's fingers).&nbsp; The grille is menacing with all of the fog lights, but it lends to the off-road feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't used it much yet, but the crane appears stable.&nbsp; Other reviews mention weakness here, I hope not to experience it.&nbsp; The crane has an ingenious ""hydraulic"" look that does well at holding the crane's position.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the boat is heavier than the friction stop allows for.&nbsp; It's a simple fix using your hands to steady the crane, but...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last oddity, the outriggers are manually put together.&nbsp; The ""feet"" are stored on the truck platform and you have to assemble them to use them.&nbsp; An opening large enough to store the feet would have been nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the couple of detractors aren't worth keeping this monster out of my City.&nbsp; It doesn't go with the modular Fire Brigade set, but it will go fine with the fire station when I pick that up.&nbsp; It's a good set with some unique parts (boat windshield, crane boom, outriggers, etc...)</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
