"deadtree103","2009-12-29T00:28:18.013Z","Better than it looks.","Despite the bad reviews and the low Peice count, this is still an okay set. The Minifig is great, and he's new to me because he only comes with two other sets(Both of wich are kinda biggish). So it's great to get him in a small set. The rock doesn't really do much for the set, but it does have a new-style headlight brick in Dark Bley :D . And it's a really good army builder, and I'm planning on getting more so I can have a bunch of em swarming my Explorers :D . Oh yeah, and contrary to what most of the pictures make it look like, the head is mostly Light Bley, not white.

PROS :)
*Cheapest way to get the Manta Warrior.
*Headlight brick :D .
*Another trident(I LOVE that weapon).
*Another Dark Green Piraka spine.

CONS :(
*too small.
*Some pictures are misleading about the head color.

I reccomend it anyway.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"JBH75","2010-01-30T18:36:26.53Z","I got this on an Impulse...","Today, I went to Toys R Us to check if they finally gotten more merchandise after a Christmas sale, and I bought this set along with the Guardian of the Deep (so that I could give the red disk to a mini-fig). For an impulse set, I'd have to say that this set is average. I'll explain in the pros and cons

Pros:
Manta-man, with new body, and head
Flexible Trident
Nice little rock, with seaweed/Piraka Spine
Great army-builder
Cheapest way to get manta man

Cons:
Lack of pieces compared to other impulse sets
Lack of pieces = Overpriced!!
No disk (that doesn't really matter though)

In conclusion, if you want a cheap manta-man to build an army, or get lots of tridents, or seaweeds, buy this. Otherwise, buy the Seabed Scavenger for a Manta Man, as you'll receive more options, fairer price, but above all, a manta-man.

"ian","2010-08-16T12:24:14.777Z","attack of the freaky deranged manta warriors!","<p>This set is pretty decent, you get a freaky deranged manta warrior( since thats kind of annoying to type i'll call him steve) and a clump of seaweed attached to a rock. Steve is an excellently made minifig. He has tons of detail and his face even without his cool mask is downright creepy. Steve comes with gold trident and thats about it for Steve. The rock is kind of pitiful. I would have preferred a small creature or a treasure chest, but on the upside it does look nice. So get this set if you like awesome minifigures that give small children nightmares or are obsessed with dull scenery items.</p>

"Phantom","2010-10-21T16:12:18.4Z","There cant possibly be a dumber accsessory than a rock...","Obivously, the main attraction of this, lets say ""set"" is the Manta warrior, who, is quite a good figure by himself, hes got a hard-rubberish head, not like yoda, but also not like normal plastic heads, luckily, the printings dont peel off however. Overall, he's quite good.<br/><br/>Now onto the second part of the 'set', its a rock, a rock with some green sea weed, its described to 'hide the manta warrior and he will pop out to surprise a diver, if you have one'. REALLY NOW? I can spot a manta warrior behind the rock from a mile away-plain stupid if you ask me.<br/>Theres only one good part to this set, and thats the minifigure, my mom got this for me when she saw it at a shop, just as a little gift.",TRUE,3,1,1,2,4

So much to surprise, she got him for me for St. Nicholas Day (which we treat as an appetizer to Christmas). He's my only Atlantis set (I collect Star Wars Lego). Strangely enough, I love this guy!</p>
<p>Yes, objectively&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;a terrible set, but I am having a blast with him. His colors and look make him an awesome mascot for my favorite baseball team (the Tampa Bay Rays). He also looks great, especially scalewise, leading my Seacons (Transformers)--or at least trying too, lol. Plus, his rock and seaweed has the uncanny ability to make any toy I place next to it appear underwater.</p>

<p>I also bought two. I'd have liked it better if it were more cheaply 
priced, loose the rock and have just the figure. That's what I bought it
 for, the minifig so I could do army building with Atlantis. <br></p>
<p>Now, if they'd have more of the Shark Warriors in the sets.</p><p>Still, $4.99 isn't all that bad, it's comparable to the Collectible Minifigures line as there is an actual slight build to it.<br></p>

<h4>Parts</h4><p>You get 13 pieces in all for this set, most notable and best being the trident accessory and the green vine piece for kelp or seaweed.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get one minifigure, that of the Mantis Warrior.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>There really isn't much to this set, you get it mainly for the minifigure and just enough pieces to suggest and depict an underwater scene.",TRUE,3,2,2,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T12:22:00.663Z","A Manta Warrior stands alone.","<p>Set #8073 Manta Warrior: UGH, just... Ugh. This should have been one of the Collectible Mini-Figures, at least dollar value wise you'd be getting a better deal than this Impulse set. Why? Because it's only 13 pieces, but you're paying 5$ for it. Of course it is a decent little troop builder for your Atlantis theme, but only if you can get it on sale at 50% off or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the Impulse sets and will gladly keep buying every one of them no matter what, but I would have thought that this Manta Warrior could have at least been given something to interact with more than just a little underwater plant life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a proper comparison allow me to bring up another little set I once owned. It was from the Divers Sub-Theme and it included one mini-figure, a life raft/miniatrue motor boat, a sword-fish type shark, three jewels and an underwater plant and it cost about the same price as this embarrassment to the Impulse set theme. That set at least gave you your money's worth, LEGO should have included an Atlantis Key with this set and maybe given you something to build like a mini-sub or something. Anything would be better than this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still if you can pick this up on sale you won't hate it, you just won't love it too much, though the Manta Warrior is a pretty neat little Mini-Figure. Who am I kidding? At full price I'd probably still buy two or three of this set. But that's just me. And not all Impusle sets can be great.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,2,2

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure is awesome looking.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I didn&#39;t build this set because I can build one anyway with all the spare bricks I have. So I kept it in the box.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great except for the little pile of rocks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set, because you can add it with other Atlantis sets for more playability. I never opened it, and I only wanted it because it is the smallest set ever produced in a box(I think). Also, it is worth about $7 (USD) in the box. I recommend this set to everyone, except if you buy it, get another Atlantis set along with it. Overall I give this set a 2-3 out of five stars depending on how you use it.</p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2019-01-10T19:45:18.993Z","A Small Companion to the Larger Sets","<p>On it&#39;s own this set isn&#39;t the best. It consists of a Manta Warrior minifigure and a small rock clump with some seaweed. The set only consists of 13 pieces, almost none of which are even slightly rare. The figure itself is the only interesting part, and even it appears in many Atlantis sets and is fairly cheap. It also doesn&#39;t really provide much play value on it&#39;s own.</p>

<p>However, when paired with some of the larger sets it could make a nice space filler in a diorama or a small companion set for play. So it all depends on how you look at it. By itself it is not worth it, but paired up with some other sets it can add a little extra value. I hope you find this review helpful!</p>
