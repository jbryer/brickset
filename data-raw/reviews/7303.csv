The sub is not very impressive to look at but has nice weapons and guns, and another cool diver. The turtle is great, but LEGO gave me too many large white teeth and not enough small ones. He looks very large and powerful and has a neat turtle key to defend. 4/5.",FALSE,4,3,4,5,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first item built in this set is for the sub. From the side angles, it's a very good build. I just have problems with it when it's finished, looking at it straight on, wondering how on earth the Diver is supposed to see out given his obstructed view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shadow Snapper though, is a beauty of a beast to construct out of Lego and has you wondering at first how all the pieces are going to form together. The way the pieces snap on at the end to form his shell is awesome. There's very good articulation of the limbs both front and rear for it's claws. And the head, while a tad bulky works perfectly for a turtle's head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At $29.99 U.S., I could see arguments that this set is about $5 more then what it could be. When you compare it to the other sets in the series, it's just right and many of the other Atlantean sets for 2010 that feature a Sea Creature as the main build or name for the set and then an Atlantean Diver, usually feature the Diver on his own and with hardly anything worthy to defend himself with or to be able to get away safely.</p>

Regular price may seem high [although that seems a standard sentiment for these reviews], but on sale, it was perfect. The 'Combat Sub' isn't super-solid, but it looks sharp. And the Turtle is ultra-rad. He's the right size, the shell pieces are cool beans, and he's articulated well enough for a Lego monster remaining more true to the brick-construction tradition.<br><br>My set has a faulty tail piece, so I had to build it shorter [no black chunk] but I may actually prefer it this way. Also, slightly reorganizing the feet to give them more natural movement is extremely simple.<br><br>Make mine monsters!<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"QuickBricks","2011-04-18T09:01:20.077Z","This is One Fierce Guardian...","<span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">This guardian is a beast! He 
has a lot of features that are reminiscent to that of a dragon. He is 
very fierce-looking and will give Lance a run for his money. Speaking of
 Lance, he is my favorite diver, and his sub is pretty cool as well. It 
doesn't have a cockpit, sadly, but is still nonetheless awesome. The 
flick-fire missiles are somewhat hard to get to, but not impossible to 
fire with some practice. Overall, a great set!</span>",FALSE,4,5,4,4,4
