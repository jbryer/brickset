"vynsane","2010-05-24T21:45:12.387Z","He must be the bravest explorer...","... because I certainly wouldn't man this dinky little thing! Exploring a realm of Sharkmen, Manta Warriors and Squidguys seems a bit more dangerous than this vehicle is capable of handling.<div><br></div><h4>Figures</h4><div>The Atlantis Diver in this set, apparently named 'Bobby', has the standard torso, legs, diver helmet w/neon green visor and lime green flippers. He has a very happy, almost awe-stricken face print on one side of the head and a very (appropriately) panic-stricken expression on the other side.</div><h4>Accessories</h4><div>As with most 'impulse' sets, it's basically an over-sized accessory accompanying a minifigure.&nbsp;</div><h4>Build</h4><div>The build is naturally rather simple, not taking more than a few minutes, but the effect is a well thought out under-sea rover type of vehicle. The fact that it has no visible means of propulsion might bother some.</div><h4>Parts</h4><div>There are a LOT of 1x1 round plates in three colors: Light Blue-gray, Lime Green and Translucent Clear. The handlebars and trapezoidal 'flags' used for the maneuvering flippers will come in handy for MOCers. The most useable piece is the 1x2 brick with studs on the sides - which is GREAT for SNOT techniques.</div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>All in all impulse sets are meant to give you a primer on the related theme, and in that capacity this set achieves its goal. You get an Atlantis Diver and a large accessory for a reasonable price that will have a small, but solid, place in your greater Atlantis fleet, should you so choose to expand it (which I have).</div>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,4

<p>there is&nbsp;<strong>23 pieces</strong> in this set&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>1 minifig</strong>,&nbsp;the diver&nbsp;whits is really nice, it haves douple sided torso, printes legs, douple sided head (happy &amp; scared) and the diving mask is wery cool.</p>

<p><strong>Sea jet</strong>: it isn't small at all, there is lamp on other side of it and&nbsp;on front ther is hook to take something. </p>

"AETerry","2011-01-12T19:41:18.09Z","Atlantis Sea Jet","<p>It's a small set and at it's price of $3.99, it's a perfect stocking stuffer or impulse buy for an Atlantis collection. Well, if you're collecting the Atlantis theme, it's a still a good buy, if you're curious regarding the Atlantis theme, it's not a bad introduction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a set this size, it comes with an Atlantis Diver minifigure who's fairly standard with the lime or neon green for 2010 Atlantis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The small build of the Sea Jet is a good solid little&nbsp;design and functions well for the purpose of this set to provide the diver a means of quickly getting to the sea bed or another area, explore and if danger comes along, he can quickly get away. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By himself, there isn't much you can do with him, but the set complements well with any larger Atlantis sub set where he goes with them.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T12:13:58.913Z","We've found something, sir.","<p>Set #8072 Sea Jet: Another Impulse set from LEGO and another great choice for the Impulse sets in general, the Sea Jet is a nice little addition to any Atlantis or Underwater Theme display. The strength of this set is, despite having so few pieces, this little submarine actually succeeds at looking like a vehicle as opposed to last year's Space Police 3 Space Speeder set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one seems to sell out faster than the other Atlantis Impulse set as well. Paying full price for this set is well worth it, if you haven't gotten one yet I'd say go out and get it, it makes a great little stocking stuffer for the holiday seasons for any Atlantis Theme enthusiast and when compared to other Impulse sets it is worth the cost.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"Sobel","2020-04-28T17:42:43.643Z","Impressive, what little more than 20 parts can do!","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
This one I got as one of the last sets from this series, since it was only available via eBay at that time.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It&#39;s 23 pieces. Oh, come on. What do you expect me to write here???</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One minifigure, a diver with the patented &quot;Janus-head&quot; and diving suit in the neo-green colours of the older part of the series.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>One part to the other, the &quot;engines&quot; with the fins attached the last. EZ PZ.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The small underwater-jet has two steering fins attached to some parts that could resemble some kind of engine and a forward-facing spotlight. The rear end has the known handle for the pilot and in the front is a small gripper to pick up samples.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Once again, what a nice and simple design! Of course, it lacks ANY functions, except maybe putting something in the small gripper. But there is one word really fitting to describe this set: minimalism!<br />
This sub, being so small, has a spotlight, steering fins and even a small arm with a claw! On the other side, what it does not have is... any kind of propulsive device! No propeller, no turbine, nothing. OK. Minimalism. But at least some sort of implication for a propeller or something would have been nice.<br />
But, oh, well, still it is a nice little set which makes best use of only 23 pieces.</p>
