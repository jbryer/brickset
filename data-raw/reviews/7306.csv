"Zrath","2009-11-19T17:02:40.467Z","Small but fierce!","What? No reviews of this awesome little set yet? Inconceivable!
 
I picked this up at my local Los Angeles Toys'R'Us for $9.99 USD recently. In fact, I picked up two of them, and I'm probably going to pick up more!
It's a great little ship with a sealed cockpit, redesigned windshield, and a spiffy new space helmet. The pilot actually wears oxygen tanks!
The ship is very swooshable, and I can easily imagine a squadron of these babies chasing and harassing a larger bad guy ship.
They're also good for escorting your Galactic Enforcer in the really bad parts of the galaxy.

Pros:
1) Nice design
2) Sealed cockpit! (open-air cockpits on spaceships is a pet peeve of mine)
3) Awesome new helmet design! (looks like 'Halo' meets NASA)
4) Good parts selection
5) Redesigned 'A-Wing/B-Wing windshield (with a 2x2 plate built-in for better grip)
6) Twin lasers AND twin missiles!
7) Nice price
 
Cons:
1) Sticker for the instrument panel (goes on a 1x2 smooth plate)
2) Urrrrrrrr...
 
This is simply a great-looking and fun little set.
Buy 4 today! :D

"Loganwan","2009-12-01T19:07:07.637Z","What a great set","This set is amazing.  For $10, you get two minifigs, and an amazingly well designed space craft.  I have one of these sets right now, and I am off in a few minutes to go buy two more.

This set is compact, but full of pieces. It includes 69 very good pieces, that make into a very ""swooshable"" craft. In fact, I was walking around the house flying it around on the way to my Space Police display area.

A word of warning, if you have not collected Space Police before, this is one of those hook-you sets that will really get your juices flowing for more sets.  I really like the rest of the Space Police line, but this is my standout favorite.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jkool","2010-01-07T22:52:56.67Z","Space Police 3 impresses with new 2010 direction.","The Raid VPR is a wonderful little ship that introduces a few new touches to the SP3 theme.  The most notable change in direction is the Space Police Officer helmet, which is now a full-face helmet and an air tank.  This is how the Space Police 3 Officers should've been to begin with.  Is the ""Blacktron"" enemy a sign that we will see Blacktron 3? We can only hope!

The VPR ship itself has a couple of very nice features, including a sealed and removeable cock-pit windshield, something that many of the 2009 sets lacked. 

My biggest complaint with the Raid VPR is that it does not follow the design decisions of the previous Space Police 3 vehicles.  This is due to the forward direction of the wings, as opposed to the reversed wings seen in Hyperspeed Pursuit and Galactic Enforcer.  This is easily fixed by reversing the wings and affixing the lasers to the front, much like the Hyperspeed Pursuit.  This small change makes the ship fit in much better with the other Space Police 3 vehicles.

Finally, I found the inclusion of a sticker for a computer panel was an insult based on how much money Lego is charging for the set.  At 69 pieces and a price-tag of $9.99, the least Lego could have done was included a printed computer piece.

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2009-12-22T18:15:24.717Z","One of SPACE POLICE III's Greatest Sets!","When I got into SPIII, neither this set or ""Smash 'n' Grab"" had been released. I was wondering if any new SPIII sets would be coming around Christmas. I did some browsing on BrickShelf and both of the new 2010 SPIII sets. And this was a set I was ITCHING to get my hands on ever since! And boy, did it live up to my expectations!

PROS
If you've read my reviews of the SPIII line, you know well how much I enjoy the minifigures. That fact is ever true in the ""Raid VPR"" set. Most notable is the new alien criminal, ""Rench."" Though his head is not new in design with merely a color change, his costume is so admirable. It mingles both Blacktron I and Blacktron II costume designs into a wicked, thuggish look, while looking freshened up with that ""2009-2010"" look. Though only equipped with a laser weapon, I still love the figure! The Space Police Commando is another great figure. Even though the only change made was the helmet design, the figure is fantastic; most likely BECAUSE of the helmet! The helmet looks like a LEGO/Halo hybrid! Also, I am happy the Commando figs come with airtanks. The Commando also has a double sided head. 
Certainly the best feature of the set is the incredible Space Police Raid VPR! It's sleek, simple in design, and a mighty good looking law enforcing machine! 

CONS
The only real con I have with this set are the front laser guns. They are not well secured in place and occasionally fall off. 

In short, this much anticipated set, when I finally could grab one, truly lived up to all I thought it would be. AMAZING figures, great ship, and just a great set overall. For 10 bucks, its a great deal! 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Using only 69 pieces, Lego has put together a cool looking small ship. Great for your 6 year old on up just getting into the Space Police theme (easy build) or the adult collector.

Pro's - Design(especially the front two wings)and simple yet effective color scheme, opening/closing cockpit, 2 flick-fire missiles, great new helmet design for your Space Police commando w/air tanks on back and new Rench mini figure w/weapon. Note Rench is same designed head as Kranx but instead he's green and also has different torso design.

Con's - Really none, except I always like to see the Space Police with a hand held weapon. None included here.

Its very simple and elegant with an airtight canopy that opens and closes - unfortunately a rarity these days. I like that its not bulky and overdone with numerous superflous little pieces like many of the Star Wars ships.

Pros: I like the new commander figure and his airtight helmet, and the new alien is supposed to be kranxx's third cousin, which is a neat idea. The ship is pretty sleek and the alien has a large gun, so it's a pretty fair fight.

Cons: the cockpit falls off sometimes, and a tiny hovercraft for the alien would be nice. While the idea of a 3rd cousin is cool, it's also a way for lego to save money.

since the ship is very nicely designed, i'll give this a 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2010-01-30T12:28:39.687Z","I like it, I really like it!","I was a bit shocked when the new SPIII sets came so quickly, so when I found them sitting on a shelf, I just had to get them. This set is a pretty good deal at $9.99, you get more than your money's worth when you consider that you're getting 2 brand new minifigures along with great pieces.

First off, the two new minifigures are:
*1x Space Police Commando - the torso is nothing new, so he blend in perfectly with other officers (So it is officially their standard uniform). Unlike previous Space Police figures, this one has a complete helmet, also with a clear visor so that you can actually see his face. For those of you who love sci-fi MoCs, this helmet is a must have, especially since it COMPLETELY hides the backside of a two-sided face. The visor is trans-red, a testament to the original Space Police who also had T-red visors as well. The figure also has a jetpack and is fully painted, front, back and legs. 5/5
*1x Rench alien - This guy is just a repaint of Kranxx, but somehow the head just seems different. Apparently the two are supposed to be distant relatives. Rench's outfit however, is what's important. He wears a neo-Blacktron I design. It looks like a Blacktron I uniform, but has the Blacktron II logo. He carries some sort of laser-rifle, it looks alright, but it's nothing too special, thankfully the sights on the gun seem to line up to Rench's eye perfectly. 5/5

The focus of the set is a small spacecraft named the Raid VPR. The ship has a small condensed design, and doesn't have too many stickers, though the control panel would have been better off printed. Thankfully the cockpit is sealed, save the tiny corners of the windshield which is left slightly open, though that makes it much easier to open without putting fingerprints/scratches on the cockpit (though this is inevitable, it is merely delayed). 
The ship is fully armed, with two lasers in front and flick fire missiles on the sides, though these aren't held on sturdily enough to actually flick. 
A new part in this set is the cockpit. Although it looks identical to the older design, it now has tabs on the front to keep it from falling off, and it's really sturdy.
The wings look really stealthy in their current positions, but if you like it better, you can always remove them and place them on, tips facing outward, but I like the original design.

The set has a few extra parts, amongst which are the small wedges, one of each T-red and T-blue, so you can always use them to fill in the gaps between the lights on the Raid VPR's wings and the main fuselage. There is also a spare T-red visor, a welcome re-release, since they haven't been available since the space minifig pack from 1991.

Overall, you get a small ship and two figures, maintaining the Good-Evil balance, so you can actually do something with the set. This set is a great gift, and kids/space fans will love it to pieces (literally).
I'd highly recommend it if you don't already have one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"benjadude11","2010-02-24T15:23:15.2Z","Amazing Minifigs","I will be totally upfront about this, I bought this set for the minifigs, and I'm glad I did. The small vehicle, though, impressed me as well. I'll go over that in a moment. Right now, though, let's talk figs.

Rench: 
His head is just a repaint of Kranxxs', but I think the lime green looks better than the original neon orange. The sight on his laser bazooka lines up with his eye really well and looks like he's actually aiming. His head can also be used in about a thousand different ways in Star Wars MOCing, if you're into that. (I sure am.)  I have a feel ing that his shirt has been released before but I can't put my finger on it... maybe I'm hallucinating... I love his pants, they are the typical SP3 alien wear, but no matter how old they get, I'm sure they'll still be cool.

Space Police Guy:
From feet to neck he is totally SP3 '09 but his head isn't. The helmet is completely new and very cool. It's the first translucent red visor piece I've ever seen, and the set comes with a spare, which I put on the officer from Hyperspeed Pursuit. Through the red and blue plastics, the visor looks black, so the driver is very ominous when he's in the craft, but more colorful when he comes out. The head is Duke's, from Power Miners. 

Vehicle:
Surprising. The cockpit piece has extra support in the front, which is all new, although you can't see it in the picture above. There is room in the cockpit for the SP guy to sit without removing his jet pack, and there are only 5 stickers, two of which are basically optional.  The flick fire missiles are, well, flick fire missiles. What I'm trying to say is that they don't work. 

I knocked a point off playability because it's a one-sided fight, seeing as Rench has no speeder. A small one like Frenzy has in Gold Heist would be acceptable. 

Anyway, buy this set. It's a great value at only ten dollars and it's really enjoyable all around.     ",FALSE,5,5,5,4,5
"vynsane","2010-01-19T11:32:13.983Z","Great value, cool design, fun 'Easter Egg'","For the $10 price point this set can't be beat. The design of the ship is very sleek, save for a bit of clunk in the trunk. I would have preferred an inverted fuselage slope to round out the undercarriage in the tail instead of a straight 2x3 inverted slope - it would've lined up better with the bottom of the 2x2/2x2 modifier bracket that holds the jet engine cone on. as it stands, the bottom of the bracket hangs off the end by the height of plate, but it's really the only section that suffers. A varied selection of trans red and blue pieces used for the police lights is also a plus - most SP3 sets I've seen have been heavy with the 1x1 wedge slope (Max Security Transport, Gold Heist, etc) but here you've not only got a pair of those, but a pair of 1x2 smooth plates and a pair of 1x1 domes held on by technic 1/2 clips as well!

The biggest point of 'YAY!' is the hinged windscreen, which seems to have been lacking in the SP3 series to date. Extra pieces include a second control stick/antenna so I put that next to the single stick recommended in the instructions. You also get at least one extra translucent 1x1 cheese wedge (I think red) so if you have other SP3 sets that seem to be lacking lights, you can combine it with an extra blue one. The sticker for the 1x2 flat tile looks cool, even if it is a sticker.

The new helmet design is pretty sweet, though I miss the ability to raise and lower the face mask - once clicked into place, it is fixed until you pop it out again. I guess you can't have everything.

Rench, the alien, makes good reuse of the Kranxx head in a different color. The best part about this guy is the 'Easter Egg' present in the torso design - while much more detailed, the pattern is reminiscent of the torso used in Blacktron 1 (which will probably be mentioned in the bulk of my Space-related reviews, apparently) while the Blacktron 2 logo is displayed as a badge on the upper left are of the chest! While I'm not quite a fan of BT2 (all-white uniforms? Really?) it's just cool to see a nod to the classics. The one thing that I found odd, which I think was brought up in a previous review, is the trans red cone on the end of Rench's gun... shouldn't this be trans neon green like all the rest of the SP3 bad guy's weapons? It's a nit-pick, to be sure, and if future sets have different colors maybe it will be put to rest but for now it stands out as odd.

For those lamenting the lack of hand-held weapons for the SP Commando, the small freeze-ray guns on the inside of the vehicle's forks are only held on by clips - pop them off and your commando is a dual-freeze-ray-pistol wielding action star John Woo style. 

Overall, a great value, a cool bad guy and slick chase vehicle to add to your Space Police arsenal.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>Building experience was simple, but fun. It is a small set, but what comes out of building is fun. Now the minifigs:</p>
<p>Officer- Police commando. Not much to say. There isn't anything new. His body has front and back printing, which I love. He also has air tanks,&nbsp;a jet pack, whatever you please to call it. I especially like his helmet. It looks very armored up and the visor is a very nice red color. I'm not sure if the head is a new print, but it is double sided. </p>
<p>Rench- I keep calling him Kranxx. He looks very sinister with his black outfit and&nbsp;printed on&nbsp;armor. Sadly, there isn't much back printing except for his belt. What is worth mentioning is the Blacktron logo on his clothes. His head is the same as Kranxx only green. I also like his weapon. It's a rocket launcher I suppose. Sadly, due to it's size, he can become rather top heavy. I'll usually flip the gun around, put it in his other hand and have it bazooka style.</p>
<p>Now the ship. First of all, it's very sleek. I do also&nbsp;like how Lego made this to look like a police vehicle. It has the same black and white colors as earth&nbsp;police cars do and it has red and blue lights. Going from the front,&nbsp;you'll see the wings which I think look cool. Here, there are also some guns&nbsp;in front of the cockpit. I'll&nbsp;usually take&nbsp;one&nbsp;off sometimes&nbsp;and give it to the officer as a weapon.&nbsp;The front wings also have POLICE written on them (yeah, it's on&nbsp;a sticker) and on one wing there is a red light, the other has a blue. The cockpit is very roomy and the officer fits inside nicely. Inside, there's a lever for steering, I suppose and another sticker which&nbsp;I can imagine being a dashboard. Behind that&nbsp;is another pair of lights and&nbsp;two more wings. What's interesting about these is that the lights are switched.&nbsp;I actually kinda like this because it adds more variety. At the wing tips there are flick-fire missles. I guess these can be taken off as well and be given to the officer as a gun. All that's left is the engine and tail fin which isn't much. I do, however like that the tail fin has the police logo on both sides as opposed to one.</p>

"AETerry","2010-10-14T10:13:47.083Z","VPR Review","<p>Love many of the sets from Space Police 3. And I especially love the alien badguys they're going after...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it strike anyone else as odd that all the Space Police are ""human"" minifigs and all the villians are of alien races?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That little noted prejudice aside, the set is great, it's a solid build and design. I much prefer the look of the Space Police in the earlier sets for Series 3. And the aliens are just awesome, so much of my pick up for sets has been for the minifigs themselves. Not just whole set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"123MrBrick","2015-06-24T04:11:29.01Z","Awesome Ship.","<p>This is the only good SP3 Commando set, in my opinion. It&#39;s affordable, looks great, and has an exclusive figure.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard box of the era. Front shows action, back shows features. I have no complaints with the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has some cool pieces, like Rench&#39;s gun and the wings on the ship. The Commando&#39;s armor is also great.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with two minifigs, the <strong>Commando </strong>and <strong>Rench. </strong>The Commando is the same as the one in the Smash&#39;n&#39;Grab set. His torso and legs are the same as all the other SP3 officers, but he has a unique face. Both expressions look like a cheesy actor in a bad movie. Rench is the highlight of the set. He has an awesome Blacktron torso and some great leg printing. He shares a head with Kranxx, but it looks awesome in these colors.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set takes about 5-10 minutes. Nothing too complicated.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great. It has a great design and cool weaponry.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I like this set. The play value may seem tilted towards the officer, but the size of Rench&#39;s gun makes you think otherwise. It would be great to get a bunch of these as a squadron. This one is definitely worth looking for online.</p>

"ra226","2012-04-09T00:52:19.313Z","Fun, good looking set, and a nod to the Vic Viper","<p>Space Police III is probably the first ""Space"" theme I've had any interest in since things went down hill in the mid 90's. &nbsp;You have a clear tribute to the Vic Viper in a small, sleek craft, pitted against Rench, who carries a weapon clearly intended to take out a ship the size of the Raid VPR.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Rench, and his gun (a definite step up from the standard pea-shooter hand gun)</li><li>Nod to Blacktron (look closely at Rench's uniform...)</li><li>Design and name is a nod to the Vic Viper, well known from the Gradius video game series and a favorite of the AFOL community</li><li>A great buy at $10</li><li>Extra point just for the ship looking cool, especially for a small set</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>There are stickers, though only a few.</li><li>I made a small modification, but it needed no outside parts</li></ul>
<p>I did modify this set in one simple way: I swapped the wings so they are rear-swept instead of forward swept. &nbsp;It makes the ship look less stubby and faster/more menacing. &nbsp;Since it's an easy mod requiring no extra parts, I wouldn't take any points away from this great set.</p><p><br></p><p>The SP3 theme is still a bit hit and miss in my book, but this set is definitely worth the buy.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Darth_Maul_Epic","2012-12-02T15:27:32.983Z","A Great Set For All Lego Space Fans","<p>As Rench slithers through the allies the Raid VPR is on the hunt to 
track down the vicious criminal... The Raid VPR is a great addition to 
any Space Police collection. <br></p><h4>The Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures are very unique. <br></p><p>RENCH: Rench supports a Blacktron symbol on his torso as a shout out to the old space theme Backtron. Rench's head is a green version of Kranxx's medusa like head. He has the regular pants worn by the other criminals. Rench wields a narrow gun with a round red piece attached to the end.</p><p>SPACE COMMANDO: The space commando has the same torso as the old police, but has a new helmet with a red visor attached. One bad thing is that he doesn't include a gun. The space commando also has a jet pack on him.<br></p><h4>The Model</h4>The completed model is sleek and has two flick fire missiles. Two guns are attached in the front but are not flick fires. The cockpit as an opening windshield, a joy stick and a sticker of the control panel. There are stickers but very few. <br><br>This concludes my review on the Raid VPR. This is a small priced set and very worth it for the minifigures. The ship will look very nice in your Space Police Starfleet!<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4
