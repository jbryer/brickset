"THX_1138","2009-11-28T16:15:53.67Z","Great!","I went to a TRU on Black Friday mainly for something to do before lunch, and they happened to have some 2010 sets, including both SP3 sets! I only wanted to buy this one (I plan to get the other some time though). I'm glad they brought back purple.

Pros: 
-Purple pieces
-Great stickers
-Lovely new helmet on police officer (if only these had been made last summer)
-The ""tow truck"" is quite good
-Great details on the engines
-New 1x3 and 2x4 tiles
-Trans yellow windscreen
-Easy to modify

Cons:
-There are not all that many purple pieces since much of the purple is taken up by large intake pieces on the sides
-Flick-fire missiles (easily removable though)
-Stickers (they're great in this one, though, and I don't mind them much anyway, but many fans hate them)
-The ATM looks pretty weird. I didn't even build it.
-Squidtron's head doesn't look very good in those colors

I would definitely get this set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Captain_Aardvark","2009-12-01T16:40:48.153Z","Great!","   I got this at the Chicago Lego Store, along with the Magma Mech. There is a lot of 2010 sets, like both Space Police 3 sets, 4 racers sets (whose names are: Fast, Strong, Hero and Bad) that include pumps. Now on to this actual set.

    Pros:
   PURPLE!

   Awesome Space Police helmet
   New Pieces

"legojango","2009-12-22T07:42:50.873Z","AWESOME!","I love this set. Basically, it's a gangsterfied purple hover-tow truck. The vehicle is very hollow and has a lot less pieces than I expected. Also, new 1x3 flat surfaces (tiles) are included. Another piece I haven't seen before are the pieces used for the ""tusks"". This is obviosly a new Blacktron vehicle, and Squidtron is a Blacktron, too.

Onto the minifigures. Squidtron is pretty cool, and his shirt has a new logo on the front and back. The commando is also cool, although I am using the helmet for a project I'm working on. The set comes with an extra red vizor, which was smart for LEGO to include an exrta of a piece that we would actually USE. The set also includes an extra of those yellow teeth peices.

The ATM has a new 2x4 flat surface, which will come in very handy in the future. The weird thing about the ATM is that it only opens from the back, so some poor sap won't get his money to drive the family to Martianland. Overall, the set gets a 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Here is my closing of that review:

My rating:
Playability: 4/5. This set is very playable. It was made to be played with. Some stuff falls off easy but I think it's good for safety. Like the swords in the front grill.
Design: 3/5. It's designed well, but I think the ATM looked like they couldn't think of what he could steal or haul away.
Build experience: 5/5. Nothing hard. All perts fit together easy. Only thing is you might need help with the stickers if you want them on straight.
Overall: 4/5. I think it's worth the money. If for parts or minifigs or just for the cool purple colors. It's fun to play with. My son will be getting one for Christmas. He doesn't know this yet. :)

"KJM72","2009-12-05T09:39:55.233Z","Purple Makes a Stunning Return!","(This review comes from my LEGO.com account)

The Smash 'n' Grab is one of my favorite 2010 sets. The minifigures are great. The new Space Police officer helmet looks really cool, and should be useful if you want nice helmet to put on a minifig in your own creation. Squidtron is a great figure. The purple pattern on his head looks great, and the yellow eyes work nicely.

One of the highlights if this set is the stunning return of a purple color. It looks great on this set. If you make your own creations and value your pieces, this set is worth it just for the purple pieces. I have already disassembled this set and used the purple pieces on a mini space ship. The pieces are so useful. Another great color in this set is transparent yellow. It is seen on the windscreen and on a few other pieces.

The small ATM is a nice little build in itself. It has a nice look to it, as it is meant to look like an asteroid. This is revealed in a cool little detail of the set- a sticker reading 'Asteroid Bank ATM' or something along those lines.

The construction of the set is entertaining. The flick fire missle function is pretty fun. The front grill (bumper), I warn you, is only attached by two stud pieces. If you are purchasing this set for a child who wants to 'swoosh' it around, I recommend using a few pieces from your LEGO collection to modify it so it stays on tighter. You will notice this when you buy the set, but it's hard to describe this in words.

.:Pros:.
-PURPLE!
-Minifigs
-ATM
-Trans-yellow
-Great detail for a $20 USD set

.:Cons:.
-Somewhat fragile front bumper
I highly recommend this set. It's worth every penny",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Seriously, the color scheme is AWESOME! I also love the ramming device at the front! The rear engines are TRICKED OUT! Near the engines are to rods, which, when pushed, fire two missiles. Oh, and there's that evil-looking crane. Every bad-guy HAS to dig that. The Hover Truck has even more details, such as it's two clips to hold Squidtron's blaster and wrench, and it's enclosed cockpit. My only complaint is that Squidy can hardly see over the dashboard. I'm also annoyed at how the ATM sometimes falls off of the crane hook. The minifigs make me want to flip with joy! First there's Squidtron. His head is similar to Squidman's, only the eyes and spots have been recolored (it matches his Hover Truck). He also has a new torso. It's a space-age biker jacket with no sleeves. Anyways, onto the Space Police Commando has a new helmet. Now your Space Police can go into the dark void of space without having their faces rearranged by the pressure! Yay! As for the ATM, I don't know why people think it's so weird. It's an ATM ripped out of a wall. What's wrong with that? I honestly think it looks pretty cool!

The new cop is cool with his new helmet and face. The old gun the cop has isn't used much these days, but I like it. Squidtron, HE'S GREAT! The only difference in the squid heads are the eyes and dots on his head. The new torso is another great brick from Space Police. The ATM with 200 dollars is there was nice, but I noticed a difference with my money from Squidman Escape and this. The light green on the corners of the bills were missing on this set, but were still on the bill from Squidman Escape. The ship itself was nice with all those new purple elements and such. It has a tool and a gun. The controls are the same as the other sets. The crane is cool with the yellow and black elements.

"andy87","2010-02-10T22:24:32.17Z","My favorite space police set yet","This set really has it all! The new space police sets are quite amazing and the new figures keep getting better.

Pros:

new space police commander is pretty good. Squidtron has a better color scheme then squidman, and i like the idea of him devolping a mind and running away. The purple ship he drives has a good color scheme and the crane on the back is a neat idea, so is the asteriod atm

cons: well, the commander couldn't stop the ship with a handgun so it's not even close to a fair fight, he could have used a hovercraft. And the crane can't really support the atm that well.

"krysto2002","2010-01-30T13:03:29.06Z","Working flick fire missiles, in a set that looks good! Is it even possible?!!","Yes it is possible, that is one of the many pros to this set.
The Smash 'N' Grab is a welcome addition to the few Black Hole Gang ships available. It's design closely resembles a truck and looks much like Snake's ship. The new color is rather refreshing and I think the ship is very playable (if that's even a word. So on to the review:

Minifigures:
1x Space Police Commando, exactly the same as the one from the Raid VPR, but this one has a laser gun. So far I like his design, so he's still a 5/5 for a minifigure. For a more detailed description, see my review of the Raid VPR, another SPIII set from 2010.
1x Squidtron, same design as Squidman, he's supposed to Squidman's own personal robot-gone-rogue. He was apparently built in his image. While he doesn't have the cape, Squidtron does indeed look tougher than P Squiddy himself, with more of a futuristic look to him. He's fully painted and looks great, even if you use his parts for MoCs 5/5.

Set includes
ATM - A welcome addition to the SPIII props, including the safes and stop sign, light post, and statue. The ATM, from the Asteroid Bank (whose logo looks suspiciously like the classic space logo), lives up to its name as it is built into an asteroid and has a cool asymmetric design. The ATM has a window in front (but you can't see any money unless you put more in) and an interface/console on the front where you would presumably get your money from. The back has flap where you can put stuff in/take it out and there is a convenient attachment on top so that crooks can tow it away.

Space Truck ""Ultimate Ram-Raid Vehicle"" - This is a mid sized vehicle and is approximately the same size as the Skull Interceptor. The cockpit sticks up out of the vehicle, but looks undersized compared to the front of the vehicle. The windshield is trans yellow, just like classic Blacktron sets.
The grill looks absolutely fantastic and has two spikes on it. In the back, there are two large engines, each of which looks wonderfully designed and has plenty of ornamental parts; unfortunately the cones on the tips fall of way too easily, so the set loses a few points there. The crane itself looks rather primitive, save the spikes on the end, but it is effective and can actually hold the ATM without shifting. On the front of the ship is a pair of flick fire missiles, which actually fire VERY WELL by the use of two knobs on the back which can be pushed in but they still don't fire as far as the technic missile launchers.

Pros:
Refreshing design
New minifigures
Working flick fire missiles
Crane and cool ATM
Accessories for both figures (2 guns and a wrench)
Fearsome design

Cons:
Fragile engines
Primitive looking crane

Overall, when you add up the pros/cons, it is still a great set but could be a little cheaper... I still love it and would highly recommend it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2010-01-26T23:01:40.92Z","An amazing set!","I'm really loving SPIII. I have loved it since the beginning, really. But the new 2010 sets are something to love. I'm already impressed with the ""Raid VPR"" set. This set, being the second 2010 set released thus far, is just as and likely better IMO than that one.

PROS
I sound like a broken record in all of my SPIII reviews, but always the top pro of these sets is the Minifigures. I've always loved SPIII minifigs, especially those few that come with a fully equipped SP officer. Not only is this figure a fully equipped officer, but he has that incredibly well designed helmet that signifies him as a Commando! Squidron, though he is a bit of a repeat figure, is still great. 
Easily, the next very apparent pro about this set is that the ship is PURPLE! And I am so happy LEGO chose to give Purple a grand return in such a fantastic set! Now onto the ship's pros. First, its overall design is very spiffy. Hot-rod flames on the front, yellow-tinted window, massive engines and tool racks for Squidtron's blaster and wrench. The engines of the ship have a little more detail to them than many other ship-engines in the toyline, and that is a great plus. I should also mention that Squidron quite easily fits inside the cockpit with hardly any hassle form the person playing with the set. The cockpit roof comes off easy, yet remains secure once in place; it's truly perfect. Now it is a fact that many people feel flick-fire rocket systems are cheesy and gimmicky, which sadly, I agree they are, but I've never had an issue with that to begin with. In this set however, much to my surprise, the flick-fire system is actually NOT gimmicky at all! Instead of actually flicking the missiles themselves, you flick rods at the back of the ship that will in turn smash into the frontal rockets and send them flying with ease. Not only is this much easier and more secure to do, but its AWESOME!
Finally the Asteroid ATM. People have said it's strange and awkward, and I agree, but still I like it. The money within is completely sealed, there's a unique new flat plate piece I haven't seen until now in it, and it just works.

CONS
There really aren't too many cons with this set, but there are some nonetheless. The purple cone pieces inside the engines are much more loose that I thought, and fall out frequently. Also, the crane at the back is a little weak and really isn't cut out to carry that Asteroid ATM, not to mention that the Asteroid ATM is not at all secure when hooked on.

In summary, the set is worth every penny. Great design, AMAZING color, lovable figures, and a beautiful end product that will have you loving what you've bought.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"vynsane","2010-02-15T10:12:06.547Z","Unique colors and parts together = awesome little set","<p>This set is currently on sale at TRU and the website for 20% off, making it $15.99 (starting 14 Feb 2010) so it's even a better deal than if it were full price. Had I purchased it at MSRP the value would have been a 4. As it stands, I also had an ages-old merchandise credit for almost $4, so ended up paying $14 for this set, tax included! But enough bragging... </p>
<p>The biggest pro about this set is the unique parts use and colors. The purple is vibrant and the three 1x3 tiles in light gray and one 1x4 blue tile are new (to me, anyway). The translucent purple 1x1 cones were a surprise as well, and everyone's talking about the purple 1x1 cheese slopes - you even get an extra one! The translucent yellow windscreen is a great throwback to both classic space and Blacktron 1, which seems to be a favorite among the designers of this line. The yellow-on-black stripes and black flames with yellow pinstriping also harken back to Blacktron.</p>
<p>The design of the ship is very utilitarian and at the same time very hotrod. It really looks the way a space tow truck would look, with the color scheme and special adornments. The engines look really beefy and 'upgraded' from what would be the show-room model. The interior is rather spartan and gappy, with but one steering wheel for controlling the vehicle. htey could have easily thrown in a computer console or patterned brick under the hood.&nbsp; Squidtron is a nicely done repaint of Squidman, though the backstory of him being a robot because Squidman is the only known specimen of his race is a bit hard to swallow.</p>
<p>The 'Asteroid Bank' ATM is a unique additional item, comprised mainly of reddish-brown slopes of all shapes and some light gray and blue pieces. The computer terminal isn't printed (they could have easily used one of the classic space terminals and gotten away with it. As it is, the sticker looks good, but not great. The 'Asteroid Bank' sticker, which is placed on the 1x4 blue tile to become the sign, looks fantastic, though. It features a nod to Classic Space in the logo, which is cool. It also comes with two more $100 bills.</p>
<p>The Space Police Commando is an expected addition, though in this case he lacks a conveyance of any kind, so it's even less of a fair fight than, say, 'Container Heist' where the officer at least has a chain to hang onto for dear life. You can pretend that the airtanks are a jetpack the way I used to when I was a kid (they were dual-purpose), and then there's no problem!</p>
<p>Extra pices include one yellow 'tooth', one black technic pin, one trans red visor, one purple 1x1 cheese slope, one 1x1 dark gray cheese slope, and one of each translucent 1x1 round stud: red, dark green, neon green and orange.</p>
<p>Let's do a pro's and con's list, and utilize the nifty new markup.</p>

"Kalhiki","2010-05-24T10:30:42.7Z","Big, Fancy Truck in Good Colors.","<p>Purple... Yellow... My favorite colors. So instantly, I wanted to get this set. It's a nice tow truck obviously suited up to Squidtron's liking.</p>
<p>I don't really like going into building experience because I never know what to say. The build was pretty easy, and making the engines in the back was fun. Applying the stickers was also not much of a challenge. Now the minifigs.</p>
<p>Officer: He's the new commando design. He has great detail with the armor and also has some oxygen tanks. I guess&nbsp;it could also be a jetpack, but the design looks more like air tanks. His helmet is also nice, but with no flip up helmet. But, come on, who would want to lift their visor when there's no air in space? He also comes with a gun, which is kinda thin, but at least it isn't big and clunky.</p>
<p>Squidtron:&nbsp;Being Squidman's&nbsp;robot likeness, you got the same head mold. However, it has purple barnacles on his head and a bluish-grey face.&nbsp;But I do prefer this paint job over&nbsp;P-Squiddy, because it's darker and says ""I'm a renegade space crook"". As for his body, he has the same pants as other crooks, and the skull belt. Then he has a nice looking black and red coat. His weapon is the same as the Officer, but with a yellow stud. I guess you could also call the wrench a weapon as well. Both of these can clip on the either side of the truck.</p>
<p>As for accessories go, you have the odd Asteroid ATM. While the nae sounds cool, I still don't know why there'd be an ATM on a space rock.&nbsp;That's almost like you driving down&nbsp;a country&nbsp;road and seeing an ATM on a tree stump.&nbsp;But regardless, it does have a nice rocky look, and a hollow inside to put the two one-hundred dollar bills that come with the set.</p>
<p>The ship is great. I'll start off with the front. The grill has great detail such as the gate (probably for raming), headlights, and two spikes (also probably for raming or smashing). There is also another pair of headlights, but they really aren't. Those are the&nbsp;well hidden&nbsp;flick-fire missles.I'll get to them later. Continuing on down you get the front engines, which have cool black flames outlined in yellow. That looks pretty cool. On the hood there is a yellow stripe that is continued on the top. The cockpit is also very nice in its yellow-gold transparent color. Sqiddytron also fits perfectly inside, but I wish he was sitting higher. Only his eyes are peeping out. On the top are two cheese slice pieces in the same color as the cockpit, and they also blend well with the yellow stripe.</p>
<p>The back has two nice, detailed engines as most space police ships have. Only probablem, though is that the cones on the front of the engines can fall off if&nbsp;bumped.&nbsp;Nearer to the center is the mechanism (if you can call it that) to fire the missles. I'll get to that, I promise, but not now. In the middle is the hook. I thought it wasn't going to be able to hold the ATM, but it does. And quite well. There are also some yellow spikes that are actually new. The same mold, but filled with a rubbery plastic. I guess they don't want anyone to hurt themselves. The&nbsp;arm is also yellow, which continues the aformentioned stripe.&nbsp;I do find something weird. There's a sticker that has ""max: 250.000 $"". This doesn't make any sense. why would it be a dollar sign? shouldn't it be like&nbsp;lbs. or tons? This leads me to believe that Squiddytron wanted to be funny and changed the weight to money.</p>
<p>Okay, the flick-fire missles. I built up this much suspense on something that isn't very spectacular. All you have to do is hit the ball joint on the axle rod&nbsp;to fire it. It is nice, I guess, since you don't have to actually hit the missle itself. What I find annoying is that they're loose. They slide back and forth making ""tap shhhhh tap"" every time you&nbsp;face&nbsp;the ship&nbsp;up or down. Along with that, the ATM bangs up against the ball joints making a bothersome&nbsp;""tap tap clatter tap""&nbsp;if it swings. This isn't a big deal since it doesn't affect the design and such, but it's an annoying noise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is an excellent set. $20.00 is a good price. I was debating if that was a little too much, but 15 is too little and somewhere in between would just be kinda akward (you don't see many 17 dollar sets out there). So if you like Space Police, I'd get this set. If you want to see what SP is like and what to expect from the sets, this is a good first impression set. I highly recommend it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

"quickbuild1234","2010-09-13T16:55:07.303Z","Review: Smash 'n' Grab","Building Experience: This set has a lot of pieces that are fun to snap on, and there wasn't anything too hard to put together. The stickers could get a little bit annoying to apply to curved surfaces, however.<br><br>Parts: There are a couple nicely flexible spike pieces at the front of the ship, along with some handy dollar bills. The purple color was a nice refresher to the refrain of black and white space ships that have been churned out redundantly within Space Police lately, and overall curve pieces that formed the rugged sleekness of the set turned out well.<br><br>Minifigures: We have a Space Police captain, again, a break from the near clones that form the rest of the Space Police armada--instead of a half-covering black visor (who knows how they see through those things??) there's a transparent red visor and a full gray helmet, along with a more sophisticated armor design. In terms of Squidtron, he pales in comparison with his cousin Squidman, but since he's such a ripoff of him, it's impossible not to have a nice headpiece; pincers, tongue, bulbous eyes, and unique shape, but the color scheme is no where near to Squidman's. Replacing the red cape and green reptilian body, there are bare gray arms and a black Skull Gang suit.<br><br>Playability: The missiles are nice, and subtle as well, a feature looked over in the design of many sets. They are easy to fire, go a fair distance, and you never would even know they are there until they are released. The hook carries the vault nicely, but it falls off some, and occasionally bends the arm toward the ground a little. Often the cockpit window will snap off with the roof when putting in Squidtron. But the main con to this set is that there is no Space Police vehicle--not even a little speeder like similarly priced Gold Heist. <br><br>Value for Money: 188 pieces, including some fairly good ones, is a pretty good deal for $19.99. Throw in a couple unique minifigures and a good missile launching system, and this set has enough brick for the buck.<br><br>4/5<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"legoDad42","2010-04-15T20:08:48.06Z","Tow-Truck in SPACE!","<h4><em>Smash N' Grab</em> is a neat small to mid size set with nicely designed Space Tow-Truck and floating ATM machine. At only 188 pieces it gets the most out of them and is excellent for parts and playability!</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PRO's...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall tow-truck design looks great and 'chunky'. Has a heavy look with 2 nicely designed rear engines (looks as if you could detach the rear engines and with a little Mod'ing they can be turned into small escape or shuttle craft).</li>
<li>Front Grill is well designed with 2 spearing weapons.</li>
<li>Front also has 2 flick fire missiles (w/round trans-orange tips) that are fired using technique bars (at the rear) which slide forward (tap/push these hard and fast for proper effectiveness).</li>
<li>Cockpit opens with nice trans-yellow windshield.</li>
<li>Left and right of cockpit are clips to hold weapons or tools.</li>
<li>Mid/rear of ship has a working crane with hook (5 points of articulation).</li>
<li>Both back/rear engines are equipped with forward laser cannons.</li>
<li>Uniquely designed ATM machine (from the Asteroid Bank) which appears to be part of a small asteroid&nbsp;with &nbsp;'alarm' horns at the bottom and rear opening hatch/safe with 2 dollar bill tiles (space inside looks decent enough to hold 2 more gems or tiles).</li></ul>
<p>Mini-Figs are good with a standard Space Police Officer(duel faced)&nbsp;w/the new air-tight helmets, laser/freeze pistol and airtank backpack. Squidtron is a new character here although the head sculpt is the same as Squid-Man but Squidtron is grey headed with purple design atop head and yellow eyes, black torso vest (front/back printing), grey arms with black hands and black (front printing) legs.</p>
<p><br/><strong>CON's...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cockpit doesn't have hinge for opening/closing. </li>
<li>Interior cockpit sparse, bare...no details.</li>
<li>For a space vehicle the&nbsp;only 'control's'&nbsp;is a&nbsp;standard steering wheel piece.</li>
<li>Stickers on hood and top of cockpit don't work design wise to me but the flame designed stickers work well enough to give it a hot-rod like look.</li></ul>
<p>Overall this is one neat vehicle. I was skeptical seeing the color scheme online but in person, the purple against the black and grey details go together well. The crane is a great play function and works well hooking onto the space ATM machine (neat logo sticker for the Asteroid Bank). This set is high on playability and compliments the other Space Police sets perfectly. I <strong><em>recommend </em></strong>picking this up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Quick suggestions</em>...the truck can be Mod'ed to attach wheels and put in your town/city set (for a new unique vehicle) and another set that would benefit from swapping out the grey pieces for chrome bricks. And, mentioned before, the 2 rear engines can be taken off and Mod'ed to become small shuttles.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"Dragon_Master_48","2013-12-08T19:09:28.797Z","Glorious, Glorious Purple!","<p><strong>5982 Smash 'n' Grab</strong> is one of the sets in the ""second wave"" of the Space Police III theme (sets 5981-5985), that, in my opinion, really shows the best of the theme; it's a shame that the storyline involving Brick Daddy wasn't continued on for another wave. Although this vehicle itself bears a number of similarities to previous vehicles (5972 in particular), it has its own unique style and attribute that contribute to this being a marvelous set.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Outside of truck uses a lot of purple pieces (and yellow/black/grey color fit with the color scheme).</li><li>Space ATM doesn't feel like a useless add on with truck crane.</li><li>Well-designed truck.</li><li>Rather enjoyable build.</li><li>Exclusive Squidtron minifigure.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No vehicle for Space Police officer.</li><li>A few stickers to place on (for those who don't like stickers).</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I heartily recommend this set to any LEGO Space enthusiast, or just the casual consumer who wants an interesting set to build, contemplate, and rebuild again and again!</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
