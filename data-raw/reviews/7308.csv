Glad to see Lego make something cool and simple for the boys who have grown out of the ""baby"" Lego's but are not quite ready for the more complicated sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"parchioso","2010-02-01T01:58:56.077Z","No excitement but worth exploring","Before I saw this set on display in local Toysrus yesterday, I barely knew about what Ben 10 is, but I still got this set, just to have a hands on experience with the new line. And among the 6 sets on display, I only find this Spider Monkey more interesting.

The parts are indeed very different, even more on-its-own than the Bionicle series, big parts that can be used to assemble the thing in a few minutes, no regular bricks (Bionicle sets would still include some, even mostly are technic), I think this is to cater a different market, very likely young people loyal to the cartoon show.

But the design of this model is kind of interesting, very playable as you can pose the creature in different ways with a lot of flexibilty, I even tried turning it into a spider-like creature and it works! The color mix is nice, and I think the parts are technic compatible just like Bionicle.

Although I have no excitement about the product line, getting a box for experience is not bad, and I think it is worth it to explore the new parts, they can be useful in building MOCs I think.

I have a pictorial review showing how I pose the creature, as well as some close looks on the parts:

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set came in a normal box which showed Spidermonkey on the front. The instructions were simple and I had no trouble with them. There are also some combo models to build, but I can&#39;t find the instructions anywhere.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Spidermonkey is made mostly of unique parts. He shares his torso with the other aliens, but in his colors. His head is exclusive to this set and glows in the dark. His limb pieces are also exclusive to him in these colors.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this figure is just a matter of snapping the pieces together. Easy for all fans.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks like Spidermonkey. I wish the arms and legs didn&#39;t have holes, but that was to make them reusable for aliens with spikes. He is extremely posable, which is also a plus.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like the Ben 10 sets. Spidermonkey is one of the best because he has four arms and he just looks good. I always love making new aliens with these. My only complaint is that no enemies were made in this line.</p>
