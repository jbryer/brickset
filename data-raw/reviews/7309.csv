"KJM72","2010-01-28T19:20:38.42Z","Well, It's Sand Green, But...","Swampfire doesn't really come through for me. I thought everyone was criticizing prematurely when we first saw the pictures, but these new Ben 10 sets are very poor in real life.

To start, there are a few advantages of this set, and one is the return of sand green. Pieces in the ball-joint variety haven't been seen in this color since Bionicle 2006. The color is really nice, but the all-sand green chest armor is made useless because of an off-center insignia in the center of the chest. The limb pieces are very hollow on the inside and hard to integrate into MOCs due to the ugliness that is the inside on the upper legs. 

The actual torso piece is really nice. It has an awesome spinal curve and a few plus hole connections, as well as an extra set of ball joints in the high-midsection of the torso.

Pros:

-Sand Green
-Nice Torso
-Feather-like pieces

Cons:

-Very Hollow
-Hands are rubbery
-Hard to achieve cool poses with nothing to hold
-The insignia in the center of the chest is off-centered ><
-No Technic pin-hole connections
-Steep Price

It's really not worth it...",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

<p>every thing sucks about this set </p>
<p>It is ugly, boring, stupid. The most fun you can have with this set is useing it for target practice!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

"123MrBrick","2015-06-26T18:09:09.583Z","Great set!","<p>Swampfire was one of my favorite aliens in the Ben 10 series, so naturally I had to pick this up. It&#39;s great!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This figure came in a standard box. The front showed the alien in an action pose.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Swampfire shares the mold for all of his pieces with the other aliens, but they are in his unique colors. The only exception is the head, which looks great and is totally unique to this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set is very easy. All you have to do is snap the parts together. It&#39;s something any fan can do.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great and is very poseable. The holes all over his body are kind of annoying, but they are necessary for avoiding making a lot of new pieces for each alien.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is great. It&#39;s a lot of fun to pose and mix and match with other aliens. I gave this set five stars overall because, unlike Spidermonkey, I love Swampfire.</p>
