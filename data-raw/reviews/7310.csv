glow in the dark eyes and sign thing
7 little pointey things

cons:
dark blue not purple
face is a little messey (when you buy it you will see)

ok I like this set a lot so I say get it! 5/5 or 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cyndimoore77","2010-01-04T10:39:50.437Z","Yay, fun!","Lots of fun, but I bought three sets for my son so we could build the cool combination model on the back. Instructions are touted as being on Lego.com, yet they are not available.  So far we have not found the combo instructions anywhere, so now I wish I had not went out and bought the entire group....other than that...easy and fun to build.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"18th_Angel","2010-01-07T23:22:30.937Z","Not Bad","Chromastone is a pretty good set. a little pricey for what you get (though i'm in canada so...)

the pieces all fit together nicely except for the pink rubber spikes that fit into his back. the axle holes are just a little too big and the spikes feel loose. this can be fixed if you put them along the centre of his spine.

there is nothing to hinder articulation so he can really move! the only joints that aren't tight are the pink rubber hand/claws. they are pretty loose and can come off with little force. though it shouldn't really be too much of a problem because they aren't designed to hold and weapons. 

this figure is super tall! but it's also very light and feels kinda insubstantial. bit of a shame. overall that's not really enough to take away the fun of the actual figure. he looks cool and quite imposing.

really hope they do other Ben10 characters, like Goop and wildmutt.

Pros:

Nice articulation
(mostly) stiff joints
fairly tall for an action figure

Cons:
Pink rubber hands and spikes

"Legoboy01","2010-06-13T14:49:19.123Z","AWESOME!","This set I got for my 9th birthday from my dads friend. It is my favorite Alien Force figure and hero. The only part that could've been better is the spikes on the back of him. Although it is a very very very very good set and it is really fun to play with if you have the other alien force guys which I don't.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"aaronbill3","2019-03-08T22:46:09.943Z","Not surprised the line failed, honestly","<p>While this set presents good value for money, it presents a very poor building experience as every piece is so totally obvious as to what it is. Mine came with the torso pieces assembled out of the box, which was weird. I&#39;m a massive fan of Ben 10&nbsp;(check the Ben 10 wiki some time, I&#39;m an admin there) and LEGO yet this set is a massive disappointment to me as both. The pink crystal pieces that are supposed to fit into his back do not stay there very easily due to the soft rubbery plastic they are made of. If this set were remade using the modern big-fig building system I could&#39;ve seen it being a very nice build, but I can&#39;t even recommend this set for its parts given how they were custome-made for this line and are useful for little other than dark blue and black creatures with pink hands and Chromastone&#39;s head. I suppose the pink crystal pieces could make for good parts, but be aware they don&#39;t fit very well.</p>
