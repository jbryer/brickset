On this one I especially like the wing. The combination models suggested in the instructions look great! Will have to try them once we get a few more Ben 10 sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"michaelvader","2010-01-02T20:35:45.297Z","I was the 1st guy to review all the ben 10 sets but not this one","I like Jet Ray a lot and on the side of the box it says super jet ray so I don't know what that is but here are the pros and cons!

pros:
Tail
dark red chest
head looks nice
glow in the dark eyes and sign on his chest
wings are hard rubber but can move easelliy

cons:
hard to pose with wings but they are still cool

I like this a lot so get it! 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
