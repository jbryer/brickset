pros:
new pieces
11-12inch.
good armor

cons:
I got it for $20 and there is 20 pieces! $1 per pieces!
the claws are made out of hard rubber
the blue part on the arm kind of gets in the way when you bend it.
the Ben 10 thing on the chest is a sticker but the machine that makes it puts it on badly.

so I say if you like Ben 10 get it or if you MOC because they fit on Bionicle parts.

As I mentioned in my 8409 review, the sets contain big parts that are not typical Lego, and the whole thing can be built quickly by attaching the joints, this is a new design and there are no bricks nor minifigs in the set. Big Chill's special feature is the pair of wings.

The flexibility of this design is quite impressive, you can make a lot of postures easily, all you need to do is to adjust the combination of joints of the four limbs. I have shown a few examples at my blog:

At this moment, I have reservations for Lego to have such type of design, but as a toy, I would say this is kind of interesting and playable, but whether this is what Lego should do, I like to listen and learn more about others' comments for driving deeper thoughts. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some useful new limb pieces 
<li>Wings looks especially cool 
<li>Clawed hands also show potential&nbsp; 
<li>Looks very much like the actual cartoon character... from what I can tell 
<li>Quick and simple to build... if you're into that</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Very few parts considering how expensive it is 
<li>Some of the armor / limb pieces are bulky and hollow-like 
<li>Quick and simple to build... thus nothing complex or exciting here.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're a fan of the Ben 10 series or just want a winged humanoid, this set is okay for you.&nbsp; Otherwise, some of the other ""buildable"" figures are far more worth it.</p>",TRUE,2,3,2,3,1
