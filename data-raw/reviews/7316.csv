The ben ten things are just trying to copy bionicle, except for these guys stink. $15! Guys, if you were planning on buying this, please listen to me and do not. It is not worth fifteen dollars. Buy a bionicle instead. They are the same kinda things, except for less money and better quality. small ones are $8, normal ones are $10, and huge ones are $20.",FALSE,2,2,2,3,1

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The brown limb pieces are nice to build with 
<li>The head / neck design is very interesting, and I could see some building value for the neck piece.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The fists are hollow and empty looking.&nbsp; I expected a more solid look, but sadly <FONT color=#000000>Humungousaur </FONT>lacks that. 
<li>In general, the price to piece ratio is unacceptable</li></ul>
<p>Unless you like Ben 10 or want the brown pieces, this set isn't that great, even when compared to other Ben 10 sets.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,1
"EpicMindvolt","2018-07-05T21:23:49.31Z","Honestly Not A Great Set","<p>Box/Instructions:</p>

<p>Nothing really special about them. The box looks cool, but other than that they do their job and not much else.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>I do not like these pieces. They are very specialized, so it is hard to integrate them into MOCs or other creations. The torso, thankfully, is really mad eup of two pieces. One is a black frame and the other is the tan chestplate. You can take of the printed tan piece and use the black frame for something, but other than that none of the parts are special or useful except in this set.</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>There are none in this set.</p>

<p>The Build:</p>

<p>Very quick and easy build. You do not even need the instructions to build this. It is only 14 pieces, and you can&nbsp; build it probably from memory.</p>

<p>The Completed Model:</p>

<p>I guess it would be ok for kids who are fans of the show, but I never even watched cartoon network, so I have no clue what this creature&#39;s place is in the show. Unless you are a kid, the completed model really has no significance.</p>

<p>Overall Opinion:</p>

<p>When I was younger, my dad took me to Wal-Mart to buy the 7591 Construct-a-Zurg set, and when I arrived there, I saw that set and this one, and for a split second, I thought this set was better and I decided to buy this instead. I eventually did get 7591 like six years later, but I do not think it was worth the wait; I should have bought it then and skipped this set. Although is is a pretty bad set, I am glad to have it now that I am older, just because it is a bad set. If you are thinking about getting this, you really shouldn&#39;t unless you are looking for the worst sets LEGO has ever made; in that case, this set (or the theme as a whole) could be a contender.</p>
