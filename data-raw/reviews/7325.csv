"albcheng123","2010-01-05T23:52:24.687Z","Excellent for Ocean Terrain","Finally the Lego company releases the ""32 x 32 baseplate (blue)"", which should be perfect to become the ""Ocean Terrain"" for scenes such as pirate ship battle, voyage by an explorer or modern city port operation.

Highly recommended for those lego players who love marine-related themes!

"parchioso","2010-01-08T07:36:54Z","Probably the most needed new 2010 set - for MOC building","As expected, 620 is the same blue baseplate as released earlier, although the color looked very slightly different (the new one darker) at my first glance but I think that could be an misperception only, inspecting closely and I think they are of the same quality. But if anyone notice any quality issue during building process, I hope they would let everyone knows about it.

Lego responded to customer needs and make this available, and this can probably be fast selling, the only thing uncertain is how long they will be available generally. To play safe, keeping a few in inventory is ok, as they are really very useful.

The US Pricing is excellent, but they sell at a very unreasonable price at Hong Kong, which is really disappointing. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"CCOOK","2010-01-11T13:21:55.45Z","Excellent","Was just about to buy up a bunch of these for an extortionate price from eBay or Bricklink, when LEGO decided to re-introduce them - I bought 5 of them from Toys R' Us and will be buying several more - they are an absolute necessity for any type of large pirate base/island/shipwreck scene - I have already used all five as ocean surrounding a large pirate base and tower (and a custom Rock Island Refuge) where I have docked a Barracuda and Schooner.

Even with no land patterns drawn on them, they are still very useful - all you need is some mountain pieces and grey bricks to build anything you want on them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"HQuiff","2010-02-13T16:58:48.717Z","Basic Use, However Essential","There isn't much to really review here, especially on notes such as the Building Experience, as this has none. As for the Value, well I got it from Bricklink for a reasonable 5 Euro, however the original Price is 7 or 8, so I'm basing my Rating off the original rather then what I got it for.

However now that I have established the reasons for lower ratings, let me tell you my experience and everything else included.
Well to start with, I am very glad that LEGO Re-Released this, as it is a hard thing to try and find any baseplates that can act as a Sea or River, even a Canal. 

Well, so far I have not used it for much, other then a port and Beach Waves. I received 4 in total, which made a great deal of use, as I can now have ship being able to dock. 

I cannot seem to find anything else to say really, as there isn't that much. Slightly off-topic, I'd like to thank Huw for this great new Rating System that he has installed. I like it's format and that way you can rate things.

"legostarwarsdude","2010-07-25T20:53:01.89Z","Blue Building Plate ","<p>I got the Blue Building Plate at Toys R Us. The only reason I bought this set is because I put my minifigures on it. I give it a D+. It is better then the green building plate. This lego piece is only $4.99. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HERE IS THE LEGO.COM DESCRIPTION</p>

<p><strong>Whether you're constructing an ocean scene or just like the color blue, this 32x32 stud building plate is the perfect starting point for building, displaying, transporting and playing with your LEGO creations.</strong></p>

"AETerry","2010-09-12T23:33:50.587Z","Blue Base Plate A-hoy!","<p>As always, base plates are&nbsp;a must when building and constructing sets and designs. And the blue one is good for those sets that are water-based.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At $5, the price is decent, and if LEGO keeps these in stock, there should be no reason to ever pay an inflated price on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the more I think on it, the more it seems LEGO should consider releasing a blue plate that's an X-Large at 15""x15"" to really capture an ""at sea"" scene.</p>

"MCAdventureCity","2014-01-18T14:16:16.147Z","Great Accessory","<p>This set is a great accessory for any display or scene that has water. I have five of them and I find them very useful as water in my town displays.</p><p>Although there is no building experience, (As it being an accessory), and it is a little expensive, It is a great accessory for your LEGO Creations.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,4,2
"CaptainVictoria","2021-04-11T22:39:18.663Z","Plain but versatile","<p>I recall that I got this when I was 6 years old, Legos&nbsp;have been lost and found again in my collection, but my Blue Baseplate has always stayed around.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of much to say about it, I used it for all kinds of things, the sea, a padded playground, the carpet for an&nbsp;arcade, lots of things!</p>

<p>I have to say, it&#39;s very sturdy, and very flexible, I once bent it, and it bounced back and smacked me in the face.</p>

<p>I would prefer it to be a lighter blue, but it&#39;s still very enjoyable. My siblings like to use it more than I do.</p>

<p>Overall, the price was high for a baseplate, but take into consideration that the price-per-piece count changes depending on how much plastic is used (or at least it should), it&#39;s obviously&nbsp;much larger than a stud. Due to it being so big, my structures would sometimes fall off of it, I think it might have warped over the years.</p>

<p>Anyway, I like it, I&#39;m not a critical person, so I may be too soft on it, but I enjoy baseplates, I even used it for things other than Legos, I used it as a countertop for my dolls even.</p>
