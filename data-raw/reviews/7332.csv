<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bulk of the Taxi Station is all one piece, allowing a child to still play with that. The car is easy enough to put together and a minifigure to play with for hours of play.</p>

<p>Many fun hours as a young child playing with Fabuland.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
"bookmum","2016-10-27T14:56:33.6Z","Not the most exciting set but had (and still has) lots of use.","<p>I don&#39;t remember getting this set, I have always assumed I got it the Christmas after I got Catherine Cat&#39;s Cottage (see my review about that one). When it is built as it&#39;s actual set it is a little bit dull, just the garage and the car. The early Fabuland cars were a bit more&nbsp;fiddly - later ones came with molded front headlights and better windshields, making them easier to build.&nbsp;I don&#39;t remember the headlight sticker so I assume it disappeared fairy quickly. Same for the big sticker that said Taxi. This was probably gone fairly quick because if you wanted to re build with the bricks, you had to peel off the sticker. Mostly I used this as a garage for Catherine&#39;s Cottage. I loved the blue colour next to the cottage&#39;s yellow.</p>

<p>From an adult point of view there isn&#39;t much to this set, but 35 years or so since I got it, it is still going strong and has had a pretty good life. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The pig was called Percy in my version - not Blondie as it says on the Brickset list.</p>
