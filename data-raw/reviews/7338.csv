"Cake_Crafted","2014-08-25T20:15:01.993Z","Lovely Little Set","<p>I was lucky enough to pick this set up at a charity shop where a few other old LEGO sets have been found.</p>

<p>I love the simplicity of these old models, having mostly standard bricks without any of the fancy ones we have today that can often only be used in one set (not meaning to criticize LEGO&#39;s newer sets) gives it a nice, sturdy feel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lack of a minifig (due to the set being released before minifigers became available) does bring the playability down a little but this is still great fun to play with especially if you have some similar models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can&#39;t rate the building experience due to the fact that I do not have the instructions and have been scared to take it apart incase I can&#39;t get it back together again.</p>

<p>Overall a nice little set which I would give a 4 out of 5!</p>
