<p>This set is one of my favorites. I think this set is really good and I&nbsp;would&nbsp;recommend it to many people and my friends. I wish LEGO would make more new weapons! LEGO is great at making movie sets, but hopefully this will have something to do with the PoP movie!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

Only downside: Double face.</div><div>Onto the Hassassins.  </div><div>Axey has a chest plate with blue sleeves and pants and a black turban/wrap thing. His face is mustachioed with an eyepatch.

The skeleton, too, is not new and that's why I love him. He is old school. The way you can tell if a skeleton is old school is by his shoulders. If his arms are loosely attached by ball and socket joints, then he is old school.

"Lint","2010-05-21T09:12:40.357Z","Great minifig value!","I bought this set primarily because I thought it had good value. It contains a Prince Dastan minifig, 2 hasassins, a skeleton, a couple of critters and a terrain feature. The building experience is nothing to write home about. Playability is decent, and if this depicts an actual scene in the film (it's not out yet so I don't know) I would give it an extra brick for playability.<br><br><h4>PROS</h4><ul><li>Good Value &amp; Playability<br></li><li>Hasassins have mean looking weapons and are oozing with character</li><li>A variety of great parts: new X sword holder, 2 new design katanas, double sided dastan head, scorpion, snake, all the weapons, gems, hinge, saddle and horse. Plus they give you a spare claw weapon! Spare minifig accessories almost never happen!</li><li>The secret compartment gimmick for the gems actually works well.<br></li><li>Very pretty prints, especially on horse.</li><li>Old school skeleton!</li></ul><h4>CONS</h4><ul><li>Rubbish building experience.</li><li>Dastan looks way too much like Indiana Jones</li><li>Probably a little low on the parts count if you're concerned about that sort of thing<br></li><li><br></li></ul>Overall this set is pretty good value in my opinion, especially compared to the more expensive Toy Story and Star Wars battlepacks. You get three+1 minifigs, an arabian horse and a couple of lesser critters and a generous amount of weapons/accessories. While other sets might give you more grams for your buck, I think the quality and variety of what in this set makes it much better value. <br>",TRUE,5,5,1,4,4
"parchioso","2010-04-06T03:27:52.217Z","Nice minifigs + Desert parts","<p>After a very positive experience with the largest set in the theme (7573 Battle of Alamut), I would say I have the same level of satisfaction with 7569 Desert Attack, only one caveat, the price mark-up in my geography is too high!!</p>
<p>In this set you get the same Dastan from other sets, but you can get Claw Hassansin and Hatchet Hassansin only from 7567, the horse is another star item here, but the skeleton, scorpion and snake are only nice extras to me.</p>
<p>There is nothing special about the structure, except the gray plant and sand color plant bush, which are new I think, Desert is a mysterious landscape and this theme gives us now the necessary elements to bring it to the world of Lego!</p>
<p>The double sword Destan is really a very cool minifig, especially with the double face, which shows the gentle and heroic sides of the personality, it would be fun to try to create combat scenes with him.

<p>Besides the above, you get a tan shrub and a few tan pieces.&nbsp; Not much for the builder here, but the figures offer plenty of possibilites.</p>

<p>Assain #2</p>
<p>&nbsp;Well a awesome body and new claws. The body has some sort of armor. He has metal claws, and spike sholder armor. He also has some robe hat.</p>

<p>Not much but the aesome thing is that you can hide crystals under a small bush. Also some spears and a new bush piece. Theres also a new horse. It so awesome!</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,3
"Orthobotrex","2011-01-08T20:55:39.75Z","Cool Pack of Whackers","<p>If you're the type of guy who enjoys minifigs more than anything else, this&nbsp;set is for you!&nbsp;And this review will be&nbsp;done&nbsp;looking through the prism of a minifig collector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main catch would be the Hassansins and Dastan. The prints on the torsos&nbsp;of the main character and the claw Hassansin&nbsp;are exquisite: the other Hassansin has a simple design.&nbsp;The villains&nbsp;could well represent &nbsp;the 1 million Persians that the 300 Spartans should fight. The headwraps are brilliant and built of sturdy plastic. The face prints are ""seamless"" and appear embedded to the flesh colored head. I would like to see the type of color of the &nbsp;prints on Dastan's legs done on other figs as these are brilliantly rendered, though on a small detail only. The new sword sheath is a gem of a piece, as I could imagine using it on other figs, ninjas in particular. And you can give that guy the extra claw weapon as well. The skeleton is standard: love those wiggly arms!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The horse is not new but I like the prints, which are very arabesque, with emphasis on geometric shapes. Bot others just might view this as a rug on top of a horse. The snake and scorpion are standard. But hey, 3 animals, yeah!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other components are a simple build but cute, secret compartment and all. The bush is nice, but the color is quite different, as well as that given to the other plant piece:&nbsp;are they&nbsp;dried up plants or are they in their natural state? :-) And you'll like the gems that come with this set. Now, what do you do&nbsp;with the extra cheese slope?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only drawback I encountered, as said in another review,&nbsp;was with the claw weapons and the swords. These are made of the same pliable plastic material, and the claws got dents as I tried to fit them in. So, I didin't try fitting the swords on Dastan's hands, lest&nbsp;the same thing happens and it gets ruined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got this set at a discounted price so I gave this a very high mark&nbsp;on value for money.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
"grelb32","2010-06-26T16:55:32.713Z","Best Battle Pack Ever!","When I got this set at Toys R Us, I had to decide between it or Ambush in Cairo. I ended up buying this, and when I got home, I was really glad that I did.<br><br>The set itself is a very quick but satisfying build. I absolutely love the way they made the base, and the gem's hiding place actually works well for once!<br><br>The pieces were absolutely great! The silver claws are brilliant; absolutely wonderful for MOCing. The set also includes awesome new hoods for the Hassansins, which look wonderful on the minifigs. Dastan's sword holder is also very cool; the first Lego sheath ever! Dastan's hair is also really cool; another wonderful MOCing piece. The Hassansin's faces are also absolutely wonderfully done.<br><br>I was very pleased with what came with the set. For the first time in a long time, we've got a ten dollar set that actually includes a horse, two animals, two gems, four figures, AND a bunch of new custom weapons!<br><br>The figures are also amazingly detailed. From custom weapons to custom faces to extremely well done, printed bodies, these figures completely make the set.<br><br>The playability of the set is about as expected from a set this size. After a few times, the set itself gets old (though using the minifigs for other sets never gets old). However, if added to a larger set like the Battle of Alamut, this set will never get old.<br><br>My only cons to the set would be:<br><br>1. The claws and Dastan's sword are made out of cheap, chinese plastic, instead of the quality plastic of older Lego sets.<br>2. Personal preference, but in the movie, the snakes that the Hassansins uses are black, not red. But again, not a problem, just preference...<br>3. Too expensive for its amount of pieces. I mean, normally I wouldn't complain about something like this, but $11 for 67 pieces? That's almost 20 cents a piece!<br><br>Overall, this set is absolutely amazing. If you're on the edge about it, then get it. Even if you don't like the Prince of Persia line, get it, because the figures are absolutely worth it.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model built up in this set is a small piece of desert scenery, featuring some great new colors for existing pieces, the desert themed bush is a piece more commonly found in green. The color in this set is more of a dark tan and looks quite good. There is very little playability with this set, you can hide some jewels beneath a portion of the desert. That's pretty much it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You recieve four Mini-Figures in this set, one of which is a bit of a cop out really on LEGO's part, instead of giving us four unique characters from the PoP film we get one standard LEGO Skeleton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prince Dastan is the same Mini-Fig found in just about all of the PoP sets, this time around however he has his horse, which really bumps up the value on the set as the horse in question has a unique body printing and a light blue/teal saddle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hassassins are, according to the Mini-Fig browser, called Gahzab and Setam, Gahzab wields a large double-bladed battleaxe built like the Dwarve axes from the Fantasy Era Castle sets. He has a double-sided torso print resembling the armor he wears in the film, his head print is also quite unique, with a large brown patch covering one eye. As well as a beard and mustache and grim look, plus a few red lines to represent scars from previous battles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setam also has a double-sided torso print, the back showing his armor the front featuring his armor and six daggers, or bladed throwing weapons attached to the front. He also wears a nice new spiked shoulder piece and carries two triple-bladed claw weapons. (The set includes an extra one, giving you three of this unique new Mini-Fig weapon.) His facial print also has a few red scars, a much thicker beard and mustache. Both Hassassins include the new turban hat piece as well in black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, as far as Battle Packs go in Licensed Themes the Desert Attack is a very good bargain for your dollar, it includes three unique Mini-Figures and a horse, a red snake and black scorpion for your dangerous animal collection and throws in some great desert themed pieces. Plus two extra spears in a darker brown tone than we're used to seeing. My only complaint with the set is that instead of including a fourth PoP character to help Dastan against the Hassassins they cheap out and give us a tried and tired Skeleton Mini-Fig.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4

<p>Nice desert scene that it could also be used as a secret vault, made it my castle&#39;s vault, I also did it in a corner shape, and I liked it much better that way</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have my own imaginary, so I combined it with my only castle 6085, as an outdoor secret vault, and I loved making it in a corner shape much more than a straight scenery, price was too high for a small set, maybe because its a 2010 set and I got it in Feb 2015.</p>
