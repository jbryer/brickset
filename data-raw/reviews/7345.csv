Almost everything about the set is great.<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; Minifigs</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, Dastan is really neat, since he comes with the muscle torso and katana holder. The outer katana is loose, and sometimes a sword there will fall out. The ostrich rider has a very nice front and back torso print, a new face, and a rare bandana (if thats even the right word). Sheik Amar has nice front and back torso printing too, and the dark tan head wrap. The ostriches are just plain awesome! Their heads can swivel and be taken off.&nbsp;</p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; Parts / Build</h4><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; The weapons stand is kind of an odd add on. It does include an unwound Indy whip though! The podium does have some very nice pieces, such as a pearl gold fence and flag. Those were both a little too simple. The starting gate is the best part! Two Dark tan large plates, four dark tan 2X2 jumper plates, dark tan slopes, dark tan droid arms, and dark tan 2X2 plates are all included. You pull back on the tan slope to open the doors. The ostrich only fits on one of the jumper plates at a time.</div><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You should buy this set first time you lay your eyes upon it! 5/5</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4

The main building thing you get as well as the nice minifigs and cool ostriches is the ostrich race gate, which has an excellent and clever&nbsp;opening mechanism, but otherwise is ... well, it's just an opening race gate thing isn't it. The other two built things are fine and you get some nice pieces. So, this is good, and would be great to&nbsp;play with&nbsp;alongside other Prince of Persia sets. The whole series looks very nice.

"davy_jones","2010-06-10T11:02:01.5Z","No regrets here","<p>Sometimes we spend a hefty sum on some thing and then regret doing so for the financial logic. No such regrets here and certainly no need to turn back time to undo the purchase of this set.</p>
<p>I absolutely love it. It has three main sections with a lot of accessories thrown in for good measure. It cost slightly cheaper than the 'Loot Island' Pirate set in my country with a 10% discount but I realised it has more parts and simply looks more resolved.</p>
<p>When I spend so much on something i want to have some gimmick, and here i love the opening gates. New ostriches are great and can be incorporated into some other zoo or safari theme.</p>
<p>It gets a full 5 for full satisfaction. However we live in a capitalist economy and we'll always want more. I wish this set had a the Dagger of Time!</p>
<p>One more thing, I hope Lego never skimps on quality no matter what happens. It better to be expensive, than to have an expensive damage on your reputation which sometimes is irrecovarable. So far Lego has held up. Do so for a long time more...</p>

"benjadude11","2010-05-27T19:18:39.28Z","Ostriches!... and then what?","This is my fourth POP set (I don't have Quest Against Time) and my 3rd favorite. You're probably like, WHAT!?!?, but to tell the truth, this set doesn't have a whole lot more besides the one obvious pro. (Ostriches.)&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b>&nbsp;The set has two bad figs and one good one. The ostrich jockey has a repeat head (Hassasin in Battle of Alamut) and shirt (Asoka and market guy in Fight For the Dagger) and totally generic pants. The doo-rag saves this guy from being absolutely pitiful. Dastan is fine. He has a bare chest which I already have one of and his regular pants and swords. Sheik Amar, however, is FABULOUS. His robe is totally new and has printing on the front and the back! his pants are an unusual color, and he has that great turban. I haven't seen one of those since professor Quirrell back in the day. His face is good too, except its double sided. All in all, I guess, the figs kind of average out to even.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Ostriches: </b>The ostriches are good. they are slightly smaller than they look, but thats okay. Their bodies are plastic and one piece. Their heads/necks are a separate piece that can swivel and is made of a rubbery substance. They have four studs on their backs. Only negative: they don't stand up well, and are especially tippy with a rider. They are also, now that I think about it, useless for MOCing. When am I ever going to need an ostrich?</div><div><br></div><div><b>Gate/Tower:&nbsp;</b>The little viewing thing for Sheik Amar does it's job fine, with nothing mildly remarkable aside from the semi-rare circular pole pieces. (The brown ones in the front.) The gate is okay. There are a whole lot of little brown cones and poles, but thats not really an issue. the issue is that someone in the lego company got a little trigger happy with the new 2x2 dark tan one stud plates. There are two of them for each ostrich to stand on. So? you say-- but wait-- the ostriches don't actually fit! The plates are too far apart! D'OH! The gate has an opening mechanism which is clever, but unnecessary. You pull back a part in the back of the gates and both gates fling open simultaneously. It works very well, but I say it's unnecessary because after you open the gates, the ostriches are still just standing there on the ill-fitting dark tan plates. It's still a plus, though.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall: </b>Lackluster building experience and no real benefits other than ostriches&nbsp;hold this set back. <b>7.5/10</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"Firox_5000","2010-08-26T15:48:38.497Z","The first ever lego ostrich","<p>I bought this at Toys r us&nbsp; for £11.99 saving £3.&nbsp; In the set you get three figures one of them is&nbsp;Dastan with a new&nbsp;chest printed torso as well as a nice new mould to store his swordss. You also get a henchmen and&nbsp;&nbsp;another one with a turban. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also get a stand where the turban figure watches the race which has a red flag on the left and a golden one on the right.&nbsp; There is also a cage area were the gates open for the ostriches to come out and race as well as a weapon storage thing included too. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But those features are not what makes the greatness of this set as this is achieved by this prouduct including brand new never made before Lego ostriches. The ostriches are quite small but can hold a person on top. They are very well detailed on the sides and back and their heads can also come off aswell as rotating 360 degree's.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

They are mainly black, but he has a gold belt where his legs meet torso, and on one side of his leg is this silver design and on the other is a red ribbon or rope or something. I'm not sure, I just know its one of those.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><i>Torso:</i><b style=""font-style: italic; "">&nbsp;</b>He is shirtless, of course. So you can see all the details of his chest. He's got tons of muscles, like Superman (that would be a cool theme). Its basically all the details of a male's chest. It is skin-tone, of course.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Head: </i>Like many fans of Lego love to note, his head looks like Indiana Jones. He's got lots of stubble and thick black eyebrows. One side of his face is normal, like's he's happy, while one side is more for battle, like he's growling. He has nice brown hair that is long and messy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><i>Swords and Sword Holder: </i>He has two normal silver Ninja swords that fit into this cool sword holder that is designed so they make an X when in it. The sword holder is brown and shaped like a small x but is hollow inside, and you can see inside it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Sheik Amar:&nbsp;</b></div><div><i>Legs: </i>I like his legs. They aren't fancily designed with lots of stuff, but just one solid color. Its sandy colored, like the desert, a nice tan. Very nice color.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Torso: </i>His torso has lots of detail, and has back-printing. Up front he is wearing a vest or jacket that is sandy-colored as well with lots of lines to show age, and at the end of it, some red designs. He is earing this white shirt&nbsp;underneath with lots of lines to show&nbsp;untidiness like it needs to be ironed. He has a big belt that is dark purple with this circle in it. He is wearing a string necklace with a silver talisman on it. On the back of his torso he is very in need of a new shirt. Lots of patches that were sewn on and they're different colors. Some zig-zagging blue lines and brown patches. His sleeves are sandy-colored with flesh-arms.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><i>Head: </i>He has lots of black hair on his face, a big beard with side-burns. He has a big mustache and thick eye-brows with some red scratches. One is underneath his mouth, one is underneath his right eye, the other in the middle of his forehead. He comes with an awesome turban. I know turbans aren't very common, and I don't think there has been one since the first Harry Potter sets with Quirrel, but&nbsp;I could be wrong. Designed so it looks like cloth with plenty of bumps and a space for his face. it has a small hole for some reason, as if his forehead needs to breath....weird. One side of his face is this greedy smile, the other is a scared expression, like he lost a bet. His face is in this geat zig-zag expression.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Ostrich Jockey:</b></div><div>(I'm tired, I've never spent so much time on the Minifigures...)</div><div><br></div><div><i>Legs: </i>He has coffee brown legs, a very nice color, and I'm glad its not sandy colored, I think there's enough in the set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><i>Torso: </i>He has a sandy-colored jacket with&nbsp;lots&nbsp;of lines to represent wrinkles. It has plenty of gold buttons. Underneath you get a light blue shirt with a rip. He also has this nice blue cloth belt with some wrinkles. On the back you see how his jacket is kept together with buttons, and you can also see some of his light blue belt. His arms are cool, they are a light sand color with flesh hands.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><i>Head: </i>He also has some stubble or 5 o'clock shadow with a&nbsp;mischievous look. He is grinning and his eyebrows are raised&nbsp;at the ends. He has lots of red cuts on his face. Two are&nbsp;underneath&nbsp;his eyes, one under his mouth, another above an eyebrow. He wears a black cap, with&nbsp;lots&nbsp;of wrinkles and bumps, and a tail at the back. It's a nice ragged hat.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now for the set itself....</div><div><br></div><h4>Set:&nbsp;</h4><div><br></div><div><b>Stands: </b>It's an ice raised platform. A small sandy 'baseplate' with some pillars and rocks to support the stands itself. There is a small gate with a tiny gold fence piece, a 1x4, with some brown pieces&nbsp;along&nbsp;with it. There is enough room for a Minifigure or two. There is also a couple flags, one red, one gold.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Weapon Holder: </b>It's a nice addition, to represent how Sheik Amar would chase Dastan and try to hunt him down. There is four holders, one holds an ax, one has a whip, and the last two hold nice silver spears. The whip is cool, because it is flexible and moves. The ax is nice and&nbsp;silver, but nothing fancy. The two spears are just light gray with good points at the end. Nothing special. There is also a small green plant.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Ostrich Gates: </b>They're nice, but they're also the biggest problem. It's so fragile! And a little hard to play with.&nbsp;Anyways, you get two identical sections. Nice gate pieces on the side and on the inside is one of those 4x4 pieces with just one stud piece in the middle. They're nice and tan. The two gates in front also have nice designs, and i love the use of brown and tan pieces. There is a device that opens the two gates in the middle. I like how they swing open. You have to push this one device that somehow opens the gates.</div><div><br></div><div>There is also three animals. You get one regular scorpion that has a nice black color. Then there is the ostriches.&nbsp;</div><div>The ostriches have nice long pinkish legs with two 'toes' on each leg. The body has this feather design, with a couple white feathers in the back. There is four stud pieces for a Minifigure to sit. The pink head comes off and has this beak and big eyes and a white pupil. You get two, of course.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h4>Overall:</h4><div>I really can't believe I wrote all that on a 20 dollar set. It's an Okay set, not a must-have for most Lego fans, unless you really like Prince of Persia or Pharaoh's Quest, and maybe the swords are good for Ninjago fans. It's good, could be better, but still worth the buy. Harry Potter fans will also like how there are many brown sticks, just like wands.

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-03T17:46:16.817Z","LEGO Ostriches! 200th Review on Brickset","<p>Set #7570 The Ostrich Race: I wanted to do something spectacular for my 200th review on Brickset, but then I realized this is suitably spectacular as far as LEGO Sets go and also I should weed out a few more sets I own before working on the ones I gave away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This breaks up my Bionicle Reviews, but unfortunately that's the way the numbering turned out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the set: LEGO's new partnership with Disney has begun to expand their ideas and parts inclusion quite impressively. Toy Story has given us some unique looking and fun to play with sets and Mini-Figures and on the flip side, the Prince of Persia sets have introduced a new aspect to any Egyptian or Desert themed display in our LEGO collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have plans to pick up all six sets released at Retail for this Theme before they dissapear completely, but I nabbed this one first when it was on sale a couple of weeks ago for two very important reasons. At 13$ and change you really can't go wrong with this set and it is a LEGO set that introduces a new LEGOized version of an animal we don't typically see from LEGO, the Ostrich.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model itself is small, much smaller than you'd expect from a box this size. It includes one weapons rack for the two spears and the axe included with this set. A grandstand/observation platform for the Sheik to stand and watch his races. And the starting gate, which uses the Droid Arm piece in a clever way to activate the gimmic of the gates being opened and THEY'RE OFF!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set includes three Mini-Figures. Dastan who is shirtless for some reason though at this point in the movie he never actually took his shirt off. The Sheik in charge of the Ostrich Races played by the same actor who portrayed Doctor Octopus (Making him one of the only actors to recieve a LEGO Mini-Figure of three characters he's played in three different films, Doctor Octopus, the Sheik and Saitpo from Indiana Jones.) And an Ostrich Racer or Race Overseer. (Don't have the official names in front of me, but I have a rough idea of what he's supposed to be.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sheik includes a new colored turban and a dual-sided head, he also has a double sided torso I believe. The Ostrach Racer/Race Overseer also has a double-sided torso, but only a single sided head. He also comes with a whip accessory that looks like Indy's whip only not curled up. Dastan comes with his special topless torso (Not Double-Sided.) a unique sword holder for his two blades and a dual-printed head. One side happyish the other determined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this is one of the best offings from the new Prince of Persia Theme of LEGO. It has a lot of interesting and unique pieces, it includes two ostriches for your LEGO Menagerie and one of the only two Mini-Figures to be topless, the other being the German Mechanic from Fight on the Flying Wing...(That was the Indy Set's name, right?) If you can snap this one up don't let it slip through your fingers, even better if you can get it on sale because as far as I'm concerned this set's piece count to dollar value is a little on the iffy side. Strongly Recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The minifigs included are pretty neat.&nbsp; These are my first licensed figs since the change from yellow to flesh tones, so they got a few extra points for me on that basis, but even putting that aside, the printed torsos, the headgear and the accessories included impress.</li><li>Ostriches!&nbsp; I bet you thought I'd lead with the ostriches.&nbsp; I'm a fan of ostriches, in general -- they're interesting looking animals, and the multi-color models included here really capture their look.</li><li>I love the mechanism that opens and closes the gates on the ostrich stalls.&nbsp; It doesn't depend on rubber bands, which seems to make it a bit more reliable than the gate mechanism in Set 8061, Gateway of the Squid.&nbsp; Further, the visible parts of the mechanism match the over-all color scheme, so it blends right into the model.<br></li><li>I like the general color scheme of the bricks and other pieces in this set.&nbsp; The gray, brown and tan are more subdued than the bright color schemes I was accustomed to.&nbsp; I realize that this is a function of the desert setting, but I'm starting to give some real consideration to putting together some pre-modern themed MoCs, and the color scheme at work here inspires me.</li><li>The set includes quite a few non-standard bricks and other bits that could easily prove useful for MOC projects, particularly the brown poles and cones, used to great effect in this set to build fencing and gates.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The studs on the jumpers that make up the floor of the ostrich stalls not only do not align with the ostriches' feet, they are positioned such that if one foot is attached to one stud, you have to either turn the ostrich a bit so that he's not facing forward and ready to race or have him sort of leaned up on the misaligned stud such that he faces forward but doesn't stand very well.&nbsp; This flaw frustrates the set's value as a diorama.<br></li></ul>
<p>This is just an excellent set.&nbsp; It was a fun build with a clever mechanism for the gates, solid minifigs and (need I mention?) ostriches.&nbsp; I'm giving serious thought to going ahead and picking up an extra copy or two of this set for parts (and ostriches) in the hope that I eventually get around to designing and building that castle I keep dreaming of.&nbsp; If I run across a few copies at discount, it's all but a done deal.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5

"Mystical_Møøse","2017-07-25T14:15:33.93Z","Ostriches, and that's it","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Bog-standard push tab, play features on the back box. Instructions are similarly uninteresting, left loose in the box, but they both do the job.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>We get three decent minifigures: Dastan, an Ostrich Jockey, and Sheik Amar. The most notable of these is Dastan, due to his rather rare bare chest, which is great to find at this price point. What is interesting to note is that while his head appears to be the same on the box as Indiana Jones&#39;, it is, in fact, different, which was a nice surprise. The jockey works well as a generic minifigure, but is nothing special. However, his black cap is relatively uncommon. The same can be said for Amar&#39;s turban, which is only available in one other set. His torso and face are unique to this set. His robe features some patchwork on the back, unlike the pristine front.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Obviously, the main attraction to this set is the ostriches, which are made of two components; a rubbery head, and a hard body, with four studs for a minifigure to sit on. Overall, they&#39;re quite fun, although unfortunately, presumably to keep it stable when standing, the feet are comically large. There&#39;s not much else to note other than the space skeleton arms in dark tan, which are only available in one other set. Overall, the selection of pieces isn&#39;t bad, just not special really. It has a reasonable price per piece ratio in the UK (8.9p), but in the US it&#39;s above TLG&#39;s average of 11.8c.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Build</h3>

<p>Fairly simple over all, nothing really interesting to note other than the 1x6 plates which rest on only one stud each at the top of the gate. However, I did not find that this compromised the structure&#39;s strength.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p>My only real complaint with this set is it&#39;s main function: the gate. I have three issues with it: firstly, that the mechanism itself isn&#39;t near as smooth as it should be. The clip hinges provide a lot of resistance when pulled. Secondly, there is no convenient place to hold it when the gate is pulled back, which makes it quite fiddly to do. Thirdly, attempting to pull back the gate is quite likely to allow the ostriches to tumble over, as their feet seem to have very little grip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the other parts of the model are fine, and the railing on the platform is rather attractive. The weapons stand is unremarkable, but functional.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>To be honest, I feel like I&#39;m being a bit harsh on this set. It&#39;s nice enough and has some good pieces and minifigures, but the gate section is, quite frankly, awful. Overall, I&#39;d probably give it a 4/10. If you find it for cheaper, it&#39;s possibly worth it, but honestly even then I&#39;d probably skip it.</p>
