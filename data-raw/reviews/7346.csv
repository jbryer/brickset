<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigs: I love these minifigs! My fave's are Dastan and Asoka. So lets review EACH of them! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dastan: I love the new hair piece they put on him. And to some people who think its Indys head well they slightly changed it. The <strong>BEST</strong> part is the thing on his back that holds his swords! The only thing is that if you have the swords in and you try to seat him, well... it does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Princess Tamina: 1st off I didn't know that her hair was long in the back. It never shows in any pictures so I thought it was short. But the hair is still awesome. And ah yes, the white cape. Its nothing that&nbsp;special, but hey, its there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asoka: Man that golden armor rocks!&nbsp;I love that they did not put any red marks on this face to mess it up. He has the same body as the Alamut Merchant but most of it is coverd up so who cares!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alamut Merchant: Um... He has a knife, a cool head, and a head thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok I'm done with the Minifigs so lets move on to&nbsp;the set and its parts!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fruit cart: To me its a waste of bricks so I took it apart. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camel: Its a new lego animal! So I guess It is used for work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Table: Its a TABLE! so move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Main temple thing: Gold! Lots and lots of gold pieces! Ok so lets see... oh yes. The trap door is very nice but it is not even with the floor. The path way is nice and steady. And its always nice to have stairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall: 4/5</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Legoragon","2010-04-14T01:43:49.437Z","The fight for the... CAMEL!","this set is quite interesting. despite the lack of a real well made building it does have a nice appearance and awesome new elements. The camel.... amazing, the back sheath thingy....incredible, the merchant's hat... cool and the camel.... EPIC ( i know i said camel twice.) Another cool feature of this set is the new elements that are everywhere; for example the 2x2 flat plates with bump in the middle,the dome elements, the whip (untwisted), the white cape and the camel. A few things about this set that i don't like are the excessive use of trapdoors and also the gold guy... his helmet may look cool in the picture but it is much to tall for the person. So that's about it (there's a camel too in case you didn't notice)<br>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4
"David1971","2010-05-09T15:48:36.357Z","Unusually beautiful!","<p>This is a lovely set. These Prince of Persia sets are a really nice theme. I don't know if the movie will be any good - that doesn't really matter. At least it means we have these great, very well designed sets. They are not like some&nbsp;hastily-produced movie tie-in. Each one seems to have been very thoughtfully designed, and it is so nice to see a different kind of Middle Eastern architecture in Lego. This one is very pretty, with the lovely gold dome and other very nice building features (as well as reasonably clever trap doors). The minifigs are great, including a nice female one (Princess Tamina), and the man in golden armour is also highly unusual! And as well as all that, you get a camel (a camel!!), a generous supply of apples and cherries, plus torches, plants, fish, etc. This is all really nice. Since this building was so delightful, alas I now have a strong desire for set #7573, Battle of Alamut, the really super big building, as well. These are good sets and better value than the Star Wars sets - Jerry Bruckheimer must be somewhat less demanding than George Lucas!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"ProofR","2010-05-02T19:26:36.403Z","Great set! Many accesories and interesting stuff","<p>This set is pretty good. In contains 258 pieces. And every piece is worth. You get 4 minifigures.&nbsp;Dastan, Princess Tamina, a market seller and Asoka.&nbsp;All of them pretty good and 2 are exclusive to this set. You get many more stuff of course. </p>
<p>You get the main building. A camel with boxes. A car. A table... and a lot of interesting pieces. For example the golden dome pieces, the food, the camel, the flames. And for me dark tan and nougat color look very good, and I love them. If you want to make an arabian diorama, this set is an essential definitively. </p>
<p>You also get a lot of accesories. A turkey leg, 2 fishes, 6 cherries, apples, 2 katanas, a katana holder for Dastan, 1 spear, 1 dagger of time.</p>
<p>Here are my pros and cons:</p>
<p>Pros: </p>
<ul>
<li>4 good minifigures 
<li>Camel, flames, food, diamonds, white cape for Tamina 
<li>New interesting pieces and colors</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trapdoor doesnt works so well 
<li>A little bit expensive</li></ul>
<p>Ok. I love this set! Oh, and if you are mexican like me, and you wanna know its cost, it is 550 pesos. Of course, it depends of the store you buy it on.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"benjadude11","2010-04-25T13:31:39.217Z","booby traps that work","I got this set instead of ostrich race because a) it is bigger and b) I thought it had more opportunities for MOCing and better playability. I will do my review in parts:<div><b><br></b></div><div><b>The Minifigs:</b>&nbsp;Four minifigs is good for a $30 set, five if you count the camel, and they are all very cool. Dastan has his awesome cross sheath for his swords and his usual unique hair. (or maybe it's not so unique now that I have three.) The market seller guy has a nice printed torso and great white head robe thingy. he also has two knives. Princess Tamina is nice also with the white cape. I give lego credit for not using the two by two slant piece as a dress like they normally do with girls. It limits mobility and makes them too tall. Last but not least is Asoka, the gold guy. His torso underneath his breastplate is the same as the market guy's (yup, lego cheaped out again) but it really isn't an issue, because you can't see it. His face is bearded and looks mean without being evil.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Tower: </b>The tower/walkway really aren't that big, but they are cool anyway. The tower has two great booby trapped parts to it, too. the balcony falls and so does the floor on the second story. Neither mechanism is particularly complicated, but that's perfectly fine because they work so smoothly. I also love the dome.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Accessories:</b>&nbsp;The fish and fruit stand is really superbly done. I did not previously have either apples or cherries, so I'm excited by those, and their generous quantities. (3 apples, 5 cherries.) I also like the dagger of time, but my favorite is the camel's baskets. They are so good looking with the one stud 4x4 plate.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall:</b>&nbsp;At the end of the day this is a great set, if a little bit expensive. but then again, all sets are too expensive. Buy this set. Think of it this way: Ostrich might be a delicacy, but it really is tough and bland. Apples and cherries are always sweet and delicious.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"SpiderMana","2010-05-22T11:07:11.607Z","Just blew my B-day/Grad money! :p","<h4>Fight For the Dagger-</h4>-is a great set. I also own Battle of Alamut and the Ostrich Race set (which I haven't opened), and this one seems to fit in well. I bought this mostly for the minifigs: another Dastan can't really hurt, Tamina has a great new hairpiece and another decent peach girl face, Asoka has a nice new (to me, at least) face, the new golden armor, and last: the Alamut Merchant. This guy unfortunately has the same face as one of the figs from Alamut, but his headgear makes up for that. It really goes well with Tamina's cape.<br><br>Thus, I'd rate the minifigs: 5/5 (You are getting two of the same shirt from Asoka and the Merchant: the one from the ostrich race, but it's a great one for making random Persian Minifigs.)<br><br>Now the accessories. The weapons are nice, but when you already own two daggers of time, plenty of silver spears, and six torches, they become a shadow. The really nice parts are the food and the whip. Having Three apples (no biggie, I already own four-ish), SIX red cherries (I had just gotten two from Pick-a-Brick.. lucky me.), and two fish (YEY! My first ones!). The whip is also nice, and you could use it when Indy's grabbing something with his whip! (I own about eight Indy sets... and thus eight Indy whips.)<br><br>Accessories: 4.5/5<br><br>The Build/Pieces: This build is relatively simple, but I like it. The two traps right next to each other is nice, but almost a bit too much. The pieces, though: the pieces are great. Lots of Dark Tan and the new color, and the Camel, though great, is Dark Tan, which makes it awesome. :)<br><br>Pieces: 5/5 (For the Camel!!)<br><br>Playability: Fine... the trap door usually works and the balcony will always fall. The only problem is that they need a bush on the end of the pin to keep the trap door level. But really nothing amazing<br><br>Playability: 4.5/5<br><br>And the Price: Decent for the 'fig amount and the Camel and the pieces, but Lego rarely has great prices.<br><br>Price: 4/5<br><br>Overall: 4.5/5<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set includes Dastan with a nice new sword holder mould on the back, Princess tamina who can have either a happy or serious face, a guard with gol armour and market seller with chicken and knife in his hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the main strucutre of the set consists of wha looks like a small market scene which has tradional steps on the left with a medium lenghed thin path way which leads up to a small open building. The lower level is empty while the top has some nice new quarter dome pieces which are a shiny gold colour. The middle floor has a red soft roof on the left with a new flame piece on the front. The middle floor also has two traps. The pole at the back releases the balcony if pushed out while the one on the right drops the floor if pulled out. </p>

<p>The set also includes a never done before lego camel. The camel is a really nice addition and is certainly cool and a high demand just like the ostriches. The camel is carrying two containers. One with cherries and the other with gems inside. There is also a small market stall,wagon with fruit and a thing you put the camel on which is practically useless really. </p>

<p>The build takes probably 30/35 minutes and is quite straight forward mostly. the set is quite durable as for it's size it has a lot of features as mentioned above.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model represents a building, I'm not sure from which city in the movie, but it has a lot of great building techniques to make it look like a piece of an old Persian marketplace. I especially like the way they make the roof of the small building and the fact that this set includes a single piece staircase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also includes the new LEGO Camel, a great and cheap way to get it as opposed to picking up the Battle of Alamut. You also get a few Green Apples and Red Cherries. Plus a Turkey leg and one of the new Fish pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures in this set are some of the best, there is the ever present hero of Persia, Prince Dastan, we've seen him before. His brother however, Asoka is only available in this set, wearing a pearl toned armor and helmet pieces, the helmet is all new in this Theme and great for MOCing purposes. Underneath his armor he features a double-sided torso piece, it isn't a unique torso piece however as it is shared by the Alamut Merchant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Princess Tamina is the fourth and final Mini-Figure, wearing all white, with a white cloth cape and a great torso print, she also has a double-sided head and a unique hair piece that LEGO has recently brought back into other Theme sets. (I've seen it in a Bricks and More Set from 2012.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a lot of great weapons in this set, a spear for Asoka, Dastan's twin swords, the Merchant's carving knives (you get two) and of course, the titular Dagger of Time. This unique weapon isn't going to be seen again I'd wager, and it is a great new weapon for LEGO Mini-Figures to wield, with an impressive sculpt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say that all of the LEGO Prince of Persia sets are really great and worth owning for any LEGO fans, this one includes a lot of nice new pieces and a great build complete with play gimmicks, a trap door floor and a collapsing balcony, plus this set is the cheaper of the two to feature the new LEGO Camel.
