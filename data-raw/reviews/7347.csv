"Worker_Joe","2010-03-25T08:52:16.077Z","Another great PoP set!","<p>This is another great PoP set [the first was desert attack]. I picked it up yesterday and I am so happy I did. LEGO put in 2 time daggers instead of 1! The set came with new pieces that I really enjoyed using and building with. If you are looking for cool pieces or Prince of Persia minifigs, this is the set!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>-Nazim and Zalm [The only set to get Zalm so far!]</p>
<p>-Princess Tamika [Cool hair piece!]</p>
<p>-Traps that work well</p>
<p>-Time Dagger!</p>
<p>-Easy to build [but 2 instruction books.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>-None-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very sastified with this set. It had the prince and other awesome pieces! I would tell all my friends about this set.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5
"sudorum","2010-04-11T18:28:27.653Z","Beware the instructions","THere is a certain problem in this set that others may or may not encounter. THe instructions. Of the two put in the package, the first one was faulty. Pages 1-28 were all there, but then the next pages feature reprints of 23-28. After the reprint comes page 41-46, then reprints of 41-46,after which the regular numbering of 47-61 resumes. I ended up having to look at the online directions supplied at lego.com for pages 29-40.Despite this annoying set back, the set itself is quite decent. Loads of new, rare minifigs, swords, and ""combo"" piece, which is where two flat 2x2 pieces are combined into one 2x4. THe front part of the set features falling blades and saws, thanks to two sliding pieces that apply pressure to the bases of the saw and blades. This feature is completely made up and is not in the movie at any time. Set also features a falling scythe similar to the rolling boulder indiana jones set. The light-up &nbsp;system is also a great feature, being brighter than I had anticipated. Not a let-down set, despite the instruction deformities. Buy it!",FALSE,4,5,1,5,4
"desire4one","2010-07-04T17:30:08.37Z","Sands of Time...or Sith Temple","<p>I default almost all lego sets back the be all end all of Star Wars.&nbsp; This set is great for what is intended.&nbsp; It's also great for a certain Jedi training site.&nbsp; I bought this set during a buy one get one sale and was pleasantly surprised.&nbsp; Overall the set is great for the value.&nbsp; One of the only decently priced sets I've seen in quite some time.&nbsp; For anyone looking for gray/stone pieces, a light up piece, cool arabian figs or new weapons, this is it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The set features the first light up piece I've ever seen.&nbsp; It's decently bright and could go in just about any set.</li>

<li>Alot of gray pieces for construction/rock formations.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Great base pieces.</li>
<li>A new damsel in distress.</li></ul>
<p>For the first time, I don't have anything bad to say about this set.&nbsp; If your a hobbyist or loyal lego builder this set is a must have.&nbsp; The younger folks will like the playability in the set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Brickman_oo_","2010-10-06T06:44:05.61Z","Fun for one day! Then never fun again.","This set (as I said in the title) is fun for a day, but then you never want to play with it again.

"AETerry","2011-01-23T20:56:36.71Z","Quest Against Time Review","<p>In many ways, this set reminded me of some of the Indiana Jones sets that Lego did. I can see some extended play and cross over with Indiana Jones into the Prince of Persia with this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is built largely in two parts. The first part features a lot of booby traps to keep people away from where the Dagger and Sands of Time are at. The second part is set higher up to try and recreate the scenes where characters climbed. There's lighted pieces so when you push the Dagger in, the light turns on, causing all these transparant pieces to glow or light up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not bad for the intents of this set to recreate a scene, four minifigures based on characters from the movie complete it out. So it ends up being a very good set up that's made in the end.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"bluelion3","2012-11-29T09:58:04.43Z","Less than the sum of its parts","A forgettable set from a forgettable movie.&nbsp; <br><br>The set consists of a series of deadly obstacles for our hero on his way
 to the top.&nbsp; Flick the levers to swing blades or a trap door.&nbsp; The 
intended path is narrow, so it can be tricky for actual play because 
it's hard to hold a minifigure in the small spaces under the arch or between the blades.&nbsp; Along with its minimal playability, it's not attractive enough to be a display set.<br><br>The four minifigures (Dastan, Princess Tamina, Nizam, and Zolm), are all well done and have nice parts to use for creating new figs.&nbsp; However, none of them are particularly valuable for resale.&nbsp; Put Zolm's cape on Nizam and he looks like a wicked wizard.&nbsp; <br><br>There is a light brick which illuminates a wall of trans-yellow bricks with dramatic effect.&nbsp; This was the first section I built.&nbsp; It's not very playable, but it's fun to light up now and then.&nbsp; <br><br>The parts are useful for castle MOCs.&nbsp; You get a variety of slopes and arches in dark bluish grey and medium nougat.&nbsp; <br><br>I bought this set on sale from Amazon.com (US) when it was discounted roughly 50% to $24.91.&nbsp; My young son (3yo) enjoys it, so it was a OK price for playing rather than collecting.&nbsp; The value for the money based on the retail price of $49.99 is pretty low when you take into account playability and collectibility.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,2,4,3,2,2
"Harmonious_Building","2012-12-18T14:23:16.673Z","It's a trap! And another trap!","I'm sure that I'm not the only one who thinks that Prince of Persia is a decidedly strange franchise to receive a LEGO version of, though it's also hard not to imagine that with Disney looking for a successor to its highly lucrative Pirates of the Caribbean films, they decided to run with Prince of Persia as their tentpole and attempted to market it in a similar way. The difference, of course, was while ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a decently entertaining movie, ""Sands of Time"" was pretty much the opposite of that.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I am no apologist for the movie - which I thought was awful - though I do have some vague memories of playing the original ""every step kills you"" Prince of Persia on the PC, and I did have a blast with 2003's ""The Sands of Time"" video game, which the movie is ostensibly (though not really) based on. For fans of the video games watching the movie, a large part of what was lost is that the titular Prince is an athletic wizard, skilfully dodging traps and leaping over pits - most of the time. These abilities were only vaguely exploited in the movie, and more as a half-gnawed bone to the fanbase than as an actual character trademark.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, so where am I going with this, you ask? That was the windup, and here is the pitch: someone at LEGO apparently had a better idea of what the Prince of Persia stands for, and thus we have a set whose scenario is only very loosely based on anything that was seen in the movie and a much more honest shout-out to anyone who likes the games. I have no love for the film whatsoever, but I bought this set all the same, simply because I was attracted to the idea of the Prince doing what he does best - dodging traps and getting out of trouble like only he can.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But that's not to say that I love everything about this set, and that's what we'll discuss now. You get four Minifigs here, which is pretty much the sum total of anything you would need for any plot: a hero, a girl, a bad guy, and a henchman (sorry for the latent sexism, but sadly that's still the state of the entertainment industry this days). The Minifigs are all fantastic, of course, and I particularly like the assassin guy's turban/hood. I'm hoping that these moulds will be reused in the future for Middle Eastern-themed Collectible Minifigs, because I think that would be awesome. Unfortunately, only the Prince and the bad guy come with any weapons, so you'll have to scrounge around your collection to find appropriate ones for the other two (I seriously don't even know their names and am way too lazy to pull out the box to look).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The set is divided into two parts that connect together with Technic pegs: the front half is a gauntlet of traps that our Prince must pass through, while the back is a desert chamber that has a bit more to do with the movie compared to the front, assuming you're concerned about that sort of thing. You can probably guess that I think that the front half is infinitely better than the back half. The traps are simple but very effective, and the giant rotating saw blade is exactly the kind of exaggerated (and highly anachronistic) danger that makes the games so much fun. There's little places for the Prince to balance himself as knives and blades and other deadly objects swing back and forth, and I really can't believe that the design team came up with this without the video games firmly in mind. It's a lot of fun and makes for great spectacle.</div><div><br></div><div>Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the back. While I can see the play potential for a largely open area where hero and villain can play hide-and-seek, the overall impression feels as though it's rather half-finished. A number of risky design choices also compromise the sturdiness of the construction, including a flat 2-by-12 stretched over just two 2-by-1 ""pillars"" on the ends. There is also the annoying use of modified 1-by-1 black bricks with a stud on one side where said stud is not used for anything. At minimum, I would have expected perhaps a grey cheese wedge to act as a ""grip"" for our acrobatic Prince, but even that was neglected.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The light-up structure at the top not particularly attractive either; it's a simple mishmash of slopes and trans-yellow bricks, although the light brick gimmick does function very well. It's a commendable use of ""basic"" bricks (which ironically seem harder and harder to come by nowadays), but it honestly feels as though not as much thought went into it. It's sad, because I think a couple of minor modification could have given this part a lot of great architectural flair - the Middle East is no stranger to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra"">buildings carved out of caves</a>, after all. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The final verdict is that I can probably only safely recommend this set to people are fans of the Prince of Persia video games. The Minifigs are charming in their own way and the gauntlet is a lot of fun, but the build is guaranteed to be too simple for experienced builders and the franchise too obscure for most newcomers (especially two years on and counting at the time of writing this). I guess the design is generic enough that the franchise-exclusive characters could be safely swapped out and replaced (Indiana Jones, maybe? Or Batman?), but that would pretty much defeat the purpose of the whole thing, wouldn't it?&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,3
"sideswinger","2019-12-02T18:20:26.09Z","A Nice, Fun, Set!","<p>So my brother got this set just before I was born, and once I was old enough I was able to find the scattered pieces and rebuild it with my dad. After that&nbsp; I played with it a lot and really enjoyed it. So, even though you can&#39;t buy it anymore, I&#39;m gonna give an in-depth look at this set!</p>

<p>1.Minifigures</p>

<p>SO the selection of figures here is pretty great. Everyone here looks nice, and I like how they included most of the characters from the film.</p>

<p>2.Building Experience</p>

<p>So the buildup here isn&#39;t terrible, but it;s not amazing either. it&#39;s just normal. It can be kind of tricky lining everything up, but if you just pay attention to the book, you can figure it out.</p>

<p>3.Parts.</p>

<p>So the parts here are pretty great, if you ask me. it has some nice face prints and hair pieces on the minifigures, and it has some other nice pieces too, like the trans-yellow bricks, the fire pieces, and of course, that big saw. It has some nice pearl gold pieces as well.</p>

<p>4.Playability</p>

<p>So the playability here is out of this world. You can pretend the characters are running through, dodging the traps, escaping, climbing, there&#39;s just so much fun to be had here, and I myself really enjoyed it when I was a kid too.</p>

<p>5.Value</p>

<p>I think the price tag of $50 bucks is great, because let&#39;s face it: If this was released in present day, it&#39;s probably be $70 to $80 dollars. I mean, 506 pieces is pretty good for the price.</p>

<p>So there you have it folks! A full review of this set. And I really think that this is an overall nice set, and an overall FUN set.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
