"parchioso","2010-04-05T03:10:31.763Z","The best value set in the theme","<p>This is indeed a very good set that I really&nbsp;appreciate a lot, I don't have any cons because the pricing is ok too, I see it as the set that gives the best ""price-performance"" in the Prince of Persian theme. </p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Excellent minifigs and creature - A complete masculine cast of 7 warriors + a Tan camel (the one in 7571 seems to be of a different color)</p>
<p>Great castle - very good Sand Orange like color + tan + white combination. Four sections linked together to form the complete structure. Beautiful golden dome!</p>
<p><br/>Rich parts inventory - A rich varieties of new or high value parts - nice door plates that look good from both sides, gold domes, smooth edge archs, and many others. And of course, the cool Dagger!</p>
<p>Excellent playability<br/>- hinged section linking <br/>- Nice Doors<br/>- The use of 1 x 4 stub bricks allows Dastan to ""walk"" on the wall<br/>- The retractable stairs is also very interesting!<br/>- Breaking door<br/>- Catapults<br/>- Oil pouring devices<br/>- The way the dagger is hidden and stored</p>
<p>All the other sets in the theme are also nice but they are too&nbsp;limited in&nbsp;content to&nbsp;fully express the unique culture behind the story line, and in terms of&nbsp;value&nbsp;for money I think 7573 is most worth it, this is a great set that I would strongly recommend!</p>

For once, lego has managed to come out with a set that's not so overpriced it leaves your wallet a desert. The minifigs are in themselves amazing. Seven minifigures-all new! The best feature would have to be Dastan's sword holder that fits on his back. Also has an all new camel!&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>As for the temple, it has its high notes too. The front section has two new style catapults, and barrels at the top that drop lava. The left side wall has a secret entrance, and the right wall has ""vanishing"" stairs. The back part of the temple has a gold scorpian and two gold cups. In the middle is a diamond that can be lifted up to reveal the dagger of time beneath it. The top floor has a weapons rack, a balcony, and a throne I'm assuming is for Nazim.

"benjadude11","2010-04-05T17:44:20.797Z","A Taj Mahal for Minifigs ","<p>This is one of the most amazing, perfect, ideal sets I have ever gotten. Ever. This is gonna be one massive review.&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Building Experience:</b>&nbsp;The set takes &quot;modular building&quot; to a whole new level. It comes in seven bags. Two for the gate and characters, one for each wall, and three for the domed section. I did it in two sittings and spent about two hours on it. The walls and gate are built first, and until you get the domed section behind them they look pretty lame, because the color scheme is bad without the white part in the back. But once you build the last section... wow.&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Parts:</b>&nbsp;Lots of new parts. The half arches and the pieces to build the dome are good and plentiful, and the new parts on the new minifigs are nice too. The colors are fabulous as well, with the new nougat color, plus the white, gold, and tan. It all looks very regal. Oh, and the camel. :)</div>
<div><b>Playability: </b>How can a set with seven figs <i>not</i>&nbsp;have good playability? The studded walls, pourable lava, sliding staircase and removable wall segment don't hurt either.</div>
<div><b>Value:</b>&nbsp;$80 is a lot yes, but check the piece count. 821. Thats about one piece for every ten cents. Now look at Star Wars's Home One Mon Calamari Cruiser. 789 pieces for $110. Just saying.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now I'll do a review of each individual part.</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Gate: </b>The first part you build, the gate is about 5 1/2 inches high. The doors are dark brown and are attached with clips. The gate is mostly nougat pieces, with hardly any white. This gives it a rougher, dirtier look than the rest of Alamut. it has a small balcony and two small catapults that throw one by ones quite well. The gate also has lava to pour upon Dastan's head. However, because of the spacing of the barrels and the minimal quantity of lava, this feature is not as dramatic as it sounds. All in all, I like the gate, except for the lava.&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Right Wall: </b>The right wall of the fort has steps that can slide in and out, allowing the minifig to descend the inside or outside. Either that or they are an Indy-esque trap. IDK. The movie will probably shed some light on that issue.</div>
<div><b>Left Wall: </b>The left wall of Alamut is, at a glance, identical to the right, except for the absence of the steps. It looks like a solid block of bricks. It isn't. There is a chunk that pops out. Again, I'm not sure exactly what the purpose of this is. It may be to collapse as Dastan's running across it, or it may be to break in or out of the fort. Again, the movie ought to answer that question.</div>
<div><b>The Domed Section: </b>This is one of the best elements to a Lego set that I have ever seen. Really, it is. It looks regal, grand, beautiful, strong, intricate and new. The level of detail is the reason for this. From the new half-arch pieces, to the gates used as ironwork in the walls, to the weapons rack and Nizam's throne, this set is amazing. The golden scorpion and wine glasses, plus the two balconies and ample arched pieces help as well to give this set it's distinctive look. It is like the Taj Mahal for minifigs. If for nothing else, buy this set for the dome. This section also contains the Dagger of Time's little holster thing beneath the ruby.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Overall: </b>This is the best set I've ever gotten. Period. It has no flaws and is worth the money of everyone who is capable to buy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

"grelb32","2010-07-10T12:10:39.293Z","One of the Best Sets Ever!","<p>I got this set for my birthday, and I absolutely love it! In my opinion, it's one of the best sets I own.<br />
<br />
The building experience starts with the front gate, which is kind of boring (except for building the lava dropping traps, which work excellently), and then moves onto the side walls, which, when compared to other larger castles, are quite nice to build, in that they don't take forever to put together. Then you get to the real building experience: the back. The back part of the palace is beautifully made, with a wonderful Persian design. However, I like it in that it is made out of actual blocks, and not a bunch of flat pieces stuck together.<br />
<br />
The new parts are amazing: Tamah's knife piece that he attaches to his left arm is incredibly movie accurate! Both of the Hassansin's faces are amazing, and the black wrap that Tamah wears is a wonderful new piece that works great for MOCing. The dagger of time is stunning too. Seso is just plain awesome, as are Nizam and Dastan. Dastan's sheath is very beautifully designed; the first ever sword sheath Lego has made! The golden scorpion was also a nice edition to the set. The camel was a brilliant piece too, though kind of a useless addition to a battle scene....<br />
<br />
The playability of the set is wonderful! My two year old sister loves it for the castle, my younger brothers love it for the awesome figures, and I love it overall! This set has provided many hours of playability for me and my brothers and sisters; all of us love it! The traps work flawlessly for once; I was quite pleased with the designs of all of them.<br />
<br />
The value for money is also quite good. I know that several people have complained about the size of it, saying that it's quite small. However, for $80, and at 820-some-odd pieces, it's not only a good price-to-piece ratio, but the size of about right for an eighty-dollar castle/fortress style set.<br />
<br />
My only complain would be that Tamah's hand weapons, Dastan's swords, the dagger of time, and Gool's weapons are all really soft plastic that gets scratched easily.<br />
<br />
Overall, I would suggest that you buy this set if you haven't, though I would suggest getting it on eBay for $50-$60 instead of paying the full amount for it. Even if you don't like Prince of Persia (or haven't seen it yet), I still would suggest it, as it has alot of awesome figures, and alot of playability (not to mention a really fun building experience).</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AETerry","2011-01-23T20:46:15.557Z","Battle of Alamut Castle Review","<p>Having finished putting this set -back- together, I am once again amazed by this set. It's the largest set in the Prince of Persia line and also the most expensive at $79.99 U.S. I won't complain of that price, not when I have a gift card and was able to finally go in to get it, only to find it was at a discount. Full price, I'd still have gotten this, and I understand those who wait for the sales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a grand total of seven minifigures in this set, five of them being specific characters from the Prince of Persia movie. A new camel mold and just tons of little details all fill this set out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire design makes me think of Persia, so it's great to have a Castle set that's not European based, features another culture outside of Oriental and Ninjago. Most of the best details come from building the back side of the castle with the gold domes and the interior details with the hidden spot for the Dagger of Time, throne, gold cups and gold scorpion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That the build is modular, makes it easier to assemble and work on the Castle by sections. Like many older classic Castles, the sides of the Alamut playset pop out to allow for easier access to inside the Castle grounds. A section of the walls can be pushed in for either a secret entrance or part of sieging the castle. Catapults on the front turrents, fire trap to drop down on those who break open the gates. A flame catapult from attackers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's just lots of details that make the price of picking this set up well worth, especially when there's extra pieces such as an extra Dagger of Time, set of hand claws for the one Hassien warrior. Dastan's sword holders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you didn't watch or play Prince of Persia and aren't familiar with it, this set can still be well worth it for having or featuring another culture in a Castle theme. It's just fantastic, just be careful of how you store it when bringing it back out later for display.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Ernst","2012-03-12T16:56:03.33Z","Lego's most gracefull Castle so far.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks :</strong> This is in my opinion Lego&#39;s most graceful Castle so far. With the wonderful colors and the Middle Eastern (ME) accents it is a feast for the eye, thanks to the great details. The minifigures in this set are just as good. This is the first set I got from this theme but no doubt more will follow now. If a Castle fan is in search for an alternative for LOTR sets I highly recommend this theme and this set in special.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks :</strong> building this Castle is big fun with&nbsp;loads of small parts. The Castle is made out of 4 parts : the main gate, 2 side walls and the rear main building.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The main gate has as main color medium&nbsp;dark flesh&nbsp;with some tan and white accents with 2 solid darkbrown doors. Left and right of the doors 2 panels are used and&nbsp;wonderful small&nbsp;arches for the ME look. White pillars with plants on both sides too and above the doors 2 fire buckets and 2 small catapults on the side towers. Finishing touch are the small white slopes that return in all Castle parts. The sides of the walls are finished on both sides with hinges&nbsp;on which the start of&nbsp;the side walls.</li>
	<li>The left side wall with below white bricks and above tan bricks mixed with the flesh bricks with holes which give a great color accent. This wall has a secret escape in it, on top small white slopes again, green leaves and 2 great golden banners.</li>
	<li>Right hand wall is the same as the left side but in stead of the escape a well invented trap with stairs you can pull in and out.</li>
	<li>The rear or main building is by far the best part of the Alamut Castle with white and gold as main colors. The 2 great stairs that take you to the first floor with the hidden dagger. The great looking centre fences and small white pillars. First floor with on the sides white walls with accents of gold and again white fences in the middle. The great looking big white pillars connected to the roof with the shining golden rooftops which return on 4 side pillars.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 4 modular parts are connected with pins&nbsp;and give the opportunity to give the Castle more than one shape as shown on the alternate pictures. All finished with nice details as the Silver teeth, golden cones, green leafs and the small white slopes.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks : </strong>too much parts to name here but the minifigures are absolutely wonderful just like the Camel. Some other great parts are all gold parts, the big white pillars, the 1x4 flesh&nbsp; bricks with studs and the small arches.</p>

<p><strong>Playablity 5 bricks :</strong> A great looking Castle with traps, 7 minifigures with Camel and attack firethrower must give hours of fun, no doubt.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks :</strong> new price in the Netherlands starts at this moment with &euro;60,00 which is a good price for a set like this. I bought it used for less than &euro;40,00 so if I could I would give a bonus brick to make it 6.</p>

"Fauch","2015-01-25T19:16:19.303Z","Completed model is better than the sum of its parts","<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>Overall I wasn&#39;t too impressed by the selection of parts, lots of basic bricks mostly.</p>

<p>The parts which stand out the most are easily the golden domes and the camel, which is actually bigger than a lego horse. Most of the other parts were unimpressive, except maybe for a gold scorpion, and some big doors, but the draws mostly comes from the colors and the abundances of some parts. This set has a lot of tan and some kind of earth orange color. This is currently my only set with orange parts, also, orange turrets are unique to this set. There is also a large number of fences (more than 10), of 4x1 with studs on side (more than 20) and of archs (I think 20-30). Also, it comes with 2 daggers of time. The dagger is quite a strange piece, the handle is hard plastic, but the blade is soft. It is quite a big weapon, being almost as long as a sword.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures here are good, but none is outstanding, they come with backprinting, I think only Dastan and Nizam have prints on legs, but most of the good comes from their accessories, guards come with nice helmets which I think are rare too, the assassin has a rare hoodie (or whatever it&#39;s called) made of hard plastic, and comes with a razor glove (which seems far more rare than the claws glove) but there is also an extra claws glove if he wants to dual wield those. The scimitar is also another rare great piece, it even has 3 studs if you want to customize it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s really an easy and straightforward build, there was really no advanced technic used. one thing to note is that the dome part is fragile and easily pops off. If you grab the model by the dome, it is very likely to come off.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I first thought the golden dome would make this model, but after finishing the palace part, I thought it looked quite small, and while it has a nice amount of details, I also have models which are much more detailled. However, it is a different story once you connect it to the rest of the model, it gives it much more depth and reveals the model in its full glory.</p>

<p>I still think it&#39;s a bit small, the pictures actually makes it look bigger than it is.&nbsp;The only similar model I have is fort legoredo, and it&#39;s like twice as big, but the different portions of the model go together very well to form a very nice looking fortified palace.</p>

<p>This build is modular, but it seems to only give you the option to open it up, with king&#39;s castle, it looks like you can switch some parts, and still have a closed castle, but it doesn&#39;t look possible here.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite being a bit small, it&#39;s still a nice model, the fact that it is a closed castle with several ways to assault it, such as going through the doors, breaking a wall, climbing movable stairs or even walls, gives good options for playability. And there is actually a good incentive for attacking this castle, the palace must be full of good loot. Or maybe it is run by a tyran?</p>

<p>Overall, my note for this would be more like 4.5, there is really not much wrong with it, but I have some models I consider more impressive.</p>

<p>Pros: The Alamut guards, Seso, Gool, Tamah, Nizam, all the features in the set, the exclusive camel that was only in 1 other set in a darker tan color, the large doors in dark brown and the castle towers in medium nougat are 100% exclusive just to this set, lots of nice ancient style weapons, especially the blade claw that tamah holds.</p>
