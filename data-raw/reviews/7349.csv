<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smaller vehicles you can build using this set are more or less good designed (rear part of the ""bubble-top-policecar"" looks quite empty, the small airplane is a bit too wide at front - but the rest is fine!). The four ""bigger"" models are an eyecatcher: the bank-safe looks very well, occassionally the door comes off when you try to open it. The police car looks almost better than the ones in the City-police-sets. The black sports car is far better than anything designed among cars in the last few years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best part is the small chopper - I could very well imagine it in a stand-alone set. It is perfectly designed, achieves to present a cool model by using a relatively small amount of bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A ""must-have"" if you are looking for a present for a kid - but also if you are an AFOL, there are quite a number of special bricks to get in this one.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"tkettle9719","2012-12-25T12:28:23.45Z","The Chase Begins...","<p>I got this set a few days ago as a gift for my younger cousin on Christmas. However, after learning that he had sets that he hadn't gotten around to building yet, my family decided&nbsp; to get him something else. However, so as not to enter the evil lines of Customer Service a few days after Christmas, I decided to take it. Even though I never really wanted this, I still think that it's a very nice set for anyone to have. <br></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The Getaway Car, which has 55 pieces with the minifigure included, is sleek and very correctly colored. It's not complex, but it looks awesome. <br></li><li>The Police helicopter, 47 pieces, manages to make a nice little search vehicle, and the pieces are perfect together. <br></li><li>The main vehicles shown on the cover have a ton of playability together, and both have the nice swoosh factor (the car can have swoosh-iness too). <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The exclusion of doors on the Getaway Car is a bit of a letdown since there are doors on the Police Car. <br></li><li>The helicopter is small and cramped; it's nice for kids, but adults will not be pleased by the miniature helicopter/ <br></li><li>There are pieces which appear in one model, and it sort of dissappoints me that these couldn't be integrated into the other set of models. <br></li></ul>
<p>The Brickmaster City book is a nice gift which allows people to go do what they want with a set amount of pieces. Complete with inspiration models and full instructions for two sets of two models each, this is a nice gift for children. I would recommend this if it were on sale. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
