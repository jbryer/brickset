<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are four models that can be built:</p>
<p>Battle on Christophsis<br/>This set of models uses up all the bricks, you get a AAT Battle Tank and a NU-Class Attack Shuttle. The battle tank is simple but nicely scaled, the shuttle has good playability and looks quite cool, but it is not designed well for stand display though. This set is also not minifig scaled.</p>
<p>Ice Encounter<br/>This is a very simple set, not much sophistication on the STAS (Single Trooper Airspeeders) and the LAAT (Low altitude Assault Transport). </p>
<p>Desert Raid<br/>The Mobile Missile Platform in this set is very interesting and innovative in my opinion, the mountable blaster cannon is very cool. The S-Wing Speeder bike is also excellent!</p>
<p>Forest Fight<br/>This is actually my favorite among 4, the VTS (Varied Terrain Speeder) looks like a firepowerhouse with good agility, while the AT-RT walker is definitely a formidable foe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although not all models are as great as you may want it to be, it is already very impressive to be able to build these 4 models using the same set of bricks, I think we need to appreciate the brains behind the design of this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book also has nice content and some cool trivias to entertain the readers.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-06T22:11:53.257Z","Continue this Clone War Does","<p>Brickmaster Star Wars: I can honestly say that I was pleasantly surprised with the look and design of this book compared with last years Castle and Pirates ones. Unlike the other three Brickmaster Books offered so far this one comes with an impressive 240 bricks, that's 100 more than last years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With it you get to build four scenes, not as many as the last years books, since you only build 8 models, but what you're building makes up for the lower number of models offered with this book alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first scene is the Battle on Christophsis: It features two Mini Vehicle scaled models, and they are quite large compared to other mini vehicles in the Star Wars line. They are not scaled for Mini-Figure use, but LEGO can be forgiven for this. The Battle Droid stands next to a mini scaled Trade Federation AAT. The Clone stands next to a Republic Nu-class Attack Shuttle. The vehicles look suitably impressive despite not being Mini-Figure scaled and are built up quite nicely. Using some familiar and not-so-familiar pieces in the mix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second scene offers up the first two Mini-Figure scaled vehicles. This scene is called Ice Encounter and supposedly takes place on one of the ice worlds in the Star Wars universe. The Battle Droid is piloting a Separatist Speeder, while the Clone pilots a Small Gunship. Both of them are quite nice and look very fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third scene I haven't built up yet, I'm still on the second one for my display, but eventually I'll get to building it. It is called Desert Raid. The Clone is sent to investigate a desert planet on a Republic Speeder Bike (pretty bulky for a speeder bike.) and the Battle Droid is manning a Mobile Missile Platform. Since I haven't built this one yet I can't really comment on it, but the instructions look quite detailed so I'm sure these models will both be fun and exciting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fourth and final scene is called Forest Fight, the Battle Droid is now piloting the VTS (Varied Terrain Speeder) while the Clone has a small AT-RT, again I haven't built these guys yet, but the instructions look fun and will be quite nice as display pieces. I think they'll be some of the funnest models out of the whole set next to the Mini Vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am extremely impressed with the new look for both of the Brickmaster Books released so far (still haven't picked up Atlantis yet though) they offer up a lot of fun facts and trivia to read and the stories are expanded upon for each scene compared to the last years books. The LEGO Brickmaster Star Wars book also stands out next to the others from the outside as well. LEGO seems to be stepping up their Brickmaster Books this year and I'm curious to know how next years (if any are made) will look. I still think it's better to get both of them on sale as compared to paying full price, especially since this years books prices have gone up by a few dollars each.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-20T05:25:23.423Z","LEGO Gear (Books/Dorling Kindersley) - BrickMaster Star Wars Review","This is not a book which we usually see in stores. In fact: It's a book which has a boatload of instructions and tips. We have 4 different scenes which all have two vehicles. There's one vehicle for the bad guys and one for the good guys. In total we get 8 different models in one set. The scene we can see on the cover of this book has a mini aat and a mini republic attack shuttle. Both vehicles are very nice. The aat has a dark blue color and some sviwel turrets on the sides and a cannon which sviwels on the top. The shuttle has movable fins and a movable cockpit.<br><br>The second scene we get includes a cargo speeder for the bad guys and another clone walker. For some reason I like this walker more than the walker from the battle pack version. The third scene has a speeder bike for the good guys and another cargo speeder for the bad guys. The speeder bike isn't a very good one but I like the design of it. The only problem is that the cannon on the front falls off sometimes. The last version you can build has a tank for the republic army and a speeder for the seperatists army.<br><br>If I had to choose my favourite model I would choose the one with the walker. We also get another minifig of a clone trooper and a battle droid which you can add to your LEGO Star Wars collection. It's a good set and we also don't get any stickery which you need to put on.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Huge_Nerd","2011-02-24T15:49:33.993Z","Fan-brickin'-tastic!","<p>I got this book during a Borders going out of business sale and I am very, very impressed with it. It's my first Brickmaster book. </p>
<p>The first set of models are mini-vehicles. Both are very nicely detailed models of Star Wars canon vehicles. They go nicely with other mini-vehicles I have.</p>
<p>The three mini-figure scale battles are also very, very nice. While not really canon Star Wars vehicles, they look like they could be. The tech specs and storylines provided in the book are very nice touch that makes the vehicles seem&nbsp;more like&nbsp;actual canon&nbsp;Star Wars equipment. All the sets are a nice size too and the color schemes of each model contrast nicely. I think my favorite is the forest battle. I also really appreciated each build. All four are long and satisfying. </p>
<p>The book itself is a lot of fun. The little story lines captions and especially speech bubbles are an added touch of fun as you build. Anyway, this set is definitely one to get!</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"DawnTreader","2013-08-06T02:41:49.177Z","A lot of parts and great models","<p>Having only built 1 of the 8 models I can say that this set is great. My 5 year old son and I spent a chunk of our afternoon catching up on all his new LEGO and this was a great package.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>a lot of parts, didn't think 240 was that many</li><li>brickmaster type models</li><li>well laid out instructions with very distinct color visibility</li><li>8 possible models shown, 4 for each of the 2""sides""</li><li>6 of the models allow use of the figures as pilots</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>packaging is overly large </li><li>there isn't really a story, just a bunch of information about star wars vehicles</li><li>a trade federation droid is not a minifigure</li><li>2 models are ""mini"" designs that don't allow minifigure use to pilot</li></ul><p>I think that this is a great set and the concept is sound, but the book is rather large and I am not sure how to store it with the rest of the LEGO collection. I think my biggest beef is that I thought there was a story to it as well, but the characters randomly interact based on the models and where they are used. there is no plot or driving force behind their interactions.</p><p>The information in the book could be used as part of a star wars encyclopedia.</p><p>If I had seen this set at a store when it first came out and saw a price of $32 CAD I would have put it back on the shelf. But I found this at a discount store for $20 CAD and decided that it would be a pretty good buy at that price, I was right. Even on auction/used sites this set is still going at a price of $25 to $30 dollars which is more than it ever should be bought for.</p><p>If you see this for $20 or less, buy it, that price point makes it a good deal.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,5
"JediAnakin","2011-08-03T03:37:06.767Z","Superb!","<p>The Star Wars Brickmaster. What a wonderful set. More bricks than the others makes this one a lot better for value!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Instructions are good and normal, whereas the cover is fantastic. 5/5</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>240&nbsp;Pieces, Around a 100 more than the others! 5/5</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Clone Trooper and Battle Droid. As a new star wars buyer, this served me well. 5/5</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>4 different builds, 8 different models. I went for the Forest one. I got an AT-RT, which was easy to build, however the droid ship was a bit annoying! 5/5</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Very nice, brilliant for boosting the Republic and&nbsp;Confederacy&nbsp;of&nbsp;Independent&nbsp;Systems armies. 5/5</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A set well worth getting!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
