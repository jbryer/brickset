This set intrigued me since the day I saw it, but hard if not impossible to get it in original state. So I bought some parts I did not have and&nbsp;took the other more basic bricks out of my spare parts. I still miss several parts like some small windows and some blue slopes but that will come in the future. Not a playable set without minifigures, just a must have Castle for me. The historic value allowed me to reward it with 5 bricks. Not a review to convince people to get this set but simply because the first Castle deserved a review !!</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks </strong>: Not a very difficult set to built of course surely if you compare it with the modern castle&#39;s. It asks some good looking and counting for the base but once you get started it is all very simple but this is normal considering the basic parts used and the year it was brought out : 1970. The instructions (for me a copy) are good to read and easy to follow.I love the colors they used for this cute Castle : red, white, yellow, blue and some gray.</p>

<p><strong>Parts&nbsp;4 bricks</strong> : No real special parts, all the bricks used are basic. The only special part is the Lego flag on the highest tower, I was very lucky to find one in real good condition. So 3 bricks for the regular parts and 1 bonus for the flag.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 2 bricks</strong> : Kids will always see a way to play with a Castle but since the set has no Knights, I think&nbsp;2 bricks are sufficient.</p>

<p><strong>Value 3 bricks</strong> : Keep it in the middle, one for sale on Bricklink for some &euro; 160,00.&nbsp;Whether&nbsp;this set&nbsp;is really&nbsp;worth it,&nbsp;is up to the one who wants it. An original will keep its value and definitely will rise in value in the future. Really no idea how much mine has cost considering I spent some &euro; 25,00 for parts. For me it was just the fun to be able to built this historical set.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>This is proper old-school Lego. Released in 1970, it&#39;s full of standard bricks and plates. There are only 19 steps in the instructions - but in the first 6 or 7 steps you&#39;re adding 40-odd pieces at each step. Which is surprisingly challenging - and easy to miss out the odd piece as you are going round. The instructions are only in colour for the parts you are adding at each step - but the white ones always only ever white, same as the already-placed pieces! Considering how limited the piece variety was in 1970, it&#39;s well put together - some clever use of 2x3 plates to form the turrets etc</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>471 pieces - comfortably the largest set released in 1970. Only 5 colours in the whole set - 6 if you include the solitary black part. Pretty much all standard bricks and plates from the very limited parts portfolio in the late 60&#39;s. And lots of them - &nbsp;48-off 2x4 bricks, 125-off 1x2 bricks, 60-off 1x4 bricks, 39-off 1x6 bricks. There&#39;s a few 1x1x2 windows and 2x2 double convex 45 slopes that aren&#39;t really used nowadays.&nbsp; It has a very similar number of different part types to a 2020 polybag from 3xxxx series - that shows how far Lego have come in the last 50 years! When building it I found myself asking &quot;why didn&#39;t you use a &quot;x&quot; piece?&quot; Then realised they didn&#39;t exist in 1970. So, if you want a model that&#39;s good for stocking up on (or using up) standard bricks in standard colours - this is it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Only part that&#39;s of note is the old &quot;wavy&quot; Lego flag. These are very rare parts nowadays, and extremely fragile - the flagpole is just too thin to last very long in the hands of an &quot;enthusiastic&quot; primary school child!</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Not a lot you can do with this, apart from build it. Then destroy it to make other stuff - but it&#39;s really good as a parts donor set. This set was released 4 years before the old armless and faceless minifigs, so it&#39;s not as if you can fill your castle with &quot;soldiers&quot; complete with standard Lego flat cap!</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve rated this as a 5 - but I&#39;ve no idea how much this cost new. Or how many boxes of Weetabix you had to eat to get hold of it. It&#39;s so old that the price would have been in old money shillings and pence - Britain didn&#39;t go decimal until the middle of 1971.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I enjoyed building this. It&#39;s a pretty good model, considering the very limited parts portfolio available at the time it was designed - hats off to the designer who did it. It&#39;s a brilliant parts donor set for when you want to build something else - you could probably build a whole street of 1970&#39;s Lego houses with the parts this set contains.</p>
