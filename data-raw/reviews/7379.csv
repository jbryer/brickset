"T79","2014-06-10T11:16:54.967Z","#383's little brother","<p>Another one of those old lego sets I never even knew I had, this one can be seen as a smaller variety of #383 (even though this one&nbsp;came first, the #383 remains as my de facto standard of these LEGOLAND vehicles).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Again, I never had these and have never seen them except as online scans.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with all these vehicles I have reviewed up to now; lots of wheels and hinges again. Furthermore a nice variety of standard bricks and plates and some doors and caterpillar tracks. The plates with hole, car base and wheel brick with steering axle holder are always special but have limited use outside of these vehicles (I don&#39;t remember using them a lot myself when I was a kid).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The dozer/digger is slightly more complex than most of the other vehicles in this category, but that still isn&#39;t saying much. The dozer blade and digger&nbsp;bucket are&nbsp;constructed upside down though, and the bucket is connected with what seems an endless supply of hinges. All in all, a more challenging build&nbsp;than either #382 or #383.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&#39;Square&#39; is the word that comes to mind, there&#39;s not a sloped brick in the set besides two parts to secure the tractor on the trailer. As with its brethren, instantly recognizable in its simplicity so they can be seen as stylized depictions of reality.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This one has been used alongside #383 as it fits thematically. One brother controls the digger and the other one goes on dozing everything that needs to be moved out of the way (which, in practice, means <em>everything </em>of course). The only minor gripe here is that the construction is a little less sturdy, both dozer blade and digger bucket tend to come off if handled a bit rough which didn&#39;t happen so much with #383.</p>

<p>As I am writing this the cheapest one on BrickLink is sold for almost &euro;40 (also without box and instructions) which is obviously only something for the collector. I&#39;d see it as a smaller and&nbsp;cheaper alternative to #383 but this isn&#39;t the case, so if you <em>really</em> need one I&#39;d still point to #383.</p>
