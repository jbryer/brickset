Pluses include a printed slope part, 2 sets of wheels, purple bricks and 2 green plates. Like the rest of the sets in this Happy Meal promotion, the set is kind of plain but it works with this set. I wish I had more of them so I could build up my purple slope collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

That being said, four of the pieces are purple slopes. Purple was a very uncommon colour back in the day! Grimace&#39;s face was printed on an oddly smooth 33&deg; 3x2 slope piece. I&#39;m assuming they went smooth to get a cleaner print, but it&#39;s a pretty rare mould. Based on Bricklink, only a few non-McDonalds sets used this smooth slope.</p>

<p>I last built this set as a child when it was first released, but the rarity of the colour purple made this a cherished favourite of mine, as someone who loved rare colours and parts.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t ask much more out of a happy meal toy. The build is a little ugly, but it was still a great part donor.</p>
