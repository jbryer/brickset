I have always thought of it as a bit of an 'oddity' as it is a completely different 'scale' to most of the other vehicles Lego were putting out at the time. <br>&nbsp;<br>It has a steering mechanism which turns the front wheels from the steering wheel. this is basically a couple of components with groooves cut into them, and does not seem to work all that well, but then we are talking about 36 year-old bits of plastic!<br>&nbsp;<br>It does come in a very nice period box.",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3
