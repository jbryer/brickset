When I acquired these sets from a garage sale I didn't have many green parts and most of what I had came from these sets. For the limited selection of pieces included in this set the model looks OK but I don't care for the tail of the plane. I really hope that LEGO and McDonald's partner up again soon to release LEGO (NOT Bionicle) sets in Happy Meals.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
