Box has a different picture and a short text in Italian referring to a very nice poster inside. It contains 120 pieces. I paid it € 5 for a monumental pleasure to memory: I was 14 in 1978 and playing with Lego for 10 years already... <br>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5

Surprising they did not name the set as such.<div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Maxifigures:</b></div><div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4></div><div><ul><li>Moustache prints.</li><li>Hair shapes.</li><li>Top hats.</li></ul><b>Matrimony</b></div><div>Well the bride likes her man bushy as he is sporting a top lip caterpillar of the handle bar variety. The best man is equally ready for application to work as a circus ring master and carries a small tome for the ceremony. Are those white stockings? Lets hope not but it is 1978. The bride is possibly the best build with all those extra bricks for skirt and she's appropriately holding a bunch of flowers.</div><div><br></div><div>The hair pieces are actually really good with a variety of styles. Its funny how I used to see loads of freckles on children in my childhood and not so much now? Either way these prints add much character and the page boy and girl are likeable figures. The spectacled gent in blue may be the vicar with the brightly coloured women bridesmaids.</div><div><br></div><div>Even with these larger figures I prefer full brick built objects where people are concerned so the characters are complemented and have interaction available. This is otherwise a funny old set from an era of constructed doll-like people who required rather large builds. Perhaps this contributed to their demise and they make excellent giants in a minifigure based world where diminished proportions allowed economical and quicker building.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Wedding Reception</b></div><div>It matters not as their place in the Lego timeline is an important evolutionary step and where such fun bits and pieces exist, especially those top hats, children will invariably create and play happily. Does what it says on the tin, a 1970's bit of nostalgia for young kids of any era.</div><h4><p></p></h4>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
