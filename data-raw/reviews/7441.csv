<br />
It has quite a few (small scale) buildings for a set of its period (1975) and a couple of vehicles too. The early pre-minifig people have no faces, they had not yet evolved into the minifigs we know today. <br />
<br />
A bonus with this set is the white pigtail hair (only available in three sets) a big selling factor for myself.<br />
<br />
I guess the playability of the set was quite good when it was released, with even parents getting in on the action with their children (or so the cover art suggests). I like the early cardboard baseplate too.<br />
<br />
Overall a nice collectors set, look for one with stickers (not a big fan) intact and remember it is 35 years old or more.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,3
