(it was with set 4 all mixed up). when it arrived with box and no instructions&nbsp;<div>i started to look online for part listing and instructions. there was two versions of parts listed one on Peeron and the other on Brick link with one having parts the other did not have like wheels etc, this i thought odd as it doesn't advertise wheels on the cover but in set 4 of the same Basic series it does. so my understanding would be if it had the wheels they would be on the cover.</div><div>but for a collector this is a basic and great set.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4
