The vast majority of the bricks are still going strong, sorted by colour in a set of drawers at my parents&#39; house on the insistence of my niece, so she can find the bricks and parts she needs quickly.</p>

<p>Over the years, one of the blue flat plates broke in two, but remained usable so long as the pieces were joined together. The green base plate became a little fragile over the years, the result of bending it back to release bricks which were stuck a little too firmly.</p>

<p>A few part designs were superseded over the years, and it&#39;s easy to see why. The door I always found awkward, being three dots broad I disliked how it made a structure asymmetric. I also found the small shutters limiting, and the lack of grip on the tyres troubled me too as a youngster.</p>

<p>Overall however, this proved to be a great introduction to Lego, and over forty years later its durability proves the range&#39;s strength - knowing we could always rely on a substantial stock of bricks to add to our latest designs is surely what Lego is all about.</p>
