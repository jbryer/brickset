<p>Pre-minifigure, these characters did not move in the legs (though you could build legs onto them) but the hair was removeable, the heads turned and the arm joints were quite intricate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scooter itself is fairly easy to build, but I shall give it a 5 since it was perfect for me at 4 or 5 (if not perhaps 3?) and had a unique piece for the handlebar/headlight.&nbsp; The potential downside was the loss of the smaller pieces: The arm-joints or the hand pieces which could be removed from the sockets.</p>
<p>I think if Lego ever re-issued retro sets or you find one of these its worth displaying.&nbsp; It's very vintage, pretty rustic in form and seems very European to me.&nbsp; Add a piece of string and its a cute ornament for a Christmas tree.&nbsp; Definitely a piece for a true Lego enthusiast.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
