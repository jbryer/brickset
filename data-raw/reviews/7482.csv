Not shown were the two red weights under the water that kept the ship upright, not that I found they were ever needed because it was stable enough in water. However because of this you could attach anything to the bottom, like wheels and make a cool land ship.</p>

<p>The downside, as always, is the stickers. My dad carefully sliced through the stickers with a razor blade when the model was complete so that I could take it apart.&nbsp; A must if you wanted to take out the middle parts of the ship and make a shorter tugboat type ship.</p>

<p>Being pre-minifig era means minifigs aren&#39;t really to scale, but don&#39;t let that stop you.</p>

<p>A pretty good model for its time.</p>

I ordered it and was amazed by the older building techniques. I am a fan of old sets and own two others and love to see older techniques. this set is either one of or the first to use an illegal building technique which i think is really cool. I like that it includes the red boat pieces underneath and i think it makes it just a little more interesting. this set is amazing for playability and for displayability which is what my dad would use it for.</p>
