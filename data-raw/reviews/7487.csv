"Ernst","2011-07-13T17:30:50.8Z","Cowboys - One of my first sets, the earliest minifigures","<p>Overall a&nbsp;nice set, if you may call it a set. It was one of my first Lego sets I got when I was young and I found it back on the loft last year, still complete with box and instructions. This set and some other small old sets I found back brought back my interest and fun in Lego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building this you can hardly call an experience so 2 bricks here, the horse is in fact the most ""difficult"" part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts I give 4 bricks, simply because I realise now years later that this set is one of the first ones&nbsp;in which Lego&nbsp;attempts to use minifigures. No real legs yet,&nbsp;but a torso and a head with both a cowboy hat, the start of many more figures to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two bricks for playability, the biggest thing to play is trying to let the figures trade places or stand instead of sitting on the fence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value is priceless for me, having it still in the condition in which I got it then. Bricklink values this set for an average of €10,50. I would not sell this for €100,00 but that is for emotional reasons. Normally I think the €10,00 is a fair price for such an old set if it is complete still.</p>

<p>There are not many parts and no minifigs at all!&nbsp; Instead everything is brick-built.&nbsp; Back then Lego was presented at least partially as an &#39;art&#39; toy, more used for &#39;painting&#39; with coloured bricks than building.&nbsp; Nonetheless, this kit actually does a good job of representing its subject, albeit in an abstract way.&nbsp; The attention to detail is also surprizingly high - the horse&#39;s ears and the Cowboys&#39; scarves for instance.&nbsp; The bricks for the Cowboys&#39; bodies are also fascinating, a kind of forerunner to real minifigs with clear hints where LEGO were going.&nbsp; There are no seperate arms, but the shape is very close to modern figures and the head also, albeit expressionless and slightly rounder.&nbsp; There is a great deal of lego &#39;archaeology&#39; on display here!</p>

<p>It is a simple enough kit to build, although I am fairly sure I was given help by my parents, being very young.&nbsp; I do clearly remember putting the fence together and getting it wrong - stacking the two yellow 1x8 plates together and thinking one was missing when it came time to add the second rail!&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the day this kit transcends any usual values for a lego review.&nbsp; It is peerless and priceless for me.&nbsp; Even my parents always remembered it.&nbsp; Very, very fond memories for such a small set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The cowboys can swap roles, although it looks awkward.&nbsp; When our bow-legged friend stands on the fence, it does appear he is using it as a wild west latrine.&nbsp; Our black-hatted friend can ride the horse, but only side-saddle.&nbsp; While this does appear a bit feminine for a rugged cowboy, the Lego wild west is an inclusive environment that encourages cowboys to ride side-saddle if they wish to.&nbsp; The boys can swap roles in a more natural looking way, but this requires them to take off their pants and swap them.&nbsp; This does have a bit of a Brokeback Mountain feel about it but, again, the Lego wild west is very inclusive.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Both faces are entirely featureless.&nbsp; Our cowboys no doubt experience the full range of complex emotions but reveal nothing of this to the outside world, much like Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain.&nbsp; The Lego torsos of 1976 allow Lego to conform to its strict pacifist company policy; the cowboys are unarmed.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Both cowboys have red 1x2 plates between their heads and torsos.&nbsp; I assume the designer was hoping these would look like scarves.&nbsp; To me, it appears as though the sheriff tried to hang both men, but the rope broke each time, leaving each man with a blood-soaked noose around his neck.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The horse is a brilliant.&nbsp; The illegal use of a 1x2 tile for ears caps off a complex build with clever parts use.&nbsp; A professional Lego set designer designed this set, and executives at the company judged it to be one of the 28 best designs of 1976.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Lego produced only one other wild west themed Legoland set in 1976.&nbsp; So, when 617 Cowboys was combined with other Legoland sets of the era it was both anachronistic and slightly out of scale, further decreasing the already very limited play value of the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">What should we make of this set?&nbsp; It was boring to build, offered almost no play value, and was embarrassing to display.&nbsp; The goal of any Lego set is to give children pleasure when they own the set and adults ongoing pleasure as they recall the set.&nbsp; On this measure, the set is a complete success.&nbsp; Every so often I rediscover this set, and it makes me smile more than almost any other.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I would not recommend buying the set, mainly because the set was produced 47 years ago and most toy stores no longer stock it.&nbsp; I do however recommend building the set from parts you own and displaying it prominently in your home.</p>
