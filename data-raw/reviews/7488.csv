Lego released this set in 1976 and for some reason decided to make it yellow with black wings. While those colours made for a nice looking set the original plane was silver-grey.<br>It's not easy to review a 34 year old set. You really can't compare it to todays sets. The parts selection was pretty good for its day; there's a propellor, a tail fin and those brand new inverted slope pieces. Building can't have been a challenge, even if I was only 6 at the time.<br>Once finished it was definitely swooshable, but it didn't really fit in with anything else. It was too small for the minifigs yet it was too big to share an airport with the Caravelle or the Boeing.<br>Value for money is impossible to rate. There are a few on Bricklink, ranging from about €15 for used without box to €170 for mint condition in box. Obviously the 50 parts inside the box aren't worth anywhere near that price but that's where emotional value and collectors prices come in.<br>So here we have an odd-size classic plane in the wrong colour and still....<br>there's something very likable about this set, just because it's different. It's definitely one of my childhood favourites.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,3
