Great model without stickers, easy to built and a great result with the basic bricks available in these years. A great addition for the vintage Lego collector and affordable.</p><p>Building&nbsp;3 bricks : not the hardest built but fun to do with as result a very solid vehicle.</p><p>Parts&nbsp;3 bricks : not the most spectacular parts of course but chosen very well. If you have a lot of &nbsp;""old"" bricks it is possible to make it yourself. The few special parts are the canopy and the side exhaust pipes.</p><p>Playability 3 bricks : when assembled not much playing possibilities aside from letting it race through your room.</p><p>Value 5 bricks : I found it in a lot I bought so almost for free. The average price on <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=695-1"">Bricklink</a> is some â‚¬17,00 which is a good price if complete with instructions so in reach for every vintage Lego fan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,3,5

<p>However, unlike many other kits of the late 1970s, it doesn&#39;t hold up well against its counterparts from the late 2010s.&nbsp; For example, the lines and colors of the Galaxy Explorer have never been repeated just so, and there hasn&#39;t been a decent Moonbase for years.&nbsp; The Yellow Castle still stands out compared to modern castles for its unusual color and its hinged walls.&nbsp; Although Capital City has just as many features as Main Street, the lack of road plates means it doesn&#39;t feel quite the same.&nbsp; Unique features like those are what continue to make many older sets desirable even though they may lack the sophisticated builds and details of modern sets.&nbsp; In contrast, the specific feature set of this kit (a minifig-scaled&nbsp;Formula One car with four spinning wheels) has been replicated many times over the years, with increasing sophistication.&nbsp; Compared to the recent Speed Champions and Creator F1 cars, the 1976 model is just ugly and boring.</p>

<p>TL;DR - A worthy effort for 1976, but an easy pass in 2018.&nbsp; Don&#39;t hunt this one down on eBay unless you&#39;re a serious collector of Lego history.</p>
