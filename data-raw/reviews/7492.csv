I have to admit, i thought there would a few pieces missing etc. But no, its very nice and original,Boxed, instructions, lego range pamphlett and even 2 gold brick stickers(some sort of lego rewards scheme from the 70's?).

The model is a nice example of lego from this time, its all very simple to be honest, but in a good way. the minifigure is a bit scary(armbuds? no face? etc, at least he has a hat). there are no rare pieces, although the old style wheels are a nice touch. Its a suitably chunky and tough model when altogether(the horses legs are the only real weak points)

its a nice old set, and whilst i would'nt go out my way to collect lego from this era its a nice piece(especially in such excellent condition) to have and welcome to trot through my lego town anyday.

To appreciate a set like this you have to see it in the context of when it was released. In 1976 minifigs did not yet have arms or faces. Wheels were red and came attached to a 2x2 or 2x4 brick. Two exciting new parts had just been introduced: the 2x2 inverted slope and the 1x4x1 fence!<div><br></div><div>So while this stage coach looks very primitive by todays standards, when it was released it was very impressive indeed. The minifig is obviously a cowboy with a hat like that, and by placing his legs in front of him you make him sit down. The new yellow fence is put to good use on the roof to hold the 1x2 brick that is of course a suitcase. Who cares that the doors don't open and there's no passenger inside? Look at those impressive black horses that use the new inverted slope pieces to shape their legs!</div><div><br></div><div>Building doesn't take long and isn't difficult but is fun all the same. The front wheels are cleverly attached to the coach with a ball and socket coupling and SNOT is used for the horses ears. At 95 pieces this was no small set at a time when the smaller Model Team sets had 140 pieces and a little car set could have as few as 20 pieces.</div><div><br></div><div>A set that introduced two new parts, used a clever building technique and looked great. What more could a six year old ask for?</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,4
