<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Never had them, I probably received this one built as I remember I had it but I can not remember building it before.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Everything you need to build a tractor with front loader: the bucket has been used in lots of them, as were the big tyres. The&nbsp;road signs were always nice to have, they are actually&nbsp;in minifig scale but that just made them better!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Blue maxifigs with nice hats, one with a hammer and one driving the (by maxifig standards) tiny tractor. One weird thing I noticed&nbsp;between the maxifig sets I had is that there was no real standard: in one set the figures could be a brick taller than in another set, in this case leading to positively small workmen.&nbsp;Same with the arms, here the workmen have just one arm piece (so no elbows) while in other sets the figures have two.&nbsp;When seen with&nbsp;another set like #254 Family (with that massive baby carriage!) this makes it look like these workmen are actually children playing but I doubt that was the intention.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Again an easy build, still slightly more involved than #214 Red Indians. And the parts were useful for making your own big (minifig) tractors.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Par for the course, simple but recognizable. This was one of the more playable &#39;building set with people&#39; I had, and that&#39;s why it was my favourite.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>History seems to repeat itself, as my children gravitate to this one in favour of the others like #200 and #254, just like I did.&nbsp;Though the theme itself must be more appealing&nbsp;to them as well, judging on how much they love #383 Truck with Excavator or #10657 My First Lego Set with its construction theme.</p>
