<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I never had the box, and the instructions have been long lost. I can&#39;t even remember I had them so maybe it came built when it was handed down?</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some very unique parts here: the&nbsp;red maxifig head and hands, the headdress with feather (which, amazingly, survived the ravages of time and eager children) and the black mirror as paddle (which, sadly, did not). Even a red minifig head (without print) and a black pigtail hairdo!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Maxifigures, really, unless you count the papoose as half a minifig. Standard fare constructed maxifigs with the unique twist that these are red instead of standard yellow. Early lego racial profiling? The way the minifig is used to represent a baby is very clever, even though the slightest touch makes mama&nbsp;tip over&nbsp;backwards.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy as can be, really. Most of this is also the maxifigures, the canoe&nbsp;contains but a small fraction of the bricks included in this set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A pair of Indians in a canoe with another pair on the shore. Like all lego of that time it is (exceedingly) simple but recognizable. There&#39;s not much to play with here though, you can move the canoe and have the others wave as it passes by.&nbsp;It could be more fun alongside&nbsp;#210 Cowboys, but I never had that one nor was I ever aware it existed until recently.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If it weren&#39;t for the unique angle this wouldn&#39;t have received four stars as overall rating, but since this is the only Indian&nbsp;set in the &#39;building set with people&#39; theme it receives extra points for being special. This must have been one of the last western themed sets (there were some with those early minifigs) until, well, &#39;western&#39; in 1996.</p>

"BrickbyBrickDFM","2020-08-05T05:22:19.23Z","Homemakers Set 215 - American Indian ","<p>I was excited when I purchased this set from eBay for a reasonable price. As a person of color and a&nbsp;LEGO&nbsp;collector I have been trying to collect sets that include diverse figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, at the same time I am also conscious of certain images that reinforce&nbsp;negative stereotypes regarding American Indians. &nbsp;The 1977 Homemakers LEGO set 215 could be viewed as controversial in today&#39;s climate. During the time of&nbsp;this review, America finds itself dealing with racial tensions,&nbsp;particularly with sport team&#39;s&nbsp;mascots and the impact of COVID-19 on American Indian reservations. This pressure has eventually caused Daniel Snyder,&nbsp;owner of the&nbsp;Washington Football Team to reevaluate&nbsp;the&nbsp;name, logo,&nbsp;and mascot&nbsp;of the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, as I&nbsp;write this review I will try not to be biased by historical and racial issues.&nbsp;The build itself was fun. For being a smaller set, the number of maxifugures&nbsp;exceeded my expectations. &nbsp;The set has a total of 93 pieces (4 maxifugures&nbsp;and one minifigure). The set can be built&nbsp;into a canoe or other items, like a camp fire, native totem, etc... Other than these couple of small builds,&nbsp;this set really doesn&#39;t have much playable features. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What excites me the most is having the original box. The box art is so elegant look of the past, which is so nostalgic of basic building experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;As an&nbsp;AFOL&nbsp;I see this as more of a collector&#39;s design piece to be displayed. &nbsp;</p>
