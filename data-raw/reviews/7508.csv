Better late then never, as the saying goes, so after some searching&nbsp;I dug up the instructions for this set from peeron. Maybe the parts we have are from&nbsp;a lot of other sets and not this one but that&#39;s the beauty of it: we happen to have parts that match this set so who knows what they were from? Or, who <em>cares</em>? Not my kids, at any rate!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I have never even seen these, unfortunately. I&#39;m not even sure this <em>is</em>&nbsp;a set we had :)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A lot of plates in this set, almost two thirds of the ~130 pieces are plates in all sizes between 1 x 1 and 4 x 8 in about all colours available at the time (even one in gray). Then some regular bricks and slopes,&nbsp;2 x 2 bricks with wheels and 1 x 4 plates with towball and socket. The best parts where those white 1 x 4 x 2 fences (our only white ones until #320 BASIC building set) and the yellow 1 x 4 arches (our only ones in yellow until #6276 Eldorardo Fortress, they then proved invaluable in extending that theme). There also was a grey round 1 x 1 brick with closed stud but it seems we have lost that part, there still are some of those in our collection in just about every colour <em>but</em> grey.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One of those &quot;old style&quot; minifigs without defined arms, legs or even a face. We had some more&nbsp;of these and frankly, they never saw much use. But he did come with our one and only cowboy hat and&nbsp;that alone made this worth it!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>While not aiming for realistic, detailed animals these&nbsp;are surprisingly adorable and recognizable in their simplicity and divided in two size categories.&nbsp;The giraffe is yellow and tall. The zebra is striped in white and black (hilariously, they are <em>horizontal</em> stripes but they work to sell it as a zebra) and the lion is again yellow but with black manes and lying down. They are all one stud wide, the &quot;big&quot; animals are two studs wide: a red hippopotamus and a blue elephant. The jeep is simple but the wheel bricks are used nicely here: they are placed under the 4 x 8 plate with the arches as wheel wells and one side of the wheel brick as radiator. The (I guess) camera is created by sticking a plate upright between two studs which would be quite illegal now; even as a kid I was aware of this potential building technique but it never looked &#39;right&#39; to me.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>All animals are recognizable (the lion and hippopotamus maybe a bit less, at least my wife had less trouble naming the others) and the size difference is acceptable although the elephant especially could be a bit bigger. It is even possible that&nbsp;the hippopotamus is really some sort of wildebeest or warthog in which case the scale of the elephant is even more off. They do make for a distinctly multicoloured group of animals though! Too bad the details on the jeep are stickers, they are long gone. The jeep comes with a trailer, why does he have a cage on there though? Is this really a shady expedition to catch&nbsp;wild animals? Or does he just use it to store his hat when he&#39;s driving the car?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Compared to later sets this really doesn&#39;t look like much, but still there is this kind of retro charm to it and small kids love the brightly coloured animals! They&#39;d actually like this as much without the jeep and probably more without the jeep and slightly more detailed animals. Playability isn&#39;t much but those animals do keep turning up in the least expected places! Too bad they&#39;re a bit fragile...</p>

This was one of the sets which was built and then not kept long-term. Technically, the vehicle is an interesting build, I recall learning from this set about building vehicles with trailers and how to build them so that the towing coupling is level. The vehicle has an interesting use of bricks too, the small arches over the wheels and the latticed panels were new to us back then. And this was the only old-style minifigure we had, so it didn&#39;t get a lot of play in the proper minifigure era, except for a few characters trying on the hat. Also I don&#39;t think we ever built the animals. So a good set for learning from (for us and for Lego as they developed their range) but not a long-term keeper for me.</p>
