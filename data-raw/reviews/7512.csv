First, its box is different from other town sets.&nbsp;Very nice green paint. And those backgrounds reminiscent of an old storybook. I love it!&nbsp;The second curiosity: minifigs!</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>In 1978, no minifigure with a printed torso was issued.&nbsp;A sticker was used instead.&nbsp;But one of the guys here already has a printed torso. Would this be the first printed torso minifigure?&nbsp;Another curiosity is the yellow safety helmet. Very rare, it was only in this single set for a long time. Unless only one exists in this set.</p>

<h3>Track</h3>

<p>Or anyone who was a kid at this time used to get the minifigures issued with the gray 12-volt rail tracks.&nbsp;Compared to that, it&rsquo;s pretty weird to see the old 4.5-volt blue track in this set. Not a very common sight.&nbsp;It&#39;s like a glitch in the matrix.</p>

<p>The flat wagon is the same as the other blue-track railroad cars of the 1970s.</p>

<h3>Car</h3>

<p>The yellow car is quite a disappointment. On the one hand, you can&#39;t put a minifigure in it, which spoils the gameplay.&nbsp;On the other hand, it was in 1978 that the car chassis part and the steering wheel appeared.&nbsp;But even without a chassis, a simple convertible could have been built from a couple of bricks and plates.&nbsp;If you have the box, there is a version on the back of the box between the alternative builds where you can put the minifigure on the vehicle.</p>

<h3>My mod</h3>

<p>I quickly built another car that also consists of a few parts. The point is to be able to put the minifigure in it.</p>

<p>Something from the late 1970s angular sports car like the Lotus Esprit&nbsp;or the Triumph TR7.</p>

<p>And I didn&rsquo;t even need a chassis part for that. These parts were also available in 1978.</p>
