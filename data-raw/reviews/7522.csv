It has two red spaceguys both with handy walkie-talkies, and for the price it was offered at, this set was an awesome deal. A low building experience, as it has just two minifigures, it has a high playability score. Also, this is a spectacular set if you get a lot of them, as I did. You could get basically a whole squad of the astronauts for your moon base. I loved this set as a kid and you can probably still get it today exclusively on eBay or something. There is not much to the packaging, but not much is necessary for what it contains. Overall, I will give it a 5 out of 5.</p>
