The color scheme of red and black with a pop of yellow works for me. A propeller is included which is the only other specialty part in the set besides the printed slope. The design of the model is lacking and looks like a giveaway from a happy meal toy. I would love to go in to a McDonald's and buy a Happy Meal with a LEGO toy in it, not a Bionicle like they are giving away presently.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
