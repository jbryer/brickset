When I got home from Christmas in Vegas, the first thing I did was pop this game in my Wii and started rocking out.</p><p>&nbsp;When you start off you build a minifigure of yourself. Thought there are limited choices at first, your character changes quite a bit. I've gone from having <a href=""http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/3626bp01"">Bob's head</a> (the standard minifigure) with a green t-shirt to having a Power Miner Engineer's head and a tan jacket. Not only can you customize yourself, but you can customize just about anything- your band members (which I named after real life friends), your instruments, and your rock den- a place exclusive to LEGO Rock Band (I think) where you just hang out and chill and make it your own.</p><p>The story mode of the game is also quite cool too- you start off by auditioning, and then you start rocking out. Like most bands you start off small, by playing at a Subway station, but eventually you play in sold out stadiums! You also unlock something called a rock power challenge later on- different stuff happens in each one- in one of them, you have to knock down a building with rock and roll, in another you have to stop an asteroid from crashing into an alien colony, and et cetera.</p><p>The people who made this game made it so everyone could play- they added a new difficulty where all you need to do is strum, and it's impossible to fail too- when you lose all of your power on your rock meter you simply enter stud recovery mode where you simply try to win back your lost points. The only exception is rock power challenges when you can fail. But don't let this feature keep you from buying the game- there are difficulties for the advanced. Another thing they did was added a feature where you can tell the drums to automatically do the foot petal, which is nice because I'm not as&nbsp;coordinated&nbsp;on the drums as I am on guitar, so with that I can actually get 5 stars on drums.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall this game is fantastic and is a load of fun. When you see this game, go and pick it up- the game's a blast, and it's a lot of fun to see the manliest of your manly friends singing ""Walking on Sunshine."" =)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
