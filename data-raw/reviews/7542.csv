"BIONICLEGuy","2010-09-14T11:55:17.863Z","WOW!","Out of all the DS games that I owned/played/tested at some point LEGO Rockband is second only to Sonic &amp; SEGA All Stars Racing (whew)! If this wasn't LEGO it would be Band Hero on the DS without that funny little grip controller that goes in the Pak slot (good, 'cause I own a DSi, and a DSi has no Pak slot), and Band Hero is one of the greatest games of all time.<p>First, you can make your own player. LEGO, we should see more of this you know, Harry Potter on Xbox 360 had a nice system for make custom players but this is the best custom tool you are going to get on DS (The two Indy games only allowed you to make two, yes TWO players, while Rockband gives you double that!), mind you, there wasn't a huge choice for a lad my age and that annoyed me.</p><p>On the plus side the song choice is amazing. We Will Rock You (plus playing as Queen in Quickplay), Ghostbusters, Kung Fu Fighting and The Final Countdown? Um ,fill your boots.</p><p>I want a word with the guy who came up with the control system.........pure genius! The way you use left, right X &amp; A instead of the classic all-D-Pad system (left, up, right &amp; down) is really clever!</p><p>Last year LEGO Rockband was tucked away in the corner at E3. I managed to get tickets due to my uncle who works for E3. I tested it out (using the DSi XL and also on PSP Go) and on DS it was so good I wanted to buy it myself! The only reason I tested it on PSP is I was making a test on which new handheld was best (DSi XL won!) and it was utterly rubbish!</p><p>Because of testing LEGO Rockband at E3 I got it as a present for myself for my birthday. Sadly I went to HMV and they were not only going fast, they were also not going cheap. Luckily I had £50 in my pocket and grabbed a second hand copy of Mario &amp; Sonic At The Olympic games while I was there. (NOTE- LEGO Rockband cost £40 and the second-hand game cost £2)</p><p>So, a nice game, nice controls but not a nice price. The End.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,4
