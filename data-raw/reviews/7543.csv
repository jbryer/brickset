This game has great songs and even greater locations! You can rock out in a crystal mine, on a pirate ship, in a creepy mansion, and many other exotic locations! There's also TONS of customization! 
You can unlock items to trick out your minifigs and your ""Rock Den"". You can even hire staff to multiply your earned studs after each round. You get to BUILD your way to stardom 
(pun intended)! This game is not too easy, but not too hard either. The only thing I don't like is how the minifigures sometimes appear to be orange, not yellow. Anyways, I highly recommend this game!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

in my experience with lego video games, the focus is never on the actual building aspect of legos.  this is no exception.  nothing to build except a reputation with fans.

the gameplay is just like other rock band versions:  2 guitars (usually one of them is a bass, sometimes it's a rhythm guitar), drums and a mic for singing.  my set didn't come with any of these, i had them already.

the only real lego aspect of the game comes from customizing the minifig band members and decorating their pad.  there are lots of different heads/torsos/hair/leg combinations to play around with.  also you can purchase and unlock instruments to customize your band look.

the song selection is pretty decent.  it seems like it may have been made up of rejected songs for the main rock band games.  some songs just don't work well with a band based game (most notably ""we will rock you"" by queen.  awesome song, but mostly just stomping and clapping with a cool guitar solo).  the songs seem to fit each of the lego themed venues.

this game has it's own set of downloadable songs.  some of my rockband 1/2 downloaded songs don't appear in  the available song list for lego rockband.  the game came with a code that would enable ALL of the lego rockband songs to be played in regular rockband.  there was a 10 dollar fee to unlock this.

a couple features that i think are really awesome for this game:  impossible to fail and super easy mode.  this game is geared towards young children.   where you would fail in the traditional game, this one lets you buy your way back to a winning score by paying up a few studs (the equivalent of money in the game).  this happens on the fly, and doesn't require and doesn't require the player to stop the song.  also, super easy mode comes in real handy for younger kids and rhythm challenged grandparents.  it doesn't require you to actually hit the correct buttons, you just have to do something (ANYTHING!).

all in all, it's a pretty fun game.  it's great for a group, not too bad playing by yourself.  ",FALSE,5,1,1,5,5
