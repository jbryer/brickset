<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what better game to have then one that combines a love for the Guitar Hero/Rock Band and LEGO style of games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's got many features found in Rock Band and Guitar Hero for customizing a character, the band's pad, new instruments. The playability is much like the Rock Band &amp; Guitar Hero experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The music videos when playing a ""boss song"" are just fun to watch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't like Rock Band &amp; Guitar Hero, you probably won't like this. If you haven't been playing any of the LEGO games, then you can miss this. But if you have been, it's well worth the price.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,4
