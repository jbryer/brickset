Pros:
1 new mask
2 nice weapon design 
3 Mask does not get twisted up unlike the original piraka
4 resembles original piraka very well

Cons:
1 cannot bend knees or elbows
2 least pieces of all of the bionicle stars",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KJM72","2009-12-05T10:09:15.577Z","Not As Good as it's Made Out to Be","Piraka is actually a pretty bland set in real life.

His build is boring as usual. I wish there was something more in this set to make the build a little more bearable, but it lacks the armor that Tahu and Gresh (see my reviews) have.

There are a few interesting pieces, including the limbs and the spine. The sping could be used interestingly in MOCing, but it doesn't work well with the set. It might just be my set, or the way I attached it, but it resticts head movement. Whenever you try to move his head, it goes back up to a weird position.

Another strange part of the set is the weapon. It makes me wonder why LEGO chose this odd looking sickle, all while leaving the other hand awkwardly empty handed.

Also worth mentioning is that this set has the least amount of pieces of all the Stars.

.:Pros:.
-Spine might be interesting as a MOCing piece
-Recolored legs
-Gold Piece

.:Cons:.
-Stifff head piece
-Odd weapon
-Overall Awkward look
-Empty hand",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"deadtree103","2009-12-29T00:42:37.06Z","Better than expected.","If you read my reviews alot, you might notice that I like to reveiw the underdog sets alot(Sets that are generally disliked). But anyway. I got this set with Stars Gresh and the Coast Gaurd helicopter(Review coming soon)for Christmas, I wasn't expecting much, seeing as most reviews deemed it unworthy of purchase, but I was planning to get it anyway. Anyway, The spine is really nice, I won't Say anything about the Can(For that you'll have to read my Tahu review). Now that I have him and Gresh, I only need 109 more sets to complete my Bionicle Collection!

PROS :)
*Another Antroz blade(Wich is a really nice weapon).
*The Avgori Armor in Gold looks SWEET.
*The other two types of Avgori limbs in Dark Blue.
*Looks good, the box pose really is unflattering.

CONS :(
*Box pose sucks.
*Glagori head, I think he should've had an Av-matoran head.

One of my favorite sets now. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"michaelvader","2010-01-31T18:23:01.217Z","I have never had a date before but, I am NOT ugly!","This guy is really cool! If you saw the commercial This guy was in the FINAL BATTLE with Tahu and the Golden Armor! That was so cool. OK so The build was fairly simple.( A little too simple if you ask me). And everybody thinks the new head piece is ugly. Well here are 2 words from Nekktan or whatever,""SHUT UP!"" Because its not that ugly.

The weapon though is kinda boring. The top piece is new to me so I still like it. One of the bad things is that the arm pieces and leg pieces can get mixed up so be careful! 

overall I really like this set so 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Speninator","2009-12-26T18:02:38.653Z","Juniorizatian","Sets that have 19 or less pieces  are so stupid. is it because lego has new baby fans? it seems like it.

This set is okay if you ignore its juniorization.
it has the new hand pieces, clawed feet, it has a huge blade for fighting. Its spine is actually rubbery, like the piraka of 2006. it has a cool head , cool designs and a mouth so unrealistic it 's terrible.

other than all that, it is cool, than you should buy it for the armor and to collect. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"CadKatarn14","2009-12-26T15:29:30.123Z","Good Set","When i first saw the picture of the box and figure, i tought it wouldnt be that great or interesting. As I built it and finished it i realized it was a very good set, one of my favorites.

Pros:
Looks great
Claw feet
gold piece 
nice head

Cons:
not very many weapons
kind of short

Overall, it is a great set that exceeded my expectations, i hope you enjoy it if you do purchase him.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>This is the first time that Nektann has been released as the warlord, A robotic Nektann, (The missle/cannon launcher),&nbsp;was released in 2006, In the Piraka Outpost set.</p>
<p>Don't complain that he has one Cresent scythe, He was going to have two. So&nbsp;stop complaining.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Antroz weapon and Electro-blade&nbsp;design of Cresent scythe</li>
    <li>New Skakdi spine piece</li>
    <li>Dark Blue Av-Matoran Solek legs/arms&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Glatorian head. He's a Skakdi, not a Glatorian.</li>
    <li>Teeth, he has none. The Six Rouge Dark Hunters, who called themselfs Piraka, had them. It is a trait of Skakdi to have teeth</li>
    <li>Eyes, again, The Piraka had awesome eyes. He doesn't</li>
    <li>Av-Matoran design, ONLY GOOD FOR AV-MATORAN</li>
    <li>His design just looks awkward&nbsp;for him.</li>
    <li>He is small. I know he is a &quot;Stars&quot; set, But he should at least be at a Skakdi height, He is miniscule compaired to a Skakdi.</li>

"benjadude11","2010-02-08T19:19:55.373Z","Vezok? really?","I can think of no bionicle subtheme more deserving of a representative in the all-star cast than the piraka. they were my favorite bionicles by far, and they really deserve to be part of the group. my only beef with this set is vezok. Why base the rep for the all stars on one of the worst piraka? Thok, the white piraka, was my favorite set ever. yeah you heard me. EVER. So what's up with vezok? no matter. lets focus on the present with some pros and cons.

Pros:
nice spine
iron-man head
good feet
good legs
little used weapon

Cons:
vezok?
no chest armor

Overall, this guy is the fifth best star, ahead of only Skrall. It's okay though. He's still a 5 star set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The Bad: Only one claw, overpriced, and hard to pose the arms and head.

If you want, you can just make him have two daggers instead of a double sided blade. The spikes on his neck and back are cool as well.",FALSE,4,4,2,3,3
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-18T12:57:59.55Z","One Step Closer to Owning the Golden Toa","<p>Set #7137 Piraka: Once again I have a Bionicle Stars figure to review. Despite what some might say I have no problem with the Bionicle Stars sets being our last look at the Bionicle Mythos. They all stand up quite nicely on the shelf and offer for some great playability and poseability. If I have but one complaint it is that they take so little time to build, so building them up isn't as much fun as it could be, but that doesn't detract too much from the sets in the long run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Piraka is an interesting looking character with some nice pieces,&nbsp;I espeically like the large head piece with the rubber tendrils sticking off of his back, this way they won't snap when you pose his arms and the spiky looking design is quite menacing looking for a villain. Although it is difficult to get the fully built Piraka back into the tube case as I found out, because of the spiky parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though you won't be dissapointed in any of the Bionicle Stars if you're looking for some small Bionicle kits to put on display as opposed to the larger ones, or just to have some mock battles and fun time playing out scenes that would never happen in the actual story. I mean I don't think Tahu would fight Piraka or Takanuva would fight Skrall, but hey who cares. It's fun. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
