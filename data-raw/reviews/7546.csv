 The canister is the same quality as the larger canisters, but only a little bit larger than the agori boxes. The design on top of the canister is the maze on the skrall shield. On the back, it says you can make a gold accented tahu with the spare gold piece from all six of the sets. The gold piece in this set is a round bohorok shield. The two new pieces in the set are the rakashi's head and spine ( which are connected), and the translucent orange piece under his head. The yellow pieces are the same hue as Mata Nui's armor.

What could be wrong with it?"". Well, I was off a bit. The stick is annoying because it has limited movement options (Except for stab, hang, and a few others). The price is not really perfect, $5 USD would be best, but oh well. Good enough. Here are the Ps and Cs (instead of Qs and As):

Pros:

1. Semi-good price
2. Gold shield is a good and rare piece to build Golden Bionicle
3. Intimidating look
4. Posable, including head can turn far to look to side
5. Sturdy, pieces stay together very well

Cons:
1. Stick has limited movements, being 3 different pieces connected to fists
2. Head can't look down, just straight, to the side (Sorta), or up

All in all, 3.5/5 is the best rating for this set. The mask is connected to the spines, which connect to the back. This may need some help with building. Make sure you DO NOT lose the gold parts, these are important.

<p>Now having no idea what Bionicle was all about and about to purchase one, why did I choose Rahkshi? Well first of all the character design itself is quite nice. With nothing to base on except the boxart, the pose itself just won me over. Secondly the colors, good combination of black(which i later realized is actually dark grey) and yellow. Last is the weapon, which is like a bo staff ending with spears on both ends.</p>
<p>After playing with it for two days, I realized the bionicle series is really a gem. There's so much playability. The Stars series are smaller than previous series, but to me it is just the right size. I incorporate it into my City sets and have it standing on rooftops terrorizing civilians, and it didn't felt out of place.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T21:04:13.1Z","Bionicle Stars a Last Gasp before the end","<p>Set # 7138 Rahkshi: I just purchased this set a few days ago from Wal-Mart on sale for 5$ CND. I have wanted to pick up the Bionicle Stars to showcase the Bionicle series for my collection because they aren't as expensive to get as the others. Now all I need is the other five to complete the whole set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to review: Rahkshi represents the villains from the first full-length Bionicle Movie (Which I have.) and the third group of villains, with Bohrok being second and the first villains basically just being over-grown animals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new parts for this set are very new to me - I collected the Bionicle figures back when they first came out and always wished they had proper looking hands, now these Bionicle Stars use new pieces. Real looking Hands and everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bionicle is of course Technic related and much of the building involves parts that normal Lego Theme sets don't use - they are not scaled for Mini-Figure use - unless you decide to stretch your imagination a little. The newer Bionicles from this, the final wave of Bionicle figures before Hero Factory starts are using less pieces than ever before, Lego made some really interesting looking parts and design choices for these little sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like it. There may be some who find flaws with it, but for 5$ I can't really argue with the neat factor and the impressive choices that the engineers made in order to give us a full representation of all the factions in this universe. I look forward to picking up the other six to complete my Bionicle Stars Collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend this to any Bionicle fans who don't mind cutting corners or twenty second builds. I also recommend it to any fans who have been sitting on the fence about it. And the yellow coloring just adds to the impressiveness of this model. At least in my eyes.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

"Palmpou","2014-03-23T19:22:01.317Z","Thoughtless reboot and not you should get","<p>I do not actually own the set, but found the unopened box in one of my good friends houses and we opened it together and built it.</p>

<p>Let me get this over with right now for people who are simply want a verdict.</p>

<p>This set is VERY bad, not worth the money, not worth the time.</p>

<p>I am not sure why so many people review saying how excellent it is, but I completely think otherwise, and here is why.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A: The price.</p>

<p>This set is supposed to be a reboot of an old one no? So why is it, that with only half the parts of predesscesor, it costs so much more?</p>

<p>B: Piece quality.</p>

<p>The pieces included in the set are very VERY poor. They are only utilized for set and set alone. They are irregular shapes, hard to interface with other lego pieces, and in the case of our set, did not have consistent color among the yellow pieces, what with being different shades of yellow. Also included a random piece whose only purpose was to be put on another model.</p>

<p>C: Construction.</p>

<p>It is very easy. With so few pieces, a complete lack of ingenuity and lack of &#39;small&#39; parts, it could be pieced even without the manual.</p>

<p>D: Playability.</p>

<p>The set actually does have a strong point. Because of how simple it is, it can easily be tossed, thrown around, posed, and still be fine. Has an articulating neck and all, and even if pieces come of, they are very easy to reattach. However, it still doesnt really do more than just posable action figure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now for my personal spin.</p>

<p>Along with the original toa sets, I picked up the original rahkshi up because of its gearbox pieces and joints (because I build suspensions with lego pieces). However, I bought two so I could actually construct one of them instead of cannibalize it. And let me tell you, it was a blast. Articulating heads, bestial head, stubby little arms and massive feet combined to make something threatening and imposing. It was easy to build and charming because of the gearbox shoulder (which although was really simple and lackluster was still fun), popping spine, and interlocking pieces that fit together beautifully. It had good build integrity and strength (I could throw it around all over the place with no fear) and it was just fun!. It also came with a neat little micro cd which gave you an awesome bit of cg footage, a set of pretty dumb desktop backgrounds and some music too. Not only that, all of its pieces could be easily used with the lego technique system allowing me to make some pretty cool things (INCLUDING MY FIRST DOUBLE WISHBONE =D ). They also could combine into a weird monster centauer or other things if you wanted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All that for less money than this tripe. The new rakshi set has no redeeming features whatsoever, not one. Go on old toy stores and find one of the six old ones if you want a rahkshi. There is far more value and fun packed into that 2003 set this rubbish thing.</p>

<p>Even if I look at the set alone, it still suffers from the fact its pieces are very hard to use with other lego parts and how much it costs for so few pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

"ArchOnua85","2021-11-10T00:45:03.723Z","Before They Say Goodbye","<p>So the &quot;Stone&quot; element of the Stars series turned out to be the Rakshis. Yes, Makuta&#39;s 2nd&nbsp;oldest minions, only predated&nbsp;by the Bohroks (which were not featured after 2003). So how does it stand up?</p>

<p>You know it&#39;s not going to be a positive review when I have my criticism covers the entire product&#39;s aspects in one go. Because the Stars series tend to be scaled-down takes on the most beloved icons, pretty much everything suffered as a result. The already repetitively anaemic building experience now struck a whole new low, although I have to admit attaching the spine is a little unusual. But besides, this feels much like the original run of Hero Factory because it indeed predated the 2010 models. And by this point, I am not too nice on Hero Factory.</p>

<p>Back to the topic, you&nbsp;would think playability would remain at 2 out of 5, but while I never played with an original 2003 Rakshi (I will however), I remember my Stars Rakshi being rigid by size, unlike the older Rakshis who are so tall you have more leverage for the swings. With this said, alongside with&nbsp;parts, it is humble to slam an 1 out of 5.</p>

<p>Regarding the value for the money, it&#39;s not the best ... but it&#39;s not the worse either. 30 dollars in 2021 is tremendously cheap, but its&nbsp;features are already sub-par, so 2 out of 5.</p>

<p>In all honesty, maybe I am unfair in my reviews. After all, others reviewers&nbsp;pretty much always tend to have much nicer things to say than I do. And yeah, there is the &quot;Golden Armor&quot; collection making the stars Rakshi mandatory. But while all my loose parts are going to be&nbsp;donated, there are&nbsp;no ways I would buy it again, as&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t make sense to me when I keep&nbsp;the golden shield with me and plan to acquire Panrahk.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The STARS line came in small cans, which features caps in the colors of the respective sets. The RoHV&#39;s&nbsp;canister had a picture of the creature, a yellow cap, and the basic set info/parts count/age. I don&#39;t remember the instructions for either of my Rahkshi, but I got two with no misprints.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Mostly grey and yellow parts,and most of the pieces came from the 2008 Av-Matoran. The staff came from 8590 Guurahk, the blue Rahkshi in 2003. The yellow pieces are the main excluive pieces, with a custom head mold. Two Shadow Matoran feet are included in yellow, as are two hand, which can be found on 8989 Mata Nui.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This was SO easy, only slightly harder than an Av-Matoran, which were some of the easiest BIONICLE sets ever.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks pretty nice! The RoHV is a cool little set, which makes a good miniaturized version of the original versions. There are no features whatsoever, other than hand/arm/leg/foot/head (somewhat) articulation.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The RoHV&nbsp;is a nice set, although there are some serious flaws (no Kraata, Guurahk staff, etc). I would say get it for parts, or if you&#39;re a collector. It&#39;s not a must have set.</p>

I know that Bionicle STARS certainly isn&#39;t revered by fans, but this set has managed to hold a special place in my heart. Out of the six sets from that wave, this one is still my go-to favorite.</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Parts: Shadow Matoran feet are new in yellow, the Bohrok Kal shield is new in gold,&nbsp;and the 08&#39; mould eye piece is new in translucent red. The rubber head piece is a new part altogether.</p>

<p>Overall look: This is arguably the best looking set from the STARS line. The extra leg piece used as a neck piece looks passable in this set. I also like how this set introduces a seventh Rahkshi type in yellow.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Poor limb movement.</p>

<p>Head movement is very limited because of the rubber head piece.</p>

<p>Low complexity: The figure is made of 17 parts.</p>
