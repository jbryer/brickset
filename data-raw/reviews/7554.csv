"nasalegojedi","2009-11-30T21:45:05.09Z","A Great Game!","I got this game when it came out, and boy, was it worth it. I just love the lego series of games, and this makes a great addition to the franchise. The movies are divided into play sets, which are open hubs that you can explore at your will. The first 3 movies each have one set, and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has 3 sets (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3). The sets are further divided into 5 story levels, 5 treasure levels, 5 bonus levels, and one super bonus level. To access the treasure levels, you have to first complete the story levels, and to access the bonus levels, you have to find them across the hub. To access the super bonus level, you have to complete all the treasure and bonus levels, and build a contraption that will send you to the super bonus level.

The hubs are huge and there are many things to do. The hubs are so huge they add a new feature-airplanes! When you exit them you parachute down to whatever lies below. You have to use them to reach some otherwise remote location. The levels are short, and most can be completed in 5-10 minutes. To get 100% (still getting there) you have to also get the True Adventurer award. To do that you must colect a certain number of studs. Studs are the main currency of the game, and you must use to unlock useful vehicles and characters. The graphics of the game are amazing on the Xbox 360, truly shining. 

There is another new feature in the game: a level builder. Although not my favorite feature (which is the giant hubs), the level builder is really fun to play around with. The bad thing is you can't share and try out other peoples levels. Character creator does return (starting in Lego Star Wars 2) but nothing new about that.

I give this game a high rating because of all the reasons mentioned. So go buy or order this game right now!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legobagel","2010-10-15T14:39:56.973Z","TERRIBLE GAME","<p>LEGO Indiana jones 2: The Adventure Continues is one of those games you can find cheap, recive as a present , borrow it off a friend or buy it for the achievements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i recivce this for christmas along with&nbsp;l4D 2 , forza motorsport 3 and batman: arkham asylum (along with a bunch of lego sets) however this was the least favorite of the bunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE plot:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the plot is basically the same as the 4 indiana jones, however the first 3 movies don't include the key secnces from the movie where as the first game did. you also can get to go to hubs where you can drive vecheils and do challenges but these hubs are way too&nbsp; big. altough a new feature was a build your own level option which was nice and also a new spiltscreen 2 player option which was also cool</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building expierence:</p>
<p>there is no build at all its a game not a set</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts:</p>
<p>you get instuctions and the game disc </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>playability:</p>
<p>a find the game playably but i don't enjoy playing it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vaule for money:</p>
<p>35 pounds it costs and what a rip off</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>overall:terrbile game DO NOT BUY</p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
