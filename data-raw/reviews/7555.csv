pros: The kingdom of the crystal skull game is in this game.

cons: One island can be three or two parts. Like cairo and nepal and the nazis base are seperated by two bridges.

"Legomaniac2","2009-12-15T04:54:19.547Z","Awsome","This game is so cool it is so cool I think this game is better than the orginal wich I have clocked to 100%.

Pros: level builder 
super bonus levels (have to be earned)
New cars boat and plane first timer

Cons:
A bit to much crystal skull ( but it was an aok movie better than alot of movies)

Misses some important levels that were in the first game.

But other than that this game is the bomb or more like whip.
100/5
