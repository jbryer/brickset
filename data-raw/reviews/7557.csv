I think the coolest thing about it is that it introduces levels from the new&nbsp;Indiana Jones&nbsp;movie, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" I also like the enhanced levels from the first 3 Indy movies and the new style of gameplay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pro's:</p>
<p>-Introduces levels from Indy 4!</p>
<p>-Enhanced levels from the first Lego Indiana Jones game!</p>
<p>-Able to actually build your own levels and adventures!</p>
<p>-New unique style of gameplay!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Con's:</p>
<p>-A few levels from the previous lego indy game are taken out or replaced.</p>
<p>-Other then that, NONE in my opinion.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<ul>
<li>Levels for the new movie 
<li>New levels for for the first movies</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has multiple&nbsp;problems. 
<li>For example: one player is said to be there, but can't play, 
<li>you can't change characters, 
<li>you have to leave the game to fix it temporarily, 
<li>if you drop out, you can't get back in, 
<li>or you can't use the pause menu, 
<li>some story scenes replay themselves. 
<li></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has new levels, but because of the&nbsp;problems in the system, don't waste your money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recommend that you do NOT purchase this game, but&nbsp;if you&nbsp;want more info look up the game and read the reviews.</p>",TRUE,2,1,1,1,1
"Odeinoichus","2017-01-05T18:29:07.187Z","An Unimpressive Sequel with Flaws.","<p><strong>LEGO Indiana Jones 2 The Adventures Continue:</strong> This is a first for me, but I actually did not enjoy this title as much as any of the other LEGO Video Games. Traveler&rsquo;s Tales made, quite frankly, a series of odd decisions that altered the game to the point where a lot of the fun of past titles were erased and it became more a chore to finish it compared to other titles.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>This title has shorter levels, six separate hub worlds, breaking up the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull into three sections. The fourth film receives the lion&rsquo;s share of the work here, with longer levels and more to do. The three older titles have been completely changed, all of the levels from the original game were scrapped and new, sometimes shorter levels, were created with an emphasis on more boss battles and less exploration or puzzle solving.</p>

<p>Accessing each hub world was done from the main menu with fun looking LEGO box designs for each area. Everything looked great, unfortunately I don&rsquo;t feel this title did what it was meant to as far as representing the franchise very well. It suffers a lot from strange choices and a load of other developments that mostly hindered the game play in my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Game Play</strong></p>

<p>This title is vastly different from the original. Improving slightly on the number of things to do, but reducing the length of levels and creating entire new content for the first three original films results in some interesting changes to how the game is played.</p>

<p>Many levels have two versions, the main story level and then an alternative variation that involves puzzles or some sort of vehicle quest. Free Play mode as it was originally presented is also around, but there isn&rsquo;t much reason for venturing into it as the puzzles are easily solved for the most part on a first play through. Only unique characters are required for certain puzzles.</p>

<p>Like with Harry Potter level creation game play was included in this title, and just like with LEGO Harry Potter the feature is poorly executed and serves very little purpose aside from finishing your gold brick collection and achieving 100% in the game. It lacks functionality and fails miserably at capturing the fun of building with LEGO Bricks.</p>

<p>My biggest complaint however is how the hub worlds are treated. In this title and this title alone you can only use the characters from each hub world in their respective areas, you can&rsquo;t take someone from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull into Temple of Doom. You can&rsquo;t access a character wheel to solve all of the hub world puzzles with anyone you&rsquo;ve unlocked and you can&rsquo;t explore very much of the Hub World. It is not as vast as some of the Hub Worlds found in more recent games, such as Jurassic World or The Force Awakens.</p>

<p>Overall I was very disappointed with the game play here, while the basics remained the same there were far too many changes that hindered the enjoyment of the game compared to past and future releases. Therefore&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t recommend this game as much as others. The original title actually handled like a LEGO Video Game. This version incorporates odd program changes, very unusual decisions for the title and takes away a lot of the fun compared to the previous title. There is no true hub world here, instead you have a grouping of hub worlds that are small and limit what you can take inside of them, forcing you to work only with characters and vehicles that you wind up with during the game play.</p>

<p>I feel Traveler&rsquo;s Tales might benefit from revisiting this universe and hope that if rumors persist and a fifth film is in the works that LEGO will bring us a brand new third installment that features a much better execution. I&rsquo;m actually surprised that they did not try to pursue the Indiana Jones Young Adventures Television Series, it would have given them more to do with this universe, however I suspect since the Theme has been retired for a while that it makes sense this game franchise is forced to rely on these two titles.</p>

"123MrBrick","2015-06-24T19:46:07.687Z","The first one is better...","<p>This game is okay. I left all ratings at 3 because that is my overall score of the game.</p>

<h3>The Hub</h3>

<p>There are several hubs in this game, one for each movie. They are kind of limited and the camera angles are bad.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>Gameplay is mediocre. There are a few different level types for every movie. The car ones are the most fun because you can ram enemies off of cliffsides. The best mode, however, is the level builder. You can play any character from a limited pool and build a level with tons of bricks, vehicles, enemies, traps, and more.</p>

<h3>Characters</h3>

<p>There aren&#39;t a lot of characters. A good chunk of them are boring generics, and some of them are nearly impossible to unlock.</p>

<h3>Other thoughts</h3>

<p>The game glitches and freezes a lot. You need to save your level builder progress frequently or you will lose it. The first three movies have been remade for this game with the new mechanics, and they are a lot worse. Crystal Skull is annoyingly split into two parts.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this game is worse than the first Indiana Jones game, which was fairly simple. You should only get it if you are a die-hard Indy fan or if you want to use the level builder.</p>

"ICAbricks","2022-03-06T00:43:19.013Z","The Most Underrated LEGO Game Ever","<p>This is definitely my favourite LEGO videogame, and I hate it when people get mad at it. I started playing this during Quarantine, and I got hooked. I definitely like it a lot. I&#39;m going to organize some of my thoughts about it:</p>

<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>

<p>I was overall pretty satisfied with the gameplay on this one. Having levels with challenges to solve is something that remains true among LEGO games since 2005. What is interesting is that there are actually four categories of levels.</p>

<p>Basic: These are the basic levels, where you solve problems to reach the end. I always love a good level like this.</p>

<p>Enemies: This is where you bash up waves of enemies to complete the level. The concept is neat, something that could be interesting to see in a LEGO Star Wars game.</p>

<p>Vehicles: Kind of like the Enemies levels, but with waves of vehicles instead of minifigures. This is probably the only part of the game I don&#39;t like. The vehicles you drive in don&#39;t handle well, and the levels are so hard that I sometimes have to quit the level and try it again another day. So, don&#39;t really like those ones.</p>

<p>Boss: There are some boss levels where you just try to take away an enemy&#39;s hearts, and then there are the final bosses, which are super freaking awesome. The bosses aren&#39;t really realistic to the movies at all (except Belloq Battle - the Angel of Death boss is super awesome!), but it&#39;s still really cool.</p>

<p>There are also 5 bonus levels hidden around, as well as 5 Treasure Levels, where you go back into a level to complete a challenge with different characters. At the end of each Bonus/Treasure Level, you get an Artifact (kinda like the ones in the Original Adventures), and once you collect all 10, you can enter a Super Bonus Level, where you try to collect one million studs as fast as you can.</p>

<p><strong>Open World:</strong></p>

<p>The Adventures Continue probably has my favorite open-world gameplay of any LEGO game I&#39;ve played so far. Each movie has it&#39;s own special hub (something I&#39;d love to see applied to a LEGO Jurassic World sequel). The hubs are big enough that they have lots of stuff to do, but small enough that you can keep track of your location somewhat easily. And what most people may not realise is that the hubs in this game paved the way for LEGO Lord of the Rings, LEGO Jurassic World, and even the much anticipated Skywalker Saga. You can find characters and vehicles to buy, and even win special vehicle&nbsp;races to unlock new characters (although some of these said races can be frustrating - I once spent half an hour on a motorcycle race). But still, the hub worlds are fun to explore around in for studs and other stuff.</p>

<p><b>Characters:</b></p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly pleased with the character selection on this game. Some characters from the first game are missing (what happened to Chattar Lal?), but it&#39;s still a good cast. There&#39;s also a character customizer in the Creator box, but the screen resolution is somewhat poor, meaning that some characters may not turn out quite right if you don&#39;t have a focused eye. But still, the characters is something I&#39;m overall fine with. Just wish we had gotten more small-hatch characters.</p>

<p><strong>Level Builder:</strong></p>

<p>This is my favourite part of the game by far. You can go into the Creator box and make your own level. You do have to buy the props and such, but after getting the stud multipliers and doing tons of Super Bonus Levels, the 5,000 stud price isn&#39;t that bad at all. You can place sockets that allow you to connect gates, hazards, and other stuff to levers and switches in order to activate them. This was, as far as I know, the first licensed LEGO game to feature a level builder. I definitely hope to see a level builder in a future Star Wars game. That would be awesome!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, overall, this is a game that I actually really like. It jumpstarted the open worlds in some of the newer LEGO games. It had lots of fun gameplay, especially the epic final bosses! And it has the first LEGO level builder, which is something I want to see in future LEGO games. And that is why I like this game so much.&nbsp;</p>
