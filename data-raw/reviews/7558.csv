"Darthleapyous","2010-03-21T03:14:27.843Z","Love it!","<p>i beged my dad to get this for me (with my own money) and he got it.as soon as you select new game there's a&nbsp;cutscene (it has good graphics) where indy and marion are on a plane and all his enemies are on it,mola ram attacks indy and makes pages of his journel fly out.&nbsp;mola ram&nbsp;accidentely opened the door. All of indys enemys fly out of the door to the island below.Indy gets a boat but marion gets some parachutes and they land on the island.you get to action strait away.you eventually get to a bay with a hut&nbsp;where you&nbsp;&nbsp;perchase characters, extras etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>theres a big door that opens and you go through it,thats where you get the journel pages you lost.the first one unlocks kingdom of the crystal skull,it has 12 levels.you can also get minigames for all 4 movies (but no levels for the first 3 movies one).here are the pros (no cons)</p>

I bought this game in hopes of making levels, and laughing at my friends for failing the level. Well that is not happening anytime soon. But still the game is very well made. The thing I don't get: Why is there a whole montage and you have to travel the island for new mini levels. I have not finished since I don't play it that much anymore.&nbsp;Overall a good 4\5! The lego company should make a third and advertise for what's actually on the game. And it stinks you cannot always use your whip.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
