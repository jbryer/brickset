You have a variety of models to build - three of them come with instructions and detailed pictures of up to seven models in total.  The three detailed builds are fairly easy and quick to throw together, no real taxing methods.

The first model is a very neat red sportster car, very nice, until you put the minifig in it and it looks like a Noddy Car.  The Minifig is just too big.  The second model is a blue truck - nothing special, a tad ugly.  The third model is the petrol pump - again perfuncturary rather than stylish.

Pros:
Broom
Dustbin
Rope Piece
Printed tile - possible use as computer screen
Light green cap
Plenty of colours - orange, light green, dark green, red arch pieces, blue.
Lots of spare pieces

Cons:
Scaling of models
Apart from the first model, everything lacks a certain elan.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Night_City_Dream","2010-02-16T06:01:48.7Z","Classic town has come back!","<p>I bought this set for 380 roubles in Russia as soon as I noticed it. It comes with a nice CITY minifigure. What I also like is that the car has wheels that are more to scale but it would have been even better if they had put old type tyres.</p>
<p>Overall, the set reminds me much of old TOWN sets in the 1990s. Good proportions, good sizes, interesting parts. The set will very well fit into any town / city scene.</p>
<p>I also would like to highlight the value for money: the set per piece is very well priced.</p>
<p>So, I'd recommend this set to any city/town fan.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
"meyerc13","2010-10-31T02:43:37Z","Best set in this series!","There are so many great things about this set it is hard to find a place to begin.&nbsp; Let's start with the piece count - 139.&nbsp; For the price, that's an incredible number of pieces.&nbsp; The pieces themselves are also extremely useful.&nbsp; You get a printed computer screen, string with end studs, 8 wheels and tires, 4 axles, two different windshields, a good selection of small plates, a garbage can, and a broom.&nbsp; The wheels/tires/axles are something you can never have too many of, so it's great that this set comes with so many.<br><br>You have enough pieces to build two vehicles and a gas pump.&nbsp; The frames of the vehicles are brick built, reminding me of the sets in the 80's when I was a kid.&nbsp; The blue truck is okay, but nothing special.&nbsp; The red car is really nice but being a classic 4 wide style is a bit small.&nbsp; However, even in the real world there are tiny 2 seat roadsters so this car has found a place in my Lego City.&nbsp; The gas pump is nice but basic.&nbsp; The colors are almost Octan colors, but not quite, but that is easy enough to change.<br><br>The minifig looks like a mechanic, but as others have mentioned his torso is like the torso of the figure in the 7638 Tow Truck, *not* an Octan torso.&nbsp; Also, you'll notice that you get parts for two vehicles but only one minifig.&nbsp; That's easily fixed if you also pick up the 5899 House Building Set which has two minifigs and one car.<br><br>Overall this is a great set.&nbsp; There is a ton of play value in the configuration as pictured, and the pieces are extremely useful if you would rather use them to make your own creation.&nbsp; Pick this set up, you won't be disappointed.&nbsp; In fact, pick up two because you can definitely find uses for these pieces.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"NickBrick","2010-07-04T20:28:07.28Z","I agree,much like classic town","I had just been given my spring 2010 catalog and when I got to the section called bricks and more I just about turned the page[Because Duplo was also on the page]then something caught my eye.The words 9.99$ and 139 peices.From then on I am all ways on the lookout for more set from bricks and more.First off the set is great for starting a little town and eventully a city.the is not as bad the other guy said it is quite awesome.The car does look a little silly when you put the guy in the car.Also[unlike in brickset's picture]the figure has alittle blue jacket Not! an octan jacket.the gas station or should I say gas pump tends to fall over but the rare hase is quite nice.So is the can with the brush.this also comes with one printed piece.This was so nice and the details reminded me of when my dad and I took the to get gassed up.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,5
