I was going to get a repair truck and a blue baseplate, but decided to get this as well. It's not bad, contains a good variety of elements. I recommend buying it to ""boost"" your collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She's greatly enjoyed playing with the set and pieces. She's still largely into Duplo, so I don't mind creating some of the set pieces for her and there is quiet a variety of pieces and alternative builds you do with this set and plenty of ideas from the instructions provided to help guide a child along.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But yeah, those looking for parts and extra pieces, this isn't a bad set for that. I'm highly considering the Cars Set next that's similiar to this one. Not just for my daughter, but for the collection too.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"Fomalhaut","2012-09-05T12:55:41.51Z","I got it for the woman. :)","<p>For some reason the ordinary women are quite rare in todays Lego.&nbsp; So, when I had bought and built a number of houses from the Creator line, I had a hard time finding someone to occupy those houses and making them their homes.</p><p>(It's a shame women are so rare, but I have resigned to assuming Lego has some kind of hidden agenda that I can't figure out...)</p><p>However, when I found this set 5899, discounted to SEK 80 (maybe about $10 or €9), I actually bought two sets.&nbsp; </p><p>Some day I will probably find that the rest of the set – not only the minifigures – is useable somewhere too; at least it seems as a nice&nbsp;mini-version of the Basic boxes of the 1980's.&nbsp; It seems unfortunate though, that the colours are so mixed in this tiny box.&nbsp; Why not concentrate on one or two colours to enhance the building possibilities?</p><p>The building instructions are neat.&nbsp; They cover 1 car, 1 house, 1 cat, and 1 furniture. Imaged on the pages in-between are 2 buildings (1 house and 1 ""shelter""(?)) and 2 vehicles (1 car and 1 mini-tractor). On the box another car is pictured.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4
