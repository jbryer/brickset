There are some red 1x1 round plates to represent the suspension, there are the new 1x3 tiles in lime green at the back and it's got two spot lights in front. Overall it just looks pretty good.</p><p>I made a small change though; I think the lights are way too low, so I swapped the 1x2 plate with door rail with the 1x2 plate with handle (holding the lights).</p><p>My only disappointment really is that the engine is dark grey, not matt or chrome silver.</p><p>All in all a pretty good Tiny Turbo.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truck:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took me 2 minuts to build and 2 minuts to put the stickers on. The truck is high of the ground. I put 2 transparant red bricks in the back for brake lights.</p>
<p><span id="":ku"">&nbsp;As shown here. The stickers weren't that hard to put on.&nbsp;I will do some other costomizing lator when&nbsp;I get some bricks.&nbsp; In this set there are red round bricks (shown in picture) to represent sespension.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are over aged for this set you can buy it to colect more lego racers with out tracks. thats what I'm doing</span></p>
<p><span>That is it for this review. This&nbsp;truck (lime racer) gets a&nbsp;5/5! good to colect if older thai 11 year and +&nbsp;old and good to play with&nbsp;for 11 and&nbsp;-. :)&nbsp;</span></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
