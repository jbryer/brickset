On the plus side, you get a civilian min-fig, someone for your fire fighters to save or your police officers to arrest.  He also has some useful pieces, a computer screen, suitcases, a camera, a satchel, and the small wheels from his luggage cart.<br><br>The luggage cart might be nice if you have a hotel, airport, or train station.  If you are like me and your LEGO town doesn't have those destinations, the parts from the luggage cart and departure sign will most likely be used for other creations.<br><br>I think this guy is worth picking up, but I think you'd have a hard time finding a reason to pick up more than one.  Your town can always use a few chefs, police officers, fire fighters, construction workers, etc.  However, the parts here aren't interesting enough to justify picking up more than one of these guys.  For that reason I'm knocking it down one star.  I hope LEGO gives us more civilian sets like this, but they need to include accessories that are useful for filling your LEGO City.  Things like bicycles, furniture, etc. you can always use more of.  Luggage carts?  Not so much.<br><br>Edit (12/14/2010) - It's been almost a year since I posted this review.&nbsp; Since that time I've actually picked up a few more of this set, so I have to retract what I said above - that I would have a hard time finding a reason to pick up more than one.&nbsp; The reason is that this is a great parts pack.&nbsp; As I predicted above the parts from the cart and sign have been turned to other uses.&nbsp; I used the wheels from the luggage cart to make hospital beds, and the screens are computer monitors (also in the hospital).&nbsp; My overall rating of 4 stands, but I've added a breakdown to show that as a Parts pack this set is worth picking up more than one.<br>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"aplbomr79","2009-12-30T02:18:50.53Z","Makes a good stocking stuffer...","It is an alright set.  I am not understanding the Space logo though (on the Mini-Fig).  This is a great add on to many other sets such as a Train Depot, Airplane/Airport, or as a passenger for the bus in the City Corner set (7641), or even the Camper (7639).

Pros:
1. The Camera is a great addition to this set.
2. This is the first time I seen a satchel (manPurse) used effectively.
3. The dual suitcases are a nice touch.
4. It is less than $5 (USD)

Cons:
1. The Space Emblem on the jacket... not sure where this really fits with the sets of today.
2. The Video Screen is not clear... not sure what it is supposed to be.

"coldcomfort","2011-01-25T02:53:46.907Z","7567 Traveler - Another fun minifigure impulse set.","<p>First of all, I have to point out that my ratings of sets are subjective
 based on what I believe the overall intent of the set to be. For 
example, my expectations of $100 USD+ major sets are much higher and 
more detailed than my expectations for middle price point and 
inexpensive impulse sets. With that in mind, my view towards sets like 
these is that they are marketed to provide Lego enthusiasts with an 
inexpensive avenue of adding 1) minifigures, 2) minifigure accessories, 
and 3) an assortment of basic bricks and elements to their collections. I
 also keep my expectations of the building experience in context. We're 
only buying a minifigure here, after all. We can't honestly expect a 
challenge. I keep only those criteria in mind when reviewing sets like 
this one.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The focus of this impulse set - the minifigure - is a pretty cool one. The torso assembly is borrowed from the space theme, but it actually looks convincing as a leather bomber style jacket. Also, as mentioned in another review, the reddish hair color of this minifig is a lot less common than the brown and black hairs in the same style found in other sets.<br></li><li>The minifigure accessories in this set are nice and there are quite a few of them. With a messenger bag, two suitcases (one black, one brown suggesting that our traveler didn't have the cash to shell out for a matched set and is therefore likely flying coach) and a camera, there is a lot to keep his hands full.<br></li><li>The luggage cart is simple and cool. I like small Lego builds like this one because they require a little inventive and imaginative thinking to come up with - which is also why I enjoy the Advent Calendar sets as much as I do.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I really don't see a con for this set. I will offer a suggestion to Lego as I have on other similar sets: it would be nice if there were two or more slightly different versions of sets like this as I feel most people that buy them do so to fill out their City scenes. I know that I would be very likely to buy more than one of these sets if there were slight differences between them.<br></li></ul>
<p>Once again Lego has delivered what I consider to be an excellent impulse set. The minifigure is great, it has multiple accessories and even includes a few interesting bricks. If you enjoy the City theme, and especially if you have an airport, a train station or a bus depot, you will enjoy this set.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4

You can add the minifig as the tourist that just landed in the airport. The set also comes with a lot of nice minifig accessories. You get 2 suitcases with different color, one shoulder bag, and camera. Really nice. If you happens to not have any airport around, you still can use the set as a tourist. He can take photos on the street, or he can check in a hotel (you can modify the trolley to be more like the trolley that used in hotels).<br>Another thing that I like about this set is the minifig torso. He comes with a Classic Space logo. <br><br>What I don't like about this set is the computer display. It should act as an informational display in the airport (e.g. to inform the plane arrival schedule), but the print feels like when your computer having some error and a warning message appear on the screen.<br><br>But in overall, I really like the idea of this impulse, and the accessories that come with it.

"legospongepotter","2011-03-13T11:04:54.72Z","Get it for Camera","<p>I got this at&nbsp;Toys&nbsp;R Us for 4 dollars. It's not the&nbsp;best&nbsp;set, but you can say it's bad. There's one Minifigure. He comes with messy reddish hair which is new for me, and he's smiling, with his teeth kind of showing. He comes with a red&nbsp;jacket&nbsp;with some pockets and a design that looks like a planet on it. There is a white T-Shirt underneath. He gets a brown bag that goes over his head. His pants are a regular blue.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for&nbsp;getting&nbsp;this set was not for the Minifigure but for one of his accessories. He gets a small black camera, and despite the fact that a lot of people don't&nbsp;like&nbsp;this set, the camera isn't a common pieces. It has a little&nbsp;lens and a hand on the side. There is a power/take picture button and a part on top for the flash. It's very cool and possibly rare. This is a must-have for the camera.&nbsp;Seriously. If you see it at Toys R Us, you have to get it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also a little yellow luggage cart with&nbsp;tiny&nbsp;wheels and a handle to push the cart. There is a brown and a black suitcase inside the cart, and it's nice to get those. You also get this little computer screen on a pole that tells information, but it looks like a website pop-up, not a list of flight schedules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I would really&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this to any Lego fan. You do get lots of accessories that are't entirely common: The suitcases, the bag, the computer screen, the camera. The minifigure is also pretty nice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building Experience - 1 - I actually built the whole set without the instructions, it's pretty easy.</p>
<p>Parts - 5 - CAMERA! GET IT FOR CAMERA!</p>
<p>Playability - 3 - You can't really have much fun by itself, but if you can get the 2010 Airport and put him inside, you can have some fun. Even that 30 dollar plane can have it.</p>

"Torrent_Studios","2021-12-01T01:38:43.923Z","My very first LEGO set!","<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
<br />
7567 Traveller was the very first LEGO set that I remember getting when I was about four years old (time flies), not counting a few other Duplo sets that I had. Because of this, I might be a little biased as to this day, it still holds a very special place in my heart regardless of whether the actual set really was that good.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, the set number, 7567, is coincidentally Captain Rex&#39;s CT number from Star Wars. Small detail I immediately noticed when Rex&#39;s number was mentioned onscreen.<br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong><br />
<br />
The original packaging must&#39;ve gotten lost in the several times my family have moved, but I remember most of the details well enough. The box is in a small square shape, and there is one punch-out flap on the side of the box.<br />
<br />
The box art has the 2010 blue City theme border around the left and bottom edges of the box. The contents of the set are displayed on the front, in front of a nice airport building background.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contents and build</strong><br />
<br />
Inside the box are two small and unnumbered bags of pieces, along&nbsp;with some small fold-out instructions, the kind that you get in polybags nowadays.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are only 21 pieces included in this set, seemingly even less so when observing the set on its own. These pieces form the three main items of the set: The Traveller minifigure, his luggage trolley and a display screen mounted on a &quot;white standard with foot&quot;&nbsp;piece.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigure</strong><br />
<br />
The only minifigure included in this set is the Traveller. He is made up of pieces that were common and generic back in 2010 (even though some of the pieces are much less common, for example the torso with the nice jacket print). This figure is made up of four basic parts as well as two accessories: a nice orange hair piece (the original Ninjago Jay hair piece), a generic City head piece with a grin, a red torso piece with some awesome jacket printing (I really love it, it&#39;s just so cool) and some unprinted blue legs. He has a black camera as well as a&nbsp;brown pouch piece that hangs below a minifigure&#39;s arm,&nbsp;with a great strap that goes right around the torso and hangs on to&nbsp;the opposite shoulder.<br />

<strong>Builds</strong><br />
<br />
The first and&nbsp;more interesting build is the Traveller&#39;s yellow luggage trolley. The bright yellow is fantastic, and the trolley is small yet big enough to perfectly fit two LEGO suitcases. Of course, two are included,&nbsp;one&nbsp;brown and&nbsp;the other black. These fit in the middle of two transparent 1x2 wall elements. The Traveller can push this trolley with a handle piece at the back of the trolley. There are also two wheel axle pieces which serve as wheels, and these actually roll, attached to some 2x2 wheel forks on the underside of the small trolley. I remember being fascinated with this small feature, and would sit my Traveller in the middle of the trolley where the two wall elements should be, and rolling him around on the floor.<br />

The other build is the airport display screen. This has far less pieces than the trolley but the pieces are quite interesting. The most interesting piece&nbsp;is the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4117032"">4117032&nbsp;&quot;Standard with Foot&quot;</a>&nbsp;element. This is a piece with a long white pole which is tipped off with a stud, and the other end is a 2x2 anti stud plate, which can be pinned onto other bricks like other bricks. This element last appeared more than 10 years ago, in 2010 sets, and so it is safe to say that this element has been officially retired. I am quite happy to have this element in my collection - it can serve a lot of purposes, like flagpoles or signposts. The other elements are a 2x2 printed tile with some simple file printing, and a 1x1 brick with a knob. After all these years, I still have all the pieces, which is great.<br />

<strong>Playability</strong><br />
<br />
This set has not much playability on its own since it only has one minifigure and limited accessories, but it can be neatly integrated into your own City airport creations.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall thoughts</strong><br />
<br />
This set might not be the best set ever, but the pieces are quite useful, and the&nbsp;minifigure and the builds are great additions to your airport sets. And because of my history with this set it will always be one of my favourites.<br />
