38cm (l) x 26.5cm (h) x 7cm (w)

605 grams - Total
163 grams - Box Only
Pieces? (Too tired to count them using the instructions)

So this set was the cheapest of the main vehicles of the airport set.
The Helicopter measures 33cm and from one end of the rotor to the other is also 33cm.
The Limo measures 21 cm long.
Took approx an hr with taking pictures in mind to build.

The helicopter is pretty nice as it has spinning rear and top rotors. Again no landing gear inserts.
The blue colour is nice and rich. Inside it looks slightly cramped but I guess it's the size is small so not much detail inside.
Nothing really negative about the heli itself pretty much as I expected. Oh the tail part is a sticker! LEGO make up your mind! Sticker or no sticker for the tails! Geez!

The limo is nice and long, it has 3 minifigs (driver, male and female passenger.
It has what looks to be a DVD screen inside, tinted (black) rear and side windows.
There are split doors for the passengers at the back which is a nice touch.
The bad things about the limo is that the wheels look WAYYY too big for the car, it's like it has been pimped out with wide wheels!
Would have liked to have clear windows for the passengers and the front driver. There is hardly any room inside the back for the two minifigs to do anything. But I guess it's a small car so yea.

I'd give it overall 3.9/5
Not my cuppa but interesing never the less.

"knightsnap","2010-01-29T20:56:14.39Z","Something Original for Lego City","I really looked forward to getting this set this year. The instructions come in two parts, one for the limo and one for the helicopter. 
The build for the limo was fairly easy, and has a nice set of features, including computer for the passengers, ceiling lighting and lights under the carand a new hair piece for the lady (new for my collection at least). The car did flex alot when I went to place the passengers inside.
The build for the helicopter came in two bags, with the base being built first. The new nose and tail pieces are an inprovement over the ones from the Lego planes in the last two years. The rotor assembley is fairly strong, but does occassionally fall of under heavy rotation. 
Overall, the really thought that the set was great, and really appreciated the fact that it was completely different to anything they have released in either City of Town.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"PluffTed","2010-08-01T23:24:13.843Z","Ride and Fly in Luxury","<h4>Pros:</h4>
<p>This is definitely the hands-down best City set I've ever had, well, at least for now.&nbsp; I picked this set up at my local Walmart in San Diego, CA and it's amazing!&nbsp; The price was $29.99 which was a&nbsp;screaming deal&nbsp;for the awesome vehicles you receive with this set.&nbsp; The building experience was short, easy, and fun.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'll start off with the limo.&nbsp; The limo includes removable roofs, opening doors, tinted windows, and wine glasses!&nbsp; I noticed some very peculiar features though.&nbsp; The limo appears to have neon lights on the bottom of the car and also a head lamp above where the man and woman sit with their wine glasses!&nbsp; Some people have complained that the wheels are too big for the limo, well I definitely disagree with this statement because Lego has used these wheels for almost every vehicle they've made and I'm really fine with it.</p>
<p>The helicopter was as good as the limo, if not better.&nbsp; The helicopter includes a suitcase holder, chairs and a table where the man and woman can sit and drink coffee, removable roofs, and spining rotors.&nbsp; I also think that the turning front wheels, engines,&nbsp;and opening storage compartments compliment the chopper very well.&nbsp; I'm not a big ""parts"" guy, but thus set does have some pieces that you don't see often.&nbsp; This set has very great playability where you can ""pretend"" that the man and woman are late to get somewhere.</p>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<p>Even though this set is completely awesome, I have some complaints.&nbsp; The&nbsp;first is that the limo should've included a suitcase holder just like the chopper did.&nbsp; Maybe the limo should've included some sort of stereo or disco ball.&nbsp; Another is that the wheel in the limo and the control panel in the chopper are both way too far out to reach for the driver and pilot.&nbsp; And of always of course, the stickers.&nbsp; Most of the stickers are hard to put on perfectly, but that's just my point of view!&nbsp; Maybe some day, Lego will get it through their thick skulls that nobody likes stickers!&nbsp; Oh well, you'll just have to get it to see!</p>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>If you see this set at your Walmart or any other store,&nbsp;definitely pick it up because it's an exclusive, you get a great money's worth, and you can make your friends jealious!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Skut","2010-02-16T08:45:54.42Z","One of the best helicopter sets ever","<p>Lego has done really well with this set. The reviewers above have done a good job with the pros and cons, but I think the aesthetics of the helicopter in particular need to be emphasised.&nbsp; This is one really swooshable chopper, indeed probably Lego's best looking chopper ever.&nbsp; Styling is a cross between a Sikorsky S76 and Bell 222.&nbsp; A few of these sets would also lead to great MOC opportunities with the new parts&nbsp;- a Chinook or Sea Knight is an obvious MOC candidate.&nbsp; The 6 wide new parts are also the perfect balance between the 4 wide &quot;ancient&quot; Town sets and the honking great 8 wide parts of recent years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I agree that the limo is spoiled by its wheels.&nbsp; It's a great idea but the wheels really let it down.&nbsp; Looks like a stretch limo trying to become a stretch hummer!</p>
<p>The only thing missing from the set is a paparazzo minifig!&nbsp; 5s all round.&nbsp;</p>

"SgtSmash","2010-09-22T13:54:12.747Z","A set for the high roller in town","It's about&nbsp;time&nbsp;Lego finally came out with a set for the limosine ridin', jet flyin', kiss-stealin', wheelin'-dealin',&nbsp;son-of-a-gun in town! WOOOO!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I like this set for a number of reasons. To my knowledge, Lego has never offered&nbsp;a set like this before, with the chopper and limo, which offers a lot of play possibilities. Say you have some of the old NBA Basketball Lego characters. Shaquille O' Neal needs a ride to the Green Grocer, you can't very well pick him up in the town bus! Or, lets say you have a wealthy town villain? He can pull up in his limo to make people miserable. Or, an imporant businessman similar to Tony Stark? The limo driver can be Happy Hogan and they go on a bender and the police pull them over...the list goes on and on. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Anyway, you get the 4 minifigs, the air-taxi copter and the limo. I've only put together the helicopter so far, which was fun. The only complaint I had during the build was that the slanted blue roof bricks where the ""Air Taxi"" stickers are to be attached have what I can best describe as a&nbsp;fine ""sand"" like surface, not the typical smooth surface. This made the&nbsp;sticker application a bit tricky as&nbsp;they&nbsp;didn't want to stay in place. You could probably just eliminate the ""Air Taxi"" stickers altogether,&nbsp;which would make the chopper seem more exclusive to the businessman that comes with the set. But,&nbsp;I digress.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The female minifig is also&nbsp;an exact&nbsp;rehash from several sets&nbsp;that Lego has already introduced,&nbsp;such as the Grand Emporium set, and&nbsp;the Public Transport set.&nbsp;Same hair, head and shirt.&nbsp;The male ""angry""&nbsp;face with the orange-shaded sunglasses&nbsp;seems to be getting recycled quite often as well. It's a shame Lego doesn't dig back into it's archives from time to time&nbsp;if they&nbsp;won't&nbsp;come up with new character faces. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I saved the limo for my daughter to build. It's almost as much fun watching and helping her put these sets together as it is for me. For me, it's relaxing. For her,&nbsp;not only is it fun, but&nbsp;she is learning how to follow an instruction manual, use her hands and gets the reward of accomplishment upon completion.&nbsp;Legos are just plain good. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Anyway, the price is right at $29.99 USD, which is fair compared to say, the Pig Farm &amp; Tractor set which was grossly overpriced at $34.99 USD.&nbsp;Not to always complain about the cost of sets, but with this recent court case maybe not going in Lego's favor, and&nbsp;the market no doubt about to be&nbsp;clogged with cheaper and inferior&nbsp;imitations...perhaps Lego will drop their costs on smaller sets such as these.&nbsp;Nothing will make them...but for those on a budget (who isn't these days?), it'd be nice!&nbsp;",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"clundsberg","2010-08-18T22:58:39.933Z","A fun set...but a bit pretentious for lego land.","<p>I got this for my son and was impressed by the size of the helecopter (compared to my fire, news&nbsp;and police choppers, this thing dwarfs em) the stickers add a nice design, but probably unnecessary.&nbsp; I wish th elimo had the windows up all around and maybe tinted plastic instead of black.&nbsp; Ah yes, I can feel the jealously of the other legolanders and these overly-wealthy socialites go from limo to chopper.&nbsp; Everyone in this set seems&nbsp;ecstatic except for the pilot who has a rather disgruntled look on his face.&nbsp; I miss the days when all lego people were happy no matter what their role.</p>
<p>I digress.</p>

The helicopter features the some what rare jet engines on the top sides, I've only had this in 2 sets before.

Also, the limo, though looks large, Is cramped for space, and its hard to fit more than 2 people sitting down in it. (now I'm getting picky) the turning of the limo&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;good either, when I played with this set I wanted to let the limo go round the corner, but because of how thin and long it is, it takes a good 5&nbsp;meters&nbsp;of space for it to do a full circle without dragging.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, a brilliant set.
