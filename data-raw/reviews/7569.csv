If you read my other review on the other special plane (7643) I like that set better, But this set is ok. It comes with one minifigure, the pilot.<br><h4>THE PILOT</h4><p>The pilot comes with a red base ball cap, he also comes with a cool kind of Jason Stathan kind of look on his face, he come with a red torso with dark blue arms, on the torso their are three logos. His pants are black. OVERALL 4/5</p><p><br></p><h4>THE REPAIR TRUCK</h4><p>The repair truck is kind of cool I guess, It has lots of tools to fix the plane. It is good to go in your airport. Okish design.&nbsp; OVERALL 3/5</p><p><br></p><h4>THE PLANE</h4><p>The plane has a white, blue and red design on it. The propeller can spin 360%, their is an opening copit. It has three wheels underneath. Their are no stickers, but I would of liked stickers because it would if made it more realistic. OVERALL 3/5</p><p><br></p><h4>OVERALL</h4><p>Like I said I prefer the other set (7643) more, but this set was ok, the minifig was cool.</p><p>I would give this set a 10/15.</p><p>(Read my other reviews please, Legoboy12345678)&nbsp; <br></p><br><h1 id=""firstHeading"" class=""firstHeading""><br></h1><p> &nbsp; </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"peppermintmecha","2011-04-03T05:03:09.733Z","A Nice Plane","<p>Not being a frequent flier, this set was always going to be hard to come by for me. However as luck would have it, my attendance at the Memorabilia collector convention led to some rather good LEGO finds. I bought this set at a bargain price and I was very pleased with my purchase.</p>
<p><b>The Set</b></p>
<p>A sport plane and a maintenance truck with a single minifigure make this a basic set, comparable to the City Seaplane from 2010. However this one is much better. Two polybags, some loose parts and a single instruction book keep it compact.</p>
<p><b>The Parts</b></p>
<p>The new cockpit dome in trans-lite-blue makes an appearance and certainly adds to the overall sporty look of the set and a new 2x4 tile is a welcome addition. While the figure sports a new style cap in red, the face and torso prints are common in city so not really a set to buy for the figure.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A selection of parts to build a plane (how unexpected) make for a variety of uses in other builds and the tools are a nice little extra.</p>
<p><b>The Build</b></p>
<p>It was a simple build without any clever little tricks or complex assemblies to attach to a prebuilt section but being a regular Lego City set these weren&rsquo;t to be expected. If you want a challenging plane to build you go and buy a Sopwith Camel or design your own.</p>
<p><b>Final Product</b></p>
<p>This has to be one of the better Lego planes out there, a sporty look with some nice little details combined with a good overall design. It makes a good addition to a city airport, a private airstrip, air show or really any other scene that needs planes. A simple colour swap could make this plane fit into other themes or make a good basis for some sort of combat plane.</p>
<p><b>Overall</b></p>
<p>I wanted this set when details were first revealed and was pleased to find it. The design is good and is certainly one of the best planes Lego has made in a while. If you can track one down at a good price it is well worth it.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"AETerry","2011-05-14T23:16:01.897Z","LEGO Sports Plane Review","<p>I think I'm going to have a hard time giving a proper review as I recieved this set as a gift from my Father who recently went to London and brought this back as a souvenior gift for me; and I don't want to open the box or take the set out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like a fun little set, I'm not partial to airplanes, but this one looks cool from the cover art, the piece count looks good for making the airplane and then the small service car for the plane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a promotional set, I feel rather lucky to have gotten a hold of this. And as it was given as a gift, I can't complain about it's price. I'll be placing the box up in a place of prominence for my LEGO collection.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,3,5
