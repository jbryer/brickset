<p>There are six large blocks which each contain a different moving feature (rattling, popping etc).&nbsp; They're positioned on a board with a background design, so the blocks look like faces or bodys and they can all be swapped into the different positions.&nbsp; On the rear side is a duplo sized baseplate. (P)</p>
<p>My son loved playing with this, especially from around 6 to 18 months.&nbsp; It was one of his favourite toys.(P)</p>
<p>On the negative side&nbsp;the blocks are a bit hard for little hands to get in and out of the slots that they sit in.&nbsp; Also the baseplate is a bit wobbly as the designs on the other side are raised. (P)</p>",TRUE,5,3,2,5,4
