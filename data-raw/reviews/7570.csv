"parchioso","2010-01-03T12:56:52.903Z","Unique and special but not exceptional in overall value","I built this Swamp Speeder tonight, the pricing of this set is quite high for the small size.

The Jedi Commander Barriss Offee minifigure is cool while the other figures are not too special. I just wish I can figure out more on this character.

The Speeder itself has very unique design:
- A side-by-side two seater
- Knob at back that allows you to manuver this speeder like a car (it can turn), there are wheels below but the movement seems to be not very smooth. 
- The bar at the middle looks special but I can't figure out any practical use or playability in it. 
- There are missiles which look nice, but I don't play with missiles anyway
- A propeller that reminds me of my miami trip

I think this set would deserve better rating if the pricing can be lower, due to the unique design and perceived rareness (being a limited edition), I guess it is hot and in demand for that reason, personally I am not too excited on this set, but understand that it should be one that I keep among my Lego collections.

"Julius","2010-01-12T11:22:15.887Z","Barris Offee","This set was just in my local store, so had to get it.

The Luminara Unduli - padawan Barris Offee is a top of the line minifig, and the swamp speeder is hugely improved from the one that came with '7260 Wookiee Catamaran', however hardly enough to justify a full set, which is why this set gets a 4 rather than 5.

Pros:
Barris Offee
The front  wheels and blasters rotation via the jet engine on the back
5 minifigs

Cons:
Pricing
The speeder is rather simple",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"joelmama29","2010-01-26T22:14:10.28Z","SWAMP GOLD! ","Well I am a big time Star Wars Lego Junkie and I love all the sets that Lego has to offer. What I like about the Star Wars line is that Lego make all of the obscure sets like the Wookie Catamaran, Clone Turbo Tank,  and the Swamp Speeder. When I bought the Wookie Catamaran I just loved the Swamp Speeder and the Clone Troopers with the green markings. 

So when Lego was do rerelease of the swamp speeder I was excited to how Lego could approve on this set. As lego did improve the set they also they also did some disapprovments. 

First the improvements this set do stand out for instance the the set is bigger and more sturdy. The set has a solid construction to it so pieces just do not fall off for any reason. Another big approvement is the flick missiles, on the original set the front missiles would constantly fall off. I also like how the front end turns and in conjuction the back engine turns with as well. 

I also love the little details like two printed yes printed control panels for with control handles. And the final improvement is the wheels yes it rolls. 

But here are the cons and there are a few. The first con is the stickers, stickers drive me crazy! One thing about the older sets that make them so nice is the printed pieces thay come with. I understand it is more cost effective for lego to produce stickers for there sets. But it frustrating to put thos stickers on the sets and get them nice and straight. 

Another con is the price. Thirty bucks for this set is just outrageous even with five mini figs. Again some reason Lego is really raising the prices on these smaller sets. Now I hope Lego does not release the Barriss Offee mini fig in another set to make the price on this worth while. 

I just want to conclude by saying this set is great and worth getting especially if you were not able to buy the Wookie Catamaran set. You do get five mini figs the droids and clone trooper are not special since you can get those in other sets. The Barriss Offee mini is great and original and is a must for any Star Wars Lego collector. If you have the money and that does not bother you diffently get this set before they run out and people will inflate the price on Ebay and Amazon. 


PROS:

Great Obscure set from the Episode 3 
Great Sturdy and Design
Great Detail (Two Printed Pieces)
Barriss Offee Jedi Mini Fig 


Cons:

Stickers 
Same old recycled mini figs 
Price

              Minifigs:This set comes with 5 minifigs. It comes with two battle droids, one super battle droid, a clone trooper, and last but not least, beris offee! However, they could of put one more clone trooper in this set and could of made beris's head a little more yellow because it's kind of white. Still, these minifigs would make a great addition to any star wars minifig collection!

              The Speeder:The speeder was the best part of the set to me. The coolest part about this set is if you turn the little fan holder (the thing that the people sit by while riding the ship) the missiles and the front wheels will turn too.The flick fire missiles are kind of hard to flick though because the mechanism I just typed in the review. Though it has cool wheels like the pirate tank and the republic fighter tank except those DON'T have the COOL mechanism that this one does!

"antjtw","2010-01-23T13:51:25.89Z","Very Nice Litte Set","This set is quite special, many do not recognise this, but I can assure you, it is very special, and I shall tell you why!

I will begin with the Speeder itself, it is small in comparison to other sets of 2010. However, as one little green man once said, size matters not! This set is very sturdy, holding together very well, it is at least 3 times stronger than the old one.  

The wheels underneath help the model to glide along surfaces, mainly tabletop-smoothness, but the wheels aid in the amount of playability; It is now easier to play with on carpet surfaces, thanks to the wheels lifting the models and preventing the model getting stuck to carpet fibres.

The design of the model, like most new models is much better than the original. It looks more streamline and more film-accurate. Including the Bar, running down the middle of the model - which also serves the purpose of keeping the model in-tact. It also includes two seats - to seat The Clone Trooper, whom presumer-ably would operate the speeder. and the other can be used to seat either the Jedi inculded, or another clone trooper, possibly from the clone wars series or an episode 3 trooper from 2005, and summer 2010.

Flick fire missiles have never been a strong point in any Lego set, and I'm afraid it is the same in this set - however, the do look good.

Figures: This set has two, standard, battle droids, similar to all production battle droids from 2007 onwards. It also has a standard Super Battle droid, without the missile launcher from the 2008 AAT set. 

It also includes a phase 2 trooper, more commonly known as an ""Episode 3"" Trooper, however, It has a new body and back design on the torso of the mini figure, which looks more film-accurate and gives us something new to look at.

It also comes with a new Mini Figure: The Jedi Commander Barriss Offee. Who appears in the Clone Wars Series. (Television). This figure has a blue sabre-blade with a semi-chromed light sabre. This figure also includes a pale-yellow skin tone, which makes a welcome change to Yellow or the common peach skin tone we're used to in the Lego Star Wars Series.

Overall - I recommend you buy this set.

I hope this review has informed you about this set.

Very detailed includes cockpit and controls.

But my house is mostly hardwood floors so it just slides away when you push or turn it. The wheels are just those smooth plastic one that are even used for a couple of the engines on the Venator.

<br>
Okay! Let's get to the review. What we have here is a Republic Infantry Support Platform... okay, okay, Swamp Speeder. It's a little speeder with laser cannons and a little turbofan that acts like one of those airboats you see in the Everglades - but piloted by a clone. It's a cool concept, right?<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, basically. I personally like this model very much, and it's a joy to build. Being a smaller model, it's not too demanding, but not overly simple either. The steering mechanism for the speeder is inventive and well implemented, and uses quite a few Technic parts. It's easy to use, and the cannons have some very cool-looking barrels. Two of the speeder's contols panels are ACTUAL transfers, and hopefully spell the end for the overuse of stickers in sets.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figures that come with the set are nothing short of impressive, either! Okay, the droids... we've seen them a bit often and they're nothing new. But the new Clone Trooper and Jedi <span style=""font-style: italic"">Barriss Offee</span>? Now <span style=""font-style: italic"">this</span> is more like it!

<p>While the set is pretty good in principle, the is one MASSIVELY defining flaw.</p>

<p>5 Barris Offee is new and exclusive,the Clone Trooper has new printing(better than the LAME clone war ones).A Super battle driod and two typical battle driods(My favorite minifig in this set is Barris Offee)</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Very easy,nothing Challenging</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Kinda small (in fact much smaller than youd think)</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This set may be overpriced and very small,but I wish it had 2 Swamp speeder troopers like in the Wookie Cataram Set instead of common battle droids.If you want my advice buy this only when it is on sale;it should be 14.99 not 29.99</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,2

However, it is sometimes done right, by updating some features or including brand new content. I believe I bought this set in 2011, mostly because I had enjoyed the original version back in 2005. Looking at the 2 side by side, you could almost be tempted to call this a simple color change, and with a brand new Jedi. Despite my hatred towards Lego releasing old sets with a few new pieces and a largely f***ed up price, this is one exception to that rule. The box is nothing special, other than the exclusive logo on the bottom right hand corner. I believe it was split into 2 parts, then again, this was 2 years ago. The Minifigures are quite nice. You can almost never have enough B1 and B2 battle droids. Also the updated episode 3 clone is spot on, and does a much better job than the ones found in the 2014 battle packs... assuming you're reading this after they've been released.&nbsp;I'm not too knowledgeable on the newest clone wars series, but I believe Barris was a padawan who was trapped in a light saber crystal cave back in the original 2003 clone wars version. Lego&nbsp;did a fairly nice job, however, I would have preferred another clone trooper, possibly even a Star Corps clone. The Speeder itself is slightly bigger than the original, and features a moving turret system that is in lined with the speeders movement. Overall, the speeder has been completely updates, even the guns were remodeled. However, there is one concern. The original speeder came with a Wookie catamaran, which was huge, and was only at about 50$. You are looking at 30$ here, and that is just the original retail price. Another clone would have been nice.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great design and update</li><li>Good Minifigures</li><li>Updated movement system</li><li>Fun build</li><li>A great array of parts</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Quite Pricy</li><li>Another clone would have justified the cost</li></ul>
<p>Not a bad set at all, and if you can find one that is under 35$, I suggest you buy it. </p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,2
"LegoHov23","2013-01-03T12:38:25.68Z","Good, Although A Bit Expensive","<p>I like the Clone Wars clones but I <i>adore </i>the Phase 2 clone troopers so I immediately decided that I had to pickup this set when I saw it in stores. Eventually I managed to grab it (the last one left!), and despite the fairly hefty price it was a worthy buy.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Phase 2 clone trooper; I can't get enough of them, especially since I have very few</li><li>Barris Offee; good to have another Jedi and the cape and hood are nice</li><li>Moar droids</li><li>The speeder itself is pleasant to look at</li><li>Nice little seats on the speeder with computers and levers</li><li>To turn the speeder you just twist the engine on the back</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Costly; it's not a big set and Barris Offee isn't worth <i>that </i>much</li><li>Maybe instead of Offee they could've included another clone - could that have lowered the price?</li></ul><div>Overall, a good set but it is costly; seems to be a bit of a trend with Star Wars LEGO. Still, the figures are good (that clone...) and the speeder itself is nice to look at and a good addition to your Republic army. If you can find it cheap, get it. If not.... Think about, because it is a pretty sweet set.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3

"Tar_Domo","2014-10-19T15:57:51.203Z","Army builder set, ""A Bigger Battle Pack""","<p>I bought this just a week ago and paid 37&euro; for it. I wasn&acute;t going to get this as a must-have, but when I found it I decided to take it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This comes in a bigger box than the normal 35&euro; sets. The instructions were easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This contains 176 parts and I feel that a little bit too less when I compare it to its price. But, you get great minifigures so it&acute;s not such a big problem. It has some interesting parts and also stickers.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This comes with 5 minifigures.</p>

<p>Battle droid x2: Nice standard army builders</p>

<p>Super battle droid: Brings some heavy firepower to the battle on the droid side</p>

<p>Clone Trooper: Good Phase II army builder</p>

<p>Barriss Offee: Choose this or the one from Geonosian Cannon. If you like black, pick this and if you like blue more then just pick the other if Barriss is your reason to buy this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I had no problems, I think and the building was overall easy and fast.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Some parts are dropping and the model is a little small when compared to the price but it is a good swamp speeder and bigger than the swamp speeder from Kashyyyk Troopers.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I recommend to pick this if you find it as an interesting set with the price less than 40&euro;. Now Amazon.com sells it with price&nbsp; 37$ and in Ebay it&acute;s avaible in 15&euro;/20$.</p>
