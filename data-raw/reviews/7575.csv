"AndyFawcett","2010-02-12T15:42:23.17Z","Pleasantly surprised by this model","I had a little spare money available, and this model was available at SAH so I decided to get it.

Now, it's not the most technically challenging model to build, quite straightforward really, and there's not a lot in the way of special features.

But the look of it when it is done is just stunning. All I need to do now is decide where I'm going to put it amongst the other models, to show it off :)

The only negative thing about it is the limited availability. As I understand it, it's not likely to be seen on many store shelves. Means a lot of people will miss out on it",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Duq","2010-05-05T05:01:18.623Z","A pretty basic model with lots of stickers","I bought this model mainly for the looks. I like trucks and this racing example looks great with its red and black colour scheme. It also just screams ""Power Functions!"".<br><br>There are 2 books and 8 bags in the box, containing some 600 or so parts. More than a third of the parts are pins which leaves less than 400 'proper' parts for the €55 I paid. That's not great value for money I'm afraid.&nbsp; It's a decent parts selection for building cars; various lengths axles and beams, a few gears, some panels. New parts are the 7L gear rack for steering, the long pin with center hole and some of the panels.<br>The two books are for the main model. Instructions for the alternative model have to be downloaded which I always find disappointing.<br><br>Building it is pretty straightforward. It took me about two hours while 
watching tv. The hardest part was getting the stickers on straight. Especially the ones covering the 5x11 panels are tricky. In total there are 25 stickers on the A4 sheet, covering every panel and some of the beams.<br><br>So how does it look after building? On first glance it's great; an impressive truck. Look closer though and there are some disappointing details. The headlights for example are too small and should sit in the front of the cabin, not on top of the bumper. The mirrors don't look like mirrors at all. The steering wheel is placed vertically which is odd for a truck. Using the mudguard element for the seat is an original use of the part but I would have preferred a few angled beams.<br>The colour coding of Technic elements is not too bad on this model but some of the blue friction pins on the side of the cabin should really be black. <br><br>The truck has limited functionality. It steers and the V8 moves. The cabin doors open and the cab tilts forward to reveal.... err... nothing really. On a normal truck the engine sits underneath the cab so tilting the cab allows access to the engine. The V8 on this truck is placed behind the cab making the tilting funcion a bit pointless.<br><br>This model could really have done with instructions for adding Power Functions. It seems like a perfect size for turning into a remote control car with an XL motor for driving and an M motor for steering. There's enough space behind all those panels.<br><br>Despite a few shortcomings I would recommend this model. For kids it looks the part and it will be fun to race around their room. For AFOLs there's room for improvement and the challenge to motorise it.<br>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,2
"BigMac","2010-10-24T00:44:38.353Z","To me the best part of the set are the stickers.","I don't know why lego issued this set as limited edition. There is nothing surprised at all.<div>Aesthetically, cannot compare with most of the technic truck models. &nbsp;Technically, apart from the an ordinary v8 engine block it is very empty.</div><div><br></div><div>It seems that Lego tries to limited the cost for a set of bigger size. If that is the purpose I prefer a smaller size model with better design and new ideas. Nothing further worth to mention. I give this a 2.5 rating and round to 3.0</div><div><br></div><div>Just very disappointed.</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,2,2
"Plastic_Nurak_80","2010-06-29T12:43:29.72Z","Why Limited? Nothing of special under the stickers","<p>I've bought this set in local Toys Center store for 49 € 90, a bit worried about the fact this set is indicated as ""limited edition"". I wanted this truck for some useful parts there are in the box, but for a while, considering its ""rarity"" I thought I should have preserved this set. Now, I'm wondering why this set has been sold in limited edition.</p><p>Because it has nothing to consider it special or so. Mechanically too simple, surely it has a ""wow effect"" when stickered and exposed. But, I hate stickers and I buy technic not for esthetical purpose.</p><p>B-Model is better. It's a cool looking rear driven sport car, with opening hood. Its scale, if it were a model version of a true sport car, is about 1:12.</p><p>Now I'm not really interested in preserving the model, I'll use pieces for my MOCs, even if this set had a limited production.</p><p><br/></p><p>Vote 5.5/10 (considering B-model too); 4/10 (just main model)</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,3
"Jublivont","2011-01-16T23:25:14.187Z","decent econo set","<p>I bought this set off of E-bay for less than MSRP and was pleasantly surprised by the set.&nbsp; It took my son about 2.5 hours to construct the set and he really enjoyed doing so.&nbsp; On another note, nothing has fallen off after ~20 hours of playtime and that says something for toughness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:&nbsp; Decent Price</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too difficult for younger builders</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaves plenty of room for imagination/add-ons</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:&nbsp; B Model instructions have to be downloaded</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just doesn't have that ""Wow"" factor</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could have included more ""Bang for the buck""</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3
"5_lego_technic_","2011-08-06T20:13:27.123Z","great set! Easy to motorize","<p>This set is a pretty cool set for only $60.00. The set is loaded with stickers and that makes it really cool. Also the set is super easy to motorize. It took me an hour to build it and it was very easy. The motorizing part was very easy and only took about 10 minutes. To motorise it I used an ir remote, ir receiver, lights, a battery box, and 2 m-motors, one m-motor for drive and the other for steering. The truck goes quite fast with an m-motor and has enough torqe to drive on soft carpet and couches. It does preform best on tile floors though. Overall I would buy this set again if mine was stolen and it is a great set!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Phenix","2012-02-20T22:46:19.407Z","8041 Race Car Review (Alternate Model)","<p>Our family picked this set up from the Lego Store winter clearance sale. (I think it was 38.99). &nbsp;My 8-year old daughter is an experienced lego builder, and recently built the VW Bus by herself. &nbsp;This review is based on her experiences, as well as some of my input, being an experienced AFOL.</p><p>(Note: All grades given based on the Race Car model, and not both models, as we have not gotten a chance to build the Race Truck.)</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The packaging featured the Race Truck as the primary model, with the Race Car featured on the back of the box. &nbsp;Out of the two, &nbsp;my daughter was more excited about building the car. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the instructions had to be downloaded to build the alternate model. &nbsp;Instructions are found here:&nbsp;<a href=""http://technic.lego.com/en-us/BuildingInstructions/default.aspx#8041 Group"">http://technic.lego.com/en-us/BuildingInstructions/default.aspx#8041 Group</a></div><div><br></div><div>I'm not sure if it is standard for Technic to advertise a 2 in 1 with only one instruction book, but Lego Creator always come with all builds. &nbsp;We found this to be a negative to the set.</div><div><br></div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>As mentioned in other reviews, there are tons of pins, and of course, stickers. &nbsp;The stickers seem to work well for us, as most covered large panels, that looked a bit boring before placing them on. &nbsp; The large square panels were a great part, and were not around back when I built technic in the 80's. &nbsp;The rounded gears also seem to work better than the old squared gears. &nbsp;Finally, having the odd axles gray and the even axles black made finding parts much easier.</div><div><br></div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>None. &nbsp;Note: &nbsp;I did find the chair to be lame, and prefer the older captain's-style chair with arms and peg holes on both sides.</div><div><br></div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This is where the model shined. &nbsp; The build was exciting, and not repetitive. &nbsp;Even when one side was the same as the other, the instructions spread them out side by side so that it did not seem like you were doing something you just did. &nbsp; The most difficult aspects were ensuring that the longer bars were the correct length when building the frame, and that pins were placed the correct amount of holes over. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By far for my daughter, the most fun was putting together the V8 engine. &nbsp;When she&nbsp;finished&nbsp;that step and was able to turn the wheels to see the pistons, she got even more excited to finish the model.</p>
<h4><br></h4><h4>The completed model</h4><p>This model is very impressive to see and play with. &nbsp; A rear differential gearbox drives the&nbsp;forward&nbsp;V8 engine, and a nob on the back rooftop is perfectly placed to push the car and steer at the same time. &nbsp;The walls are stable, with no ""soft spots"" or areas that risk crushing with a bit of squeezing. &nbsp;There is one spot that needed a mod, though. &nbsp;The gear at the bottom rear that connected to the differential fell off several times. &nbsp;We added a longer axle, with a cap on the end of the gear to hold it in place.</p><p><br></p><p>I would also like to note that there is plenty of room within the body and trunk to add a Power Function motor to it, if you have those parts and are familiar with how to set it up. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This model is a fun build that looks great on a shelf. &nbsp;It also has great playability if your builder is the kind that wants to take it for a drive around the living room. &nbsp;I am not sure if we would have bought it for $59.99, but it seems worth it even at that price. &nbsp;If you buy the set, or have it and have only built the Race Truck, give the Race Car build a spin. &nbsp;You'll be glad you did!</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
