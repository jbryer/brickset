"parchioso","2010-06-19T04:11:15.263Z","Get this for Wampa and the snowspeeder","<p>The highlight of the set needless to say is Wampa, although it is still a little comical, but I would say it is better designed than TaunTaun, the big claw that can hold a minifig is quite interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the coolest thing from the set would still be the snowspeeder, yes, there are already Nth versions of it and this one may not be any much different than the rest, but it is always exciting to see a Snowspeeder coming, the Hoth battle is just too fascinating for many of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The structure is a little disappointing though, it is&nbsp;shallow and does not look good, and it is amusing to see how Lego tries to add a castle skeleton to Star wars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure if the Luke in the set is a new minifig, but the Rebel Pilot should be the same Zev from 8083 I believe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a good set, not perfect but worth buying a set or two.</p>

"arctrooper170","2010-08-02T11:11:38.673Z","Legoman7777's Reviews: 8089 Hoth Wampa Cave","<p>Hello everyone, this is my first review for the summer 2010 Star Wars sets. These reviews will be divided into 4 parts: Box, Build, Minifigures, and Set. Here we go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Box: The box shows the cave with the Snowspeeder flying in behind it to save Luke Skywalker (he is using the force to get his lightsaber from the snow) from the Wampa who is ready to eat him. It is also the first set with the new Dark Blue logo with Captain Rex on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Build: The build starts off by building the minifigures as always but along with bag one is the Wampa and the body of the Snowspeeder. The Wampa is just like the Taun-Taunin terms of building. The Snowspeeder body is almost the same as the&nbsp;old one in set 7666. Bag two is the wings of the Snowspeeder (again like 7666) and the assembly of the Snowspeeder, so far you have a good scene of Minifigures, Wampa and Snowspeeder. Finally in bag three is the cave itself. It is a fun build that again reminds me of the ""wall"" in set 7666.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigures: </p>
<ul>
<li>Luke Skywalker-&nbsp;He is brand new with Hoth gear like the rebels in set 8083. Same helmet as the rebels too, so just think of a rebel trooper from set 8083 with dark gray arms and a blue lightsaber.</li>
<li>Sev Senesca- He is the same as he is in set 8083, with his orange pilot clothes and gray pattern on his helmet. Only difference is he has a trans-orange ""visor"" on his face. He has no weapon.</li>
<li>Skeleton- This is your basic skeleton with exposed ribs and boney arms and legs. He has a classic smiley face.</li>
<li>Wampa Ice Creature- This is the main reason you would buy this set, (if you didnt get it for the Snowspeeder) he is just incredibly detailed with fur marks down his body, teeth impressions, movable detailed horns, and my favorite the left arm can hold pieces like the chicken and lightsabers and the right arm can hold large pieces including minifigures. Great now I can feed my many Ahsoka's to something :).</li></ul>
<p>Set: Lastly we have the set, it is composed of the Snowspeeder and the Wampa's Cave. The Snowspeeder has a dual opening cockpit the can store 2 minifigures and up to 2 lightsabers. The wings can move up and down, and each have a flap that just like in the movie is used for slowing down the speeder as its flying. It also has a working winch in the back to save Luke or trip 8129 AT-AT Walker. The cave doesnt do too much other than look great, but it has a spot for Luke to hang upside down and a flick-lever to have Luke ""use the force"" to get his lightsaber back. The cave also has a nice Taun-Taun&nbsp;remains and fits in with all the other Hoth sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend this set to anybody who wants a Hoth diorama&nbsp;or loves Classic sets.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"Shistavanen_brick","2010-06-27T08:54:58.947Z","""What's the matter, girl - do you smell something?""","I wondered when some kind of set would emerge, that portray the hardships of becoming a living popsicle for the carnivous Wampas. And so in 2010 it came out! How does it match the scene in the movie, then? Well, the box looks very interesting (due to the fact that they have a cool background behind the actual ""cave"") but the set is sort of lacking things.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Obviously, the snowspeeder is nice and makes a great addition to the ships of the rebel fleet. It is really nice to build and looks great. You only need to sturdy the wings as they can fall off. The Wampa is... both good and bad. Good is that it has two different hands. One can actually grasp a minifigure which can illustrate the movie scene greatly. Bad, or more that its appearance looks a bit daft, was slightly disappointing. The minifigures are nice, I think this Hoth-Luke is a new one. I can't recall seeing the torso anywhere else. The pilot with the new painted visir looks stern.</div><div><br></div><div>Onto the cave then. It's not really a cave of sorts... more like thin ""ice walls"" like a hallow scenery of a school-play. The detail that can hold Luke in place is quite good though, and it looks ""real"" enough. But there should be something more. What would be necessary to recreate the scene would be to give Luke his <i>own</i> taun-taun in this set, not just the animal skeleton. You could maybe complete this with the&nbsp;7749 Echo Base I also do wonder why there is a human skeleton there in the wampa cave. Hungry much? Overall, a good set - that doesn't feel complete. It's like buying part 1 of something and then you need part 2 to make it complete.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Snowspeeder!</li><li>Cool minifigures</li><li>Wampa</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>Clearly overpriced</li><li>Stickers</li><li>Needs another taun-taun</li></ul></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3

"Duq","2010-08-09T09:58:41.487Z","Where have I seen that Snowspeeder before?","There are really two sides to this story; there's the Wampa and its cave and there's a Snowspeeder.<br><br>The Snowspeeder looks a lot like the one from 7666 which in turn was strongly based on 4500. The body and the shape of the wings are identical, the only difference is in the engines. Like 7666 the instrument panel, the engine tile and the stripe in front are stickers, not printed parts. The pilot still lies awkwardly in his cockpit and the flaps on the engines still don't close properly like they did on 7130, the very first Snowspeeder back in '99.<br>In other words it's a minor redesign that doesn't improve on its two predecessors.<br><br>The Wampa looks ok but moving hips would have been nice. As it is the legs, body and head are a single piece. just like the Taun taun. Only the arms can move, using Technic axle pins in its shoulders. Its right hand can hold utensils while its left hand can hold a brick.<br>The cave is very simply but effective. The nice collection of white slopes and tiles makes for a convincing ice cave. The real fun is in the details though. There's the opening for the light saber that throws the saber out when you tap it. The Taun taun carcass out of light-clips and cow-horns looks great. Then in the other corner is a skeleton, held in place by its hand holding a pin. And then of course there's poor Luke hanging upside down...<br><br>A slightly disappointing Snowspeeder, pity about the Wampa's hips, but great details on the cave. And of course just because of the Wampa it's a must have to accompany 7749, the Echo base set with the Taun taun.<br>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"legoDad42","2010-08-16T17:35:40.683Z","WONDERFUL HOTH PLAYSET(and a must get if you don't have a Snowspeeder)!","<p>The Hoth Wampa Cave is a wondeful playset and a great addition to Echo Base (7749), Rebel Trooper Battle Pack (8083) and Snowtrooper Battle Pack (8084). Your kid (7 yrs. on up)&nbsp;will have loads of fun and little trouble building the Wampa Cave with Luke dangling above in the rafters awaiting his fate from the Wampa himself...right after he finishes his turkey leg of course...while Zev swooshes around in his nicely designed Snowspeeder desparately looking for Luke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRO's...</p>
<ul>
<li>Well designed Snowspeeder.&nbsp; It's quite similar to previous Snowspeeder models but if you've never gotten one it's a must get set. Nice shape and fairly sturdy. Top view looks great (note: I believe the rear gun is different than previous sets).</li>
<li>Cockpit Opens closes in two parts. Front, longer end opens for pilot, then back section (attached to front canopy)&nbsp;tilts open for rear gunner/navigator.</li>
<li>Rear grappling hook on a wench.</li>
<li>2 front cannons and one rear laser/grappling gun.</li>
<li>Cockpit interior has a sticker panel showing a silohette of an AT-AT.</li>
<li>Left and right rear wing flaps open to reveal electronic/interior engine details (stickered).</li>
<li>Wampa Cave is nicely designed with front large cave opening(simply designed)&nbsp;to fit the Wampa itself. Also to the left of the front we have a small, dark gray rock formation (small BURP)</li>
<li>Interior of cave has stalactites (where you'd attach Luke too, or any unlucky tresspasser).</li>
<li>Taun Taun skeletal remains.</li>
<li>A launcher for Luke's lightsaber mimicing his telekinetic force powers from the movie. Neat feature where you put in the lightsaber (blade first) into a technique 2x1 brick&nbsp;and tilt up, then snap down (quickly but not too hard) and it'll shoot out the saber towards Luke up above (make sure saber is put in ALL the way to the hilt and tilt the mechanism up before snapping down to work properly. Also hold the Cave firmly when doing this).</li></ul>
<p>MINI-FIGs...</p>
<ul>
<li>The Wampa is the star fig. for this set. Nicely designed all around with movable horns (which look like the Taun Taun tusks), movable arms and nice, sharp graphic detail for the fur. Left hand can hold a mini-fig and right hand can hold the turkey leg and the Skeleton figure. Hoth Luke Skywalker is a new mini-fig. New head and new&nbsp;Hoth torso print (front/back) but goggles and hat are the same as the Rebel Troopers from set 8083. Zev Senesca is the same X-Wing pilot w/helmet from set 8083. The Skeleton is the familiar fantasy era skeleton (happy faced).</li></ul>
<p>CON's...</p>
<ul>
<li>Sparse interior cockpit details for Snowspeeder.</li>
<li>Cockpit canopy can come off from time to time when opening/closing.</li>
<li>Stickered details. Wish it was printed tiles.</li>
<li>Wampa Cave details a bit too simple but effective though.</li>
<li>Wampe figure's legs not poseable. Also wished head would tilt/turn.</li>
<li>Snowspeeder needed to be a bit bigger model. Nicely designed but a bit small.<br/>Rear gun of Snowspeeder is only a horn piece. Needed a better design.</li>
<li>Taun Taun should've been added to this set while the Snowspeeder should've been with the Echo Base set.</li>
<li>No hand held blaster weapons.</li></ul>
<p>Overall a really fun playset. I highly recommend this for your kid even though it's about $5-$10 dollars too&nbsp;much, it has 2 unique figures, a cool&nbsp;lightsaber play function&nbsp;and a nice Snowspeeder along with the Cave make it high on playability. </p>
<p>For the AFoL, MOC/MOD on the Cave to expand it more. Redesign the rear gun and MOC the front cannons for a better Snowspeeder look.</p>

<p>I found the set a bit lacking.&nbsp; I will say that the ""boxed set"" feels a little fuller due to the fact that you get to build the snowspeeder and the cave and you get the furry ice monster, but personally, I would have felt better spending less money and just getting the Wampa with a few miscellanous filler pieces.</p>
<p>This is my first Snowspeeder, and I found it lacking.&nbsp; It doesn't have a lot of ""cool"" factor, but you do get a decent cockpit piece and a 2 cannon pieces.&nbsp; They aren't that easy to come by these days.&nbsp; The wings are a bit fragile and minifigs slide around if you try to sit them in the cockpit.&nbsp; That and they have to practically lay down to fit inside.</p>
<p>The cave itself is a stretch of the word ""cave"".&nbsp; A better discription would be ""ice-shack"".&nbsp; It's basically two walls with a roof.&nbsp; Lots of white pieces though.</p>

"Jayr17","2010-08-28T15:27:57.89Z","Some techniques to fix the flaws of Great Set","<p>Great set as the only one currently available with the Snow Speeder! Get this one if you don't have a Snow Speeder, you want a Wampa or look in his Snow gear from Hoth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The build is pretty straight forward, and no real unusually difficult bricks or techniques for 10-12 year olds. A seven year old may need some help with the cannon or the grappling hook.</p>
<h4>Some Things to make it better (quick fixes):</h4>
<ul>
<li>1. Grappling Cannon is only a megaphone and can't hold the grappling hook (the directions just have it dangling). Suggestion: find a black barrel and add it to the back of the megaphone. The Grappling hook will now fit through the open top and can stay there until the Navigator (back seat person) is ready to fire it at the AT-AT to trip them.</li>
<li>2.&nbsp;Pilots computer is on the floor. When you build the Snow Speeder they put two grey flat 2x1 pieces together and the front white piece attaches to these to form the front of the Speeder. UNfortunately they just put the ""computer"" screen brick that gets the sticker of the AT-AT on the floor and now the pilot has it at his feet not in front of him. If you have two extra 2x1 flat pieces from another set just put them under the ""computer"" otherwise just move the two that come with the set under the ""computer"" brick. Now it is level with the rest of the top of the Speeder (where the Windshield comes down), it is where the pilot can see it, and it will actually help hold the pilot in (since you can't&nbsp; lock him onto the yellow bricks if he has a co-pilot/navigator). Note: if you use the ones included in the set, the front is only held on by one connection (not recommended by LEGO).</li></ul>
<p>So overall a great set, to combine with 7749 Echo Base, and maybe some AT-AT walkers (motorized or not). The price is at the top end of its range, but not as bad as the train sets mark up.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;PROs:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wampa, Snow Speeder, New Luke in Hoth gear, Light Saber launcher, lot's of white pieces for Snowy landscape</li></ul>
<h4>CONs:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Missing some easy fixes (written above), Wampa legs and head (don't move), Needs Echo Base to have the Taun-Taun</li></ul>

The Wampa's had the open doorway with icicles hanging down. There was also a small 2x1 section above the doorway for you to clip Luke Skywalker above the doorway, like in the movie. In the corner of the cave, you can slip Luke's lightsaber in this hole, and you press down on the back of the tile and the lightsaber goes flying, as if Luke uses the Force on it.

It's hard to do good photos of 3D Lego models I suppose, so it's not their fault. </p><p>But the pictures I'd seen of this set made it look slightly disappointing - the 'snow cave' in particular just looked like a few bricks thrown together. But it's actually pretty good, quite spiky and icy and quite nicely done.</p><p>The Luke Skywalker in Hoth outdoor gear (rather than snowspeeder pilot gear) is very nice, and the Wampa - with very finely calibrated ability to hold a minifig aloft in his left hand - is great of course. You can imagine they went through a number of sculpture versions before they arrived at this - it's more cartoonish than terrifying, but I think that works well. It's kinda 'fun' without looking stupid. Plus you get the pilot Zev Senesca, and the humorous touch of the Wampa's previous victim in skeleton form.</p><p>The snowspeeder seemed, I think, very different from the last time I built a Lego snowspeeder which, I suppose, must have been set #7130 in 1999, twelve years ago! This one is done well, with room for two minifigs (although their seats are have no grip and nothing to hold them in place, so they slip around and look a bit silly - especially as they have to have their arms raised in the air!) - and grappling hook.</p><p>Overall this is a good playset, and an excellent addition to the other Hoth sets ... lots of scope for quite complex snowy battles and scenarios these days!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

There are some minor changes to the rear, and slight colour changes. The scale is about the same as the previous versions, and all four versions can easily be combined in a display (the differences work well as they're not meant to be completely uniform). The only pity is that only one pilot is included.</p><h4>The Wampa Cave</h4><p>The cave is nicely put together, and looks pretty good for the very limited number of bricks used. The use of slopes and cheesers give it some nice irregular angles, though there's no getting around the 1x2x5 bricks that leave it looking a bit too architectural. Personally I'd like to add a few hundred random white bricks to finish it off and make it a complete cave, but we can't really expect LEGO to do that at a reasonable price point.</p><p>Of course the Wampa itself is what makes this set a must have for any die hard Star Wars fan. It's a beautiful figure with poseable arms and stick on horns. It might have been nice to have the legs poseable too, but that would push the part count up.</p><p>It might have been nice to split this into two sets, since some people might like to have a fleet of speeders, but will only need one wampa in a display (though, I guess there will never be any difficulty disposing of excess wamps on Bricklink).</p><p>In conclusion, this is a really nice set, with two great builds, but it does seem a little expensive for the part count.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,3

"Colonel14","2011-01-21T20:59:32.46Z","What Snowspeeder is this!? The fifth?","<p>Gee, hasn't LEGO gotten tired of making Hoth Snowspeeders? It doesn't matter. The <strong>Hoth Wampa Cave</strong> has been discussed by Star Wars fans for ages, people wondering if LEGO will ever make one. And whaddya know: here's the cave, and here's my review of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Build</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TLC deserves a pat on the back for this. Although a little fragile, the cave is made so well it looks like an ice cave. They even made icicles hanging from the ceiling! There's a spot between the icicles where luke can be placed so he's upside-down. The carcas of a previously devoured animal lies inside the cave, and it's a pretty nice touch. A custom-made launcher is in the cave that holds Luke's lightsaber (to make it look like Luke's using the Force to pull the saber towards him). It doesn't work that well...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Snowspeeder is a nice build, and it doesn't take too much attention from the cave. Some stickers are involved, including a viewscreen with an AT-AT on it. The cockpit sits two minifigures. The build is divided into three parts (the cockpit and the two wings). The wings fit in well with the&nbsp;main body of the&nbsp;vessel. Some cable is on the back of the ship that can roll out to wrap up any AT-ATs terrorizing your living room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Parts</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set has its fair share of parts. There are a lot of white mini-slopes and other white slopes (ranging in size), eight mini teeth pieces, a 2x4 flat piece, two cockpit pieces, two cannon pieces, orange slopes, and a mini mountain piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three minifigures, including a large Wampa bigfig. Luke Skywalker comes with a&nbsp;tan Hoth Rebel hat with goggles, and a torso with front and back printings. His lightsaber is blue with a shiny hilt. The pilot has a head with an orange visor, and he comes with a cool helmet. A skeleton comes with this set, a nice addition to the cave. The Wampa has some assembly required: you have to put horms and arms on him. He's pretty big and looks pretty nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Playability</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You got nearly&nbsp;all you need to reanact the Wampa Cave scene in Episode V: Luke, hanging from the ceiling, a lightsaber launcher, a wampa, and a Snowspeeder. Add a Tauntaun and Han Solo, and maybe Obi-Wan, and you have the perfect scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Overall/Value for Money</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a great classic movie scene that every Star Wars LEGO collector should add to his or her shelf. There is a good minifig selection and some nice parts for MOCing. Buy it when you get the chance!</p>

"Duckuss_Maxximus","2011-01-25T05:13:14.043Z","8089-1 Hoth Wampa Cave - Walking In A Wampa Wonderland","<p>I was really excited when I first saw this set. WAMPA! I'm sorry but the Yeti from Yeti's Hideout (7412) is NOT a substitute for the Wampa! I guess you had to do what you could back then but not anymore. Another great part about this set is the Snowspeeder. It is a slightly updated version from the previous sets (4500, 7130) but for the most part it's the same Snowspeeder. One good addition to this one is that the windshield is now more movie accurate. Not only is the front part adjustable but now the back part which now has a window is too. The engine turbines turn and the flaps on either side flip up to show components and the wings adjust from flight to landing mode. This time around though the tow-cable is held in place by a megaphone piece as apposed to something a bit more sturdy. I had to flip mine around the other way and shove it down inside the funnel part to get it to stay good. Another thing I don't like is decals. Let's face it, decals are never good. At least in my opinion anyway. The rest of the set has some interesting elements but is more like an entrance than a ""cave"" which is a bit upsetting. There isn't even anywhere for the wampa to stand unless you reposition some of the floor tiles. I guess you could expand the cave with additional bricks though. The elements in this set are pretty good though. The icicles, skeleton, and ribcage make it feel like the cave from the movie. Also the lightsaber launcher is pretty sweet (kinda) in that you can ""use the force"" to call Luke's lightsaber to him (or slap him in the face with it, really). The wampa can hold a piece of chicken (or a lightsaber?) and can also hold a minifigure in the other hand to undoubtedly drag prey back to his cave. Luke is outfitted in cold-weather attire, sporting the new Hoth headgear. I feel they should have put some scars on his face from his attack by the wampa. Also I think he should've had a taun-taun. They should make a compartment on taun-tauns to store a minifig. Or at least Han's anyway. You really have to combine Echo Base (7749) with this set (other than 8129) to get the full Hoth effect.</p>

I thought it was fairly good when I first saw it.&nbsp;But I think it is&nbsp;over priced&nbsp;$54.99 Canadian for 297 pieces 3 mini figs and a wampa snow beast.&nbsp;Seems a little much.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I still think the set is great and the wampa is awsome! The light saber launcher works all right but not amazing.&nbsp; The snow speeder is the same as the one that comes with Hoth Echo Base [2007]. But there is more orange on it.&nbsp;I think it looks a bit better then all the gray on the 2007 one. I think the&nbsp;build on the snow speeder was really lame about as lame as the legs on the&nbsp;ATTE [2008].&nbsp;</p>

The cave is ver straightforward yet very detailed;the Taun-Taun Rib bone thing and the skeleton are included and make a more cave feeling;there is a small two stud are where you can hang Luke upside-down and there is the ice thing that you press down on to make it look like Luke is using the force to grab his Lightsaber.&nbsp; The Snowspeeder is&nbsp;a worthy addition to this set;there is room for two pilots but it only comes with Zev.Oh! and there are stickers you have to put on the snowspeeder.</p>

He is in the Rebel Trooper Battle Pack so I was disapointed but the reason&nbsp;I can accept. It's just that he's not rare. And the skeloten is a detail more of than a minifigure. Luke is&nbsp;a cool&nbsp;minifigure. He is new and comes with nice detail and it's just awesome! And the Wampa is a minifigure. He is awesome considering his detail. The minifigures is a 7/10. The snowspeeder is fantastic except for the part the window falls off a lot. It's great detail and it's motor and the harpoon is excelent. The snowspeeder is a 9/10. The next thing or last thing is the cave. The bones is excellent. The lightsaber thing is usefull. It barley flings and will never get to Luke's hand. I like the rock piece and how they made the snow. They should have made it bigger because the Wampa can't fit in the cave. The cave is a 6/10. Overall, this set is a 6/10.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,2
"Nth_Brick","2011-08-19T18:18:44.373Z","Well... it comes with a Wampa!","<p>I have to say, I sorta bought the set on impulse but, I really can't say I regret it.&nbsp; It has some cool features, a snowspeeder, the cave, of course and an upside down Luke.&nbsp; The lightsaber throwing mechanism actually works really well and, if Luke could actually catch it, the lightsaber would fly right into his small, plastic hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wampa has to be one of the highlights of the set and I would nominate for a ""Coolest New LEGO Creature of the Year"" award.&nbsp; Both his arms can be angled up and down.&nbsp; One of his hands is molded to carry the included drumstick while the other is molded to be able to drag along a minifig.&nbsp; And, of course, he does look very much like a Wampa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I believe to be about the 4th incarnation of the the snowspeeder really has some good things going for it.&nbsp; This one has the same old moving flaps and cockpit but, it looks sleeker, weighs less and the cockpit opens all the way.&nbsp; However, despite how great it is, I just can't shake the feeling that it should be a bit bulkier and, that it feels kind of cheaply designed.&nbsp; It can still fit two minifigs and has the tow cable that has been on pretty much every other snowspeeder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wampa's cave looks fairly good on the outside and the designers&nbsp;probably did the best they could while keeping this set within $40 US.&nbsp; It has a bone thing that could conceivably be the spine of recently deceased and highly unfortunate Taun-Taun.&nbsp; Also decorating the interior is a minifig skeleton that seems kinda out of place given that no where in Star Wars canon were other humans eaten by the Wampa that attacked Luke.&nbsp; It is a nice touch, nonetheless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigs included are a bit disappointing given that a) they are not really all that amazing and b) this set really needed more of them.&nbsp; We at least need a Han Solo and a Taun-Taun.&nbsp; Even better would have been for LEGO to include another snowspeeder pilot.&nbsp; I am pretty sure that you need two to pilot a snowspeeder.&nbsp; Other than that, I guess the minifigs are good.&nbsp; It is nice to finally have a Hoth Luke straight from LEGO and another Rebel pilot doesn't hurt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I guess that is all to this set.&nbsp; Despite&nbsp;a few drawbacks (lack of minifigs, kinda cheap snowspeeder) it is well worth the $40 you have to pay for it.&nbsp; Especially when you factor in inflation.&nbsp; So, in the end, I would reccomend that you buy this set before LEGO discontinues them.</p>

So Luke is about to check out an asteriod that hit the ground near him, and before he can get his taun-taun going the Wampa attacks! When Luke comes to he's hanging upside-down in a snow cave with the Wampa nearby eating.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: Though this is a rather small set the designers put in a few cool little features. You are really taken back to the difficult situation Luke finds himself in. The cave has the same design features as the Hoth base sets, quite a few white pieces and randomly placed angled bricks. It gives a nice ""snowy/icy"" effect.</li><li>Pro 2: Luke hangs not by the holes in the bottom of his feet, but by the ones on the back. Clever design so that he stays put easier.&nbsp;There's a neat little lever you tap to make Luke's lightsaber ""fly"" to him as the Wampa approaches. Nice addition.</li><li>Pro 4: You get the feel of a carnivore's cave with bones of different creatures in there.</li><li>Pro 5: The snowspeeder - a good addition for your Hoth collection. It is almost identical in design to the one in set 7666, but has some slight differences.&nbsp;Plus you get Zev Senesca, Rouge 2, who ends up finding our wayward heroes.</li><li>Pro 6: It comes with a Wampa eating a turkey leg! Too cool. And you can pop off his arm, just like in ESB.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: I would have liked to have more bricks for the cave; its a little spare. I think there are more parts to the snowspeeder than the cave and it should be the other way around.</li><li>Con 2: If Lego could have included a tauntaun that Luke could slip inside to keep warm, that would have been pretty cool... though maybe not too popular with the kids. LOL</li></ul>
<p>Though this set isn't a ""must have"" to build a proper Hoth Battle scene, having the snowspeeder helps. But if you're collecting Hoth sets you've gotta get this one. It's a cool set, good playability, a fun build, and great minifigures to add to your collection.

<p>What could be cooler than a Wampa cave eh?!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Easy to follow instructions and the box is well a box but it did have pretty pictures on it - nothing too special in my view.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Despite&nbsp;what you create in this set there wasn&#39;t many &quot;special&quot; parts bar the wampa&nbsp;itself included, although the tall sloped bricks were a great addition to my collection. Also included were a few stickers that were easy to stick on and were as you may have guessed of the normal solid back format (not the clear stickers with only writing or symbols shown you get in alot of newer sets). I did find the Skeleton and parts for making a remains of a&nbsp;ribcage nice little extras too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It won&#39;t surprise anyone that the reason i bought this set was for the Wampa minfig!! And that guy really is the highlight of this set. A solid body with add on arms (with movement) and horns that are also added -&nbsp;these click in easy enough and i was surprised and pleased the horns were not simply sculpted with the rest of the main body.</p>

<p>Luke is a great looking figure aswell. Really nice print on the torso, both the front and back and also comes with the hoth hat that allows the googles&nbsp;to be resting on the hats brim or worn over the eyes. Only one facial expression and quite a happy one - was hoping for either a scared face or better yet a scarred face for after the wampa attacks but it&#39;s a small issue and i&#39;m pretty sure a newer version has been released now anyway.</p>

<p>Finally there&#39;s Zev. Nothing special about that guy really though i liked the designs on his helmet. Feels a little too much like an extra fig that was just thrown in.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I did enjoy building this set although the added snowspeeded meant there wasn&#39;t much to be built on the cave, this is a shame as building the cave itself was the part i enjoyed most. The speeder though went together well and though maybe a little dated now is still a nice vehicle.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>That cave looks great - but it&#39;s way too small!!!!! Could easily be added to but for a set named &quot;Hoth Wampa Cave&quot; i was hoping for a little more. The only features of the cave are the lightsabre&nbsp;flicker, this is a simple design that allows luke to call upon the force to retrieve his lightsabre from the ice, the ice ceiling that allows luke (and other figs) to be hung upside down like in the movie and also the Skeleton and ribcage already mentioned.</p>

<p>The snowspeeder looks good but it&#39;s only features are the opening cockpit and useable Tow cable on the back. Could just be that it shows it&#39;s age as i&#39;m more used to newer vehicles but overall feels a little over simplified. Displays nicely though and is a good size.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this is a fantastic kit for any Star Wars fans and especially fans of Empire strikes back - Like me!!!! Getting a little harder to find at a good price now so worth picking up if you can find it new and sealed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>6/10 overall. It&#39;s saving grace really was the Wampa, personally i would have preferred seeing a Han Solo and Tauntaun&nbsp;figures over the snowspeeder&nbsp;and the cave to be bigger but overall it&#39;s a nice build that displays well. Plus this set can easily be added to or worked into a Star Wars Hoth&nbsp;display.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-12-14T18:53:54.61Z","Fantastic Set, Although Needs to be Combined with 7749","<p>I picked this set up from a garage sale along with 7749 which compliments this set perfectly. I will say that these two sets do seem a little mixed up however as Han and his tauntaun&nbsp;seem more appropriate with this set and the snowspeeder&nbsp;more appropriate with the Echo Base set. Why is there a tauntaun&nbsp;at an Echo Vase bunker? I don&rsquo;t think Han would stand a chance going up against an AT-AT on a tauntaun.&nbsp;Of course if you can get both sets then I guess it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, but otherwise the model selection is a little odd for both of these sets. Now onto this&nbsp;set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First of all, the name is a little misleading, yes it is a wampa cave, but the snowspeeder&nbsp;is a much larger build. So let&rsquo;s analyze the two components separately, because let&rsquo;s face it, they are unrelated.</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>cave</b></p>

<p>the cave is very simple, almost Lego Juniors simple, but still looks very nice with the rib cage and skeleton minifigure&nbsp;great details (not to mention you now have a skeleton minifigure). It is made of mostly larger bricks which is nice since you aren&rsquo;t paying for lots of smaller bricks. It looks very nice. Luke hangs very well by the back of his legs. There is also a nice little feature that shoots out his light saber from the ice using the force (of your finger) although it doesn&rsquo;t fly out, just kind of falls out but is still fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course Luke looks great but I don&rsquo;t think there is anything in the details that screams this is Luke. He could easily be confused for any rebel. But the wampa&nbsp;is what this set is all about. His arms move (and can be removed) but his legs are rigid. He looks great and can hold Luke as well as his chicken leg.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This cave is a lot of fun even if it is simple. I&rsquo;d recommend this set for the cave alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>snowspeeder</b></p>

<p>you probably aren&rsquo;t buying this set for a snowspeeder, but at the same time you won&rsquo;t be disappointed by it. A slightly more complex build but still very simple. Aesthetically however it looks great with a lot of attention to detail. Playability wise it offers you a tow hook, which is really all you need to take down an AT-AT. It looks as if it can seat two minifigures but in reality can only seat one as they need to recline in order to close the cockpit. The cockpit appears to have two hinges, but only the back hinge is functional.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>the set may not have too many unique pieces, but does have a lot of useful pieces if you want to build anything ice related.</p>

<p><b>Playability</b></p>

<p>This is of course what this set is all about. Fighting wampas and flying snowspeeders. The solid construction also makes it great as it won&rsquo;t fall apart while playing with it. I wish the wampas legs could move, but not a big deal, the fact you can cut off his arm is good enough.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I highly recommend this set, especially if you combine it with 7749. Then just add an AT-AT and your Hoth is complete!</p>
