"parchioso","2010-06-20T10:21:27.077Z","Wedge Stickers...!","<p>I am disappointed with this set, I think the designer did not try the best to make this starfighter looks good, I put Ahsoka's starfigher and compare them side by side, I notice that there are fewer stickers, less attention to details, and even no missiles made available to Plo Koon. And the most annoying thing is, the wedge is not printed and is now decorated by stickers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you got Plo Koon already, may be the only thing you really want from the set is the new R7-D4, but as a Starfighter collector, I would get it even I do not rate it good, it is just disappointing to see how Lego manage the product design for this set.</p>

"frostlass","2010-08-02T13:55:35.99Z","Great set!","<p>I got this set at K-mart For the price of $24.99. A little overpriced but it is still good. Now to the details.</p>
<p><b>Minifigs</b>: You get two Minifigs. You get Plo Koon and you also get the rare R7-D4 that you can only find in this set. But you can find Plo Koon in lego set 7676 (Republic Gunship).</p>
<p><b>Structure</b>: Now, the starfighter itself is pretty cool. However, my Plo Koon can fit in the cockpit. You can also eject Plo koon out of the cockpit with the little ball on the bottom. Same back details, nice and chunky like Ahsoka's starfighter, and best of all, it's blue! Nice new gun details, new place to store lightsaber even.</p>
<p>There is one small flaw with this set though. IT HAS STICKERS! No one likes stickers, right?</p>
<p>Overall, I give it a 4.8/5!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4

<p>I picked this set up today at Walmart for $34.86 CDN. Pricey for its size but Lego is expensive in Canada so i'm use to it.</p>

<p>As for the set itself i really like it. It has good detail to it and looks really nice in the blue and white color they made it. Plo Koon is a cool figure to have and that's really why i wanted this set. He can eject out which i thought&nbsp;is a cool feature.</p>

"Jarod98","2010-08-06T19:59:46.103Z","8093-1: Plo Koon's Jedi Starfighter","I just got this set today at Toys ""R"" Us, and I am very pleased with it. For starters, the minifigs in this set are very rare. Plo Koon can only be found in the '7676-1: Republic Attack Gunship', and R7-D4 is exclusive to this set. The ship itself is nice as well, but Lego overdid it with the stickers (just print the designs on the bricks), and it lacks missiles (a real ripoff). Plus, if you want it because it can 'launch' Plo Koon out of the cockpit, forget it, I can barely shoot him out of the cockpit and when I do he rolls off the wings. On the other hand the landing gear is good, and I like the way Plo Koon fits in the cockpit. I'm also glad that Lego gave us a place to put Plo Koon's Lightsaber.I had a great building experience, and the parts were great. It does lack in playability since there are no droids, and the price should be $19.99 instead of $24.99. Overall, I give it a 4.5, which rounds to 5, so it was still well worth it, plus I got a Chrome Stormtrooper free!<br><br>Great set!",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"Carl","2010-12-24T23:52:04.93Z","Pretty Cool","This is a pretty cool set. It includes cool blue pieces and awesome Plo Koon minifig. My brother got the Republic Gunship so it's good I didn't have to borrow his for my 2011 Jedi Display. I got it for free so the value for money is perfect for me. However retail prices are ridiculous, particularly here in New Zealand. The brown (yes BROWN) astromech droid is very cool. The ejector has received some mixed reviews. It does work as long as you push hard enough, and I find it works better if you have the cockpit on while you try to eject Plo.&nbsp;<div>Overall I like this set and would reccomend it as long as you can get it for a good price.</div>",FALSE,4,5,4,5,5

The main feature of the set is a mechanism to eject Plo Koon if he is about to crash or something like that. There is no ejection for his astromech droid though.&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; "">I recommend this set to anybody who missed the first two jedi fighters or like the brightness of this one.</p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; "">Watch my review of this set:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWO6fOQazAc"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWO6fOQazAc</a></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 11px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; "">Here is building the set, stop-motion style:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGD2RbhuhUM"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGD2RbhuhUM</a></p></span>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

You're able to take off the cockpit very easily and you can see the controls which reminds me of the scene from Star Wars Episode IV when Luke Skywalker attacked the Death Star. The wings are flexible and you can also move the landing gears. On the bottom you can see a button which you can push to shoot out the Jedi master. Plo Koon doesn't attach to the pegs but this makes this feature working.

"Mandalorian","2012-12-29T11:16:34.92Z","A beautiful Starfighter at a fairly affordable price.","I have had this set basically since it was released. I loved it then and I love it now. It is big for it's price, things of similar size can be up to double the price these days. The colour scheme is beautiful, it forms a nice pattern on the fighter similar to the one in the Clone Wars. The shape is very sleek and it has fully retractable landing gear that looks great on the ground and is almost unnoticable in flight mode. The cockpit ejection seat works very well at expelling Plo Koon from the ship quite a long way (and the poor Droid stays behind to die). Despite having to go in sideways, the Astromech fits nicely into it's slot. This fighter has superb swooshability, probably better than any other set I own.<br><b>Pros:<br></b><ul><li>Beautiful, sleek starfighter</li><li>Enjoyable building experience</li><li>Nice colours</li><li>Ejection seat works rather well.</li><li>Landing gear is awesome</li><li>Nice minifigures</li><li>Great price.</li></ul><p><b>Cons:</b></p><ul><li>Some stickers.</li></ul><p>If you do not own this set, get it. At an affordable price, you get a ship that's very nice. <br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"StratTone","2011-07-08T14:53:33.317Z","I'm happy.","Never been a big A-wing fan but after building this set I'm leaning towards liking them.&nbsp; My favorite things about this lego set is the ship itself, the build, and the figures.&nbsp; I could take this one apart and build it over and over.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5

"Chills","2012-08-22T22:38:18.163Z","So many Jedi Starfighters, and you fell into my lap.","<p>I was given this set as a gift and while it wasn't on my ""wanted"" list I accepted it graciously. And I'm glad I did, its a pretty cool little set. Its my first Jedi Starfighter, and will likely be my last; but I'm glad to have one in my collection.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The build was fun. I like the use of bright colors in the pieces, especially the blue. I also like the old-school jet engine housings. I remember when those first came out on my passenger plane.</li><li>Pro 2: I'm not an expert in the prequel trilogy, but this set looks pretty close to the starfighter Plo Koon used in ROTS. So kudos to LEGO for an accurate set.</li><li>Pro 3: Good playability for a set this size. Its swooshable, has retractable landing gear, and Plo can be ""blasted"" out of his cockpit; just like the ill-fated Jedi was after Order 66 was given.</li><li>Pro 4: The minifigures are very cool. Plo Koon is only in 2 sets, so its nice to get him in a dedicated set.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The set is a bit pricey for 175 pieces. But that's pretty common with SW license sets.</li><li>Con 2: Stickers... stickers... and more stickers. There are actually some tricky ones in this set: I found the front fuselage stickers tough to put on perfectly. If you want to avoid stickers avoid this set.</li></ul>
<p>Overall I'm quite happy with this set. It rounds my collection with one Jedi Starfighter, and the minifigure looks like he's regular SW and not from the CW cartoon; a definite plus. The ship is full of bright colors and has good playability. The stickers are a con, but if you can get past those I would recommend this set.</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,4,3
"darklighter66","2013-03-25T21:59:06.433Z","Excellent addition to any collection","<p>This is a quick easy set to build.&nbsp; Definitely a must for any fan of Star Wars ships.&nbsp; This is especially a cool set for anyone that is a fan of Plo Koon.&nbsp; The mini figure is cool and looks good.&nbsp; The ship is sleek and looks good with the blue pieces. Having the astromech droid sideways is interesting.&nbsp; The only negative comments I have would be the stickers (not really a fan of putting these on any of my sets) and the clip on the side that holds the lightsaber (Not sure where else it would be put, but it's a little odd having it on the outside)</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4
