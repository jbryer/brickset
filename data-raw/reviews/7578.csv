"desire4one","2010-07-23T11:14:46.797Z","General Grievous is Flying in Style","<p>This set was a lot of fun to put together.&nbsp; It took me about&nbsp;1 hour to put together including the minifigs and table.&nbsp; It seems simple, but has a lot of great features that make the set stand out a bit.&nbsp; And finally, a General Grievous that looks good!</p>
<p>The ship looks par on from the movie.&nbsp; I have to say, thats the first time I've seen that in a lego set.&nbsp; Although not difficult to build, it is time cosuming, as each engine is pretty extensive.&nbsp; It has some great features:&nbsp; Flick-fire Missle bays fold out of the engines.&nbsp; They are perfectly hidden, you can't tell they exist from the outside.&nbsp; The end ""rutter"" folds up and down just like in the films and gives support when the ship is sitting somewhere.&nbsp; And best of all, the cockpit!&nbsp; It actually slides back and forth rather than opening.&nbsp; Finally!&nbsp; </p>
<p>The minifigs are great.&nbsp; General Grievous has&nbsp;a really nicely scultped body, and detail paint is plentiful.&nbsp; You can see his rotting, evil eyes quite easily.&nbsp; When all arms are attatched, it actually looks like he is swinging lightsabers around, in a variety of angles.&nbsp; The whole figure just looks good.&nbsp; And of course, we get a Mon Calamari Jedi.&nbsp; Can't go wrong with that.</p>
<p>Even the little chair/station looks neat.&nbsp; The chair especially.</p>
<p>The only complaints I have are with the cockpit.&nbsp; Theres not a lot of space inside the cockpit.&nbsp; So little in fact, that you can't even get a regular minifigure to sit inside.&nbsp; And if you planning on putting Grievous in there, tear off his extra arms and jam him in there.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Although it was still&nbsp;a little overpriced ($49.99), I didn't feel ripped off or dissapointed.</li>
<li>The ship is a very good replica from the film.&nbsp; I challenge you to find a better one.</li>
<li>Minifigs are pretty cool, with an excellent General Grievous.</li>
<li>Ship features are simple yet neat.&nbsp; I haven't seen the sliding cockpit idea before.</li>
<li>Lots of dark gray pieces.&nbsp; They can be used for anything from stone to dull metal.</li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>The cockpit has a very shallow depth and doesn't allow other minifigs to sit inside, they're heads get squished by the cockpit.</li></ul>
<p>Overall I was very pleased with the set and strongly recommend any Lego fan to get it.&nbsp; General Grievous fans should feel ashamed if you don't make this part of your collection.</p>

"LegoAficionado","2010-08-12T17:55:59.68Z","Can You Believe it- An Amazing set that is just the right Cost!","This is the fourth of five Star Wars Sets that I recently bought. And when buying these sets, this one was one of the sets that I was determined to get.<div><br></div><div>I originally bought the first General Grievous Set back in 2005, and I loved it, except for the fact that Grievous' arms were positioned in an awkward way, so that you could not pose him fighting a jedi. Then Grievous' starfighter set was released only a few years ago, and when I was hoping for an improved General, I was disappointed. Now this set comes along and guess what, I was thrilled to see that Lego remade General Grievous, so let's go on to the review...</div><div><br></div><div>The Minifigs:</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The minifigs that come with the set are AMAZING! First of all, the one minifig you got the set for is of course General Grievous, and this version of him, is a beast. New body mold, new legs (two separate legs to be exact) and four new arm pieces, along with the new chrome lightsabers of the clone wars series. This version is not only mostly movie accurate but is very accurate to the show as well, and the level of detail is evident in he figure itself, no need to say how amazing this guy is.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Then the set also comes with Grievous' medical droid, which only appears in one episode of the Clone Wars series, but he is a welcome addition to any collection. Only problem with this guy is that he is very clunky, and can topple over if not stuck to the neat little medical base. Also, his head is a sticker not a printed head, and that may bother some, but it does not bother me.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Finally, Nadar Vehb (or how ever you spell it) is included, and personally the Mon Calamari head is rare, and a nice collectible, but overall I would have preferred Lego to release a better known jedi in this set, maybe Kit Fisto since he was in the episode this set depicts. Plus maybe a clone trooper would have been nice to, but I am glad that Lego at least put in a jedi into the set.</div><div><br></div><div>The Build:</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>In comparison to the last Grievous starfighter, this one is larger, more detailed, and overall superbly brilliant! The build is moderately challenging and keeps you enticed throughout. I personally had a blast finding out how each piece added to the finished product and when it all comes together, it gives you one of those moments where you really appreciate what Lego does. In other words, a nice Eureka! moment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The ship is very detailed and has some very nice pieces. The aesthetic design also translates into the feature of the ship with some nicely hidden flickfire missile compartments on the side, giving you a total of four missiles. A nice deployable bomb from the bottom of the ship (no gears there but you have to use your fingers, not much though to complain about), and the cockpit function and landing gear are very nicely done. This time, only the cockpit slides open rather than the entire nose of the ship sliding to open (which the last starfighter did).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Grievous fits into the starfighter, but as many reviewers pointed out, you have to remove the two side arms that extend off from the main arms, in order for him to fit in. Personally I have no problem with this since you can attach the two arms to the head of the medical chair that the set comes with, which brings me to talk about the medical station.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>In short, the medical station is okay. The chair is nice and the lightsaber rack is a good place for Grievous' weapons to be stored. All in all, the station is more of a place to put the extra minifigs when you are not using them, and it only adds to the rest of the set.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The set is a much needed improvement in comparison to the old starfighter and Grievous. The ship is excellent, no flaws at all. The figures are fantastic, and Grievous truly shines.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Pros:<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">		</span>-New and Excellent Grievous (w/ 4 lightsabers and a blaster)</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">		</span>-A Jedi and nice medical station</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">		</span>-Superb Starfighter</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">		</span>-Nice features to the Starfighter</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">		</span>-Great Set at a Very Decent Price (this set actually has a good price to it)</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""><br></span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Cons:</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">		</span>-Stickers (but there are only four or so, not a big deal)</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">		</span>-Medical Droid is a bit clunky</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""><br></span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>So Overall, this is if not the best star wars set that I own, and I own quite a few.</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;"">Great Figures, Great Starfighter, And awesome features, for $50, and about 500 pieces, </span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""white-space: pre;"">this set is truly worth buying.

This General Grievous minifig is AMAZING! He looks fantastic! He is very detailed and has four lightsabers just like in the movies. I have no problems with this minifig at all. To avoid two of his lightsabers having to be horizontally positioned, I just put two of those spare clip-like pieces, one on each arm, and attach Grievous' other arms onto them. This allows all lightsabers to face the same way and also allows more dynamic posing. Overall, the new Grievous is one of the best minifigs EVER.</div><div><br></div><h4>Medical Bay - 5/5</h4><div>The medical bay is pretty cool.

The 180 degree guns are a nice addition and the missile on the bottom is cool, however it doesn't fire or fall off so you have to throw it or just leave it on the bottom.

"Aspernatio","2010-08-24T14:42:39.73Z","General Grevious is Back- In Style!","<h4>General Overview<br />
&nbsp;</h4>
<p>This set is based off of the <span style=""font-style: italic"">Star Wars: The Clone Wars </span>episode in which Kit Fisto and his former apprentice, Nahdar Vebb, attempt to infiltrate Grevious' secret base.&nbsp; Lego did a good job in there rendition of the chapter, with obvious attempts to emulate his medical bay, surgeon, and starfighter.&nbsp; It would be right for one to expect Kit Fisto to be included, however the set fairs fine without him.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overall design of the set is quite functional, and easily surpasses expectations. &nbsp; Operating on Grevious is enjoyable, and the sliding cockpit on his ship is both realistic and fun to watch.&nbsp; However, Grevious himself is difficult to position, and very stiff in nature.&nbsp; It can be quite difficult to position his legs, and it would seem the the general is in need of an oiling!</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mini figures</h4>
<ul>
    <li>General Grevious</li>
</ul>
<p>Grevious' Aesthetics are a superb improvement from his former mini figure.&nbsp; The molds used on his head, torso, and limbs are all unique, and the coloring was done perfectly.&nbsp; As mentioned before, his playability is somewhat reduced by his broad stiffness.&nbsp; Furthermore, in order for him to fit into his Starfighter, two of his arms must be removed.&nbsp; While this follows realism, it can become quite cumbersome when trying to make a quick escape!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nahdar Vebb</li>
</ul>
<p>This is perhaps the first time that we have seen a Mon Calamari available in a set priced at $50.&nbsp; I myself am a huge fan of the squid like beings, and was enthralled at the prospect of acquiring one.&nbsp; I cannot say that I was let down, as Nahdar's likeness was created with both precision and good looks.&nbsp; His head piece is painted wonderfully, with the level of detail going down to brown blotches on his forehead.&nbsp; While he is adorned in generic jedi robes, his wonderful head more than makes up for it!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>A4-D Medical Droid</li>
</ul>
<p>A4-D, Grevious' personal surgeon, is an unnecessary yet interesting addition to the set.&nbsp; He has a strong resemblance to the droid featured in the aforementioned episode, and is equipped with several medical instruments.&nbsp; Sawing off and reattaching Limbs to Grevious never gets old, and A4-D's mischievous expression adds all the more realism to the situation.&nbsp; It should be noted that A4-D's head is a decal, but it is hardly noticeable.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Starfighter</h4>
<p>As the main feature of the set, the starfighter aims to please.&nbsp; I believe that it succeeded in doing so.&nbsp; The classy craft features an assortment of death dealing weapons, ranging from front-mounted blasters to concealed flick-to-fire missiles.&nbsp; Additionally, hidden beneath the main fuselage, is a particularly large missile, which looks very capable of wreaking havoc amongst enemy fighters.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
In appearance, the sleek contours of the craft does not disappoint.&nbsp; Sporting a both a simplistic landing gear device and clever cabin opening mechanism, Grevious will have no complaints to the manufacturer. &nbsp; <br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Very aesthetically pleasing<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>A cabin design which slides forward to allow entry</li>
    <li>Landing Gear which facilitates a stable position when idle</li>
    <li>Concealed flick-to-fire missiles</li>
    <li>A single belly-mounted massive missile</li>
    <li>Front Mounted blasters</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>In order to fit into the cockpit Grevious must remove two of his arms.</li>
    <li>Flick-to-Fire Missiles (For those who are not found of them)<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Several Decals (For those who are not found of them)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Medical Bay</h4>
<p>The small little medical bay, while unobtrusive and nondescript, is still a welcome addition to the set.&nbsp; The operating chair fits Grevious perfectly, while his weapons cache is handy for storing light sabers when he's off flying his star fighter.&nbsp; This portion of the set was executed quite nicely, and there is little to complain about.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>A very fitting, swiveling operating chair (360 degree rotation)</li>
    <li>A weapons cache handy for storing off-hand equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Perhaps a bit to small</li>
</ul>
<h4>Equipment</h4>
<ul>
    <li>(3x) Blue Lightsabers</li>
    <li>(2x) Green Lightsabers</li>
    <li>(1x) Blaster Rifle</li>
    <li>A4-D's Operating Accessories</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>While you get quite a lot of variety for your money, I believe that this set was priced a bit too high.&nbsp; However, that seems to be the general standpoint of all sets now, so there's little to complain about.&nbsp; For the same price, you could purchase either the Tie-Defender, or Cad bane's Speeder.&nbsp; After consider all three options, I've concluded that General Grevious Starfighter strikes a good balance between mini figures and parts.&nbsp; In it, you receive the largest amount of parts (454 vs. 304 (Tie Defender) and 318 (Cad Bane's Speeder)) and a moderate amount of mini figures (3 vs. 2 (Tie Defender) and 5 (Cad Bane's Speeder))</p>
<p>I would recommend that anyone considering purchasing this set consider their options, and make a decision based upon their own preferences.&nbsp; Of course, that Mon Calamari Nahdar Webb is pretty tempting...<br />

"sudorum","2012-06-08T18:11:07.893Z","Obvious Contrasts","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>I always considered the original 7656 General Grievous Starfighter to be a rather average set. The Grievous minifigure wasn't too great, but he was General Grievous, so I was content. However, this set not only puts to shame the original Grievous minifigure, but his starfighter as well. The new Grievous is so different from his former self that it's hard to even tell that the two minifigures are supposed to represent the same character from the movies. The starfighter also appears vastly different than the original. It's not as simplistic, and its playability functions are improved. The cockpit still slides effortlessly forward and blasters still raise from the top of the ship. The major improvements are the concealed flick fire missiles which extend from the side of the ship to surprise enemy passerby. Unfortunately, a problem does arise if you try to fit Grievous into his ship with all four arms attached to his frame.&nbsp;<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Except for the new minifigure additions and the random chair and lightsaber rack, this set is essentially an upgraded version of the older model. The 7656 set is supposedly from Episode III and this set here from the clone wars, but it really makes no difference.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-21T05:54:13.76Z","LEGO Star Wars - General Grievous' Starfighter Review","This is a cool set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 454 pieces and it was 50 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 11 cents per piece which is a really good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has 3 minifigs which are new. The Nahdar Vebb minifig looks very nice with his mon calamari head and he also has a double-printed torso and a blue lightsaber. The other new minifig is EV-A4D who is the medical droid. This droid has lot's of tool. The only things which I don't like about this figure are that the face of this droid is a sticker and that the minifig doesn't stand very well. The last figure we get is General Grievous. Grievous looks MUCH BETTER than the version we got in the past.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and it will take you a while. We also get a few sticker to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8095-1.jpg[/img]</span><br><br>This set has a chair with a lightsaber cache for Grievous and the starfighter itself. The chair can sviwel full 360Â° and you can also adjust the back. The starfighter has a storage compartment where you can hide the flick-missiles on each side. On the bottom is a bomb which you can take off. The only problem I have with this play feature that there's no button which you can use to drop the bomb. On the top we get some turrets which you can adjust up and/or down. I also like the engine details on the back of this model and the landing-gear on the back can sviwel as well. What I also like about this starfighter is that the windscreen can be opened very nice and easy, too and I also love the way how you can slide this piece. You can also put Grievous in the inside of the cockpit but you have to take two of his arms off which I don't like. I think this is a much better version of the General Grievous' Starfighter we got a few years ago.

The play-features are well-done, but not obtrusive: the flick-fires fold away and are hidden perfectly and the large bomb nestles nicely underneath. The sliding cockpit works like a charm, and I especially was impressed how the rubber piece was used to keep the cockpit cover in place when closed. The end result is quite accurate to its appearance in Episode III and the Clone Wars. I used to play a lot Battlefront II, and this ship serves as the CIS bomber as well. The ship itself is reminiscent of a 1950s automobile in it general shape, and the side exhaust pipes are similar to that of some hot rods.&nbsp; <br><br>The build is quite interesting with a variety of techniques employed.&nbsp; The two side thrusters, while mirrored, are complex enough to not feel repetitive.&nbsp; <br><br>The ""lair"" is good for what it is--basically a dentist's chair. The chair looks nice and Grievous sits in it well. The storage for his gun and lightsabers is helpful.<br><br>The minifigs in this set are quite well-done.&nbsp; General Grievous is amazing and very detailed.&nbsp; You can adjust his arms enough so that he can hold his lightsabers at different angles as if he is spinning and swing them.&nbsp; Since Grievous does only deploy two-arms often, it is good that that look is an option (the two-arm look is also necessary for him to fit in the cockpit of the starfighter). When not using the two extra arms, I clip them on the side bars on the chair, and fold them behind the chair-back where they are not even noticeable. <br><br>Nahdar Vebb is a pretty standard Jedi, but with a rare and well-sculped Mon Calimari head.&nbsp; A4-D seems to be a pretty unique droud. The legs are standard battle droid legs, but I'm not sure how the torso has been used before--it's more robust than a battle droids.&nbsp; His sticker, while not ideal, works well enough. I've found that he stands quite well if you arrange pose his tool arms in such a way to hold the lights and round tray where he might actually use them.&nbsp; <br><br>Overall, this set is a must-have for any General Grievous fan and is a welcome addition to any lineup of Lego starfighter models. <br><br><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

The mechanism for the sliding cockpit is ingenious and it works really well, as a part of the cockpit clicks into position when closed, preventing it from sliding open. The piece used for the click is also used as a pretty decent representation of the original steering mechanism in the starfighter. For a medium-sized set, this one is very solid and quite heavy. The way that the flick missiles are hidden in the engines is incredibly clever and continues to impress me to this day. Despite the lack of landing gear, this set looks pretty good on display. The minifigures are very nice (Grievous is absolutely amazing!), but I feel there should have been a Kit Fisto included, as he plays a large role in the episode this set is based on.

This is such a great set, it is such&nbsp;a improvment from the previuos version in both figures and fetures and over all design.Before I begin I should tell you this is from the clone wars episode ''The Lair Of Grrievous''.On to the review!</p>
<p>First the minifigs:General Grievous:This&nbsp;has got to be one of the coolest figures of 2010,Grievous&nbsp;has a new body,legs and head as well as a new arm piece that lets you&nbsp;atch&nbsp;anouther arm on to it.This is good and bad because that means he can only hold them side ways, which doesnt look very cool.This can be fixed by put the hand part on to the arm insted,but of course you can come up with your on way.Still,he looks prety impresive.He is armed&nbsp;with his four lightsabers and a blaster.</p>
<p>A4-D4:This is a well decepted figure of Grievous's caretaker and repair droid.He has a lamp on one soulder and some sort of wheel thing,which I cant think what it's for,on the other.On his hands there's a small saw and a grasper that can hold Grievous's arms.Relly a cool figure.</p>
<p>Nahader Vebb:Nahader was Kit Fisto's aprentence before he got shot by Greivous.He has a duble sided cheast and a head thats in one other set.His lightsaber is a new metel crome finsh which looks a little better then the old ones.</p>
<p>The lair/repair center:This&nbsp; is suposed to be the command center inside Grievous castle,fortress thing.Its small and has a rack for his lightsabers and blaster and his chair,which actuly fits him nicly.The only thing is its a bit cramped but thats it and its a welcome adition to this set.</p>
<p>The Ship:Awsome, just pure awsomeness.The front of the ship has the nose cones and front laser cannons,which can tilt up and down.It also has the brown and tan paint job.On the sides of the ship have radiator fins and (wait for it!) hidden missile luanchers! You cant tell it all that there there when they are closed and you dont have to fold them all the way dowen ether.But they are the goofy flick-fire missiles,which work sometimes,but still cool. The cockpit has a nice sliding fature and it locks shut thanks to a rubber piece.The intier has two sticker control panels and Grievous fits in there nicly.Lastly the fin thing on the back of the ship folds up when flying.Also,theirs a missile atatced to the bottom of the ship.I'm not sure what its for but you can flick it of like a bowb and it looks cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last thoughts,a relly cool set that has one of my favorite guys from star wars in it.It works nicly as both clone wars and episode III.But its fifty bucks which is farly high but it is worth it in the long run.Buy it if you have the money,becouse this might be the last set with General Grievous in it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5

"ccjwprongs","2011-12-14T19:29:14.02Z","The Good General's Great Starfighter","<p>I never picked up the original incarnation of General Grievous' Starfighter - set <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7656-1"">7656</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;modelled after the Revenge of the Sith version. I liked the ship, and I liked Grievous, but something about the lacklustre LEGO design of both craft and minifigure of the first set put me off. Imagine my delight when an upgrade as gorgeous as this one came along.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box features the fantastic 2010/11 Clone Wars artwork, doused in blue hues and Captain Rex. I was always fond of it (so I'm less enthused about Darth Maul emblazoning Star Wars merch from 2012 onwards). The set itself is displayed equally well, and showcases the three (all new) minifigures. The instructions are a cinch to follow and shouldn't trouble any capable builders.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Plenty of decent parts to be had here; dozens of 1x2 tiles, a nice helping of dark bley plates and a smashing new canopy. There's also five lightsabers (it is Grievous after all), each with the shiny metallic hilts that have become the norm in recent Star Wars sets. There's a dash of Technic which is a nice inclusion (to both the parts and the build, but more on that later). On the downside, we have the usual sticker sheet...</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>...which even makes its way onto the minifigures. Medical droid EV-A4D's head, comprised of a 1 x 2 x 1 1/3 Curved Top brick, carries the most miniscule of stickers you'll ever come across. It's a pain to get on, and makes you long for the days of printed bricks more than ever. Though the droid itself is fairly useless anyway, with standard parts (apart from maybe the torso) and practically no balance.</p><p>Aside from that niggle, we get Nahdar Vebb, who's a perfect recreation of the Clone Wars character, and also a much cheaper way to get hold of a Mon Calamari head than <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7754-1"">Home One</a>, and a stunningly updated and upgraded General Grievous. I've heard people complain about the Clone Wars TV show far too often for my liking; sure, the dialogue's a bit dubious, and the voice acting even more so, but it's enjoyable enough. But I digress.</p><p>The real reason to like the Clone Wars show is this: the Grievous minifigure accompanying this set. It's a fantastically menacing representation, even if a tad too un-LEGO-y (that's definitely a term) for some. The posture is exquisitely captured through the neck and bent legs that move individually of one another, and the printing is all superb. If I were to have one complaint, it would be the way the second pair of arms attach - while it allows for some cool poses, the arms should technically split into two, rather than the second pair extending at crazy angles from the first.</p><p>That aside, this is a seriously cool lineup of minifigures. At the price range it's also pretty decent for today's sets, though considering one is brickbuilt it wouldn't have hurt to chuck in a Clone Trooper or something.</p>
<h4>The Build</h4><div>Nothing tricky here, and a fairly swift build. Definitely enjoyable though, if a little repetitive when it comes to the mirrored engines. There's some interesting design choices though, and the sliding cockpit is genius. The inevitable flickfire missiles find their way in, but only under a hinged mechanism that cleverly hides them in the engines, for when we don't want to see eight bright orange cones sticking out of our starfighter.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>There's not much I can say about this upgrade, apart from that it's totally badass. And pretty damn meaty too. Stand it next to the original incarnation, and poor old 7656 will likely be found the next day dismantling itself for parts in humiliation. The former attempt was half the price, sure, but also half the awesomeness. Released in the age when LEGO was all about using huge, specialist parts as a half-hearted attempt at 'slopes' (see the second <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7663-1"">Sith Infiltrator</a> for further example), the original didn't have much in the way of 'wow' factor.<br><br>Luckily, 8095 does. Packing serious punch, with some pretty dandy play features and some kickass minifigures, there's not much more you could ask for. Except printed bricks. And even more minifigures. But you can't have everything. Suffice to say it's definitely a highlight of the Star Wars system line-up in recent years, and one of the few sets I'd recommend at full price. Buy it quick before it's discontinued forever. I guarantee you won't regret it.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

<p>The box in this set was a pretty good size. And by that I mean it&#39;s huge, but fits the bags and wide instruction booklet.(And warning, it rolls up easily and is a pain to flatten out. I got this set in a shoebox on my birthday) Anyway, the instructions are pretty easy to follow, though at some points it&#39;s hard to distinguish the many dark-grey pieces from the black pieces. However, it&#39;s still a generally good system to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is a very diverse selection of pieces in the set, including the long front gray piece that slopes down and covers most of the pieces below it, and helps to hold the front of the model together. The windshield piece&nbsp;is a pretty neat piece, and I believe is exclusive to the set. (It wasn&#39;t in the last one) There are plenty of specially molded pieces on the Grievous minifigure, and Admiral Ackabar&#39;s head is used on Nahdar Vebb. Plus, for $50 (original price) you get 454 pieces, so it&#39;s a pretty fair amount of pieces, especially with the minifigures.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, you get the General Grievous and Nahdar Vebb&nbsp;minifigures. Now, there is one problem with Grievous: his head detaches easily. (Must be a malfunction in the cyborg build) Otherwise, he is a great figure, with really cool pieces for the legs and a new specially molded torso.&nbsp;Nahdar is pretty basic pieces, not counting the head. Grievous&#39; droid is another story. A4-D includes a variety of tan and dark grey pieces, and has some equipment for rebuilding the general attached to his backside. He&#39;s a bit hard to keep standing if not on a baseplate, but a great figure all the same. And one more thing: His face is a STICKER. A sticker.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The construction part of the set is a complex (ish) but somewhat easy build. Parts may seem repetitive, like laying the same brown to tan pattern in the first few steps, building the same missiles or the same elevating laser blasters or the same side pieces with the opening missile compartments. Building the cockpit and windshield section itself is cool, with the control panels (which are stickers, sadly) is fun. It&#39;s a good experience.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is an upgrade from the 2007 model, with more complex building to be done, It is also a bit bigger, and include the hidden missile that attaches to the ship&#39;s underside and the flick fire missiles. The windshield to the entrance of the cockpit still slides forward, and the tail fin still elevates in back. However this model includes a chair. A very random chair. A very random reclining chair for the General to be repaired in. The side stand still includes a rack for the lightsaber storage, and a gun this time around. Super-cool model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A fantastic Star Wars set. A very well made set. This set tops the 2007 version, which was very basic in many ways. This set&#39;s playability is very good, with hidden missiles seemingly everywhere, and blasters that rise up and down on top of the ship. The set balances well when the tail fin is down, and provides for a great display.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Grat&nbsp;minifigures</p>

<p>-Great Playability</p>

<p>-Good sized Star Wars set, bigger than last version.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-General Grievous has a screw loose: his head falls off.</p>
