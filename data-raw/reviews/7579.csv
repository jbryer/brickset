"desire4one","2010-07-23T10:47:56.383Z","Palpatine's Shuttle Could Use An Upgrade","<p>This was the first set I put together from the new Star Wars batch.&nbsp; I was excited, since this was one of my favorite looking ships in all the movies.&nbsp; I tore open the bags, spilled the pieces out and 45 minutes later...I wish I hadn't bought it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The set is pretty complicated one to put together, with lots of non-bricks.&nbsp; So much time, space and pieces are put into the ""sick bay"", all for a cheesy mechanic that puts Vader's helmet on him and stands him up.&nbsp; Cool!&nbsp; Seeing it one time.&nbsp; How many times can you recreate that 30 second screen time of Vader's helmet being installed?&nbsp; And thats pretty much the bulk of the shuttles insides.&nbsp; Two small seats will BARELY house minifigs.&nbsp; This isn't a shuttle, its a AMC Gremlin.&nbsp; The overall strength of the assembled ship isn't that good either, with every new placement sure to cause something to fall off.</p>
<p>And it might not be a big deal to most people, but the center wing really bothers me.&nbsp; It shows pegs-out on the left side and pegholes-out on the right.&nbsp; Lego was getting so good at making stuff appear uniform.&nbsp; Any Lego diehard will notice this right away.</p>
<p>For once though, they finally got the landing gear right.&nbsp; Two ski's can fold up and down and it makes for a good looking function, and supports the ship nicely.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably the cheapest set these days to get Palpatine</li>
<li>Clone pilot has a unique face plate, perfectly inbetween Clone Era - Stormtrooper Era</li>
<li>Nice landing gear feature</li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Overpriced for what it is.&nbsp; This set should have sold for $40-$45.</li>
<li>Medical Droid body color doesn't match the color of his limbs.</li>
<li>Plenty of pieces needlessly used to increase piece count.</li>
<li>Unstable.</li>
<li>Not much playability here.&nbsp; Unless Anakin's gonna fight the medical droid...</li>
<li>Center Wing doens't look good.</li></ul>

<p>Minifigs:</p>
<p>The minifigs are great. This is probably the cheapest set ever to get the Palpatine. He is very detailed and has all the right designs.Plus he comes with a lightsaber, not really needed but much apreciated.The clone pilot is an improvement from the last one. The medical droid is also quite cool. The body is one whole piece with the head being part of it. Anakin is this strange tan color. He does not look much different than the old ones besides the color.The body just has part of it burned off and he has this crusty chest that looks very detailed.</p>
<p>Ship intererior:</p>
<p>One things for sure the darth vader transformation thing is so incomplete. All it does is put the vader helmet on the screwed up anakin.If you take it out you will have a lot of extra space.the lightsaber holder is also pretty bad. And it has these two seats which are very secure for the minifigs.After you take out the vader transformation machine there is tons of room.</p>
<p>Top wing cover:The cover to put minifigs in the ship you have to completely take it off. That is really lame.the top wing is very stable and&nbsp; i like that. Though very nice the top part stops it from putting many more minifigs than i would like. You have to place them in a straight line. It has a back gun which i think is pointless but still good.</p>

"bluefocus","2012-01-11T16:27:24.603Z","Excellent......It is","<p>As you can see from the title, this set is quite good. The price range is really good considering I bought it from Amazon because I only had £55 and LEGO sells it for £65 so basically im doing the price rang from Amazon not Lego.com. But if you were to buy this from lego its a total other story for that because I think its over priced by £10, so thats a little bit 'over the top' but you could buy it from Amazon which is a most sensible approach. Also it has 592 pieces so not a bad price on amazon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now on to the set. Im quite impressed by nearly everything. But I have to be realistic so starting with the mini figures. First Emporer Palpatine which really makes this set which you can see from&nbsp; the name. He has got a sith outfit, black trouses and a black hood and cape, also the grey face does look very detailed I have to admit. Next it is the beat-up Darth Vader, AKA Anakin Skywalker. The torso is very detailed again because of the burnts and scars on the face. He does come with his helmet because Emporor Palpatine was transforming him into Darth Vader and we will get on to that later, but the mini figure is very good. Now its onto the clone pilot which again, is good. The head is a clone pilots one with the white helmet.&nbsp;The torso is the clone pilot one, which is too hard to describe. Now the medical droid, again can you please see that because this is turning into a very long review.</p>

"Holton","2011-10-08T23:13:59.52Z","Not a bad addition to the Imperial fleet.","<p>I tend to focus on building the Imperial navy and as this would essentially have been the (newly appointed) Emperor's first personal craft, it was a must-buy.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Nothing major to really comment on here.&nbsp; The box was big for the amount of bricks - but that is fairly common.&nbsp; Box art was attractive but it uses the clone trooper header which I personally dislike.<br></p><p>The instructions were divided into two booklets, which seemed a little strange as the build was not too complicated.&nbsp; That said, they were mostly clear except for the usual trouble discerning between the dark grey and black pieces.&nbsp; There is also a tiny mistake with the lightsaber instructions, but nothing that will confuse.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Nothing to get too excited about here, either.&nbsp; Mostly shades of grey or black - as someone who usually builds Imperial craft, this is to be expected.&nbsp; The cockpit parts are nice and it does include some reddish-brown pieces which I like.&nbsp; There are some Technic parts included for the wing mechanism and the helmet attachment gimmick.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures are pretty awesome.&nbsp; <br></p><p>I am very happy to get this version of Palpatine, as the chances of me ever buying the Death Star (10188) are non-existent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I really liked the burnt Vader figure as well.&nbsp; He makes a good inclusion to the many faces of Vader and he is much more interesting than the figure that came with the earlier Darth Vader Transformation (7251) set.&nbsp; The Vader helmet and lightsaber that he comes with are there for the gimmick, though, and really do not look all that good when attached.</p><p>The Clone Pilot has a great new head design and makes a nice bridge to the Imperial Pilot from the Imperial V-Wing (7915) set.<br></p><p>2-1B, the medical droid, is also quite a good droid using a similar construction to the common battle droids.&nbsp; I had no issues with the limbs being a different color to the torso as this seems more realistic and movie-accurate.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Overall, the build was fairly straight forward.&nbsp; It was separated into four build sections - the cockpit, the main body (with transformation gimmick), wings and landing gear and finally the roof.</p><p>It took me about three hours in total and I only hit one minor snag.&nbsp; I misplaced some of the angled pieces on the roof section but this was probably more my impatience than anything else.&nbsp; As the build is modular it did not take long to spot and fix.</p><p>It was mostly enjoyable but, if you are not a fan of Technic (like myself) some of the mechanisms can be a little annoying.<br></p><h4>The completed model</h4><p>I was very satisfied with the finished product.&nbsp; It looks good sitting on a shelf and is sturdy enough to pick-up and play.&nbsp; I can also appreciate that the transformation gimmick adds to the playability of the set.&nbsp; Let's be honest - that scene was the best in any of the prequel movies even if it only lasted for thirty seconds.</p><p>There are, however, some issues:&nbsp; <br></p>The wings are not mechanically connected so it is impossible to move them at the same time for a take-off or landing.<br>Even though the slanted parts on the roof are firmly connected they tend to rattle a little when the model is moved.&nbsp; <br>In addition, the transformation mechanism has no lock and so the rods at the back of the craft slide in or out whenever the model is held at an angle.<br>Placing the minifigures usefully in the body of the ship is a little troublesome.<br>The cockpit has begun to 'droop' a little just a few weeks after being built.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I really like the final look of the model and, for the most part, I enjoyed the build - engaging without being too complicated.</p><p>I do like my models to be as movie-accurate as Lego allows and, although the model wins on looks (including the holes in the wings - which should be there) the transformation gimmick is obviously inaccurate.&nbsp; I would have preferred the inclusion of the other medical droid and/or the automated stretcher that carries Vader to his transformation chamber.</p><p>Overall, though, it should appeal to most buyers - it looks good for the collector, with some excellent minifigures but it is also quite playable thanks to the (unfortunately inaccurate) transformation gimmick and general sturdiness.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,3

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The shuttle appears briefly at the end of Ep III, and from what I can tell the Lego designer(s) did a pretty good job creating the set to look like the one from the film. I don't remember gold from the film, but I can hardly fault Lego for adding a splash of color to their set. It doesn't detract from the sinister looking nature of the shuttle<br></li><li>Pro 2: The minifigures. You get an Emperor, a clone pilot, an evil-looking 2-1B, and a scarred and burned Anakin. Great additions to a collection. <br></li><li>Pro 3: The build was fun, and it took quite a bit of time due to all the small Technic pieces included. But I'd rather have that than a quick and easy build.</li><li>Pro 4: There is decent playability with this set. The wings fold, there is actual landing gear, the top comes off and there's this cool device that puts Anakin's Vader helmet on and raises his table... just like the movie.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The only negative thing I can think of is 2 stickers that are on the cockpit canopy, it would be nice to have those printed on. <br></li></ul>
<p>This is a really great set, and well designed. Its solid, has a lot of playability, comes with cool minifigures, and is a fun build.

"SanMams91","2015-02-28T04:52:50.667Z","VASTLY underrated set","<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are interesting in this set. Many of them are very small, others are extremely big. A lot of those small slope 1x1 studs are used in this set, but I understand why they are used.&nbsp;I&#39;m the parts&nbsp;can be used for other things.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Honestly, these are the worst part of the set. When I say worst, I don&#39;t mean they are horrible figures, I just mean that they&#39;re, to me, &#39;eh&#39; figures. The one which I actually liked the most is the clone pilot, very cool head printing, otherwise the torso is the same. Emperor Palpatine is clearly a good figure to have, this version is all right if you just want to have an emperor figure. He&#39;s personally not one of my favourite&nbsp;Star Wars characters, so go figure. The medical droid is well moulded, but it isn&#39;t interesting. It also feels like a battle droid and I don&#39;t like them because their parts sometimes break. Worst of all is Anakin&nbsp;Vader, who is just a burnt version of Anakin Skywalker...with a Vader helmet..which did not belong to this scene in anyway...but, moving on.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I gotta say. Out of all the sets of 2010, this one I was not at all wanting&nbsp;to get. Boy oh boy was I gla to buy it!!! This was one of the best builds I had ever experienced. The wings and the ridiculous play feature&nbsp;were a bit of a downer for me, but honestly, this set rocked my world. I loved it. I love having to dismantle it and rebuild it again. It was that good, and it totally surprised me. Excellent build!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model itself was also a surprise. It&#39;s fantastic. I had never owned a shuttle before this one, but my goodness did I ever love this set! You could grab it by its fin, swoosh&nbsp;it around, then land it by closing the wings and lowering the cleverly designed&nbsp;landing gear. I&#39;m not saying the set is without faults; the play feature I have since removed, replacing it with seats for the emperor and anyone else that wanted to join (perhaps a shock trooper). The back of the ship looks a little odd as well. But&nbsp;before this set, I was mostly buying sets because I wanted to own the minifigures, which by themselves were incredibly well designed. This is the set that changed my opinion on what a set should have, should be. This set showed me that builds are actually the better part of spending whatever on amount of money on the set, not just the figures.&nbsp;It also got me interested in the shuttle classes of the Empire and it is with this in mind that I am waiting impatiently for the release of Tydirium. This set is excellent, despite its flaws and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</p>

"Nuruodo","2015-10-31T17:23:28.32Z","Palpatine's shuttle ready for the war","<p>It was 2010 and I noticed that I did need a shuttle or a transport. LAAT was too expensive, Republic shuttle was impossible to find; then I saw this shuttle, that appears just for few scenes in <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>. It seemed smart, fast and luxurious, so I decided to buy it, since it cost &quot;only&quot; 70&euro;. It was surely a good acquire, both for its Lego model and for its role in my hypothetical scenarios.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It includes a lot of light&nbsp;grey parts. There is a rounded transparent&nbsp;piece for the cockpit, some Technic parts for the removable upper part, for the motors and for the wings&#39; junction.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures&nbsp;are a bit rare: Darth Vader with&nbsp;his mask and with the burnt body, that you can obtain only in similar-themed sets; Emperor Palpatine; a clone pilot from late Clone Wars, similar to the ones from ARC-170 (2010) and V-Wing (2014); a medical droid, that was one of the reason I bought the set, because I really wanted a doctor.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was quite long. I enjoyed the build of the main body, in which there are seats, a medical table and locking mechanisms for the removable part. Also the cockpit was nice. The lateral wings were brief to build, while the upper one was a bit longer. However nothing too difficult, but a very enjoyable work.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is lovely. The moving wings and undercarriage&nbsp;are very nice, and you can land like in&nbsp;<em>Revenge of the Sith</em>. Also the fact that you can save Darth Vader just lifting the upper part is very nice and funny. And one of the most awful things is that you can store troopers inside it without forcing them like clothes in a washing machine.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have to say that for its price it&#39;s a really good set. Nowadays a shuttle costs about 90&euro;, but for&nbsp;this jewel I spent 20&euro; less and I&#39;ve to say that I think it should be more playable than a&nbsp;<em>Lambda</em>-class or a&nbsp;<em>Sentinel</em>-class shuttle. It&#39;s most a positive review about it, and I thinks it&nbsp;basically lacks of cons.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Rare minifigures</p>

<p>&ndash; You can operate on Darth Vader just lifting the upper part</p>

<p>&ndash; Wings and undercarriage move like in&nbsp;<em>Revenge of the Sith</em></p>

<p>&ndash; Thanks to its upper wing, it can be easily moved</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; It&#39;s a bit expensive, but less than other similar sets</p>

<p>&ndash; It could be more accurate</p>

"DireStraits85","2017-01-16T22:04:49.19Z","Great Experience.","<p>This set is great for playability and to reenact one of the greatest parts of the Star Wars prequels. It includes a great set of minifigs and a great recreation of Palpatine&#39;s&nbsp;shuttle. It was a fun building experience and would most likely recommend it to middle aged fans of Lego and Star Wars.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-12-14T17:19:17.35Z","Interesting set, but major flaws ","<p>So I just picked up this set at a garage sale, not because I necessarily wanted it, in fact I knew nothing about it, but because for $25 I figured it was an incredible bargain. Quite honestly, it&rsquo;s worth $25 but I probably wouldn&rsquo;t pay a whole lot more for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The parts</strong></p>

<p>The set has a lot of small parts and then a good amount of larger parts, but what it lacks are average sized parts. The small parts are mostly technic, and I felt like half the set was technic. Beyond that there are a lot of angled plates which I like, but nothing else too unique outside of the few parts that give the cockpit it&rsquo;s shape.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;are good, the burned Anakin who becomes Vader is fun to have. You get an Emperor, a very interesting pilot in that his head completes the helmet (helmet has a whole and his white head has helmet decorations), and a medical droid. My medical droid has kind of loose legs so seems a bit wobbly, I kind of doubt he was abused because all the other minifigures I got at the garage sale (about 30 of them) are immaculate, so I feel he may have been designed poorly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>build</b></p>

<p>Like I said, I felt the set was half technic, and since I don&rsquo;t have too much technic I thought it was pretty interesting. It took me about 2.5 hours to completely disassemble and rebuild. There are tons of small parts, but nearly every small part is repeated 20 times so it was always easy to find them. It comes with 2 instruction books, but the majority of the set, including all the complex components, are in the first book. You&rsquo;ll fly through the second book in a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The model</b></p>

<p>The model is nice but has some major flaws, most pertaining to playability. It does look like a nice imperial shuttle, and while it may specifically be the emperors, no reason why it couldn&rsquo;t be used to&nbsp;land on Endor&nbsp;as it has similar look.</p>

<p>The model features very nice retractable landing gear, basically skis. The wings go up and down, however there is nothing in place to stop them from moving when they reach the appropriate height in either direction. They are tight however so they will hold their positions.</p>

<p>the two panels on either side of the top fin are well attached but wiggle due to technic connections that are frictionless and not enough elements around them to hold them in place. Not a huge problem but a little annoying.</p>

<p>There is one major flaw with the design relating to aesthetics&nbsp;and that is the top fin. One side displays the top of the bricks, and the other displays the bottom and looks ugly. I see no reason why Lego couldn&rsquo;t better design this with a SNOT technique to minimize how much of the brick bottoms you see, it might not be possible to make it perfect, but they didn&rsquo;t even try. The other flaws I&rsquo;ll address&nbsp;below in playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Playability</b></p>

<p>This is kind of a mixed bag. The set offers one really cool function. Darth Vader lies down on a bed and it then puts on his helmet and sits him up. This function works very well and is pretty cool. Obviously this is referencing his transformation, but no reason why you couldn&rsquo;t use it to put a helmet on a bathing Vader as well. Of course it is out of place, but I don&rsquo;t mind that since it allows you to avoid having to buy a second set and really just takes place immediately after the shuttle saves him.</p>

<p>However, while this is a cool function, it requires the entire inside of the shuttle, there is no room for anything to be placed in this ship. In fact it is so bad that it elevates the entire floor of the interior so that there is very little headroom in what should be a pretty deep model.&nbsp;Yes there are two tiny cabins that are sunk down to the bottom and are&nbsp;hard to access and offer zero playability so I suppose they can store minifigures, but I prefer to just stick them onto the outside of the ship because of the next flaw.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next flaw is that the is no way of easily accessing the interior. You have to completely remove the top which requires unlatching three technic made clips. What a pain! Even worse, where do you now place the top? To me this is unacceptable, even in the 80&rsquo;s Lego was designing ships with operable doors that gave you access to the entire interior.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is this last flaw that for me ruins the set. What&rsquo;s the use in a really cool play feature if you can&rsquo;t access it. Was it worth the $25 I paid? Yes. But I wouldn&rsquo;t pay any more than that for this ship. Especially since I feel the piece count is very misleading with all the tiny parts (80 connector pegs alone).</p>
