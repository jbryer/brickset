"Melkim","2010-06-24T12:51:08.763Z","So, whatâ€™s new in the 8097 compared to 6209 from 2006?","<p><strong>Overall the new 8097 is a copy of the already existing 6209. New colouring and new mini figures, otherwise only small differences. Mostly new or changed weapon systems. When it comes to building its pretty much the same set, although with some very nice changes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I got the new 8097 version of this death bringing vessel delivered a few weeks ago. The first thing that hits you is the size of the box. It feels huge for a 573 piece model. Nice box overall with nice and inspiring pictures. Even tough I personally don&rsquo;t like the Clone logo of these new series, the box is very nice to watch. Well, not as delightful as the 6210 Jabba&rsquo;s Sail Barge box, with its structured printing, but still very nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Building<br />
</strong>New exiting parts are the half circle at the side of the ship. Two quarter circles form a nice smooth shape and are much fairer to the film original. The tail also has a rounded smooth look. When it comes to details I personally think that the older version beats the new one. For example the new droid arms on the wings give a sloppy impression and the new storage doors to fit small hand guns don&rsquo;t look as integrated as they did in the 6209.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A very nice new feature is the hidden semi automatic missile on top of the ship. You can actually fire away all four missiles by using a &ldquo;handle&rdquo;. This concealed weapon has saved Boba Fett many times and it takes playing to another level. Another improvement is the rear cargo door, which fits Han Solo carbonated. Just open and load him in, then get away before Lando, Leia and Chewie catches up!</p>
<p>&nbsp;To come to a conclusion, the new 8097 is totally worth buying. This model is very fun and challenging to build, with almost no repetitive building. The new nice look and mini figures along with the new play ability makes it a very nice model for both collectors and players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Pros:<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Colouring and smoothness of the model&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Han Solo frozen in Carbonate.</li>
    <li>Mini figure Bossk</li>
    <li>New Boba Fett</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Stickers are always a big no no. Why Lego? Why? Give us Pre printed.</li>
    <li>Missing mini figures: Lando and one of those carbonate-working-pigs.</li>
    <li>Perhaps a bit picky, but Bobas &ldquo;new&rdquo; weapon looks very lame.</li>

"sudorum","2010-07-24T17:12:36.167Z","A Must Have Star Wars Set","If you're a die-hard lego Star Wars fan, you just can't &nbsp;pass up this set. The reason?-the minifigures. The new Boba Fett is a great improvement over the original. He is incredibly movie accurate, and actually has a face under his helmet (whether it's a made-up one or not). Bossk is just as grand and is truly one of the best SW minifigures. The Slave I is a good improvement over the last two versions, although its construction is very similar in some parts to the 2006 version. What separates it from the previous version is the inclusion of accurate minifigures. Anyone remember Dengar? Anyway, you can stash the carbonate-preserved Han Solo in the boarding ramp of the ship, launch flick fire missiles from two compartments located on the side, and also fire a semi-automatic flick fire missile system in the middle of the ship. My only complaints would be the usual expensive price and the carbonate, which doesn't have a covering to conceal Han's back side.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,5,5,4,3
"Buckbrick","2010-07-30T09:30:46.447Z","Everybody loves a Slave 1","<p>No matter how many versions and re-releases, everyone loves a Slave 1. It has got to be one of the best mid-sized SW sets out there. Having owned the previous highly-rated 6209, I had some misgivings of getting another reiteration initially. But it looks cool when placed side by side. I can only imagine all 3 Slave 1's together! Apart from the price, it is a great set.</p>
<p><b>Design:</b>&nbsp; Evolved but fairly similar design: with new parts such as the dark green quarter dome, the front fairing can be rendered more faithfully. I love the new front, but prefer the more streamlined rear of the 6209. However, the new does look closer to the actual ship in terms of how the hull plates appear. Perhaps that's why the 8097 looks a little stunted in length.</p>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Built: </b>Built is about 70% similar to the 6209. The only difference here is the weapons mechanism. But still as fresh and exciting.</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Minifigs:</b> All I can say about the minifigs is WOW. While some would hate the new paint scheme of Boba Fett, it works well when you see the actual minifig. Bossk is awesome with the yellow and fan-fav sand green. You also get a new Han Solo with plain brown legs and an ingenious new carbonite mould, where you can stick Han in.</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Weapons system: </b>I find the new weapons an underwhelming downgrade from the previous Slave 1. The 6209 was simply bristling with enough firepower to take on the likes of the Imperial starfleet, even in Lego form. This time, you get a rack of rockets, a flick-fire missile or 2... I'm afraid that's all you're gonna get this time, Boba. I guess even bounty hunters feel the pinch of the recent economic crisis.</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Stability: </b>Solid, solid as a rock.</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Playability: </b>I'm way pass that stage. But I'm sure the kids-at-heart will get a kick out of swooshing this around.</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Price: </b>Inflation happens even in the SW universe.&nbsp;Ugghh...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>So should you get this set? It can be subjective - just like a Toyota car, it's another face-lifted Slave 1. On the other hand,&nbsp;I know there are folks out there who do not regret owning both Jango's and Boba's Slave 1's. It's the same thing here. I bit the bullet and got this over the iPad. So that's saying something, I guess.</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,3
"J0rgen","2010-06-29T13:13:02.597Z","Put captain Solo in the cargo hold, or just stash him under the entry ramp, either way's good.","<p>I picked this up in&nbsp;the LEGO shop at Billund Airport last Friday, on my way home from LEGOLAND, that means I got the set a little early, since it's due for a July release. I built it while taking a break from the build of my newly aquired Death Star(which I'll probably review at some point) and it was a fairly easy build, compared to the formentioned Death Star. I previously own Jango Fett's Slave I from 2002, and I recognize a lot of elements from that set: The ship's base is excactly the same, only with new colors, but it's supposed to be the same ship, so I guess that's allright. The cockpit is the same, but this one isn't as dark and has <strong>four</strong> horrible stickers. This design is very smooth, compared to Jango's more rough design and the engines on this one really outshines Jango's! The back of this edition looks excactly like the real Slave I! The thing I really miss in the Slave ships is some interior, the old version had some, if the guns were on the outside and you removed the large container you had a narrow corridor leading to the cockpit, which was notably larger than this one, fitting both&nbsp;Boba and his father. In the new version, the only way to enter the ship is by placing Boba directly in the cockpit, the rest of the ship is completely filled up with the weapon systems, the entrance is even blocked! The entrance is definitely the worst part about this ship, at the top it reaches four bricks tall, that means the doorway's only three bricks tall, not nearly enough room for a minifigure(especially the new Boba Fett, with his jetpack and ""antenna"", he's&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the tallest minifigures I've got). It's not only the doorway that's too low, the ramp leading up to it is way too steep. And then there's the problem that it's blocked by the weapon system. The reason the ramp is so elevated is that instead of actually having a cargo hold inside the ship to put captain Solo in, the designers decided they'd just make room under the ramp and put the carbon-freezed Solo in there instead. So, that was the main negative thing about this set! Now, to the weapon systems, even though they take up an awful lot of space, they're the most advanced, firing missiles I've seen in a LEGO set ever! I'm obviously not talking about the blue flick-fire missiles located in the ships front, but the orange rack of re-loading missiles located in the ships center. You fire them by pressing one of the engines, located on the rear side of the ship, after you've opened a hatch in the ship's front. The beauty of this mecanism is that once you've fired a missile, it instantly prepares another for launch, which it will repeat until you've fired all four missiles. A slight improvent over the missiles from Jango's Slave I! There's also the laser cannons, they don't fire anything but imaginary lasers of course, but they rotate very smoothly. Despite the lack of proper interior, the ship has quite a lot of storage space, in addition to the compartment where Han Solo is put, there's a safe built into each side of the ship and in the front, behind the lasers, there's an compartment containing an empty crate. Finally, before talking about the amazing minifigures, I must&nbsp;mention the color scheme. Even though the balance between gray and dark green is good, the dark red for the base does not fit, the last version of Boba's Slave I had a brown base, which looked way better! Then it's time for the minifigures, Boba Fett is AWESOME! Plain and simply, his utility belt is now printed on the torso, there's a trophy from a defeated wookie and his armor look's better than before. His jetpack is detachable, as well as his helmet and the helmet has the detachable target system, previously used for the ""Clone Wars"" clones. He also has his worn out cape over his left shoulder, the only thing I didn't like at first was the sand blue arms and legs, but when seeing the minifigure in real life I thought it looked good. I have prepared grey arms and legs though, so I'll see wether I'll replace them or not. Bosssk has a cool, new head and has a movie accurate spacesuit. Han Solo has one of this new heads(with an&nbsp;white dot&nbsp;in his eyes), but I guess that's the future of Star Wars LEGO, luckily I have plenty of real Solo heads to replace it with, so I'll do fine. His shirt is nice, but could use some ironing. The carbon freezed Han Solo is great, especially compared to the old printed version. Han Solo fits in the back, which is a pretty nice feature.</p>

"hobohopper","2010-08-14T01:54:40.233Z","Great set for fans of Boba Fett, but like everyone has already said, it is extremely overpriced.","I have to say, this is probably one of the most well designed sets of the year. The only thing that should be holding anyone back from buying this set is the price.<div><br></div><div>Let's start with the minifigures.</div><div><br></div><div>Boba Fett: HOLY COW. This has to be one of the greatest minifigures of all time. The helmet, the detail, the jet pack, the everything is wonderfully accurate. Some may say this is more aciton figure than lego minifig, but i disagree. Sure the blaster and the silencer look a bit awkward, but if that bothers you just take it off. Looking at the pics, it seems as if the jet pack and the cape separates his shoulder from his neck far too much, but rest assured, once you have this figure in hand, you will notice that the helmet sits much closer to the shoulders than the pictures depict. Boba Fett looks flawless</div><div><br></div><div>Bossk: This guy's pretty cool too. Brand new head is accurate, and hard plastic, unlike Yoda or Plo Koon. This means you dont have to worry about paint chipping! He makes for a fun foe for Boba Fett to fight against.</div><div><br></div><div>Han Solo: new face, new torso, but not much else to say. He looks a bit better than previous incarnations, especially the face. He fits into the carbonite piece via pegs that his hands can grab.</div><div><br></div><div>Carbonite: Not techincally a minifigure, but this thing's wonderfully detailed. All the printing is...well printing. No stickers here =] great texture and a detailed molding of Captain Solo trapped in there. This is worlds better than the previous incnarnation.</div><div><br></div><div>The Ship:</div><div><br></div><div>At first glance, it looks alot like 6209. But fret not. It shares the shape, but the design is more different than you think. The rapid fire flick missles are much different from the single spring missle in 6209. They fire well too, and as a bonus, the structure of the mechanism serves as braces that hold the entire ship together. The mechanism is pure technic, which, combined with the bricks that make up the ship, creates one of the sturdiest, most solid starwars sets ive seen in a long time. You can knock someone out with this ship! (but please, don't).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cockpit rotates with the wings, which are gravity powered. It gets the job done alrite.</div><div>The interior of the cockpit, however, is a huge mess up. There is literally nothing in here beside a brick that the Fett man sits on, and a 2x1 flat printed control panel. Theres so much space in here, i dont know why lego couldnt have designed a less spartan cockpit. I've modded mine extensively, as im sure most of you will too.</div><div><br></div><div>Along the sides of the ship are various compartments. There are useless flick fires that u can fold out. Atleast it looks cool, if not much else. The compartments are small, Fett's gun will not fit in here. But, the cockpit is so enormous and empty, Fett can jsut hold on to his gun.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You can stow away captain Solo in the cargo hold with ease. He stays in plays, not much rattles during play. However, the cargo hold is inaccurate. The previous slave 1's got it right, this one does not simply because the new carbonite mold wouldnt fit into the ship. So, the cargo hold is actually in the ship's bottom skirt, the dark red part (sorry, i cant think of a better way to describe it). You cant recreate that famous ""put captain solo in the cargo hold"" scene =[</div><div><br></div><div>The entire ship is probably the most move accurate slave 1 to date. The ship is aboslutely gorgeous, a great display model. The colors look beautiful. The dark red, when contrasted against the green, look almost brown. I feel that the stickers need not be applied. The ship looks accurate without them, so those of you who are complaining, just dont apply them.</div><div><br></div><div>Once again, this ship has very few flaws. The only gripe, is the price. Everyone's been saying it, but the ship is not worth $80. In my opinion, $60 is a fair price. $70 is pushing it, but not completely unreasonable. $80 just feels like Lego is trying to cash in on Boba Fett's popularity, knowing that no matter how expensive the set is, the Boba fans out there will still buy it. Shame on you Lego. This is a perfect set, at an unreasonable price.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3

It was nice to re-issue some old sets with in my opinion, better minifigs. But the price, is way to much for some of the sets. In Singapore, this set's retail price is $199.90! Crazy amount of money for way too few pieces. But, I guess that is the trend of the Star Wars sets in general. So is the ship worth it and are the minifigs worth it?<div><br></div><div>We have not build the old Slave I so the building experience are based on a first timer. It is pretty fun to build and there are obvious improvement to the look of the ship when compare to the old one. But for the price, it could have had more details or parts to make it more complete. Somehow, it seemed a bit unfinished, like in the cock pit area and the wings. The ramp door at the back is a bit fragile with the pieces came off pretty easily. We can't really describe it but we felt a bit anti-climatic towards the end of the building like, ""That's it? This for $199.90!?""</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, the new colours are nice and the ship's design is cool! And, the minifigs that come with the set are gorgeous. The drool factor is high for the minifigs here...

The fact is that it is one of the more iconic ships in Star Wars adds to the value of the set and make it a must-have for us. The ship is nicely designed and the new colours are good. What pushes this set that may justify the hefty price are the minifigs.

<p>The ship itself is quite big, and probably the closest to scale.&nbsp; You could really envision Fett flying this thing around the Kessel Run.&nbsp; It has good stability and a weighty feel.&nbsp; The blaster cannons look good and the hidden missles in the tail give it that ""Fett"" feel.&nbsp; The semi-automatic missle system is a bit shaky.&nbsp; Shoot it too fast and it's gonna fall apart.&nbsp; A one of a kind cockkpit window.&nbsp; Sadly, it's so big it will likely not see use outside of the instruction manual.&nbsp; Lots of storage sections for hiding and smuggling goods.&nbsp; I could see this becoming a mobile base of operations for young bounty hunters the world over.&nbsp; That being said, all the interior space is used up on the missle firing system.&nbsp; Just once, I'd like to see Lego design a set with the INTERIOR of a model in mind.&nbsp; Then again, these are designed for little guys (and gals).&nbsp; </p>
<p>The minifigs are the shining point in this set.&nbsp; Boba Fett may be the best looking minifigure I've seen thus far.&nbsp; He is extremely detailed and accurate to the films.&nbsp; Lego knows this and that's why they're price gauging the set.&nbsp; Bossk is great too, with a head piece far superior to those produced these days.&nbsp; Throw in a Han fig and Carbonite piece and your good to replay Empire.&nbsp; ""He's no good to me dead""!</p>
<p>Lego also threw in an accessory sprue, which is nice to see.&nbsp; Visor, Kama, Antena, and&nbsp;2, count em, 2 Blaster&nbsp;Pistols.&nbsp; They should embrace this idea and add it to more sets in the future.</p>
<p>Pros</p>

<li>Ship is solid and big.&nbsp; A great centerpiece that can take a beating.</li>
<li>Boba Fett and Bossk.&nbsp; Terrific figs and in my opionion the best ones thus far.</li>

<li>The interior of the ship is wasted on the missle system.&nbsp; Sure it can shoot missles, but nobody's hitching a ride on this one.</li></ul>
<p>I must restate that this set is extremely overpriced.&nbsp; If you're pulling your wallet out for this one, like it or not, you're paying for the minifigs and the allure that is Boba Fett.&nbsp; If you're thinking of buying this for your little Lego fan at home, look else where, where you can get much better bang for your buck.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,2

<DIV class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph""><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText>Welcome to my review of the newest edition to the Slave I family. I hope this will be helpful to those contemplating the purchase. I'll start with the set's strenghts, and then move on to its weaknesses.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph BVRRReviewTextFirstParagraph""><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV class=BVRRReviewTextParagraph><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText>As anyone familiar with the Star Wars Slave I will immediately notice, this version most clearly reflects the movie version of the Slave, at least as far as colors and shape go. The dark green pieces are the biggest improvement in this area over the 2006 version. In addition, the Boba Fett figure is truly a beauty. The other figures are nice additions: Bossk has a solid plastic head, (which I prefer to the rubbery heads some aliens have nowadays), and Solo's carbonite block is very nicely molded (be aware that it has no back, however! Solo just sorta hangs in there, and is clearly visible if you turn the block over). The set is not difficult to build, has some useful parts to build your Lego collection, and has a fantastic rapid-fire missile mechanism. It's honestly a very neat little set.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV class=BVRRReviewTextParagraph><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText>However, this set has many weak points that, in my opinion, solidly undermine its strengths. The most glaring issue: it's vastly over-priced. For a comparison:</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV class=BVRRReviewTextParagraph><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV class=BVRRReviewTextParagraph><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText>- 2010: 8097 Slave I - 573 pieces, $79.99 (US), 3 minifigs<br/>- 2006: 6209 Slave I - 537 pieces, $49.99 (US), 4 minifigs<br/>That's nearly double the price for only 36 more pieces (which are primarily small technic parts), and one less minifigure</SPAN><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText>.</SPAN></DIV><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText>
<DIV class=BVRRReviewTextParagraph><br/>Another issue I have is with the multitude of STICKERS. The quality of Lego stickers has increased in the past few years, but these guys are just plain difficult to put on straight, and I'm in graduate school. I can't imagine 9-15 year olds having an easy time. Moreover, the stickers tend to peel off after years of use. For a $30 increase, one would hope Lego could provide the printed parts as it did in the earlier versions (i.e. 7153 Jango Fett's Slave I).</DIV>
<DIV class=BVRRReviewTextParagraph><br/>Finally, some of the smaller squables I have with this set: the missile firing mechanism, while nifty, protrudes into the cabin area (simply an aesthetic issue). Also, Boba Fett must hold on to his gun, because this ship has no storage compartment that will fit it! (Older models had plenty of storage). In addition, this version's cabin seating is the most scant of any versions - just a block with a control panel (compare, again, to the seating from Jango's slave I). And lastly, Han Solo gets stored under the ramp in the back, not up in the ship as the older versions had.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV class=BVRRReviewTextParagraph><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText>So, in summary:<br/>Pros:<br/>- Most movie-accurate colors so far<br/>- Fantastic Boba Fett minifigure, neat Bossk figure and Solo in carbonite<br/>- Missile firing mechanism is cool<br/>- relatively straightforward and fun build</SPAN></DIV>

And at $79.99 it is pretty costly. But what you get with it is not only in my opinion the best version of the iconic Slave I, but also the best versions of the iconic Boba Fett, Bossk, Han Solo, and Han Solo in Carbonite.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>My first Slave I was the original 1998 version, which in comparison to this version is very small. Then I got the 2002 Jango Fett Slave I version. When the Boba Fett Salve I was rereleased in 2006, I decided to pass up on it, and I regretted that I did until I bought this set. Let's see what has changed for the better and worse, and how does this set stand with its other counterparts?</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigs:</b></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>L</span>ego has been doing really great this summer with releasing new and improved versions of previously old lego minifigs.

I am so glad&nbsp;Lego decided to separate the jetpack from the helmet in this&nbsp;version,&nbsp;because it truly makes the minifig realistic in comparison to the movies.&nbsp;Also the shoulder cape is a very nice touch along with the color scheme.&nbsp;All of Boba Fett's armor is a sea foam green while his arms and legs are a tan blue color. In general very aesthetic.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Bossk: This bounty hunter is very rare, and all together fits perfectly with this&nbsp;set.</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre""></span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Han Solo: This Han Solo is very detailed and the carbonite container is perfect,&nbsp;because Han just clicks right into the bottom of the container.

Well in comparison to the first two versions of the Slave I, it is very different. In comparison to the 2006 version, not so much. The main difference this Slave I has amongst every other version is the main function of the ship and the more slick and movie accurate detailed look to it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The build is more challenging that most of the other sets, but that is because the ship is very big. It is a good foot in width and length, and a good 5 inches in depth. The build takes place over the course of 3 bags and 2 instruction booklets, but this only makes the build more organized than just having a bunch of pieces dumped around.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The main function of the set is a flickfire missile contraption housed in the center of the ship, just below the cockpit. This is the exact same place that the 2006 version had the large trigger missile located. In my opinion, the flickfire mechanic works very well and I do enjoy this feature. On the sides of the ship are two more flickfire missiles and those unfortunately are a little harder to work properly, but they still work.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The ship has numerous storage compartments, two on each side of the ship as well as the main cargo hold for Han Solo to be stored. The Carbonite container fits perfectly into the cargo hold and overall, the storage units are very nice. My only gripe with these storage containers is that there really isn't anything to put into them. Sure you could just stuff some pieces there, but there are no extra blasters to store. Anyway...</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The look of the Slave I, as I have said before, is the best. Everything looks smoother and slick. All the pieces work together and the color scheme fits exactly to what the movie version Slave I looks like. Compared to the 2006 model, this Slave I has dark red and green pieces rather than mostly Light green and brown pieces. The red and green also give the Slave I more of that rusting aged looked to it as well, which makes sense.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The only problem with the ship that I found was the the seating for Boba Fett is very minimal and could have been elaborated like the 2002 model of the Slave I.

"David1971","2011-01-08T16:59:23.45Z","I'm afraid I was rather disappointed...","<p>Everyone seems to love this set. But for the price, I'm sorry, I don't find it to be that amazing. It's a good sturdy ship, well designed, and a good match for the iconic ship seen (briefly) in the movies. The Boba Fett minifig is, again, iconic, and very nicely done. And you get two other minifigs, a normal Han Solo and the unusual Bossk. So the three minifigs are good.</p>
<p>The ship is pleasingly solid, and has&nbsp;quite a good number of&nbsp;little doors and hatches which are very&nbsp;nice. There's room to put Han-in-carbonite in the back, and it's clever how the wing things rotate depending whether it's vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>But much of the interior is taken up with an overcomplicated, not very exciting mechanism for launching the tiresome flick-fire missiles ... I think it would have been nicer to have had a proper spaceship interior with seats and computer panels. After all, there's not even room for poor old Bossk to sit down.</p>
<p>In 2009, there were two sets around this price point, set #7754, Home One Mon Calimari Star Cruiser, and set #8038, The Battle of Endor. They both came with lots of minifigs and loads of playability. There was so much you could do with each of those sets once you'd built them. Whereas here ... it's a sort-of impressive object, especially for Star Wars fans, but it doesn't offer that much fun.</p>
<p>If you want a very well-made Lego model of Slave I, and a Boba Fett minifig, then this will make you very happy. It couldn't be better, if that's what you want.</p>
<p>If, like me, you like Star Wars and you love Lego, and you like a good fun set, and swooshable spaceships, and you like to get a number of interesting minifigs when you're spending Â£80 - and you like them to at least have somewhere to sit down (!!) -&nbsp;then this isn't necessarily the best set ever.</p>

<h4>Parts</h4><p>Not bad, I suppose. You get some pretty cool ones, like the dark green quarter circles and the dark red shell pieces. This is also the first set to have the trans-clear windscreen.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Although there aren't as many as I'd want in an $80 set (I would've really loved a Bespin guard, or maybe even a new Dengar), the ones it has are really good. The new Boba Fett is a major improvement, but printed arms and legs would've really made it awesome. Bossk is a great figure too, but not as iconic of a character. Han's new face is way better than the original (never liked his old face at all), and his torso is pretty good. The new Han in carbonite piece is far better than the old 2x1x5 brick from the older sets.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Pretty good, and not too repetitive.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Very cool looking. The size is decent, and the colors are good. I don't care for flick-fire mechanisms, but at least this one doesn't compromise the ship's aesthetics. The only real complaint I have is the overly simplified cockpit, but it can easily be fixed.</p>

<p>This is my first Slave 1 and the largest set piece-wise I have ever owned (I have a castle with 435 pieces that I have had since childhood). Let me say, I am not disappointed at all.&nbsp;Ok, enough with the personal gushing, onto the set itself.</p>
<p>The ship looks very movie accurate. I love the color scheme much better than pictures of previous releases. It is also&nbsp;rock solid&nbsp;which is nice. I think it could possibly be used as a hammer. The rotating wings and pilot seat are a nice touch as well. I like the pull out flick-fire missiles and especially the semi-autmatic missile system--it is loads of fun! The ship has nice little storage areas for extra weapons. I consider the one in the ""chin"" of the ship to be Boba Fett's trash can. Han in carbonite stores nicely in the back too. I think it was smart to have the little wedges that allow&nbsp;the carbonite&nbsp;to slide in easily, but require some effort to pull&nbsp;it out. The one thing that would have been nice to have is some extra space for a prisoner or ally--but ultimately, it's not a big deal.</p>
<p>The build was a lot of fun and nice and long with very little repetition. I didn't have any flimsiness issues or pieces falling off during the build like others mentioned. I have not had any experience building anything like the missile firing system, so that was especially cool to see come together. Like everyone else, I don't really like stickers, but the Mandalorian skull is pretty cool. There seemed to be a good diversity of pieces--including many you don't see very often.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;mini-figs in this set really&nbsp;shine. Boba Fett is amazing--way better than past versions. Han is pretty standard for a Han, but the carbonite piece is top notch. My favorite, though, is Bossk.&nbsp;His&nbsp;regular figure was a favorite as a kid, so that may have something&nbsp;to do with it.&nbsp;He's a great rival for Boba. I team him up with an IG-88 droid from another set.</p>
<p>Anyway, I highly recommend this set! I also recommend, but not&nbsp;quite as highly, playing the&nbsp;""My Backpack's Got Jets"" song on loop while building.</p>

	Han Solo and Carbonite&nbsp;</h4>
<p>
	This revision&nbsp;of Han Solo and the carbonite is&nbsp;pretty cool. Along with the new shirt, he also has a new face which looks much better than that of the old one. &nbsp;The carbonite now, instead of being flat, has&nbsp;raised&nbsp;features. &nbsp;Han can fit into the&nbsp;carbonite, but, unfortunately, the back is exposed. &nbsp;The two would probably get an 8/10.</p>
<h4>
	The Bounty Hunters&nbsp;</h4>
<p>
	The new Bounty Hunters are superb. The new Bossk mini-figure is well done, and exclusive to this set. Bosskâ€™s head is made of hard plastic, which is nice because the rubber kind loses the paint details much faster. Boba Fett is pure awesomeness. The color scheme and body parts are much better than the older version. The only problem is that his antenna keeps falling off. Both Bossk and Boba would get a 9/10.</p>
<h4>
	The Slave I</h4>
<p>
	The Slave I is pretty good, but there are some problems. The dark brown on 6209 looks better than the reddish brown. Instead of a detailed cockpit, Lego used a simple 2x3 plate and a control panel! Why didnâ€™t they make it like the cockpit in 7153? Just in behind the cockpit is a flick-fire missile rack. It works, but the torpedo launcher 6209 works a heck of a lot better. Also, the plates on the bottom keep falling off. On top of that, the model is $20.00 overpriced based on the piece count! However, the ship isnâ€™t all bad. The instructions are easy to understand and the model is fun to build. It also has a lot of unique pieces and great playability. Although there are some problems, it deserves a 7/10.</p>

<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set comes with a lot of unique parts and I think that factors in to the price being so high.&nbsp; For one thing there is a very large cockpit piece that I cannot imagine that Lego has used for much, if anything, else.&nbsp; Of course, the best piece is the carbonite Han Solo which, judging from pictures, is a vast improvement over previous sets.&nbsp; It is larger and molded as opposed to printed.</p><p>One complaint though, there are a fair number of stickers and they are not of good quality.&nbsp; I have had this model for only a couple of months and already they have to be pushed back down on some of the pieces.&nbsp; This is much worse than the other models I have.<br></p><h4>Minifigures</h4><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Han Solo:</p><p>This is a new version of Han, however with the white shirt and brown pants it is very similar to the figure included in Jabba's Sail Barge (6210).&nbsp; The main difference is that there is more detail on the shirt.&nbsp; He has the same expression as all the other Han Solo minifigures.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Boba Fett:</p><p>This is a brand new Boba and it is amazing.&nbsp; His helmet is printed with loads of detail and though there is a bit of a space between it and his shoulders, that space allows his head to rotate with the helmet on, so it's alright.&nbsp; His torso has front printing and the jetpack accessory is quite detailed.&nbsp; He also has a partial cape and a gun.&nbsp; The gun does look a bit silly with the grey piece on the end, but that is an easy fix.&nbsp; Either remove it, replace it with an extra piece in black, or just use a gun from another set.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bossk:</p><p>Bossk is great.&nbsp; Right now this figure is exclusive, but I have a feeling Lego will make at least one other set with him.&nbsp; His head is really nicely sculpted and painted and his torso has front and back printing.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is pretty decent for a set with this many pieces.&nbsp; There are some more complicated aspects involving the missile firing system, but nothing a builder with a decent amount of experience couldn't handle.&nbsp; Some of the stickers are really hard to place though and some of them have to be aligned perfectly (the ones on the front of the ship) or else they won't match and it will look bad.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This model is quite large, I was impressed with the size, and the colours are quite accurate to the movie.&nbsp; Playability in this set is really good.&nbsp; When you pick up the ship and hold it vertically, the wings automatically adjust, just like in the movie.&nbsp; The firing mechanism takes up a lot of space, but it works really well.&nbsp; I actually really like the way it was designed.&nbsp; There are some other flick-fire missiles, but even though I don't care for flick fire as a rule, they are movie accurate and I do appreciate it that they were included.&nbsp; It is true that there is nowhere for Bossk to sit, but he is a rival of Boba's so there is no reason he would be in his ship anyway.</p><p>What I don't like about this model is the lack of storage space.&nbsp; There are very few compartments and there is not room to store the extra armour bits you get.&nbsp; I was very disappointed with this aspect of the model.&nbsp; There could also be a little more room in the back so Han in carbonite was secured better, he keeps sliding forward and it really annoys me even though he doesn't actually fall out.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>It's a nice ship, but this set is very expensive.&nbsp; You get 573 pieces for $110 CDN, which is I think one of the worst prices for a Star Wars set I have seen here.&nbsp; Maybe if you are a huge Boba Fett fan you would be willing to pay full price for this set, but I am not.&nbsp; My advice is to wait for a sale if you want this ship.&nbsp; I paid about $80 CDN for this because there was a deal at TRU that if you buy any two Star Wars sets you get 25% off your order.&nbsp; Without that deal I would never have bought this.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3

My nephew, however, is a massive Lego fan and so we picked him up Darth Vader's tie Fighter (8017) for X-mas.

That said, as my first ""real"" set in over 15 years, this one kept my interest, showed of the ingenuity of the Lego designers, and challenged me for somewhere around 5 or 6 hours of build time.

"dragon_teenager","2012-02-10T11:46:27.877Z","One of my favorite OT sets.","I've been attracted to this set since its release in 2010, but the hefty price tag kept me away from it. Recently, I was able to score this and the Hoth Wampa Cave for a decent price, and I have them both sitting on my desk. Although I don't have any of the earlier versions of the Slave I, I can tell you that the set is an immensely satisfying build and an excellent display piece. <br><br>The first thing you'll build are the minifigures, which for some, are probably the selling point of the set. It's easy to see why - they are excellent. Han Solo looks great, with a nice printed body and his trademark smirk. Bobba Fett looks awesome, including a jetpack, helmet, and fantastic printed body. He also includes a bag of ""gear"" that I remember being included with some Clone Wars sets. Besides for a comm antennae, you'll probably ignore these accessories as they look totally out of place on Bobba. Bossk is also fantastic, with some great back printing and a new mold for the head. All three minifigures included with this set are exclusives (they better be for $79.99!). <br><br>Another noteworthy inclusion is a new mold for frozen Han Solo's carbonate. On it's own, it's a great piece, but Han Solo can be placed inside the brick for added playability. It's a great feature that pleasantly surprised me. I believe this same carbonate brick is being included with this Summer's Jabba's Palace set.<br><br>Now on to the model itself. In a word, it's great. The building experience is one of the most satisfying I've had in a long time. A huge number of sloped pieces and smart construction make the set sturdy, sleek, and heavy on SNOT techniques. It's also quite large - much larger than I was expecting. In a way, it's size is a bit of a drawback, since it can be difficult to play with. (I still manage.)<br><br>I've heard some complaints regarding the colors of the 2010 Slave I. Apparently, they're much too vibrant. Personally, I don't mind it in the least - it makes the model look new, and doesn't hurt the aesthetics at all. I imagine the movie version was more ""faded"" only because it was an older paint job, and this is intended to be a hot-off-the-line bounty hunter hotrod. Unless you're an accuracy purist, I doubt the colors will bother you much. I didn't even notice until I read the complaints. <br><br>There are a couple of ""play"" features in the 2010 Slave I. The wings along the side of the vessel are controlled by gravity, meaning that they'll swivel depending on how you're holding the ship. It works well enough, but they do tend to dangle a bit during play. A bigger problem is the cockpit - Bobba's seat is supposed to swivel with the wings, but his antennae accessory prevents the wings from swiveling all the way back during ""flight"" mode. To me, this seems like a huge design oversight! The cockpit itself is pretty weak, too - there's nothing to indicate a chair at all. I would be happier with a more detailed cockpit and less articulated wings. <br><br>That is the biggest issue with the set, however. Nothing else seems to stand out. There are ""rapid fire"" flick fire missiles hidden in the chest of the vessel, and you'll be surprised to know that they work quite well. Much better than the standard-issue flick fire missiles, although those are also included in another hidden compartment. The carbonate brick can be stored beneath a boarding ramp in the rear of the vessel, which is nice. <br><br>My favorite part about this set is the overall look of it. It appears very nicely proportioned, and aside from the colors, very movie accurate. The secret weapon systems are very cool and cleverly disguised. Although it only includes three minifigures, they are all exclusive to this set, which makes it a very nice buy. <br><br>The biggest problem is the price. At $79.99 for 573 parts, it's a tough sell. If you can find it for $59.99 or lower, I would HIGHLY recommend you pick it up! The set is just outstanding, especially if you haven't owned one of the previous versions of the Slave I. However, for the retail price I am on the fence. $79.99 is a lot of money that could be spent on other things. If you have the cash available, and don't have the older Slave I, then this set is for you. Otherwise, you could be forgiven for giving this set a pass. <br><br>8.5/10 - Recommended <br>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-10T06:15:12.313Z","LEGO Star Wars - Slave I Review","<p>This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as wel.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This set has two instructions and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 573 pieces and for 79.99 USD I think it was really worth the money - even if it is 14 cents per piece. We get a lot of nice molds like the new carbonite piece which looks really detailed to the movie and it's very amazing, too. We also ge a nice big windscreen piece and a new head mold for Bossk which comes in it's own little bag. The're also a lot of other cool small and big pieces in this set which are always great to have.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs are very nice, too. Han Solo has a very nice looking shirt and his face looks really nice, too. Bossk is one of the new figures. He has never been made before and he looks very detailed as well. The head looks very cool and it's very easy to adjust it full 360Â°. Boba Fett is one of my favourite figures in this set. I'm really impressed how detailed this figure is. The helmet piece has very nice markings and the torso has much better markings than the ones on the older Boba Fett versions. The face looks very nice, too.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This set took me a while but it was a lot of fun to build it. We also get a few stickers with this set. This set has some really interesting techniques like the feature where you can push the flick-missiles.</p>

The windscreen can be opened and you have a look in the inside of the cockpit. If you move this vehicle into flight mode the cockpit and the wings will adjust.

On each side is a container and between the container where you can see the flick-missiles and the turrets is a part where you can push a container out. On the front you can also see a place which can be opened and where you can see a lot of flick-missiles, too. You can push those if you hit the button on the back of the Slave I where you can see the very detailed engine. I really love the design of this model and I have to say that the details on it are very amazing, too.

"HikerCZ","2013-03-20T09:09:45.357Z","A true Star Wars classic","My first Slave ship and for a third incarnation not bad at all. Some people might complain about the colour scheme being too vibrant, however, in the movies the ship had gone through quite a lot of beating, so a new ship would have probably looked just like that. Other than that the design is superb and the ship looks excellent from all angles (even the bottom). <br><br>A major improvement over the older model is the carbonite version with minifig Han Solo - the design and the fact you can actually place the minifig inside was one of the reasons I got the set (and if you don't intend to buy Jabba's Palace, the only chance to have it). Other minifigs look perfect as well, Boba Fett has a great face under the helmet. <br><br>Another positive feature is high playability. The whole concept with firing missiles is very clever and must be a thrill for kids to engage in all kinds of battles. <br><br>The drawbacks are not too many to mention, nevertheless in my case the cockpit cover doesn't hold properly so if you grab the ship by it, it stays in your hand. Also one of my stickers was bent and tends to peel off. And for some people this is the major problem - the price is quite high - obviously because of some exclusive molds - so my advice is to get it on sale as I did and it was a bargain. <br><br>To sum up, Slave I is an iconic ship and if you're a fan of SW, you won't be disappointed. If you already have the previous model, you can skip this one. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Bricky_Dee_Williams","2014-07-23T12:43:49.45Z","Bounty Hunters!","<p>I got this set as a gift for Christmas 2010, and it was the second biggest set I got, which means it was the second one I built! And I was amazed with the finished product! This latest version of Boba Fett&#39;s&nbsp;spaceship, once his father&#39;s. I want to first say the set inventory does not disappoint, with many light greens, dark reds, &nbsp;greys and tans. The minifigures are great additions to the set, and the set itself is big enough for them all.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set came in a box depicting the scene in Cloud&nbsp;City, with the ship flying in its upright position, firing lasers out of I it&#39;s rotating laser cannons at the bottom. The instructions, which there are two of them, are pretty even, with the first book covering wing flaps and interior design, along with the bottom of the ship and basic infrastructure. The second book covers the top building of the ship, the main covering for the interior. They&#39;re pretty easy to follow, and the steps are mainly easy and short.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As I said before, the parts come in a great variety of colors, some more than others. We get new rounded, semi-angled pieces in dark green, many sloped bricks in dark red, and of course the classic Slave I windshield cover piece from the last couple. We also get the brand new Han Solo in Carbonite piece, redesigned for the set so Han can fit under it. We also get pieces like the flaps on the front of the wings, which are held in by the &quot;click&quot; elevation system, and many others including curved edge pieces as seen on the front, that also make up the ship&#39;s bottom.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are three new and mainly exclusive minifigures, seen for the first time in this set:</p>

<p>-Boba Fett: So far this is the fifth version of. Boba, counting the White Boba, young Boba, original Boba, and the rare Boba with printed arms and&nbsp;legs. He comes with a new Star Wars accessory bag, wich includes pistols, armor, and helmet coms. His helmet, for the first time ever, is not connected to his jetpack, which is a new helmet piece. He comes in much nicer light green and grey, with a new torn and tattered dark red-brown shred of a cape. He also comes with a Star Wars gun from the last few years that includes a technic piece on the end.</p>

<p>-Bossk: First seen in this set, Bossk&nbsp;is an all new minifigure. He has a specially molded head piece,an exclusive torso piece, and yellow legs with a light grey connecting piece in between. The torso is made to represent Bossk&#39;s space suit from The Empire Strikes Back, and Bossk&#39;s weapon included in the set is a long barreled Star Wars rifle.</p>

<p>-Han Solo: Not really much to say about Han, as he has dark brown legs, a rumpled white shirt for a torso, and his classic hair and head piece. However, Han&#39;s niche in the set is to clip into the brand new Carbonite piece, which fits minifigures perfectly, but his gave is different. In the Carbonite piece, his face is twisted with pain, but asleep. He appears in set 9516 with a sleepy face matching the Carbonite piece expression.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build takes less than two hours, maybe about one and a half. There aren&#39;t many technic functions except on the bottom and then one on the top for the blue-tipped&nbsp;missile compartment. It is end rally easy, adding just a few pieces at a time. This version has some pieces that are fragile and fall of easy, which is a distraction in the course of building the set. The way to avoid this is to make sure the pieces are securely interlocked with the piece they rest on.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is smaller than expected, but altogether wonderful. The guns on the end of the ship swivel practically 360 degrees, and the missiles behind them fold out to come out of their little compartment,&nbsp;which has folding doors that open downwards. The cockpit windshield piece comes off easily, and Boba and Bossk fit nicely into the compartment, Boba in the seat with the controls, and Bossk sitting behind at the front of the ship. The missile launching system, hidden in the interior middle of the ship, works and functions nicely, with a stud attached at the end so the technic piece dogs not slip out after all four missiles are deployed. The wings on the sides roll back and forth in when you tip the spaceship upward, as if it were really flying. I am very pleased with the completed model.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Verdict: Get it, especially if you are a Star Wars fan.</p>

<p>I, as I believe others are, feel this set is absolutely great. The set is a semi-easy build, and amounts to a set better than other versions before it. Also, the rare colored pieces go great with any collection.&nbsp;Unlike other Star&nbsp;Wars&nbsp;sets that get worse as they are remade, this set doesn&#39;t fail to disappoint. The trio of minifigures go well with the set, and all fit in nicely. Which reminds me. Han in Carbonite is tucked into the cargo bay on the back of the ship. He fits very well in the ship too. The set has far more cons than pros, so here they are.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Great, stable build</p>

<p>-Awesome minifigures</p>

<p>-Everything fits well inside the ship, with storage for the ccessory pack pieces.</p>

<p>-Pieces come in rare colors.</p>

<p>-Price isn&#39;t too much over regular retail price as of 2014.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Honestly, none.</p>
