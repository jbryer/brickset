<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It comes with 6 awesome minifigs. Such as Aayla Secura, Cad Bane, Ahsoka Tano, Anakin Skywalker, Clone Commander, and a Clone Trooper.</p>

<p>Moves great with it's 10 wheels.</p>
<p>So big</p>
<p>Also, comes with a command center and a small AT-RT.</p>

I actually built this set using pieces from my own Lego collection, it was very fun to build, and the details on it are amazing, It is also larger than most pictures make it look!! I love it but there are some pre-cautions that people should know. </p>
<p>The interior is cool but very hallow and frail. Also it is fragil in certain parts of the Lego Set. But overall this set is very cool and is a very large addition to anyone's Star Wars, Clone Wars collection!!</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4

"birgoyle","2010-07-31T11:16:32.453Z","Finally a mini-fig of Aayla!","<p>This set rates very low in value for money - I got it on sale for AU$189.00 (US$170 &amp; 131 EUR), but its RRP is AU$240 (US$217 &amp; 166 EUR). Let's just say thank heavens for Australia's mid-year toy sales. <br />
<br />
I have the original Turbo Tank 7261, and this set is very similar in almost every way. That being said, for anyone who didn't get the original this would be a great addition to any clone wars collection. <br />
<br />
This is another set that looks almost exactly like its movie counterpart, even down to the wheels. The best features are the mini AT-RT and command centre that clips into the doors of the cargo hold, and of course the irresistible minifigs that come with this set. <br />
<br />
The figs of Aayla Secura and Cad Bane are highly detailed. Aayla has been a long time coming, since she appeared in Episode II in 2002. The leather strap detailing and the body print are great, and matches the real Aayla perfectly. <br />
Cad Bane's breathing apparatus is a nice touch, instead of simply printing them on the head or torso (Clone &amp; Imperial pilots come to mind). Cad's hat on the other hand borders on the comical, the brim being far too wide, but still suits him. <br />
The rest are stock standard and can be found in a multitude of other clone wars sets. <br />
<br />
One big flaw of this (and the original) set is the gaps in armour between the base and the side armour plates. If looking at it from above, you won't notice, but from below it looks almost unfinished. Also the windscreens being simple flat plates on the outside of the armour looks a little silly. The only other flaw is that this set is missing the scout's lookout at the back, which the original set had. On this version, it is simply a dish that creates the illusion of the lookout being lowered inside the cargo hold. <br />
<b><br />
Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Great minifigs - finally Aayla makes an appearance</li>
    <li>Mini AT-RT &amp; Command Station</li>
    <li>Suspension system works well</li>
    <li>Extensive build</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Windscreens are not see through</li>
    <li>No scout look-out</li>
    <li>Gaps in the armour</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall 4/5 - well worth having, if only for Aayla Secura &amp; Cad Bane.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,2

I LOVE this set.</div><div><br></div><div>Minifigures: 5/5</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>- Anakin Skywalker: Nothing unique, nothing really out of the ordinary.</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>- Ahsoka Tano: Since I only have one other Ahsoka minifig (AT-TE) this minifig is &nbsp; &nbsp;very welcome for me.</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>- Aayla Secura: FINALLY! One of the best Jedi Knights around and she only &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;comes &nbsp;out in 2010? But I'm not complaining. Aayla is a fantastic minifig and &nbsp; &nbsp;LEGO has &nbsp;done &nbsp;a superb job.</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>- Cad Bane: I don't quite get why Cad Bane is in this set, but as with Aayla, I'm &nbsp; &nbsp;not complaining! He is a truly awesome minifig.</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>- 2x Clone Trooper: Same old, same old. But still awesome.</div><div><br></div><div>AT-RT Walker: 5/5</div><div><br></div><div>The AT-RT walker that comes in this set is awesome. It is perfectly to scale and the way LEGO made it able to slide into the interior walls of the Turbo Tank hangar is nothing short of genius. There is absolutely nothing to complain about with the AT-RT.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Clone Command Platform: 5/5</div><div><br></div><div>I think that the Command Platform is really cool. You can fit two minifigs quite comfortably on it and it is also cleverly designed to, like the AT-RT, be able to slide into the interior hangar walls of the tank itself.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Gun Rack: 5/5</div><div><br></div><div>It works fine. It slides nicely into the Turbo Tank. What else can I say?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Turbo Tank: 10/5</div><div><br></div><div>This version of the Clone Turbo Tank is much better than the old 2005 version in my opinion, and also in my opinion is one of the greatest LEGO sets ever made. There is a vast variety of pieces for the build and they all make sure that the overall structure of the tank is sturdy and durable. The carrying handle is surprisingly strong and can carry the heavy weight of the tank with ease. The playability of this set is also good, however I would have liked a few droids to make it more like a battle. After all, how fair is a massive tank, three Jedi and two clones against one bounty hunter? The price is a big issue for lots of people who are interested in sets such as the Clone Turbo Tank. In New Zealand, pure awesomeness - the Clone Turbo Tank - costs around $300 (NZD). However my Dad bought two and sold the first on TradeMe, so he gave me an incredible discount off the set and sold it to me for $140. So for me, the price is very good. But for others, the huge price tag on this set could prove to be the difference between getting it and being happy in bankruptcy or not getting it and being unhappy in financial security. So I agree with most others when I say that the price is ridiculous, but I gave the price a 5/5 purely based on how much I got it for. So don't say this review was unhelpful just because you don't think the price is 5/5 material.&nbsp;</div><div>The features of the tank are really cool. The large hangar area can be used to store either minifigs, nothing or the Command Platform, the AT-RT and one minifig. As I mentioned earlier in my review, the Command Platform and the AT-RT are designed so that they can slide into slots in the interior of the hangar walls and not fall out when you put them back up, so there are no problems with that at all. The armour plates are great and ensure maximum protection to the top and sides of the Turbo Tank; however the armour is a little lacking on the bottom. But I don’t really care.&nbsp;</div><div>The wheels are also great and the suspension system in the middle of the five sets allows the tank to turn with ease. The Tank also glides smoothly across lots of different surfaces, and works especially well on carpet. The turret at the back of the Turbo Tank is quite cool, and the one in the middle looks cool as well and the latter also works well if you can manage not to remove the whole turret from the tank. The interior of both the front and the back control bays are simple yet good for what they are required to do, and I have found that they can fit 3-4 minifigs in each one, meaning that it doesn’t matter that the AT-RT and the Command Platform take up most of the hangar.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Overall: 5/5</div><div><br></div><div>Overall this is a fantastic set, and I would happily recommend it to anyone.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"STARWARSFREAK","2011-03-02T03:03:37.107Z","Hmmmm,","I honestly do not think that this set is better than it's 2005 counterpart. For me i find this set has a number of features that are some what disappointing and affects the design in a circumvent way. When i first saw this set i was very excited because it looked like a stupendous remake and a incredulous model full of immaculate detail however i was wrong.<br><br>For me one of the most distracting and almost disgusting design is the wheels. When i look at the set the wheels don't all seem to be spaced out evenly (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">And yes i took my time with the instructions with pin - point accuracy and precision making sure the set was built to immaculate expectations</span>) and i find that when i start looking at the wheels there's a set of three and then a set of 2, like this if you were looking at a side view, ooo oo &lt;-- Basically like that. I think the 2005 version is much better and the wheel s actually look more appealing, they with a much brighter appearance look like this, ooooo &lt;-- which is what the wheels are meant to look like. <br><br>I also find the AT-RT design ... Horrible compared to the AT-RT counterpart 2005. I find it's way to small and weak looking. I also find the design very tacky as if they have just quickly made a design and thrown it in to ad something extra to the set.<br><br>I also find the Aayla Secura ... annoying. When i first say the very first Clone Wars Mini-figures in 2008 everyone kept saying how ugly they looked, however i rejected those facts i chose to like the figures because i thought they weren't to bad. But now we are getting all these Mini-figures we have wanted for years like Aayla Secura, The new Ki-Adi-Mundi and even Palpatine, AND THEY DON'T MATCH OUR OTHER FIGURES! Oh it's horrible having these cartoonist characters sided up to our realistic and innocent 2 dot black eyed Mini-figures. <br><br>I also find the design lacking something, I almost feel like it looks cheap or something like not much effort put in to it. <br><br>Anyway these are all ""MY OPINIONS"", and i just happen to feel this way about the set. If you want my advice go with the 2005 Clone Turbo Tank, the one with a choice of a Light Up Lightsaber Mace Windu or the very first Non Light Up Lightsaber Mace Windu which you can only get in the 2005 Clone Turbo Tank. Get the 2005 Clone Turbo Tank if you want an even more thought out and classically precise model of the Clone Turbo Tank with it's Scout Trooper and other incredible accessories. <br><br>I know this review isn't helpful to people who love this set, but I'm just posting it to say my opinion. <br>",TRUE,3,4,4,4,3
"jb_builder","2011-03-24T02:32:57.143Z","Suspension is amazing","<p>I got this set for my birthday. And I did not think it was the Clone Turbo Tank when it was still in&nbsp;the wraping paper&nbsp;because the box was so small. But that does not matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&nbsp;I well start with the mini figs. First of all Aayla Secura is amazing.&nbsp;Everything on her is great. Ahsoka is no different then the one that comes with the&nbsp;ATTE&nbsp;[2008]. Anakin is as lame as ever. The Clones are the same and&nbsp;Cad Bane is nice if you dont have him. </p>
<p>Now for the turbo&nbsp;tank. The suspension is amazing if you&nbsp;put ten pounds of bricks on the floor you could push it through the bricks and not get stuck!! The interior is kind of bad and small): The cockpits are fine and&nbsp;they are a good size. The outside is awsome. However there is no look out tower but it is better that way(: The ATRT is nice and much better then the one that comes with the&nbsp;clone walker pack [2009]&nbsp;It has a drop ship connector if you have not noticed that yet. And has a cool but vulnerable turret. </p>
<p>The build was good but the wheels were lame kind of&nbsp;like the legs on the ATTE [2008]. </p>

<p>the box has the new style and a compelling action shot. the instructions were... well instructions. no complaints here.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>A lot of plates and technic. Not much special, but a very good variety none the less.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>6 of them. Cad Bane, Aayla Secura, Ahsoka whatsername, Anakin...again&gt;:( and 2 clones. not a bad haul, but this tank has 4 pilot/ copilot seats, a manned turret, an AT RT and a huge troop hold. A clone pilot and gunner would be appreciated.&nbsp;The jedi are cool, but Anakin is way to common (i have 3 of the guy) and is honestly pretty ugly(even for a Clone Wars fig.)&nbsp;. Then there is Cad Bane. There are 3 jedi, 2 clones, an AT RT and we cant forget the turbo tank, all against this Cad Bane guy? Noboby is <em>that </em>good. He just needs some backup is all.</p>
<h4>The build </h4>
<p>The build was pretty quick for a vehicle this size(took me around 4 hours...i think). Not much repetition, just a 2x here and a 2x there.&nbsp;the shape&nbsp;came together fast in the last little bit. Good stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completd model looks spectacular. It plays spactacular too. With the big wheels, you can roll over anything (or one) and there are plenty of extras to keep you busy.</p>

"tomalphin","2014-01-12T14:10:33.597Z","Well-designed model with repetitive construction.","<p><strong>About me: </strong>I am an AFOL, and I build most small sets as a &quot;puzzle build&quot; (without using the instructions.) &nbsp;This set is too large so I used the instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Initial impressions:</strong> I love the original Star Wars trilogy, but have limited experience with the prequels or the clone wars.&nbsp; That said, this set did have some familiarity, as I recognized the many drones as well as a young Anakin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was one of many sets in a large lot I bought on Craigslist.&nbsp; Since I did not seek this set out, and I&#39;m unfamilair with the inspiration, this review focuses on the construction process and completed vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience:</strong> The build begins with the creation of a very long technics chassis - longer than I expected the completed vehicle would be.&nbsp; The build process leans heavy on technics and hinges to achieve the unusual angles.&nbsp; I found the build a bit boring at first, as it is not only symmetrical from side to side, it is fairly symmetrical from front to back.&nbsp; It also has a ridiculous number of wheels, and 8 of the 10 wheels attach using the same repetitive process.&nbsp; That said, the central wheels which stabilize the vehicle are well designed and it&#39;s an interesting part of the project to see come to life.</p>

<p><strong>Finished model:</strong> Like so many projects, this really came to life as I finished the final details.&nbsp; I really liked how the robot and machinery slides into panels attached to the doors.&nbsp; The finished model is very playable - it even features a handle which slides up and down to aid in dragging it over uneven terrain (such as my laundry pile.)</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: 6/10 on a 10-point scale.&nbsp; This loses a lot of appeal as I am not attached to the theme, and the build process is pretty repetitive, but the end result is a decent looking and playable model.</p>

<p><em><strong>Using the instructions, this model took about 3.5 hours to build.</strong>&nbsp; (Searching for the right parts took some of this time since they weren&#39;t all separated from a larger lot.)</em></p>

"VenatorBricks","2019-06-08T14:45:37.177Z","The best model of the Clone Turbo Tank!","<h2>Set:</h2>

<p>The set itself is a neat model. This is one of the best sets, besides the 7675 AT-TE Walker, from the Clone Wars subtheme.</p>

<h2>Price:</h2>

<p>For an original retail price of $120, you pretty much get what you expect. Nowadays, a set of this size would cost about $150.</p>

<h2>Playability:</h2>

<p>This set has multiple playability features. You can open the doors on the side to reveal a command center and a mini AT-RT Walker. The guns on the top of the vehicle and rotatable. The guns of the front are able to be moved up and down. The wheels spin very well, and if you lean the push&nbsp;section of the tank into one direction, a spring in the wheel system turns all the wheel that direction. So basically, turn the top section of the tank to one direction, and the wheels will do the same. I&rsquo;ve always loved just &ldquo;driving&rdquo; it around on the floor.</p>

<h2>Display:</h2>

<p>The set doesn&rsquo;t look as good on display as the 2016 model, but it still stands out at a massive republic vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures:</h2>

<p>This set has THREE jedi, a bounty hunter, and two clones. I know that Aayla Secura fetches a high price, so collectors will love owning her minifigure. I&#39;ve always loved the Clone Wars clones (2008-2011) more than any other. Cad Bane is also a very well detailed figure.</p>

<h2>Overall:</h2>

<p>This set is recommended to tweens and collectors. There are enough play features to make it worth it. Collectors&nbsp;will also love the rare figures included with this set.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-05-01T06:58:56.733Z","Very impressive model with lots of playability ","<p>This model does not disappoint. It&rsquo;s massive, jam packed with play features, and can carry a boatload (or is that a tankload) of minifigures. Not to mention it comes with some very cool minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>So let me start by saying that I have never seen The Clone Wars or any other TV series, I am strictly a fan of the movies. However, despite my lack of familiarity with the characters I still really like them a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First off you get 2 standard clone troopers. This is no way near enough, and personally I would have liked one specialized clone trooper. However, I&rsquo;m glad that you get the other more unique minifigures&nbsp;with the set, you can always buy battle packs to build an army.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anakin&nbsp;you can tell is a Clone Wars version as the minifigure looks very cartoonish. I actually like it a lot, but it doesn&rsquo;t mesh too well with my more realistic minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aayla&nbsp;Secura&nbsp;is a very cool minifigure, and since she does appear (very briefly) in Episodes 2 and 3, I am somewhat familiar with her being a Jedi. Her alien features come completely from her hairpiece, she has a standard head other than the fact it&rsquo;s blue. But it is an excellent looking minifigure.</p>

<p>Ahsoka Tano is very similar to Aayla in that it is her hairpiece that gives her her alien features. However, I don&rsquo;t recall ever seeing her in any of the movies. Nonetheless, she is an excellent looking minifigure and it&rsquo;s always nice to have another alien as part of your collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last minifigure is Cad Bane, another character who I am unfamiliar with. To me he is the least interesting. He wears a large fedora, which to me looks very out of place in the Star Wars universe, but I suppose it is probably true to his character in the Clone Wars. The only thing special about him is he has some sort of breathing apparatus around his neck. But unlike the two Jedi, there is nothing alien looking about him other than the color of his skin.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>You start off this set with 3 smaller builds that can be stored inside the model but are really separate mini models on their own. You have an elaborate gun rack, a mobile command center, and a walker. The first two aren&rsquo;t too interesting, but the walker is rather enjoyable and has some very cool SNOT techniques. Don&rsquo;t expect this to be an AT-ST, it is much smaller. If an AT-ST is a yacht, then this walker is like a jet ski. It&rsquo;s probably a little too complex for a polybag build, but these three builds are effectively all polybag sized.</p>

<p>The actual turbo tank&nbsp;is a very large build with most of it being constructing the base and middle, which is where it gets it&rsquo;s entire structure from. The base is very heavy duty being constructed of large technic bricks and secured with large plates. You will spend the majority of the build constructing this as well as what appears to be a very light frame but turns out to be very sturdy. The model relies on technic very heavily to give the frame strength which allows it to be very light and open. As you build this portion of the model there is no repetition although it does seem to develop slowly. This is mainly due to the huge size of the model, after using the larger bricks on the base, building up requires many smaller bricks at various points throughout the model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The base construction concludes with the assembly of the center set of wheels. These are actually very elaborate and dynamic with working struts. It is quite enjoyable constructing them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After this comes the other 4 sets of wheels, which are actually two sets of identical pairs. With each set that makes up a pair being very similar. As a result you need to repeat the same build 8 times which becomes very tedious. I found it best to repeat each step 8 times, rather than to go back and repeat the entire process 8 times. While my method did seem to go faster as you memorize the process, it becomes very boring.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally it is time to build the panels which will give this set its final look. While there is some repetition with the side panels, they are fairly simple and use bricks, not technic. Of course, to break up the repetition you also are building the top, front, and back panels at this time. As a result this part of the build is rather enjoyable, and since you don&rsquo;t need to dig through a huge pile of bricks anymore, it is rather enjoyable. Plus, as you add on each panel to the model you see the model coming together which gives you a sense of accomplishment as well as amazement at how well the model was designed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It took me about three and a half hours to build, it is a little deceptive as you will start out building large portions of it at the start, but then the build slows down as you start working with smaller parts and details. So don&rsquo;t be like me and start the build at 10:30 at night or you will be falling asleep at work the next day!</p>

<p><b>The</b> <strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>Everything about this model is amazing. Even though nearly half its size comes from the wheels, the model is still huge and roomy. The details go all around the tank so it looks great at any point from any angle. And unlike the Millennium Falcon sets that have tons of gaps between the angled plates, the angled plates in this set fit together perfectly like a jigsaw puzzle, not one single little gap in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Turbo Tank is designed to carry a lot. The main cargo bay holds the walker and mobile command center, both of which slide securely onto either side panel (which fold down) and can be locked into place. Without these two mini builds this area can be used to carry minifigures, I haven&rsquo;t tried to see how many I could fit in, but I would think that you could easily hold 20 minifigures in this one compartment alone. However, with the mini builds, you can still seat a minifigure on the walker and two more in the command center and you won&rsquo;t have any problem closing it up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other side of the center post is a small compartment for the armory, where the gun rack can slide in or out. Their really isn&rsquo;t anything else that you could use this space for, and it is only designed to hold 4 blasters which seems a little limited to me, but at the same time, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to dedicate any more space to an armory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The front and rear cockpits are similarly sized, both featuring seats for two minifigures&nbsp;and a decent amount of standing room for a few more. They are a little tight to access. Their tops open up and towards the middle of the tank. The &ldquo;windshields&rdquo; open down. However, the side panels only open out very slightly, so you really need to work your fingers between them, but since it is a very wide model this hopefully won&rsquo;t cause you too much trouble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two drawbacks to this model. First it has 2 identical stickers, these could have so easily been prints, but they do add a splash of color to the front and look nice. Second is the floor of the tank. While the top and sides may have no gaps, the bottom has huge gaping holes along all sides. It is like a lion enclosure at a zoo. Seriously, would it have cost that much more to include a few more plates to give us a larger floor? As a result the model can&rsquo;t hold quite as many minifigures&nbsp;as you would think. However, the model is so well designed and can hold so many minifigures that I am willing to look past this problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Playability</b></p>

<p>Holy cow! The wheels alone are awesome. The center wheels are on working struts. The rest of the axels&nbsp;are connected by a single technic pin in their center, giving them a wide range of motion. Combine this with the massive wheels and you can roll this tank over anything. Not even a pile of Hot Wheels could get in its way. And even better yet, if you want to turn, just angle the tank to one side and the wheels align to turn it in that direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the 4 interior seats, there is a rooftop gunner seat that can hold a fifth minifigure, so all 5 good guys (assuming you can consider clone troopers good guys) have a place to sit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A handle pulls up from the center of the model and despite seeming small, it actually gives you all the strength you need to carry this model safely between rooms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is one flick fire missile which doesn&rsquo;t work too well, in fact the entire structure comes off when I try to flick it. The set of course predates the spring loaded missile launchers, but I don&rsquo;t think it would be too difficult to redesign it to incorporate these if it were important to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the mobile command center is a little too static to really offer any play value, the small walker is quite nice and is very well built for play.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t more highly recommend this set. It is incredibly well designed, looks great, other than the wheels it is a very fun build that you can learn a lot from, it contains an excellent collection of minifigures, and offers a lot of playability. While it does contain a lot of very small bricks in its brick count, it also contains a lot of extremely large bricks, so I would say that the brick count is very appropriate for a model of this size. All you need to do with this set is build up a clone army and you will be good to go. If you get the opportunity to pick up this set, don&rsquo;t pass it up, it is well worth every penny.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is&nbsp;this my favorite Star Wars set? No, I still prefer my Falcon for the simple fact that it&rsquo;s the Millennium Falcon! But this is a better model and offers a lot more playability. I can say that it is without a doubt my second favorite Star Wars set.&nbsp;</p>
