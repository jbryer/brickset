"Superbrick555","2010-12-09T12:22:55.38Z","Worst Set Of 2010","<p>So i bought this set over the summer haven't had time to review. But as you see in the title it is the worst set of 2010. And For me it is the worst set i have ever bought</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts</p>
<p>Worst parts ever dump , belt , and the firepit are all connect through 3 pieces of flat long pieces when you pick it up it falls apart. The tower falls down with the pillars. I'm using the set now as pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playabilty</p>
<p>NO playabilty what so ever you spin the belt gear and it either A. Falls Apart B. Doesn't Work or C. It gets Jamed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building Experience</p>
<p>I had too re-build it 2 times till i got it right with out it breaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money </p>
<p>DON'T BUY THIS SET IT IS HORRIABLE 50 DOLLARS IS REDICOULUS FOR THIS SET</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall</p>
<p>If you get this set for christmas dont even open it because you will be steaming while you are building. The only good thing about this set is spare pieces.</p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
"jlegofan","2011-07-12T18:30:23.593Z","Cool set, but needs a little work.","<p>This set is pretty cool. Now, I'm not a fan of Toy Story, but this could easily be a Power Miners set or something similar. (without the minifigs)</p><p>Now for the minifigs. There are five: <strong>Lotso, Woody, Hamm, and two aliens.</strong></p><p>Lotso is decent, I guess. He is torn from being in the garbage truck. Woody is different than a lot of minifigs. He has three studs on the back of his legs unstead of just two. His head is huge and looks terrible on a regular minifigure's body and legs. His arms are also very long. He, along with all of the characters in the set, are worn from the garbage truck. Hamm is kind of cool because you can put coins inside of him. He has lots of yellow and blue paint on him. The aliens are okay, nothing special though.</p><p>The crane is cool, and it comes with a lot of dark green parts. The winch system is cool, but you have to manually make it pick up minifigs. It can fit two aliens inside.The control tower&nbsp;is okay, all it really is is a little&nbsp;station with some dials and switches.</p><p>The conveyer belt works fairly well. You turn a gear to make the bucket dump a minifig onto the belt. Sometimes minifigs get stuck and you have to move them to where they are supposed to go. You then turn another gear on the side of the belt which makes the minifig fall into the pit of fire. (sometimes they will miss, though.) The fire pit itself is cool, it is big and fits lots of minifigs. (if you don't put Lotso in, he takes up a lot&nbsp;of space.)</p><p>Now for the price. I wouldn't have bought this set at the full retail price, $49.99, I got it at Walmart for $36.54. </p><p>Overall a good set. Fairly sturdy and good features.&nbsp;Just don't buy it at the retail price, and you'll like it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3

This is a really cool set lots of things in it but if your thinking of buying this set, its only availble from Argos and the&nbsp;LEGO website: http://<a href=""http://www.lego.com"">www.lego.com</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"horizon123","2010-12-28T04:51:30.573Z","Coool! ","<p>A very cool &amp; playable set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great minifigs. Good technique parts but still&nbsp;good to build by kids (6yr old). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only thing missing in way are connectors between the two towers (control &amp; crane) and the belt. Plus an extra minfig would be nice (jessie, buzz, bull's eye or even the 3rd alien).</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
