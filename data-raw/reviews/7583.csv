So this set was not the butter and bread you were waiting for but it was still worth a wait. first of all I disiprove e of the dissipointing layout of this set. Its too small and breaks easily. The characters look awkward in a bad way. Your going to let some kid play with a small train with bad looking characters. The parts I enjoy,there was lots of new and funny looking pieces. The price wasn't a worth. Save your money and go watch the movie than buy this set.",FALSE,3,4,3,3,2
"Duq","2010-10-11T09:59:01.873Z","Colourful train but flimsy","I bought this set because I like trains and I kinda like Toy Story. With this set I get Woody, Jessie, Buzz, Hamm and Rex. Having built it I'm not quite sure what the set is meant for...<br><br>Building is easy; each car comes in its own numbered bag and there are two for the engine. The front of the engine may be tricky for the youngest builders but other than that there are no strange building techniques used. The base of all three cars is the same and as has been said before the step where the baseplate goes onto the wheels assembly is not easy.<br><br>The proportions of the cars are odd; even shorter and higher than normal Lego train cars. The height is good for Woody and Jessie making them way too tall for minifigs so these cars won't fit in with other Lego trains.<br>The engine looks cute with some nice touches. Early images showed driving rods on the large wheels but apparently they were too difficult and they have been dropped. A real shame as those driving rods are an essential part of a steam engine.<br><br>While looking nice the front is flimsy. The cylinders keep popping off and everything is bending in all directions. The large wheels are on a bogie (a sub-frame that can turn). This is necessary for running on Lego rails but looks strange when the train is used on the living room floor. All this is costing points on playability which is otherwise pretty good with all the characters, the crate of dynamite, the trap door and other doors that open.<br><br>There's a nice selection of parts; doors, windows and curves in various colours, lots of train wheels and buffers and of course the Toy Story characters including Hamm with hat. Those parts don't come cheap though. The current passenger train costs â‚¬20 more but includes track, motor and remote control.<br><br>So it's a bit simple for a display model and a bit flimsy for a play model. There's a nice selection of parts but you do pay for that Disney logo...<br>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,2
"sadunanik","2010-06-18T06:44:39.187Z","Only for die hard Toy Story fans","<p>We are a big fan of Lego train sets so it was really exciting waitign for Western Train Chase to be delivered. First impressions, the box was very nicely designed busrting with bright colors. The minifigures are fun, this was our first Toy Story set and it came with a good collection of characters. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building was not very difficult for my 6 year old son, except for the quality of the baseplates of the cars. It was exceptionally difficult to stick the wheel assembly&nbsp;to the baseplate. My son asked for help, which he does rarely, and I realised that it was not possible for me to just press the parts together to make them stick. I had to put the baseplate upsidedown on the table and use my weight to press down the wheel assembly to make it snap together. Lookign at the baseplate closely under light, it did not have the usual smooth black surface on top.&nbsp; We had this problem with every baseplate during construction while attaching the wheel assembly. Looks like this part is not manufactered to the quality standards I expect from Lego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once complete, the model is fun to play with. The cars and the minifigs are very cute. The Engine looks good but it is flimsy. The black cylinder part is thin and stands high above rails. The front wheel assembly&nbsp;is probably the weakest part. The nice thing was there were two spare large train wheels in the bag which you can use to build your alterantive engines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that surprised me is how small the train is. The cars are very short and the engine is as small as one can possibly build a steam engine. I felt that&nbsp;Emerald Night is twice as big as this train although it costs 25% more. This is a nice but optional addition to your railyard.&nbsp;I think it will be challanging to fit the train with RC motor, that is our next project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a Toy Story fan, then you will apprecaite the set a lot more. As our first Toy Story set, my son is having a lot of fun playing with it.</p>

"calvinwashere2","2010-06-28T12:00:42.46Z","A train that fails to reach its potential","This train had the potential to be a really nice set for younger kids - it's colorful, has a lot of popular Toy Story characters, and is an easy build. All of that is nice, BUT it doesn't quite make the grade because the build quality is poor, by that I'm referring mainly to the engine.&nbsp;Once built it isn't sturdy. Move it around the track a few times and pieces starts to drop off or bend in ways that make it look like a messed up train. Also, I tried adapting to be motorized but the front cow-plow part is flimsy and doesn't seem to balance the train well and makes for a quick derailment. The rest of the cabins are nice though since there is plenty of room for kids to act out different scenarios and play with the characters but a good train set should get that part right first and foremost.",FALSE,3,4,4,4,3
"RTW","2010-09-07T17:35:26.203Z","Nice looking set but not for playing with","<p>Overall, this set was fairly easy to build.&nbsp; The pieces come in separate plastic bags.</p>
<p>The engine is a HUGE disappointment.&nbsp; Even the most careful touch causes the front end to break apart.&nbsp; This isn't a problem with the rear wheels.&nbsp; Why the lego engineers/suits&nbsp;couldn't make the front wheels as stable as the rear wheels is a mystery.&nbsp; It makes one wonder if they even play with or test the sets before mass producing them?&nbsp; The engine fits nicely on Lego Thomas track but is so frail that it often falls apart&nbsp;or&nbsp;derails in the&nbsp;switches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 3&nbsp;train cars are&nbsp;solidly built but the wheels, which are not adjustable,&nbsp;just barely fit on&nbsp;Lego Thomas track.&nbsp; The fit could not be any tighter.&nbsp; There's&nbsp;zero margin for error.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any turn or&nbsp;switch in the track almost always causes the train to derail.</p>
<p>The magnetic couplers between the cars are&nbsp;are nice touch.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The engine does not fit under the Thomas Bridge and Tunnel Set (#65766).&nbsp; This frustrated my son so much that said he didn't want&nbsp;it and went back to playing with his Thomas characters.&nbsp; Raising the bridge by 1 1/2 or 2 bricks alleviates the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're buying this set to display on a shelf then it's fine.&nbsp; However, if you're buying this set to play with then you'll have to use some super glue to keep certain parts together.&nbsp; </p>

"sram","2011-07-29T11:35:15.37Z","Train with no stickers!","I finally got around to assembling my Western Train Chase. I have not seen the movie yet, so cannot relate to that part. Purchase the set when it goes on sale, I would not pay $80 for it.<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed putting the set together. The numbered bags really helped. The minifigures are excellent too. I typically do not go overboard on minifigs but in this case I was impressed with the level of detail and printing on the figures.<br><br>This is also the first train set I can remember that does not have STICKERS! It was pure ecstasy to put together a set that did not contain stickers. Not sure when is the last time I had that pleasure with any set (train or otherwise).<br><br>The engine has primary colours and it works pretty good. Nice to see basic colours used so effectively. I have not motorized it, but so far the train has held up pretty well. None of the stability problems cited by other reviewers. But then kids have not gotten hold of it yet!<br><br>Finally I found an Eurobricks member that had used PF functions to motorize the set, perhaps that maybe handy for anyone else looking to do the same:<br>http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=56308<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,3

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excellent detail.&nbsp; Easy build.&nbsp; Engine is durable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buy the set when on sale or clearance.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Way over priced.</p>
<p>Money Car is awkward.</p>
