<h4>Pros</h4>
<p>&nbsp;*Mini figures are Great! One Day I Realized This is The only set to Feature Strech &amp; Chunk, (Obviously!) <em>And</em> <strong>Clean Lotso</strong>! Which is a Plus!</p>
<p>*Awesome Dumper Piece for Construction Mocs!</p>
<p>* Dumping Feature Works well.</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p>*Strech Should Have come with Extra Happy Face.</p>
<p>*Chunks Legs Don't Move.</p>
<p>*$20 is A Bit Steep. But you Get What you Paid For!</p>

The dumping function works really well, and the back fits lotso perfectly. The mini figs you get here are great, the little orange guy has his changing face and somehow looks intimidating, and lotso and the octopus are neat also.</div><div><br></div><div>Cons: this set looks like a 15 dollar or even lower set, but it's 20 for some odd reason. Also there is no where to keep the octopus.</div><div><br></div><div>Still 5/5 because it's such a great addition to any collection!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,3
"peanut3197","2010-07-02T22:29:42.903Z","Good for 10 and under","<p>I recenly bought this set on sale, and went right home to build it with a friend. We are both experianced lego builders so the set took about 30-45 minutes. It was exciting to build, especially the device that lets the bed of the truck move. I also liked the minifigures, Lotso, Twitch, and Chunky. </p>
<p>The detail on the dump truck was really nice and it looked like the real dump truck from&nbsp; Toy Story 3. The playability is great and if you combine it with other Toy Story Lego Sets its even better.</p>
<p>I am glad to have the set because it is pretty cool, but if it had not been 25% off when I purchased it I probably would have passed because there are other much cooler sets like the Pizza Planet Truck to invest money in. Also the truck would have been much better if the builder (me) actually got to construct the bed rather than have a pre built plastic piece.</p>
<p>All in all the set was OK, a great Toy Story set for younger kids who still need a little practice with building techniques but want to build on their own.</p>

<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stretch's arms do not stay in place when posed (this really disappointed me),</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bags holding Chunk,Lotso,and Stretch's arms are very hard to open (Why&nbsp;not&nbsp; just use ordinary bags)?</li>

"David1971","2010-12-07T08:57:29.777Z","Extremely cute and very good value","<p>I see other reviews, from the USA, comment that this set is expensive. But to UK viewers, this is an amazing set for the RRP of £15. It is probably the best £15 set I have ever seen. And I'm sure it's still pretty wonderful for $20 in the US.</p><p>The dumper truck is really chunky and incredibly cute. It's a really nice, robust, boxy little truck; I think it looks fantastic. The build is well done and satisfying. AND you get THREE figures, or FOUR if you count the driver (which you probably do) - and they are all really nice cute ones, and each one very nicely done - so I think it's incredible value.</p><p>(The driver is, like, half a fig - the head is on a dome piece, so it's not a full minifig with legs. On the other hand Lotso is a big pink bear, and is like one-and-a-half figs! So that does add up to four).<br></p><p>Absolute full marks, 10 out of 10 to everything here.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"greshmalum","2011-02-11T11:44:19.767Z","ok....","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, the bad part is the dumping function. It was made in a way that makes the bed </p>
<p>hard to stick on all the way.</p>
<p>The Minifigs are okay. </p>
<p>They are bulky, but Chunk is cool. He has a smiley and an evil face. Lotso and Chunk's&nbsp;</p>
<p>arms move, but their legs don't.</p>
<p>Stretch Flex- She does not look at all like a girl. She looks like an old man.</p>
<p>The driver has the same piece as Stretch's head in dark blue for a body.</p>
<p>The cab seats normal minifigs as well, although it is a little tight.</p>
<p>However, I do like the color scheme-Lego needs to go back into the bright colors.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,3

Especially the yellow container on the rear of the truck. It is very not Lego.<br>I think it will be better if they replace it with some yellow bricks. Of course, the shape will be nicer using this one bulky bed, but I think it really ruins the spirit of Lego.<br><br>Other than the minifigs, there's no other interesting for this set. Just a so-so set.<br><br>If you are a true Toys Story lovers, then this set is definitely a must-to-have, cause the minifigs inside it is unique and can not be found in other sets, but if you search for a set to build, then you better skip this one.<br>",TRUE,3,2,2,4,3

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-15T10:46:45.87Z","Welcome to Sunnyside!","<p>Set #7789 Lotso's Dump Truck: As soon as I finished building this set that's the first thing that came out of my mouth, and I'm a 28 year old AFOL. LOL</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a solid looking vehicle from the Toy Story Theme, it looks great and it stands out as a LEGO version of a toy dump truck, so that's a plus, there is however some concern with the large yellow piece for the rear of the truck. It is all one piece as others have noted and that may dissapoint some LEGO enthusiasts. I wasn't too dissapointed, but I scored the parts honestly taking that into consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dumping mechanism works very well too. This is the only set to feature three characters from the movie in Mini-Figure and Mini-Figure-like form. (Since some don't consider them to be true Mini-Figures.) There is the Octopus Stretch, he is made up of two pieces, the base with rubbery octopus legs that don't pose, and a purple dome with his face printed on. The face looks mean or serious, this toy isn't haveing any fun today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lotso of course is included, using a lightsaber blade in brown (Harry Potter magic wands.) as a cane, he is clean, with no dirt markings printed on his body representing the way he looked at the beginning of the film before Woody and the gang got him Trashed. (Snickers.) And finally we have Flex, a single piece Mini-Figure with a roller face that shows happy or angry, it's really a clever looking little figure and LEGO did a great job making the feature of the toy in the movie into a LEGO Mini-Figure sized body. (Although he is a smidge shorter than other Mini-Figures, as my Green Army Men can attest to when put side by side with him.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A fourth pseudo Mini-Figure exists, a dome is used for the torso of the dump truck driver with a Mini-Figure head, the face printing seems to indicate that he has an open mouth in an O shape. He is also wearing a yellow construction hat, but I don't really consider him to be a Mini-Figure, he's just part of the truck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to admit that this set is a great looking set and a worthy addition to the Toy Story Theme. I picked it up at 50% off from Wal-Mart, so I only paid half the price for it, which bumps the value for money rating up one. At full price this set is still ok, but I couldn't see myself paying that high a price for just the Mini-Figures alone. I mean the dump truck is great, with a working dumping mechanism and a solid look to it, but it is fairly standard looking. Still it is a great looking set and I'm glad I picked it up. Now to scrimp and save to get more Toy Story sets before they vanish completely... But unlike Prince of Persia I have a feeling that LEGO Toy Story will be around for a considerably longer time even if LEGO isn't making any new sets this year for the Theme because Toy Story is an iconic and much beloved franchise. It's just a shame they couldn't make Bo Peep or Mr and Mrs. Potato Head in Mini-Figure form, or even Slinky Dog... Hmmm I wonder why Slinky wasn't made into a Mini-Figure type form?</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4

His is pink and white and clean, unlike his version with the claw set.<br></p><p>* Clunk: Clunk is an interesting minifigure, because he has legs that don´t move, and his face is on a roller so you can make him look good or evil.<br></p><p>* Stretch: Stretch has a new element as well, his 8 tentacles. They are stretchy and are made from rubber. <br></p><p>* Truck Driver:He is not really a minifigure. He has no legs, but he has a head and a construction helment.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>The Build:</h4><p>The Build itself only takes about 20 mins, but when it is finished it 
looks great. All the minifigures fit on the truck, and the the finished 
model looks great, because it is movie accurate. Also included in the 
set are 3 LEGO 2x2 Bricks so you can use it as a dump truck instead of a
 transport option if you want. The build has a good selection of parts. The new tip truck piece is good, although it often falls of the set because of poor attachment. Also included in the set are 3 LEGO 2x2 Bricks so you can use it as a dump truck instead of a transport option if you want. The tip truck actually tips unlike other LEGO Truck sets that we have seen, so that´s a bonus as well.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Pros:</h4><p>* Unique Figures.</p><p>* Unique elements<br></p><p>* Dump truck that tips.</p><p>* You can recreate a movie scene.</p><p>* The set is movie accurate.<br></p><h4>Cons:</h4><p>* Skip piece falls off.</p><p>* Should have Buzz &amp; Woody.</p><p>* Clunk´s legs should bend.<br></p><h4>&nbsp;</h4><h4>Conclusion:</h4><p>All in all it is a neat little set, worth getting to enlarge your Toy Story Collection. 5/5 <br></p><p>LEGOSLUG</p><p>P.S.
