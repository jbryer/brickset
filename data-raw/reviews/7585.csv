"Duq","2010-08-02T19:00:32.787Z","It's Shaun the sheep and the big bad wolf!","Obviously this set is not about the building experience. The 14 pieces it takes to build Shaun and his cousins don't take long to put together. As a parts pack it's probably not much use, unless you're after 2x2 white bricks and tiles or 1x1 round plates with a hole.<br><br>The good news: once you've built the four sheep and the wolf you've got a fun game on the table. In short you need your sheep to grow wool and then shear it. Who ever has the most wool (2x2 bricks) at the end of the game wins. Simple. Before you can harvest your wool someone else can take your sheep, or send the wolf over to you, causing you to loose your wool, depending on the colours on that brilliant die.<br><br>For the 12 euro we paid we had a lot of fun playing this with the children. <br>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"cloud0","2010-10-26T23:41:08.043Z","A game for kids","<p>Managed to pick up this little set at 1/2 price($10) in one of the local toy shops. Think it could have been a pricing error?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Built</strong></p>
<p>Anyway like many before me have mentioned, there is hardly much of a build here; it's simply just putting pieces together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective is to &quot;harvest&quot; as many wool from the sheep as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very simplistic game mainly targetted at children ages 6-10. The basic idea is with the roll of a dice, the player decides whether with the outcome of the die to add more wool to their current sheep, steal other people's wool with the wolf or simply harvest the wool on their own sheep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too much of a chance game to be really enjoyable. But at least the sheep and wolf are cute!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>A cute little game which is easy to understand for kids, but really kinda boring to adults. Get it if the look of the sheeps and wolf amuse you. Not much use for parts anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My review is a little biased on the pricing as I got it at&nbsp;half-price, otherwise I believe I might pass.</p>

"TooMuchLEGO","2011-02-22T18:13:00.88Z","Hours upon Hours of fun","How I love this game! Any age will love it- from little 4 year olds like my sister to 40 year olds like my dad. This game never gets boring. Never.<div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div>The build for this game is quite easy, but it's a lot of fun too. As some have noticed, these sheep bear&nbsp;resemblance&nbsp;to the Shawn the Sheep ones, making them look quite cute. The big bad wolf is cool too- he looks scary... and hungry...watch out sheep. ;-)</div><div><br></div><h4>The&nbsp;Game Play</h4><div>The game play is quite simple- collect wool, sheer, have the most wool, and watch out for the big bad wolf. Thankfully the rules are easy to understand by anyone- my little sis can play like a pro. Due to this, the game can go by pretty quickly, so you can play a lot of rounds in a small amount of time.</div><div><br></div><h4>Box</h4><div>The box shows two farmers playing against each other on a table in a ranch, with some sheep frolicking in the background. It also shows the big bad wolf looking pretty scary, scaring the wool off of a sheep! Not to mention, Wild Wool happens to be LIMITED EDITION- meaning it's extra cool!</div><div><br></div><div>Overall this game is a lot of fun, and anyone will love it. Even when you're not playing the actual game it can be fun- some little kids I know often take the big bad wolf and go on a sheep sheering rampage. :) Anyway, this game is probably one of the best games in the LEGO GAMES theme, and for a mere price of $9.99, you've got a lot of fun on your hands.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Purno","2012-01-23T03:16:40.66Z","Humorous sheep in a fun game","<p>Got this as a present and playtested it with friends;<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Comes with a hard box like all games. Unfortunately both the building instructions and the game rules are folded in the box. If the box would've been a few millimeters bigger, the books would fit in unfolded. <br></p><p>Instructions are rather simple.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Half of the set exists out of relatively boring white 2x2 bricks, but I found some of the other parts quite useful. Shame the set doesn't come with any spare tiles for the dice, so changing the game rules is quite limited. <br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The sheep look extremely funny which always gives me good laugh. They can turn their heads up and down, though that functionality is not part of the gameplay. The wolf can wiggle his tail up and down. <br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>Building four of the same sheep is a tad boring, but unavoidable. The smaller parts are a tad annoying to fit on the bricks well, but nothing an AFOL can't handle (not sure about kids though)<h4>The completed model</h4><p>So far, this is the first game I see which has simple rules everyone understands within minutes. Most other LEGO games seem to have game rules which are more difficult to understand and I usually have to read the lines a few times over. (Could be the translation perhaps). But not this game; it's simple and extremely fun. <br></p><p><br></p><p>We played it with 3 adult players and choices sometimes were quite limited (there often was 1 best thing to do, so it's quite predictable what another player will do). The box states the game is for 2 to 4 players, but I doubt the game is fun with only 2 players, as it limits the choices even more. I think this game is more fun with more players, or perhaps even more sheep per player. (Unfortunately, the game doesn't provide enough sheep for that). Might want to pick up another Shave a Sheep to further expand the possibilities; more sheep, more players, more wool and more tiles to change the dice. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The best game I've played so far. Simple yet entertaining. The sheep look humorous. The set is a tad limiting though, but the game can easily be expanded by buying a second box.<br></p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5
"Tim_Johnson","2012-05-31T10:09:10.66Z","About the parts and quantities","As everyone has said, this is a fun and very cute game for all ages. This review is about the pieces.<div><br></div><div>At RRP it is not good value per piece, but I'm seeing it discounted everywhere at the moment - including S@H right now, so piece value is good.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The 24 white 2x2 bricks drag down the overall piece value, but the good news is there are 12 white 1x1 round plates with holes which is an incredibly useful piece. Only Kokoriko has more (16). At time of writing, this piece appears only in Games and Store Opening sets. Hopefully we'll see it in colours other than white soon, and also in 'proper' sets at some point.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The white 2x2 tile with ""x2"" pattern is unique to this set, but would be of limited use in MOCs. Probably good for inventing your own games though. Creationary has an orange one.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You get 8 black 1x4 bricks with studs on one side, and 8 white 2x2 tiles. These are good quantities for a small set and decent piece value even if you pay RRP for the set. Likewise with the bright pink 1x2 tiles, but there's only 2 in a set.</div><div><br></div><div>There are no baseplates / large plates.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,3,1,5,4
