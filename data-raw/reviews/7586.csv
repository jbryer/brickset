"ogel3001","2012-12-10T17:25:50.55Z","A fun game for its size.","<p>The race is on to transport energy modules back to Earth on special rockets. Collect enough energy modules and launch your rocket ship and win! But beware of the unpredictable aliens and their UFO: you never know whether they will help or hinder your mission.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice flying saucer on the top<br></li><li>Alien Micro-fig</li><li>""Building the rocket"" idea is fun<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The Alien Micro-fig is not in the standard rules.</li><li>The UFO breaks off.</li><li>Putting the energy modules back on the rock/mountain is tedious<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall I'd recommend this game because the idea is very good and in my opinion it's one of the best smaller games.&nbsp; <br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,5
