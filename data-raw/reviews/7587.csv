"AZFIREWOLF","2010-08-11T08:36:31.58Z","Not a great set, but a baseplate is cool","<p>Saw this set yesterday and bought it for only 2 reasons. The ""blood orange"" base plate and the brown monster. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the set is not a great parts buy, however since the game is designed for children I am sure that kids will get a little bit ofplay out of it and then forget the game. </p>
<p>I predict that this game is going to be in our lives for only a few months and then it will be gone. However I do see a number of people buying this for their bricklink stores. </p>

    <li>Cool monster.</li>

"LStyer","2011-04-30T01:11:29.043Z","Neat little parts pack.","<p>Let me admit right up front that I don't actually play the LEGO board 
games, but even so I think this set is worth picking up.<br></p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Magma Monster</span> game comes in what appears to be the standard LEGO game box.&nbsp; It's sturdy and the completed game board will fit inside.&nbsp; Even if you don't build and keep the game, I like these boxes for brick storage and sorting.</p><p>Two sets of instructions are included, one for the build and one for game play.&nbsp; The build instructions were clear enough for what was a pretty simple build.&nbsp; As I mentioned above, I didn't play the game, but I did read through the game rules, and at least the path-building portion sounds pretty neat.&nbsp; The ""combat"" element didn't do much for me on the read-through, but I haven't played the game, and actual play experience might redeem it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I bought this set for the parts, so I rated it high on that front.&nbsp; This was my first orange base plate, and I'm not aware of any other current sets that include one.&nbsp; Several of the pieces that make up the Magma Monster, himself, are, if not unique to this set, at least uncommon in the colors found here.&nbsp; I've become a bit of a fan of the ""log"" bricks lately, and this set includes ten 1x2 bricks in each of brown, light gray and sand.</p><p>A 1 x 4 modified brick with groove, several gouts of flame, a gold ""nugget,""&nbsp; a couple transparent bricks, two bats, some back plates and some gray and brown sloped bricks round out the set.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The four included microfigures are decorated to look like modern-day adventurers.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Even though I didn't intend to play the game, I went ahead and built the board.&nbsp; There isn't a whole lot here to build, but what there is makes for a fun building experience.&nbsp;  In setting up the game board you 
build a couple neat little rock outcroppings, and it's fun to ""watch"" the Magma Monster, 
itself, come together.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This is less a model, of course, than a game board, and cleared as if for a new game, the baseplate looks pretty barren.&nbsp; Even then, though, the back end of the board, with the Magma Monster, his cave, and his bat cohorts looks pretty neat.&nbsp; Even after disassembling the game, I kept the Magma Monster assembled, figuring he can terrorize my <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Castle</span> minifigs.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I picked this set up for about $10 at Wal-Mart, and at that price I felt
 it was a good value, but apparently the MSRP is $14.99.&nbsp; I'm not sure I
 would have even made the purchase at that price.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4
