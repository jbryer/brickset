The chest pieces are a sweatshirt pattern for the male and an orange blouse with a flower on the right of the torso for the female. The new girl face is a smile. They brought back old window shutters that are similar to the ones in the Harry Potter Shrieking Shack but were made to fit the new window fames. It also has a pizza piece which was rare back in the Early 2000s but you can get it in the Community Workers and City Corner sets and yes this one too. I CAN'T WAIT TILL IT COMES OUT FOR AMERICA.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
