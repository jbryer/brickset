For a Happy Meal set, I think that this is one of the best. The overall design of the plane works as does the color scheme. If this was released now I would have to buy more than 1 of these sets so that I can add to my pink brick collection. I wish LEGO would go back to supplying McDonald's with regular non-Bionicle sets for Happy Meal promotions.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
