The 2 x 3 brick.&nbsp;This brick&nbsp;has been available for ordinary Lego&nbsp;builders for decades but until now sorely missed&nbsp;by Duplo builders. Finally, Lego&nbsp;has produced this brick and it is now available in a few of the 2010 (and 2011) sets.<br/>So if you want the 2 x 3&nbsp;brick then the 5507 set is a&nbsp;good way to get it&nbsp;as it contains a total of&nbsp;six of them. Four red ones and two yellow ones.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>As for the other bricks in the set, they are quite an ordinary collection. The inventory is like so many other Duplo brick boxes released over the years. A lot of 2 x 2 bricks and very few of the&nbsp;larger bricks that you always have too few of (a&nbsp;single 2 x 6 brick is the largest brick in the set).<br/>The set comes with a very convenient plastic box&nbsp;that is great for brick storage. It also contains a green&nbsp;8 x 16 plate which is a great foundation or roof for your constructions.&nbsp;And it&nbsp;comes with two figures to use with the car and house that Lego suggests that you can build.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>So,&nbsp;nothing out of the ordinary apart from the 2 x 3 bricks. If you want Duplo 2 x 3 bricks this is the way to get a basic collection of them. If you just want a set of Duplo bricks for your kids then&nbsp;this set is no worse or better then&nbsp;any of the other Lego Duplo boxes available.<br/>&nbsp;",TRUE,4,4,5,4,3

The 102 pieces are enough for a complex 2-floor house including a balcony and a car.</p><p><br></p><p>The big piece is safe for kid under 3. Also as the kid grows up the big pieces could be used in later Lego building, like a town or a city.</p><p><br></p><p>I am sure this set will live at the bottom of my son's heart, even after he gets hundreds of Lego sets.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
