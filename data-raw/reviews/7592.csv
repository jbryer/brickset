If I had to find something to criticize it would be that the wrench doesn't really have any purpose and it's way out of scale.&nbsp; Also, the minifig is the same as contained in at least one other set, the Stone Quarry.&nbsp; This dump truck is a nice complement to the Quarry as it's a pretty sizeable truck and holds alot of bricks.&nbsp; My toddler really likes the little traffic cone included as well.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
