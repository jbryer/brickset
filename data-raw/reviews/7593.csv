I was searching for the Traveler set and the BBQ stand set (the name escapes me) but found this instead! It has a cool little farmer who matches the farmer that came with my Tractor set. It also has a dog (MY FIRST DOG!) and a cool new pig! The little food trough is cool and I like the blue bucket thing... not sure what it's called. You can't really have cons or ways to improve the set because it's so small. For some reason it was listed as $5.49 at Toys 'R' Us so it was a little overpriced but oh well! Well worth it! I highly reccommend it.",FALSE,5,5,3,5,4
"alva","2011-02-25T06:52:08.09Z","Best Impulse","What I love about the set is that it comes with lot of amazing parts. You got a minifig, with extra two animals (the pig and the dog). So each should only cost you around USD 1. Try to search the animals in the bricklink, and they cost around USD 2. So if you want to build a farm or a kennel, and need a lot of dogs or pigs, you should buy the set as many as you could find.<br>",TRUE,5,5,1,1,5
"BobaFett2","2011-01-12T17:49:40.343Z","A quaint little City set that makes it easier to get pigs.","<p>I bought this at the LEGO store. I think you can guess why.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box isn't extremely impressive, but neither is it bare. The image shows a little scene, with some fields and the outline of a city in the distant.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set only comes with 16 parts, yet it costs 4 dollars. It's not a great price-but some parts make it worth it. The set contains a pig and a dog, which are both very nice pieces. The dog does have a bit of trouble fitting onto plates, but is otherwise great. The pig is just plain awesome. The feed bucket is the only scenery in the set. It may be minimal, but it's effective, with a bit of shade for the food, some pig slop on the ground, and some water/food in a bucket.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The set includes a farmer minifigure. The torso has some great details, although the face is a bit too happy for my liking. Farmers aren't that happy people. He could have had a better hat, too. Farmer hats are meant for protection from the sun, not just style.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's easy. Boring.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Simple-as said above. It is small though....but it could be better.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I highly recommend getting just one of these sets before they disappear from stores. You will be getting two animals, as well as a blue bucket and a red roof piece. Other parts are pretty inconsequential, but it's better than nothing.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,2,3,4
"AETerry","2010-11-01T12:03:31.06Z","Bring on the Bacon!","<p>Okay, I'm propably one of many or a few? Who didn't just settle for one of these sets, but picked up 3. Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pig and the dog pieces. I don't have a lot of farm sets, not many of them truely appeal to me for set ups, other then the pigs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a farmer with a shovel. Black cap that's a different design from older models of caps. A dog and pig and this set makes it easy to get both of them for a Lego collection. And something you don't see often, is that little blue ""open pack"". </p>

<p>It's well worth it getting this set for the animals if you don't have them or want a way to get them easilly.</p>

"clundsberg","2010-10-26T01:51:22.46Z","Old MacDonald had a...","There's not a lot of farm sets out there but it's nice that Lego put out this mini set allowing kids/collectors an opportunity to get a nice Farmer figure along with a Dog and Pig.&nbsp; I think this is the first pig in my...er...my son's Lego armada.&nbsp; Dogs seem to be a bit easier to come by as pets or police sets, but pigs?&nbsp; Notsomuch.<br/>There are also rare colour legos in this set, albiet they are small pieces, but still the rare light green colour adds to the sets diversity.<br/>These sets are around $5 so as I stated with the Jester, it makes a nice reward/gift if you have some spare change.<br/>Playability:&nbsp; Aside from the dog, pig and farmer which is like having 3 figures in a way, the farmer weilds a shovel for scooping up what I assume is pig slop that can be placed in the troff or the bucket conveniantly located to the side of said troff.&nbsp; A lot of work can be done for such a smal set!<br/>I'd like to note that this is the first set my son was excited about building so fast that he proceeded to take it apart the minute he finished it to put it back together again sans instructions.&nbsp; In a place where people often write reviews based on being older it's refreshing to see a child's point of view.&nbsp; Sure it's still easy for him to build, but it doesn't take away or warrant a demerit in my book.&nbsp; It just gives it a new perspective.<br/>This is a nice small set for a faction of lego that doesn't get the glamour on the shelves that science fiction sets tend to get.&nbsp; Worth the purchase if you come across it.",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-28T12:56:15.327Z","Wee, Wee, Wee, all the way Home","<p>Set #7566 Farmer: Perhaps this set should be called Pig Farmer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as Impulse sets go as soon as I learned of it I wanted it, for the pig alone, this set is well worth it. You get the Pig, a Dog, a Mini-Figure and a little troff to feed the Pig.</p>
<p>Really you're not building much, but as always this is an Impulse set, so it can be forgiven for offering up such a small build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven't gotten this little guy yet then I have to ask, what are you waiting for? The Farmer is worth the price of admission, it's cheap, it's fun and it gives you a pig. I'd say if you wanted to make an army of Pigs for the new Pig Farm set then picking up a lot of these would definitely help. Oink, Oink. ;)</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"coldcomfort","2011-01-10T02:22:19.447Z","7566 Farmer - A deal you can't refuse.","First of all, I have to point out that my ratings of sets are subjective
 based on what I believe the overall intent of the set to be. For 
example, my expectations of $100 USD+ major sets are much higher and 
more detailed than my expectations for middle price point and 
inexpensive impulse sets. With that in mind, my view towards sets like 
these is that they are marketed to provide Lego enthusiasts with an 
inexpensive avenue of adding 1) minifigures, 2) minifigure accessories, 
and 3) an assortment of basic bricks and elements to their collections. I
 also keep my expectations of the building experience in context. We're 
only buying a minifigure here, after all. We can't honestly expect a 
challenge. I keep only those criteria in mind when reviewing sets like 
this one.<br><br>This set is an obvious winner as it gives you a farm related minifigure (although he can just as easily be an everyday City dweller if you just take the shovel out of his hand), a dog AND a pig. Add the few bricks and elements and you've got a kit that's darned near a give away.<br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Farm hand minifigure will add some depth to your collection.<br></li><li>The accessories in this set are fantastic. A shovel, a dog AND a pig are a lot more than I've seen in some older sets.<br></li><li>This kit is a great value. I got mine from the Lego website where it was market down to $1.98! I only got one, but now I wish I would've snapped up half a dozen.</li><li>Includes two tan 1x2 bricks and a tan 2x4 plate, a color you don't see frequently in sets.<br></li></ul>
<p>This is a really cool kit that will add both a useful minifigure and a couple of animals to your collection. If you like the Farm sub theme this set is definitely for you. Even if you don't, the minifigure will look right at home in any City display and is well worth the cost of this set all on its own. Buy one or two while they're still very easy to get. You won't be sorry.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"United_Bricks","2011-09-04T12:36:16.663Z","The pig","This set is one of the smallest sets in the lego city farm line, it costed £2.99. The set is nice I would get multiplys just for the pig.<br>The minifigure is a farmer with a black cap which is diffrent to the old caps, because the new one goes slightly up and the old one is just straight. His face is like the normal city face except he has a bigger smile. His torso is red but has green overalls printed on it. Finerlly his legs are just plain green.<br>You get one brown dog, I would of liked it if you got a grey dog like you got in the old harry potter night bus or lego made a new black and white dog. You also get a pig which is kind of rare, you can also get a pig in the harry potter burrow. The pig is pinky-orange with two black eyes. Finerlly the pig troff is bad you get two lime green studs and a red stud, you get a blue bucket.<br>Overall I would just get this set for the pig. <br>",TRUE,4,3,2,2,3

It's made up of very basic pieces and there's not much to build. But that's okay, it still looks very nice and has the right feel to it which is all that matters.

"welociraptor_28","2019-04-22T13:01:55.397Z","Farm sets are the best","<p>My parents bought this set for me a long time ago, and I finally see how good it is!</p>

<h3>Box and instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes in a very small box with the typical city design. Instructions are extremely small and don&#39;t have any pages.</p>

<h3>Building experience</h3>

<p>There is not much to talk about, you can build this set in under a minute, first time, without looking at the instructions. Despite this, it is enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The only interesting parts in this set is the old style of a dog, a pig and 3 tan or brick yellow pieces. This color is not that common in city sets so it&#39;s nice to get it even in a small amount.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In this set you can find only one minifigure, a male farmer. He has common green pants, red farmer shirt, a common happy face and a black hat. His accessory is a dark gray shovel. He isn&#39;t very interesting, but it&#39;s nice to get more farmers.</p>

<h3>Complete model</h3>

<p>The set consists of a dog, a pig, a minifigure and a pigpen. If you have a farm, this sets perfectly blends in with everything. You can deconstruct the pigpen to get the parts.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Thanks to the amount of things in this set, there is a lot of potential for play.</p>

<h3>Value for money</h3>

<p>You get a lot of things for a low price, it&#39;s so cheap!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This set is one of the only farm sets from lego city and it&#39;s excellent. You get a lot of thing for a small price and you get that farm feeling.</p>
