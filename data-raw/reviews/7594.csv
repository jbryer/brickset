"krysto2002","2010-06-06T13:06:36.45Z","I smell a trend","First let me explain the title. Anyone who's seen/built the Typhoon Turbo Sub from Atlantis or any of the old Alpha team 3 models might have noticed a growing trend in transforming ships. This set in particular has a similar design concept to the Typhoon sub, but with some major differences that make it unique.<br><br><h4>Contents</h4>One Undercover Cruiser<br>One Alien spaceship<br>One Space Police Commando<br>One Alien, Jawson<br>Two pairs handcuffs (one presumably extra)<br><br><h4>Breakdown</h4>The undercover cruiser is obviously the highlight of the set, but on its own holds a few flaws. The cruiser measures about a foot long, over 8'' wide and 4'' tall but shrinks to 9'' long, 8'' wide and 3.5'' tall when ""undercover"".<br>At first impression, the thought was, ""how on earth can that be undercover, it's blatantly obvious that it's a police craft"", but when the set was finally revealed, it's true function was surprisingly fun. Like the rotating Typhoon sub, the Undercover Cruiser uses a few well-place technic gears to provide a simple, yet effective rotating mechanism.<br><br>The ship's cockpit folds back and hooks into the main body of the ship and flips over to reveal cargo ship markings (the logo used in the current cargo theme) the only giveaway being the Commando sitting (standing actually) in the cockpit. The only setbacks here:<br>1) There are few places to grasp the ship by to do this<br>2) The rear piece (used to hold the ship in its form while undercover) has a habit of coming off sometimes taking the 2X2 slope holding it in place with it.<br>3) That same rear piece also doesn't always hold the ship in Undercover mode, as it sometimes slips out, though for the most part, it stays together.<br>4) The decorative pieces on the side of the cockpit also have a habit of falling off<br><br>The ship wields 6 small lasers, 1 large cone (presumably a laser) and two flick fire missiles, but the story with them remains the same (BTW this is first time I've ever actually gotten a missile to launch on my first flick).<br><br>Unfortunately, there is no clever use of a prison pod as storage, so there is no place for Jawson, the criminal henchman. The 2010 wave brings the alien count to 12 different criminals, with only 8 pods to hold them in.<br><br>The cruiser is also very front heavy and tips backwards, but in an amazing twist of design, the rear piece also doubles as landing gear.<br><br>Lastly, the cruiser holds a total of 13 stickers, a small problem, but at least most of them are easy to apply.<br><br><h4>Jawson's Craft<br></h4><p>Surprisingly large for a mini-ship, Jawson's little cruiser measures up to be 7.5'' long (5.5'' w/o flame), 3.5'' wide and 1.5'' tall. It has folding wings and is armed with 2 cannons and a pair of flick fire missiles, same story as above. For such a small craft, it is surprisingly sturdy.</p><p><br></p><h4> Minifigures</h4><br>This set includes 2 figures, a commando and an Alien called Jawson.<br><br>Commando, typical SP3 commando, currently available in 5 sets however, each one has a different head. This one looks very similar to the previous two, however his head is only one-sided. The helmet is good for MoCs and finally brings back the long-lost trans red visors, last seen in 1990. Quite frankly, they look great. The torso and legs are the same old SP3 design.<br><br>Jawson however, is brand new and is available in EVERY one of the new SP3 sets. He wears a tattered orange jumpsuit (similar to exo-force), the torso of which isn't very detailed, the reason for which is his head, which covers most of the shirt anyways. Speaking of which, Jawson's head will be a welcome addition to our alien hordes. His head wraps entirely around the torso, front to back and is well painted. Unfortunately, it isn't of the highest quality, so you can easily see the seam, which splits his head down the middle. The head is a nice stone gray with tan spikes down the back, his jaw for which he is named is long and has a slot for any standard bar (lightsaber width).<br><h4>Summary</h4>Pros:<br><ul><li>2 cool minifigures</li><li>Cruiser is large</li><li>nicely designed and visually pleasing</li><li>loads of plability</li><li>handcuff accessories</li><li>decent sized mini craft</li><li>Undercover mode works well</li><li>decent spare parts</li><li>has landing gear<br></li></ul>Cons:<br><ul><li>Back piece falls off occasionally</li><li>flick fire missiles</li><li>stickers, but not too many</li><li>nowhere to put handcuffs</li><li>no prison pod</li><li>too front heavy</li><li>some parts flimsy</li></ul><h4>Last Words</h4>Overall, at $30, this is a good buy, you get the new figure, Jawson and a nice ship to add to the SP3 fleet, but for $10 more, you can get the Lunar Limo, with an extra figure and probably a better buy in the long run. But for a Space Police set, this does not disappoint.<br>I'd give it an overall 4.1/5 or an 8/10.<br><br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"P13c30fch33s3","2010-06-11T00:43:05.047Z","How is this 'Undercover'?...Oh","FIrst of all, I should explain that very early prelim images featured very blurry pictures of this set. Because it was so blurry, you could not see the smal box showing the 'undercover' mode. However, when clearer pictures emerged, it's key function was shown to be rather ingenious.<br><br><h4>The Minifigs</h4><p>There are two minifigs in this set: SP Commando, and Jawson. The SP commando is like any of the other commandos, albeit without airtanks and witha&nbsp; different face. Either way, the helmet is an excellent piece and can be used to customise minifigs. Jawson is extremely good, not because of his torso or legs (which are average) but the headpiece. His head goes down, almost to the bottom of the torso. There are four beige fins, which get progressively smaler down his spine. The face itself is actualy rather low, compared to other minifig's faces, but is excellent. The gap between his top and bottom jaws are large enough to fit a lightsabre blade width piece inside. He has two buck teethe on his bottom jaw, but has three teeth on his top jaw. Overall, the minifigs are excellent in this set.</p><p><br></p><h4>Jawson's ""Creeper""</h4><p>I have no idea why Jawson's craft is called a 'creeper' and i only called it that because that is what it is called according to the SP Bios. Either way, it is a very long craft, wth the large flame piece on the back. The two flickfire holders are held by a clip, and have no pieces to keep it straight, so occasionally bend forward when fired. The two jets on the side add the effect of appearing very fast. The two front guns appear two imbalance this craft, as they are very long. It looks fairly menacing and would probably cause civilians to move out of the way...however they do at the time of SPIII.</p><p><br></p><h4>Undercover Cruiser</h4>This is the main focus of the set. The Undercover Cruiser is fairly large, although in standard mode is very unbalanced.This is fixed by bending the rear part back as far as possible. This allows the Undercover Cruiser to land without falling backwards much. This also has the effect of having the two antennae stick up in the air. While the two wing like parts on the sides of the cockpit have eight transparent green cones (altogether), there are only two flickfire missiles. The six cones on the bottom aren't connected to flickfire missiles. This is easily solved with six spare flickfire missiles because there is space on the underside for the sticks of the flickfire missiles. At the front, there is a large grey cone with a green cone on the end of it. It appears to be a heavy laser cannon. The tw3o wings on the sides of the engines are rather small, when compared to the size of the rest of the craft. When in undercover mode, the police lights (red and blue) are all concealed (because they all face up in normal mode), the weaponry is also concealed (they all point backwards) and everything that says 'police' (or has the SPIII symbol) on it flips under to conceal the word 'police'. To add to the undercover mode, it also has green markings, and has the Lego Cargo Transport logo on it. The only giveaways in undercover mode are:<br><ul><li>If you go underneath the undercover cruiser, you will see all the lights and the word 'police'</li><li>You ca see the SP Commando in the cockpit.</li></ul>However, in undercover mode, you cannot land it properly because of some of the lights sticking out of the bottom. So far as I can see, there are very few flaws with it, but there are some:<br><ul><li>In either mode, the Undercover Cruiser does not land properly</li><li>The SP Commando, unlike any other SP Commando set, has no airtanks (there is no space for it)</li><li>There is a small portion of the Undercover Cruiser that is hollow, and shows all the way through (it is just above the big cannon)</li></ul><h4>Bottom Line</h4><p>This set is great value. I recommend you get it, especially over a lot of the (overpriced, as usual) Star Wars sets.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"dim","2010-11-04T12:06:30.393Z","Hidden delights","<p>This is my favorite Space Police III set; it incorporates surprising aesthetics and a very cool, unusual transformation function.</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures:<br/></strong>The set includes two minifigures, a space policeman with the new red visor helmet and Jawson, a space crook, who appears to just have broken out of ‘astro-jail’.&nbsp; The new policeman's helmet seems a bit unproportionally large and his uniform is the same print as in 2009 sets. However the red visor is an obvious and welcome reference to the Space Police I colours of 1989. Jawson is a very entertaining and unique figure; His head is an unusual cast with a lot of detailing and excellent colouring.&nbsp; He even has the print of a filer sticking conspicuously out of his pocket and smudged serial numbers and barcodes. </p>
<ul>
<li></li></ul>
<p><strong>Jawson's Creeker:<br/></strong>Jawson's little flyer is nothing special, but its design is slightly reminiscent of older, small open Lego Space flyers from the 80's. The wings are hinged and if tilted all the way down, the Creeker transforms into some sort of a futuristic sledge. There are two flick-fire missiles mounted on the wings, which they never work as well as the larger spring loaded shooters. </p>
<ul>
<li></li></ul>
<p><strong>The Undercover Cruiser:<br/></strong>The main focus of the set is a one-man fighter with unique design. The pilot sits under a bulbous, transparent canopy and in front of him stretches a long nose from the tip of which hangs an engine module with four turbines and additional winglets. The scheme reminds of a futuristic chariot with the heavy engine module dragging the suspended body. It’s a very inspired and intimidating design which I could easily imagine in a sci-fi movie (and there it would attract a lot of attention). Certainly this spaceship is heavily armed even though the actual firing modules are only two lame flick-fire missiles. </p>
<p>However the highlight of the set is the amazing transformation feature; the vessel is articulated, made of three parts which can bend until the cockpit reaches roughly the underside. Thus the Undercover Cruiser turns upside down and&nbsp;transforms into a freighter spaceship, with the colours and badges known from the City Transport sets (like e.g. the 7992 Container Stacker). Funnily enough the ship in its undercover mode looks a bit slow in comparison to the dynamic look of the Police mode, which is exactly what one should expect. The most impressive part of the transformation is undoubtedly the simultaneous (and automatic) twisting of the wings with the use of a simple, yet ingenious gear system. </p>
<p>There are only a&nbsp;few disadvantages here; for example, in order for the Undercover Cruiser to land, one must tilt the aft section of the spaceship all the way down, but even then the vehicle remains slightly off balance, which is not critical but noticeable. Also the cockpit is very cramped and when in Police mode the pilot looks awkwardly up the sky instead of looking in front. Surprisingly, when in undercover mode -as the pictures reveal- the pilot is facing properly, as the cockpit has in this case a strong inclination. More annoying is the complete lack of controls. Of course it’s the future blah, blah, and cybernetic drive blah, blah, but if there were some space, I believe one would want to see some controls there. Also the set comes with two pairs of handcuffs but there is no space for them either. <br/><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summing up</strong>, I don’t think that there is a more innovative set in the entire Space Police III series. It may lack the trademark feature of the prison pods with the shooting targets, but the transformation feature and the sleek design –more than- make up for this. Plus, I believe, the price is right; this is the cheapest of the three last SP III sets and yet in many ways the most interesting.<br/></p>

"AETerry","2010-12-29T12:19:16.76Z","Undercover Cruiser Review","<p>My first response to seeing any of the Space Police 3 series was WOW!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After picking up this set, I am further WOWed by the design and build. The simple elegance to which the Space Police ship transforms from&nbsp;Cargo Ship to Cruiser is awesome. It is a very solid, engaging build that doesn't create a flimsy ship. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's very creative and clever on LEGO's part with the set, sleek build with constrasting black and white&nbsp;color that works. If this is a direction that LEGO is looking to go, I hope it doesn't get over done like the flick weapons many of these vehicles are coming out with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other vehicle in this set is Jawson's little starship. It too is a solid little design with forward mounted laser cannons and side wings that fold. It's not bad, it needs just a little more oomph to it. The alien Jawsom himself is a good minifigure. Many of the aliens designed for Space Police 3 have been well done and creates more variety for LEGO Space. My complaint over all is using humans for the good guys and Aliens/Monsters for the badguys which is too one-sided or stereotypical.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5
"Daniel_Valkenburg","2010-10-04T13:19:32.65Z","Not bad","The Undercover Cruiser is a nice set, combining the technology to transform from bulk-cruiser to chase-ship with nice esthetiques. It is good value for money like all space police sets in this series. Furthermore the alien minifig is very nice looking.",FALSE,4,4,4,4,4
"dragon_teenager","2011-08-17T21:15:51.287Z","Excellent for swoosh noises ","Picked up this set a few months back, and it has become one of my favorites from the SP3 line. <br><br>As you can probably tell from the box art, the sleek 'pod racer'-like aesthetic serves this set well. The front end of the Police cruiser is predictably bulky, but the design is intelligent enough to keep it from feeling awkwardly unbalanced. The cruiser looks quite nice in ""police"" mode, with a lot of well-placed fins and smaller wings that make it look very capable of chasing down alien crooks. <br><br>Though the set is generally pleasing to the eye, it does suffer from a few design flaws. For me, the most annoying flaw is that the section directly behind the cockpit is attached with a hinge, and will sometimes flop down. This was necessary for the transforming feature, but I think it could have been easily fixed with a little imagination. Another more obvious issue is that the cruiser can't land on a flat surface without the back end tilting backward. This tends to make the ship look a little awkward on display. The ship lands much more easily when in ""undercover"" mode, but personally I think it looks much better as advertised on the box. <br><br>The transforming feature works well enough, and is deceptively simple, although not quite as satisfying as the transforming gimmicks seen in the third wave of the Alpha Team sets (the helicopter set in particular). This feature does add a nice amount of playability - it is very satisfying to ""reveal"" the police cruiser by transforming from a lowly cargo vessel into a heavy-duty pursuit vehicle - and I think it adds to the set. <br><br>The set also includes an obligatory, if slightly extraneous, ""bad"" vehicle to add playability. This particular incarnation of the traditional ""ridiculously outmatched enemy craft"" is actually quite a bit better than some of the other ones I've gotten. It looks much more complete, and even features some minor greebles for engine detail. You also get a nifty flame piece. <br><br>With only two minifigs, this set might feel a bit overpriced. The figs themselves are acceptable, with a police pilot (featuring a space helmet, thank goodness) and Jawson the space red-light runner. Jawson is a decent minifig, although rather unremarkable compared to some of the other space baddies we've seen in Space Police 3 - definitely one of the theme's strong points. <br><br>Overall, this set's various flaws don't hinder it as much as it might sound like. I find the aesthetics of the two space ships so pleasing, that I don't really mind that the functionality has caused a few design issues. The playability factor is very high here, and I've kept it built much longer than I usually do. <br><br>I'd recommend this set to anybody who likes swooshing enough to forgive a few minor design flaws. Personally, I like it. I give this set high marks. <br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"Capitán_Skrall","2011-09-25T11:48:04.66Z","Awesome design!","So, this is from the second Space Police wave.

"Colonel14","2011-01-18T19:35:45.513Z","Go Undercover!... in style.","<p>I was pretty suprised when the <strong>Undercover Cruiser</strong> became mine when I unwrapped it during Christmas. I had never gotten a Space Police III set before, and this one makes me want more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Build</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build may be a little hard at some parts, but it's cool how the final model turns out. There are plenty of stickers to apply, and they caused me some&nbsp;trouble. The cruiser's main feature: to turn into a carrier ship: is awesome. By bending down the cockpit and connecting the tail end of the ship with a connecter on the underside, the ship transforms into a carrier ship. Just disconnect the tail piece from the underside and bend the cockpit to its original position, and you get the cruiser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cruiser looks pretty odd, but the detail on the engines is great. On the wings by the cockpit are flick-fire missles and other missles for decoration (in other words, they don't fire).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The small criminal speeder is actually pretty well made. A giant flame is used as exaust from the engine. The two 'wings' bend, and each one has a flick-fire missle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Parts</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a good parts selection. You get two cannon pieces, one giant flame, one small blue cockpit shield, four engines, eight dark green cones, and a few trans-red and trans-blue mini slopes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set includes two minifigures, a Space Police Officer and a space criminal named Jawson. The officer has a great torso piece, with front and back printings. Even his legs contain a fair amount of detail!&nbsp;The helmet looks nice, and the officer's head is NOT a smiley! So he looks like he is chasing a criminal, not taking a picture. Jawson has an odd head: you have to see it and describe it yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Playability</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cruiser is very swooshable (meaning it is easy to 'fly' it around and pretend it is a starship). The transformation feature adds to the playability. Will the Space Police Officer catch the evil Jawson? The choice is yours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Overall/Value for Money</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a great set to purchase. Not only is it good for display, it's good for chasing evil space criminals around your bedroom. If you're new to Space Police (like me) then this is a great set to get.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
