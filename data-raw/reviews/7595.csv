Now when it comes to the minifigs those are great. Everyon wants&nbsp; to be Brick Daddy. You could use the torso in almost any city build that a person could build. </p>

<p>The amount of black pieces is very good. Perfect if you are in need of stocking up on all types of black bricks and plates. </p>

<p>Like I said this is a nice set, but I don't see where the set justifies the $40 mark. If it was maybe $30 or even $25 it would be easier to justify the purchase. </p>

"Kalhiki","2010-07-01T13:11:28.073Z","Riding in Style","<p>Oh. My. Gosh. This set is purely amazing. I honestly don't know where to begin. How about building?</p>
<p>BUILDING EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>The building experience was good. There were a few times where I didn't put on a piece or placed a piece in the wrong spot. Once I got confused on how the ship was supposed to be facing, but I got it. And you know, a difficult build is always fun. As for parts there are some pretty good ones. You have&nbsp;Brick Daddy's head, the yellow windshields,&nbsp;and the engine. The engine includes a gold engine block and eight cups also in gold. So overall the pieces are good. Alot of black,&nbsp;gold, and some purple.</p>
<p>MINIFIGS</p>
<p>THE COMMANDO: Basic police officer with&nbsp;Commando design.&nbsp;Not much. He has the helmet and jetpack/oxygen tanks. I find the gun interesting. I don't think it's a new piece, but it's&nbsp;different compared to other Space Police guns. As usual, he has the double printed face, and he is also the&nbsp;main officer from the&nbsp;Space Police animations on the SP website.</p>
<p>JAWSON: There's not much to him as most of his body (where most of the printing should be) is covered by his enormous head. Start with the&nbsp;pants first though. His knees are all scuffed up, and in his pocket he has a nail file probably for filing down the bars on his cell. Also, in small printing, he has 245633 on his pants along with the front and back of his body. There isn't much else&nbsp;to his body. His head wraps around the front and back of his body. Along his back he has big spikes or fins. His face, well, has a big&nbsp;jaw (wonder where he got&nbsp;his name)&nbsp;and two beady eyes. The mouth as usual can hold onto things a minifig could hold.</p>
<p>BRICK DADDY: The star of this set, Brick Daddy has purple pants with no printing. His body has a purple suit coat with a gold undershirt. He also has two pockets and some rips in the clothes. Around his neck, he has a medallion with the skull design.There's not much on the back except for a belt and a coller. His head is very creapy... and small. It somewhat reflects the skull design mentioned before. He has two red eyes surrounded by black. There's really not much else to it, but I would have liked if it was a little&nbsp;bit rubbery. Finally, he has a purple fedora which I love. Lego has a good sense of fashion for their minifigs.</p>
<p>Brick Daddy ranks up with the Fire Resistant Suit Minifigs from Power Miners as my favorite 'figs. I love him.</p>
<p>ACCESORIES</p>
<p>There really is only one. Bricky D. has a speeder bike flying thing. He doesn't really sit on it completely as only the front of the legs are on it. What I do like about it is that it has a gatling gun. What's also good is that&nbsp;it stores in the ship, but Brick D. must be&nbsp;sitting in&nbsp;speeder.</p>
<p>THE LUNAR LIMO</p>
<p>People have said it's too long (like this review :P). It's a limo, it's supposed to be long. The front is very nice and conceals the missle pretty well. It also has some headlights, and&nbsp;a hood ornament&nbsp;which&nbsp;is the same piece as Brick's head. On the sides there are two&nbsp;wings or engines or whatever they might be. Coming out of the front are two&nbsp;laser cannons.&nbsp;On the wings are two fins&nbsp;with stickers that make them look even better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuing on we find the trigger&nbsp;for the cannon&nbsp;which is&nbsp;very subtle. When building, I do advise to put the missle in last because while building, I shot myself with it. The engine is very nice. It is detailed and gold&nbsp;(that must have been expensive). The only thing I don't understand is that the part with the engine block is on a hinge so it can bend upward. Strange. The cockpit is very&nbsp;nice and the yellow windshield is gorgeous. Inside it is very&nbsp;roomy and also has a&nbsp;control panel and two levers. One the&nbsp;outer sides there are also rear view mirrors.The top has an antenna. What I like about the cockpit is that it hinges open so you don't have to completely take it off like othe SP vehicles.</p>
<p>There are more wings and engines to the back. As usual the engines are very detailed and also have fins. The back&nbsp;has what appears to be a spoiler,&nbsp;but in the game on the Space Police website it was a gun. There are also two fins on the back&nbsp;where the&nbsp;rear lights (break signal and turn signal) connect.&nbsp;The license plate says&nbsp;BRICK MAMBA and the trunk&nbsp;actually has a function. You can store the officer inside, but it works better if he's face down. </p>
<p>VALUE AND OVERALL</p>
<p>Yes, definately pay 40 or less if possible. This&nbsp;set as very few flaws and is very stellar. The minifigs are great and look cool. Overall I highly reccommend getting the Lunar Limo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"legoDad42","2010-06-27T17:33:53.5Z","Pimps In Space!","<h4>Brick Daddy with his trusty sidekick/chauffeur Jawson tool around in a 'pimp my ride' style of vehicle...the Lunar Limo. Upon first look at the ship online I wasn't drawn to it but it grew on me at a local LEGO store and I picked one up. Glad I did! This is a nice, uniquely designed vehicle with stark black bricks, accented by gold and touched with purple.</h4>
<h4>Model has a good weight to it, nice details throughout,&nbsp;very 'swooshable' and it's about 17.5"" long.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PRO's...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Well designed vehicle. Looks great at all angles. Stark black exterior throughout, with gold accents.</li>
<li>Nicely designed gold, exposed engine using gold goblets as exhaust/pistons.</li>
<li>2 long laser cannons in front.</li>
<li>Unique, gold hood ornament. Basically Brick Daddy's head/jaw piece in gold without any graphics.</li>
<li>Front, spring loaded cannon. Works well.</li>
<li>Cockpit opens nicely with hinge piece and has two sections, front seating with stickered control panel. Back, longer area for Brick Daddy and his small speeder-like bike. Long antennae atop cockpit.</li>
<li>Small speeder-bike with front 'gattling gun' looking weapon.</li>
<li>Rear section flanked by 2 nicely designed engines with a laser cannon mounted on each one.</li>
<li>Back section has a trunk that can open/close which has enough space to hold a figure with their weapon.</li>
<li>Vanity plate in rear says 'Brick Mamba'. </li></ul>
<p><strong>MINI-FIGS...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jawson is my new favorite head design. Large, long cranium. Well designed and a great look. Has slight printing front/back of torso and front legs have graphics.</li>
<li>Brick Daddy is another wonderfully designed Space Police villain with a glow in the dark skull headed design (just excellent), purple fedora, purple torso with front/back graphics(neat gold looking chain w/gold skull pendant graphic). Purple legs with no graphics.</li>
<li>Space Policeman is your standard duel faced Space figure(one normal/confident face,&nbsp;other screaming like a school girl face)&nbsp;with helmet (w/red visor), front/back torso graphics, front leg graphics and standard issue freeze ray pistol.</li></ul>
<p><strong>CON's...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Purple accents don't seem to work well against the black and gold.</li>
<li>Interior cockpit could've used more details...pimp it out more...a phone, a bar, etc.</li>
<li>Antennae atop opening cockpit falls off from time to time.</li>
<li>Too many stickers. Use the vents and cockpit graphics but the other's are an either/or.Vehicle looks better, IMHO without most of the stickers. Shows off the black more.</li>
<li>Wish cockpit was wider to accommodate some MoDing better.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, a nice change of pace to the Space Police line. A unique villain's vehicle that I <strong>recommend</strong> picking up. Also has some unique parts for you MOC and MoD experts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestion...if you can, get some chrome gold piece to substitute for the gold accents. Give's the Lunar Limo a real tricked out, pimped out look. I'll be doing this and MoDing the interior a bit. Probably add some big speakers to the trunk as well...;)</p>

"dim","2010-11-22T17:13:07.92Z","Notorious B.G.I. (Brick Daddy's Galactic Interceptor)","<p>When I saw this set in pictures, I thought ‘’urgh, that’s cheesy!”. But never say never…<br/><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Minifigures:<br/></strong>One of the reasons to get this set is that this is your only chance to get the Capo of the Black Hole Gang, the infamous Brick Daddy. And of course he had to look like he is the authority! Pimpish purple suit, matching fedora, evil alien face. This guy looks ruthless. The prints are great, the hat is a detailed design and there is even a golden locket shaped as a Black Hole Gang skull. The purple in real is also awesome! Only peculiarity is that his head looks tiny and only good with the hat on. I suspect one reason could be that the same cast is used in golden for the hood ornament of the limo and there it would look otherwise overlarge.&nbsp; However get him!&nbsp; He will surely become collectible soon!<br/>The set includes also Jawson as a driver and a Police officer. Having reviewed both of them in my 5983 Undercover Cruiser review, I will not repeat myself. I just need to notice that it is peculiar for the size of this set that the police officer does not have a vehicle to ride on; he just serves as a hostage in the trunk of the limo.<br/><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lunar Limo:</strong><strong><br/></strong>This is a spaceship that closely resembles an American Limousine, where the wheels have been replaced by wings, adjustable winglets and turbines. Like most Black Hole Gang vehicles it has this retro-futuristic feeling to it, a spaceship inspired by a car. It is a very long vehicle; with roughly half the pieces of a 5974 - Galactic Enforcer it is almost as long. This is the car-designer’s nightmare; the windscreen is too narrow and covered by an incomprehensible ledge, the engine cover reaches higher than the windscreen and obstructs visibility completely, the canter rail is as thick as the side windows, the hood, instead of tapering, becomes higher towards the front etc…&nbsp; But all these mistakes do nothing to take away the coolness of the design. The limo manages to look sleek and intimidating. The design of the front part is very sophisticated and it bears the trademark X-wing arrangement of the winglets which can be seen in many Black Hole Gang spaceships. The decals are very detailed and their pattern is the perfect match for this design. The colour combination looks deliberately cheesy with the garish golden and purple pieces, but it also gives a strong ‘Blacktron I’ flavor to the design, which is most welcome! The only letdown is that the golden paint makes the pieces much cheaper-looking and plasticky. <br/></p>
<p>The Lunar Limo may be the formidable mobile headquarters for Black Hole Gang’s fearsome boss but it does fall short of innovation. There are no notable play features here; there are several hinged parts, so the hood opens, the trunk also, the second row of winglets is adjustable etc… There is also a nicely incorporated shooting function at the front end but we’ve seen this already several times in this series (though here it is really properly in-built). The only feature that would be cool, if better realized, is the tiny Brick Daddy escape pod. As it is, it fits nicely in the interior but is loosely placed and there is not even a simple mechanism to keep it in position. Wouldn’t a mechanism similar to that of the old 6973 - Deep Freeze Defender be cool? At the rear part of that spaceship the escape pod was sitting on a tiny hinged launching platform.&nbsp; Another gripe is that Brick Daddy’s pod may look cool with the Gatling gun on the front, but it’s tiny and flimsy and Brick Daddy is hard to position on it (and he can’t sit properly on it).<br/></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Why, with so many design shortcomings and with no notable functions, this set should be getting three bricks at the most, but no… Its sheer size, coolness factor, dramatic proportions and excellent minifigures, have to count for at least one more brick! 4/5 to be objective and 5/5 in my cool-o-meter!<br/></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4

Large engines and lots of fins and oversized arches on the side make it very dramatic! I applaud Lego greatly for this!<br><br>There is a good selection of bricks in black with lots of useful arches, a variety of small gold bricks and even some purple. I could definately find another use for all the pieces in this set!<br><br>The playability has not been forgotton in this set, it has a very cool spring loaded cannon on the front which is set off by pressing the gold brick, there is very good cabin access for the figs and most importantly it has great 'swooshability' with one hand!

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Chrome gold would have looked way nicer than the pearl gold (but this is forgivable)</li><li>Stickers, but let's be honest--where else would Lego find use for black space pieces with purple and gold pinstriping? &nbsp;I'm not surprised these parts are not printed.</li><li>Brick Daddy's scooter is a bit small</li></ul><p></p><p>As an adult fan, I never got into any of the later Space themes (starting around RoboForce/Insectoids, it was my opinion that things turned south), but this set is a definite exception. &nbsp;Everything about the Lunar Limo is in caricature--giant fins, monstrous engine, and gaudy violet, gold, and jet black color scheme. &nbsp;This thing is hilarious, brilliant, well-detailed, and just plain a lot of fun. &nbsp;And it's deceptively big--this medium-sized vehicle is actually as long as the Cosmic Fleet Voyager, which was a capital ship back in its day. &nbsp;The stickers are in excellent taste and very much add to the style.</p><p>This set evokes a creative and clever sense of humor, too--the golden head of Brick Daddy hood ornament, the 50's style tail fins, the custom pin-striping, the poor peace officer locked in the trunk (no doubt soon to be ""disappeared""--either that, or he's stowing away in hopes of finally locating the Black Hole Gang's secret hide-out), and Brick Daddy's heavily armed gattling gun scooter. &nbsp;And of course Brick Daddy himself, with his outrageous purple suit and matching fedora.</p><p>In terms of playability, the missile in the nose actually packs quite a punch (surprising for Lego who 20 years earlier, actually removed the springs from the little pirate canons back in the day). &nbsp;It'll sail across a room easily, and at point blank will definitely make you jump. &nbsp;There's also Brick Daddy's scooter, the captive in the trunk, and several parts on hinges that will allow you to slightly change configuration. &nbsp;The trunk has plenty of space, easily enough for 300 bars of gold-pressed latinum.</p><p>The Lunar Limo, Brick Daddy's pimped-out awesome-mobile, is a brilliant and hilarious vehicle which would be equally fun as a stand alone display piece or as part of the greater Space Police III world. &nbsp;5/5</p><p></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4

I had not just good, but a great eye!<br><br>The amount of pieces may seem a little bit below your expectations, as you explore the bags, but I assure you that the <b>build </b>is really funny and you are going to love how the Limo comes to life... and it's <i>huge</i>, for a set under 500 pieces, be prepared to be amazed just by it's size!<br>As for me, I'm totally in love on how a old, gangster car became combined with a futuristic style of 1980s and 1990s Sci-Fi, for me it seems a car that a Blade Runner could chase.<br>Going in details, the instructions are well organised in two distinct parts, made one by the big, long, black pieces in the middle, just below the glasses. Don't worry about this, the result has the right amount of sturdiness and it all comes right at the end of instructions.<br><br>The first on the only two complains I could have about the building part is just here: the instructions are quite confusing and there are more than few mistakes in the images. Ok, the building itself it's not so easy, with all these peculiar parts, but they could have made a better job.<br>The most difficult part (and my advice to anyone are going to build this set for the first time) is when you attach the built rear engines and they suggest to attach the long, black pieces that are going to cover the red on the sides <i>after </i>doing so. Well, I strongly suggest to attach them <i>before</i> even construct the engines, as they are going to cover a lot, even the part where the hover part of the Limo are, so it's quite difficult to attach them after.<br><br>The second is really simple to argue: oh yes, stickers!<br>This time they were not all these difficult to apply and there's the great advantage of having them on mostly black bricks, so it doesn't notice too much, if they are not applied perfectly right. But I still want to take away a rate from the building for them also just to made a little protest for not making these lovely printed pieces anymore.<br><br>As for <b>Parts</b>, the Limo has a great amount of strange and peculiar parts to make such an awesome design and I'm totally in love of the anterior wings, as of the long lighted antennas (maybe laser cannones?) and the rear little wings of the trunk.<br>The minifigs are ok and of course Brick Daddy is the best you are going to get. Jawson it's so strange I can't even form an opinion, but I like that the Boss have it's own driver... as for the Policeman, for me it's going to stay in his back prison with his frightened face.<br><br>You can <b>play </b>a lot with this set, the missile itself it's great to use and it's possibile to open almost all parts of the Limo, so there's a lot of interactivity guaranteed. Sure, you must be a little boy/girl to really appreciate a set like this, but I could surely say that I had in mind a lot of adventures for this elegant space car.<br><br>I already said how I spent less then the original <b>price</b>, so I'm satisfied, but I've got to say that the Limo is a really valuable set to have and it's just the overall overpricing in all the Lego products that made me lose one rate.<br><br><b>Overall</b>, I could say that this is the set I'm more satisfied with at all and I'm glad of it, because it met all my expectations and surely exceed them.
