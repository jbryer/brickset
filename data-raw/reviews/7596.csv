"j013","2010-07-05T22:53:47.083Z","space police hq assembled and operational","<p>Space Police Central set 5985, 631 pieces, ages 8-14. It is the best Space Police set ever! It includes 5 minifigures 2 officers (one is the Space Police Chief).&nbsp;Jawson who now bores me since&nbsp;I have 3 (he looks like a dinosaur), and Craniac to sum&nbsp;it up hes really just a red skull twin. Also&nbsp;the&nbsp;X99 Rodot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now on to the station it&nbsp;has&nbsp;1 prison pod truck, 2 rocket bikes, and&nbsp;Craniac's vehicle. The station itself is huge about 9in. tall and 15in. long. there is a small cafe (includes coffee maker) and shooting range behind&nbsp;the prison pod area and radar. There is also a garage with sliding door and tools, on top of the garage is the main station itself with 4 guns, a medal detector, evidence locker and a snifer frog. All under a gigantic dome and to add security there are 2 fences on the perimeter with lasers above them. This is the best Space Police set in my opinion and I highly recommend it!</p>

"Paco_the_Duck_Ninja","2010-07-06T11:01:38.337Z","A fantastic base.","<p>I got this set earlier this summer, and I have to say, I'm very impressed by it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set comes with 5 minifigs: Two Space Police Officers, one of which is the Sheriff, Craniac, Jawson, and a robot. The robot brings to mind the classic old robots from Classic Space, and the two Officers are both exclusive to this set I believe. One has a double sided head, and the other has one side, I believe with the head from the Imperial Admiral from Pirates. Craniac is a dark red recolor of the Skull Twins, and Jawson is completely unique with a two sided body and orange prison suit. Craniac also is exclusive to this set while Jawson is found in all three of the Summer Space Police sets. The Officers come with the great new commando style helmets with a trans red visor. The Sheriff has black empaulettes, although I put those on a different fig. (My Space Police leader is my only Space Police 2 officer!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main part of the base comes on a rare dark gray baseplate, and even after the model is assembled, there is a lot of room on the plate for play and modifications. There is a decently sized ""Prison"" that is elevated with a very useful part, it comes with two of those ""Prison Pods"" that you can store Jawson and Craniac in. It also has a comm satelite, and racks for handcuffs (my set came with at least five or six pairs) There also are two white laser gates to keep out intruders, although these can bend and fall apart easy, especially the trans-red lightsaber blades atop them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ""garage"" is two stories, the bottom story is empty, and you can use it to store the Police truck inside, it also has racks for blasters and maintence tools. The second story is the main command center of the base, with many nice printed parts, always good for MOCs. It also has a blaster rack, and two storage containers, one for ""evidence"" (Three pistols, two of which has trans-blue axe blades on them. (I didn't like how they looked, so I took them off and made an axe out of them.) The other of which is a ""Sniffer frog."" I like to imagine how that came to be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lego employee: (shouting in a noisy room) AND ADD A SNIFFER DOG TO THE DESIGN!</p>
<p>Lego employee 2: WHAT?</p>
<p>Lego employee: A SNIFFER DOG!</p>
<p>Lego employee 2: SNIFFER FROG? ... OKAY...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sniffer frog is a unique element, I believe. The garage door works very well, although there is always a part of it that is left uncovered. There also is a pair of defence blasters on the base, and a deck on it, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second part of the base is built on&nbsp;a 16x16 driveway&nbsp;baseplate. It is a vehicle launchway and a cafe, which comes with a coffee maker, but,&nbsp;sadly no donuts. The speeder launch effect does not work very well, it always leans down and the speeders can easily fall off that way. Also, in the instructions, it does not clearly say to built two speeders, so I came out with many extra parts without realizing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vehicles that come with the set are nothing special. Craniac's is the coolest. It has a spring missile launcher that can be used to break open a prison pod, and there also is a Space Truck that has a prison pod on the back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts that come with this set can be reused for some good MOCs, but with such a well designed set, I prefered to let it be like it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money is very good, $80 is good for what you get, although they could have thrown in another Officer (There were three SP vehicles in the set, so it would have made sense to.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability is also very good for this set, you can do Prison Break scenarios, Alien assaults, of a Whodunnit to find out who took the last of the cafe's coffee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, I would definantly reccomend this set, I believe it to be one of the best values for you money in this theme (Pick up a Raid VPR, too, it goes well with this set.).</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"vynsane","2010-10-12T18:56:40.157Z","This is an All-Points-Bulletin: Craniac is on the loose in a suped-up speeder!","<div>At this time, of all the LEGO themes out there, Space Police 3 is the one I have the most of - in fact, I'm only missing two sets out of the entire line thus far (those being ""Squidman's Pitstop"" and ""K-9 Bot"") making me the Space Police 3 authority (in my own mind).</div><div><br></div><div>When I think of LEGO Space, and any subtheme thereof, I mainly think about spaceships, not buildings, so when I first saw Space Police Command I wasn't all that impressed. Having picked this up last week during the first week of Bricktober at Toys R Us for 30% off, plus using a $10 off $50 ""Rewards R Us"" coupon (brining this puppy down to almost half price) I must say how ecstatic I am to be proven wrong.</div><h4>Figures</h4><div><ul><li><b>""The Chief""</b> - With his retro-styled gray mutton chop/mustache combo and black epaulets, this guy is obviously meant to be the Chief of Space Police who's ""seen it all"".</li><li><b>""The Rookie""</b> - His be-soul-patched baby face and cool smirk barely cover the true demeanor of a small-planet fish-out-of-water rookie who might just crack under pressure (he's got a double-sided head, one calm and collected, one panicked).</li><li><b>Jawson</b> - Giving <a href=""/minifigs/?m=sp097"">Snake</a> a run for his money in the ""how many times can you be in a set"" category, Jawson is still really unique and cool with his oversized head and orange prisoner jumpsuit (though, they could've given him a different outfit in at least ONE of his appearances.)</li><li><b>Craniac</b> - At the opposite end of the spectrum, we have one of the rarest SP3 minifigures in this set. Sporting a dark red version of the 'Skull Twins' mask, a dark red body with what appears to be armored exoskeleton plates, and a cool spider-like head, Craniac not only looks menacing but is in high demand.</li></ul></div><h4>Accessories</h4><div>There are SO many accessories that it would be folly to mention them all here. There are four 'ray guns', one metal detector and a bunch of handcuffs. The stand-out accessories to note, though, are:</div><div><ul><li><b>Revolver w/axe blade</b> (x2) - The addition of a translucent light blue axe blade to the standard minifig pistol makes it at once grounded in realism and requisitely sci-fi. According to the directions, one goes to Craniac, and the other goes in the ""Evidence"" locker, though if Jawson is on the loose, I presume it's his.</li><li><b>Frog</b> - I COULDN'T BELIVE MY EYES! Never did I anticipate receiving a LEGO Frog in this set! He's got his own little cubby in the command center with the label ""Sniffer Frog"". Do Frogs have a good sense of smell? I don't know, but it's awesome.</li></ul></div><h4>Parts</h4><div>There are a lot of great pieces in this set, starting with the translucent dark blue windscreens. The two huge ones comprise the windows of the command tower, and the other, more boxy looking one is the roof/windshield for the 6x6 vehicle. There are also four translucent red 4L bars (yes, lightsaber blades! Evil ones!) and even a lone lightsaber hilt (used in the center of the radar dish at the top of the command tower). There are four white printed 2x2 45 degree slopes (two being the same printing, the other two unique) and two train 'Cow Catcher' slopes! Talk about imaginative usage of pieces!</div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-weight: bold; ""><br></span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-weight: bold; "">Build</span></div><div>The build is a mixed bag - there are some REALLY advanced techniques used (especially on the sideways garage door) and some oddly elementary bits where pieces are planted to a baseplate without being supported by the rest of the structure, as is the case with the ""Evidence"" and ""Sniffer Frog"" lockers - they just sit on the floor next to an outside wall, whereas in other builds they might have been incorporated INTO the wall. The way they are situated undermines playability a bit, as my daughter has pushed too hard opening or closing the boxes and popped the piece right off the floor. That said, she absolutely LOVES playing with this set. The garage door is the stand-out part of the build, using a wealth of SNOT techniques to facilitate what is usually a vertical rolling door. Little touches like the coffee machine in the break room (situated beneath the two Police speeders) are very cool and funny. There's a shooting range behind the prison pods, though the side of the garage is open - there's no wall on the side where the door stows when open, which seems odd to me. I would think you would want to make the door stow on the side WITH the wall, making it more open-air like the garage and shooting range are in the same area. There is also no roof on the shooting range, which seems a bit odd to me.</div><div><br></div><div>The build on the bad guy vehicle is your standard 'Black Hole Gang Speeder' build - a couple of technic liftarms and/or technic bricks with a seat attached, a rocket launcher, and some control sticks. Add some engines with flames coming out, rinse, repeat. The orange accents this time around do a respectable job of making it look unique amongst all the other preceding variations.</div><div><br></div><h4>Playability</h4><div>My nearly 4y/o daughter really loves this set. There are so many things to do, like put the bad guys in the jail pods, move them with the truck, pop one of the officers on a speeder and swoosh them around, have a dogfight with Craniac on the BHG speeder, etc. As per usual, you can fire the missile at the prison pod 'Field Generators' (read: round technic discs) and pop open the prison pod to make good the escape of whatever bad guy happens to reside therein but, as is the case with all the other SP3 sets, you need good aim and quite the narrow proximity to really make it work. As stated above, some of the more rudimentary building techniques lead to some issues, but over-all it's just a fun set!</div><div><br></div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>At $80 (USD) this set is a bit steep in price, though the rarity and/or coolness factor of some pieces offsets that cost. If you can find it on sale for 30% or better, it's an absolute STEAL. Be on the lookout for this one come Black Friday this year, as I'm sure it will go fast if they put it on special.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Daniel_Valkenburg","2010-10-01T03:52:53.66Z","great!","A very nice looking set, with a&nbsp;nod back in time to the 6930, I feel. The space-scooters are great looking as is the base in self. I like the fact the every piece of the base is reachable by ladder. The only part, that I feel could have been build better is the vehicle, but apart from that I think this is a great set!
