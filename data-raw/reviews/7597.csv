When I saw it i really wanted to have it but it wasn't released (or at least I thought it). However, after beein searching here and there, I found that Amazon France was selling it, and even better, having it in stock!. So without any lack of time I just ordered 2 days ago and got it yesterday. Was kinda afraid as there were no image of the truck on the Amazon.fr page, so maybe I was ordering the wrong product. But hopefully everything was perfect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let's start.<br/></strong>After opening the box, the set come in 3 packages numbered as 1, 2 and 3. Instruction booklet split the building in 3 parts being the 1st the under part of the truck, the figures and the set boxes, the 2nd the ""cockpit"" of the truck and the 3rd being the ""container"" of the sets. All in flashy yellow color. (Special mention to the Lego logo stickers, just Amazing!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building it took me around 2 Hrs 1/2 as I always want to take time and enjoy the pleasure of building, personally I must say it relax me quite a lot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first part of the building is the under part of the truck, the figures and the small set boxes. Building was easy, and the best part is putting the stickers of the sets on the blue squares. They came by 6 (biggers) representing the firemens, and the truck itself lolol! The 3 smallers would fit better with the police car. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second part was easy to build as well, the cabin comes with a bed, a cup of coffee for the trucker, or tea, or chocolate lol and a nice TV (which is actually the same PC look like square. It was kinda dissapointing but ok). However, at the moment to plug the cabin to the under structure of the truck it doesn't fit properly, I think is related about the plastic or the way the squares allowing the plug of the cabin are disposed. I think it could be better. After 5 minutes dealing to fix it properly, you have to make some pressure between them to make it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third part was the easiest one as the ""container"" have big pieces. Also was a pleasure to put the stickers on it. I made a small modification, putting the big side Lego Stickers close to the side doors as it give in my opinion more visibility to the logo and is more aestetically better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After it, try to ""play"" with it and I realised that the big is kinda big, maybe it could have been better when the container is not to big, so it's easy to turn (if you play with the street plates) and beeing the amount of ""Lego sets"" included not so much, it could be definitively smaller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price was good, as you get something original and makes kinda a tribute to Lego. At the end, I put the sets on the ""Toys Dept."" of my Grand Emporium set. So people can go and buy Legos in the Lego City. Crazy isn't? ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall conclusion.</strong></p>
<p>A great set to have! Worth the price and it's a nice addition to your Lego City! :D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

"starwarsgeek101_","2010-05-30T12:10:54.263Z","Simply Awesome","<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>I bought this set at Toys R US for $35, which was somewhat of a punch to my budget, but the set is just too likeable to refuse. It comes with 2 minifigures, both of which you would normally see in a City set. The red hat has a slightly different design so that if you put it backwards, it won't cover the eyes. There is also a sticker sheet, of course. Applying the Lego set stickers is probably the most difficult task in the entire build.</p>
<h4>The Build</h4>
<p>Since the set is a ""Moderate Build"" it is seperated&nbsp;into numbered bags. Bag 1 contains the minifigures and the base for the driver section of the truck, while bag 2 completes the driver section. This particular section has a nice interior, with a bed and a TV. Bag 3 has all the pieces for the cargo part of the truck. This section doesn't take very long at all to build. The total time to build this set would be approximatly 30-40 minutes.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The set is a bit unstable and the legs that bend forward to stop the truck tend to fall off quite a bit, but the unique interior, along with the details of the driving section of the truck, make this set 4-5 stars.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4

The set goes together easy, the little Lego branded boxes are a great little feature. The directions have you build the two lower sides of the truck where the fuel tank would be slightly different for each side, that didn't make sense so I built them to look the same but a mirror opposite like a real truck.

I'm a collector of the city/town theme for Legos and this is a must have for any collector. This is the coolest truck hauler that lego has ever came out with, and the fact that it has mini ""lego sets"" is cool as well. Overall its a very simple and easy build, took me about 45 minutes. It has a lot of yellow, blue and red elements as those were the original 3 colors of lego, I find it a fitting tribute seeing as its a Lego Hauler. Very much worth every penny I paid for. 35.99 retail at Toys R Us but i had a couple discount coupons so I ended up paying about 25 after tax. Still worth the 35.99 in my opinion.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

Cute:P<br><br>So I bought one box as soon as the set arrived on local store here. When I built it, the truck was really come out nicely. Love the details they are putting for the truck. This truck even own their own bed and TV set located on the back of the driver's seat, so the driver can sleep and get some entertainment when they drive from city to city. Very nice details.

Stickers : I think Lego is getting too lazy (or too cost conscious?) for making printed parts. All the Lego logos and the box set are done using stickers, not printed. I hate stickers, because they will fell of after some time. <br>2. Box sets : The amount of those cute blue boxes is too little. I mean, with a truck size this big, but they only give us around 8 boxes?<br><br>&nbsp;Recap :<br>I love the yellow truck, love the little blue boxes.

"Nesquik","2012-03-04T10:03:16.95Z","City Truck is a City Essential","<div>I'll make the opening short; Lego's 3221 'City Truck' is by far and away one of the best City products I've bought since the theme was introduced. I've always been a fan of any branded products because of their cheekiness, and so I was delighted when the Lego Group introduced a new truck.</div><div><br></div><div>First off, this truck is definitely inspired by real life American rigs, and is therefore not a completely original design for the Lego city. I read many reviews that stated the main vehicle/cabin was ""too sloped"" or sluggish, but I think these owners may be forgetting that the Lego group have consistently looked for inspiration from design features all over world - they can't always be european. Despite this, I am actually a fan of the design and feel that it represents an iconic 'truck-look' without being overly pretentious.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This vehicle has some excellent features, including the lid (see the Lego sticker) that opens and closes on a hinge for easy access to the cabin, the big wing mirrors, the nice spacious interior and a wall mounted computer. Plenty of warning/hazard lights are also located around the vehicle just like in real life. Some have suggested that the cabin should have ""two seats, so that other man can sit in too"". Again this is poor observation, because the man with the cap is working at the depot and it is his job to move the packages in and out of the trailer with the included red trolley. The driver, on the other hand, is a driver! And a serious coffee drinker by the looks of his mug...</div><div><br></div><div>If I'm nit picking, the only two changes I can imagine being made had the product been a higher RRP would be larger wheels and a flip up engine lid.</div><div><br></div><div>Another area for debate is the 'pin and disc' method used to connect the trailer to the vehicle. I've had a good look (and play about) with this system and I find it hard to judge where the complaints stem from. The pin slots into the 4x4 flat disc so that, once inserted, it has the ability to move about on an axis in order to provide suspension and shock absorption - particularly when turning tight angles. The only way that the pin part can come away from the trailer is if the user, literally, bends the trailer and forces the part to come away. However, if you simply lift the trailer vertically (as you're supposed to), it comes away without breaking. Call me Mr Obvious, but I think this is just common sense.</div><div><br></div><div>We then have the trailer itself, which is itself an empty 'shell' composed of nine large yellow facias and various components holding them in place. Because it is empty, the user may put whatever little packages they like inside the trailer through the various doors on either side and rear end, or through removing the roof section which is intentionally held on a bit looser with a mix of flat and studded plates. Aside from the beautiful Lego decals (stickers, sadly), the best component of this build is the wheel housing. Those genius designers made a lovely mini-build that literally suspends on a single pin and allows the trailer to tilt left, right, back and forth.</div><div><br></div><div>In this instance, I would partly agree with other reviewers that the trailer is a little on the more fragile side, but that depends on how rough you play with it. For gliding the truck around, this thing just isn't going to break at all, but I imagine that in hands which are too young, then obviously it will come apart. I personally believe however that the 5-12 age category is pushing it a bit for this model, and would definitely more up to the 8-12 region.</div><div><br></div><div>The final delight is the selection of 'packages' that come with the product - nine in total. They are only made from 4x4 bricks with flat plates and stickers, but the stickers themselves have cleverly been designed to replicate not only the packaging for this model, but for other City products too. As I said earlier on, it's a cheeky little world these guys have got! It also provides an incentive to make your own little packages and just fill the trailer full of interesting goods.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You don't even have to place all the 'Lego' stickers on the vehicle, as you could keep it to a more universal/open delivery truck that could transport all kinds of components. Given the amazing length of this product (39cm!), it would be great for placing long tiles and 1x8 bricks inside for building site.</div><div><br></div><div>How happy am I? Over the moon to say the least. I have always been a fan of simpler builds because they represent their counterpart a lot clearly, and I can't imagine any Lego fan or young boy that could resist this lovely big, bright truck. It has minor draw backs, but these are clearly not enough to even put a purchase in question. It will be discontinued soon too!</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5

"TangDynasty","2011-02-08T22:04:03.037Z","Big Bright Yellow Truck!","<p>My son wanted this truck for the longest time. Who can resist a big bright yellow Lego truck? Well, I did resisted buying this for a while as the price was a tad high for my liking. So when there was a sale (about 20% off), I was 'persuaded' to get it.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box is attractive with a big bright yellow Lego truck. A small picture at the bottom front tells you how long the truck is. One thing I noticed at the back of the box is that they did not feature the sleeping area. In my opinion, it would have been better &nbsp;to feature that rather than showing the inside of the empty container. Maybe, Lego is trying to show potential buyer how big the container is.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The usual parts so nothing to shout about here. But, we like the yellow colour. Its a bright and cheerful colour. However, the 'boxes' provided was too few. Only 9 of them. We can of course make more ourselves but it just won't be the same without the stickers. In this aspect, it was a tad disappointing.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>2 minifigures here. They are nice additions and the details are pretty nice. We especially like the cap. It's a bit curve at the sides and not like the old one.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The build is really straight forward. My 7 year old son did it all by himself and he did not find it difficult. So if you are looking for a challenging build, this is not for you. One thing that is 'weak' in this set is the roof of the truck.&nbsp;It is a nice to have the hinges for the roof &nbsp;so that we can just open up the top of the truck. Unfortunately, it comes off very often. It can get frustrating as we have to keep fixing it back.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is nice. It's our first City set so I must say we are happy with it.

"AETerry","2011-05-15T14:01:34.917Z","LEGO City Truck Review","<p>This set along with the 7848 Toys R Us Truck set are very similiar where the build and construction of vehicles are concerned. The difference of course is the color of bricks used, this truck using yellow and LEGO's own logo and minibuilds for boxes with a delivery truck delivering product within a Lego City or Town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like 7848, I also did a slight modification of the build on the truck so it would be symetrical in appearance instead of lop sided. In the picture you can see the grey cylindrical piece, it's that part of the step that's modified so the piece on the opposite side is in the same spot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two minifigures, the truck driver, who looks exactly like the Toys R Us truck driver and a guy wearing overalls with a redcap who's pushing a dolley around for loading and unloading the boxes of lego sets on/off the truck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've already bought the Toys R Us Truck set or you buy it after having picked up this set up first, you'll see that repetitiveness in build. I figure that's alright given how solid a build these trucks have and it's fun to see some ""real-world"" products and logos in a Lego City/Town, adding a sense of realism to it. Which can be fun provided it's not obvious or forced or the price of a set goes up as a result.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"clundsberg","2010-12-10T18:04:13.017Z","Rollin' Down The Highway Lego-Style","<p>This is an extremely excellent set.&nbsp; My son just received this today on his 6th b-day and it's currently holding it's own against a newly acquired Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>It's just that good.</p>
<p>When we first saw this item at the store, my son broke out into hysterical laughter at what he considered a nice little joke:&nbsp; ""A Lego Truck that is selling Legos and LOOK it has pictures of some of my Lego sets on the boxes!""</p>
<p>Right then and there I knew what he was getting for his Birthday.</p>
<p>The actual build is pretty neat.&nbsp; Not as boring or repetitious as most symmetrical vehicles seem to be.&nbsp; It was almost more a a center to outward build...a very sturdy cab.&nbsp; It has a very spacious trailer that can store the boxes, the red truck/cart that is included&nbsp;and tons more of whatever cargo needs a-transportin.&nbsp; When separated from the cab, the trailer has a hinge-stand to maintain stability.&nbsp; The trailer's wheels are a neat little build in and of themself that reminded me of Optimus Prime's ""Roller"" vehicle. (cudos to anyone who manages to convert this semi into Optimus Prime by the way)</p>
<p>The cab portion is extremely detailed:&nbsp; The flip-up canopy for driver access (while it breaks off every once in a while) is a beautiful touch.&nbsp; Inside there is a seat for a driver, a bed, dashboard for coffee mug, and television.&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally I'm disappointed that Lego vehicles do not make room for 2 seats, however since there is a bed in there, that's plenty of room for a secondary figure.&nbsp; Outward appearances like&nbsp;2 sets of side windows and, side gas tanks and clear over orange fornt light/brake and turn signals and roof lights are a plus.</p>
<p>This is a nice long semi which makes for an authentic feel.&nbsp; Lots of stickers (many people on here seem to complain about stickers, but they...) add to the detail of this rig and it's contents.</p>
<p>This is a quasi-expensive set around the $35-40 mark, but I also think this is one of those sleeper sets that is pure gold (or...er...yellow) and collectors may regret not purchasing it while it's easily available.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

I got this as a gift from my grandad, and well, when ever look at it make me smile. The detail is just shocking, the mini-figures are unbeatable and the price for each brick is as good as the set. Also i will add some think new to my reviews.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE BOX </p>
<p>Its nice, good&nbsp;sample of the many things you&nbsp;can do with it and as&nbsp;with some bigger sets it shows you how long it is. I would also&nbsp;like to say that if you live in the U.S.A you get the name, pieces and some other things ware as in the UK we just get the age and number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE BUILD </p>
<p>Very good, griping, keeps you building. I like that the more newer sets have numbered bags, so to thoose who are not bright sparks at building a 1000 plus set in a big mess. It takes about 10/20/30 minutes, but as allways it depends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PLAYABILITY</p>
<p>Very, very good. The amount of things one can do with a lego truck!! Supermarkets, airports, toy makers, toy shops, the list go's on what you can add to it. The lego box's add a lot more playability along with the worker. I mean, how can you go wrong with a lego truck??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PARTS</p>
<p>A great use of old classic's. Some of the parts, mostly in the cab, are rarely made, making this even more of a gem. One more part is the cab's door, witch made its come back about 2 years ago. Great if you need a truck in a MOC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE MONEY</p>
<p>In the UK, it was Â£30, but i got it for Â£20. Â£30 is to much but on the sale price its what lego shold be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OVERALL RATING</p>
<p>Five bricks out of five bricks, how can you rate it at 4??</p>

"Steamrunner","2011-01-02T21:15:44.587Z","Not bad, but a few bugs","As someone who has only recently become reacquainted with Lego, I picked this up as I saw it going cheap in my local Tesco (less than a tenner). For that price, and really only intended as a parts purchase, I thought there was no harm in throwing it in the basket with the groceries.<br><br>Up until this set I'd been busy with the Mindstorms set I got from my wife for Christmas, although I had also bought the 8043 Excavator which was yet to be tackled, so this is my first ""proper"" Lego set for about 25 years or so. I hadn't really looked at the pictures on the box, so when I finished building it I was quite surprised at the amount of detail in the model. The front bumper is shaped, there are lights all over, there's a bed in the cab (and a TV), and generally lots of little details that show that a lot of thought has been put into this model.<br><br>Which is why it's so surprising that there are still a few bugs (for want of a better term). For example, where the cab sides meet the back of the cab there are gaps (due to the pieces used to form the sides). This is very odd and really stands out on an otherwise flawless design. The trailer sides are held together by a few short studded pieces along the top, with longer smooth pieces in between - I really cannot understand why this is (they're not used for a second model as there are only instructions for this one) as because they are different pieces, you can see the difference from the side of the trailer. It's a small thing, but I just don't understand why they'd use smooth pieces instead of studded ones all round. Very odd. The final design flaw is that the lift-up roof - which is a lovely touch, don't get me wrong - tends to pop off if you raise it (or indeed lower it) as the hinge piece isn't held in place. Since I don't ""play"" with the models as such (except for showing my wife, who was also quite surprised at how much Lego has changed since we were kids) it doesn't really bother me as I won't be opening it, but I can see it getting annoying for kids who do want to play at putting the figures in the cab. One final thought, and this is a good thing, is that it's nice to have the choice if whether you have whopping great Lego logos on the pieces. I haven't used the stickers, so the pieces won't look odd if I use them elsewhere.<br><br>Anyway, although I think the kit is slightly overpriced at full RRP, it's a lovely model and really quite impressive to see what can be done with a small amount of bricks and a lot of attention to detail. I'm impressed - and if the roof didn't keep coming off when moved, I'd even go so far as to say <span style=""font-style: italic;"">really</span> impressed.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

The sticker sheet has LEGO logos in various sizes, but those have become more and more common in recent years. In the end&nbsp;you&#39;re still better off passing on&nbsp;this if you don&#39;t care about the build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build process</p>

<p>I greatly value the building process, and&nbsp;sadly this set did not excite me that much with its building techniques or part usage. The connection of&nbsp;the rearmost wheels&nbsp;to the trailer is mildly interesting, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the construction of the trailer&#39;s&nbsp;cargo area is pretty poor. Before connecting the roof plates, the entire build is incredibly fragile and is easily broken if everything&#39;s not perfectly aligned when adding&nbsp;new parts.&nbsp;Fortunately, once the roof is added&nbsp;the build is fully solid and you needn&#39;t bother about accidentally breaking it anymore. Because the trailer is a quick build&nbsp;using a lot of large parts, this luckily isn&#39;t very&nbsp;bothering in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>On a sidenote, rebuilding the set&nbsp;did bring me back to the good &#39;ol days of City trucks and cars with&nbsp;its wonderfully nostalgic and&nbsp;straight-forward yet effective design.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Features</p>

<p>Aside the obvious features like having spinning wheels and the like, here are some things that I thought to be&nbsp;noteworthy:</p>

<p>- there&#39;s a lot of space inside the cabin which has been used to house a driver&#39;s area, a&nbsp;bed/couch and a tv. It&#39;s slightly tricky to get both figures in comfortably, but it can be done without any major hiccups.</p>

<p>- the trailer hitch is pretty loose, however it won&#39;t come off by just riding or displaying it. It also makes attaching and detaching super easy.&nbsp;Just don&#39;t expect it to come along if you only hold the cabin while picking it up.</p>

<p>- there&#39;s a dead-simple folding mechanism for the trailer&#39;s landing gear, but it works&nbsp;very well!</p>

<p>- accessing the spacious interior&nbsp;of the trailer is harder and a bit more frustrating than it should be. There&#39;s a couple small doors that work alright, but the small amount of tiny LEGO boxes rattle around easily and will only come out by tilting the trailer until they drop. You can detach the roof plates, but they&#39;re firmly connected and if not done carefully you&#39;re at risk of breaking off some wall panels as well.</p>

<p>- included is, of course, a pile of minifig-sized LEGO-boxes! There&#39;s nine in total, one of which depicts this very set. It&#39;s very meta and&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought it was hilarious as a kid. However, compared to the cargo space this is a very minimal amount.&nbsp;I&#39;d love&nbsp;to fill up the truck more,&nbsp;perhaps even with some pallets. Well, that&#39;s what Bricklink is for! :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Appearance</p>

<p>Well, what can I say? It&#39;s a big, yellow truck, with an American-styled cabin shape and&nbsp;LEGO logos all over it. But, it&#39;s one of the very few depictions LEGO has made of their delivery vehicles&nbsp;and, in my opinion, by far the cleanest-looking&nbsp;one. Additionally, this subject has only been represented&nbsp;once&nbsp;after&nbsp;this set,&nbsp;being the delivery&nbsp;van that came as part of set #60097 Town Square in&nbsp;2015.</p>

<p>Even though this set is 5 years older than #60097 and is currently approaching its 12th birthday, the aged design doesn&#39;t look out of place next to the current lineup of City vehicles. So, all in all, if a LEGO-LEGO delivery truck is what&nbsp;you want, #3221&nbsp;is still your safest bet!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verdict</p>

<p>LEGO City Truck is a wonderful example of the&nbsp;timeless nature of LEGO&nbsp;products. Even after&nbsp;a decade, LEGO hasn&#39;t remade the subject yet; I like to think it&#39;s because with how well #3221 holds up, there&#39;s simply no need for an update. The minor flaws don&#39;t detract from all the great things that the set has to offer, and I feel that this overall is one of the most successful and memorable LEGO City products in history.</p>
