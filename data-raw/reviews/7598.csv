"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-20T13:00:17.32Z","LEGO World Racers - Jagged Jaws Reef Review","The built of this set is very easy and also lot's of fun. For my surprise this set doesn't come with numbered bags. You also get a lot of stickers which you have to put on. I think LEGO should print those pieces because they would be rare to find. We get a shark, a buoy with a trophy and the checkered flag for my surprise. On the older checkered flag pieces we didn't have to put on stickers in the past. This set also includes a boat for the <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Backyard Blasters </span>and for the <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Team Extreme</span>.<br><br>Both minifigs are very cool too. The <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Backyard Blasters</span> character comes with the awsome printed overalls and helmet. On his face he has a bandanna and on the other side of the face you can see a scared face. The design with the sideburns looks a little bit like Elvis. The other minifig has a cool overall and helmet as well. On his face he got some goggles and a headset. The face of that <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Team Extreme</span> minifig is double-printed.<br><br>The boats are very sturdy. The <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">Backyard Blasters</span> boat has some chain saw pieces. The engine on the back does sviwel and on the front we have a nice v6 engine and a harpoon. The engine is a little bit in the way if you want to push the harpoon. I recommend you to take the v6 engine off if you want to use this feature. The <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">Team Extreme</span> boat looks very awsome with those stickers. But as I said: The set would be much cooler if the markings are printed on the pieces. The main feature for this boat is the catapult which shoots fish. If you put the head of the fish in the keg the fish will fall out very easily. If you're not using this feature I recommend you to put this fish piece to the boat driver. All in all I can't really complain about this set.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on LEGO Shop@Home, eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>my son really enjoys the shark, I wish that there was a 3rd team. </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"mathmatt88","2011-06-04T17:28:25.767Z","Pretty decent set...","I got this set because I found it for $14. &nbsp;I wouldn't have purchased it otherwise - although the price is about right.<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<div>Pros:</div><div>Some fairly rare parts I have have not encountered. &nbsp;(I came out with 3 new parts!)</div><div>For a kid, I assume the playability is great!</div><div>Minifig faces are neat!</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div>WAY too many stickers - I don't apply stickers so my boats are fairly boring.</div><div>The fish launcher is fun, but the fish doesn't stay in the barrel, let alone fire affectively.</div><div><br></div><div>If you can find the set for cheap, purchase for the kids or for the valuable parts!</div></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
