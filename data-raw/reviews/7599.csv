"Takeshi","2010-08-05T18:20:52Z","Motorbike race","This is a cool little set. An easy way to get two different motorbike types, a piece of dynamite, and a trophy. On with the Pros and Cons!<br><br>Pros:<br><br>Two bikes: You get the two most common bikes in this set, one in black, the other in green. Really nice if you don't already have any bikes.<br><br>Pieces: Wide variety. Missiles, dynamite, space police helmet, hoth visor, and an all-new trophy piece. Pretty nice :)<br><br>Rocket Launcher: Contrary to the other reviews posted, I have found that the rocket launcher is not that hard to use, and can actually fire pretty far. IF you pull it back far enough. It helps if you pull from the lip of the cup instead of actually pressing on the missile.<br><br>Cons:<br><br>STICKERS!: It would seem that all lego series will have one major flaw. The major flaw of the World Racers series is the amount of stickers you have to put on. They aren't that easy to put on either.<br><br>Not enough parts: You don't get a whole lot of pieces, most likely because of the large size of some of them.<br><br>Overall: It's a great little set, with high playability. I would recommend this set to anyone who likes world racers or needs some bikes.<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5

It's an odd mix though.<div>The set revolves around two bikes that are unlikely to ever meet in any normal race;&nbsp;a full fairing touring bike and&nbsp;a moto-cross bike with a sidecar. This sidecar doesn't hold a passenger but some sort of rocket-launching contraption. The rider on the touring bike has dynamite with him.&nbsp;There's a podium and a trophy and for some reason there's a snake in the set as well.</div><div><br></div><div>I don't get this World Racers theme. I understand racing and the idea of different types of races (boats, bikes, cars) around the world is fine. But why does every theme nowadays need to have good guys, bad guys and violence? I would have preferred a set&nbsp;without dynamite and rockets and&nbsp;with a third motorbike instead.</div><div><br></div><div>Having said that the bikes look great, thanks to lots of stickers (9 on the black bike and 6 on the green dirt bike). Applying all those stickers takes more time than the actual build. The dirt bike element has been around a while but it's great to have it in lime now.</div><div>The minifigs also look great. Both have double prints on their heads and nice prints on their torsos and helmets. The dirt biker also has a print on his legs and the Space Police III helmet with snow goggles looks perfect as a dirt bikers helmet.</div><div><br></div><div>So what we have here are two great looking bikes and two great looking minifig riders in an otherwise somewhat confusing set.</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-21T05:09:26.387Z","LEGO World Racers - Snake Canyon Review","This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also get a lot of stickers in this set. This model also comes with a podium, a trophy and a snake. There're also 2 motorcycles in this set: We get a black one which has a really nice looking design. On one side you can also see a dynamite piece. The lime green motorcycle has a nice looking sidecar with a catapult but that feature doesn't work really well. The minifigs are very cool and the figure of the Team Extreme team has a very cool looking design as well. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces

But the motorcycles that could be gotten easilly in this set, minifigs, trophy and some of the accessory pieces such as the little bundle of dynamite... make this set a fun one to get.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2012-01-09T18:23:20.51Z","World Racers Start Your Engines","<p>Set #8896 Snake Canyon: I kept seeing this set on store shelves when it initially came out while looking for other Theme Sets from ones I favor more than most of LEGO's Racers Themes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually I decided that I would buy it, to see what draw, if any, it might have. Honestly... I like it, but I think I would have been better served getting a much larger World Racers Set to compliment it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is nothing much to build here, two different bikes and a small trophy stand. However the Bikes are pretty wicked looking, the Black Racer's bike is covered in flame decals (and yes, both bikes rely heavily on stickers for their detailing), with an impressive flaming skull emblem on it. He carries a stick of dynamite attached to the rear of his bike, pretty dangerous stuff for this guy to do considering if he wiped out he'd literally blow his chances of wining this race.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Green Racer's Bike is more like a Dirt Bike while the previous bike is a familiar looking design, Catwoman drives a motorcycle around just like it in purple. The Green Racer actually has a small side-car attachment, but not for Mini-Figures, this guy has two launchable rockets for explosive results. They are designed to be launched by pulling the piece back and then letting it fly, but it admittedly doesn't seem to want to work very well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trophy stand is just that, a little stand where the winner, loser and a third contestant would stand after competing the race. The trophy included looks pretty neat and I will admit right now that the biggest draw for me for buying this set, aside from the two bikes, was because it allowed me to get that trophy piece at a cheap price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rounding out what we have to say on this set is the final three pieces. A red snake is included to explain away why it's called Snake Canyon, personally I think the Bike Race or something equally simple would have served much better. There is no actual canyon to build, so really what was the point of that name?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are pretty darn snazzy looking though, if you're a fan of unique Mini-Figures and even more unique printing these two do not dissapoint. The black racer has a double sided torso, with printing of the flaming skull on his back and some race paraphernalia on the front of his jacket. He also has the flaming skull on his helmet and a double sided head, one side has the lower face covered by some sort of mask, perhaps to keep the sand out of his mouth when he flips his vizor up, the other reveals the full on side burns he's sporting and a nasty looking teeth revealing sneer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The green racer has even greater detailing, his upper torso has printing on it that evokes a Dirt Biker's race uniform, with back printing as well, and he has printing on his legs as well that continue the allusion to a jumpsuit style racing outfit. His helmet is much larger with a white google like visor, similar to those worn by older Hoth Troopers. It doesn't flip up like his companion, instead his helmet is actually a re-use of the helmet first introduced with the Series 1 Space Man Mini-Figure from LEGO's Collectible Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also has printing on it, his logo, or whatever it is meant to be, sort of reminds me of a Cyote to be honest. His head is also double sided with a regular neutral expression and a determined looking grit-teeth expression opposite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, while the set is slightly underwhelming as far as builds are concerned the playability of the set and the Mini-Figures bump up it's value to me. It would be well worth owning for the Mini-Figures and bikes alone, getting a cheap LEGO trophy piece out of the bargain merely sweetens the deal.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3
"PjtorXmos","2021-05-26T17:47:55.087Z","A forgettable Set with a competently designed shooting function","<p>I&#39;m not one to look back on the &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; themes of this era with resentment, in fact I&#39;m longing for Lego to get bolder again with their original themes.&nbsp;Sure, some might be misses like this one, but you also get hits like Power Miners, Ninjago, ExoForce&nbsp;or Space Police III.</p>

<p>I recently collected this whole theme, to answer my late childhood question: &ldquo;How good are the shooting mechanisms in those?&rdquo;, and the answer is mostly a resounding &ldquo;meh&rdquo;.&nbsp;Let&#39;s maybe start at the builds themselves though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The green bike is a pretty neat overall&nbsp;and I really like, that the designer(s) has/have been thinking a little outside the box for this one. Instead of just throwing in the motorcycle with the cross bike fairing, they came up with a small missile launcher sidecar. The missiles aren&#39;t plain old flick fires either, they actually managed to build a pretty consistent shooting mechanism onto this tiny platform. Sadly the launcher likes to tip forward if you are not careful, but overall, this is a nicely playable model with a competent shooting mechanism (which actually makes it better than most of the theme&#39;s launchers). Now to the lesser of the two bikes....</p>

<p>The black bike is well ... let&#39;s say &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;. The fairing screams &ldquo;slow boomer cruiser&rdquo; way too much and the sticker flames don&#39;t do it many favours either. I&#39;m not really one for those 6 piece minifig motorcycles, but I get that most kids don&#39;t want their fully snotted Lego bikes to fall apart in one touch, but you could have at least made the model a tiny bit more creative and playable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The podium and the snakes are nice additions, but I wonder why there is a third place in a death race with two teams, it always bothered me way more, than it probably should.</p>

<p>The minifigures are pretty standard for the time, nothing very special. One very notable exception are the helmet prints, because Lego actually didn&#39;t cheap out on those, by just putting one layer of white on them. Yes, the white on dark printing in 2010 was better quality than now. &ldquo;Fix yer prints Lego, we don&#39;t need grievous in inconsistent grey tones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overall this is a decent set, if you want something for your kids to play with, this might be something for you. If you are looking at it for the parts, it probably isn&#39;t for you.</p>
