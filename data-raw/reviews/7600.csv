</ul>
<p>&nbsp; i recomend this set but if you really don't like stickers don't buy any world racers sets because any of the cars in the theme just look blah without them.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"jake9","2010-08-28T01:24:13.39Z","Cool cars if you like the Road Warrior","<p>I love LEGO vehicles so I mainly got this set for the cars. One is a quasi open wheel racer; think Formula 1 with rockets and two seats. The other reminds me of the Speed Racer cars. The fenders curve and look very classic-car like.&nbsp;I built them without the rockets, saws, and other weapons because I wanted to see the cars without those add-ons.&nbsp;They are 8 studs wide, and although they look VERY cool, they have little value to add to my city since my cars are all 4 to 6 studs wide. If you like to play Road Warrior then these autos are just right. But don't plan on using them in your city plan. In fairness however, this is not a city set.</p>
<p>These cars have a lot of Technic parts and elements in them; the wheels axles, the rocket action, and other moving parts are all Technic. This adds some complexity to the build but it's satisfying. Additionally, there are lots of stickers. Every decal you see on the autos are stickers. Take what you will with that.</p>
<p>The minifigs are nice too and you get four! They are painted front and back, and their heads are painted on the back too. You get two from each World Racer team.</p>
<p>In all, the cars are look very cool which is why I bought the set. But the scale is off for the rest of my creations.&nbsp;Maybe they would be better for someone who likes to play LEGO Road Warrior! Play well!</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-05T06:02:39.53Z","LEGO World Racers - Wreckage Road Review","This is my second LEGO World Racers set I've got and my first LEGO World Racers set which I've built. Actually it is 30 Euros in Germany but I was able to find it for 20 Euros. The set is fun to put together. It includes 2 drivers for the <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Brickyard Blasters</span> team and the <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Team Extreme</span> team. I really love the overalls and the helmets of the drivers. This set also comes with lot's of stickers which you need to put on. We also get a podium with a nice looking trophy piece.<br><br>The gate which also comes in this set has some lights on the top, and the checkered flag. What surprised me about this flag was that LEGO put a sticker on this piece. In the past we didn't need to put on stickers on checkered flags. On the back of the brick which says 'FINISH' I put an extra sticker.<br><br>The cars which we get are really awsome too. It's really hard to choose my favourite car. The Brickyard Blasters car looks like a cool sports car with a neat v8 engine. On the back we can see the number 13 on the fins which is a little bit weird because I've never seen a motorsports car with a number 13 yet. This vehicle also has a feature to launch harpoon pieces.<br><br>The other car which we get is the IndyCar. First I thought it was a Formula 1 car but I've watched some IndyCar races and then I noticed that this is not a Formula 1 car. It has some cool looking stickers and two places where you can put the minifigs in. The only problem is that there're no pegs on the seats so the figures are a little bit loose in there. This car also has two flick-missiles.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great model and I would highly recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Wolf_99","2010-10-01T21:58:56.88Z","Awesome","this is my 3rd set in the series, I really enjoy both cars, like others I admit that there is a lot of decals, for the F-1 look a like car I suggest starting the top decals with the one with the gauges and align the others one accordingly, nice figurines, so far it's my son's favorite set so far, we are looking forward to set 4, we don't really care if they don't fit with the rest of our city stuff, lego is for imagination, I would really hope that lego comes out with a 3rd team to all sets and sell them as a package, this set could also included a race official. Overall if you like cars even if there is a lot of stickers (if aligned properly looks awesome) this set will pleased.",FALSE,4,5,4,5,4
