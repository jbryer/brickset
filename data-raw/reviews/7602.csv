"starwarsgeek101_","2010-05-24T22:06:12.233Z","All-around Great set","<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>I bought this set at a toys r us for $20 and was extremely happy to get it early. Once you open the box, two bags come out along with a small instruction manuel and a small sticker sheet. The bags are numbered; 1 bag for the catapult and minifigs, and 1 bag for the outpost itself. The sticker-sheet&nbsp;contains two stone-wall stickers which really aren't a big hassle when you apply them. </p>
<h4>The Build&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In bag 1 there are obviously three minifigures, two lion knights, and one dragon knight as well as the catapult. The catapult&nbsp;has a very nice design and also is very stable. The outpost was a&nbsp;simple build,&nbsp;and it&nbsp;doesn't contain much of an interior for the minifigs.&nbsp;One cool feature is that the window on the second level of the outpost can be knocked out&nbsp;when you shoot it with the catapult.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>This set is great for $20, and it is the first time in a while that LEGO has loosened their pricing. The minifigures are great, the catapult is sleek, and the outpost is designed to perfection. I've said enough.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

"aplbomr79","2010-06-23T02:18:35.763Z","Great Tower Set","<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This set is a great addition for any Castle enthusiast.&nbsp; I picked it up at Target for $15usd - that is $.07 ppp! &nbsp;For $15 (usd) you get 3 different castle Mini-figs, a catapult to launch attacks, and a tower to defend! &nbsp;Over the last 4 months I have picked up three of these due to the fact that they greatly add to my armies.</p>
<p>On a nostalgic note, this set reminds me of the power packed into an Original Pirates set, Sabre Island (6265). &nbsp;As with Sabre Island, this set offers so much for so little a price. </p>
<h4>Postives</h4>
<p><b>Catapult</b></p>
<p>The build starts off with the Dragon Knight catapult. It harkens back to the Catapult Crusher (6032).&nbsp; However, this build is much better than the predecessor.&nbsp; It contains the same basic design along with the catapult piece and the wheels.&nbsp; But the build is much simpler in design and seems much more sturdy than the original.&nbsp; The catapult is a big plus - especially when you include the two shields and the heavy shells.</p>
<p><b>The Tower</b></p>
<p>The second part of the build, the Tower, does not disappoint either.&nbsp; I would have liked to see a solid base plate, but the two separate pieces allow for more building possibilities later.&nbsp; It has 3 levels with the top level being the lookout/shot tower.&nbsp; The way that LEGO attached the accompanying crossbow does not allow for much movement, but with a MiniFig up top keeping lookout, you don't need it to move much.&nbsp; The moveable wall on the 2nd story obviously plays into the fact that the catapult is meant to blow it away - but it doesn't really function well in that regard. </p>
<p><b>Other</b></p>
<p>There are only 2 stickers - meant for the corner castle walls.&nbsp; Other than that, all of the graphics are printed on - and they are AMAZING!&nbsp; The Flag, the Shields - they are incredible.&nbsp; They reach back to the old Yellow Lion Castle days of the late '70's and early '80's, but they are distinctly different.&nbsp; This is not a bad thing considering that each Kingdom in Medieval times had their own unique emblems.</p>
<p>The set also includes 5 weapons (4 unique), which aid in the playability and overall functionality of the set.&nbsp; The only thing that seems to be missing is the Bucket Helmet - it would have been a great feature on this set.</p>
<p>Even at $20 this set is well worth the money.&nbsp; Go and get it if you are a Castle fan.&nbsp; And pick up the Knights Showdown for only $7 more - it will expand this set even further.</p>
<h4>Negatives</h4>
<p>I wish that TLG would include shields for the Lion Knights. &nbsp;There are none included in this set. &nbsp;Also - a few more weapons would be nice.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-15T12:56:49.743Z","Defend the Outpost!","<p>Set #7948 Outpost Attack: This marks my 250th Review on Brickset... A benchmark indeed. But this also represents the first large scale Castle set I've picked up since the early 1990's. (and most of those sets are long gone from my collection.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outpost Attack is mine now and so I am one step closer to completing a Theme, at least until the 2011 Kingdoms sets are released. All I have to do is scrounge up enough money to buy Prison Tower Rescue and King's Castle. (Plus I have plans to pick up a second Knight's Showdown.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outpost Attack is a great looking set, it also is the&nbsp;third set I've ever purchased that had indivdually numbered bags for the build/pieces, my first was Bounty Hunter Pursuit, my second was Republic Cruiser and my fourth was LEGO City Camper. This means you won't be mistaking a piece from one bag for the other, or rifling through a mountain of pieces to find that one elusive little 1x1 stud. Unfortunately it suffers from the same problem as most of my larger set purchases the past few months... Curved/Bent/Creased Instructions. I'm beginning to think LEGO should either put the instructions in a seperate cardboard envelope or do something about the sturdiness of their instruction manuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us now start with the build. First up is Bag 1, which includes three Mini-Figures and the Dragon Knight's catapult. This doesn't take too long to build, it features a good number of pieces for a catapult and works really well in launching the projectiles, it rolls on four large brown pieces that represent wheels. It truly looks like something a group of Knights would build up from chopped lumber and such to invade another kingdom. I have three Dragon Knights so far, and all three of them share the same face... Makes you wonder if there's a hidden meaning to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bag 2, the Outpost of the Lion Knights. I enjoyed building this quite immensely, it was very satisfying to me to finally be building something large scale that my Knights Mini-Figures could populate, the Outpost Tower stands up well and has many places to stash some knights, the bottom interrior section is a tad bare, but I put my Wizard and his little pedestal and potion table there now and it looks quite nice. (This is only temporary until I get King's Castle, then he'll migrate over to that.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upper wall section which is designed to fall down after being struck by the Dragon Knight's projectile works, perhaps a little too well, but it works very nicely. When you aim carefully and smash it down you feel as though the knights must scramble to defend their Outpost from the attacking Dragon Knights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The details are really great, and spartan, there are only two stickers for details (mine were slightly creased due to the size of the box.) they add a nice splash of color to the bland stone gray walls, and fortunately the creaseing of the sticker sheet wasn't too severe. Once I got them on they stayed conformed to the piece rather than curling up and peeling off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My current display for Kingdoms is as follows, the two Outpost Attack Lion Knights are maning their outpost, with the Pikeman in the front entrance and the archer up top, on either side of the middle section I've placed the Lion Knight Prisoner from Prison Carriage Rescue (who is weaponless.) and the Crown Knight from the LEGO Castle Impulse set with his spear helping to defend the Lion Knights territory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Knight's Showdown catapult is to the right of the entrance while the Lion Knight who mans it is situated in the center of the Outpost, directly in front of the break-apart wall, he'd better be careful when the Dragon Knights start launching projectiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lion Knight with Armor Printing from Prison Carriage Rescue is on the lowest section on the right facing out to help guard the Outpost, and of course the Wizard and his table and stuff is inside concoting spells and potions to defend the King's domain from the evil Dragon Knights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mention all of this to help get across just how much room there actually is to populate your Outpost with Knights. It is a very good model and I'm hoping that somehow I can incorporate the Outpost itself into the modular build of the King's Castle once I pick that set up... I'll have to wait until I have it in hand to see if there's any room to incorporate this Outpost into the walls of the Castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this is a great fun set with a lot of potential and playability. I strongly recommend it to my fellow LEGO Kingdoms collectors. And any LEGO Castle collectors in general.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Colonel14","2011-01-17T16:42:08.847Z","The Baby Outpost","<p>Another Christmas gift, <strong>Outpost Attack</strong> from the Kingdoms series caught my eye in a catalogue (becuase of it's medium size and low-ish price) so it landed on my Christmas wish list. After contructing it, however, I started to see that the Outpost I saw was nothing like the one in front of me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Build</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was somewhat interesting, mainly becuase TLC didn't use the castle tower piece. The outpost has three floors: the ground floor (which is hard to make at fist since it is looseley held in place), the middle floor, and then the top. The flag at the top of the outpost consists of two streamer pieces, one red and one gold. Another thing nice about the build is the lack of stickers. There are two (the bricks with vines covering them: they look quite nice), and the other bricks with symboles on them are printed on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The catapult is nicely made, even though it is a short, quicky build. I like how they make the spikes on the wheels, using dark green and gold mini slopes. The catapult is functional and launches bicks at the tower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main drawback with the tower is that it is shorter than I expected. Looking at it in the boxart and in real life, you can see the difference. Kinda makes you feel like you were ripped off. Another problem is the window piece. It's very loose and can be quite annoying to keep it in place. I know that it's meant to be knocked out of place by the catapult, but by the time the tower is standing, the window has already fallen off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Parts</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set comes complete with two spears, a bow 'n arrow with an arrow backpack for a minifig, two black axes, two silver knight helmets and one gray helmet. There are&nbsp;three minifigures: two Lion Knights and one Dragon Knight. An interesting piece is the catapult piece becuase it is only one part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Playability</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The playability is hindered because of the tower's small size. You can't have minifigs rush through small cracks that are a lame excuse for a doorway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Value for Money</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: This is one guy's oppinion. If you want the set, by all means buy it. I won't stop you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my oppinion: don't. It's awfuly small and has limited playability. It's an average set, but an average set isn't something you'd like to have around.</p>

Collecting Kingdoms is this also the set you need containing the catapult to help out the Dragon Knights attacking the King's Castle.</p>

<p>Building 4 bricks: pleasant to built, you start with the catapult using the known parts with a good shooting weapon as result. After that the 3 floor tower which also is good to do, the lowest floor is the only one with the big wall parts all the rest is mostly small bricks which I consider still the best. The second floor has a front part with a window standing loose so you can shoot it out. Top floor is like always basic for defending.</p>

<p>Parts 3 bricks: Nothing really special, &nbsp;3 Nice minifigures with sufficient weapons and nice flags and&nbsp;a banner for the tower. I distracted some because actually the set misses one extra Dragon Knight with horse so you can move the catapult. The extra Knight would also be welcome to attack the outpost. A bit bigger ground plate would have been nice too to place a defending knight on.</p>

<p>Playability 5 bricks: Good shooting weapon and a part to shoot out of the Tower and 3 knights to fight eachother. When you destroyed&nbsp;the outpost&nbsp;you finally are able to move the catapult to the King's Castle and assist to besiege it.</p>

"Snowtrooper119","2011-11-24T03:12:28.09Z","A good set, but not fantastic","<p>This set got my interest in castle back. I saw it on the shelves and something clicked in my head and I decided to buy it. It is too expensive which is always a good thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>In this set you get two lion knights and one dragon knight. The lion knights have an archer and a guy with a spear. They are stock standard but good army builders. The dragon knight has an overused face and a very standard torso but is the only dragon knight to carry a torch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The catapult</h4>
<p>Is very sturdy and has a nice design. It looks cool and looks very solid. The shields on the side are a nice touch but are not secured very well and will move easily if bumped. The&nbsp;dragon knight&nbsp;colours look good on the catapult and it has a nice mix of dark green and brown with a gold touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The tower</h4>
<p>Is quite a simple, but enjoyable build and features a spot for the crossbow on top, a flag and battlements. There is also a wall that when the catapult hits, or is knocked will fall over. It doesn't have much space anywhere but it looks pretty good for the amount of pieces contained. At the back there is no wall and therefore it looks a bit weird from behind but that is understandable. The base has two decorative axes attached and the angular walls have stickers but they are easy to apply and stick easily.&nbsp;The red touches and the flag really finish off the set and makes it fit in well next to the king's castle. </p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This is a good set with good pieces and reasonable minifigures. It is not too expensive but is not a necassary set unless you are a fan of castles.

"tvih","2012-06-13T18:07:32.75Z","Catapult fun!","<p>Here's a fun little set where the catapult steals the show from the title structure, the Outpost!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box serves its purpose, showing the contents of the set via a few scenes, and listing the mini figures. As usual it's a bit oversized.</p><p>Instructions are clear and easy to understand, as usual.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set doesn't have a huge amount of parts, but still enough for the price. Not too many special bricks or anything, but whether that's a good or bad thing is subjective.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Included are three mini figures, two Lion soldiers and one Dragon soldier. Unfortunately the Lions don't get any shields. The Dragon gets two, though they are meant for the catapult - but obviously they can be used otherwise, as well.

I was a bit surprised that the surfaces of the ""corner blocks"" as seen on the pictures were stickers, and ended up not using them, at least yet.</p><p>There aren't really any special techniques or such used, so the whole process was pretty standard-fare,</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed outpost looks nice, but it's a bit lacking in functionality. There's basically no space inside it to stage a battle. You can put figures to stand in the middle balcony, but not sideways as to depict a duel or such going on. Then again with no visible means of going up the tower, it might seem strange anyway! The middle window and its mounting can be knocked loose, but that's about it for special things.</p><p>For playability's sake I also would've hoped that the crossbow mount at the top of the tower would've had some sort of ""leaning"" mechanism to allow aiming downwards.</p><p>But the real fun with this set is the catapult.

It would've been easy, after all. Even now at my older age, I can't help but think how fun it'd be to do Angry Bird-esque floor games, just with Legos. Catapult, loose bricks as cover...
