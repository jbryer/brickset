"The_Guy_With_The_Bricks","2010-05-21T11:19:17.59Z","Excellent introduction to the Kingdoms line","The LEGO ""architecture"" represented in this set shows a dramatic departure from the previous Castle fantasy offerings.

Dedicated Lego Castle fans who enjoy the unique designs and colors of these sets shouldn't hesitate to buy both sets!<br><br>The one incredibly strange thing to me is that these two sets, so perfectly aligned in color, architecture, and overall feel, should have one major difference- the baseplate colors are different! As I noted in <a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html"">my review of Escape from the Dragon's Prison,</a> the sets are identical in look except for this one thing, which breaks the continuity when they are placed side-by-side.

"tppytel","2011-08-10T22:05:02.023Z","Good concept, but needs expansion and modification","It's strange that I give all the subratings 4's, and then only judge the set a 3 overall. But this set feels like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">less</span> than the sum of its parts and misses a lot of opportunities for excellence. The basic concept (knights fighting through a multi-level fortress to save the princess) is obviously a classic, and even has a pretty good start here. But a $50 set has a high enough part count that it should do a solid job executing its vision, and this set just doesn't get there. <br><br>What's good here? Plenty, really, but always with too much room for improvement. There's a solid selection of minifigs, including the all-important princess. But considering that this is the best fortress the Dragon Knights have, the lack of a Dragon leader is a serious omission. Now that the Escape from Dragon's Prison set is out, the big bad knight from that set will serve that role well. But there should have been something here in the first place. Using the old knight face for the Lion Knight is strange as well - he should be training youngsters in the yard, not rescuing princesses! Easily fixed, but an odd choice nevertheless. At least the princess is well done. And another barded horse is always welcome, even if the white printing on the red part comes out rather pinkish.<br><br>The basic concept of the set is quite good too, but again fails in execution. The stairways in the back give a nice feeling of ascending walkways for the knights to battle on, which is great. But the prison cell door doubling as a ladder seems really strange - why doesn't the captive princess just push down the ladder and walk out while everyone is asleep? This kind of thing wouldn't bother me in a $20 set, but I expect a better implementation of the theme in a $50 set. More importantly, the entire left side of the fortress is total nonsense. There's already a perfectly good gate - why is there a stairway facing forward, barred by a completely ridiculous ladder piece? This is a really egregious design flaw, as it not only makes no sense, but takes up a lot of pieces and a lot of interior space that could be better used. Given the many clever building twists elsewhere in the set, it's hard to understand why this part of the design is so poor.<br><br>Others have complained that the fortress isn't ""solid"" enough, but I disagree with that. While substantial, this set isn't a 1000-piece flagship - there are only so many bricks to go around. The designers chose to use the pieces to go taller (supporting the multi-level fighting theme) rather than expand walls horizontally. That's a fine choice, I think. The problem is that because of that stupid front staircase, the set doesn't create any illusion of an interior. If that part were better designed, the set as a whole wouldn't feel as ""thin"" as it does.<br><br>Finally, there's a decent part selection here for castle builders. But again, something doesn't feel quite right about the color scheme. Black and brown don't go so well together, and that's most of what this set uses. I think the overall look would've been a lot snappier had the designers used more dark grey instead in order to make the fortress look like something solidly built on a rocky outcropping rather than a hastily erected set of battlements and barricades.<br><br>Overall, I'd expect most dedicated Kingdoms fans will find this set worthwhile between the princess, other minifigs, and basic parts. Otherwise, it really depends how much you're willing to modify the set. There are some fine design ideas and building techniques here, but making this set what it should be will require rebuilding most of it and probably tweaking the colors significantly with new bricks. If you're up for that, this set is a fine start. But if you're more into building complete sets as designed, I'd pass on this.<br><br>",TRUE,3,4,4,4,4
"siege","2011-03-10T16:51:34.633Z","Har, har. You'll never get the princess. Hey, come back with her!","When i first saw the kingdoms theme, I was like ""w000t, me is want!!"". I got this set first just after the release, and I can say: kingdoms didn't let me down!<br>Lets start!<br>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>First impressions, the box! I have to say, I just love the artwork sooooo much. It was the first thing that grabbed my attention. it really makes want to walk down the landscape.<br>The instructions. What to say about it? They're instructions. They're clear, good contrast between the colors. Not much to say about.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4>you get the parts in 4 plastic bags with numbers on them. One number for one part of the build. The part selection is prett good I have. You get some nice parts to start MOCing your own castle and plenty of weapons.<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>Let's move on to the minifigs! You get:<br>-The royal lion knight on his trusty white steed: armed with a sword and a kiteshield. The armor looks amazing detailed. I only wonder why he has this old man head. Kinda weird for a damsel-rescuer IMO. Horse has armor and unicorn helmet.<br>-The lion soldier: armed with a spear. Hes yer typical bearded soldier. Nice detailed chest. Not much to say about.<br>-The princess: Quite a nice princess. Red long hair, double-sided face, happy and distress. She has this dress printed on her chest, belly and back. her legs are composed of this dress-printed slope piece, which makes her look weirdly high compared to the knights.<br>-the dragon knight: armed with a spear and a shield. He's quite bad-ass. I love his printed chest armor, squared dark and light green, with a chain as belt. And off course the buckethelmet.<br>-The dragon crossbowman: armed with (who could have guessed) a crossbow! I again love his armor printing: scalemail. My first dark-steel crossbow, yay! The thing I miss on this guy is a quiver.<br>
<h4>The build</h4>The build is easy. No oversized parts! No weird constructions and the instructions are clear. You start with the base. 4 flat pieces are your floor. Walls on top of it. Some stairs beside it. Which is really weird. Then you get the little side tower besides the big one, which you have to build after that. Put some awesome dragons underneath the windows, after that put a knot on the portcullis, which is kinda hard IMO.<br>Just above the portcullis you get 3 flat 4x6 pieces, with on top the prison with some battlements in front of it. On top of that more battlements with a cauldron with flames and the mighty dragon flag.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The tower looks really satisfactory when finished. Something that is little weird in the tower are the stairs besides the main gate. Who the hell would put a stair there? Block it off, okay. But not with a ladder, thats weird. The flat part on top of the tower with the prison on top of it also looks a bit weird.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4>I don't regret getting this set at all. It is the 55 euros worth. You get a good looking tower, some amazing minifigs and a chance to play your own heroic damsel in distress scene...(again?). If your into (retro) knights and things like that, don't hestitate to get this old charmer.<br><br>English ain't my native language and this is my first review. *cheer*<br>Please leave a comment via the contact form on how to improve my reviews.<br>And don't forget to click usefull or unusefull.<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4

"Harmonious_Building","2012-04-20T21:54:10.69Z","The princess IS in this castle. ","The 2010-11 Dragon Knights are among the most understated Castle antagonists of all time, but they do, at least, have a flagship building to call their own, which is much more that can be said for the poor the Bull Knights, who are forced to sleep under their <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6096-1"">war machines</a> if they want to keep out of the rain. Anyway, Prison Tower Rescue is a tall and rigid - if slightly chaotic - dungeon/castle hybrid built as a single structure on a set of connecting flat plates, giving it a very “classic” feel compared to the more modern modular-type builds. With a healthy complement of Minifigs and a lot of great play features, Prison Tower Rescue feels like a throwback to the Castle sets of yore, and all in a good way, I might add.<br><br>Prison Tower Rescue features a broad and generous assortment of Minifigs: two Lion Knights, two Dragon Knights, and a fair maiden, who is exclusive to this set and therefore highly desirable if you’re looking to add variety to your medieval scene. I have little doubt that she is meant to be paired up with the Lion Knights king, possibly as her daughter/the princess, or I suppose she could be interpreted as a peasant woman in need of rescuing if that so catches your imagination.<br><br>The knights are of decent variety. You get one of the new helmets apiece for each faction and a more generic foot soldier to help out the leader. The Lion Knights also get an awesome horse for charging the gates; for some reason I’m a sucker for the Castle horse accessories so I love the horse, er, cover and the “unicorn” adornment. The Dragon Knights, unfortunately, don’t fare quite as well: not only does the Dragon Knight captain come unarmoured, but the crossbowman doesn’t even have a quiver! A brief sojourn to BrickLink can solve that easily enough, but honestly, how this set ever shipped without at least one quiver is mysterious to me.<br><br>There are no other odds and ends besides the Minifigs and the prison tower itself, but it’s hard to be disappointed by that because of how unexpectedly large the tower is. In fact, the funny thing about this build is that it doesn’t feel like it’s going anywhere until the very end, which is quite unlike many contemporary sets that break larger sets up into several smaller components. There are some slight allusions to the Dragon Knights of the past, meaning that the tower is meant to look as though it is built in a very naturalistic setting, although nowhere near as extreme as the Dark Dragon’s Den (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6076-1"">6076</a>), for example. Fortunately, BURPs are completely absent from this build, with the tower opting for use of (relatively) simpler pieces instead, which is nice.<br><br>Some of the features of the prison tower include a classic string-operated front gate (as opposed to the fancy “look ma, no strings” mechanism in King’s Castle (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7946-1"">7946</a>)), a teeny-weeny side catapult for pelting would-be invaders, and a “cauldron” at the very top of the tower for raining hot death upon annoying do-gooders. There’s also a couple of nooks and crannies for hiding treasure and so forth, which is cool if you prefer to imagine Dragon Knights as bandits more than a full-fledged invading force. There’s a fair amount of open space both inside and outside of the tower, which is perfect for placing crossbow knights or for hiding the Wizard (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7955-1"">7955</a>) and his occult ways.<br><br>If I had to dock this great set for anything, it would probably be for its weird use of plates as its foundation as opposed to using a straight-up baseplate. I suppose it’s a highly subjective opinion, but I find that the bottom plates fall out a little easily in transportation because of the strange way in which they are configured. I guess there’s arguments either way (including expense on LEGO’s part which might have found its way to the consumer), but I feel that the prison tower could have benefited from a baseplate because of its build. Again, this is not something that can’t be easily rectified by BrickLink or some other source, and I realise that it is strictly a matter of taste that does vary from LEGO fan to LEGO fan.<br><br>Finally, the prison tower has great synthesis with Escape from the Dragon’s Prison (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7187-1"">7187</a>), both in terms of scale and in terms of aesthetics; displaying both of these sets together is just a natural thing to do.<br><br>So, if you’re the kind of person who likes to be sure that the bad guys have a home, Prison Tower Rescue is a great set to have and a worthy addition to any Castle collection. The strange architecture might be a turn-off for some, but I think it looks great. There are a few minor oversights, but I’m sure that these are forgivable enough for grown-ups and kids alike to enjoy in the end. <br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Ernst","2011-12-29T17:07:09.857Z","Small Castle or large dungeon ? Either way a good set.","<p><strong>Overall 5 stars:</strong> it is very recognizeable being the bad guys hangout. A nice building with both good and bad guys and a Princess. Good concept and simply a good set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building experience 5 stars</strong>: not difficult but not the easiest of sets too. A good amount of both big and small parts so you really have to &quot;built&quot; it. Result is a solid building with a good working fence and nicely functioning extra defence weapons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 stars:</strong> I gave almost 5 stars but like always some things good be improved or added. The pro&#39;s are the present minifigures, including the Princess the big Castle misses, although a leading Dragon Knights horseman would have been welcome. The building is ok, the weapons good with a bonus remark for the fireboiler. A gate or door for the prison would have been welcome, now you have to use the stairs as a fence. Lovely small dragon ornaments !</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 stars</strong>: all in order here. Even without the extra desired Dragon Knight you can built a great adventure with this set, very good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for money 4 stars</strong>: I consider &euro;50,00 just a bit overrated, 10 euro&#39;s less would have been better in my opinion or some extra parts added.</p>
