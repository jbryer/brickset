"The_Brick_Show","2010-05-27T23:33:24.903Z","Great Castle with a Worthy King","I'm a big medieval fan so this was a fun build for me. I'd say the $99.99 USD price point is right where it should be. Getting the 8 mini figures and a castle with the movable drawbridge and gate are the top selling points. The Red King mini figure is one of the best I've seen. His gold sword, gold crown and decorative breastplate along with his decorated white horse is a really special fig.<br><br>The hidden prison is a nice touch and the extra weapons (mace, few swords) is also an added bonus. The better playability format is to line it all up on a wide format (shows you how in the instructions).<br><br>Here is our video review:<br><br><a href=""http://www.brickshow.com/episode44-7946"">http://www.brickshow.com/episode44-7946</a><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"sudorum","2010-06-03T18:32:53.123Z","Good, but with the usual faults","This set has an appearance that appears to harken back to the old days of lego castle. The front gate and the back tower with the red top is quite similar to those castles of yesteryear. Sadly, this set is still like modern lego castles, in that there is no interior other than the table you place it on. The entire center is empty, just like the troll castle and the other king' s castle. Nevertheless, there are good components to the set. There is a raising drawbridge, a very unique gate lifting function, and new minifigures. I don't have to mention the catapults, as every castle set comes with them. Also included is a very small prison in the back of the castle, a treasure chest, and king's throne in the larger tower. Overall a pretty good castle. Lego appears to be on the right track.",FALSE,4,4,5,3,4
"nicker94","2010-07-07T21:53:07.25Z","The Lego castle I have been waiting over 10 years for!","<p>This set is the first castle set to have a proper gatehouse in over 10 years! I really like the overall look of this set. I am a fan of the 80s and early 90s castle sets and this one reminds me mostly of set 6080 Kings Castle even though there are a few differences. I have been waiting to see a proper gatehouse on a castle set again and I got it with this one. I like the fact that the drawbridge has arms much like 7094 Kings Castle Siege. The only thing I would have changed would be to have the arms raise into the main part of the tower where they would retract back into a recess in the wall and not have them exposed on either side of the gatehouse. This castle includes a dungeon that can be access through a removable hatch on the exterior wall. The interior also includes a weapons rack and a place for the horse to eat. <br />
<br />
I really like the fact that the set is made up of several modular sections that can be snapped together and rearranged in several different ways. These modular sections are divided up very logically compared to some past sets. It would be great to see other sets designed in the same modular fashion so they could all be combined into one large castle. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another minor design aspect I didn't really like was the fact that the towers at the back of the castle are very open and exposed with very little of no walls or battlements to enclose them. I am guessing this was done on purpose in order to make it easier for children to reach in to play with the set which is always part of a fine balance when designing a new set. I find the color scheme to be very refreshing change and integrates well with the design of the set. One thing that I would like to see is more knights on horseback included with sets. For years there only ever seems to be one horse included with large castle sets now which I find disappointing. I also think that the 3 dragon knights included with the set should have been lion knights to fill out the defending ranks inside the castle more. If people wants the opposing dragon knights faction for attacking then let them buy a dragon knights set.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
    <li>This set has a <span style=""font-weight: bold"">proper</span> gate house.</li>
    <li>The set has a nice modular design.</li>
    <li>Nice asymmetrical design.</li>

    <li>Could have used more than one knight on horseback.</li>
    <li>Undesirable placement of arms for drawbridge.</li>

"birgoyle","2010-06-06T02:40:21.873Z","Yet another castle...","I really like the way that LEGO has gone with their new Kingdoms line. Going back to its simple roots. Unfortunately in Australia this set was $169.95 ($140 US, 116 EUR) so it scores low in the value for money. <br><br>This castle is smaller than I expected, being a little smaller than 7094 King's Castle Siege. The details more than make up for the size though, 7094 pretended to be a modular castle but failed, due to the positions of the links between walls, but this castle pulls it off well. As mentioned in previous review, the instructions show how to make it into 3 different designs. <br><br>I agree with the previous reviewer that the castle is still lacking in the courtyard space, as it comes with no baseplate, or any structure inside the walls. And I have to add that the sparse towers are disappointing, while better than 7094, they still leave something to be desired. <br><br>That being said, I am extremely impressed with the level of detail on the minifigs. The Lion King is exquisite, forgoing the usual non-printed torso under a chest-plate. His torso is so well designed you may want to keep his chest-plate off. The same can be said for the Dragon knight with the brilliant cross-helm. I think I can safely say these are the most detailed castle figs ever. Same for the Horse's armour &amp; barding<br><br>The only disappointing thing about the minifigs is that this castle, the showpiece of the new line, does not come with a Lion Knight. It has a King, 2 lance wielders, and 2 archers, but no Knight. I find this puzzling. <br>A bit off topic, but only 2 Lion Knights are available, in the Prison Carriage Rescue and Prison Tower. While a Dragon Knight comes in this set, the Dragon battle pack, the Prison Tower, and the Knight's Showdown. So, 4 Dragon Knights, 2 Lion Knights. Strange. <br><br>Pros:<br>Exquisite minifigs<br>Unique portcullis raising device<br>Horse &amp; Barding<br><br>Cons:<br>Lack of interior<br>No Lion Knight<br><br>I look forward to seeing if LEGO will expand this line!<br>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,3

"natro220","2010-11-22T11:59:36.577Z","Best castle set in a long long time","<p>Being an AFOL, I collected castle sets when I was younger, growing up building the Black Monarch's Castle and King's Mountain Fortress.&nbsp; This was the first castle set I had the urge to buy since my younger days, and I was very glad I did.</p>
<p>The instructions are broken down into 8 sections (in 3 different books), and each section has its own polybag of parts.&nbsp; This makes building much more enjoyable, and younger builders won't feel discouraged by having to dig through nearly 1000 pieces all at once.</p>
<p>There were some very interesting pieces included, such as the large lion piece that goes right above the drawbridge.&nbsp; While some people have complained about the lack of a baseplate, I enjoyed the flexiblity that provided in the build.&nbsp; If I felt like it, I could build out the castle walls to make a longer front facing wall, or&nbsp;build on the edges.&nbsp; While the old mountain baseplates provided a cheap way to make your castle seem imposing and bigger while bringing down the number of pieces used, I realize now that it really limited what one could do without that constraint.</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Good variety of minifigures, including King (missing from most of the older castle sets) 
<li>Flexible build 
<li>Large number of light gray pieces 
<li>Good variety of rare pieces, such as the lion piece, the gate, horse barding, weapons 
<li>Build divided into 8 parts, each with an individually sorted polybag.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>

<li>Stickers - they do add to the overall look (the bricks around the windows, and the vines on the walls are all stickers) so they are recommended.&nbsp; Also, none go over multiple pieces, so that is a plus.

"jatonaz","2010-12-27T07:07:14.62Z","The whole is much better than its parts.","<p><strong>Overall:<br/></strong>The King Castle: a mainstay in every Lego Castle subtheme. Along with carriage, drawbridge, small quarrel, etc... you get the idea. Needless to say, we as consumers and fans are going to compare these repackaged sets, and after being spoiled by the great 7094 King's Castle Siege, this new Kingdom castle didn't seem like much. Add on the fact that it was modular (I admit 7094 was modular too, but look at 7097 and 6242...awful), and I was ready to splurge on loose Fantasy Era minifigures instead of this set. A sale price of 6X USD (after shipping to my country for about 15 USD, good for a saving of at least 25 USD off the local price) made me give in. I guess the reason I'm saying all this is because I believe a lot of people are fans of Castle, not Kingdom, a subtheme so throwback (well, anything is throwback after Fantasy) it's just begging for comparisions to our wonderful childhood Crusader vs. Dragon Kight sets, and I too had this unfair sentimental bias in mind when looking at Kingdom. So if you're that AFOL who's still thinking about skipping this castle or theme as a whole, I hope this review can help you decide whether or not you should really do that.</p>
<p><strong>Minifigs/Parts: <br/></strong>The 2010 Kingdom line brought us the bucketheads, unicorns, and some new castle building pieces. The unicorns come in three different colors, and this is the only set that offers the golden unicorn. Also, the King's Horses' armor is unique, different from the knight's in 7947. The king himself is great, amazing armor that'd make the 7079 Gold Knight proud. His soldiers are what they are, and chances are you have a couple of them already. Oh, and there are NO Lion Knights. You know that already, but this is the first tier-one castle set I've seen without His Highness's No.1 man. Big big negative in my book. The Dragon Knight leader has the only ""Dragon""armor available in sets, the only place else you can get it is in the China made battlepacks. I don't mind China-made that much, but some people do, so he might be amazing to you. Overall the King and his galliant steed slightly makes up for the fact they only gave EIGHT men for a 99.99 castle set. They can't even guard all the towers with four soldiers. And just three Dragon invaders almost makes them look like the out-of-place Wolfpack prisoner/ghost we got back in the days. At least give them a chance with a siege weapon like what Cedric the Bull got in 6098/6091. </p>
<p>Parts-wise, you get a lot of the new castle walls, roof slopes, the portcullis, a good amount of weapons/flags/shields, and an acceptable amount of stickers. Everything else the castle fan has already seen before. Okay set to get for MOC pieces, featuring light greys, assorted red slopes and some green plates . </p>
<p><strong>Building Experience:<br/></strong>I'll break it down into parts, as numbered in the instruction booklet.</p>
<p>Main Gate/Drawbridge: The portcullis is the star here. Nothing you haven't built in a castle before, but the new piece allows for actual knob-turning mechanism, a great improvement over the King's Castle Siege set. We also get a couple of the new castle wall piece --- no more 1X1 brick in the lower corners, which I think is both good and bad, depending on your MOCing abilities.</p>
<p>Gate Tower: Another build we've all done before, brings back memory of 7079. New wall pieces lined with sticker next to the lion statue piece simply looks majestic. Gold and red flag match extremely well. Again, much improved over 7094, matching the gate standards of sets like 6085 Black Monarch's Castle and 6086 Black Knight's Castle. However, the inside is extremely weird --- why is there a table with drink, but no platform for anyone to stand on? Why put a drink there in the first place? Therefore I moved it to the inside of the side towers, to provide provision for the soldiers.</p>
<p>Side Towers: The repeat-build mini towers on the side were okay, consisting of a green octagon plate as base and a grey one as floor for the tower.Built to allow provisions/weapons/soldiers to be stored, this studded space is something I found the previous couple castles to be missing. No more buckets of weapons in the middle of nowhere or hanging on to that one stud! On the other hand, really&nbsp;cruddy mini catapults (The Lions always get the mini ones, the Dragons have awesome catapults), and the height of the towers are puzzling. Measuring in at just over horse rider height, I fail to see how these towers would prevent anyone from getting in. Modification definitely needed, at least one more tower of the same size stacked on, although I currently have a hard time finding octagon plates that large.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Side Walls: Repeat build again. Nothing you haven't seen before. Bucket and shelf of weapons. A pail of some food? Again, the height of these walls amuse me. Good thing the dragon knights don't have a horse rider yet.</p>
<p>Cannon Tower: This is where the main firepower comes from? Round four-studder catapult sits on top of a closed room with nothing in it. Praises for leaving room at ground level, but again nothing special.Throne and Treasure Tower: This part caught my eye when I first saw the box, and it lived up to my expectations. It's three stories tall, the floor room the same as the rest of the other towers. The second room bears resemblence to the cannon tower, with a treasure chest inside it. The third floor is the throne room, with a throne that faces the back of the castle... don't know why, it's easily modified, but still a weird setup. The roof is majestic, a throwback to the King Leo days that we don't see enough now. Really wished this had been the King's quarters, but that can be taken care of. Best part of the rather bland build.</p>
<p>Prison/Back Wall: Just a wall with removable piece behind the prison. Compared to 7094's great back gate this is really unsatisfactory and uninspiring. Oh well, at least they gave a stair piece. </p>
<p><strong>Playability: <br/></strong>Definitely good set for kids. A lot of things they can do, but I do recommend getting at least a Dragon battlepack or the smaller sets in the Kingdom line to even the odds. No knights and steeds make the adventure less believable. That is what prevents me from giving a full five stars. If you have other Kingdom sets, then bump the rating up. </p>
<p><strong>Price:<br/></strong>The good ol' $99.99 USD is acceptable for this set. Definitely not enough minifigs, but some big pieces and a truly great King. If you can find it for $85 or under then don't hesitate. The thing about this set, though, like I've mentioned in the last paragraph, is on its own it's not truly fully playable. For really good fun, then the price tag is actually at least $10~15 higher.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:<br/></strong>As you can see, I made a lot of comparsions to older castle sets, and from the looks of it this castle lucked out. However, I must say that even though I was not thrilled while building, I was very satisfied with the complete product. That's what this set really is. It's a little bit of everything that we AFOLs liked in the Castle theme, and the designers gave us what they could with a $99.99 (at almost the universally accepted 10 cents per piece) price tag. It's flawed and smaller than I'm used to for a main castle, but it's got everything a kingdom needs (except soldiers). The modular build didn't ruin this set, and the use of a green ground floor somewhat offset the third $99.99 set we got in a row without a baseplate. As I titled my review, the whole castle looks much better when it's finished. </p>
<p>To parents, this is a set that your kids will be glad you got them (or allowed them to spend allowance on) when they enter AFOL age. <br/>To long time fans of the Castle theme like me, you won't regret this buy, because it's going to go great with everything you own.<br/>To people who are just getting started on the Castle/Kingdom theme, get some smaller sets first, cause with just this set you'll be a bit lacking in some catagories, and </p>
<p>that's no fun.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"Harmonious_Building","2011-04-26T19:57:52.467Z","One of the best-looking castles in recent years.","The King's Castle is the mainstay of the Kingdoms line, a magnificent fort that must, against all odds, stand against the might of the opposing Dragon Knights faction. Does it do the job?<div><br></div><div>Aesthetically, King's Castle is extremely attractive: there's enough symmetry to make it look orderly, but enough variety to keep it from being boring. The only two sections that are exact mirror-image copies of each other are the two short turrets on either side of the main gate, but LEGO did such a good job of having ""round"" turrets as opposed to perpendicular ones that it doesn't matter to me. Even the side walls have minor variations that keep them from being exactly the same. Finally, the back two towers are completely different from each other; in a vein similar to that of the Royal Knights' Castle (which draws inevitable comparisons from me since I own both), one side is a mess hall/general barracks area for the soldiers and the other side is where the king resides.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Like many of the more recent castles, King's Castle eschews use of a baseplate and instead opts for modularity, which greatly increases the flexibility in terms of display. If you keep the castle in its recommended arrangement, you'll find that there's plenty of open space in the middle for you to reach in and place your Minifigs, so there's no worry about knocking things over in the process. Of particular note is the gate mechanism, a clever design that allows you to raise and lower the portcullis without needing to mess around with string. Strangely, this design was not kept for Prison Tower Rescue.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I have only two minor gripes with this set, both of them stemming from (perhaps unfair) comparisons to the Royal Knights' Castle. The first - an easily fixable one - is that the king's throne seems to face backwards in the final build, which seems a bit aloof to me. The second is that I think that this set could have done with a Minifig or two more; Royal Knights' Castle came with 11, while King's Castle comes with 8, of which 3 are from the Dragon Knights faction. True, Royal Knights' Castle is larger, but it does seem a little strange that the entire castle holds only one horseman - the king himself! The champion from Prison Tower Rescue will invariably be pressed into service here.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, although the set is impressive on its own due to its completeness, it is somewhat lacking in height. At first I thought that this was yet another unfair comparison to its big brother 6090, but even Prison Tower Rescue is taller than the main gate. Fortunately, now you have a use for those skinnier cardboard boxes from Amazon that you've been saving this whole time.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

Here in Indonesia, the price is around USD 150, and I can not make my wife to approve the buying:)<br><br>So, when someone offered a used set priced at around USD 80, I quickly decided to buy it. And that is one of decisions that I will never regret. Just finished the building last night, and this set is really look amazing. The details they have, the torches (which done by creatively combining trans red plumes and telescopes), the flags. Oh what a really grand castle it is.&nbsp; The building process took around 3 hours (I did it while watching The Walking Dead series), but the process itself was not boring at all. A couple of repetition occurred, but in general, it's a fun building time. <br><br>This set come with 8 minifigs : 5 Lion Knights as the inhabitants of the castle and 3 Dragon Knights serves as attackers.

Knight also cool, especially the one using armor. But we need more than 8 minifigs for this scenario. How come a three people attackers hoping to capture a castle? It just felt like wasting time. And they even do not have any heavy artillery. Only some swords and some arrows. Probably this Dragon Knights only work as scouts, trying to find the castle weaknesses? And they probably will find that the back wall of the castle can be opened, so their full scale army can attack through that hole?<br><br>One detail that I also love from this set is the two halberds in the front side of the castle. Really look cool there. Nicely done!<br><br>The only weakness from this set for me is the height. Sure it will look great when it standing by itself. But try to put it next to Medieval Market Village, the castle will look tiny. Probably Lego should considering creating a Castle with the same spirit like this set, only make it larger so it can be comparable with Medieval Market Village.<br><br>Anyway, this set is really should owned by avid Castle fans. But even if you are not fans, you still will be happy to own this set.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

This set in particular has 8 bags. The build was unchallenging, but it took me a nice chunk of time just because of the 900+ pieces the set has.

I would have liked to see one more character with a little more personality in place of one of the two Lion archers, maybe a full sword knight to counter the Dragon sword knight, or a wizard or princess or queen. As is, the figs detract from playability by being so bland. </span>3/5</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Parts</b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">The set has some nice pieces, like the new-ish wall segments that are a sleeker replacement of their 1990's counterparts.

"Sauron_Bauglir","2012-05-23T19:57:10.22Z","An Amazing Castle! The Best Castle Yet...","<p>In my review of King's Castle Siege (7094), I said that it would be hard for this, the 2010 King's Castle, which was about to be released, to beat. But 7094 was beaten! This is the greatest castle Lego has built... so far. It won't be too hard, though, for The Battle of Helm's Deep (9474) to beat this set... Helm's Deep looks even better!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>As with most Lego boxes nowadays, the box for King's Castle is way too big. But it does look good though. 6/10.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Ok parts, but not really any rare ones. The castle building tends to use a lot of grey and red pieces and not any creative building&nbsp;techniques. 6/10.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has 8 excellent figures:</p><p><b>King of the Lion Kingdom- </b>One of my favourite Lego figures of all time!&nbsp;Definitely&nbsp;the best King Lego has ever made. Excellently armed, the only problem is that he could easily trample the entire Dragon Knight army. 10/10!!</p><p><b>Lion Pikeman 1- </b>I tend to love Pikemen, and this is my favourite! He is the one standing on the drawbridge in the picture. He could also single-handedly fend off the Dragon Knight army. 9.5/10.</p><p><b>Lion Pikeman 2- </b>This pikeman is standing on the Castle wall in the picture. He isn't as good as the other Pikeman, but is still cool. 7.5/10.</p><p><b>Lion Crossbowman 1- </b>Not the best Crossbowman. A bit boring, but serves it's purpose (As with the others, taking out the Dragon Knights easily). 5/10.</p><p><b>Lion Crossbowman 2- </b>The Same as the other one, apart from the face. 5/10.</p><p><b>Dragon Knight- </b>A definite leader for the Dragon Knights, very well armed, this guy stands a slight chance. He was the leader of all of my Dragon Knights until I got the horseman from Escape From the Dragon's Prison (7187).</p><p><b>Dragon Spearman- </b>An average soldier in the Dragon Knight's army. Not that interesting. 5.5/10.</p><p><b>Dragon Crossbowman- </b>Someone who could actually do something against the Lion Knights with his weapon. Not a very good figure though. 6.5/10.</p><p><b>Overall- </b>Some <i>very </i>good figures, as well as some boring ones.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Rather long and repetitive. It took me between 1-3 hours on Christmas Day. It would take longer though if it wasn't Christmas. 6/10.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>An excellent castle and brilliant base for the Lion Knights. But the Dragon Knights... all they can do is get their crossbowman to fire at the Lion Knights, and hope that they come out of their stronghold one at a time to fight. The Dragon Knights <b>need </b>some siege equipment, or at least some more archers.&nbsp;Very good castle though. 7/10.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>An excellent set, that needs fairer armies. I suggest combining all your Lego Kingdoms sets into a massive Kingdom, and having a big battle. All the Dragon Knights together would&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;stand a chance. This castle also looks brilliant in the middle of a Medieval city that you can build with the rest of Lego Kingdoms. 9/10.<br><br>If you have a choice between this and King's Castle&nbsp;Siege&nbsp;(7094), buy this. But if you would rather wait for The Battle of Helm's Deep (9474)... buy Helm's Deep!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Ernst","2011-12-29T16:13:10.943Z","The King's Castle 6080 rebuild.","<p>Overall 5 stars: this is simply a good Castle, just like 6080 was a good one. Allthough it is not really an original if you put it next to its older brother, but good is good ! Lego did a good job improving it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building experience 3 stars: you have to built it in components that click together and it is a bit repeating work because several components are the same. The final result is a solid castle with a good drawbridge and fence. Nice details are the red roofs, the inside stairs, the dungeon, the King's room with trone&nbsp;and the treasurechamber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts get 3 stars: generaly all seems present but I miss some things.&nbsp;One real big flag instead of banners&nbsp;for the main tower would have been nice. The castle is well defended with the King and 4 Knights so what are the odd's for the Dragon Knights ? At least one horse-man and a catapult would have been welcome considering the setprice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 stars: although the Dragon Knights are the losers before starting it is very playable. The big and small catapults work fine, you can lock up the prisoners etc. Lego invites you to buy other sets for a real battle (which I did).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money 3 stars: I hesitated for 4 but the lack of enough Dragon Knights was the reason to put it on 3. If you pay €100,00 for a set like this you may expect sufficient minifigures and extra's for an honest battle.</p>
