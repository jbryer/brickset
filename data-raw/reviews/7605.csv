"starwarsgeek101_","2010-05-24T22:20:54.31Z","Splendid Set!","<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>This set was $6, and in it you get 50 parts, 3 minifigures, and a new-style horse. The minifigures are absolutely sweet and sleek, and the prisoner's face is reversable, meaning that you can turn his head 180 degrees, and a new face design appears. The horse also has a decent new design that is nice.</p>
<h4>The Build</h4>
<p>This comes in one bag and it is a very quick build, around 10 minutes. The design of the cart is great, except that there is almost no way to sit the captive down. You also cannot have him standing up either because of his helmet. Other than that, the rest of the build is quite easy. The horse comes with his own ""helmet"" and a unicorn horn which attaches to it. Another odd flaw is that the cage, which opens and closes to enclose the captive, is slighty shorter than the rest of the cage. </p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Other than some small flaws here-and-there, the set is a great grab for only $6. It is a great army-builder and is also quite a bit of fun. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"SaintElsewhere","2010-09-26T19:40:32.963Z","There's definitely something missing.","When I compare this set to prison carriages in the past, I feel that TLG did not do as much as they could have. While the minifigures are stylish and the new parts are cool, the construction of the carriage is lacking. There is not much free space for the prisoner, and the Lion knight has absolutely no means of catching up to the carriage. (And the chances of him running after it in a fifty-pound suit of armour are very slim indeed) Despite these foibles, I find the set is overall somewhat enjoyable and makes for a good army builder. Recommended for diehard Castle/Kingdoms fans and/or small children, but the casual consumer would do best to walk past it.",FALSE,3,4,2,3,3
"Firox_5000","2010-08-25T19:55:21.947Z","nice set, bad price","<p>This is a very nice set. It contains two cool good knight figures, one with armour and one without. The set also includes a bad knight too. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The carriage is very small but&nbsp; is&nbsp; sized just right. The spike on the horse add's good detail to the set. I think the set is very good and fun and I would suggest adding it to another another bigger castle set for more exitement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only complaint is that £9.99 for three figures,50 pieces and a set smaller than the Star wars battle packs is a total rip off. it's 20p a piece and really should cost £5.99 and&nbsp;to not exceed £7.99.&nbsp; </p>

That right there is worth getting the set!<br>Also, getting three mini-figures is pretty awesome too. especially the knight with the reversible head. the prison wagon is cool too, although it is a little small and has no top. the back ladder piece is not quite as tall as the rest of the cage, which is a little strange, but its still really cool. the minifigures are quite detailed and the new helmet and fire and helmet feather are just some of the new cool pieces. <br>I like it because it's cheap, yet it comes with a horse, three minifigs, a wagon and cool accessories. for ten dollars, its definitely a good buy to add to any collection.<br>Overall, if you're into knights and castle sets and are looking to expand your army or just start collecting medieval sets, this is a set to buy!<br>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,5

"meyerc13","2010-11-01T18:12:19.713Z","Great except for the cart","My son just bought this set with his allowance, so I thought I'd do a quick review.&nbsp; Other than the Wizard, this is the only Kingdoms set he owns right now.&nbsp; In that light, this is a good starter set with three minifigs, two good and one bad.&nbsp; It also has a horse, and this is the first Lego horse we've owned (being more interested in LEGO City).&nbsp; There are enough weapons for all three with two swords and a spear.<br><br>The negative in this set is the cart.&nbsp; As others have mentioned it is just too small.&nbsp; You can squeeze the prisoner in there standing up, but it is a tight squeeze and he needs to bend forward slightly because his helmet pushes against the bars.&nbsp; Had LEGO made the cart 6 wide instead of 4 wide it would be perfect.<br><br>The set isn't a complete loss, it is easy enough to modify the cart to make it bigger if you have some spare pieces.&nbsp; Another option is to use the cart as something else... perhaps it is a medieval armored car transporting the money the tax collectors have gathered to bring it to the king.<br><br>In any case, the horse, minifigs, and harness/wheels from the cart are certainly useful enough, even though the rest of the cart needs some work.&nbsp; Pick up one or two of these sets to start your Kingdom and you can have fun playing until you add larger sets.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"DrathMaul1997","2010-12-27T17:03:40.317Z","Good Minifigures, but not much else...","<p>Right, this is a little test of the new review 'Eurobricks style' template, so I apologize if it goes horribly wrong...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>A nice size box that nicely accommodates the finished model, take the wheels off the cart and it goes straight on in. The instructions are nothing weird, there's no pictures of alternative models though sadly.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Not bad, a few dark green 1v1 slope bricks, a brown 'telescope' piece, prison bars, and some dark metallic head armour for the horse. There's not many rare pieces in here, but if you're thinking of making a MOC dragon knight castle it's a treasure trove.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>This is where the set really comes to life, all the minifigures have the back of their torso printed (!). The dragon soldier has a nicely detailed torso, A very nice face with orange hair and a greedy sort of expression, and comes with a dark metal helmet and sword, and a black spear. The Lion knight has nice printing on the torso and legs that makes him look quite heavily armored, he comes with a new helmet and a sword. The Lion soldier has a double sided face, one side with a comical scared expression, and the other with a crafty look on.&nbsp;</div><p><br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Nothing remarkable really, nor any nice techniques.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>The cart is not that good, the cage looks a bit multi colored, and the prisoner could jump out quite easily. This can be fixed with a few pieces from your collection however. The horse is good with the head armour and gold horn, and looks rather cross...&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Very good. As said the cage is rather bad, but can be fixed. The minifigures are some of the best I've seen, and herald a return to the old lion knights/black falcons scheme. It's good value and I recommend it if you can get it for £10 or under.</div><div><br></div><div>Hopefully this has helped you ^^</div>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,5
"AETerry","2011-08-30T10:21:51.333Z","Prison Carriage Rescue","I got this on clearance at a discounted price, but I am missing the black horse. So I can't complain too badly other then I'll have to try getting a hold of a black horse for this set.<br><br>Now, as far as the concept for this set as a Prison Carriage, I've seen LEGO do a couple other sets for Castle that are Prison Wagons, one with a Forestman as prisoner back in the late 80's, early 90's and there's another set that's even older. Both of those in my humble opinion are far better then this model.<br><br>And it has to do with the fact that the prisoner in this set, there is nothing stopping him from grabbing the spear on the side of the carriage and stabbing the Dragon Knight or simply hopping out himself. Added to that is there's barely any space or room for that prisoner minifigure to sit or stand. Plus, I would in a Prison Carriage design, have it completely secure, no open top. This set fails at that. With all of the Castle sets that LEGO has done over the years, they should have been able to do better.<br><br>The good points to this set are the assortment of Knights to add to a Castle collection and the new head piece gear/barding for the horse with the psuedo horn.<br><br>If I don't bother with looking to get a replacement horse for what was missing, this set will end up in my parts bin for MOCs.<br>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-15T13:09:56.687Z","Rescue the Lion Knight with the Lion Knight","<p>Set #7949 Prison Carriage Rescue: I still scratch my head as I look at the piece count for this set and the piece count for Knight's Showdown and have to wonder just why this one is the 12.99 set while the other one is the 9.99 set. I suppose it's because of the horse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prison Carriage is a small model, compact you might even say, it can seat the prisoner, but he has to sit with his arms straight down. Rather cruel that. Perhaps he should just stand up, but then you have to wonder why he doesn't just climb out through the open top to escape?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is pulled by a black horse with armor helmet and horn to transform an ordinary LEGO horse into a Black Unicorn. Pretty clever that, but I was kind of hoping that any Unicorns would actually have the horn attached permanently to their heads as part of the mold. But this way works too. Most older Castle sets of this type would include a saddle, or at least some of them did, but these days LEGO doesn't do that so you can't have the Dragon Knight ride off to escape on the unicorn while the Lion Knights dismantle his Prison Carriage, unfortuantely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are allright, the two Lion Knights are great, the Lion Knight coming to rescue his pal has a printed torso with armor design, and that fancy new helmet with the plume, as well as a sword and shield. He looks great. The other prisoner has a double-sided head, standard expressions, happy or scared at being captured. He doesn't include any weapons, but I suppose he could swipe that black spear when he's rescued and use it to defend himself. The Dragon Knight is the same torso and head we've seen in the other sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this is a good set to get as part of your Kingdoms collection, but it could stand a bit of an improvement to make it a bit more fair with the price to piece ratio, considering you get only 50 pieces compared to the cheaper Knight's Showdown's 90 pieces (or thereabouts.) for a lower cost, you have to wonder why LEGO didn't design the carriage to use a few more pieces and make it a bit wider/roomier for the prisoner. But then again prisoners rarely got comfortable treatment back in medieval times. So I suspect it fits. Still I don't think I'll be picking up another one of these like I sometimes do with smaller sets from LEGO Castle Themes.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"Sauron_Bauglir","2012-05-24T19:31:08.833Z","A Disappointing Set, Not up to the Standard of the Other Lego Kingdoms Sets","<p>This small set is not up to the standard of the other Lego Kingdoms sets. Lego Kingdoms is full of brilliant, tasteful buildings and figures. This is a boring and overpriced set. Here are the Pros and Cons:</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A few nice parts.</li><li>The Lion Knight is a good figure.</li><li>I like the horse.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The Lion Soldier hardly fits into the prison.</li><li>Boring build.</li><li>The Lion Soldier and Dragon Soldier aren't very good.</li><li>A knight in full armour could <b>never </b>keep up with a cart pulled by a horse.</li><li>Not worth NZ$20 at all. It is <b>way</b> overpriced.</li><li>If the knight does catch up, he will easily kill the Dragon Soldier. For what? The rescue of a single Lion Soldier, who is the lowest rank in the army? Unrealistic. A King would never send one of his knights <i>without a horse</i> to rescue a foot soldier, especially one that isn't very skilled.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is an overpriced, unrealistic set. It is not what I had come to expect from Lego Kingdoms. It is maybe good for small children, but unless, like me, you intend to collect every single Lego Kingdoms set (I missed out on the Kingdoms Joust&nbsp;unfortunately), then buy the other Kingdoms sets. Not this. Blacksmith Attack (6918) is a little bit cheaper, and way better. Even Knight's Showdown (7950) is cheaper, better <b>and has more peices.</b>&nbsp;Prison Carriage Rescue is a Disappointing&nbsp;set.</p>",TRUE,2,4,2,3,2

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks:</strong> the only building experience is the carriage which is easy to do, 3 is here really just above average.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks:</strong> I would have given 5 if LEGO would have added a saddle for the Dragon Knight. The cart can be used for other purposes too so is ok, a bit small maybe and not really a prisoner carriage by the way. 3 Nice minifigures with sufficient weapons and a bonus for the smile/cry face of the captured Lion Knight.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks:</strong> all is present to play your adventure with this set&nbsp;and like <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7950-1"">7950</a> very usefull with other Kingdom sets.</p>

"tvih","2012-06-19T09:42:21.817Z","Not quite up to the Kingdoms standard","<p>Unfortunately the ""title item"" of this set, the prison carriage, is also its downfall.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The minifigs are nice enough, and the prisoner gets a head with two face options and both sides get one shield to boot.</li><li>Horse with head cover.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The carriage is much too small. You can only fit the prisoner inside it sideways. Trying to put him there ""chest forward/backward"" isn't possible because the figure is simply too wide for that. Something at least the size of the wagon in the Mill Village Raid is needed here.</li><li>Logically the carriage isn't exactly a good design for holding a prisoner, since the prisoner could easily just climb out. Thus a higher design with roof would be nice.</li><li>The set isn't a great value for money. It wouldn't be so bad if the carriage wasn't next to useless as is.</li></ul>
<p>As can be seen the carriage is pretty underwhelming indeed. I bought several of this set from a clearance for army-building purposes. So it leaves me thinking I should probably combine the carriage parts from two sets to make fewer but larger wagons. Might need a few non-set parts to go with that, as well, but it's a start, and my suggestion in general is to modify the carriage by whatever means for best results. Now I just need to find some saddles for the extra horses this leaves me with!</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3
"J14T14","2019-11-06T18:47:22.037Z","Great Kingdoms Starter Pack!","<p>So far, this is the only kingdoms set that I own. I got it as a birthday gift&nbsp;when it was still on shelves, and it is still one of my favorite sets. While it isn&#39;t anything special when compared to today&#39;s standards, but it was pretty nice for the time.</p>

<p>First off, the build. We gat an old-style back horse in this set that can work great outside of this setting. The one thing that makes this awesome though is the armor for the head that was around for this theme. It covers the entire head except for the ears and eyes, and it makes the horse look angry and menacing. I also love the inclusion of the horn on the front which makes the horse also seem pretty dangerous. The cart that it is pulling has a place for the driver to sit at the front and a place for the captured knight to sit in the back. There are also two clips on the side to hold a spear and a torch.</p>

<p>The Minifigures&nbsp;in this set are awesome! The dragon knight looks mean and threatening, though he does look like he could be defeated by the literal knight in shining armor from the lions side of the theme. This knight has a shiny silver helmet with a red plume and shiny printing on the torso and legs. The final&nbsp;Minifigure&nbsp;is the captured knight. He has no logo on him, but his color scheme makes it clear that he is on the lion&#39;s side of the theme. He has a double-sided face. One scared expression for when he is captured, and one smug look for when he is freed.</p>

<p>Overall, this is an amazing set! Three Minifigures and a horse! This set is a great starter pack for the theme and could also make for a good army builder. This was definitely a nice small set that should not have been passed up when it was being sold.</p>
