"terfsten","2012-01-13T09:43:05.807Z","Get Ready to Rumble!","This is an awesome set. It comes with an Xtreme Daredevils racers team 
desert buggy with Rex-treme and Max-treme minifigures, a Backyard 
Blasters team desert racing truck with Bubba Blaster and Billy Bob 
Blaster minifigs, and a huge Xtreme Daredevils repair semi truck with 
three mechanics. It also contains a winners platform with trophy and one
 racing official minifig.<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>It has a big box and three instruction booklets.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4>It has a ton of pieces! You build a repair semi, a winners platform, a desert racing buggy, and a desert racing truck. It has many pieces in order to build these in great detail.<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>This set has 8 minifigures. It has Rex-treme, Max-treme, Bubba Blaster, Billy Bob Blaster, 3 mechanics, and 1 racing official minifigures. They have many accessories including 6 mechanic's tools, a racing trophy, a racing flag, fire extinguishers, 4 racing helmets (2 black, 2 gray), and&nbsp; baseball caps ( 1 orange, 3 lime green)<br>
<h4>The build</h4>This set has a great build. Having so many parts there is a lot of building.The desert racing truck has big tires, ""wing"" doors, transparent green headlights,a seat for the driver and one for the guy controlling the cannon, and a well built, aiming sand cannon. The desert buggy has 4 flick missiles, 2 seats, a lifting cockpit and engine hood, and a removable engine. The mechanic's semi has a large cabin, a trailer hookup, a crane for changing the engine of the buggy to another more ""souped up"" engine. a holder for 6 tools (a wrench, a screwdriver, a hammer, an oil can, a socket wrench, and a drill), 2 fire extinguishers, 2 replacement tires, a power washer, a cannon, and folding doors for the buggy to sit on and get repaired. The winner's podium has desert shrubbery and three platforms labeled 1,2, and 3 with a trophy.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4>The completed model is very good. the only problem is that the trailer's hookup to the semi's cab sometimes falls out. The cab of the semi looks powerful like it could haul a really heavy load. The trailer contains many accessories and has a cannon for defense from the blasters. The buggy has flick fire missiles and looks like it could go really fast. The truck has a top mounted cannon and is mainly built for busting through dunes and attacking the other trucks. Whoever wins gets the trophy.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall You should definitely get this set. Especially if it's on sale.This is a really great set.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,3
"Mickitat","2012-04-02T04:44:08.797Z","Not really a great set","<p>At first I thought this was a very nice set, but after actually building it, I found more and more things that I disliked - aside from the excessive use of stickers.<br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>- truck looks menacingly enough<br></li><li>- nice color scheme on the whole theme<br></li><li>- spare engine can actually be exchanged</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>- no steering on any of the vehicles (the red one has non-fixed axles, but the are both not fixed, which makes the vehicle even less steerable)<br></li><li>- excessive use of stickers<br></li><li>- truck has no doors (and no ladders to even reach up there)<br></li><li>- only one minifig can be seated in the truck<br></li><li>- truck exhausts fall of easily</li><li>- truck rear axles are visible from above (there should be something to hide that there is actually no drive system)<br></li><li>- trailer has to be lifted up to connect to truck (it cannot be driven under)</li><li>- trailer tires do not fit those of the truck and look bad</li><li>- spare tires are not the same ones used on the small green vehicle (with only two additional parts, the had been interchangeable, too)<br></li><li>- sides of the trailer look strange (too many gaps)</li><li>- I dislike both types of guns since they really do not look like Lego at all</li><li>- red vehicle flops over easily if you push it (rear axle is not fixed)</li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>The kids liked the set, though, but playability is limited, far more so than I thought. This is actually an astonishingly flawed set. Apparently it did not really sell well, either, I bought a couple for less than 40 Euros just for the parts.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,2
"fifek","2012-06-03T09:53:01.437Z","One of the best sets we've constructed with my 5 year old son.","<p>This set is one of the best we have. We have constructed it with my 5 yo son 3 days, each day one car. The cars are very good, compact and solid. Each holds 2 minifigs. The truck is very big. The set has a lot of original (unique) parts. Design of the set is very thought-out. Good idea of the garage on the truck, where there are spare tires, crane for changing engine, computer, tools and nitro tank with hose. In addition two great guns appears in this set. The first one on the red car with 3 balls and very original idea of their launch (they fly quite far). The second one on the truck with one missile with safe rubber ending - it also flies very far.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: A lot of parts and stickers.<br></li><li>Pro 2: 8 minifigs.<br></li><li>Pro 3: Very good design.</li><li>Pro 4: Interchangeable engine.</li><li>Pro 5: A lot of movable parts (crane, nitro station, exhaust pipes of the truck, 2 cannons, side walls of the truck, tailgates of the cars, red car's suspension, rubber closings of the truck side walls, red car's ""wings"" and windscreen).&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 6: 2 great long range cannons.&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 7: 2 floors truck trailer.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Podium and cup are not necessary.<br></li><li>Con 2: The red car has a bit ""soft"" construction.<br></li><li>Con 3: The green car's engine could be encased in some way.<br></li></ul>
<p>Very good set with a lot of fun for parent and for kid. My 5 yo son adore it, since he wanted some kind of garage. The set gave him original garage, many hours of building and fun and very big truck.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
