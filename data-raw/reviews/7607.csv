I am annoyed that there are no&nbsp; more&nbsp; Lego World Racers getting released as far as our concern goes. On the other hand this is an amazing set. I really like the green snow treader, I think it is an interesting way of making it. I personally like stickers when it comes to Lego so 5 stars for that. I think that the helicopter had a&nbsp; problem although. When you attach the winch for the boulders, a lot of times it will get caught. It doesn't affecting my rating for the sets because I am a collector not some one who plays with sets. The red vehicle left me speachless, it has got to be one of the best Lego vehicles to be made. The claw is perfect and the blade in front is nice and spins smoothly. Overall this set deserves 5 stars. My only real complaint is that the pieces are drifting away from the old traditional Lego bricks.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
