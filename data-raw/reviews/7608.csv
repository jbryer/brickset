"Firox_5000","2010-07-10T13:50:11.043Z","My first train set","I recently bought this from Argos for £129.99 . <br/>&nbsp;<br/>The first look o f the set is the box is very big and heavy and has nine bags one which has flexible train track in .&nbsp; The building for the eight sub divided models is fairly easy&nbsp; but does take quite a long duration probably 2 1/2 hours . <br/>&nbsp;<br/>But when finished the set looks great . Quite a good size for it's price You get the cargo train ,an oil tanker , a cargo carriage has a container on and another container carriage which has two cars on like the 2010 small car but different colours and slightly different in design too .&nbsp; <br/>&nbsp;<br/>it also includes a truck which can carry the cargo and containers and a crane which is slightly similar to the 2007 harbour crane .<br/>&nbsp;<br/>After tamperign around with the remote and battery box which requires 9 triple a batteris the set is very fun to play with . <br/>&nbsp;<br/>To operate the train press the button on the battery box and if it works a green light will appear . and then with the remote turn the left turntable and the train should start moving [as long as it is on the track!] . The train itself is very fun to play with and you can make it go super fast or painfully slow . It can also take all four cargo carriages but may fall off the track if it is going to fast . <br/>&nbsp;<br/>But overall the set is very fun . Kids and adults will both enjoy playing with this freight set . With the fun of changing the tracks ,speed and carriages . <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Despite it's giant price at £130 it is well worth the money and is great fun . I recommend this set to everyone.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"jjr","2010-10-25T10:04:11.463Z","Best train set in the last decade!","<p>This is my review on the Cargo train</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The box</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">We begin with the front of the box. Ofcourse the general information about the set like with many Lego boxes. However the box is smaller than the previous Cargo train (7898),</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">What's in the box. Ofcourse the bigger parts are thrown in the box. One of my switches was bended so it doesn't stay flat on the ground, but there is more negative news. </p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><br/><strong>The instructions</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">The instruction books were heavily bended, especially the one from the crane and the locomotive. </p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">The rest of the books were okay.</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong>The PF Parts</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">The small box insede consist of the PF devices. The new motor wich looks almost like the last one only with orange instead of white. Also the new one has a fixed wire on it.&nbsp; </p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">The remote control, looks on the box so much bigger than in real life, almost a (I hate to say this) a cute little remote.&nbsp; The batterybox. I haven't used it because I use the rechargable one for the train. I think it's really cool that Lego made the two of similar size so that it's easy to buildt it in the train without mayor modifications. </p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong>Bag 1 Locomotive</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">The new front part does fit PF lights. It's not noted in the instructions or any other material I've seen from Lego. I would say this is a missed chance for Lego, but the lights are easy to build in. Like Lego intended to make the lights but later cancelled it. Also included are two minifigs, a driver and a yard worker. The locomotive has one dummy motor which looks like the real motor.</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong>Bag 2 fininshed Locomotive</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">Bag 2 for the rest of the locomotive. The IR reciever and batterybox are both in a&nbsp;seperate bag. Once finished the locomotive the driver is easy to acces because the front of the train can open. At least it's not a prefab piece like the last passengertrain. It contains many stickers but I don't mind. If I remember correclty 12 Volt trains also had many stickers. The building was easy because every every step adds only a few bricks. Which is the reason why the instructions contains so many pages. Also a new expirience for me was building with PF parts. </p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong>Bag 3 Octan tank car</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">when the wagon is finished you get a nice tank car from the Lego oil campany called Octan.&nbsp;Building was not that hard. I think the scale is the best one we've had so far for Lego trains. I wish we could get this one seperate....</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong>Bag 4 Car transport</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">When I was building I saw some kind of new mold for an old piece. A hole has been made for a technic pin. This set contains four of them (it's somekind of old mudgard piece). Once finished you get two smart cars like the one in set 3177 only with some color differences. Once the wagon is&nbsp;finished you get a flatcar with to carss&nbsp;Building was not hard at all because it's just a flatbed with two cars on top of it. Still it's a good looking wagon. </p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong>Bag 5 container car</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">During the buildt I noted that this type of car is different from anything we've seen so far from Lego train cars. You get a nice flatbed with a large red container. </p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong>Bag 6 The truck</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">A nice red truck, with a small yellow container. It's decent and it looks like a real truck. Only with one container it looks rather odd but with the big one it looks good. A little bit stupid that we didn't get two small containers and one big one. </p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong>bag 7 Crane</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">The content of this bag is not very different from what we've seen in this set. Many parts are also used in the previous sub models to keep the cost low for Lego.&nbsp; Once finished you get an easy to handle crane and also looks really good. The last ones for the trains didn't look as good as this one. But that's just my opinion. </p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong>The rest</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">You also get a small loop of rails with the new flex-track. Despite I don't liked them I really find them useful for my layout. </p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">I tested the train and it can pull much more than the last cargo train. Maybe even more than 9 volt trains but I don't know that because I don't own one. </p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><br/></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">I think it a really good set. A little pricey but it's still a great starter set which can be expanded with more track, signals, stations and much more. I think the new trains are the best ones released in years. The PF parts are welcome too because you can add more stuff to your train (rechargable batterybox and lights). I believe that if Lego continous this type of trains (PF) it'even possible that we get an era that's better than the 12 volt one. (just kidding...or am I?:P)</p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm""><br/></p>
<P style=""MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"">You will love it if you like City or trains, or both ofcourse:P.</p>

"Krogh","2010-10-14T18:49:36.73Z","My first train set! NOW i get what all the fuzz is about.","Alright, so i realized, that i was at 99 sets, so my 100 set just HAD to be something special, i have been looking at these train sets for quite some time now, but there were 2 problems, the first would be integrating a train track into an existing road only city, the next would be the insane prices on these train sets. Well, since my city is packed away right now, the first concern would be a small problem, but the price. Man, the price. This set is 1499 Dkr (Danish Kroner) on lego.com, overall the same price in retail stores. To put this in perspective, this amount calculated directly to US dollars is, at the time of this review,&nbsp;283.46 USD, and that is just insane, and for those wondering, the same goes for any other lego set here in Denmark.&nbsp;Anyway, i managed to find a private seller, who had won the set in a contest, so i got it at 40% off the retail price, and that was brand new, sealed in box. Bottom line, LEGO, fix your prices! No one here in Denmark has the money to spend with these prices.<div><br></div><div>So, enough ranting, on with the review. My 100 set, as you might have guessed, ended up being this wonderfull set. Since it has so many parts, i'll split the review up, and take a look at the individual parts. Let's start with the crane.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Crane:<br></b>This is a good addition, it is meant to lift the containers of the train, onto the truck, and the other way around to, ofcourse. It is a rail mounted crane, and it slides on the rail. It has a functioning winch, operated by a handle on the back on both sides.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Truck:<br></b>This is the only bad thing in the set. It is a fairly standard tractor cab, and other than the weird looking front, nothing is wrong here. Well, one more thing, where did the mirrors go? The trailer on the other hand, is bad. I love the idea of a trailer, capable of transporting containers, but the execution, is flawed. When the trailer is hooked up to the truck it actually tilts backwords. In other words, it's taller in the front, than in the back, this makes it look very weird. Fortunatly, it can be fixed.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Small cars:<br><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">So, some of you might have seen my review of the '3177 Small Car' set, these 2 are variations of this very set, so, if you wan't a detailed review, i recommend checking that out. :) The cars sit on a train car, a nice simple car, but it has one big flaw. The train set is battery powered, and it can in fact go fairly fast around the track, and when doing this, the cars can come flying of the tracks, this is because of the way they sit on the train car, not a good design.</span></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br></span></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Container train car:</b></span></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">Here we have the counterpart to the container truck, a very simple train car, but it is brilliant in it's design. It can carry one large container (like the red one in the set), or 2 smaler ones (like the yellow one), it's a great addition to the set, and i am very happy with it.<br><br><b>Tanker train car:<br></b>I have always been very fond of the Octan color scheme, and this is no exception, i like this very much, i can't really say much about it, it's good looking, it's a brilliant design, it's a nice color scheme, it's just nice.<br><br><b>Cargo train:<br></b>Time for the star of the show! Here's where the set earns it's points, besides looking good, it also runs on batteries, six of them, in a huge batterybox, hidden inside the train. AAA batteries for those that wondered. The power featues are as follows: A battery box, a reciever, the engine itself, wich is built into the back wheel assembly, and the remote. All this electric stuff, makes the train really heavy, and thats a good thing, it helps keep it on the tracks when going fast, and it feels great when you handle it. The train has 7 speeds, the lowest of wich, results in the train barely creeping along, and the fastest has the train derailing at every turn. Really good fun! Just be carefull you don't run the train of the edge of a table, it shatters into a thousand pieces, as lego tends to do when dropped, hehe. All in all, a good train, with lot's and lot's of playability, untill the batteries die at least. ;)<br><br><b>Remote, tracks and minifigs:<br></b><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">The remote is powered by 3 AAA batteries, so that's 9 total. 9! Insane. it has 4 channels, even though the box says 8. they achieve this number by having 2 remotes in 1, so in fact, you have 2x4 channels. It works great, but i would have liked a smooth speed control instead of the 7 step one. The remote has an emergancy stop button, wich, incredebly enough, stop the train, theres a switch to change direction, and the wheel that controls the speed. It works fairly well, but the range is short.</span></b></span></b></span></b></div><div>The tracks are your standard generic grey tracks, there is enough to make a complete basic track, and there are also some flexible tracks, wich can come in very handy in a tight spot.<br>The set comes with 4 minifigs, a driver for the train, a driver for the truck, a driver for the crane, and a worker to help the crane driver. All great minifigs.<br><br><br>Well, that should be all, iv'e always wondered why people are so fascinated by the train sets, and now i know, it is just incredible fun controlling the train. I will definetly pick up more of these sets, when and if i find the for a deascent price. :)</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks to all those who had the endurance to read the entire review! If you like it, feel free to check out my other reviews.</div><div><br>The set get's a generous 4/5. :)<br><br><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3

This will only produce 6 or 4,8V. The use a DC/DC steep up to increase the voltage to exactly 9V at all times with all kind of battery's. Because there already electronics in the box, the additional price of this will be mere around €1 to produce but the additional value to the costumer well be huge.",TRUE,4,4,5,5,3

"av8r1973","2011-08-16T13:32:53.3Z","Lots of playability!","<p>This is my 3rd (of 4) LEGO train sets to assemble and it was the 2nd most fun.&nbsp; The train seems like a downgrade from the 7898 Cargo Train Deluxe, but is still chock full of neat little features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First the pros:</p>
<p>1. Multiple cars - engine, flatbed, tanker, auto transporter</p>
<p>2. Multiple vehicles - tractor trailer, 2 cars for the transporter</p>
<p>3. Remote control - standard for today's trains, but still cool</p>
<p>4. Multiple loading options - 40' container, 20' container, 1 car or 2 cars...</p>
<p>5. Well-engineered and sturdy loading crane that withstands the abuse of a 4-year old. Clever build technique that I will carry on to older kits that have weak points.</p>
<p>6. Storage compartments on the train - haven't filled them yet, but the coffee cup comes to mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the cons:</p>
<p>1. Cost - at $169, it's a stretch.&nbsp; This should have been a $149 train, at best, or include another car or more track elements</p>
<p>2. Default track layout - includes straights, curves, switches and flexi-track, but the siding seems like an afterthought to get rid of surplus flex elements at the factory.&nbsp; A more realistic siding would have been nice, or inclusion of a crossing (can't get enough of them).</p>
<p>3. No horn!&nbsp; 7898 included a horn, which is a must for kids!&nbsp; Is it really that hard to add back to the remote?</p>
<p>4. Lack of detail when compared to 7898.&nbsp; Maybe it's just a nit, but it seems that LEGO slid backwards on this one.&nbsp; With a freighter out now,&nbsp;this may not have been a necessary train to release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, I&nbsp;am glad I bought it.&nbsp; It adds a lot of color and more cars to my train/City layout.&nbsp; I still have the Maersk to build and the freighter is on order.&nbsp; Let you know how those work out.&nbsp; If you are on the fence on this one, try to find it used.&nbsp; Or find a 7898, you'll be happier.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4

<p>This set was purchased second hand and did not come with a box although <a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/7939_Cargo_Train"">looking at images of the box</a> it is clear that parts were separated into eight numbered bags.</p>

<p>There was a sticker sheet but as this was purchased second hand, the stickers had already been applied. I normally don&#39;t apply stickers.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>2010 saw the introduction of Power Functions in City Trains.&nbsp;This set along with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7938-1/Passenger-Train"">7938 Passenger Train</a>&nbsp;were the first City Trains to use the seven speed&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8879-1/IR-Speed-Remote-Control"">IR Speed Remote control</a>&nbsp;as well as the new <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/88002-1/Train-Motor"">Train Motors</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/88000-1/AAA-Battery-Box"">AAA Battery Box</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to this, City Trains were powered by <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Trains/subtheme-9-V"">9V tracks</a>&nbsp;with the exception of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7898-1/Cargo-Train-Deluxe"">7898 Cargo Train Deluxe</a>&nbsp;(in 2006)&nbsp;which used an earlier version of remote control and train motor.</p>

<p>The box has an image&nbsp;showing&nbsp;how the new remote control works.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The set comes with four minifigures; a train driver, gantry crane operator, truck driver and a marshalling assistant.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5830/22074247712_924e10bb8f_o.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 380px;"" /></p>

<p>All these figures have been seen in lots of sets so there is nothing new here.</p>

<p>The train driver has a hot drink in a red cup and the marshalling assistant uses a radio to talk to the team.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>As the build is divided into several discrete&nbsp;stages, it is easy to work at your own pace and build this set in modules.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The yellow engine is a sturdy design and resembles an electric engine such as <a href=""http://westmidlandsrailways.weebly.com/class-92s.html"">British Rail type 92 engine</a>. The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4580430"">front and rear yellow windows</a> hinge up to allow access to the drivers compartment. This is the only set with this piece in yellow.</p>

<p>There is a great selection of rolling stock with an Octan&nbsp;oil&nbsp;tanker rail car, a forty foot container on a flat car and two small vehicles on another forty foot flat car.</p>

<p>All this cargo can be moved about using a gantry crane. The crane driver&#39;s seat rests on a turntable so he can swivel around depending on where the cargo is. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The cargo can be transferred onto the truck and delivered to the customer.</p>

<p>The set comes with <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4279717"">16 curved tracks</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4279714"">eight straight tracks</a>, a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4516092"">left</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6085188"">right</a> set of points and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4535745"">16 flexi-track</a>&nbsp;pieces.</p>

<p>This amount of track enables you to make some really interesting track layouts.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is a regular LEGO train that is still available&nbsp;at reasonable prices. The engine is great and there is a great selection of rolling stock.</p>

<p>Added to that is the cargo handling facility of the gantry crane and a truck with a LEGO branded container along with a good selection of track pieces.</p>

<p>All of these features&nbsp;makes this a truly self-contained LEGO train set.</p>

<p>See if you can source this train in the local market.</p>

"chinnant","2016-05-10T16:07:06.483Z","A great train set with great value","<p>Being the first &#39;City&#39; sub-theme train set that used the Power Functions system, I think that LEGO started out on the right foot. This train set did a good job replicating it&#39;s great counterpart, the Deluxe Cargo Train from 2006, by including many valuable play features and a decent sized track layout.</p>

<p>Locomotive:</p>

<p>More recent train fans will recognize this engine to look nearly identical to the locomotive from the Heavy Haul train, as it uses the same front pieces. Overall, I like the Heavy Haul engine more, but I think this one is good too. I like the addition of hand rails by the cab doors, and the yellow/black/grey scheme is nice.</p>

<p>Tank Car:<br />
<br />
My favorite car included in this set is the tank car. It has a decently robust design, even though it uses SNOT methods to hold the tanks. I am one of the many TFOL and AFOLS that went back on Bricklink to buy multiples of this car.</p>

<p>Flat Car:</p>

<p>Ugh. Another flat car. Looking back on the later train sets after this one, I feel that this started the trend of lots of flat cars in sets. The Heavy Haul train has 2, and so does the Summer 2014 Cargo Train. Nothing special here, although I like the inclusion of a blue version as&nbsp;well as the original white &#39;Small Car&#39; set.</p>

<p>Container car:</p>

<p>I like this car very much, especially since it looks great with the Maersk train. The inclusion of an alternate container is good.</p>

<p>Overall Thoughts:</p>

<p>While this set has it&#39;s flaws, I think that it has good value for money. I think it has good play value, and for the 130 US dollars, it was great.</p>
