<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set comes with three figures , one male , one female as well as a male driver. You get a train with three carriages and a station . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first carriage does not have any seating in it. This is because the battery box and motor are inside here . The windows here are replaced by black. However the driver can still sit in the driving seat which is there . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The middle carriage has three tables with chairs facing each other and you can place up to six figures sitting down . The last carriage can hold up to 4 people sitting and also has a drivers seat at the back too . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The train set also includes a station . it has seats for up to two figures to sit on , a bin and a board which has a sticker put on saying times and locations of major sets in and near europe e.g london and madrid I think.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as those the&nbsp; set&nbsp; includes&nbsp; 12 pieces of curved&nbsp; track , 16 pieces of flexible track and a signal box too . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is very good fun&nbsp; and can keep you entertained for a fair&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only complaints about this set&nbsp; are that £100.00 ish for this set&nbsp; seems quite steep really for what you&nbsp; get&nbsp; and&nbsp; eventhough it is motorized you dont get as&nbsp; much track as you would like really . I think the set should be £89.99 and also come with 4-8&nbsp; pieces of straight track as well or instead of the flexible ones.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The station doesn't seem too great either , too similar to the one of 2006. They should have made a slightly bigger station with more information and even a ticket office. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But apart from that it is a good set and I highly suggest you buy this . For more fun&nbsp; I would recomend getting the Cargo train too&nbsp; if&nbsp; you&nbsp; have&nbsp; the&nbsp; money and&nbsp; space&nbsp; availible.

I got the bug about a year ago to start collecting lego again and I am really glad I did. I treated myself to set 7938. From opening the box I could tell things had changed the detail is amazing the colours are striking and the enjoyment of the build was perfect. The train looks the part and is a perfect scale. The RC is perfect. Speed is very easy to control and it even sounds like a train on the tracks. The only thing I don't like is that it don't have a horn but you can't have everything. I just got the level crossing and will be getting the station. Lego like myself has grown up but think it is wearing better than me. I will get the cargo set next and want to build up a large train network that I can then add all the really cool city sets too.

"SgtSmash","2011-04-25T11:33:37.72Z","A great set but not enough track","<p>I have never owned a Lego train set before, and I was a bit apprehensive buying this #7938 Passenger Train simply because I knew it would not include enough track to get&nbsp; around my entire city.&nbsp;That personal tidbit&nbsp;aside,&nbsp;the train itself is very nice,&nbsp;was a lot of fun to build, and even more fun to watch zip around the track. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Passenger Train really is a ""must have"" if you want to add a sense of realism to your Lego City. The color scheme and transport logo on the train go along with other sets offered such as the Public Transport set, Airport, and especially the #7937 Train Station which I&nbsp;already own. You get 3 minifigs (1 conductor and 2 passengers) along with a small train stop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then there is&nbsp;the track. Anybody&nbsp;who buys any Lego train set at full retail must deal with the reality that you're going to have to buy extra track too, if you want it to cover your town.&nbsp;However, the jury is out on this new ""flexible track"" which comes&nbsp;included and is now offered in lieu of the old straight track. The flexi-track&nbsp;does not&nbsp;make&nbsp;very good straight track (which I would need a TON of), and is not very pretty to look at, and honestly&nbsp;doesn't serve a whole lot of purpose because you can't make any real twists and bends that set it apart from the curved track which is still available. And unlike the old style of track, you&nbsp;cannot clamp&nbsp;down flexi-track onto any surface plate (why not, Lego?) to keep it stable, which seems a bit mind boggling considering the entire premise of Lego is to connect bricks to one another...but&nbsp;perhaps this is not considered ""brick"". I wouldn't consider it track either...but I digress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, if you want to&nbsp;pay a kings' ransom you can&nbsp;buy lengths of old&nbsp;straight track on Ebay,&nbsp;but&nbsp;at this time, funds are lacking so the #7938 Passenger Train will just be making a small loop around a few of my Modular buildings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would say this to Lego,&nbsp;please begin offering&nbsp;the ""old style"" straight track again, perhaps by&nbsp;itself without the flexi and curved track, and&nbsp;a bit more cost effective, considering the costs of the train sets.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,2,5,5,3
"beegeedee","2011-10-19T12:27:23.78Z","Good but could be better","<p>I have always liked train sets, ever since I got a Hornby set when I was a kid. I always wanted an Intercity 125 but never did get one and never really had room to play with the train set. I always have loved lego and as a kid I had a desk with sliding tops and different compartments for the various lego pieces that my father made for me. So lego trains to me are brilliant. I even had one of the old lego trains years ago with the blue tracks but never had the batteries to use it.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, the passenger and cargo trains are expensive, even with the IR control, battery box and train engine. However, they are cool and the ability to use them wirelessly is amazing considering old train sets had power running through the tracks.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Building the train set is fairly easy. An hour or 2 to put it together being familiar with the power functions is probably all it will take. The track is similarly easy to assemble<br></p><p><br></p><p>So, the pros and cons...<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>It's a train<br></li><li>It's a wireless train</li><li>The track doesn't have the power - it's on the train itself.</li><li>You can have up to 8 of them with one controller though I have to say I'd probably use 1 controller per 2 trains, not that I'll have more than 2 any time soon<br></li><li>It's a really nice size. Don't be deceived by pictures, the train and carriages are over 24"" long - I figured they'd be smaller. FYI the cargo train is a little longer too.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The shortness of the track supplied</li><li>The boxiness of the train and even though it is curved, I find the cargo train more attractive in many ways</li><li>The real lack of accessories with the set. 3 mini figures are fine
 but all it has is a tiny station platform that, to be fair is fairly 
lame</li><li>The full price of this set. In Ireland this set normally retails for around 120 Euro which is about 30-40 euro more than it should be in my opinion</li><li>The controller - I have 3 now. Yes, they are needed but it would also be more sensible to sell a set without it and sell it bundled as a separate item. that way, if you have cargo train you dont need the controller.</li><li>Lights would have been nice<br></li></ul>

<p>It's a nice set to be sure but if the set was combined with 7936 Level Crossing or even better 7937 Train station as the actual set at the same price it would be worth buying.</p><p>Even though the 7939 Cargo Train is more expensive it is better value for money as it has more playability (cars, a truck, the crane) than a boring circular track. I suspect the Red Cargo Train is also similarly overpriced like this set. However, if you can get it at a bargain price don't hesitate - it's a nice addition to your city collection.<br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3

"av8r1973","2011-01-04T00:50:30.537Z","Killer addition to my city - glad I got it!","<p>I got the set for my 5yo daughter, but I end up playing with it more than she does.&nbsp; The remote control is great! It even has an emergency stop button in case of derailment or attemtped minicide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really, it's a nice set that resembles any metro light-rail link system.&nbsp; It's sleek and smooth.&nbsp; I love the new track segments.&nbsp; They are easy to incorporate into your city.&nbsp; I am just going to have to invest heavily in Duracell.&nbsp; I like not having power packs or wires going to the tracks since everything is internal to the train.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was mediocre.&nbsp; The trains were pretty repetitive, but not too bad.&nbsp; There's only so much you can do to make identical cars.&nbsp; The motor enclosures are pretty cleverly integrated - I love that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The various speeds are handled well, since the center of gravity is pretty low.&nbsp; You can easily derail it on the higher speeds, but you don't need to go so fast to have fun.&nbsp; The mini platform is just so-so, but they make a nice train crossing and station (we got them both).&nbsp; These add some additional detail to the set, as well as a lot more additional track to expand the length of the route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The motor is powerful enough to push/pull 9 cars, so more cars would be very welcome. It will even handle gentle grades (2 lugs per track length), so the variety possible within a city layout (or your living room) is wonderful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with the modular buildings, this one will cost me more money.&nbsp; I now need to get the cargo train and the Emerald Night to make a nice rail system.&nbsp; It really adds another dimension to your city, so it's absolutely worth it.&nbsp; I hope LEGO continues to support this format with additional cars and utility.&nbsp; For the price, it's a great deal, too.&nbsp; The cargo train is another US$50 and does the same thing (with a different utilitarian purpose and look).</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2012-02-16T17:10:53.87Z","The Reviewing of LEGO 7938.","<div>In taking a glance at the reviews, it seems that while most folks have no problem with the train itself, people have raised complaints about the lack of straight tracks and the Spartan train platform that comes with the relatively pricey Passenger Train. What I am about to say will become immediately obvious to anyone who picks up this set: these apparent deficiencies are no more than highly-effective marketing ploys, and I, for one, was fully and consciously sucked into them.</div><div><br></div><div>You see, Passenger Train is the first LEGO train set that I have ever owned, and I am not at all disappointed to have invested in it (although I was gouged quite severely for shipping and taxes from ordering off of LEGO.com, an unavoidable course of action since everywhere else was selling this set for much more on top of the shipping/taxes). And once everything is fully built up, you’ll find that there is no doubt a great sense of pleasure in controlling the train remotely as it speeds around the track, and you will, mark my words, find yourself wanting more, and you will willingly part with your hard-earned cash in favour of fleshing out your new model train adventure.</div><div><br></div><div>Let there be no mistake: the train itself is gorgeous. It is a LEGO train, after all, and so its inherent blockiness gives it more commonality with antiquated American Amtrak trains as opposed to their sleeker and flashier European or Japanese cousins, but they have enough by way of sexy curved pieces to make them look good.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The “engine” has several components to it, the main points of interest being the wireless receiver and the battery box. Incidentally, this set requires a grand total of nine AAA batteries (!!) to operate, of which zero are included in the box, obviously, so hopefully you have a lot of those guys lying around the house or you’ll have to be prepared to run out to the store to get some in the midst of the excitement of your brand new train pulling into town. The “engine” requires six batteries to operate, and although the build is slightly fiddly, what results is a rather clever design in which the battery box can be easily removed, which is definitely a big plus. There’s also a green on/off indicator that’s visible from the driver’s seat so that you know that you’re not running your batteries down.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The two other cars are easy builds that have a tantalising number of seats to accommodate many more Minifigs than the two non-conductor Minifigs that come with the set, which brings us to the first calculated deficiency of this set: lack of Minifigs. I understand that the remote control and the electrical bits partially account for the price of the set, but would another Minifig or two have been unreasonable? &nbsp;Still, the conductor Minifig is cool and the female Minifig does come with one of those neat sling bags, so that’s something nice to have.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The train platform has attracted much ire, but it’s honestly not horrible, all things considered. In spite of its simple build, I think it does a good job of conveying the feel of a rural or small suburban-type stop, and it is configured in a way that is very similar to the much grander Train Station (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7937-1"">7937</a>). The issue is not that the platform is bad, but that it’s inadequate compared to the size of the train. Then again, what did you expect, right? A fully-fledged train station would have set the price of this set up by another $50 at least.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, we come to the issue of the infamous “flexi-tracks”. Yes, they are ugly. Yes, this set should most definitely have come with some straight tracks. But unfortunately, it does not, hence the reason for the existence of the equally infamous Flexible and Straight Tracks (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7499-1"">7499</a>). One way around the issue of unnecessary bendiness is to get a couple of thin 1 x 8 or 1 x 10 pieces (or whatever you happen to have lying around) and “brace” the side of the flexi-tracks with them to prevent them from bending. It’s a slightly inelegant solution, but it is a solution all the same. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Based on my own experiences, I’ve found that while Passenger Train is a fantastic train overall, this set serves as a starter and nothing more. A week later, I threw down some more cash for 7937 and 7499, and the whole display looks amazing. So, let the buyer beware: Passenger Train may just suck you in to the world of LEGO trains, which may not be a bad thing at all, save for as far as your wallet is concerned. Just imagine: a LEGO version of Before Sunrise right at your fingertips! (Or LEGO Unstoppable, if you so prefer.)</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,2
"PeteM","2017-05-04T11:59:27.107Z","Everything Old Is New Again","<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">As I was getting back into Lego after some time away (15 years) it was train sets that caught my eye as they had been my main focus of my childhood collection. Though the more adult-friendly <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10194-1/Emerald-Night"">10194 Emerald Night</a> was my first purchase, I was curious see what had changed (or stayed the same) with the more traditional Town/City offerings&hellip;</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Box / Instructions</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The large box shows off the set as well as prominently displaying the power functions elements included, while the back features a variety of dioramas showing the train in various settings.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">There are four instruction manuals included, splitting the build into easy to manage chunks. There is no practical requirement for this many instruction manuals, but if building as a family or group, responsibilities can be divided out to multiple parties for building simultaneously! The back of each booklet runs from the sublime &ndash; a scene consisting of the range of train sets then available in a busy yard / station setting &ndash; to the alarming: yes, the terrifyingly intense &lsquo;WIN!&rsquo; kid is present and correct&hellip;</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Parts</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">It&rsquo;s not surprising that red is the most common colour is in the set and, along with a good helping of black and grey, provide a good selection of both basic bricks and plates as well as more recent SNOT and bow pieces. There are also some smaller parts in more surprising bright colours like orange, yellow and blue which are hidden away inside &ndash; not at all vital to the look of the train, but they increase the palette available if the model is broken down into parts for use elsewhere&hellip;</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The only unique pieces are the seven &lsquo;half barrel&rsquo; elemts in red that are used for the roofs on all three units. This was the first appearance of the standard train base in white, and it has subsequently only appeared once in a single set &ndash; similarly, the angled white &lsquo;front&rsquo; piece has only had a couple of outings since. Flexi track had been introduced a year earlier and, perhaps a little over excited by their innovation, Lego included 16 of them in this set, along with enough curves to make a full circle, though sadly no straight track pieces at all. There are also all of the essential power functions components included, most of which were fairly new at the time, no doubt accounting for the set&rsquo;s slightly higher retail price.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Minifigures</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Though none of the minifigs are particularly interesting for devotees, the three included fulfil their function nicely &ndash; the train driver is in the usual uniform used in numerous sets since 2006, complete with flat cap. The two passengers (two more than the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7725-1/Electric-Passenger-Train-Set"">12v passenger train</a> had!) both have holiday themed outfits which, while unique in the particular combinations here, have torsos that have appeared in multiple other sets. As a blank canvas for play, they do the job.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The Build</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The build isn&rsquo;t anything spectacular &ndash; it&rsquo;s a City set, and it is pitched entirely correctly to the age range on the box. In fact, it seems to have been designed to get the thing together as quickly as possible which is excusable bearing in mind that (arguably) the pleasure of the set lies in getting the finished model running around the tracks more than the route to get there... The first instruction booklet covers the sub builds which are brief &ndash; the platform is small, basic and similar examples can be found in other passenger train sets, thogh adds a bit of playability even though it only just accommodates the single middle carriage. The signal is a nice addition &ndash; simple to construct (using a click hinge at the base) but really effective and something not often seen in sets.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Starting on the train itself, the second manual covers the front power car and includes several pages dedicated to how the power functions work. The build is basic brick stacking around a skeletal interior designed solely to cradle the battery back and IR receiver. The front is extended outside of the train base slightly in order to accommodate the sloping brick built curve that forms the nose of the train, which is given some aerodynamic shaping courtesy of different angled sloped pieces. The rest of the roof is simple large curved pieces bolted together. The build for the coach is even more basic and the interior still fairly rudimentary &ndash; simple seats arranged around 2x2 brick tables. The final booklet covers the final carriage which mixes the two together, though to no greater excitement than already experienced.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Completed Model and Overall Opinion</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The resulting train is an appealing representation of the type of locomotives in service on suburban train services across Europe and the DNA is clearly visible in several Bombardier prototypes (seriously &ndash; search for &ldquo;red bombardier german train&rdquo; and compare!). The red colour makes it stand out from the yellow freight train released at the same time, as well as from the previous white passenger train.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">To my mind, the mostly brick built approach to the nose on the front and back power cars is far preferable to the more sleek but uninspiring single-piece nose cones on the City passenger train offerings that preceded and followed this set &ndash; the former are more Lego to me, while the latter just make me think of Playmobil&hellip; With this set you can almost trace the development of design cues from the 12v sets that I enjoyed as a child, though I admit that I am probably influenced by a heavy dose of nostalgia and acknowledge that it is not an approach that appeals to everyone!</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">It&rsquo;s a shame that the only track included is a circle and some flexi. The latter is useful when combined with circles and straights to create layouts that break the &lsquo;oval grid&rsquo;, but there is no straight track included and the flexi track is not an adequate substitute (and isn&rsquo;t designed to be). Having said that, the inclusion of power functions and track pieces already pushed the RRP up above what some might consider a reasonable &lsquo;price per piece&rsquo; average, so the selection may have been a budget consideration. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">As an adult I find the lack of carriage doors curious, though arguably this doesn&rsquo;t impact playability as the easy-to-remove roof is an adequate stand in and my daughter sees no particular incongruity getting passengers in and out of the carriage in this way. The traditional train doors would be too tall to maintain a reasonable height when combined with the shape of the roof pieces used, and brick built alternatives similar to those found on the Emerald Night and Horizon Express would probably have been too fragile for the more robust build requirements of a City set. Despite this, I am experimenting with modding some into my set...</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Despite the fact that the build process is relatively unexciting and the minifigures are entirely ordinary, this set still has plenty of appealing features. Being a powered train is exciting enough, and it is as solid and well designed as would be expected. The fact that it consists of a good number of basic elements (roof aside) is inspiring for those who could create something similar (or maybe even better!) from their own parts collection, and it even has some limited value as a parts pack (though probably not at the RRP). It looks great whizzing around the track supplied (even with the flexi included) and fits into any larger layout with ease as it is so easily identifiable as a suburban train common to many cities across the world and therefore fits perfectly in with the rest of the City theme. If you consider a passenger train to be essential to any growing town collection (and I do!), this one fulfils that brief with aplomb.</span></p>
