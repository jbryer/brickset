"AddictedToStyrene","2010-06-05T06:52:20.217Z","Good value for a train/town layout","I liked this set. It comes in four bags, which make a taxi, small shop, and two train station platforms joined by a bridge. The structure is not very solid, but it has a nicely constructed 'girder' look. It is modern looking but would fit well in most settings. <br/>
<p>The taxi is cute. It doesn't have doors, and it has five stickers, but unlike a lot of other four-wide Lego cars, it does sit two minifigs, with two suitcases in the boot (trunk). The passenger doesn't have a seat though - just a space in the back.</p>
<p>The train platforms are six wide and very long, with steps at one end and the bridge at the other. There are two sets of stairs up to each side of the bridge, which is supported on 6 x 4 x 1 cross braced pieces. There is also a cute little ticket machine. </p>
<p>The shop has a sliding 'glass' door and cash register made from a 2x2 computer screen tile on a hinge, and a 2x1 keyboard tile (full qwerty keyboard by the look of it - very useful for offices). The shop has no back, like most small Lego buildings. Good for play, rather than realism. </p>
<p>New pieces include white panels which fit in window frames (like window glass, but moulded in white) and 1 x 3 x 6 panel with curved sides (one clear, one red). </p>
<p>Minifigs are a train employee, a young man with backpack and orange-brown hair, a lady and a taxi driver with a vest and tie. </p>
<p>The set comes with four straight lengths of track in dark grey. It's for RC trains, so they are the same plastic track, not metal topped (Sorry 9v fans). The bridge is also set high enough to let most Lego trains pass underneath. </p>
<p>Good points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four minifigs 
<li>High platform 
<li>lots of details for play 
<li>Nice taxi</li></ul>
<p>Bad points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stickers </p>
<li>
<p>Taxi has no doors </p>
<li>Bridge construction is not very sturdy while you are building it.&nbsp;This might make it a challenge for very young builders. Better to hold the pieces together in your hands as you build&nbsp;than to put pressure on the entire structure before it is complete. <br/><SPAN style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold""></SPAN></li></ul>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"legomakes3","2010-08-14T20:06:14.313Z","Run for the.....Train? Brand New Train Station Review!","<p>All I can say is.....THANK YOU, TLG! We have been waiting THREE LONG YEARS for the newest train station set, and this 2010 installment to the train station LEGO set series is probably the best. Reminds me of a Metro North station with its amazing overpass, ticket machine, stairs, and refreshments shop with a computer and revolving doors!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>*4 awesome minifigs: a train conductor, buisness man/cab driver, buisness women, and college student!</p>
<p>*4 pieces of very long straight track!</p>
<p>*Sleek design that reminds you of a real local train station!</p>
<p>*Very good and balanced color scheme of red, white, black, and grey!</p>
<p>*The cutest little taxi cab you would ever see in LEGO City, included!</p>
<p>*JUST AN AMAZINGLY AWESOME AND WELL DESIGNED SET IN GENERAL!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>*During build, it was hard to connect the parts of the overpass together as one. It would break apart very easily. For a younger builder, this would be complicated.</p>
<p>*The problem with this set is that comes with NO TRAIN! I bought the level crossing set to compensate for this con. A mini train or car would have been nice, or an extra taxi to compensate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite this flaws, the train station is probably the BEST LEGO purchase I have made in 2010! Thank you LEGO for delivering your fans such a wonderful set with much play factor and just such a sleek design!</p>

"Krogh","2010-10-28T15:08:49.58Z","Good set, not great, but good.","This set is a new take on an older set, or at least, it's a remarkable coincidence, if this set is not based of an older set, hehe. I am talking about the old <b>7822 Railway Station</b>, from 1980. I like the design very much, partly because there is an actual real life train station not to far from where i live, that looks very scimilar to this, it has the same basic stair bridge design (allthough not in bright red and white colors, hehe), but there is no longer any store, or ticket office if you will.<div>Seeing as this set has severel parts, i will split the review up accordingly.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Taxi:</b><br>I like the idea of this, but i do think it could have been better executed. It is a pretty basic car, it's built on the same one piece frame, as the <b>8402 Sports Car</b>, and in fact, most other medium sized Lego City cars. So as one would assume, the build is very simple, although, because of the ""odd"" design of the taxi, it is a different building experience than most other cars. As mentioned before i think the design is a bit odd, i think it is to tall, compared to it's width. The taxi fits 2 minifigs, and there's a small room to store the pasengers luggage, a nice detail. As i said, i like the idea of a City taxi, but this attempt could have been done better.<br><br><b>Store/ticket office:</b><br>A small building, containing a few soda bottles (or at least, that's what my imagination says they are), and a computer terminal. That's pretty much all there is on the inside. The outside features a clock, a loudspeaker to announce the arrival of the trains, 2 flower pots, and a lamp post. The best part of this building is, that it has a sliding door, instead of the traditional door. A nice detail is, that one af the walls contain a ""city news"" poster, wich has a small picture of the <b>3221 Lego City Truck</b>. This building actually seperates from the main platform with the stair bridge, a nice feature, that enables the store to be placed on either side of the platform, depending on what fits your city best. Be aware though, that if you place it on the opposite platform, you will have to move the map and the lamppost on that side of the platform, otherwise, they will be right in front of the store entrance. The build is fairly simple.<br><br><b>Platforms and stair bridge:</b></div><div>2 fairly long platforms, with the train tracks between them, there's not very much to say here. One platform features 2 seats for waiting passengers, while the other features a railway map, a lamp post, a bucket (trashcan??), and what i assume is a ticket stand.<br>Then we have the stair bridge itself, and while it looks awesome, and features som excellent parts, it has one big flaw! The railing intended to keep people falling of the bridge, down on the tracks, are barely taller than the minifigs knees. Not very safe, is it? Another thing is, that the stairs them selves has no railings. Oh well, better hope no drunk minifigs try to use the bridge. ;)<br>As i said before, it features some great parts, i dont think iv'e ever seen the sides before (now bare in mind, i am by no means an expert, so i could easily be wrong), so thats great. It also features 2 lamp posts on the top of the bridge.<br><br><b>Minifigs,&nbsp;accessories&nbsp;and others:</b><br>The set comes with 4 minifigs, a driver for the taxi, a female passenger for the taxi, a train conductor (or someone to operate the store), and a traveller. All fairly standard stuff, all great, you also get 2 suitcases, a brown one and a black one, and the traveller comes complete with a backpack. Finally, the set comes with 4 straight track pieces, note that these are not 9 volt tracks, but basic non-conductive plastic tracks.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Conclusion:</b><br>So, i believe i have covered everything. :) Over all this is a very nice train station, with a few flaws, most of wich are pretty easily corrected. I have to be honest, when i first finished the build, i didn't like it very much, but it grew on me pretty fast, so give this set a chance, it might grow on you to! :) I think this will go excellent with the <b>7938 Passenger train</b>, wich might just be my next ""big"" purchase, after i get the small&nbsp;<b>7936 Level Crossing</b>.<br><br>This set recieves a 4/5, i must admit, after never owning any train sets, i am now completely taken by them! :)</div><div><br></div><div>If you like this review, feel free to check out my other reviews. :)</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building Expirence </p>
<p>Great Build the bridge looks non sturdy but it is I very duriable. Ran my '06 passenger train into it didn't&nbsp;even move the bridge&nbsp;by itself &nbsp;made the train break</p>

<p>Parts </p>
<p>Lego used their noggin make this one all the pieces are appropiate to where they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value</p>
<p>I would give 40.00 for it or maybe 45.00 but not 50.00 but dont get me wrong it is a great set</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros And Cons </p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>Station is to small lego should have made it bigger</p>
<p>Platform is to small too you can't really fill the station up</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>TAXI!</p>
<p>Came with 4 track pieces </p>
<p>4 minifigs</p>

"SgtSmash","2010-09-23T18:08:08.997Z","A great fit with the Public Transport set","I do not have any Lego train sets as of yet, but couldn't help but buy this Train Station set, for&nbsp;the ""cool"" factor alone. It's a very eye-catching set, from the color of the bricks right down to the Lego City Truck poster on the side of the snack shop. <br/>The real&nbsp;reason why&nbsp;I bought the Train Station&nbsp;was to go along with the Public Transport set. Together,&nbsp;on two large grey baseplates, they&nbsp;make up a&nbsp;large Transportation Hub for&nbsp;my town. The&nbsp;track supplied with the Train Station gives the light rail train a place to rest while not in use, and&nbsp;all the kiosks, signage, and drop-off/pick-up hubs of the Transport set look&nbsp;terrific combined with everything the Train Station has to offer. Perhaps this wasn't the intention of either set, but&nbsp;that's the great thing about Legos...you can put things however you want, and&nbsp;everything&nbsp;still looks like it belongs.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Anyway, enough about what I did with the set.&nbsp;For&nbsp;$49.99 USD, you get&nbsp;4 minifigs, a taxi, four pieces of straight track,&nbsp;along with some very pleasing&nbsp;features such as the ATM,&nbsp;the&nbsp;train line map, and of course, the snack shop and walkway bridge. Even the backpack for the male minifig is a cool feature and adds to the ""travel"" aspect.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The&nbsp;Passenger Train #7938 is a natural fit with this station, and is something I&nbsp;hope to buy someday,&nbsp;along with a whole lot of track. But if you're like me and have no Lego&nbsp;trains, it still is a&nbsp;wonderful set, and makes a great addition to your town. <br/>&nbsp;",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"fešta","2010-11-04T13:43:17.817Z","It exceeded my expectations","I bought this station, because the previous yellow one was not available&nbsp;any more&nbsp;in the store, and I didn't want to loose time on ebay. I expected an average set, a set that had a lot of empty space, and without a big and fancy station building as we were used in the past.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>That is why I was&nbsp;pleasantly&nbsp;surprised how this station looks great when it is built and how amazing it looks all together when paired with the new red passenger train. The space on platforms enables you to place and play with more&nbsp;mini figures&nbsp;then the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;station. This way your train station can get very busy and it's a lot of fun. The bridge gives a very nice touch to the city skyline, as LEGO City doesn't have many sets with bridges in it. Besides it's fun&nbsp;having&nbsp;a mini figure walking over a train almost like in the mid air :) Taxi is a nice&nbsp;addition&nbsp;to the public transport system, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't expect to find another set with taxi soon.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My suggestion: Take it while you have a chance. :)</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,4
"av8r1973","2011-01-03T10:46:47.927Z","Perfect addition to the train sets","I can't think of actually using the new City train without this train station. &nbsp;Otherwise, it's just a train. &nbsp;The station actually adds visible utility to the city plan. &nbsp;It's relatively sturdy, comes with valuable extra track pieces and some cool minifigs (one with a backpack, one with a satchel).<div><br></div><div>The ticket checking kiosk on the other side, complete with a stub wastebucket, is cool. &nbsp;Great use of components. &nbsp;The stairs and structural components used to build the platform make it pretty stable. I see these being used in other kits. &nbsp;The taxi was a nice addition, as was the luggage. &nbsp;The little convenience store was fun to build, complete with a sliding door.</div><div><br></div><div>The colors work well with the new trains and most of the City color themes, as well. &nbsp;Nice job!</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, pretty cool set. &nbsp;I am glad we got it. &nbsp;A second one will be needed if we expand the trains, but it's on the backburner for now.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Harmonious_Building","2012-03-05T20:21:19.99Z","Station ovation. ","<div>Let me not mince my words: this Train Station is incredible in every respect. It looks fantastic, there’s lots of open space for placing the numerous Minifigs included in the set, and a cohesive collection of detailed extras add a great amount of value to the entire package.</div><div><br></div><div>The problem? This set is absolutely USELESS without Passenger Train (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7938-1"">7938</a>), and probably without a healthy amount of straight train tracks to boot.</div><div><br></div><div>This is LEGO symbiosis at its most insidious and its most inevitable: there’s no point having a train station without a train, and Passenger Train, while very cool, is not nearly as worthwhile without a train station. Therefore, let me assume that you either already own Passenger Train (or a similar set) or have a strong desire to get it and are wondering how well this set complements it.</div><div><br></div><div>The short answer: Train Station complements Passenger Train exceedingly well, and you will be extremely pleased when both of them are put together. If that’s all you wanted to know, then that was the summary right there, because here come the details.</div><div><br></div><div>First off, Train Station comes with four Minifigs, a very healthy amount to populate your burgeoning LEGO town. Of particular note is the female Minifig, who is pretty unique, while the others are somewhat generic but not unpleasant. Sadly, there doesn’t seem to be anyone to run the store next to the train tracks, but I’m sure you’ll find some unemployed bum amongst your citizens who needs a job. A cute accessory that comes with the station is the taxi, which is a simple but effective build, although, much like the car in Car and Camper (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=4435-1"">4435</a>) and many others besides, the taxi unfortunately lacks doors and seats in favour of greater aesthetics, which is a decision that I frankly do not mind whatsoever.</div><div><br></div><div>Now for the Train Station itself. For those who are liable to complain about the platform being too short for the train, you may perhaps be slightly comforted to know that the platform allows itself to be easily modified should you desire a more “realistic” - or, at least, a better scaled - platform. The attached news shop is pleasing and functional, although unfortunately demands an obscene number of stickers in its construction and, as mentioned, does not have an associated worker included in the set. I’m not sure what the little machine on the opposite platform is supposed to be (a ticketing machine, perhaps?), but it breaks up the monotony on the non-shop platform. And the bridge, naturally, looks excellent and allows for the Passenger Train to pass comfortably under it, although, for the record, a Minifig standing on top of the train attempting to pass under the bridge will probably get his head shaved off.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Train Station is both beautiful and functional, and no civilian train set-up can be considered complete without it. My conclusion is that the 2010/2011 LEGO train sets are all pretty amazing, but getting into it may just force you out of house and home. Consider yourself duly warned.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,3,5,5,1
"HuskyDynamics","2022-11-02T17:19:47.79Z","Train Station","<p>Stations are a staple of any LEGO train layout, and 7937 Train Station does not disappoint.&nbsp; If you can overlook the somewhat expensive price (which does make some sense given the large track pieces), it&#39;s a worthwhile purchase.</p>

<h2>Pros:</h2>

<p>The station has extensive sections of open platform, allowing for easy play and minifigure placement.</p>

<p>Bright, eye-catching colours ensure no portion of the station feels dim or forgotten.</p>

<p>The overhead bridge is a cool and unique feature that adds a good amount of height to the build and makes a more impressive display.&nbsp; (The bridge is also tall enough to accommodate any official LEGO train, including of course the High-Speed Passenger Train it was designed to match with.)</p>

<p>Taxi has space for 2 minifigures as well as luggage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cons:</h2>

<p>Many large pieces and repeated assemblies make for a rather forgettable building experience.</p>

<p>As the platform straddles the track, the station cannot be placed too close to a corner for risk of the overhanging nose of a train colliding with it.</p>

<p>Lampposts are easily dislodged.</p>

<p>Space under bridge supports is completely unused (probably realistic but a little disappointing).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend purchasing this set if you have the money (and space on your layout) to spare.&nbsp; It&#39;s a unique and quite eye-catching station design that fits well with passenger rail operations.</p>
