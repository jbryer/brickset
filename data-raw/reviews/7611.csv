"bsquiklehausen","2010-07-04T13:30:53.717Z","Finally, a New Train Crossing!","<p>Finally, a proper train crossing for the RC/PF trains! This set is well priced at $20, and comes with 4 pieces of straight RC track. The Rail/Road excavator is beautiful, and very realistic. It rotates on the same mechanism as the small excavator from the Construction Site (7633), so you can switch them for a&nbsp;better mini excavator. The 1 minifigure is pretty plain, in a railroad workmen's suit. A second minifigure would have been nice, but, since the excavator only fits one, it is understandable. The build is pretty simple, but the parts are great! The gates are decorated using stickers, but that is because the edge or the gates are structural. Now for a list of pros and cons:</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 straight tracks</li>
<li>Mini-excavator</li>
<li>Realistic gates</li>
<li>Wide crossing (2 lanes)</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RC train tracks (no 9V compatibility)</li>
<li>No baseplate makes the crossing break apart easily</li>
<li>So many stickers!</li>
<li>No tools on the excavator</li>

"legomakes3","2010-08-14T19:58:31.747Z","What Your LEGO City Train Yard Needs!","<p>It's a warm August day in Rockefeller Center, New York City. The brand new LEGO flagship store where I purchased this set, as well as the brand new 2010 train station. Now, let me say, this is a GREAT addition to my city collection! It works perfectly with the brand new train station with its awesome crossing&nbsp;mechanics, bulldozer/excavator, and the 4 LEGO RC train tracks it comes with. I&nbsp;got mine for $21.99, a GREAT deal for so many wonderful pieces!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>*Worker minifigure that is accustomed to the theme of the set!</p>
<p>*Excavator/bulldozer that has the coolest mechanics so it can work both on LEGO City road and rail!</p>
<p>*Good amount of track. Great for beginners!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>*Could have had 1 more minifigure or another vehicle. But, hey, I am very happy with the purchase!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LEGO City fans and LEGO Trains fans, buy this brand new collectiable and cool 2010 level crossing kit!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Superbrick555","2010-08-05T22:26:45.65Z","One of the greatest sets of 2010","<p>I got this set at Toys R Us today for&nbsp;20.00 I was highly anticipating building this set. There was one instruction book to this set. And there was a lot of stickers to this set. There is train wheels that can be put town to ride on the rails and there are street wheels to drive around town. The cockpit was very nice looking. I like how it look like it could be used at a construction site. I also liked how it came with a shovel for the digger and a hook. It cool how it came with 4 train track The crossing was very nicely construced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only two cons tho lots of sticker which i dont mind but some people do not like.</p>
<p>And the other one is that when i moved from where i build it to my town one of the crossing beam fell off that is not very well construced it should more brick for more grip.</p>
<p>I thought should have two minifigs and if they had put a seat for the other one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All for all This was one of the greatest sets of 2010. To me this was one of the greatest sets of all&nbsp;time. Great price Great set&nbsp;So go out there today and buy the level crossing at your local toys r us.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"av8r1973","2011-01-03T09:33:21.86Z","We finally have a way to get across the tracks now!","We bought the new City Train set for Christmas, and bought this and the Train Station set at the same time. I &nbsp;am glad we did. &nbsp;The extra track with both sets really helped expand the limited track that comes with the train.<div><br></div><div>The rail crossing is pretty nice. &nbsp;It allows two 4-lug car/trucks to easily cross at the same time. &nbsp;Using 6-lug vehicles is a tight fit. &nbsp;The gentle slopes let all vehicles except my green lowboy trailer from the City Construction set cross over (that one high-centers). &nbsp;The beams and signage are great. &nbsp;They operate smoothly and look pretty realistic.</div><div><br>The excavator is a nice vehicle. &nbsp;It has either a bucket for rearranging railbed materials or a plate that allows the movement of track sections. &nbsp;Since real track doesn't quite come in sections, I left the bucket on. &nbsp;It swivels and rolls nicely on either the rubber tires or the rail trucks that flip down to allow it to drive on the rails. &nbsp;Room for a minifig is about all you get.</div><div><br></div><div>A couple of downsides that detract from the overall playability. &nbsp;First, the ramps for the crossing fall off A LOT! &nbsp;Kids bump the track a bit and they just fall off. &nbsp;A small thin plate would have been nice to hold it all together. &nbsp;Second, the crossing beams are weakly attached to a small plate which is held to the tracks by an even weaker 1x4 plate. &nbsp;If you raise/lower the beams with anything less than absolute perfection, they fall off of the track. Third, the excavator can't get out of the way of the train. &nbsp;Since it's not battery powered, I need to get it off the track to use the train (minor gripe, I know).</div><div><br></div><div>I now know how to construct my own rail crossing using relatively common components, but I wish there was just a rail crossing kit without the vehicle or minifig. &nbsp;It's difficult and unrealistic to get vehicles in and out of the track circle with only one crossing. &nbsp;A $10 kit with just the ramps, smooth pieces and crossing beams would be nice and I would buy a few.</div><div><br></div><div>This one is worth getting just to have the nice crossing. &nbsp;The vehicle and minifig just add to the value.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Loganwan","2011-11-07T20:03:13.33Z","The ever growing Lego Train Line","I am pretty happy with the train crossing.&nbsp;&nbsp; We get 4 straight track pieces, which is always welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The little excavator is great since it covers my love for all things Lego Construction, and Lego trains.&nbsp; The front and rear track wheels work really well, and are such a great gimmick that is different from all other excavators.&nbsp; It was great that they gave us both, a hook and a shovel for the front.<br><br>The crossing itself is simple and straight forward.&nbsp;&nbsp; The crossing arms are something else.&nbsp; They are really well designed and work well.&nbsp; I would love to see a more simplified version of this set with just the crossing, or maybe the crossing with a different vehicle.&nbsp; It would be great to get a few more of these for my city.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,4
"middleton83","2013-02-03T13:57:40.33Z","The engineer and his digger fix the Level Crossing","This model is a lovely addition to your Lego Trains. The main reason why is becuase it is a Level Crossing. This is the second Level Crossing we have had in the Lego City Train subtheme.<br><br>1. The minifigure included in this set has a good design and looks really good working along the tracks and fixing the crossing.<br><br>2. The vehicle included also has a good design, but some slight flaws, which will be explained in the Pros and Cons list.<br><br><br>Pros<br><ul><li>The Level Crossing's design</li><li>The minifigure</li><li>The price</li><li>The track (you can never have enough straight bits of track)</li><li>The diggers design</li></ul>Cons<br><ul><li>The boom bit on the digger, it's not in the middle and slightly awkward during consturction</li><li>Needs a car and second minifigure</li><li>The barriers on the level crossing are flismy and fall off regularly, at the base where they are held in place<br></li></ul><br>
There is only one way this model could be improved, this would be by
adding a second minifigure and a car for the second minfigure to drive.",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
