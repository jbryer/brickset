"Smallsam99","2010-07-31T18:29:21.347Z","Nice addition to a real castle line!","<p>I haven't bought any Lego sets in a while but recently this new line has caught my eye. I seems that Lego has phased out the fantasy castle line in exchange for a fairly decent revival of the old school castle lines. I do like the overall concept of the new line with there being two different opposing sectors and a nice color scheme for both. I think lego finally has a castle line that is realistic and doesn't focus on no ridiculous storyline for once. Now onto the review:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pros</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>two nice minifigures, both a dragon and lion knight</li>
    <li>nice detailing on minifigs</li>
    <li>good assortment of weapons: 2 shortswords, 1 shield, and axe</li>
    <li>extra plumes</li>
    <li>new helmet for dragon knight</li>
    <li>good set for army building</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>I little expensive for 6.99, should be $5</li>
    <li>weapon holder and catapault are kinda useless</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall this is a very good set to get if you want a lego army of knights. I do recommend that you buy this castle line because lego did do a good job on this one. Can't wait till the next series of sets come out.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,4
"Firox_5000","2010-08-27T16:59:58.81Z","Small but excellent set ","<p>I bought this direct from lego for £4.99.</p>
<p>The set includes a red knight with a traditional sword and metalic helmet with red feather on top as well as a&nbsp; evil green knight with a dark silver strong helmet and axe. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set also includes a small but nice little catapult with a new catapult piece which fires tradional stone pieces and also has a lion shield on one side of it. The bad knight has a small sword stand which has a small dark silver sword and golden yellow flag on top too. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For £5.00 it may not be massive but feels very reasonable compared to the prison carriage resque which is twice it's price and actually has fewer pieces. </p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-06T21:29:21.013Z","Stand and Deliver Villain!","<p>Set #7950 Knight's Showdown: I picked up this set today and haven't been dissapointed yet. Although I personally would have preferred seeing the Fantasy Era continue for one more year I can't fault these new Kingdoms sets. (Is it my imagination or is the Castle Theme releasing less and less sets each year?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first exposure to some really nice new accessories came with this set, first of all the axe, it is suitably menacing and cast in a nice dark toned color that may or may not entirely be black. There is a matching sword for the evil knight in this set with the same coloring and it makes for a nice unique uniform color design showcasing the difference between the hero knights and the villain knights of this new theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set also includes a sword and shield for the good knight. You get to build a small catapult with a brand new looking piece (At least to me, I'm not sure if it's been used before.) and it functions quite well. There is also a small weapons stand for the evil knight. You really aren't building much, but what you get in this set is well worth the price. As troop building goes it might be worth it to pick up two or more if you want a cheap army of evil and good knights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a bonus the set includes two of each colored plume, so if you have any Knights with similar helmets missing a plume you can choose to give them a red or green plume. Overall I'd say this set is a worthy addition of any Castle Display.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Sauron_Bauglir","2012-05-23T22:16:55.15Z","What I would expect for the price","<p>I have little to say about this set, but it is what I would expect for NZ$15. Here are the Pros and Cons:</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The Dragon Knight and his equipment are good. I like his axe!</li><li>The definition of a fair battle.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The Catapult is rubbish. It is tiny and can hardly fire.</li><li>The Lion Knight is boring and not very good.</li></ul>
<p>The value for money is fine, and this set will be great for young fans of Lego. It is a good army builder, and I would still recommend you buying it.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,4
"siege","2011-03-11T08:01:45.82Z","Thats a nice flag you've got there!","<p>I bought this set together with 7949 prison carriage rescue and 7948 Outpost attack. The first thing that I saw when I picked the box from the shelf was the artwork. It is just beautiful.</p>
<p>The minifigs in this set are just enough. A lion knight and a dragon knight. Gotta love the dragon knight's face. Lion knight comes with a sword and shield. Dragon with an axe and sword. Would be better if he also had a shield.</p>
<p>The build on this set is easy. No big parts, no stickers, no ropes. Instructions are clear. Not much to say about.</p>
<p><b>The catapult: </b>The highlight of the set. It looks pretty good when finished. The arm looks a bit small compared to the rest of the catapult though. It has two pins where you can put shields, crossbows and things like that on. It hurls its stones farther away then I could ever imagine (about 30 cm), which is pretty good for such a small catapult.</p>
<p><b>The dragons flag stand:&nbsp;</b>Not that great. Can hold the sword or the axe. Does make a good border marker. What I think that could be better is to put a green flag under the golden.</p>
<p>What is great about this set:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Catapult looks good.</li>
    <li>Catapult shoots far.</li>
    <li>Good armament for the lion knight.</li>
    <li>Dragon knights face.</li>
    <li>No stickers! yay!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thing that could be better:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Give the dragon knight a shield.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall a pretty good set. It's worth the 8 euros (or 7,99). You get some nice minifigs, weapons and a good working catapult. Great to do some border conflict scenarios.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Harmonious_Building","2011-12-18T20:09:13.347Z","10th century showdown.","<div>Word on the LEGO street is that many folks found 2010’s Kingdoms line to be unimpressive, and I can sort of see their point of view. Like the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Castle&amp;subtheme=Royal%20Knights"">Royal Knights</a> that preceded them years before, Kingdoms attempted to re-orient the Castle line and cast it in a more realistic light after the wonderful whimsy featured in <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Castle&amp;subtheme=Fantasy%20Era"">Fantasy Era</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I personally happen to think that the Kingdoms sets are mostly excellent, but one counterargument that I would not be able to address would be Knights’ Showdown, a highly mediocre set that would probably not be worth anyone’s time if not for the fact that it were priced at US$7, and, even then, the piece count is not much to write home about. Indeed, the whole worth of this sets rests on the shoulders of the two soldiers who are apparently engaged in the set’s titular showdown, and that by itself makes the set a very difficult sell.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The build here essentially consists of two objects: a sword rack that holds all of one sword, and a catapult that is more like a science fair physics project than a siege weapon. The sword rack is tiny and easily incorporated into Prison Tower Rescue (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7947-1"">7947</a>) as an extra detail, but is really and truly ignorable if left on its own. The catapult is small enough to be laughable, especially when compared against the catapult in Outpost Attack (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7948-1"">7948</a>) or the formidable missile-launching Troll Assault Wagon (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7038-1"">7038</a>). The 2-by-2 barrel lid “wheels” further give the impression that the Lion Knight cobbled this thing together the night before his showdown with his rival, and if that’s the impression LEGO was going for, then I suppose it worked very well.</div><div><br></div><div>The soldiers themselves are decent Minifigs, with one hailing from each clan, of course. Of the two, the Dragon Knight is slightly more impressive with his newer helmet design, but they’re both standard Minifigs that’ll obviously fit in with the rest of one’s Kingdoms display. I do feel compelled to say that the presence of this axe-wielding Dragon Knight is just about the only thing special about this set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I think that Knights’ Showdown is particularly unimpressive when compared to some of its contemporaries. For an extra US$3, Prison Carriage Rescue (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7949-1"">7949</a>) nets you a third Minifig and a functional “evil” vehicle, or, you could pick up the very excellent Blacksmith Attack (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6918-1"">6918</a>) which not only nets you a rarer peasant Minifig but also an entire building. It is these gems and others which made me love the Kingdoms line, but none of that absolves the absolute lack of anything that one gets with Knights’ Showdown. If you can pick this up for cheap, it serves its purpose as augmenting any of the larger Kingdoms sets. On its own, however, it’s hard for me to imagine finding much intrinsic pleasure in it.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,2,3,3,3,2
"Ernst","2012-01-03T14:08:23.503Z","Beware of the Light Artillery","<p>Overall&nbsp;4 bricks: a good stand alone set and a very usefull addition to other Kingdoms set. Priced very friendly and filled with usefull parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks: building is a piece of cake. You built 2 things : a swordrack of 11 parts including the sword for the Dragon Knight and the small catapult for the Kings Knight. It doesn't require higher education. Nice to do so 3 is in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 4 bricks: I give one brick above average because of all the usefull parts. Missing is a shield for the Dragon Knight to defend himself from the bricks which also&nbsp;would give&nbsp;you the opportunity to use the catapult for both parties. The catapult is cute&nbsp;but a&nbsp;bit too small to attack a building (Castle, Outpost, Prison Tower etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks: you can play and have fun with the single set and of course use it with the other Kingdom set, simply good.</p>

<ul><li>The catapult is a nice thing to have in such a small set.

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I wish both sides would get a shield, now there's only one shield - Lion - and if you go by instructions, that's for the catapult (but obviously you can use it for the minifig)</li></ul>

"Hashem1983","2018-08-22T12:33:39.553Z","Nice But Pretty Basic","<p>I found this set by coincidence&nbsp;online and since its almost a decade from its release with price was basically okay when I decided to purchase it, not every time you find an old set with a decent price.</p>

<p>The set comes in a small box with beautiful theme artwork on both front and back, there is an instruction booklet that I did not use because you can assemble&nbsp;it just by looking at picture. The parts are also decent unless you are searching for a special part in a particular color. What I liked most are the 2 metallic swords, one in silver and the other is in dark gray, moreover the battle ax is wonderful as well, although my biggest disappointment or what I have been&nbsp;looking for is to get a spare of each sword or at least one of them. However&nbsp;you get extra plumes of each.</p>

<p>I have read from the reviewers that they would prefer to have another shield for the Dragon Knight and not just only the Lion Knight. If you look at the figures you&#39;ll find that the Lion Knight has no armor&nbsp;like the Dragon Knight, which I felt Lego tried to cut down the price by giving the Dragon Knight a special print than the other figure.</p>

<p>The catapult was a very basic build, but could be quite effective if you hold it. There&#39;s also a side build for the weapon holder which either you put the sword or the ax in it, overall its a basic build.</p>

<p>I have done a simple change on the Dragon Knight, I have replaced his olive green plume with the spare red one and added a red cape on him that made him look even fancier.</p>

<p>All in all, the model itself is pretty basic but it could be useful for any Medieval&nbsp;Theme collection as I have combined it with what I have.&nbsp;</p>
