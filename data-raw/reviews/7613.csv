"Freezdried","2010-05-30T00:23:26.23Z","The jester must be breaking wind...","Apparently flags can move in whatever direction they want to in Legoland, because the two flags on top of the stage in this set go in opposite directions.&nbsp; Other than that annoying design flaw, this set is actually pretty nice.&nbsp; It definitely looks like a medieval stage, like something you'd see at a renaissance fair.&nbsp; And unlike the 'props' you find in other impulse sets, this one actually serves a purpose.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll find a place for it somewhere.<br><br>Let's face it: you aren't going to buy this set for the flags, or the stage - you want the jester.&nbsp; And he's a pretty solid figure.&nbsp; He's got the reversible head with a super-happy face on one side, and a super-sad face on the other.&nbsp; The torso is printed on front and back, with nice detailing (including a lion belt buckle that shows his alliance with the lion knights!)&nbsp; Plus, the LEGO design team once again shows us how innovative they can be with existing parts by using round 1x1 plates for juggling balls.&nbsp; Nice touch.<br><br>As for the building experience, it's easy and not much to talk about.&nbsp; But that's about what you should expect for an impulse set like this.&nbsp; My four-year-old built it on his own without any help, so it's a breeze.<br><br>Overall, I think this is a worthy set to get, but not something you should go out of your way to find.&nbsp; And if you find it on sale, you'd be a 'fool' not to get it!<br>",TRUE,4,2,2,4,3

All by himself, this time performing solo, without any of those boring merry-go-rounds, castles or towers.<br><br>Well, 'boring' might not be the best word here, but really, LEGO couldn't have introduced a better impulse set. The jester is probably one of the most desirable Castle minifigures and now there's finally a way to own him in sufficient quantities to create your own jester-filled circus, without splashing out on a huge set (or tons of them).<br><br>So the flags point in different directions and the build is fragile, so what? It is, at the end of the day, an impulse set and I highly doubt that there'd be too many of you who'd keep the jester's scene as shown. Slopes and brown pieces are always welcome in my parts bin, so I definitely don't have any complaints whatsoever regarding the parts, or the value for money.<br><br>Fair enough, you'd have to be good at juggling yourself if you want this set to even come close to being exciting, but put the jester in proper surroundings and you'll most definitely be in for a treat!<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5

"bogdanst","2010-06-17T04:14:07.373Z","Jester is great","<p>First of all this is an impulse set. That being said, this is a great impuls set! A jester was a rare minifig, first came in advent calendar (which was a seasonal set, so after christmas, it was mostly unavailable), than came in a big set (which was perhaps out of reach for those that didn't want to spend a lot of money to get yet another tower, with more knights, just for one minifig - ok, the lady in distress in that set was also a nice touch, and maybe would make that purchase a worthwhile). Now everyone can have their own jester, because you will buy this set for the minifig and nothing else, or you won't buy it at all.</p><br><p>And a word or two about the stage - the stability is not that bad, round bricks go into the plate, on the plate you have those slopes, and on the slope you have a 1x6 plate - there is nothing unstable about that. The flags are not representing flags in that set, well not flags that wave on the wind, anyway. They are a stage decoration, or maybe a stage curtain, so them facing opposite direction is not a violation of physics. Just a small imaginative detail for the impulse set (and impulses always have parts that are pretending to be something else, because they have a limited number of parts that are put into these sets).</p><br>Jester is a must-have minifig, so the price is not that high (consider the rarity of a jester, and then compare it to the common wizard that comes in the second impulse set, at the same price). The stage is nicely designed for an impulse set, well not very hard to build - but still. The printing on the jester is great (only, my headpiece has a slight color smudge, but nothing noticeable). And the playability is just individual ;) <br><br>But I highly recommend this set to everyone, since you can't go wrong with a jester.<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

"AETerry","2010-10-13T14:39:15.18Z","Court Jester Review","<div class=""description"">This is or was the cheapest set and way to get a Jester Minifigure for Castle. I can see placing this set in a medieval type fair where he's entertaining a crowd. How else to explain the stage that he's standing on?<br></div>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are printed on a folded sheet of paper, either side with LEGO's clear step-by-step illustrations.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's only 22 pieces in this set, most of which are red and white to complement the colors of the Jester's outfit.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Court Jester is the main draw and feature of this set and I must say he is well worth it. Unlike Harley Quinn who is red and black or another Jester in the Fantasy Era theme that's blue and red, this particular Jester is red and white, complimenting him well with the colors for the Kingdoms theme.</p><p>Its for this minifigure alone, that makes buying this small set worth it.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>As a small set, there's really not much of a build. You've got just enough pieces to make an alternating red &amp; white stage that the Jester stands on while he's juggling his round 1x1 plates or balls.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Where so many Castle sets feature Castles, Towers, War Wagons and Vehicles and army building minifigures, the Court Jester adds a flair of character and whimsy, reminding people that Castle wasn't all about sieges and wars, there are other aspects to the Castle theme. At $5 picking this up from Brickcon, this set was well worth it to me. If you love Jesters, this set is a must to get. So many possibilities with him outside of keeping him just straight Castle too for play and MOC building.<br></p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,4
"clundsberg","2010-10-06T23:18:16.727Z","Doin' It All For The Jester","<p>I bought this set today as a gift to get my son&nbsp;the Jester figure and becasue the store did not have any of those single pack secret figures.&nbsp; Let's face it, the figure is the main draw for this set.&nbsp; Legoland exemplified this in their 3-D movie so I'm very glad they made an affordable set in which to obtain this figure.</p>
<p>The simple stage he juggles upon is a nice touch.&nbsp; It makes sense in context&nbsp;and can be added to any castle set nicely.&nbsp; It bothers me not that it's a pretty basic set as&nbsp;again I think most people that buy this set are doing so for the figure.</p>
<p>If you have $5 on you and want a nice treat for yor child or want to add to your sets on a budget this is for you.</p>
<p>The unique figure is a the main plus of this set, unless you have a child in which case their expression at receiving this is the true reward. :)</p>
<p>Thank you, Lego for making a rare figure easily accessible. (now where's that Admiral Ackbar?)</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T16:18:53.873Z","Did you Hear the One about the King and his Horse?","<p>Set #7953 Court Jester: Another Impulse set that is one of the better ones. I finally picked this up today after months of waiting and biding my time and I was not dissapointed. This set is well worth the money, it gives you a small stage to put your Jester on and of course the much coveted Court Jester Mini-Figure, a rare figure indeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a cheap little alternative to paying for the larger sets if you're only interested in the Court Jester. As a bonus he comes with a double-sided torso and head, and the unique looking cap is a nice accessory. You get two of each colored stud to use as juggling balls, and some jugglers can juggle all six of them, sadly not the LEGO Jester. (At least not without a bit of support from you the player.) I highly recommend this set to anyone who enjoys the Castle theme.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"alva","2011-10-31T01:57:08.92Z","A Simple Impulse with a Great Impact","As you know, people on middle age (during the castle era) does not have many entertainment. They do not have TV, radio, internet, etc. So, the choice of entertainment was very limited at that time. One of entertainment that available at that time is clown/jester. So, really happy that Lego launched this impulse. It really make the castle theme more alive and more real. You can put him and the stand anywhere in your castle and put some minifigs to watch him. Really nice.<br>In term of design, I love how Lego create the set with half red half white color. I think it is really complement each other, and also matching with Lion Knights color.<br><br>If you have some castle/kingdom sets, you should have this set, at least one, and it will make your middle age city more fun.<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,3,2,4,5

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Simple, the boxart is just the Jester standing on the podium while juggling three studs.&nbsp; The instructions are a little flyer which really streches out building the podium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Very basic parts, nothing really to discuss, which is standard for most impulses&nbsp;(not until the minifigures section at least).&nbsp; It does come with some extra ""balls"" though, nice to have some extras.&nbsp; The only real problem I have with the simple structure is the color scheme.&nbsp; Though it is my first golden flag, a white on would have matched the red/white coloring better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Here we go, the reason to get this set, the Jester.&nbsp; The legs are simple non-printed minifig legs except one leg is colored red to fit the colors of the lion knights.&nbsp; The torso is the same as the <em>Fantasy Era </em>jester's except instead of blue printing, it has white.&nbsp; The face is probably my favorite part of figure.&nbsp; It is a double face, one side with an annoyingly large smile, the other with an expression of the jester crying, which really reminds me of the <em>Comedy </em>and <em>Tragedy </em>masks from ancient Greece.&nbsp; And if you would like to know, the face is what inspiered me to call this review <strong>Moodswing.&nbsp; </strong>The hat is the one thing that bugs me and I am sorry to waste your time with this, but it messes up the pattern.&nbsp; (From the right side of the 'fig feet to hat, we have white, red, white, white [, and the little red ball].&nbsp; This problem did not exist on&nbsp;his <em>Fantasy Era </em>counter part.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Nothing really worth while.&nbsp; It'll take longer to read this review then to build it.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Not much, just a little stand, which despite it's occupation, is a horrible stand alone set.&nbsp; Though I admit that as of today (1/14/11) it is my only <em>Kingdoms </em>set besides the wizard.&nbsp; It would go nicely with <em>Medievel Market Village </em>or the 2010 castle.&nbsp; I actually use it in my city as a street performing stand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>To summarise this, I will close my review.&nbsp; Simply only get it for the minifig, though his pattern is messed up, the white/red color scheme is much better than the blue/red one.&nbsp;But keep in mind that it is just an impulse set and not really worth being tracked down now that it has been discontinued.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,1,4
