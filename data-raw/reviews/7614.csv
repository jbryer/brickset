I bought at my local TRU for $4.50 (overpriced as heck!), since they usually have late summer sets early on. There are many neat parts, like the new baby dragon and the printed 2x2 tile. The printed tile even has a text, which reads: 'You are far more powerfull than you would ever imagine...' The Wizard himself is pretty cool, with printed legs and headgear. His torso however isn't printed, but it doesn't really matter because his beard is covering most of it up. Now to the Pros and cons:<br />

"Lego_Minifig_Man","2010-08-14T17:59:42.19Z","Who are you? Oh, you must be Dumbledore's evil twin.","<p>I bought this set at Wal-Mart. I almost bought 7566 Farmer, but I chose this instead. I am trying new ways to review, so let me know if you like the way I reviewed this set!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigure (Wizard)</strong></p>
<p>The wizard has the symbol and colors of the umm... evil knights. His torso is only green, which even though it's hidden by the beard, is kind of dissapointing. His legs are very similar to Dumbledore's in 5378 Hogworts Castle, but if you compare them the print is different. His hat is great, and his beard is the first black beard I got. His head has a&nbsp; different color hair than the beard (gray). He comes with a wand that's the same piece used in all the Harry Potter sets, and I think it's fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Table</strong></p>
<p>The tabletop is an 2x4 flat brown peice. The legs are good, but they are a darker brown. On the table is this really cool dragon&nbsp;(Who I named Norbert. A Harry Potter joke)&nbsp;which, when placed correctly, can fit on the wizard's hand. Also on the table are two potion bottles made from clear bricks; Nothing special. It would've been nice if lego had made&nbsp;new peices molded to make bottles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Map Stand</strong></p>
<p>This stand is horrible. It could've been made with much simpler peices, but lego made it all complicated-looking. Though on the bright side, you do get some good peices. The map is really cool. It has a picture of the evil knight's dragon symbol thing. At first, I thought they did a bad job because of the brown around it, but then I thought that brown could've been part of the stand, which makes it awesome. It is also written on ripped parchment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What the Map Says</strong></p>
<p><em>You are far more powerful than you could ever imagine...</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<p>The instructions is only a one sheet folded peice of paper with pictures of other sets on the other side. The extra peices are a red clear stud and a green clear stud. There is a lot of playability <strong><em>if you have other sets.</em></strong> For example, he could be part of your evil knight army. Or a miscellanous Harry Potter wizard. There was no trouble with the building experience, but it is nothing special and can be done quickly and easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This set if actually pretty good. I would be more comfortable with the price if it was&nbsp;$2 or $3,&nbsp;but, oh well. You should buy this if you have a lot of Kingdom sets, particularily if you have some of the evil knights, or if you have some Harry Potter sets. If you do, buy it now!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having missed out on the The Good Wizard Impulse set from the earlier Fantasy Era for whatever reason (I never saw it or the Troll Warrior set on Canadian Store Shelves.) I was bound and determined to pick up this Wizard. It's a good little set and it has some interisting and unique new pieces. The Wizard himself is a brand new torso with a color that contrasts nicely with the other Wizards (Though I only have a couple of Majistos to compare him to physically.) the new black beard piece is nice... At least new to me. I'm not sure if it was available in that color in any past sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two small models built with the Wizard set include a magic potion holding table, complete with baby dragon and a small moveable stand to hold the new magic scroll piece. This magic scroll piece is a great improvement to the old Castle magic scroll piece, that one didn't have any actual writing on it in English, just some script made to look like magical runes. This one has a nifty little phrase written out in English so your Wizard can recite the spell while you're playing with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that both Kingdoms Impulse sets are definitely must have items. Here's hoping that LEGO will produce a few more of these next year with perhaps an evil Witch returning to do battle against the Wizard.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5

His colour scheme also allows him to blend in with the Trolls - a traitor to humanity, perhaps? &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Now, when is LEGO going to stop teasing us with individual wizards and instead give us an entirely magic-based faction for Castle?&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
