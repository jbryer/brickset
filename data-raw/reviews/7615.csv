"Paradoxymoron","2009-12-24T17:12:18.547Z","Mini 8075","This is a mini version of 8075 Neptune Carrier.It has two new pieces- 2 1X3 tiles in red. There are also 2 1X1 red bricks with studs on only one side, I'm not sure if thes  are new or not. Now, for the pros and cons.

Pros:
Looks awesome
Resembles 8075 quite well
new pieces
2X2 curve things in trans neon green
Fairly sturdy
just overall coolness

Cons:
aside from the fact that mine came with a broken piece, none.

Another quick thing that I wasn't sure whether to put in the pros or cons: It's actually bigger than I thought it would be.

I would suggest getting this set if you aren't in the US or you don't get BrickMaster. It's worth it.

"Stayontargetprod","2009-12-29T21:53:53.357Z","One of the better brickmasters","I have to say. This set was fun to build. It had 2 new pieces and 4 that were new to me. Lots of rare red and cool pieces.

Pros
2 new pieces
propeller thing
trans green pieces
good extras
fun build

Cons
Wing light things fall off a lot
When you try to take off one piece. The whole thing 'explodes.'
Only a propeller on one side

Good set. I'd give it a nine but of a 4 or 5, it gets a 4. It isn't a very high 9.
Go to Stayontargetprodalt's youtube channel to find a video review of it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Danblom","2010-02-11T08:48:26.5Z","BrickMasters Ahoy!","Into the depths you can go!  Great little set, though there is only a propeller on one side.  Using incredible SNOT (Studs Not Only on Top) tech., I would rate 4/5.  It also comes with the new earling brick which is a 1x1 brick with a stud on the side.  Great set!  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Squidtron","2009-12-30T17:52:57.56Z","If you need small amounts of neptune carried then I'm hired.","Actually, I have no idea why the big version of this set is called Neptune Carrier, because there is no substance called neptune. Anyway enough of that , this set is small and interesting it has some new and cool parts but it could have used a monster of some kind.

Now for the Cool/Not Cool things about this set.
Cool Parts(+1)
Looks Nice(+2)
Very Swooshable*(+2)
Needs a Monster(-1)

AND THE GRAND TOTAL IS... 4/5 nice

You should buy this set but you can't because its a Brickmaster Exclusive.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zilleonti","2010-01-31T21:31:45.34Z","The first set I got in the mail.","As the title says it was the first Lego Set I've gotten in the mail. I actually enjoyed putting this one together (aside from dropping the transparent round pieces on the floor, lol). I was expecting something smaller so I was surprised on the size of it when it was complete. There are a few pieces that are new to me.

Pros:
I love the Transparent ""Neon"" Green curved 2x2 pieces.
Rotating Propellar
Quite hefty for being only 63 Pieces.

Cons:
Seems incomplete with only one Propellar
Could of came with 1 Minifigure.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
