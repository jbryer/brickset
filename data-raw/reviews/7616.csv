<p></strong>The must have and highly anticipated set for 2H2010 Technic fans and it is definitely the best Technic set I have owned as far as playability and functionality, only second to the 8455 Backhoe Loader from 2003.&nbsp; Funny thing is as of 7/15/2010 only UK Lego <a href=""mailto:S@H"">S@H</a> had it available, it wasn't available in the USA, but Toys R Us had all the 2H2010 Technic sets available in my local TRU.&nbsp; Funny they would receive them before the Lego distribution center in the USA had it available to order.&nbsp; This set rivals the 8275 RC Bulldozer from 2007 in terms of functionality.&nbsp; It is a very large model when complete, but a very satisfying building experience and even when not playing with it, it looks excellent set on a shelf for display.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Tons of functions, complex satisfying building experience, looks very elegant much like a real-life excavator, rivals the 8294 Excavator from 2008 mainly because it is completely remote-controlled and has the needed 3rd linear actuator to operate the bucket tilt.&nbsp; Kudos to the Lego designer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Not much here except for the high price, $199 US dollars is steep, but with all the power functions included I can see the price point being realistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Power functions M-motors a little weak in operating the bucket tilt, boom raise and lower and the boom extension, but the motors for operating the forwards, backwards,&nbsp;turning and rotating of the superstructure are very smooth and fast indeed.&nbsp; Bucket seems a bit oversized as did the bucket for the 8294 Excavator, but Lego only seems to have 3 bucket sizes nowadays and it is the same one as on the 8265 Front-End Loader from 2009 and the front bucket on the 8455 Backhoe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In closing, this is a must have for any Technic collector.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

"bereft","2010-08-07T18:32:46.1Z","Marvelous set","<p><p>The 8043 set is what 8275 (Motorized Bulldozer) should be in 2007. While having the same four motors Power Functions system (the only significant difference is using 4 M motors instead of 2 M + 2 XL) the Motorized Excavator are truly designed for action. It drives rather slowly, but tracks help to overcome significant obstacles, like house slippers. Due to very complicated co-axial drivetrain from motors to &nbsp;tracks excavator tends to turn left slightly while travelling a long distances, but it justifiable for the superstructure being able to rotate infinitely. Movements of boom, bucket and arm is quite jerky, but again, the number of gears (more than 10 for every function)and overall complexity of the structure make me forgive some playability imperfections. Al in all this set will definitely not going only to stand on the display shelf.&nbsp;</p><p>Building experience is quiet interesting as it all about gears. Co-axial drivetrain for the tracks and motor-switched gearbox for six functions being driven by three motors are the innovations of the decade, everything else we could see in other recent Technic models. Building process is not so exciting as in case of 8421 or 8880 sets, but also isn't boring, as it gives us a new idea of drivetrain complexity. In terms of parts this set will provide technic fan with 4 linear actuators, 4 motors, 2 IRs and a plenty of gears. Decorative panels are also in abundance.&nbsp;</p><p>The price tag may seem ridiculous for the toy (more than 300 USD here in Belarus), but I think that over several years this set will share fate of 8421, 8285 and other successful sets of not so distant past. If you keen on Technic theme, buy it immediately. This set is surely the best LEGO Technic in recent 5-7 years and rivals such legends as 8880, 8480 and 8455.&nbsp;</p></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4

This is an incredible set and took me 5.5 hours to build and just take your time. 200.00 and it's worth every penny. Just make sure if you have the motorized bulldozer<br>you set the all the addresses differently on the remotes if you plan to play with both of them at the same time :-) (having a brother does that) It was fun to build and I'm 26 but hey it's challenges you and makes you so much more efficient in the real world as far as thinking outside the box! The only complaint I would have is that it is a slow moving machine going forward and backward and the bulldozer is much quicker. Pick it up because toys r us has them and grab 2 or 3 because they are running a special buy two sets get one free! I picked up three because in three years this set will triple in price and I will sell it on ebay new in the box and I'll have two.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"adam85","2010-09-03T08:15:20.403Z","Most complex Technic set","Despite the problems mentioned in some Lego forums I decided to buy this set.<br>The box is the same size as the 8258 Crane Truck. There are three instruction book. The building steps are very clear but you should look every step carefully and check the working features during the building because the functions easily can go wrong. The set has a lot of useful pieces: tons of gears (there are lot of clutch gear!) beams new and old panels, four M-motors, two receivers, two controller, four (!) linear actuators. <br>The build took me 7-8 hours. The building process is very interesting there weren't any boring part. The model is very complex. And you have to work in a small space (gearbox) which makes it hard and challenging. The gearbox is the most difficult part of the model. I advice to check every axle and gears moving freely before completing. <br>When I finished the model I was afraid that it won't work. But it works! The only problem is that the main arm (which powered by the double linear actuators) raise slowly, but it is not completely useless. The lowereing of the main arm is better. Other functions works fine.<br>The model is very playable so dont worry about that. I suggest you to buy this if you like large and complex Technic models. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

I think part of the reason it took so long for me to build is simply b/c i enjoyed playing and tinkering with the gearsets as i put them together to get a better understanding of how it was all going to work.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Ok, as we all know,&nbsp;when first released the LA's for the main&nbsp;arm weren't strong enough&nbsp;to lift the arm. Other than that flaw and some people having issues with the traveling speeds of the tracks (mine works flawlessly there), this thing was cherry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a nice package in the mail today from lego containing FOUR brand new LA's to replace all of them on the excavator AND 4 other little parts that are to be used to fix the flaw with the traveling that some people have. After swapping to the new LA's I'm definately much happier. Granted, the main&nbsp;arm still isn't exactly fast, but that is a lot of&nbsp;weight/leverage on the LA's. However, the motors don't struggle nearly as bad now.</p>

<p>I understand why they made the bucket wide for the B model, but its just too bad. Its the only thing that detracts from the&nbsp;realistic&nbsp;look. The price seems high compared to 8275, which had more pieces and XL motors for $50 less, but I know times change and this was probably more complex to&nbsp;design. The stickers are cool, I just don't know how they will play out for long term collector like myself. In all, a must have for anyone that likes Technic and earthmoving equipment!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4

Bucket size is out of scale - it's a dozer bucket. &nbsp;For the price, a narrower bucket could have been created and used on other LEGO kits    Boom is pretty wobbly, but it's a limitation of the components used and the friction fit of them all.        &nbsp;Though I notice now that the Con list is longer than the Pro list, I also notice the severity of the Cons is pretty low. &nbsp;A service pack is apparently available and I have requested one from LEGO. &nbsp;This is a wonderful kit to assemble, disassemble, reassemble into the B-model and then reverse the process again. &nbsp;Loads of fun!

This economy doesn't look good on a flagship model.</div><div>On the positive side, we have quite a lot of Power Functions elements.

<h4>The build</h4><div>Very good and challenging building experience. Following the instructions there is no issue in completing the model.</div>

"Bram","2011-01-06T02:25:24.037Z","8043 tips, myths and facts","<p>When a set could bring an adult after 20 years of Lego absence..it must be something special. Well because it is.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I bought the newer edition set with the updated LAs and instructions. I'd read about the earlier production having&nbsp;issues with the LAs.&nbsp;Even with the new updated LAs, few are still having problems. This is more to the builder's issue..not the set's<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The 8043 is an advanced model, it requires more than just simply following the booklet. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Here are few tips for&nbsp;building a smooth operating and powerful&nbsp;8043 not found on the booklet! :)<br/>1. Watch the gears! Make sure when you insert the gears or when the gears are positioned between two objects (eg. beams), give a slight play/tolerance..and spin them to make sure they spin freely.<br/>2. Align the universal joints on both ends of each axle. This will further reduce vibration when operating the dipper and bucket.<br/>3. This is optional, use light silicone oil LIGHTLY on the gears, this reduces friction by A LOT. Silicone oil is safe for plastics, clear in color, when applied properly will not ruin the cleanliness of your LEGO.<br/>4. Align the LAs on the boom when it's under load. You need to calibrate the gears so you have perfect alignment. This will lighten the load as the LAs are not 'forcing' against each other.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>If you've done the above 'tuning', all these myths below are busted.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The 8043 myths:<br/>1. The M motor is not powerful enough for this model even with the updated LAs.&nbsp;<br/>Fact: this is a complete non sense! My 8043 performs admirably well. I can lift the boom with a small Technic 8047 mini excavator tied on the bucket, at full arm extension. How much more powerful do you need?<br/>&nbsp;<br/>2. Swapping to XL motor will give a faster boom raise/lowering. <br/>Fact: the XL motor is in fact slower than the M motor despite the superior torque. I've watched upgraded 8043 on Youtube, I can lower and raise the boom just as fast on the M motor. Unless you want to lift a big chunks of rock LOL and destroying the gears and LAs.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>3. Alkalines are better because of higher voltage<br/>Fact:&nbsp;The high ampere draw of this model will do MUCH better with high performance rechargeable Ni-MH AA batteries or the Lego 8878 LiPo battery. These batteries despite their lower voltage, gives&nbsp;superior torque,higher&nbsp;discharge rate&nbsp;adequate for&nbsp;the hardworking M motors in this set.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Verdict : This model is targeted more towards AFOLs, you need a basic understanding of mechanics to make this model perform well. Overall this is a great buy, and this 32 y.o. AFOL can't stop playing with his 8043 hahahaha.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Cheers.</p>

"aldredd","2015-01-16T11:09:52.433Z","An absolute must for any Technic Fan","<p>Having initially been put off this set my the second price it goes for, I was lucky enough to pick it up from someone for &pound;75. Few bits missing, but nothing I couldn&#39;t pick up easily enough.</p>

<p>From the build, through to the admiring and playing, this is one of the all-time greats - a must have set. Read on to find out why!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are many stand out parts in this set. With 4 large LA&#39;s controlling that arm and bucket, 2 IR remotes, 2 IR receivers, and a whopping 4 Medium Motors. You also get all those tracks, and that huge buckets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As with all other tracked technics vehicles, they start with the tracked undercarriage - which is usually the repetitive&nbsp;bit. But even in these early steps they excite with the gearing required to control it. It won&#39;t be long until you&#39;re working on the heart of this build - the mammoth&nbsp;gear box - this build uses around 70 gears in total, most of them within the main gear box, and along with those 4 M motors, dominates the entire superstructure.</p>

<p>When I know I&#39;m going to buy/build a certain set, I try and avoid reading too much about it - I love building and trying to work out what&#39;s what - and there are stages where you&#39;re really left wondering where they&#39;re going with something - a fascinating&nbsp;build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Wow - just Wow. This is a fully motorised set. You use the remotes to to control the movement of the excavator, and the raising / lowering and rotating. You can&#39;t control both arm / rotating and general movement at the same time, you have to engage the correct driving ring to switch over. However, here it trumps again, as the switch over itself is also controlled by the remote - you don&#39;t need to touch the model once you&#39;ve turned the battery box on.<em> (As a side note, a new driving ring setup has been produced which offers more resistance when changing (to stop slippage) - be interesting&nbsp;to see if something similar to this setup can still be created with this new ring / clutch gear config)</em></p>

<p>When it comes to play - I don&#39;t tend to do so with my models - I admire, I fiddle, I photograph etc. This set however, exists to play with! Take it around the house, annoy the wife, let the kids have a go - most fun I&#39;ve had out of a set yet.</p>

<p>It can be pricey - but buy used and you can get it for around the original RRP, which is well, well worth it. Yes, it &#39;could&#39; be better - and there is a fab Mod to it available on rebrickable, but that would have bumped the price up significantly. And to be honest, it doesn&#39;t need it - it&#39;s a great set as it is, and you won&#39;t be disappointed with it.</p>

Beyond this, one would be hard-pressed to find fault with the model. The gears mechanism is a wonderfully complex case study of routing mechanical power to the actuators. The chassis operation through the turntable is ingenious. And the thing looks and works for the most part like a real excavator. It's a joy to build and brings a great sense of accomplishment when complete. <br><br>So, to sum it all up... This is a must have for any Technic fan. So, go, get it already.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"ptf","2013-04-26T16:27:59.843Z","Probably the best Technic set ever","<p>The first set I bought after DA in 2012. Resisted 8421, then 8275, then 8265 and 8258 but this one was too much for me.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>build - superb gearbox and technical solutions makes it interesting and challenging building experience - (in my opinion better than 8275)</li><li>parts - lots of PF parts and gears + tracks (also better than 8275), very good base for MOCs</li><li>excellent A model ( even better when equipped with 42006 claw :) )&nbsp;</li><li>excellent B model</li><li>playability - second to none (both models)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>a little bit slow A model - but that's the way excavators move I guess</li></ul>
<p>It is probably the best Technic set ever produced (ex aequo with 8110 Unimog), must have for every Technic fan. Too bad it is out of production now, so it gets more and more expensive.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"odueck","2012-08-12T14:13:19.693Z","Pricey, but an excellent fully-functional set","This is the first Technic set I have built in many, many years. As such, the vast majority of the parts were new to me so it was a very interesting build. It took me just over five hours to complete.<div><br></div><div>Unfortunately, I managed to make three mistakes. The first was minor, but too late to correct. It was not a functional problem though, so I kept building. The second was also minor and I was able to fix as soon as I caught it. The third was more major. I left out a gear which means I can't raise/lower the crane arm. So I will have to rebuild. But that's my own fault.</div><div><br></div><div>I love the design of the functionality of this set. The gearbox is incredibly intricate and it's crucial that you are careful to ensure all the gears work as they are supposed to.</div><div><br></div><div>My only disappointment with the functionality is that the actual back/forward movement of the crane is very slow. But that's a minor quibble.</div><div><br></div><div>This set is expensive at $249.99 CAD. I was able to get a relatively good deal by ordering from amazon.co.uk, but it can also be had for $200 at TRU which is fairly reasonable. The functionality certainly makes up for the high price.</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, this is a very impressive set.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Victor_c3","2012-08-13T10:17:55.297Z","Most amazing set I've ever owned","<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">This is the second set I've bought since the 1990s, the other set being the 8421 (mobile crane) that I picked up in 2007. I have to say that lego technic has come a LONG way since my childhood and has made some pretty modest progression since even 2005. This set represents the pinnacle of what I'd expect lego to be. And, in short, this is by far the most amazing lego set I've ever owned.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">At first, I cringed at the idea of spending $200 (MSRP) on roughly 1100 pieces when I could have picked up a 2100 piece&nbsp; 8110 (Unimog) for the same price. However, seeing that this set has been on the market for 2 years and it was on my ""wish list"", I figured I better pick it up while I could still find it from regular retailers online. I mentioned this in my review of the 8865 (test car), but when you adjust the price of the 8865 in 1990 (which was roughly $115 in 1990 [$187 in 2010 dollars], if I remember correctly) it is right in line with the 8043 - and you get a lot more bang for your buck with the 8043 with the 4 motors, 2 IR sender/receivers, a battery bot, two remotes, 4 linear actuators,... So, to actually issue an opinion, I believe you get a lot for your money with this model when you take this into consideration.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">Almost every review that I've read&nbsp;mentioned that the shovel is the one major aesthetic shortcoming of the model. Honestly, I think lego could have done better with a new piece, but the one that comes with the model&nbsp;is just fine. Playing with the model firsthand, I didn't even really notice it.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">The one thing that surprised me was just how strong the linear actuators were. I don't think&nbsp;under normal&nbsp;play that you could actually break a linear actuator.&nbsp;Also, the motors themselves have a lot of power for being as small as they are and they definitely out perform the motors that I was playing with circa 1990. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">Playability of this model is what I think makes it stand apart from anything that I've ever owned or played with. I didn't think the motors were underpowered by any means and all of the moving mechanisms were very robust. Sure, the vehicle doesn't move that fast and the arms could move a little faster, but you made this thing out of legos. If you want a toy that can move and dig like a real excavator and that you can put in a sandbox, go buy a purpose-built toy.&nbsp;However, if you enjoy moderately complex lego models that you can put together and tweak yourself and then see how the functions work, this is the way to go. The fact that a lego model is being compared to a purpose-built toy by other reviewers above is very telling of the quality and design of lego products. If you can put something together yourself out of a pile of little plastic pieces and have it in any way comparable to a purpose built toy designed by engineers and built in a factory then&nbsp;I think you have something very special.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">Complexity and design has come a long ways since the models that I played with circa 1990. The gearbox and power transmission portion of the model, although not new (i.e. the Jennifer Clark model mentioned in another review) are a joy to put to together and to see how it works. I've seen/read a lot of complaints in the past over the move from studded to stud-less design. At first I disliked the stud-less design, but after playing with the newer models, I believe that you can pack a lot more functionality into a much smaller place and make mechanisms that you couldn't with studded pieces. This model is a perfect example of that.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">With this model I've notice more and more that lego is color coding more and more of their pieces. When I was playing with my legos circa 1990, all gears were grey, all axels were black, all pins were grey or black, bushings were grey, etc. However, now you have all even numbered axels are black, odd are grey, #2 axels are red, you have tan axels with stops, dark grey gears, light grey gears, tan gears,... At first I thought the colors were excessive, but after assembling the model and sifting through a sea of parts, the color coding really does help with the assembly. Additionally, when you are playing with the model, it is easier to follow the transmission of power through the model(s). So, I guess I like the color coding. It makes a lot of sense to me.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">The only thing I don't like are the panels and large pre-fabricated pieces like that. I'd rather make my own panels from a bunch of smaller pieces, but I suppose that a pre-fabricated panel is cheaper to produce (i.e. keeps the model half-way reasonably priced) and also is more robust (won't fall apart during play). However, as much as I don't like them, they aren't that bad.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"">So, after writing all of this, what is my verdict? Pull the trigger and buy this model! It is a pleasure to build and a lot of fun to play with. I put this model together on a Saturday, played with it with my 4 year old daughter all day Sunday, and I disassembled it Monday so that I could repeat the process again.</SPAN></p>
