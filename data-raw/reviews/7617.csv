"Duq","2010-06-22T20:09:08.123Z","Less is more!","From the very first leaked pictures I knew I wanted to get this set so I was very happy to find it in Copenhagen airport last week.<br><br>There aren't many Technic motorbikes so it's obvious to compare it to its predecessor, the 8420 (there was a dirtbike two years ago but that wasn't in the same league). At first glance you get less of everything; fewer parts, fewer cylinders, no windscreen, a shorter bike and a smaller rear tire. So is this a step back?<br><br>Building the bike is trickier than building Technic cars because everything is at strange angles but apart from that there are no special challenges. The parts are in a handful of bags. My eight year old son built it and he hardly needed any help. Interesting techniques are the longer connecting rods for the pistons and the use of the rubber 1x2 axle connector to fix a construction where the geometry just wouldn't fit with rigid parts.<br><br>The set contains some parts that are new for 2010 such as the smooth panels, the long pin with hole in the middle and most obviously the new wheels. These wheels are the same size as 8420's front wheel but are symmetrical. They also have pin and axle holes in the rim. Unfortunately the rear tire is the same width as the front on this bike. <br>It's a nice selection of parts with -for a motorbike set- a good few gears, including the 40t at the rear. Interestingly the mudguard part from the previous bikes is used here to shape the tank.<br><br>Once built you notice how detailed this bike is, especially compared to 8420. This time we get instruments, footpegs with gear and brake lever and an exhaust system. Strangely the mirrors are missing. The bike is well proportioned and looks like a proper streetfighter. The front has suspension but that doesn't work very well. Even when you push on the handle bars you still compress the rear suspension, not the front.<br>The engine is interesting as it's a parallel three-cylinder, like in the Triumph Speed Triple. Unfortunately there was no way to make 120 degree cranks so the outer two pistons move in sync which isn't very realistic. Having said that it's not very obvious as the cylinder heads are hidden below the tank.<br><br>The second model is a chopper as usual but a very well executed one at that. This one really looks the part. It has a clever V-twin engine with Harley-type primary drive and a type of springer fork. It's a shame the frame is rather flimsy.<br><br>Playability is good; both bikes steer well (much better than 8420), both have working engines and a side stand. The main model has front and back suspension (although the front only works if you put something in front of the wheel) and the second model has interesting front suspension.<br><br>I bought the set in an airport in one of the most expensive countries in Europe so I can't say much about value for money. I hope it will retail for about â‚¬40 and at that price it would certainly be worth the money.<br><br>It's got fewer parts than the previous big bike and it's a bit smaller but it wins in every aspect. It's not perfect; the front suspension doesn't work properly, the engine isn't realistic and I would have liked a wider rear tire. Still I'm giving this bike top marks because it's just the best looking Technic bike by a mile and it's got a great second model.<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
"ndelaney","2010-07-19T08:58:23.583Z","Best Technic Motor Bike.","<p>I put together 8051&nbsp;over the weekend and had been looking forward to the build since I saw the set advertised&nbsp;for summer 2010.&nbsp;This set took me about 1 hour to piece together once I dumped all the pieces out and organized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As&nbsp;I expected from pictures on the net the set comes with new tires and wheels. A+ on the new design.&nbsp;These are a bit taller than 8420 and little more narrow than the front tire of 8420. Front suspension again was neccesary and is fairly functional. I would have rather seen a new color or design instead of the old black one we have had for 20 years.</p>
<p>One&nbsp;really cool feature&nbsp;is the new engine design that orientates the engine far different from previous Technic bikes it's only a 3 cylinder but the pistons are longer and the engine looks scale for the bike. Several gears are used to turn the 3 cylinder in between the rear tire and engine and that can make&nbsp;it a little stiff to crank sometimes.</p>
<p>One problem I have with the this bike is the chain. For the second straight bike in a row lego has put a cheap chain and wrong rear gear size on there bikes. I have look at the chain on 8420 and 8430 and it is a better chain link than what comes on both 8051 and 8291. I thinks it's cheap chain link! The other issue is the rear gear size may look closer to scale but it's not functional. They need to put a different size on the rear tire so that the chain fits snug and not so loose.</p>
<p>Overall the bike has great value with all the technic plates,&nbsp;beams, gears and misc..... I would recomend this set to anyone who likes&nbsp;what they see on the box. The alternate chopper bike is not as well constructed though.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Has a 3 cylinder engine, long connecting rods which is strange, new tires and wheels, and in the same scale as the other big bikes which is a plus for where im displaying this one. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I built the chopper 1st, it is a fun build, not challenging, used all the chain and has a duel crank shaft engine. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main model is the most fun I had building since the latest technic front end loader. Took me about an hour to build, has suspension, nice engine, weird oversized connecting rods, new rims, stickers were easy to put on.<br><br>For parts:&nbsp; I would never let this model end up in my parts bin, however there is some parts that are a must for MOCs that can be easily taken off without complete disassembly. <br>Speedometer and tach gauges, tires, front suspension, chain + has a lot of extra chain when your done with the main model and 2 24 tooth gears, and 4 gear racks.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall this was a great buy, great racing bike, very easy to access parts for MOCs.

"Lola","2010-10-11T08:53:37.783Z","A nice addition, plagued by details","<h4>Overall</h4><div><br></div><div>The main model isn't quite as striking when built as the drawing on the box lets you expect. It would be good for kids to play with if the front was done right. This set offer some special/new parts as&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;above. Model 2's chassis is a bit similar to 8291, (Oh, no, not a chopper again...) but then the engine on this one is steampunk-dream, and saves the lot for actual creative use of the long rods.</div><div><br></div><h4>Building</h4><div><br></div><div>Building&nbsp;is OK, with the strange rods already spoken of, but then, thanks LEGO for departing from the usual V or Flat engine, that's not a moment too soon.</div><div>The main build front screams Triumph Street Triple, with dual headlight and in-line transverse liquid-cooled triple engine. Back would be almost MV Agusta with one-exhaust-can-per-cylinder placed under the tail. They should've gone for a mono-arm at the back I think.</div><div>Front wheel is much too close from the radiator to allow suspension travel or real childsplay.</div><div>There's only 2 exhausts coming from the engine, and they come from nowhere around the gearbox, not from the front as should.</div><div>The rear suspension is much too high, it shouldn't start from the mudguard to reach underneath the seat: in real life, the mono shock is set as low as possible.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Parts</h4><div><br></div><div>As revealed above, a few novelties are welcome, even if the long rods aren't new, just a new way to assemble an engine. Wheels are very motorcycle in design, no way you'll build a 1920's Bugatti with them. When you finish the main build, it's astonishing how much of these parts are there just for show, with no or few meaning (and I like it better without them).&nbsp;</div><div>The rounded red 'mudguard' that serves here as a tank top gets the sticker on it at the factory, that is a plain shame.</div><div><br></div><h4>Playability</h4><div><br></div><div>Quite good if you don't push too hard on the front; despite the lag in the chain, the engine runs smoothly, all gears aren't subject to too much force. Lateral stand isn't very natural, tough.</div><div><br></div><h4>Value for money</h4><div>This is a rather small set, so it's better to wait for the price to get down a bit; all the building issues stated are just room for work/improvement, and the model 2, even with an&nbsp;uninteresting&nbsp;chassis, worth it for the delirious Very Big Vee engine. If you are into steampunk, this is the perfect base for a LandSpeedRecord Victorian-style outrageous contraption.</div>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,3
"AndyFawcett","2010-08-06T15:52:54.08Z","My first bike set","<p>This was my first Technic bike set, and I was impressed.</p>
<p>First I built the B model, and I loved the overall look of it. Very very impressed, this could even have been the A model, it's that good. The only slightly weird part was the engine, which was effectively two single-cylinder engines, each with their own crank, geared together. It's not impossible to have an engine like this, but it is a bit strange.</p>
<p>For the A model, it's a fairly standard sportbike from the last 20 years, with a &quot;triple&quot; engine, monoshock rear suspension, front telescopic forks. As others have commented, it's a bit strange to have a triple with 180 degree crank offset, but it's also not unheard of. I remember the original Laverda Jota had such a setup, and it was only later it got a 120 degree crank.</p>
<p>One idiosyncrasy is that the rear wheel is the same as the front. Sorry, but even my moped in the 70s had a wider rear than front :D</p>
<p>Still, love the set, so much that I'll be buying it again so I can have both the A and B built.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4

The front wheel attachment could be better too, and just like the rest of the bike, the front suspension looks better than it works.<br><br>On the two models, the steering is too loose and the chains are a bit clumsy but in general works fine.<br><br>It's worth the money just for the look of the B model, but the A model is not bad too.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

<p>The front wheel however is odd. It should have been smaller in diameter for this kind of bike.</p>
<p>It model scale is roughly 1:6 and could sit beside any other die-cast motorbike models of the same scale.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>Eco-friendly small size box. Instructions are ok.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>New wheels for this set, unfortunatelly exactly the same size front and rear unlike the 8420 set, which had different size tyres front (<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=51378c01"">www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=51378c01</a>) and rear (<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=51378c02"">www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=51378c02</a>).

"SenatorBlutarsky","2011-02-16T11:51:21.263Z","Surprisingly good","<p>I have to preface this review by stating that the race car and motorcycle sets&nbsp;do not usually interest me.&nbsp; I am more often drawn to the sets that feature construction or farm equipment.&nbsp; However, I saw this set at my local Target and the picture on the box looked pretty impressive, so for the very reasonable price of $39.99&nbsp;I thought I'd give it a go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build took me somewhere between an hour and a half and two hours (at a fairly leisurely pace) and went pretty smoothly.&nbsp; The instructions for this model were more intuitive than those for most of the other models I have built.&nbsp; Having not build a motorcycle set before, I liked how the beams connected at weird angles to form the body of the cycle.&nbsp; For a change, I actually got all of the stickers (and there are quite a few of them) postioned in pretty much exactly the right locations.&nbsp; With my big fingers, I usually botch that part of the build somewhat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I don't have any other motorcycle sets to compare this one against, I was pretty impressed with the finished product.&nbsp; It looks great, and it's rock solid.&nbsp; The functions included in this set are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal motorcycle steering via the handlebars. 
<li>Front and rear suspension. 
<li>A working inline 3-cylinder engine that is driven by the rear wheel via a chain. 
<li>A stand that may be raised/lowered.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As others have mentioned, the front suspension is much stiffer than the rear suspension.&nbsp; This difference is due to the fact the the front wheel is attached to the frame via two shock absorbers, while the rear wheel is attached to the frame with only one shock absorber, and that one is working at a mechanical disadvantage at the inside end of the rear fork.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The engine uses new (at least I haven't seen them before) extra-long connecting rods for the pistons.&nbsp; I like this design choice.&nbsp; Because it is difficult to see the pistons moving from the top (the cylinder heads are obscured by the tank), the extra-long rods are the primary visible moving engine part.&nbsp; As other have noted, the chain that drives the engine is quite a bit looser than it should be.&nbsp; However, that appears to be an aesthetic problem only;&nbsp;the chain did not pop off even after I pushed the cycle along the ground at a&nbsp;fairly high speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a parts perspective, this set provides you with pretty good value for your money.&nbsp; You get a small assortment of gears (including, as others have noted, the big 40T gear in the rear), 4 racks (which serve only as decorations&nbsp;in this model),&nbsp;a decent amount of chain links, the parts for a three-cylinder engine (including the nifty extra long rods), three shock absorbers, a few specialized ornamental pieces (such as the brake handles and the tank cover),&nbsp;and a good assortment of body panels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, although this set is not my usual type, I was very impressed with it.&nbsp; I enjoyed the build, the playability is good, and the parts inventory is more than satisfactory for the price.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
"tppytel","2011-03-08T00:25:17.89Z","Great Introductory Technic Set","Previous reviewers have done an admirable job describing the technical details of this set, and their evaluations are spot-on. But since this set's price point and subject puts it nicely in the ""introductory"" category, I think it's worth adding a few comments from someone (like me!) who is neither a motorcycle buff nor a Technic veteran. This was my first Technic set ever, and it was a good enough introduction to prod me into ordering several more in short order.<br><br>The main model took me (a total Technic newbie) about 2-3 hours to complete, taking my time and thinking through how the functions were developing. There are really only two significant functional systems - the engine/transmission and the suspension - but each one builds nicely across most of the model and is enjoyable to see come together. I didn't find any steps especially challenging or tricky provided I was paying attention to the directions. I don't think there's anything here that should trouble a new Technic builder (young or old). The resulting bike looks great, in my non-cycle-buff opinion. It's also very stable and runs smoothly - I have no worries letting my 3 year old drive it around the room. Excellent playability and a great model overall.<br><br>The B model I also found well worth building, though the final model has some flaws. Generally, it's a more straightforward construction than A, largely due to the simpler suspension and engine mounting - this might make it a better first build for someone trying to understand Technic logic. But even if you've built A already, B does include a V-Twin engine instead of A's inline 3, which is a nice opportunity to learn some more Technic basics. The front suspension is also slightly different and interesting to build. However, as others have pointed out, the resulting bike, while possibly better-looking, has some stability and operational issues - the front wheel mounting is rather weak given the sharp angle of the attachment, the body flexes too much, and the chain doesn't quite run smoothly. Overall, the B model was a very worthwhile build, but it's not going to be a keeper unless it's purely for display. If you don't like repeatedly breaking down and reassembling the set, I'd recommend building B first - just use the instructions from A when you cut the tubing and use only the stickers for the red panels (which are identical between models). Build B once, admire it, then build A and you'll understand the build better and end up with a more functional bike to play with. Personally, I'll just use this as an excuse to build A one more time and think more carefully about its design.<br><br>Overall, I'm thrilled with this set as my first Technic experience. It's big enough to implement a couple of functions well, but small enough that I feel I can understand the overall design. By the time I rebuild the A model again, I'll have gotten a good 6+ hours of thoughtful building out of the set. And my kids end up with a solid, sporty motorbike to play with. For $40, this set was a great value, especially compared to what you get for that money in the other Lego lines. I'm looking forward to more Technic sets with enthusiasm.<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

For example, the chain is slightly too loose, and sometimes it will try to ""skip"" a gear tooth. However, to minimize this problem, it is best to reduce friction between the gears as much as possible (ie. give the gear some slack and make sure it is not rubbing against the adjacent beam). Also, the angled 4x6 light grey beams placed over the hoses are pushed outward by them, because the hoses protrude half a stud length too far out. As a result, the beams are bent out of line with what their actual alignment is supposed to be. This is again easily fixed by simply attaching the longer side of the beams into place instead of the shorter side (you will know what I'm talking about if you have this set). Lastly, their are not enough body panels to cover up all the gears and interior of the bike.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall a great set for its price and size, and I would recommend it to any Technic fan.</div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><br></div></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"DrFrankenstein","2012-10-07T00:06:18.037Z","Possibly the best motorcycle model in the history of Technic thus far","<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is it - the ultimate Technic motorcycle to date. This beast of a model sports such impressive, detailed, and realistic looks that it will for sure become a conversation piece for your guests. The build is super fun and makes great use of angled beams construction. The tires feel right for the model. The stickers add a lot to its looks a and just beg to be applied.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Looks like a real sports motorcycle</li><li>Very detailed model (nice stickers too)</li><li>Feels solid<br></li><li>Fun memorable build</li><li>Packs all the functionality one could ask for</li><li>The kick-stand works perfect</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The chain is too loose and keeps catching</li><li>The engine pistons are not visible</li><li>The front fork is stressed too much due to its angle and lack of side support<br></li></ul>
<p> At the end of the day, this model is pure fun to build and have around. Even if you are not a motorcycle buff, this set is a must-have! It does have a few deficiencies (notably the chain catching), but they hardly distract from the great looks of this bike. If the chain problem bothers you, there are a couple workarounds that people have suggested.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

"Wom","2016-01-09T13:21:53.713Z","The motorcycle you want to buy for the B-model","<p>A lot of the reviews you will find are for not for the B-model of this set. And that&nbsp;is a pity to be honest, because the designer(s) of this set made the nicest looking Technic Lego bike with the alternate model if you ask me. So let&#39;s have a look at the chopper b-model, shall we?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""	http://static.tweakers.net/ext/f/0SpWAVocidq1dWlVUvFCptYy/full.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Normally people buy Lego sets for the main model. In some other cases people by sets for certain parts or minifigs they want or need for their own models. But this Technic set you are going to want for the B-model. The main motorcycle is actually already one of the best bikes Lego has released, but the chopper is the coolest two-wheeler I have seen in a Lego set.</p>

<p>If you first want to build the A-model be sure to keep all the spare parts aside. Especially the left-over parts for the chains are needed if you want to build the chopper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions for this model are clear. The hardest parts of the actual build are the chains and some of the connections you make which go through the bike itself. But nothing too complicated to be honest.</p>

<p>This set is looked at as a medium-sized starters set, which would fit the experience I had with the build as well. This is good model if you are fairly new into Technic as you are introduced in some nice features Technic may bring. The cylinders move smoothly and the chains give a good insight on how things work on an actual chopper. To be honest, the B-model runs smoother than the A-model, especially the chain.</p>

<p>Once the build is done you have real cool-looking bike in front of you. Its a low and mean model which has a bit of toughness surrounding it. Just what a bike like this needs. There are two things which&nbsp;could be done differently where possible. The double setup of the chains makes the bike a bit wide and the rear tire should have been at least double the size in thickness. I&#39;ve been looking into this, but there are not a lot of useful tires Lego produced for a fat rear tire.&nbsp;One candidate could be the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8857-1/Street-Chopper"">Street Chopper from 1993</a>, which I actually own. Maybe I will try that one when I feel up to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing I like about this B-model. It&#39;s already the coolest looking motorcycle Lego has made, but it also leaves room for improvement for people who are really into choppers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stickers I applied when I got the bike (2011) are still looking really good. They actually don&#39;t look bad at all of the chopper model, although I could understand people who don&#39;t want to apply any stickers at all. At least the stickers I applied are still very firmly on the plastic, so well done Lego and well done myself (I guess...).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In my experience this is the best Technic set Lego has released with a motorcycle theme. Both models look nice, but I personally would recommend the B-model after having build both of them. It looks a lot more bad-ass and as Lego has not yet released a chopper as a leading model for set it&#39;s a bit more unique I guess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some minor improvements which could be done. But just as real choppers very often are modified as well, you can use this chopper as a template and go from there. Happy building!</p>
