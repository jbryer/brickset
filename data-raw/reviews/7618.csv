I had no choice, I had to buy it...<br><br>No numbered bags for this model, just some bags in various sizes with all the parts. The instructions are divided over two books for no apparent reason. I was disappointed to find that the instructions for the B-model are not included.<br><br>Building the model isn't especially difficult but there are a few steps where young builders may struggle. You start with the front of the chassis, then work your way back to build the mechanism for tipping or unloading. During the build it's not immediately obvious how it works but it's a very clever trick. The lifting and unloading with the motor works well but the 24t gear in the drive train of the Lineair Actuator should have been a clutch gear to prevent a big rattle when the LA reaches the end of its range.<br>There are some strange parts choices. I was happy to see the return of the old non-friction pins for some moving parts but in other places friction pins are used for parts that should move. A 10-long studded Technic beams was also a pleasant surprise (it's used for the lights and number plate at the front).<br><br>It's a nicely detailed model. The cabin doors open, there are seats, mirrors, lights and the new panels give the cab a nice shape. The blue colour makes a nice change from the mostly red or yellow Technic vehicles. Steering is the traditional Hand of God and unfortunately there was no room for a movinig steering wheel in the cab.<br><br>Playability is great with this set, especially if you have the parts to make a second container. The mechanism allows you to collect a full container, tip it somewhere else and deliver it empty again.<br><br>All in all a good looking clever model with a nice parts selection. My only criticism is that the PF motor makes it a bit pricey which makes the lack of instructions for the B-model even more frustrating.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4

<p>The motor is the small one which is a little disappointing cause when you think of a truck it has a big engine so this was a feature that could be better.</p>
<p>The action of the container coming off the back is quite neat but the lever that controls the container tipping up or taking it off is very stiff and requires a bit of&nbsp;effort, i think it could be better designed and i have played around with making it better.</p>
<p>Over all you well have fun building it and playing around with it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4

"joao","2011-02-02T21:14:09.387Z","Dark ages return to LEGO Technic wasn't a good experience","<p>I always knew I'd return from my dark ages and have been collecting classic LEGO for the last year or so. I loved Technic as a kid but hadn't yet committed to trying one out, mostly because none of the sets appealed to me and because of the new no-studs brick.</p><p>I got this one as a gift and it took me two sittings to put it together. The set looks nice once completed but it is a lot of work when compared to a normal studded LEGO. I wouldn't mind if I'd get more than the old wheel-turn mechanism I'd seen when I was a kid and a new screw lift. Almost no gears are present in this set. This set is mostly a display model made of Technic bricks and has very little of mechanic substance which disappointed me.</p><p>Because there isn't much to see in it I took it apart and used the numerous pieces for other things. <br></p><p>I'm sticking with stud LEGO for now, but borrowing the motor for some creations.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,1,1,3

"SenatorBlutarsky","2011-03-14T16:59:20.743Z","Good, but not great","<p>As others have indicated, this set will probably never be enshrined in the Technic Hall of Fame, but it certainly&nbsp;does have its charm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It only took me two and half hours to assemble the A model, including opening the bags and sorting their contents, which is pretty quick for a Technic set with almost 700 parts.&nbsp; The relatively short build time should probably be an indicator that this is not the most complicated build.&nbsp; Indeed, there are really only two mechanisms in the model:&nbsp; the steering linkage and the tipping/lifting mechanism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steering linkage is typical of most Technic models, but the tipping/lifting mechanism is rather unique.&nbsp; It was not obvious to me during the build process that this mechanism would work as advertised -- there is definitely some subtlety there.&nbsp; The linear actuator raises a rail assembly under the container.&nbsp; This rail assembly is jointed in the middle.&nbsp; For the tipping function, the entire rail assembly is raised, and for the lifting function, just the upper half of the rail assembly pivots.&nbsp; The tipping/lifting selection is made via a lever on the side of the truck chassis.&nbsp; In one position, the lever allows the lower rail assembly to move freely; in the other position, it locks the lower half of the&nbsp;rail assembly down.&nbsp; The locking mechanism is where the subtlety lies.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is lever that hangs down from the lower rail assembly.&nbsp; The end of this lever dovetails with another lever assembly that is linked to the selector switch.&nbsp; In one position the the hanging lever is pulled slightly forward, which prevents it from moving upward; in the other position, the hanging lever is pushed slightly backward, which allows it to disengage from the lower chassis lever assembly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The playability of the main model is good, but it could have been better.&nbsp; In addition to the steering and tipping/lifting functions, which all work very well, you can also open the cab doors, and lock/unlock the rear tailgate via a small switch at the rear corner of the container.&nbsp; That's not a bad set of functions, but it would have been nice if there were some other function.&nbsp; Also, the container is very shallow, which means that the tailgate is very short.&nbsp; That, in turn, means that only very small items loaded into the container will actually pass through the tailgate when the container is tipped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The set does include some power functions parts -- a battery box, an M motor, and a linear actuator. 
<li>The lifting function and the switch to convert from tipping to litfing are somewhat unique, and they both work quite well. 
<li>Neat blue-and-grey color scheme.&nbsp; Note, though, that&nbsp;there are probably not nearly as many blue pieces as you might expect, since they are used only for parts of the cab and the rim of the container.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Playability could have been improved by including another function or two -- perhaps&nbsp;a V6 engine or some kind of&nbsp;suspension for the rear axles. 
<li>Some of the details are little goofy looking, like the&nbsp;tailgate lock that other have mentioned.&nbsp; The container looks too shallow as well -- but at least that can be easily fixed by adding a few more rows of beams to the sides. 
<li>As others have mentioned, the linear actuator grinds badly at&nbsp;its extreme ranges.&nbsp; The really annying thing about this problem is that it could easily have been remedied by including a clutch gear in place of the 24T regular gear that sits on the axle that drives the linear actuator. 
<li>There are only 4 gears included (6 if you include the 2 yellow knobs in the steering linkage).</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I definitely liked some of the features of this set, including the tipping/lifting mechanism and the blue Technic pieces, but there are also many areas in which it could have been improved.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I&nbsp;give it a thumbs up, especially if you are interested getting in the power functions parts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There appears to be a trend to include power functions more and more in the Technic sets.&nbsp; While I like the power functions, I'm not so sure whether I like this trend.&nbsp; If I continue to acquire sets like this, I am going to end up with a pile of battery boxes that I'll never use.&nbsp; I almost like the approach taken in sets like the 8053 mobile crane and the 8265 loader better -- don't include power functions parts, but do include instructions for adding power functions parts to the model.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"Davian","2011-02-28T15:10:40.617Z","Solid set for Technic Newbies- EXCELLENT parts set for the serious builder.","<p>I found this set at&nbsp;a local liquidator for $32.78 + tax.&nbsp; I had&nbsp;seen it in TRU and thought it looked decent and&nbsp;so I could not pass up the chance to have another motor, battery box, and more than 675 other pieces for $35.</p>
<p>While the set&nbsp;does not offer anything groundbreaking in terms of complex function, the&nbsp;construction&nbsp;o the A model&nbsp;offers ideas on&nbsp;building strong frames (particularly for&nbsp;vehicles) and the set provides a great assortment of parts for future creations.&nbsp; Even the so-called&nbsp;""custom"" panels can be used in countless other projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;completed A model vehicle is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good looking and sturdy&nbsp;truck.&nbsp; The cab is very nicely designed (as most of the&nbsp;current&nbsp;LEGO truck cabs are) with the placement of the battery box well integrated&nbsp;while still&nbsp;easily&nbsp;accessible for battery removal/replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;with many of the new power functions Technic sets there is no transmission- the included gears operate the functions- in this case tilting or sitting down the container.&nbsp; Steering is HOG, and the wheels are simply free-roll-there is no&nbsp;engine and no suspension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The genius in this design is simple but there- the&nbsp;mechanism which allows the&nbsp;single actuator to either tilt the container (and dump&nbsp;its&nbsp;contents) or set the container on the&nbsp;ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not build the B model (you must access the instructions online) and probably never will- I already see a lot of uses for the parts from this set.&nbsp; However, there are a lot of tweaks that can be made to the A model.&nbsp; I&nbsp;moved the seats a length in order to allow the&nbsp;truck to be ""driven"" by a Technic&nbsp;Model Team figure.&nbsp; I also added mud flaps behind the rear tires, steps to help workers enter the cab, a fuel tank, and made the container larger and&nbsp;enclosed it.&nbsp; Now the truck is one of those&nbsp;portable storage delivery vehicles-LOL.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truck chassis itself offers many possibilities- simply remove the container and actuator and create.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall a decent set, and&nbsp;for the parts worth the price.&nbsp; Find on sale and its a steal.&nbsp;LEGO fans who are new to Technic should really enjoy the build; long time Technic fans should appreciate the&nbsp;parts.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,5,3,5,4
"Ninjapineapple","2015-11-07T10:32:46.507Z","Awesome, from a biased perspective","<p>firstly, I must put that due to my strong sentimental&nbsp;attachment with this set, I refuse that there could be anything wrong with the set. It has a nice blue, grey and black colour scheme, which gives it a clean, neat look. The unloading/tipping mechanism is great, and both functions work without a hitch.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

"Ferrari0806","2021-02-01T09:32:49.51Z","One of the best display sets","<p>I got this set of a friend. It was never built and mostly sealed. Some of the best features of the set is how power functions can bring the container up and down. I would recommend this set to an experienced builder as parts of this&nbsp;set can be quite tricky to build. However, once built it is a stunning set. I don&rsquo;t usually play with my sets but watching the beam going up and down is quite fun. Some flaws with this set is that it has a lot of stickers and a lot of empty space that could have been used for more detail. Over all this is one of my favourite sets I own and makes a great display on a shelf.</p>
