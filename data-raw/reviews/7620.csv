"Cygnyx","2010-06-10T23:10:57.967Z","Into The Sky","<p>Hmm, first review. While at the local (if you can call an half-hour drive local...) TRU, I was lucky enough to pick up the last set. At the time of writing, I've only built the jet &amp; propeller plane, but will rebuild into the boat to see how it looks in the near future... Maybe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall - The completed jet is, well, huge.&nbsp; At about 40cm long &amp; with a 33cm wingspan, it takes up quite a bit of space, but it looks really nice. Even as it's just sitting there (mayhap it's parked on a tarmac?) the jet looks impressive. The propeller plane is a little smaller, but just as cool-looking (though that may be because I think it looks like a de Havilland Mosquito...)</li>
<li>Bulding Experience - Honestly, probably the best 50 minutes I've spent building a Creator kit, though a bit of time was spent being occupied with playing with the landing gear &amp; the 'magic switch'&nbsp;(more on that later...) Bulding the jet was quite enjoyable, especially seeing as how all the sections came together. </li>
<li>Parts -&nbsp;Plenty to be used for MOCs. With different kinds&nbsp;of red arches &amp; slopes,&nbsp;a pair of white mudguards, quite a bunch of Technic bits &amp; pieces, and a good amount of wing pieces. And, of course,&nbsp;two light bricks. Sweet.</li>
<li>Playability - Where do I start? While it looks cool just sitting there, who wouldn't like to take the jet out for a Mach 3 joyride?&nbsp;The best part, however, is that black 'magic switch' sitting in the fuselage. Push it forward, and it activates a lever that opens up the back part of the cockpit. Push it the other way, however, and it activates the light bricks, which in turn make the engines light up. The landing gear is tucked away nice &amp; safe in the belly of the jet, and can be quickly swung out &amp; locked into place for landings. The propeller plane, while with less features, is still cool, with a reverse-tricycle landing gear configuration. This time, the 'magic switch' is pressed to light up both bricks, tucked underneath the wings, next to the engines. This further adds to it being the Mosquito's brother, as one can imagine the bricks to be machine guns.</li>
<li>Value For Money - In my opinion, worth it.</li></ul>
<p>Best regards, Cyg</p>

"Paul007","2010-09-18T09:34:42.557Z","Great appearance, Playability","<p>After waiting a long time for this set, I was finally able to purchase it at the local Lego Store (which was out of the set in stock), and they mailed it to me with no shipping charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Building Experience</h4>
<p>The building experience for each of the three kits is interesting and stimulating for the most part, with the exception for the dull speedboat.&nbsp; It is great to see the prop plane and the jet come together piece by piece, with repetition only in the wings of the planes and the engines of the prop plane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts included are of a wide variety and are of very high quality.&nbsp; Many cheese slopes are included, two cockpit pieces of course as well as two large engine pieces, many flat pieces all around including triangular wing pieces.&nbsp; Two light bricks are included, and a few technique pieces and clips are included to make the frame for the landing gear and support moving parts.&nbsp; The density of the colors from greatest to least is Red, White, Black, Dark Grey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<ul>
<li>The playability for this set is tremendous.&nbsp; The smallest kit, the speedboat, is a bit dissappointing, as it is much to big for minifigure scale,&nbsp; but is still a bit sharp looking.</li>
<li>The prop plane is a great kit to swoosh, the propellers are of course spinable, and a switch on the top lights up the light bricks beneath each wing, which direct light through a 2x1 Technique hole brick, creating the appearance of firing heavy cannons.&nbsp; The Landing gear on the prop plane is functional yet a bit weird; a small wheel (realisticly) is the rear support and is stationary, and the main set of gear is swivelled down from the engine construction, giving the set a wide wheel base.&nbsp;&nbsp; However the forward landing gear seem much too long when the kit is sitting on its wheels, as the nose of the plane is pointing at a high angle up into the air.&nbsp; This kit overall is supreme and gives the appearance of a WWII era Allied medium bomber.</li>
<li>The Jet Fighter is of course the star kit of this set, and also obviously the largest.&nbsp; Easy and fun to swoosh, the set also sits on the tarmac of it's airfield well, with a modern three point landing gear set which locks into position.&nbsp; The kit has great moving control surfaces; moving parts on the main wing, fully moving horizontal stabilizers, and moving canards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the three sets of wings comes of with little effort, attached to the body by pins, and thus the appearance of the jet can be quickly changed, an interesting feature.&nbsp; The kit has a switch on the top similar to the prop plane, but operating two ways; when pushed forward, it opens the rear canopy of the cockpit, and when pushed backward, it triggers the two light bricks which serve as afterburners for the engines.&nbsp; The cockpit perfectly fits two minifigures sporting crash helmets.&nbsp; Plenty of weapons can be attached underneath the delta wings, and the kit overall has a very sleek, fast, and agile appearance.&nbsp; It much reminds me of the fifth Generation European Fighters, such as the Eurofighter. </li></ul>
<h4>Value for Money</h4>
<p>$60 USD is not too much to ask for 539 pieces, but one can only wonder how much it would have cost if released five years ago...perhaps only $50 USD.&nbsp; The steeper price is just something we have to deal with now due to raised petrolium cost and poor economy, but it is not outrageous for this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>This set is definately a must-buy for aviation enthusiasts, with top notch construction and great pieces that can be used in MOC's.&nbsp; The prop plane or the Jet will both make a suitable impression to people from a shelf, or entertain a KFOL for hours.&nbsp; really a supreme set, with no cons except the slightly dissappointing speedboat.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"BigMac","2011-04-09T22:21:38.917Z","The best Sonic Jet from Lego, but the price has to be reduced to half for clearance.","I get this yesterday at about half of the original price from a local department store. The reasons I bought this are, firstly the price is really cheap compare with those Star Wars models, and secondly all three reviewers before me gave this as a 5 star set. After I finished the building of this Sonic Boom, I have to thank the previous reviewers of the set, because the set is great!!. Without their comments, I may have missed this one, thank you.<div><br></div><div>Back to the set, I would like to review this by a pros/ cons list.</div><div><br></div><div>PROS.</div><div><br></div><div>1. Scale and Mini Fig compatibility:&nbsp;</div><div>Most creator sets are with different scale, hard to put the mini figs into the model. I put two astronauts from the Mars Mission in the cockpit, they fit in perfectly. For a 1:40 scale ( Approx. scale of the mini fig) the Sonic boom is about 16 meter long, with a wing span of 14 meter, could be a bit bigger, but should be still in a reasonable scale.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Aesthetic and Colour Scheme:</div><div>The red and white colour is a very attractive combination, personally, I would like to have a bit more of white. Aesthetically, it is an unbeatable Lego model. The led lights (fire from the jest engine) at the back looks great, especially in the dark, it is very bright. The air inhale drums at the sides of the cockpit is a perfect design enhances the appearance of the model to a great extent. The big triangular wings match with those of a real jet sonic.</div><div><br></div><div>3. Functions/ playability:</div><div>The openable cockpit, the retractable landing gear, the ""red hot fire"" from the jet engine and the adjustable flappers/minor wings render the set to a very playable model.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>4. Parts and Model:</div><div>539 parts and three different models for only AUD $47.00, it is a good bargain. I have not build the other two models, apparently, should not be as great as the main model, but bearing in mind that these two second model comes with colour printed instructions are just bonus to the set.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Cons</div><div><br></div><div>1. Only the rear cover to the cockpit is openable, the front one is fixed.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>2. There is no fixed switch to the led lights, you have to press the key all the time otherwise the lights will off.</div><div><br></div><div>My additions:</div><div><br></div><div>I did not modify or put addition to the set. I just fixed this on a stand. The stand is from 10186 Star War General Grievous. which is black, sturdy build, heavy and turnable, a very good stand for displaying of Lego models. To me, the stand is the best part of 10186.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall I give this a 4.5 and round up to 5, very worth to have it at such a price.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading.</div><div><br></div><div>Brickmad.</div><div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"That_LDD_Guy","2011-01-03T13:34:59.063Z","Airplane Starter set","<h4>This is a Great set!</h4>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is nice and big, and the instructions are fairly clear, printed in three books, one for each model, clear enough to earn a 4/5.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Lots of them! This is a box of pure airplane parts, and after you build any of these models the box still rattles with parts. If you are starting a collection or an airplane fan this is a must buy.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>None, but the cockpits fit them really nicely.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build was moderatly difficult, with limited repetitvness.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Beautiful, all three of&nbsp;them, and since they are creator sets, they can be very easily modded.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Incredible, one of the best sets I have ever had the pleasure of owning.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"murrayhenson","2012-05-27T16:46:54.103Z","Strap yourself in and feel the G's","<p>
	I guess I&#39;m just a big kid because as soon as I saw this I knew I wanted it. &nbsp;I knew, at some point, that I&#39;d end up making silly jet noises and doing fly-overs of the cats. &nbsp;In short, long before I had it or built it I knew that I&#39;d love it because, quite simply, it&#39;s a big red and white jet.</p>
<h4>
	Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>
	The box is pretty big but perhaps only half of it is air unlike some SW sets where it is sometimes three quarters air. &nbsp;The box itself is pretty solid; I had mine shipped from Germany and it arrived with just one corner slightly dented. &nbsp;The instructions, as usual, were fine - methodical as always.</p>
<h4>
	Parts</h4>
<p>
	Since this is a Creator set and it includes two propellers I would say that the parts are quite flexible. &nbsp;I love the little light bricks. &nbsp;I would imagine that the may be somewhat difficult or fiddly to use in a MOC ...if they could be incorporated and used it would be a big bonus. &nbsp;The only thing I didn&#39;t like, part-wise, was the particular wheels that were used (knobbly vs. smooth). &nbsp;I&#39;m guessing this was a compromise but it does seem a tiny bit odd. &nbsp;Still, the wheels retract so it&#39;s not as if you have to look at them all the time.</p>
<h4>
	Minifigures</h4>
<p>
	El Zilcho. &nbsp;In the photos I&#39;ve added a guy from the Discovery Shuttle set to act as the pilot.</p>
<h4>
	The build</h4>
<p>
	For me, this was a fairly lengthy build. &nbsp;As with almost all Lego sets I buy, I took my time but enjoyed it. &nbsp;Nothing, except for the wings, felt really&nbsp;repetitious. &nbsp;I enjoyed seeing the technique used to do the landing gear (since I&#39;ve only recently gotten back into Lego, lots of things are new to me). &nbsp;As with the Shuttle, incorporating Technics pieces into a large and somewhat complex model like this seems to be a good idea that works well. &nbsp;Same goes for the technique to activate the light bricks, although I did find that process a tiny bit fiddly - it took a bit to get everything positioned *just so*. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	The completed model</h4>
<p>
	This is, I guess, what the US calls a &quot;fourth-generation fighter jet&quot;. &nbsp;It&#39;s a mix of stuff - cropped delta wings with tailplane and control canards. &nbsp;It&#39;s definitely not a Saab Gripen, a Eurofighter Typhoon,&nbsp;Dassault Rafale, or anything else. &nbsp;It is, well, a mix of stuff. &nbsp;The end product looks pretty good, even if I don&#39;t think it is normal for control canards to be positioned forward/in-line of air intakes.</p>
<p>
	The above is all interesting (to some (perhaps)) to me since, as with all good models, the idea is to learn a bit. &nbsp;And so I have, since I did not know what a canard was before I started, nor many other things. &nbsp;Obviously Wikipedia has been the source of information but building the model prompted it and I like opportunities to learn a bit.</p>
<p>
	The color scheme plus the fact that this is a two-seater would seem to be an indication to me that even if this is a military aircraft it is clearly for training or demonstration purposes. &nbsp;I suppose that&#39;s just enough to keep this in line with Lego&#39;s &quot;no weapons&quot; policy although I don&#39;t suppose it would be terribly difficult to add some hardpoints and the associated hardware.</p>
<h4>
	Summary</h4>
<p>
	I&#39;m 34, married, and am in a management role with the firm I&#39;m employed with. &nbsp;After finishing this model, I used it to do several low passes, complete with foolish jet noises, of our cats who were a combination of curious and scared although it wasn&#39;t clear if the jet or my bizzarre behavior was the cause of their fright (which was not long-lived). &nbsp;If that isn&#39;t an indictment of the playability, the fun, the excitement of this model, I don&#39;t know what is. &nbsp;I should also note that I love the look of the jet so much that I suspect it will be a VERY long time before I take it apart and build one of the other models. &nbsp;Just look at it!</p>

"Tie_defender","2020-04-14T09:58:09.087Z","Cool plane with good functions, but common pieces","<p>This is a review of the lego creator sonic boom, first i will go through the pros and cons:</p>

<h2>Pros:</h2>

<p>Looks pretty realistic and good</p>

<p>Is pretty big for the money</p>

<p>In my opinion a good colour scheme&nbsp;</p>

<p>The engines light up and the cockpit opens with the slide of a switch</p>

<p>The switch is not very distracting (In my opinion) and is not going to slide unless you do it yourself</p>

<p>The wheels fold in to the fuselage, unlike most lego city planes.</p>

<p>Moving rudders</p>

<h2>Cons:</h2>

<p>The way the engines light up is not the best, as it sometimes does not hit the light bricks</p>

<p>Very common pieces</p>

<p>No minifigures, it could have been nice if it would have pilots for the plane.</p>

<p>The front stabilisers would block the air intake in real life (yes i know you can just remove them) so it takes away a little from the realism.</p>

<p>The nose sometimes fall of, this might pe a problem only on my copy, but still very annoying</p>

<p>The front windshield doesn&#39;t open, i know it would be hard to fix, but it would have been nice</p>

<h2>Summary:</h2>

<p>Overall a great set for play and display, with many cool features and good looks. However it has its flaws with some functions and on some problems with appearance, but i would recommend this set if you can find it cheap.</p>
