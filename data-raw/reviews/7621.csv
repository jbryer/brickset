"Momomax1234","2010-08-19T05:50:10.767Z","Great Set","<p>This set is amazing. I bought it a few weeks ago in Germany, and I really glad that I bought it. I build the offroader, and here are my coments:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pros</p>
<p>nice designed interior and exterior</p>
<p>huge wheels</p>
<p>a powerful winch</p>
<p>offroader's engine, doors and tailgate really open </p>
<p>steering on both offroader and quad bike</p>
<p>workins suspension</p>
<p>offroader measures 10"" (25cm) long Quad bike measures 4"" (10cm) long</p>
<p>silver elements!</p>
<p>it's a creator set, so you can build three models: truck with digger, dune buggy, and the offroader</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cons</p>
<p>I have nothing to say</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is perfect for any experienced lego builders.</p>

It is an amazing value at $85 and absolutely stunning when assembled. The main build truck has full (simulated in the front) suspension and steering as well as a spacious internal section, including an open bed, the trailer is sturdier than you can imagine, and the quad is simply perfect.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AddictedToStyrene","2010-12-13T00:59:26.067Z","Minor flaws but cute and functional","This set makes a cute, medium sized four wheel drive truck and trailer, with a very good 'quad bike' to go with it. It has a couple of very minor issues in construction, but makes a fun set to display or play with. I have only built the main models, not the alternatives. It comes with four instruction books: two for the main models, and one each for the truck and dune buggy. There are no stickers, and there is a length of string for the tow cable.<br>&nbsp;<br>The four wheel drive is a lot smaller than the old yellow 4404 Land Busters truck from 2003. It is also smaller in scale than the 4993 Cool Convertible from 2008. However, the new truck and trailer does look good next to those models, since they are all large, detailed Lego constructions. <br>&nbsp;<br>The best things about this set are the functions:<br>&nbsp;<br>- The truck has&nbsp;working steering (although mine seems to turn the wheels the wrong way for some reason - have I made a mistake?), spring suspension, opening doors, bonnet (hood for the Americans)&nbsp;and tailgate.<br>&nbsp;<div>[Edit: It turns out I built it wrong. My fault, but a possible trap for the younger builders too!]</div><div><br><div>- The truck also has a working winch. This is on a clockwork Functions block. After you pull out the hook on the winch, you push the front bullbar in to retract the 'cable'. Then lift the bonnet and move a switch to reset the mechanism. If you don't reset it, the cable reels in automatically when you pull the string. <br>&nbsp;<br>- The trailer has folding ramps and a folding dolly wheel. The quad bike has tilt steering and makes novel use of slope parts as fairings and mudguards. <br>&nbsp;<br>When you are building the car, you use white lego beams for stability. These come off at a late stage, and are then used to build the trailer. That means you should build the trailer after the truck.<br>&nbsp;<br>I have only two main problems with this set: <br>&nbsp;<br>- because the Functions brick is asymmetrical, it is not easy to build the four wheel drive truck as a mirror image, to make it right hand drive (which I do with my Lego vehicles.) <br>&nbsp;<br>- the chassis is based on two 6 x 8 technic rectangle blocks, which makes the whole thing bend slightly. This means that the entire structure of the vehicle is a little weak, so be careful when assembling, to stop pieces flying off. Smaller children may need some help here. <br>&nbsp;<br>Despite those shortcomings, I still rate this set highly. It is cute, detailed and functional.<br>&nbsp;</div></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"modena","2010-12-26T12:17:37.41Z","Everything is just great!","I got this set for Christmas, so I can give a detailed review!<h4>Set analysis:</h4><div><b>The build:</b></div><p>It took 3 hours approximately to build this model.&nbsp;It was very hard at first, finding the right brick in the right pile. After a while it went better. The quad-bike for example, took 25 minutes! You also get these white long bricks. At first they are used to hold up the chassis while you build the car. Then, you will have to use them for the trailer.</p><div><b>The parts:</b></div><p>The parts are purely fantastic. From the gears to the bricks, and more, I can easily say that everything is fantastic and functional. It also includes many new and rare bricks that I have never seen before. Than of course, it has the winch brick!</p><div><b>The playability:</b></div><p>Very good. You can drive, winch, race, rebuild, and much more. One distracting thing is that the winch can't go out as far as the string permits it. It stops after a while, and when I continue pulling it cranks. Then it won't wind up properly. Anyway, it is great to play with!</p><div><b>Value for money:</b></div><p>I would say it has a very great value. In all the categories of this review, it scores really well.</p><div>Here are the Pros and Cons:</div><h4>Pros:</h4><div><ul><li>Very good colours!</li><li>Fantastic functions!</li><li>Challenging build!</li><li>Magnificent parts!</li><li>Lots of playability!</li><li>Lots and lots of parts!</li><li>Main model includes a great quad-bike!</li><li>The winch has a lock to keep itself winching in! (The red&nbsp;switch.)</li><li>Lots of lights!</li><li>Lots of opening details and hatches!</li><li>Fantastic and realistic engine!</li><li>Full working suspension at the back!</li><li>Front wheels can steer and twist!</li><li>Trailer can be left alone standing (thanks to an extra wheel)&nbsp;</li></ul></div><h4>Cons:</h4><div><ul><li>Winch cannot extend all the way out.</li><li>Not a very great interior (because of the winch brick) but not bad either.</li><li>You need to untie the hook from the string if you want to rebuild.</li><li>The car doesn't make a full steer, it needs a lot of space to steer.</li></ul></div><h4>Overall:</h4><p>This was such a fantastic set. Comparing it to the 4404, the 4404 may be much bigger, but this model beats it with its cons. Anyway, the 4404 has no steering, and the wheels fall off easily. The 4404 may have a much more detailed interior, but it still doesn't make this set a flaw!</p><p>I don't think I need to tell more. I'll just end by saying that you should immediately go and buy it. REALLY recommended!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"HarlockBrick","2011-06-23T09:18:05.19Z","A set worth the money","<p>The Creator sets are always good value for the parts/money and this set is no exception.</p><p><br></p><p><b>The first thing that impressed me is that the finished vehicle is alot bigger then any picture couldnt rappresent.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Its a big colorful piece of modern Lego display.</p><p>The set has no real negative points, just minor things.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Main vehicles design and color</li><li>Off-road jeep is way bigger then it looks on pictures</li><li>no stickers</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Interior could be a bit more accurate</li><li>Steering wheel falls off too easily</li></ul>
<p>As of june 2011 the set is easy to get for a good price so grab it before it skyrockets like some older Creator sets.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
