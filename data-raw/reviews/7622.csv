<p>That it's a scorpion rocks. The claws are fairly articulate and can be moved around with ease. Good color scheme of black and orange. It's also a good design over all. My initial impression was to complain about the legs in that they're not mobile enough and if the tail isn't curled just right, it falls over. The more I look at the model though, the more I see that the legs are designed so that the scorpion has a bit of a crouching effect to strike&nbsp;a target with it's tail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm just not sure if $19.99 is really a good price on it. It feels it should have been closer to the $14.99 range of toys for all it's size. In the end, I think if LEGO keeps up good models like this, more and more of the Lego Style critters will grow on me.<br/></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

"xccj","2011-03-10T00:08:55.723Z","The Scorpion in the Deep","<p>I grabbed this set impulsively when I found a good deal at the store.&nbsp; It was only afterwards that I really started to appreciate how good it was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>--Amazing, very detailed scorpion, from the body and legs to the claws to the jaws to the tail.&nbsp; They went out of their way to make this bad boy cool.</p>
<p>-- Awesome selection of parts in black and orange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>-- Minifigure and jet: I understand they had to be small to allow so much detail to be put into the scorpion, but the diver&nbsp;seems way out of his league in this undersea battle.&nbsp; Plus, in general I don't like the lime / gray design of the diver figs.</p>
<p>-- As cool as the tail is, the ""action feature"" given to it is a little weak.&nbsp; It should have all been hinges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of all the Atlantis sets I bought in 2010, this was certainly my favorite.&nbsp; A great creature design, and a decent price.&nbsp; What more could you ask for?</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
"Sobel","2020-05-13T17:36:23.343Z","Deep Sea Danger at its best!","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
This large sea creature manages to impress simply by its size alone. Additionally, it has quite some functions and an odd, but convincing design. It was the first of all the buildable critters that I bought and it should be obvious, why.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The model makes good use of TECHNIC parts for the main structure and the legs. There are a LOT of joints for the tail and the claws which can also be put to good use in MOCs. An abundance of fangs in black and white and some interesting ball joints contribute to the variability of this set. The rubber-pointed stings where also something completely new. Seven stickers have to be applied, but they are not too difficult. Also included is a green atlantean disc with stingray motive.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, this set has only one minifigure, which I personally found a little cheap. It is a diver with greenish gear two-sided head and two harpoons, which are mainly armament for the small scooter.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this creature is more like building a TECHNIC set, than a LEGO System one. There is a lot of Cross-Axle-linking, Connector-clicking and Cross-hole-filling. The only steps that are mainly &quot;basic&quot; parts are the tail (not really basic with all the &quot;joints&quot;) and the claws.&nbsp;<br />
So, the build is not that difficult for an adult, but a kid might require some guidance.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The scorpion stands at some 22cm in length and19cm in width and heigth.The huge claws can be moved in almost any direction via the two ball joints in each arm. The head is fixed, but the jaws can all open individually. When balanced by its tail, the creature stands on all his six legs, yet a little shaky. It tends to tilt forward due to the massive pincers. Therefore, the tail must be kept in a very upright position to secure the balance. It can also be put in various positions with the many clicking joints. For a fast strike, it can simply be pushed slightly, then it falls forward. The reach is limited, since, even with max extension, it only reaches a few centimetres across the head.<br />
The small scooter has no real functions other than to hold the diver and the disc. It has some kind of thruster in the back, fins, a small spotlight in the front and a small claw arm to hold treasure.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is yet another buildable creature which made my critical point towards those models tumble. Though mainly consisting of TECHNIC parts and therefore looking a little odd here and there, it comes out quite impressive and looks like a REAL threat to every deep sea adventurer. The fact, that it is a SCORPION (desert creature) that lives in the deep sea does not subtract from the power and danger that this thing radiates. The massive claws can surely crush a small sub/scooter in one grip and damn, look at these jaws!! The gigantic dual spikes at the end of the long and flexible tail are sure to pierce every submarine&#39;s armor (but not the skin&nbsp;of any careless infant, since they are made of rubber).<br />
This monster is so impressive, it makes the small scooter look completely lost against it. At least, this set HAS some additional stuff, not only a lonesome diver all by himself. The scooter looks good and since the massive creature might not be too fast, the adventure could have a chance of outspeeding it.<br />
One major flaw to this set is the short range of the tail-spikes which make the scorpion&#39;s main weapon quite useless. Also, the balance might be an issue, since the model needs a special positioning of the tail to keep its balance. Furthermore, a little more movement to the head would have been nice, as well as the inclusion of a second minifigure.<br />
But still, this impressive deep sea scorpion is sure to stir up a lot of trouble in the ranks of the bold explorers and parents who like their children&#39;s rooms tidied up!</p>
