Nothing too complicated in building techniques. Parts wise I needed this set to get the 5th and final turtle key. The little runabout on the platform it a little small for my liking, but it makes a great spot for the 8057 Wreck Raider to call home. The platform does have a little crane, overall the platform is just more of display stand. The sub itself has lots of openings and windows galore, which for me ups the playability factor.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4

<div>I got this set to use the Toy R Us sale. I thought it was not a great investment at first but when i started to build it I knew I was wrong. The build is not complex but fun. The build uses a base to put the sub/HQ on. The base has a kitchen and treasure hunting room.&nbsp;</div>

This set is a Swimmer... and a Winner.","<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"">I had collected all of the Aquanauts, AquaSharks, Hydronauts, Stingrays and AguaRaiders back in the day; so I was somewhat interested in the Atlantis sets when they first surfaced (or submerged?&nbsp; Heh) -- I was then completely won over during this second wave of releases with the 'transforming' sets; I'm a sucker for transitioning sets or small vehicles hidden within larger ones (Undersea Explorer 8080 and Neptune Carrier 8075 -- excellent sets).&nbsp; These builds and designs are extremely well crafted and cool.&nbsp; I don't mind so much all of the red bricks; as long as there's the inclusion of the grey, black and green pieces here and there.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"">If there's one thing I look forward to with building LEGO sets, is that after studying the box for every detail, there's usually something still left as a surprise once building the set that was not seen or could not be identified from the packaging or ads; and although this box presentation left little to almost nothing to the imagination, I was still pleasantly surprised to find the sides of the sub fold down for better view and ""play"" inside the sub.&nbsp; The set just has a very nice, rugged and sharp appeal to it.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"">I figure roughly, that 100 bricks equal $10; so at almost 500 pieces, the sub is not overly inflated at $50; Plus, I was able to get the set alongside the Neptune Carrier off of ToyRUs.com during there BOGO half price sale with free shipping; that helped out decreasing the prices of both sets greatly.&nbsp; Sometimes it's a good idea to wait around for a good sale/deal... but some sets are limited, so it's wise not to wait too long.&nbsp; I felt that the lower number of stickers was a great relief for this set; lately, there are just too many.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"">It seems that ever since the Star Wars sets were released way back when, LEGO has taken a great shift in offering sets with a greater number of smaller pieces and much more playability and detail (remember old Castle sets with just the empty castle and 6 knights?).&nbsp; With just the inclusion of a coffee mug, fish, computers, map, detector, et cetera, these newer sets have much more playability than even the older submarine/explorer type sets of yesteryears.&nbsp; Which is a huge bonus.&nbsp; Overall, just an extremely creative and wonderful set.</SPAN></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"AETerry","2011-01-19T20:07:14.657Z","Atlantis Exploration HQ Review","<p>This set works out great and perfectly for providing the Atlantean Divers a mobile or stationary base of operations while they explore the deep ocean for Atlantis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I saw on the box that it transformed, I was a bit skeptical at first on how that would be. Is the gimmick of transforming Legos going to be worth it. Always good to be pleasantly surprised by Lego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At $50, I think a set like this could have had one more minifigure in it. But I'm also remembering a time when a large set like this would have had rather sparse details and a lot of minifigures. So there's an honest trade off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, we have the infernal stickers to deal with for the Atlantis series. Then there's stellar interior details such as computer terminals for the Divers to work at, coffee mug, fish. All that allows for reenacting scenes from the Atlantean movie&nbsp;on Lego's website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's also a mini-crane and areas that suggest the ""dive hole"" for when Divers are bringing in equipment or moving it out. The platform that the folded out sub rests on had me thinking of the platform for oil rigs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Exploration HQ also folds up solidly into a sub and is well built so as not to be flimsy as I feared it might have been at first. So after you get done with the build, you realize it was well worth your $50. I know in this current economy many are looking for the sales and are probably older collectors who remember prices from the 80's before inflation has set in. For many sets, the increased price from inflation has been comparable and appropriate. Other times it does seem too high a price.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Sobel","2020-05-25T21:29:27.557Z","It's a base! It's a ship! It's a transformer!! It is a nice all-round set!","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
Now we&#39;ve reached the large sets of this series. This is the HQ of the underwater explorers which also serves as a large exploration sub. This &quot;transformation-mode&quot; really caught my attention, because I was always fascinated by toys with such functions. So here we go...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Apart from some medium baseplates, lots of TECHNIC bricks for the internal structure and all kinds of&nbsp;red parts for the corporate design, this set features some interesting parts. We have some transparent domes which serve as port-holes and cockpit window, several computers, a map, a lattice tower and two pipes which may all come to good use in MOCs! Also included is an atlantean disc in yellow with a turtle motive. The set has 10 stickers, which is OK for a set this size.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are three minifigures included, which I personally think is cheap. A base-like set should have at least four minifigures, especially, when they are divided in different fractions, like here. We have two male divers, both with &quot;Janus-head&quot; and greenish gear. The third minifigure is a stingray-like guardian with a trident. The explorers have some gear, including flippers, a mug, some kind of detector-device and a fish. There are also several harpoons, but these are mounted on launchers on the station itself.&nbsp;<br />
An additional explorer, preferably a female one, would have been a nice addition, so that at least two crewmen could stay with the base, while one rode the small scooter...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The construction starts with the supporting structure of the base and the small scooter. Very easy. The pillars, that hold the HQ are internally reinforced with a cross axle, so they become very sturdy.<br />
The base/ship itself starts with the two identical floor pieces, which are then linked via the front and some hinges. The outer structure is added from bottom to top, while being constantly supported with TECHNIC parts for a greater stability. The finish is a little fiddly and requires a little more attention when the &quot;roof&quot;-parts with the large stickers and the &quot;tail-fins&quot; are put together with the rest.<br />
All in all, the build is not too complicated, yet, at some stages, might require a little more thoroughness.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished set has two modes: ship and base. In &quot;base-bode&quot;, it rests on the three supporting pillars of the ground structure, as seen in the main picture on this site. This structure also has a small cargo area with a crane and control lever&nbsp;and a tower with a landing platform for the small scooter. The scooter has two steering fins, spear-like harpoons, an oxygen tank and a handle for the pilot. Unfortunately, it has no propulsion device what so ever...<br />
The base opens up in a 90&deg; angle for good access, like a dollhouse. Viewed from behind, the left &quot;wing&quot; holds a spinning chair and a table with a keyboard and two small gas or liquid tanks. The fish is also stored on that table, so maybe it&#39;s some kind of canteen or food processing unit. The right &quot;wing&quot; holds the science-center of the base with computer monitors, a map and some gear. The two &quot;wings&quot; are linked via the cockpit part with the drivers&#39; seat and two levers. Above the middle section sits the foldaway flood-lighting tower with four individually moveable spotlights.<br />
When switching to &quot;mobile-mode&quot;, the tower is folded&nbsp;horizontally with all spotlights pointing to the back. Next, the two &quot;wings&quot; are linked to each other via the single grey TECHNIC pin at the base of the ship. So the former tower now forms the roof of the ship, the large &quot;fins&quot; point backward with the massive turbines underneath. Two dual harpoon-launchers pointing forward and two flip-torpedoes in the back are the ships defensive systems.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Just like the set before, Gateway of the Squid, this one had me swaying a little. Personally, I like the idea of a transforming base/submarine VERY much. The way it is implemented is also quite good, but the overall design suffered a bit under the main function of this set. So I had to decide if I put more focus on the design or on the playability/functions.<br />
From the viewpoint of design, I would have only given it three stars. But I decided to put a bigger focus on the functions&nbsp;and playability. So, everything about the functions was said above, there is quite something to play with. The aspect of mobility makes this HQ unique amongst other bases and command centres. With one or two more minifigures or an additional small underwater creature the playability of this set would have increased even more, without using that much more pieces. That ray-guy looks a little lost to me...<br />
But, as with most sets of this series, even if it has some flaws on its own, it merges perfectly with the other sets to create an epic underwater-adventure environment.&nbsp;<br />
I&#39;m not going to spare you the negative points in design that had me thinking about three stars first. The docking part is so flimsy and looks very weak (even though it isn&#39;t). The scooter is a ridiculous piece with no real sense. The opened base has very little interior and the pilot&#39;s seat has not enough space to fit one of the divers properly. When in &quot;ship-mode&quot;, the whole thing looks very plump and not the least bit stream-lined. There are so many open spots in the construct, especially the large hole on the downside.<br />
With a little more effort in design, this would have been a clear five-stars set. Nonetheless, it makes a good command centre for the adventurers and quite a unique type of set.</p>
