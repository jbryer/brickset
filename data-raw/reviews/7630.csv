<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn't the first toy she immediately went for as there were other toys she wanted, but later in the day, she asked for help on opening this set and 5659 <a title=""View full details of set 5659: The Great Train Chase"" href=""../../detail/?Set=5659-1""><strong><FONT color=#4667a4>The Great Train Chase</FONT></strong></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was more interested in Bullseye and Jessie in this set then the actual blocks that come with it. Still a cute set and glad I got it for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's Duplo, Lego. They're honest and dependable throughout the years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're looking to get Bullseye, this is the set to get him from.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5

It was very fun and worth buying. It is of great quality.&nbsp;</p>
