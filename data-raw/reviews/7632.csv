"AETerry","2011-01-04T21:35:02.867Z","Great Train Chase Review","<p>I am basing this review off of how my daughter has responded to the set. This set along with 5657 <a title=""View full details of set 5657: Jessie's Round-Up"" href=""../../detail/?Set=5657-1""><strong><FONT color=#51abff>Jessie's Round-Up</FONT></strong></a>&nbsp;were part of some toys my daughter got at Christmas Time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While she didn't immediately jump to playing with this toy right away, she did later in the day, asking for help with putting it together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set comes with an instruction booklet as&nbsp;it is clearly a more complex build then the <a title=""View full details of set 5657: Jessie's Round-Up"" href=""../../detail/?Set=5657-1""><strong><FONT color=#51abff>Jessie's Round-Up</FONT></strong></a>&nbsp;and other buckets of just random Duplo blocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main draw in this set is the Train and being able to play with Duplo style minifigures of Buzz, Woody and Jessie. It's provided her with hours of fun being able to place them inside and push the train around.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"sideswinger","2019-11-05T18:02:34.257Z"," A Very Fun, Playable, Set","<p>So, when I was only 3 years old, my Grandpa got me this set. I was extremely excited and, being only 3, I got so much joy out of it, therefore I will be reviewing this from the eyes of myself when I was 3, with some more mature LEGO fan opinions as well.</p>

<p>1.Minifigures.</p>

<p>So the minifigure selection here is absolutely great and fantastic. It includes Woody, Buzz, and Jessie, which is the all three main characters, so that is just so awesome and very generous of LEGO. And to be honest, they all look pretty cool in their own way. I like Woody&#39;s torso printing, as well as his multi-molded hair and hat, and Buzz has some great face and torso printing too. And even though you can get Jessie in a cheaper set (which I also had when I was young,) it&#39;s a nice inclusion of the character with the other 2.</p>

<p>2.Building Experience.</p>

<p>So the experience I had when I built this, was pretty good. It was very simple for me, and I could take it apart and put it back together pretty easily. Of course, me being only 3, I did get some help from my parents in my first time building this, but after that i got the hang of it, and I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>3.Parts.</p>

<p>So when I was 3 you can probably imagine that i didn&#39;t really care for any &quot;rare pieces&quot; or &quot;nice prints&quot;. But looking back on it today, it does have a nice variety of pieces that could be added and used for the Duplo world. Like the flowers, which I really liked, and the fun I had with that cactus piece was unbelievable, so that&#39;s pretty cool. I do really like all the pieces that come on that train as well, like the pipe at front, and the 3 carts in back.</p>

<p>4.Playability</p>

<p>So as you can see from my rating, the fun I had with this set was just out of this world. I would sit and play with that train for hours on end, and not get bored in the slightest. I would set Buzz in front and Woody and Jessie in back, and drive it through that little tunnel build over and over again. So I would totally recommend it for kids.</p>

<p>5.Value</p>

<p>Now, the value of this set is pretty good. I think for $35 dollars, you get some great minifigures, and a whole lot of fun. And I mean a serious amount of fun.</p>

<p>So overall, this set is super nostalgic to me and after 9 years (almost 10) I think it holds up to this day. As I said, it was super fun to play with it with my older sister, my parents, and even by myself, it was still super fun.</p>
