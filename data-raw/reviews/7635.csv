<p>Absolute must have.</p>

<p>I picked up one at Target, they are clearancing the sets, which do make it worth the price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprising for the set and price, to have three cars characters, very happy about that.</p>
<p>Bold colors durable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However there is one con.&nbsp; When compared to the MegaBloks version of the cars sets.&nbsp; The megabloks does appear to have more solid plastic, and a little more ""character appeal"".&nbsp; So it will be interesting to see how Lego sets are in the Cars 2 series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can get the set on clearance, GET IT!</p>
