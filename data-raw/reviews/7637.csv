"jmkohl","2010-12-28T12:18:58.56Z","Cute set -- Surprisingly good game","<p>I had low expectations for the Harry Potter Hogwarts Game. My wife likes Harry Potter and I like Legos, so we received this set as a gift that would appeal to both of us. I was pleasantly surprised with how deep the gameplay can be.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is sturdy and includes an illustration on how to collapse the game for storage. There are two instruction booklets: one for building , and one for playing. The building instructions are quite clear. The playing instructions are also good, though the rules for shifting staircases are somewhat confusing. We had to read that part a few times before we understood the example. The instructions encourage players to experiment with their own rules, and include three variations on the basic rules you can try -- these add-ons incorporate Dumbledore, Mrs. Norris, and Wizard Dueling.</p>
<p>One tricky aspect of setting up the game is that the&nbsp;movable&nbsp;staircases and rules must be returned to their original configuration. Unless you have a brilliant mind for memorizing, you'll need to refer to the last page of the building instructions to restore the game to its original state.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts are fairly basic &quot;castle&quot; types. Lots of large rectangles to lay out the base and smaller pieces to add detail. There are a few special pieces, for example the Hogwarts coat of arms and the Marauder's Map. The color scheme is grey, brown, beige, and light green.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>There are nine microfigs: Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, Dumbledore, and one generic student from each of the four houses. There's also a Mrs. Norris cat, two spiders, and two frogs. The microfigs are cute but obviously not as detailed or fun as the minifigs in the Harry Potter series.</p>
<p>One obvious criticism for the microfigs is that you don't use the named characters (Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco) as part of the official rules. They are all the same color, so replacing them for the colored generic students could create confusion while playing. One idea we came up with was to put small colored pieces on their heads: Harry with a red dot on his head = the red character. It makes the game more fun for Harry Potter fans to use named characters instead of generic colors.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Building the game is fairly simple. You build the large base of the game (basically a square frame with detailing) and the 16 square tiles that move around the center. These include 12 &quot;staircases&quot; and 4 classrooms.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed game looks fun and whimsical. It doesn't look anything like Hogwarts, but you shouldn't have expected that from a game!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>In my opinion, the most important aspect of the Lego Games series is whether or not the game itself is worth playing more than once. The Harry Potter game definitely qualifies as both fun and strategic. Each player's action shifts the board, meaning you might have a plan for your next turn but by the time you roll the die, you're going to need to rethink your next steps. There's plenty of luck involved, especially if someone rolls a lot of the Marauder's Map which opens secret passages, but you never feel like you're out of it.</p>
<p>We found ourselves stumped at multiple times after rolling the die -- what's my best move?! That moment proved to us that the game is quite deep, meaning it will be fun for adults but also approachable for kids. It's easy to understand what you can do; it's quite difficult to understand what you SHOULD be doing!</p>
<p>If you like Harry Potter, Legos, and board games, this will be a fun addition to your collection.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"Elwood","2011-02-08T06:07:10.75Z","Shift and Rotate your way to victory!","<p>We played this over and over again. The parts are especially good for anyone who collects the Harry Potter theme sets. Not only are there the colouered minifigures but there are the bonus minifigures of Harry, Dumbledore and co.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game is both engaging and creative. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building is much more challenging (other than that of Ramses Pyramid) than other LEGO games, which you won't want to take apart once you've made it! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole rotating and shifting staircases movements works really well and makes for a competitive game.</p>

"TooMuchLEGO","2011-02-09T19:27:36.317Z","Best LEGO Board Game Ever","<p>This was one of my Christmas presents, and my fourth LEGO board game. It's one of my favorites. Everyone will like it, from die hard Harry Potter fans (like me) to people who could care less about Harry Potter (my sister). I've played it about...uh, I can't remember, I've played it so much!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is quite nice- it shows an angry Malfoy and a happy Harry, who is casting a spell, and this spell is holding the die in midair. Either Harry Wingardium Leviosa'd it when Malfoy was rolling it, or Malfoy is mad that he didn't think of it. Oh well- the ""outer box"" (the part that doesn't show the picture) shows about half of the figures you get and the game times as usual. LEGO did a good job on the box art. Well done, LEGO!</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>There are a LOT of nifty and neat pieces in here- for instance it includes some flags, transparent LEGO heads, toads and spiders, and many more. To me the microfigures and the die stand out the most- you can only get dice in LEGO Game sets and Microfigures are just plain awesome- they remind me of those old LEGOLAND set minifigures. If you are trying to make an addition to Hogwarts Castle but don't have the pieces, then this set might be your answer- it has many pieces to build another Tower for Hogwarts.</div><h4>Microfigures</h4><p>The microfigures are awesome. These microfigures show every day students and some of the main characters of HP- the trio, Malfoy, and Dumbledore. My final word is that they are fantastic.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is somewhat...well, boring. There's a lot to build, but most of it is building the something like four times. Not a big deal, but it is kind of boring.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall this set is great, fun, and I hope you hope you get it! :-)</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"BubblesMaster","2011-12-07T14:25:42.91Z","Harry Potter Hogwarts Game","This was my first Lego game and&nbsp;I've played it multiple times, while really enjoying with friends and family.&nbsp;It comes with nine microfigs, Gryffindor figure, Hufflepuff figure, Ravenclaw figure, Slytherin figure, and Dumbledore. It also comes with Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco Malfoy, all who are there for you to create your own game with them. The point of the game though, is to be the first to collect all the items (Potion, Animal, Homework item, and a Divination Orb) and get back to your common room.&nbsp;Pretty simple, but it's kinda hard when other players are trying to keep you from winning using pretty much anything they can use. The game has really dominated night after night in my house, and I have to thank lego for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;",FALSE,5,4,4,5,5
"HungerGamer","2014-03-17T19:56:52.99Z","Harry Potter Hogwarts Review","<p>The Harry Potter Hogwarts Board Game is an amazing set! I first came across this set on my birthday and immediately started to build. I have played this set several times with my family. For what it is worth it is a pretty good set which includes 9&nbsp;mini figures and many animal objects. Does break quite easily when playing. I do not recommend young children play this game due to the fact of very small parts. It is very enjoyable but does take up a long time. The set is quite simple to build if you are a Lego Builder, and is quite self explanatory. 7/10</p>
