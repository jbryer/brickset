But do you think LEGO could have gave a bigger area instead of the household.<div><br></div><div>For the good things. The good part of it is if you own the 2009 Construction Site you can now fill the building with furniture. The good set parts are:</div><div><ul><li>Christmas Tree: Has clear ball balls&nbsp;</li><li>Couch: Sporty</li><li>LEGO Toys: Cool</li><li>Santa's train: It has 3 carridges</li><li>Snowman: With as carrot nose and broom</li><li>Keyboard: Nice and small</li><li>Fireplace:A simple house design</li><li>Peoples designs:They match a family</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>The bad things were in a advent calendar there is around 8-9 people and in this one only How can you make a Christmas theme in your city. Parts bad are:</div><div><ul><li>Amount of people: Maybe 8</li><li>Pets food ball-Really they could have used a dish</li><li>Drum kit: They could have made it with gold pieces and bigger</li><li>Sleigh: They could have made a nicer design</li><li>Skate board ramp: They should have made it wider</li><li>Shower: To big</li><li>Log Cutting: They could have but a holder for logs</li><li>Table: it could be smaller</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>They also could have added presents and a TV and a computer with desk.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3

Absolutely fantastic designs all of them.</div><div><br></div><div>The snowman and Christmas tree are also nice, although pretty similar to the ones we have seen before.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The furniture/interior items are mostly ok: a fireplace/chimney, red sofa, and table with a lamp, and lots of those ubiquitous LEGO chairs of course. Santa's shower is the only one that's really new and funny.</div><div><br></div><div>The skateboard with ramp, drumset, keyboard and the wood sled with an axe are welcome additions to the set, although their actual playability value might be relatively low.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As always, there were some rare pieces/colors that are potentially useful for MOCing and fun food items like a couple of sausages and a tan French bread.</div></div><div><br></div><div>The box is well designed and unlike in our 2008 City Advent Calendar, everything was found in their right places, neatly packed and instructions printed on the numbered doors.</div><div><br></div><div>In summary, as far as City Advent Calendars go, this set is clearly a winner!</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"meyerc13","2010-12-27T16:55:23.077Z","My son lost interest","This is our second Lego City Advent Calendar, last year we actually had the 7907 Calendar from 2008.&nbsp; So for the purposes of this review I'll be comparing this set with that one.<br><br>The older calendar had lots of different City themes represented - Police, Fire, Construction, Train, Airport.&nbsp; This new calendar centers around a family (mother, father, son, daughter), their presents, and Santa.&nbsp; While I do like that this set includes a LEGO Santa (two actually), I don't see Santa getting much play time after the Holidays.&nbsp; While many of the small toys you could build were neat (crane, fire truck, helicopter), again I don't know that they'll see much playtime in my kids' LEGO City.<br><br>The saddest thing about this calendar was that my son lost interest half way through the month.&nbsp; At first, he would rush downstairs in the morning to open a door and put together a set before school.&nbsp; As the month progressed, eventually he started opening the door, but not bothering to put the set together.&nbsp; Eventually he even forgot about the calendar.&nbsp; Contrast that with last year where the calendar held his interest until the very last day, and clearly something went wrong this year.<br><br>While I could write on about the great parts (which there were) or the build of the models, ultimately if an advent calendar doesn't catch the interest of the kids it can't be a complete success.&nbsp; So I'll give this set four bricks for the parts and models that I appreciate, but can't give it five because it failed the 'kid test.'<br><br>Hopefully next year LEGO strikes a better balance between models that the kids can add to their LEGO City, and the holiday theme - which while nice isn't the year round focus of LEGO playtime in our LEGO City.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3

"LegitxLegos","2010-11-01T21:15:37.833Z","It's Okay. :P","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This set is okay. It has some pretty cool building techniques and pieces, but I think it could've been better. Nice value for money and makes a great addition to your city. This set is perfect for holiday displays or just to add to your lego neighborhood. (I did both.) It has a few AWESOME additions like the couch and bagette. So anyways, great set. 4/5 bricks...</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"TopperTwist","2010-12-24T17:37:48.917Z","Pretty Good!","<p>&nbsp;Although I've been collecting lego for a decade, this is my first Advent Calendar, and I'm pretty happy with it. This set cost $30 for 271 peices, which isn't too bad. The extra parts you get are much better than the usual extra studs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;The backround showing the 24 boxes is quite nice, showing a busy Lego city during the holiday season. The&nbsp;packaging of some of the days in the advent calendar is a bit weird, though, and sometimes hard to open without scissors. The folded down part of this set shows a house with an area to put a Christmas tree with a few other things and train tracks around the designated tree area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I love waking up each morning to a new Lego kit. Some of the best ones in my humble opinion are the train, toy plane, toy bulldozer, and of course, the naked Santa. I think the weakest of the set are the shower, log ensamble, and the table and chairs with lamp. </p>
<p>&nbsp;All in all, I think this Lego City Advent Calendar is a pretty good value, with easy to assemble builds. I reccommend getting this after the holidays while they are on sale :) because for the most part, you wouldn't wanna miss picking up this one.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"AETerry","2011-12-28T18:45:05.063Z","Belated 2010 City Advent Calendar Review","<p>On going to the 2011 Brickcon, I saw that one of the vendors there still had plenty of these for sale and with an opportunity presenting itself, I grabbed up this one and held onto it til December came. It was still priced reasonably too at $35.</p><p>This too was the calendar that once I started opening doors, ""got into trouble"" by my five year old daughter who wanted to open doors too. So we ended up doing all of the days together. For her, she rather enjoyed seeing a domestic scene unfolding and getting to play with figures or minikits.<br> </p><p></p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>As many know by now who've picked up any of the Advent Calendars, there is a flap that you can fold down depicting a scene where you can display any minifigures or minibuilds. There are doors for each of the 24 days before Christmas that you open on their respective days with instructions on how to assemble the minibuild or kit behind the flap.</p><p>I have to note though, that some days, the doors didn't seem to want to open very well without ripping or that polybags that minifigures and kits were packed in varied. Some days the polybag was an easy pull open and other days, the design of the bag required the use of scissors to open. It seemed very inconsistent on LEGO's part.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>For me, this was/is a great way to get a goodly number of pieces, that even if I don't keep the minibuilds together, I can use for other microscale models and ideas.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You'll get about 6-7 minifigures in this set, depending on if you count the dog as a minifigure or not. So Mom, Dad, Daughter, Son, Dog and 2 Santas.<br></p>
<h4>The build and the completed model</h4><p>I rather like the look of a Family's Christmas Morning display once all of the doors are opened and all the ""toys"" are out on the floor. It does seem a bit odd with all the trucks and planes, ect that it appears so much is geared towards the ""little boy"" in the set rather than anyone else in the LEGO family. Still, I see plenty of pieces for use in other MOCs.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I've enjoyed that an opportunity at the 2011 Brickcon allowed me a chance to pick up the previous year's City Advent Calendar as, speaking for myself, I liked the look of this one over the 2011 City Advent and had really hoped or wanted to get it before budget shortfalls took place.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"MemeLordJerry","2016-08-31T02:47:32.653Z","Great older set","<p>2824 has the old style Santa, but there are two of him, so if you&#39;ve thought about putting him in a beach scene, he is ready to go in a black Speedo. My set was missing two pieces, so I am waiting for a good deal on Lego.Com to get Pick-a-Brick replacements. The brick built snowman is awesome, and I cannot get enough of those. Awesome parts include skateboard, black suitcase, old style dog, and sausage for the dog. I guess bones weren&#39;t introduced until later. Mini toys include bulldozer, helicopter, plane, fire engine, and trencher (or is it a crane?). rounding out the set are the usual fireplace, tree, and train. Unique are drum kit, skate ramp, piano/organ, and Santa&#39;s shower. The couch is also nice. the included family consists of parts used before.</p>
