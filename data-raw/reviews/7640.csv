"KJM72","2010-05-02T09:50:18.967Z","Accurate and Nostalgic!","I got this set yesterday, May 1st, at my LEGO Store. It retails for $40 USD, and includes 4 minifigs.<div><br></div><div>The build is actually quite fun, in that you get to see the pizza-flinging function develop as you are building. It really starts coming together as you are building, the vehicle becoming more and more recognizable with each section built.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One thing I absolutely love about this set is that there isn't a single sticker on the set. The doors have a pizza planet logo, beneath which reads:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>DELIVERY SHUTTLE</div><div>Serving your local star cluster</div><div><br></div><div>That kind of detail makes this set so fantastic and cool to look at. Heck, there is even a bumper sticker on the back the reads ""YO"", just like in the movie! The license plate on the back reads ""RES1538"", which I m unsure about the significance of. It also says Toy Story 2010 along the top of the license plate.</div><div><br></div><div>The minifigs are pretty cool, IMO. Buzz and the Alien are the same from the winter sets, while Rex and Hamm are brand new. Hamm is awesome, with his curious looking eyebrows and a rubber stopper on the bottom. He has a slot on the top in which you can insert LEGO coins (not included), and remove the stopper on the bottom to retrieve them. Rex is adorable as well. He has tiny rubber arms that cannot move individually, but only as one. I'm not quite sure it the legs and tail are new.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Nice figs</li><li>Great detail on printed pieces</li><li>Instantly recognizable</li><li>Includes six pizzas</li><li>Looks great on display</li><li>All the figs piled in? Very funny.</li><li>Solid build, great playability&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>Relatively steep price</li><li>Pizza-flinging doen't work well (not surprising)</li></ul><div><br></div><div>I very highly recommend this set to a fan of the Toy Story and Pixar movies (the truck is an easter egg in nearly every Pixar movie), or someone who wants to get the figs at a smaller price.</div></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"Worker_Joe","2010-05-27T20:04:23.827Z","An OK set.","<p>I just picked this set up this morning and I thought it looked great with the 6 pizzas included. Sadly, I was wrong. The pizza shooting aspect of this set was HORRIBLE! The pizzas wouldn't fire! But, the rest of the set was great! This is one of the only sets with Rex and Ham [or Hamm?]... LGM [Little Green Man?] was one of the best parts! The pizzas are great and the truck is great for a LEGO City.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,3
"superdave","2010-11-29T08:35:33.273Z","Steep Price for a Great Set","The Pizza Planet Truck Rescue (not to be confused with the Duplo Pizza Planet Truck) has been on my wish list since the set first appeared. The selection of minifigs, new parts, and interesting features caught my eye immediately. Now that I have the set in my possession, I can say that it exceeded my expectations.<div><br></div><div><b>Price:&nbsp;</b>Although the price is steep at about $40 for 225 pieces, the 4 licensed minifigures (Buzz, Hamm, Rex, and an alien), printed parts, and exclusive status (Target and Lego are the primary retailers for this set) account for that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Build and Playability:&nbsp;</b>As a set, the build doesn't have many complicated sections (there is some studs-not-on-top building involved) and yields a surprisingly sturdy vehicle: I think a tumble from the table to the floor wouldn't knock more than a couple subassemblies loose. The truck is the perfect size (and durability) for zooming around the living room delivering pizzas (using the pizza-launching feature if desired) and rescuing aliens.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Parts:</b>&nbsp;The minifigs (a prime driver for purchases of this set, I'm sure) aside, the parts include a surprising amount of brown for a yellow truck with a white cap. Clear and transparent yellow and red elements serve as headlights and indicator lights. Yellow brackets hold the rear bumper in place. There are several new yellow slopes (large windshield and inverted windshield pieces) as well as a new white canopy element (the angular door on top of the cap that allows Rex to peek out). The high number of printed pieces- a rarity in recent licensed sets- includes the two 4x4 Pizza Planet door panels, 2x2 ""YO"" tile, 6 2x2 round pizza tiles, a 1x2 license plate tile, and the two windshields that serve as the side panels of the cap.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall:</b>&nbsp;Despite the high price, I was extremely satisfied with this set. Although it might be a stretch compared to lower price-per-element sets on the shelves, this licensed set carries a piping-hot cargo of minifigs and special parts sure to thrill any Pixar enthusiast, parts monkey, or pizza fan.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"CharlieTheFunEngine","2010-12-27T18:55:29.467Z","TinyTurbosCityAndToyStory Reviews Episode 20: Pizza Planet Truck Rescue","The Pizza Planet Truck was both my first Toy Story set and my first licensed set. The truck and the minifigures are spot on to the films.<br>&nbsp;<br><h4>Building Experience:</h4>Suprisingly complex. The inner workings of the pizza shooter are fun to build.<br><br><h4>Parts:</h4>Lots of parts that are new to my collection, like short legs, pizzas, the cone that you load the pizzas into, the hatch in the canopy for Rex's head and more.<br><br><h4>Playability:</h4>One of the most playable sets I own, entirely thanks to the pizza shooter. It reminds of the Basketball sets from the Sports theme with the spring-loaded minifigure legs. It's fun and functional.<br><br><h4>Value for Money:</h4>Ouch. I guess the licensing cost a bit much on this one and the price reflects that.<br>&nbsp;<br><h4>Overall:</h4>Great set to build and to play with, and it's hard to find a set that does both as well as this one does.",TRUE,4,3,4,5,3

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once built, it is very solid model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was very happy about the 'easy build"" with each bag as 1,2,3,4 etc...made it that much easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One con is the price, a bit pricey, for the size of the model but if youre a Disney, Toy Story fan you can over look that as I did.</p>

<p>Highly recommend this model.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,2
"J__B_","2011-01-07T15:47:55.587Z","Needs more pizzas...","This set should've had many <b>more pizzas</b>. You run out of ammo pretty fast! &nbsp;:)<div><br></div><div>Overall, the set is good. There were quite a few pieces that I had not seen before, and I was surprised when I found out the parts are printed. No stickers. I see pros and cons to printed vs. stickers, but was quite pleased when I realized no stickers were included. Stickers make sets look so cheap.</div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of cheap, this set wasn't... It definately should have been USD $29.99. Not sure what LEGO was thinking when they priced this. Maybe the printed pieces are harder to make. Anyway, it didn't matter to much, because I purchased this with a gift-card.</div><div><br></div><div>The playability is pretty good. I wished the wheels turned--I'm currently trying to figure out a steering mechanism that will fit. Also, one more minifig would have been nice. At least, at the price!

"Thebrickdoctor","2015-02-13T22:46:36.177Z","Great Set, and not just for the minifigures","<p>When this set was first released, I had grown out of the days when I loved Toy Story. Several years later, I saw this online for the same retail price from five years ago and so I asked for it for my birthday.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>The box has the same white background as the Toy Story 3 sets. It depicts the friends rushing to rescue Woody. I bought this online so I didn&#39;t get pulled in by the box art though it is still nice and depicts how to use the pizza shooter play feature. The instructions were not creased and were easy to follow, but the black pieces were not exactly the right colour in the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>There are 225 parts in this set which were in four numbered bags, with Rex in a separate bag. I am not really a parts expert, but from what I can see this set comes with some useful pieces. There are no stickers (yay!). I also love the inclusion of six pizza&#39;s, which somehow the first one&#39;s that I have ever received. I mean, what&#39;s a pizza planet truck without pizza!</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>Although I didn&#39;t just ask for this set for my birthday for the minifigures, they are truly brilliant. The Alien has a new molded head which looks great and just like the movie. Ham the pig is a molded piece with a removable cork at the bottom so that money can be put in just like a real piggy bank! Rex the dinosaur consists of four pieces. He has a smile on his face and can move both his arms up at once and both his legs. Now for the astronaut himself, Buzz Lightyear. Buzz looks fantastic with his flight suit, wings and helmet, I don&#39;t think they could&#39;ve made him any better, except by being able close his visor, which I assume would have been difficult to mold. All the minifigures are great, but I think Buzz is the stand out.</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>The build is not particularly hard, but is fun and at the&nbsp;slow pace I was building at,&nbsp;still only took 30-40 minutes. At a faster pace this build could be done in 20 minutes.</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>The completed model looks superb in my opinion, and makes me want to go out and buy more Toy Story sets. Compared to the one in the films, the truck looks spot on. The pizza launcher feature is not why I wanted the set, but for little kids I guess it would be fun. I love the little details, like the &quot;YO&quot; letters on the back of the truck and the number plate, which&nbsp;are the same as the movie. There are some few minor flaws that I think could have easily been fixed up. The window at the back of the truck was not added, which could have been, seeing as the piece already exists. Between the windscreen and the bonnet of the car&nbsp;are four tan coloured studs, which could have easily been covered up by a yellow 4X1 tile. Now that I think about it, that would restrict movement of the bonnet, so I can forgive that. The rocket is also a bit flimsy. Overall the final model is very good and my <span data-dobid=""hdw"">criticisms are really only nit picky things.</span></p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>This set was just what I hoped it would be and more. The inclusion of printed pieces over stickers is fantastic, as are the minifigures. The only thing about this set that really puts me off is the price. Back when this was available in retail stores five years ago, it cost around $80AUD. The price to piece ratio is pretty bad, but I can forgive it as this set is a real gem. If you can get this for a reasonable price don&#39;t hesitate.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this review, which is my first, I hope you enjoyed it and please tell me how I can improve it. Now I think I might just go off and get myself a pizza...</p>
