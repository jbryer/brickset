"blaksamu12","2010-08-17T00:51:52.153Z","Awesome!","<p>The Midi-Scale Imperial Star Destroyer is a lot better than it seems.&nbsp; Its really small, but it sure is awesome!&nbsp; I got it mainly because I wanted it to go with the Midi-Scale Millenium Falcon (read that review), but you should get it because its a great set!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>
<p>The build was a actually really good.&nbsp; The structure that hold it all together and ends up going inside the ship, has a very interesting build.&nbsp; Then you move onto the outside parts, which are fun but repetitive.&nbsp; The top is similiar to the bottom, but has a lot of extra detail.&nbsp; Then you have the back engines which are pretty nifty.&nbsp; Next, there is the top part, control area,which is large, but looks great.&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; there is a little stand on the bottom which helps for display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>
<p>The set doesn't have huge playability since its not minifigure scale, but its perfect size for flying around since it can be held firmly in your hand.&nbsp; It doesn't really bother me though, because the detail is amazing and the set looks great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Value for Money:</strong></p>
<p>The set may be tiny, but its detail is unbelievable for the sets size, the the set is worth every penny.&nbsp; Its really small but it has 423 pieces, so its atcually a great deal.&nbsp; Besides, it much better prices than all the other new Star Wars sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>
<p>The Midi-Scale Star Destroyer is awesome.&nbsp; It has a great price,&nbsp; is fun to build, and is perfect for display. The is limited playability, but its a total must have for Star Wars collectors.&nbsp; It also goes really well with the Midi-Scale Millenium Falcon.&nbsp; Overall, I highly recommend it, it is AWESOME!</p>

"legoDad42","2011-01-09T22:39:02.013Z","Beautiful Symmetry!","<p>The Kuat Drive Yards&#39; <strong>Imperial Star Destroyer</strong>&nbsp;is a wonderful kit with great, symmetrical designs and lines throughout. While mostly being a display model....it has some &#39;swooshability&#39;!</p>

<p>It&#39;s a <em>&#39;Special Edition&#39;</em> Midi-Scale kit with 423+ pieces, over 9.5 inches long, nicely designed (especially the engines), good build (not great but not boring), nice weight/heft to the model and also&nbsp;comes with a&nbsp;simple, effective display stand. Makes a great desktop model.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I broke down, below, various aspects of the kit &#39;euro-brick&#39; style as best I could with photo&#39;s and captions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>

<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN3972-1.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>It was pleasant to find the instruction manual flat and in mint condition (not used to that). It&#39;s a 48 page booklet with clean, clear building instructions and a nice spec/details page.</p>

<p>Below is a random page of instructions...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Parts</h4>

<p>No real unique parts but all are very useful especially all the angled plates and smooth tiles.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the parts list from the instruction booklet. <em>Note the back of the box has the same parts list but with a better looking blue background and white lettering...</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>

<p>No mini-figs for a Midi-Scaled model.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<p>I found the build to be very satisfying. It&#39;s not a great build and some repetition but overall I found some useful techniques especially this section below. It&#39;s the core of the model and holds all the &#39;wing&#39; sections, bridge/tower, engine and display stand(which is removable). Clever in my opinion...</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN3994-1.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>This is one beautiful display model but there are some con&#39;s though. You&#39;ll notice gaps between the top and bottom sections which for the most part aren&#39;t too noticeable except for the front where you can see through it too much. Not sure how to fix that. Also from time to time the engines can fall off during play.</p>

<p>But...like I said before...nice lines throughout, great for display especially on your desktop at work (dreaming of conquering the galaxy...;), decent for parts especially now if you can get it on sale below the $40.00 retail and it&#39;s quite <em>swooshable</em>.</p>

<p>The Empire would be proud of such a representation of their awesome, wedge-shaped Imperial-Class Star Destroyer...the core of their navy...<strong>build</strong> and behold its might...!</p>

(and I can't find the minifigs and I wanted to get this since I got my&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;Falcon.)<div><br></div><div>This Imperial Scale Destroyer is the counter part to the 7778&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;Falcon. Overall this set did some stuff right which the 7778 did wrong - NO STICKERS! man i hate stickers. xP They also included a stand in the design (i thought they have extra stand so if we want to use it we could, but apparently they add it into the design), and things do not fall out as easily as 7778. Oh man I remember holding the Millennium Falcon and things start to fall out...</div><div><br></div><h4>Time</h4><div>I took awhile to build this, about 2 hours. It doesn't look like it needs so much time but there are a lot of tiny details that i always forget so i have to flip back to see what i missed out.&nbsp;</div><p><br></p><h4>Building experience</h4><div>Man this is bad. (SPOILERS) You have to build 4 similar steps over and over again. Okay, 2 sets of mirror images. It gets boring after awhile. And the center part that holds them together feels kind of&nbsp;flimsy. Because they are mirror images, and i didn't sort the pieces out (there are only 300pieces...) I kept getting the wrong pieces (mirror images).</div><div>However, when everything is finally add together, it feels kind of awesome. the designer is smart. xD</div><p><br></p><h4>Okay, now, Pros and Cons.</h4><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Cheap. (for me. i got it because of rollback)</li><li>Complete the sets with&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;Falcon.</li><li>Cool building techniques. Seriously. Cool.&nbsp;</li><li>Nice build-in stand.</li><li>Looks awesome. Trust me when you finish it you will be like Ahhhhh~</li></ul><div>Cons:</div></div><div><ul><li>Some parts are still falling apart; but much better than 7778.</li><li>Gets repetitive after awhile.</li><li>No minifigs. But this is a model. Oh well.</li></ul><p><br></p></div><h4>Conclusion?</h4><div>If you are either (a) Star wars fan (b) have&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;Falcon (c) want to display a lego star wars model on top of your CPU, this is a must buy.

LOTS OF EM!","<p>If you're a builder who likes wing pieces, and needs them for building custom military and space models, this set is your new best friend. Think of it as a ""Creator"" set themed to starships. Mostly gray pieces, many of them wings and other plates, plus more than a few interesting parts to create a variety of stream lined metallic vehicles.</p><p>If you're under the age of 12, and are less into model kits and more into playtime, this is NOT a good buy. Though there are hinges and such essential to shaping the destroyer, once assembled it has NO moving parts! So the only options for playtime are...</p><p>A: Pick it up (carefully) and making ""Whooosh... Zoooom....Ka-pew... BOOM!"" Noises.</p><p>B: Take it apart and building something else.</p><p>I was very fortunate to get mine for around $20, but it's still worth the retail for the nicely themed and useful parts. Directions were easy enough, but it's a 2-4 hour project and if you're not patient, or watching something (Like Season 1 of Star Trek DS9...) while assembling it, you might need a break or two while working on it. Plus if you're not experienced with how to read LEGO instructions and used to defining the small differences between bricks of similar shape and color, an almost all-gray-wing set might be frustrating or lead to mistakes.<br></p><p></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Accurate looking for this scale and brick style<br></li><li>A Creator-lover's dream for gray, wing, airplane/ship parts</li><li>Decent price for the theme, style, variety, and amount of bricks</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Large, heavy, fairly delicate, and no moving parts... NOT a good playtime toy<br></li><li>Intermediate building experience suggested</li><li>Not a good starter if you want more variety of part types and colors<br></li></ul>
<p>This set was not designed with Kids in mind, or at least not as a plaything or toy. This set is for the bigger kids, teens, and adults who enjoy model kits and collectibles. In other words if you see Toys as cool, displayable, collectible items... or just need a ton of gray wing pieces for your LEGO projects, then the force is strong with this one! Otherwise, if you're more into mini figures, playability, and cool working parts/effects, then much to learn you still have young padawan, yes?<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,1,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The ship is instantly recognizable, and is great because of the many different gray shades, and is also superior because of the engines and other great details.<br></li><li>-The stand is great and necessary for this display model, even though it isn't really a part of the ship.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>

"Chills","2013-01-15T10:49:24.92Z","A great version of the backbone of the Imperial Navy","<p>My recent Lego quest has been to collect all the Star Destroyers and I found this MISB one on eBay for well under RRP; so I snapped it up. It's my first MIDI scale set and I must say I wish Lego would make more of them. I have Star Destroyers 10030 and 4492, and this version sits right in the middle with size, detail, and price.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First off Lego did a great job with detail, the ship looks exactly like it does in the movies. The general shape is right on the money, with angled hull plates coming down to the bow and broadening out for the stern. Underneath you have the two docking bays and the bulge for the reactor; plus a small stand to keep the ship level for display. The sides are nicely greebled, as are the sides of the superstructure. The top of the ship has a good amount of detail, as well. I like how Lego uses specialized plates for the greebles, from the sides of the superstructure to the front of the bridge tower. There are even 6 turbo lasers along the sides.</li><li>Pro 2: I like how Lego didn't make this set all one color. 10030 is pretty much the same grey all over, and Lego uses smatterings of darker greys throughout this set. They even use other colors inside the ship, which I always find fun. This set has lots of plates and wings, so it is useful for other space-themed MOCs.</li><li>Pro 3: The build was pretty fun. Lego uses technic bricks hinged on one end and locked with other bricks on the other for the main spar. Then clamp plates to attach the hull pieces to the main spar inside, which makes this set sturdy and swooshable. Other reviews mention this set being fragile, but I don't see it. As long as you're not clamping down hard on the sides with your hands this set won't fall apart. Its definitely more sturdy than 10030.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Lego did a great job with size, relative dimensions, and detail; however there is one part of the ship that bothers me: the bridge tower. From the front the actual bridge section is an elongated hexagon, but this set has a flat bottom and 45 degree slopes on the top corners. Not very close to the actual shape of the movie Star Destroyer.</li></ul>
<p>Overall I'm quite pleased with this set. The price/piece count is really good, especially for a Star Wars set. Plus, you can find MISB examples for under RRP making it quite a bargain.&nbsp;I would recommend this set to any SW collector out there. Though there's a lack of playability, there's nice detail included in the set, it was a fun build, and the ship looks great with the other Star Destroyers out there. I wish Lego would make more MIDI scale SW ships, but I guess that's up to us fans to MOC our own.</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,2,4
"zipsforbananas","2012-07-13T14:25:19.36Z","A brilliant little set, but really for display only.","<p>So, what can you say? This is by far the best representation of the Star Destroyer yet, it beats 10030, and 6211 hands down. That said, it's pretty small!! I guess that sums it up. (But on the other hand, isn't small good for a Star Destroyer? Let's not kid ourselves that 6211 and 10030 were remotely close to scale.... :P)</p><p>It's wonderfully detailed, with a lot of touches that will make you smile, but it'll only work as part of the background to a scene, rather than part of being played with. The build is enjoyable, and it does go together rather cleverly and well (the clips are far better than magnets, but to be fair the method of fixing is pretty much determined by the size). But it does also come apart quite easily and is fiddly to put back together. The engine piece is prone to being knocked off as it's only held on by 2 studs, and the 'wings' do have a degree of movement and squeeze it loose.</p><p>If you're into mangling sets, or MOCs then there are loads of great wing pieces.</p><p>Yep, I'm running out of things to say! If you like the look of it, that's about it! What you see is what you get. Personally, I love it, but if you want to swoosh it, or move it, or do anything more than build a stand for it to sit on, hovering majestically over your Imperial troops, then it's not really for you. Unfortunately there isn't an alternative either, as the older versions are bland, slightly misshapen, and a bit too big.</p><p>I guess the big plus is that it was prone to being heavily marked down towards the end of it's sale life, so it's pretty good value if you can get it for £25 or less!
</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Excellent likeness to the film</li><li>Nicely detailed - clips looking greeble-like, and binoculars for guns!</li><li>Fun build</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Easy to break - just pick it up if you want to see!</li><li>Limited usefulness, but that's not really a con if you want to display it.</li></ul>
