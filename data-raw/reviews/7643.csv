"Agreenbrick","2010-07-28T18:25:52.64Z","Made my day...","<p>I never thought these would come to sweden BEFORE august, but they did, and there were like four boxes of these and three boxes of series 1 spread around the toy store.</p>
<p>So before I knew it, I was sitting in the car with all of them (one of each fig, not the boxes). I can barely describe how happy I felt, because now, I had ALL of them!! Both series one and series two!</p>
<p>Anyway, since I have all of them, let's review them all shortly:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>dompteur/liontamer</b>: Nice to have a new color for the new whip piece, but not that unique. 3/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>explorer</b>: No new pieces, only new colors.</p>
<p>3/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Traffic cop</b>: The most boring figure.</p>
<p>2/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>skier</b>: One of my six favorites. I hope they make more of those hats!</p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Surfer</b>: Not unique in any way, and the headpiece is clearly a skater boy head from series1 with brown eyebrows, and missplaced beard. My first surfboard tho! :)</p>
<p>2/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Mexican</b>: Another one of my favorites! Sombrero, maracas, what is there left to say?</p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>lifeguard</b>: Good, because of the new floating thing, but still not completely perfect.</p>
<p>3/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Disco guy/ DJ</b>: Another favorite. I just love that afro hairpiece!</p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Pharao</b>: Nice pieces But not a favorite.</p>
<p>4/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Mime artist</b>: Yet another favorite. It's good they finally make a lego mime artist!</p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Vampire</b>: Good, but there's already A black hairpiece like that one, &quot;worn&quot; by the karate guy/ judoka. I'd prefere the joker hairpiece, but black, instead of this one.</p>
<p>4/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Witch</b>: Kind of boring, since there was already a witch in the 2008 castle advent calendar, but this one&nbsp;has a green head, so It's not worth only one of five...</p>
<p>2/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Popstar</b>: Favorite! very detailed hairpiece, and finally a LEGO MICROPHONE!!</p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Judoka / Martial artist</b>: My absolute favorite of them all! I just love these martial arts, and that little golden minifig trophy is A perfect award even for other lego events!</p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Spartan/ Antique warrior</b>: Believe it or not, but this is not one of my favorite figs. It's still cool tho, and comes with three new pieces.</p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Weightlifter</b>: A great fig, but the weight is not a single piece as I had hoped... Oh well, this do allows you to make the bar between the weights longer, by replacing it, so Why complain?</p>
<p>3/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, they're a great buy, but for this series, only if you have all of them in my opinion.</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,4
"Zacherano","2010-10-02T13:33:54.4Z","Phenomenal Selection, What Fun!","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lego Group has really outdone itself this time, in more than one sense.&nbsp; Teenage and adult collectors, such as myself, avidly search out and purchase large amounts of these addictive figures through the brick-and-mortar stores and over the Internet.&nbsp; Children and their parents jointly enjoy the unique building and trading experience.</p><h4>A Resounding Success</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say that despite some criticism of the ""trading card"" mentality that surrounds, or will soon surround these figures, Lego has been successful both economically and constructively.&nbsp; Lego has inadvertently allowed differentiation between individual figures when purchasing in person on the past two minifigure series, but this will not remain for series 3 and 4, slated to come out in January and April of 2011.&nbsp; The figures, nonetheless, will undoubtedly still be a resounding success next year.&nbsp; <br><h4>Important Attributes<br></h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that there are a number of attributes that jointly make these figures both desirable, displayable, and overall a great Lego product.&nbsp; First and foremost are the variety of new figures and parts.&nbsp; Some parts, such as the clown's bugle in series 1, the pop star's mic in series 2, and the karate master's miniature golden minifigure trophy in series 2, stand out.&nbsp; In addition, many of the figures have new hairpieces and rare leg printing.&nbsp; Despite their production in China, degrading the quality of the minifigure plastic itself, these figures reign supreme in the current Lego market, though this will only last for a few more weeks from today, October 2, 2010, at the most. <br></p><h4>Singularity<br></h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These figures are also so coveted for their obvious appeal in singularity, such as the unprecedented presence of figures such as the Spartan in series 2 and the cheerleader in series 1.&nbsp; These figures really top the sales even more as collectors search through the boxes for the ""rare"" and ""cool"" ones that they want the most, picking up a few more along the way.&nbsp; The Spartan, for example, is actually a rare figure, as per my conversations with sales representatives who are fans of TLG, there is only one Spartan per box of 60 figures!</p><h4>Drawbacks<br></h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, that is the drawback to these figures - even with the identifying barcodes, which some consider morally wrong to use, it is quite challenging to obtain the ones you want.&nbsp; While I personally have obtained a full set of 16 for both series, others may want multiples or singles of certain figures and refrain from purchasing others.&nbsp; While the inexpensive price point, $2, renders the figures readily available to people's pocketbooks, it really adds up when you buy too many and keep buying more to get the ones you want.&nbsp; I know other collectors and parents who have taken many a trip to the store to buy the necessary figures, as the online medium, except through second-party sellers on Bricklink, eBay, and Amazon, does not provide the differentiation between individual figures.&nbsp; <br></p><h4>Conclusion<br></h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am starting to ramble on a bit, so I will come to a close.&nbsp; Bottom line: these figures are all the rage for Lego customers and fans now, so buy them while you still can.&nbsp; I can think of few cons relating to these figures except for the rareness of certain figures over others.&nbsp; <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for all your time in reading my review!&nbsp; :-) </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Firox_5000","2010-10-04T13:55:29.97Z","Bring on series 2","<p>Following on from the amazing and successful series 1 series 2 is now finally availible. The figures come in small plastic bags and the twist is you dont know which one you will get. The last series was very good but this lot is absolutly fantastic! </p>
<p>You get one of 16 availible figures, some more unique than others and others better. these figures are, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mexican [mr maraca's]</p>
<p>A figure with a printed&nbsp; poncho and some unique maraca pieces. This figure is very unique and good and has a pretty neat and large head. 8/10 , one of the best</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roman spartan</p>
<p>Perhaps the best of the series 2 figures, He has a cool spear sword as well as an amazing cape and cool helemt,10/10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lion Tamer/Circus ring master</p>
<p>Well Not a bad one he has a nice whip piece and goes well with the series 1 clown. 6/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Witch</p>
<p>Wow, one I suggest you try and get, it's been a very long time since we have seen a lego witch. This figure also goes well with the Vampire one, 8/10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vampire</p>
<p>One of the best figures in the series I think. This guy has neat printing and a clasic bat piece and good cape,9/10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traffic cop</p>
<p>Well , he has some nice pieces and is good for a prison setting but does not have the edge compared to many better figures e.g mexican,vampire. 6/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explorer</p>
<p>Good to see an old school style minifig similar to those in the old Johnny thunder line. He has some nice acceseries such as a magnifying glass and binoculars. Bring on the classics 7/10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life guard</p>
<p>Great amazing figure with good detail, one to boost your female fig collection with, 7/10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mime artist</p>
<p>Nice figure with strange heads,a bit strange but a unique one, 6/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weight lifter</p>
<p>not as unique as others but is a nice addition too add to town scenes and has a nice unique weight piece. 6/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pop star/singer</p>
<p>Another amazing female figure with a very unique mic piece. 7/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skier</p>
<p>A great fig with amazing ski pieces and is one I want to find, 9/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>disco Stu</p>
<p>Cool guy with funky hair do and clothing 7/10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Karate Master</p>
<p>Goes well with the series 1 Ninja and has amazing unique trophy piece,8/10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surfer</p>
<p>A figure that goes well with every town set 8/10, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pharoah</p>
<p>Probably the third best fig 9/10. Must have for a history setting or those who want to make a lego museum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So overall the majority of these figures are fantastic and are must have figures for your collection. Go and find them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet I think to be honest i dont like them being bags where you cant see the figure you get which you could get ripped off and get duplicate figures e.g 2,3,4 or even 5 of the same kind if you are very unlucky!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These figures are great but just be warned!</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,3
"Doctor_Leg_O_Brick","2010-10-25T11:42:21.627Z","Sorry, but this is the best series out of one and two.........","<p>This has to be the best series, and from pictures i don't think that series 3 will beat this. Anyway, on to the review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mariachi</p>
<p>Rating:9.97/10</p>
<p>I&nbsp;love his poncho, his maracas are fantastic and his sombrero is 4 studs wide!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spartan warrior</p>
<p>Rating:17/10</p>
<p>Just...just...well.....AMAZING!! New sheild, new spear, new body, new legs, new head new everything!! Get this figure!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ringmaster</p>
<p>Rating:8/10</p>
<p>Hes good, i like his whip and top hat. My first top hat you see so hes good. Like the torso included on this guy and his face is classic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Witch</p>
<p>Rating:8/10</p>
<p>Sorry all witch haters but i like this figure. I have not got the hat, nor the broom so this figure is good for me. She will go well with the trolls i have got yesterday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vampire</p>
<p>Rating:10/10</p>
<p>Love this figure. My first bat. Its a little hard to put his cape on as you fold and double fold to get it around his neck. I must defend his cape as people say its not red and black, but if you have the studios cape from that set or bricklink, why not put the red one on the inside and the black one one the inside like in 10199??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traffic cop</p>
<p>Rating:9/10</p>
<p>Why so many bad ratings, i think this figure is one of the best. Hes got flying glases, good for top gun MOCs, a real nice printed speeding ticket and a two pairs of handcuffs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explorer</p>
<p>Rating:10/10</p>
<p>One of the best. This will go for big money when pharaoh's quest comes out. He comes with two pairs of binoculars, a magnifying class and a hat used on most explorers. His head is new, along with printed legs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life guard</p>
<p>rating:8/10</p>
<p>This figure, named ""baywatch babe"" by some, is OK. I like the bouy in this set, and my first agent trace hair, plus it goes well with my beech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mime</p>
<p>Rating:8/10</p>
<p>Hes good, but not the best. Like his beret, his 3 heads and&nbsp;his printed arms.</p>
<p>If you have one spare like me, you could make it female by adding a female hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weightlifter</p>
<p>Rating:10/10</p>
<p>Yet another great figure. A small weight is included, and printing on front and side of the legs which is cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pop star</p>
<p>Rating:9/10</p>
<p>A good figure to add to my city. Spare parts wise you get a microphone witch is usefull anywhere in anyone collection. The head is very detailed&nbsp;with make up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skier</p>
<p>Rating:10/10</p>
<p>New skis, new ski poles, new hat, new head, new legs...Is there any way you can give it a lower score than 10?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disco dude</p>
<p>Rating:9/10</p>
<p>Lovelly figure! His record is great with ""brick fever"" on it. Same hair as the clown from series 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Karate master</p>
<p>Rating:10/10</p>
<p>Great figure! Spare parts this time include a golden trophy. The hair has been used on count Dooku, but never has it been used in black before series two as the vampire uses this guys hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surfer</p>
<p>Rating:10/10</p>
<p>Yet another figure with so many uses.&nbsp;I gave him the blue car from 5898. Same hair as the skater from series one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pharaoh</p>
<p>Rating:10/10</p>
<p>Last one on the list, last one i needed. Great figure, love that staff, his head dress is nice because you can stick a stud on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this ""set"" is great, get them all if you can, thanks for reading,</p>
