<p>Challenging to build with some unique use of tile pieces, the massive stiker sheet makes it difficult to build and dismantle as the stickers generally cover brick joins.</p>
<p>Some cool wheel details and my only real critisism is the poor join at the roof and windscreen point. There is no 'locking' in of position and the flexible hinge use on the base of the windscreen means that the fram distorts during play. find for display though which is my purpose. My son was frustrated, but on the tile, boy she rolls a long way. Very sturdy in that regard.</p>

<p>Previous 1:17 models have never really felt 'correct' i.e. Ferraris tend to be more organic in form and the basic brick construction make it challenging. Probably why LEGO had to mask or enhance details with decals (The Enzo &amp; FXX are an exception &amp; look great). Lamborghinis of late tend to be more angular - that's a good design starting point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the decals and being a Polizia version, this model has a high level of authentic Gallardo lines, the aggressive front splitter, bonnet-windscreen interface, rear exhausts, side air intakes, etc just to name a few! &nbsp;And the great touches of clever opening doors with angled slope bricks.</p>
<p>Compared with the civilian Gallardo 8169, thankfully LEGO learnt lessons i.e. the front lamps are now purely bricks, with a nice touch of 1x1 round plate inside, almost like a HID headlamp. The shape is spot on, as with the front bumper side diffusers. In comparison the horrid part cheese-slope, part decal front lamp of the 8169. There's a 6x6 tile I never knew existed, that really help give the correct Lambo lines in front. Pity about the rear decal lamps though, but I've replaced them with a combo of trans red cheese slopes and 1x1 tiles. Simple, and still true to the facelifted rear lamps. Another minor detail was changing the 1x2 plate above the rear arch to a tile piece for an absolutely smooth fender.</p>
<p>I didn't attach decals (shall leave the issue as itself as it's being discussed ad infinitum for most other 1:17 sets) except that in homage to the car, all Lambo badges were used. &nbsp;Still a very decent looking sportscar! My next project is to mod the civilian version with some of these details. Or build an orange SuperLeggera =)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other comments:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Construction is sturdy despite that the A-pillars arent connected to the roof. They are rather stiff and would take a kid to really toss it around to move the hinged points</li>
    <li>Rims look great despite being hubcaps, secretly wishing LEGO made real rims...&nbsp;</li>
    <li>All wheels are independent &amp; as such quite fun to vroom around, secretly wishing the front wheels swivel (i know it's impossible at this scale...) &amp; have suspension, even 3mm travel would make my day!</li>
    <li>There's a little blue Transporto Organi (Organ Carrier) with trans red &amp; clear 1x1 rounds &amp; this means for the first time LEGO has actually represented human organs in a model!&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the little details do work &amp; I've been enjoying this model everyday still even just to push around. Now what car next LEGO? &nbsp;Can't wait!</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,3
