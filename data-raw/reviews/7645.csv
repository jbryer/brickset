<p>IDEAS:Maybe luke skywalkers head should have a dual faced head on the other side he should have&nbsp;a face thats close to Zef Sensaca.&nbsp;lego should stop giving every single Hoth rebel heads and give them different heds for once. I don't think they needed to add C-3PO and Han Solo in the set and were is the bomb luke throws in?&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,3
"Darth_Shockwave","2010-08-05T16:33:52.623Z","An impressive updated model.","<p>Well here we have the third release of the iconic AT AT walker from Empire Strikes Back, and I have to saw it's quite impressive. I would certainly say this model is better than the 2007 motorised version, but just slightly behind the original 2003 model. The best way to describe the look of this model&nbsp;is, a mixture of both of the previous designs, which is not a bad thing. For example the head has been designed very simlar to the original model designs, but with an improved neck design and guns. The side armour panels have a more simple design to it, like the 2007 motorised version, and so forth. The new model does have some very good features, like inside the main body, there is a small removable platform for General Veers and several Snowtroopers to sit on. the top of the head has a much better opening hatch, which is fitted much better than the 2003 model. The addition of extra minifigures is great, the previous AT AT's only had four minifigures each, this model has eight, and one is completly brand new, which is Bespin/Hoth Han Solo a minifigure which is long over due, I know the box says new General Veers minifigure, but you can make a General Veers from existing minfigures. The other minifigures are great too, we've got a pilot Luke Skywalker, with a new designed pilot suit and helmet, a gold C 3PO, another Rebel trooper, an AT AT driver, and 2 Snowtroopers. We also have included a Rebel defence turret, perfect for trying to blast Imperials. There are a couple of slight problems though, the biggest one is, it's smaller then the previous 2003 model, and only slightly taller than the 2007 model. Some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;pieces only very loosely attached and can come flying of if your not careful.</p>
<p>Pro's: -</p>
<p>More minfigures + unique minfigures.</p>
<p>Enjoyable to build.</p>
<p>Great to look at.</p>
<p>Snowtroopers.</p>
<p>Another accurate design.</p>
<p>Improved neck design,&nbsp;the head is&nbsp;not going to fall of in the breeze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Con: -</p>
<p>A little smaller than what it should be, due to less parts about 150 less or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I like this version, not as much as the 2003 model, but more than the 2007 model. It's an enjoyable build, and the addition of extra minifigures and accesories certainly improve the playability. Definitley worth picking up, especially if you've missed out on the last 2 models, this is you third chance to pick one up.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,3

"J0rgen","2010-08-13T21:39:17.533Z","The final touch to my Hoth collection!","<p>Since the Hoth-edition of Millenium Falcon I've been collecting Hoth sets, I've bought every Hoth set since then, except the Motorized Walking AT-AT, thus, I needed this set to make my collection complete. </p>
<p>The 2003 edition of the AT-AT is, as far as I can tell, the most accurate to date, it's a bit larger than this one and a bit more detailed. From the box-art I did'nt think this looked too good, but it was like that new Boba Fett minifigure, once I saw it in real life, I loved it! Even though this IS smaller than the 2003 edition, it's still very big, it reaches the top floor of the Death Star and I don't think I have any other&nbsp;vehicle that can match it in height. So, exterior-wise it's great, but, the interior is lousy. There's a lot of empty space inside, there's only a small control platform, which is made to look like the cockpit from the movies. Luckily there's lots of potential for making your own interior! The cockpit seats only one&nbsp;driver, but I guess that's allright, it's not excactly to scale anyway. The head moves nicely from side to side, with a sturdy neck. The legs work fine too, they're sturdy, nicely detailed and they bend like they should.</p>
<p>That takes care of the main vehicle, now, in this set we get an interesting selection of minifigures. Let's start with the long awaited Han Solo with flight jacket, we've been waiting for this minifigure for ages and I can think of at least three sets it should have been included in earlier, but now it's finally here, even though it's an odd set to include it in. The same goes for the C-3PO figure, why C-3PO and Han have been tossed right into the battlefield, I guess we'll never know. The enemies included in this set are excactly the same minifigures you get in the Snowtrooper Battle Pack, but they fit better in here. Personally, I think General Veer's face and light grey helmet look a bit weird, but it's just to put on the head and helmet from the last AT-AT or AT-ST. The new AT-AT pilot's helmet still looks really good, a great improvement over the old ""stormtrooper"" one. Luke's got a new helmet, which looks really good, but he has a plain face, I was hoping for a face with the orange glasses. Finally there's the ""rebel trooper"" I don't understand why they use this torso for ordinary troopers, this is an officer's jacket! Luckily his hat can replace yet another white ""pilot helmet"", so it's okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PRO's:</strong></li>
<li>Nice exterior.</li>
<li>Sturdy neck.</li>
<li>Han Solo with flight jacket.</li>
<li>More detailed version of Luke's pilot helmet.</li>
<li>AT-AT Pilot</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CON's:</strong></li>
<li>Lack of interior.</li>
<li>Ordinary face for Luke.</li>
<li>(This is really a fault for the Snowspeeders)Snowspeeders cable doesn't reach all the way around.</li>
<li>Smaller than earlier version, it's not that big a problem, but it is a bit unfair...</li>
<li>Not a proper rebel trooper.</li>

<p>&nbsp;The minifigs,the new Han Solo is great with flight jacket and then theres your standerd c3po,plus theres a hoth rebel trooper.The only problem with the rebel is that the goggles look redicoulous when there down.Also theres a Luke Skywalker in pilot suit.(the grapling hook is a whip?!)And theres all the figures from the snow tropper battle pack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also theres a neat little Hoth defense dish.Now on to the walker!First,the thing is huge!And it&nbsp;wont fall over unless you really push it.The head&nbsp;sways side to side nicely and the side guns rotate 360 degrees.The body is mainly panels and the main hold is fairly decent in size,except it looks a little short.Theres a tray/floor thing with a computer and blaster rack,and seats 3 but has standing room for 4 plus the imperial officer.The back is a flat panel with pistols as part of it.Theres enough room to put a speeder bike upside down in side it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only real complaint is that the lower&nbsp;leg armor comes off pretty easily.Over all this set is great come back,good to displayas well as play.Get it if you can afford it(I got it for my birthday!!)so,start saving because it is worth it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Carl","2011-01-10T20:40:06.157Z","AT-AT Walker","This is a fantastic set, and although it has 253 less pieces than the 2003 version, I think that it is better. It's smaller size means that it is easier to display and it's more stable build means that it is easier to play with.<div><br></div><h4>Minifigures</h4><div><br></div><div>The two Snowtroopers are rare minifigures (unless you got loads of Snowtrooper battle packs) and while the General Veers minifigure doesn't have anything that unique about him, it's still good to have an Imperial Hoth commander for playability purposes. The new Han Solo is nothing too special, but it's nice to have another version of him all the same. The Rebel Trooper is an awesome minifigure just like the Rebel Troopers in the Hoth Rebel Battle pack and Luke is a nice addition as well. But WHAT ON EARTH/HOTH IS C3-P0 DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLEFIELD? He's still nice though as there is a new Echo Base coming out this year and if that doesn't include him then I can just take him from here. Finally, the AT-AT Pilot is another awesome minifigure and a welcome addition to my Hoth forces.</div><div><br></div><h4>Turret</h4><div><br></div><div>I pity the Rebels. I mean, what good is turret no bigger than the foot of an AT-AT really going to do to said AT-AT? But it is still a cool addition to the set and gives something for the Rebel Trooper to do besides getting crushed.</div><div><br></div><h4>AT-AT Walker</h4><div><br></div><div>The AT-AT has always been one of my favourite Star Wars vehicles, and LEGO has done a very good job replicating it for the third time. The build is sturdier than the 2003 version in my opinion, and lends itself to more dynamic playability. While building the legs gets repetitive almost to the point of annoyance, what else can you expect from a&nbsp;quadruped vehicle?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The head is a vast improvement on the flimsy one from the 2003 version, and instead of the side walls wobbling all over the place they hold their proper shape quite nicely. One slight downside is that it can only fit one minifigure, and they cannot be stuck in in a way that allows no moving about without modifying the interior.</div><div><br></div><div>The body is sturdy and there are no problems with it other than the lack of a speeder bike area like that of the 2003 version. This however is a very minor problem and although there is nowhere to put it inside the walker, you can still get the speeder from a Snowtrooper Battle Pack and put it with the walker.</div><div><br></div><h4>Price</h4><div><br></div><div>I can't really comment on the price, as I got this set as a birthday present yesterday.</div><div><br></div><h4>Overall</h4><div><br></div><div>Overall this set is fantastic, and is certainly one of the best sets of 2010.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>&hellip;Box Design is very good, it shows everything you get in the box, it also shows you pictures of Palpatine's Shuttle (8096), Boba Fett's Slave 1 (8097) and a Clone Turbo Tank (8098).</p>
<p>Instructions are very good as well, very easy to read over and follow.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&hellip;This set has many parts that everyone has wanted for like years, for example this set has a new 1x3 plate which has never been seen before I dont think and a lot of light grey bricks so you can build up your collection of Light Grey bricks.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>&hellip;This set comes with 8 minifigures, Luke Skywalker (Pilot with new Torso, Helmet, Face and new Chrome lightsabre), Han Solo (New Face and torso again with blaster), General Veers (Not that new), an AT-AT pilot (never had one before so not sure if it is any different), C3PO (New Gold version), a Hoth Rebel (Very nice new minifigure with blaster) and 2 Snowtroopers both with blasters&nbsp;(my first.....YAY!)</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>&hellip; The build is not very challenging at all but it takes time before it all comes together, the legs are all built in the same way (you can build 2 at a time as the instructions show X2 next to the legs.&nbsp; Once you have all four legs done the build gets quicker.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>&hellip; This model is AMAZING!&nbsp; It looks so like the actual AT-AT from The Empire Strikes Back/Return of the Jedi.&nbsp; You can move the legs like on an action figure and the head turns from side to side as well. The Satellite dish that comes with the set swivels 360 degrees.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>&hellip;Overall this set is a brilliant addition to anyone's LEGO Star Wars collection by far.&nbsp; The minifigures were well chosen and the size compared to the minifigures is immense.&nbsp; I love this set basically because I have always wanted one of these beasties since the 2003 one came out and I am so glad I found this one with &pound;10 off the RRP (&pound;89.99)</p>

"zipsforbananas","2012-07-28T12:10:12.75Z","The mighty AT-AT, Hoth just wouldn't be the same without it!","<p>This fantastic set will be the daddy of many collections! It's the smallest AT-AT yet, but is still huge, and significantly it fits with the 2009 style update - it practically looks related to the AT-ST in 8038! It's not the cheapest, but it's better value than most of the bigger sets, and it has a good selection of minifigures that would rival most of them.</p><p>The set is of course all about the&nbsp;<b>AT-AT</b> itself, and it doesn't disappoint. It is imposingly tall, and looks threatening. Of course, it is smaller than previous versions, but the scaling looks good, even though it is far too small for true minifigure scale (which set isn't?). 2009 seemed to start a new wave of more realistically scaled vehicles, and this AT-AT really benefits from being smaller - it looks more compact and all the panels look more like they belong to the overall unit. In terms of film likeness it is spot on, and the ways in which all the panels are joined on to the Technic frame, particularly in the head (again, like the AT-ST of 8038) are great.</p><p>Unfortunately it has to be said that for an indestructible juggernaut it is unusually flimsy! The head does come off too easily, but then a more stable attachment would limit the flexibility of the neck, which is delightfully made with alternating 2x2 and 4x4 round plates. It's wuite difficult to pick up too, it's easy to knock the underbody pieces off. But the main problem is the panels on the legs that fall off every time you try to bend them. This all comes from the newer compact designing; again they could be more firmly attached but the set would soon become bulky (okay, an AT-AT should be bulky, maybe clumsy would be a better word!) so as a collector who only wants to pose and display them it is annoying but I can live with it. If you bought it for a child to play with though I imagine it would be an absolute nightmare.</p><p>The interiors are fairly good. The head is nicely shaped for the pilot to fit in, although I'm a little disappointed he hasn't got a console of some kind. And yes, there should be room for two and for General Veers to stand up in but come on! How big do you want the set to be! I think it's fantastically judged for the smaller scale. The main compartment seems a little odd in that it comes out, and the screens you expected in the cockpit are here in an odd little console, but as a way to sit the troops in and keep them accessible it works well.</p><p>The Rebel's <b>Radar Dish Gun</b> is quite fun and is much better than the last incarnation (with the dodgy 2004 snowspeeder). What you see is what you get, but what you see is good! And you can get the trooper to hold the handle, you just have to tilt it so it's only half gripping the bar - you can always use the spare to make it two-handled too. It boosts the Rebel defenc effort nicely and looks good next to the Echo Base bunker and turret gun.</p><p>And the <b>figures</b> that come with it aren't&nbsp;phenomenal, but they are all good, and all 8 make this an instantly playable set. C-3PO is standard enough, but isn't actually in as many sets as I thought, so as much as he's a little out of place (unless you build a rebel base for him to run round panicking!) it's nice to have him. Han is also not all that fitting for the battlefield, but would go nicely in that interior scene. Luke is fantastic, it's no wonder that Lego didn't see the need to update him for the 2012 X-Wing. I'm not sure why the white vest seems to have gone a little see-through for the new pilot torso, but I'm happy to put up with that for the back printing and better detailing. His face is nicely aggressive, and his helmet is really excellent. Plus, the whip to stick him to the AT-AT is really fun - he's gonna take it down single handed!</p><p>The rebel trooper is by far the best outside of the battle packs, nicely detailed and printed, decent colour legs and a far better hat than the old troopers got; but he's only a trooper so he's never going to make figure of the year is he! The snowtroopers are good, but much the same as every snowtrooper ever, I think the colour of the hips is the only variety we've ever seen in these! General Veers is great to have, with nice back printed body armour, although I'm not all that convinced of the likeness in the face! And the best figure of the set is the AT-AT driver. His body printing is excellent and his helmet is terrific. It's the same mould as the newer TIE pilot, but in white and with all the printing is looks really great.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Brilliant compact styling</li><li>Clever construction with panels</li><li>Great likeness to the film; it looks brilliant!</li><li>Good radar dish gun, small but nice to have</li><li>Great set of figures; the AT-AT pilot and Luke are the highlights</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>

<p>What a beast!! The daddy of the Imperial ground assault is here, and he's great! The problems with pieces falling off is a very serious flaw, but the new styling is excellent, and as a full scene play-set it works really well.

"Nuruodo","2015-10-27T06:51:28.79Z","Imperial walker incoming!","<p>The AT-AT is one of the most iconic&nbsp;Star Wars sets. Scary, powerful, tall, covered by tons of metal: it&#39;s the biggest Imperial weapon on ground. I needed to get a Lego version, and some year ago I bought it. Although I paid it more than 100&euro;, I&#39;ve to say that it&#39;s impressive.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>The box was huge, it couldn&#39;t catch your eyes, both for the image and the dimensions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It&#39;s made (as you can see) basically by light and dark grey parts. Some Technics sticks are used in the legs, while big flat pieces compose the main &quot;body&quot;. For feet are used nice parts as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are the same of common Hoth sets: Han, that hasn&#39;t snow wearing (strange fact); Luke with pilot uniform;&nbsp;C-3PO; a Rebel soldier, identical to the ones of that year Hoth sets; an AT-AT pilot, that you can find only in AT-ATs; an Imperial officer, maybe General Veers; two Snowtroopers. Minifigures are a lot and they include main characters of the original trilogy.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I enjoyed the build, although I&#39;ve to say that the legs were boring (as they usually are, and as wings usually are too): you&#39;ve to build four times the same one. However, building the &quot;body&quot; and mostly the &quot;head&quot; is very enjoyable. I&#39;ve to say that legs feet are really nice and accurate.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Yeah, the completed model is just as you can imagine: impressive. &quot;Head&quot; can move, and I&#39;ve to say that the junction between it and the &quot;body&quot; is very resistant, because in many years it never broke away. Legs can move as well, but you&#39;ve to move all them to maintain it with some bent paw to make it not fall. The &quot;body&quot; is very spacious, it can host all the troopers and if you want you can add more of them.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Was it worth the price? Yes, I think it was. Is it enjoyable as you can aspect? Maybe not. Unfortunately it&#39;s very static, but however I don&#39;t mind&nbsp;it. You&#39;ll have fun with Rebels escaping before it and with Imperial minifigures, and don&#39;t forget the turret: it&#39;s just as in the movies. By the way, regaurding&nbsp;fidelity to the original: it surely gives you the impression that is identical to&nbsp;<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>, but however some details are missing. I don&#39;t like, for example, the shovels used in the turrets.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Impressive, huge dimensions</p>

<p>&ndash; Lots of minifigures, including heroes from original trilogy</p>

<p>&ndash; Spacious &quot;body&quot;</p>

<p>&ndash; Pretty close to the original model</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Some detail are missing or are inaccurate</p>

<p>&ndash; Very expensive, with bad price-for-piece rate</p>

<p>&ndash; The build of legs is boring</p>
