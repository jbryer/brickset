I just picked up a whole set at TRU, and they were a blast to build! They come with just enough parts so it's not too boring, but it's still exciting to build. Almost every minifig contains a new part, so what's not to love?",FALSE,5,5,5,5,3
"pod120","2010-08-05T02:45:57.89Z","Is This Progress?","<p>When I first heard of a Lego series of minifigures I did not at all consider getting any. What's the point of a minifigure without a set to put it in? Once I had collected three, I discovered these minifigures&nbsp;had new faces, complex printings, new pieces and a lower quality plastic. Despite the positives and negatives, I found that the best thing about the minifigs was the adventure of trying to find them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that Lego were not at all hesitant to use new ideas of colour, detail and pieces to make these minifigures more characterised. Certain minifigs in this series are wanted specifically for their new elements. It has occured that Lego used China to manufacture these minifigures at a cheaper cost with a lower quality plastic. This was probably to compensate for the broad range of new ideas, which are essential in order to sell minifigures individually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigures are listed in the order that I got them and have a rating out of five.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>***** = Excessively Interesting</strong> (stands out next to the others)</p>
<p><strong>****&nbsp;&nbsp;= Good Detail</strong> (I love it, but not everyone does)</p>
<p><strong>***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= Average</strong> (good, but there are better ones)</p>
<p><strong>**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= Lacking</strong> (I think I've got that in another set)</p>
<p><strong>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= Poor</strong> (how did they allow this?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rating is partially based in comparison to the other minifigures in this series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Forestman: ***</strong></p>
<p>A fair minifig and a pleasant surprise for the first one. He has a good range of accessories including bow, arrows, hat and feather. I am unsure if the hat is new, but it is certainly a piece I&nbsp;have never seen before. As for the feather, I am sure that is a new piece. The interest of this minifigure may be lowered because the bow and arrows are already included with another minifigure. It is obvious that this minifig was inspired by Robin Hood. It is also obvious that Lego didn't purchase rights to the name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zombie: ***</strong></p>
<p>This minifig exceeds in detail but not in colours. I guess that's just part of his character. You can't have a bright-coloured Zombie. The accessories greatly raise the interest of this minifigure. Although they have been seen before, I believe both of them are different to their previous shape. The shovel has a flat end and the chicken leg has been extended to allow it to be held in the ideal position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Magician: ***</strong></p>
<p>I believe this is the only minifigure that cannot hold and wear all of their accessories simultaneously. This&nbsp;is because the Magician includes both a hair piece and a top hat, and as many Lego people know, they cannot be worn at the same time. The wand is the main element of this minifig that gives it attention. I'm sure&nbsp;this piece is new&nbsp;and I believe&nbsp;it is also&nbsp;used for the Astronaut's laser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Indian: ****</strong></p>
<p>I rather like this minifig and think it&nbsp;has a good range of accessories. I am unsure if the hat is new, but even if it already exists I don't think&nbsp;it has been used to hold the twin feathers before. The interst of this minifig may be lowered because of its close similarities to the Forestman. Both contain a bow, arrows and a hat with a feather of some sort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Astronaut: *****</strong></p>
<p>This is my favourite minifigure in series one and I am not sure why. It does not have the most amazing colours or detail in the collection, but does have metallic parts and two new pieces. Many people seek this minifig for its unique laser. This minifigure is very much like ones seen in&nbsp;from SP3. Also like SP3, he could have come with an oxygen tank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cheerleader: ***</strong></p>
<p>This minifig receives attention because of its new pom pom pieces. Not only do they have a complex shape, but are also multicoloured. To add to it, this minifig comes with two. Although the pom poms are rather interesting, the minifigure itself is not so much. The detail is good, but colours aren't all that great. This minifigure is one of two definite female minifigures in series one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nurse: **</strong></p>
<p>Although this minifigure includes what I believe is two new pieces, the character really isn't anything that hasn't been seen before. The theme of this minifig is just another one of those emergency rescue themes which Lego City have overused. I didn't even notice this minifig had two new pieces until I saw it built. Despite all, you've gotta love that syringe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wrestler: ****</strong></p>
<p>This was the last minifigure I got before using barcode reference. I like this minifig for its use of colours and detail. There is good balance with this minifig, as it has lots of colour, fair detail, but still looks like a wrestler. Although this minifig does not have any new pieces, it is the only minifgure in series one&nbsp;with a cape or cloth piece of some sort. I should say I was rather pleased to get this one.&nbsp;Compliments to Jog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dummy: **</strong></p>
<p>Some how I think the name reflects the person who designed this minifig. Personally, it is my least-favourite and that is because it lacks in most areas. Of all the minifigures it has the least colour and the least detail, there is too much yellow in the world of Lego. It also does not have any new pieces or any that are all that interesting. The only reason I did not rate this minifig <strong>*</strong> is because the thought was there. The ideas person should be praised and the designer should be sacked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clown: *****</strong></p>
<p>This is the ideal minifigure. Not only does it excel in both detail and colours, but it also includes two new pieces of reasonable complexity. It looks is realistic, which is caused by the attention to detail. Printing can be found in multiple colours on the torso and legs,&nbsp;the legs&nbsp;being a different colour to each other. Whether your a child, a collector or the drunk guy at the end of the street, this minifig will most likely satisfy you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Caveman: ***</strong></p>
<p>A minifig saved by its pieces. Although this minifig is a new idea, I don't think it was all that successful. The hair piece is intersting, but similar to an existing piece. As for the club, it&nbsp;is an existing piece&nbsp;shrunk to the required scale. The detail is not bad, but the colour is heading towards how I described the Dummy. The yellow and tan do not go well together like they do on the Indian, which adds blue to the combination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ninja: ***</strong></p>
<p>I must say this is a good minifig, its just let down by the simple fact that there is nothing new about it. The sword is slightly metallic which is interesting, but it is still an existing piece which&nbsp;Lego collectors&nbsp;have seen before. Unfortunately the sword cannot be placed in the clip behind the hood without looking goofy or touching the ground. I guess the face is something new though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Diver: ***</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that this minifigure is great. The scuba equipment shows detail and is interesting for its complex and translucent pieces. Even though it has scuba equipment, there still isn't any new pieces. I have heard rumours that this minifig is the most disliked among collectors. I have also heard rumours that this is the most common minifigure in the series and therefore the easiest to get. This could be possible, as I have seen it as the display promotion in more than one store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Robot: *****</strong></p>
<p>This minifigure is excellent. When I first saw a picture of it I knew it would be in high demand, but when I saw it built I couldn't rate it less than <strong>*****</strong> in a review. The reason for this is that it shows limitless detail, both in the printings&nbsp;and three-dimensional design of the robotic helmet, which is obviously a new piece. Even though this minifigure is mostly grey, it still does well colour-wise because of its metallic pieces, such as the helmet and face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Skater: ***</strong></p>
<p>There really isn't much to this minifigure at all. It's just a normal person with a new hair piece. There is nothing&nbsp;about it&nbsp;that makes you want to get it. However, when the skateboard is added the minifig becomes more interesting. There will be people who seek this minifig just for the skateboard. Without the skateboard, I probably would have rated this minifig second-worst after the Dummy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cowboy: **</strong></p>
<p>Somehow I think the idea of this minifigure could be described as ""cheap"". It seems as though this was an obvious idea for a Lego minifig which could be created out of existing pieces. The designer probably thought, some little kid will buy the minifigures until they get this one because it has a gun. I can see the facial expression be that of the designer, smug because of their business scheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, I think these minifigures are more a success than a failure. They certainly sold well and I found that I liked them more once I had taken a closer look at them. If you are unsure, I would suggest buying one or two of the current series before they disappear. You won't be wasting any money. Just be sure to remember they are made of a lower quality plastic, which is probably the biggest let down about the figures. If you do wish to get them all, I would highly suggest using barcode reference, as it worked everytime for me.</p>

"Firox_5000","2010-10-04T14:51:07.063Z","Finally individual lego figures","<p>After all these years waiting lego has finally listened to customer demand by giving us these fantastic minifigures. there are 16 figs you can get in a plastic bag but the twist is, you dont know which one you will get in each pack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some figures are better and worse than others so here's my thoughts on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cowboy</strong></p>
<p>A good return to the old cowboys sets, this figure may not have many unique pieces but is a very good figure 7/10,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nurse</strong></p>
<p>A nice one to build the female collection with and one who can boost the lego city hospital staff and crew, 6/10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zombie</strong></p>
<p>errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, Really good&nbsp; figure slightly odd acceseries but is a nice figure 7/10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Diver</strong></p>
<p>Quite a nice little diver but nothing special exacly but has a nice design. 6/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wrestler</strong>Pehaps the worse figure, despite resembling a decent super hero , he has no acceseries unlike the others and is not terribly durable 3/10,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Forestman</strong></p>
<p>Neat design that is one of the best series 1 figures I think. 8/10,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Robot</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the best figure in this series , near pieces and a nice metalic colour,9/10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>skate border</strong></p>
<p>Quite nice figure with board 6/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Test dummy</strong></p>
<p>Cool,unique and rare, he is pretty good for a garage , 7/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Indian</strong></p>
<p>Goes well with the cowboy figure and has nice head piece 7/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ninja</strong></p>
<p>a&nbsp;great welcomed return he is a must have in oyur collection 8/10,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Magician</strong></p>
<p>Really amazing figure now you see him now you dont, 8/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cheerleader</strong></p>
<p>One of the best female figures so far, 9/10 ,those pom poms are amazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Caveman</strong></p>
<p>A great unique and good figure but his mallet should be a bit bigger really. 7/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clown</strong></p>
<p>A bright fun figure who is an ice touch 7/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Spaceman</strong></p>
<p>The return of the classic space men , with some neat new pieces. 8/10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall on good and bad I would say it stands as 50/50 roughly one half is good and the other half is bad. try and makesure you try and find the good half. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figs are great but being in individual bags where you dont see the figure&nbsp;you want is bad. You may buy 20 at a time and find half of them are duplicate. So be warned!</p>

<p>I own all 16 now, albeit with duplicates of the Zombie, Diver, Ninja, Forest Man, Robot....I finally managed to locate the final figures I needed-Cheerleader, Magician, Skateboarder via using the barcode crib sheets Lego fans put online...Thanks for that.</p>
<p>The most common figures in the UK seem to be the Zombie and Robot, I got so many I ended up giving one of each Zombie and Robot to my best friend as a small gift...</p>

<p>I do like the concept-sort of Lego Kinder Surprise toy...but the fun leaves when you feel like you've wasted 1.95GBP and end up with duplicates, even if you have the barcode cheats you need to look extremely carefully to match it up and get the figure you want....</p>

"jatonaz","2011-02-26T14:04:59.483Z","Definitely worth picking up a complete set!","<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having bought a whole box (60 bags) of each series so far, and seeing&nbsp;how so many of my friend who were not&nbsp;into Lego&nbsp;get interested in these little minifigs,&nbsp;I thought I'd share my view on each series as a whole. To the hardcore AFOL, there is not much that needs to be said about the CM trend, as you are sure to have your own opinion. For those casual collectors/beginners, however, I hope this review can provide some insight on each series and the craze as a whole. I'll do these CM reviews using several criterias I find critical when grading minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New parts in Series One (as of time of release) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pom-Pom 
<li>Caveman club 
<li>Caveman&nbsp;hairpiece 
<li>Clown hairpiece 
<li>Trumpet 
<li>PA7 70 license plate 
<li>Magician's wand 
<li>Plume (more precisely, a comeback) 
<li>Robot buckethead 
<li>Syringe 
<li>Medical Records</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some seemingly ""recycled"" parts (just a theory that some friends and I have, that TLG uses the series to clear out some overproduced parts. You can also simply file them under ""common"" if you're not&nbsp;into conspiracy.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue lightsaber 
<li>Wrench 
<li>Bow+Arrow 
<li>Ninja hood 
<li>Katana 
<li>Pistols 
<li>Shovel 
<li>Turkey 
<li>Orange flippers</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall a good mix of old and new elements, all pretty useful. Almost all of the heads/bodies/torsos are unique. None of them feature double-sided printing, but a good amount of them have printed torsos. Not going to judge how pretty they look, the whole point of collecting/releasing 16 minifigs is to reach out to all possible collectors, so you decide yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Original/MOC Usability:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closely related to the ""Parts"" catagory is&nbsp;usability.&nbsp;""Original""&nbsp;means usefulness of&nbsp;the figure unchanged (maybe except face) in your collection. ""MOC"" means the usefulness of the figure taken apart and elements used to your liking. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A City collector can obviously&nbsp;find great use for the Cheerleader, especially in groups. The Skateboarder goes well as the punk kid on the block of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7641-1"">7641</a> and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8403-1"">8403</a>. The Clown can add some spice to your <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=10196-1"">Carousel</a> Carnival, as well as the Magician. They can also set up booth on the streets of your <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Town&amp;subtheme=Modular Houses"">modular Town buildings</a>. Although lacking in sets, the Nurse obviously goes with the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=City&amp;subtheme=Emergency"">ER</a> subtheme. The Diver's color scheme is a bit different from the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/browse/?theme=Town&amp;subtheme=Divers"">old sets</a>, but it surely adds variety to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historic themes-wise, the Forestman, Indian, Cowboy&nbsp;and Ninja obviously go along great with their own series. However, because of the design, this Forestman looks more like a leader than your <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/browse/?theme=Castle&amp;subtheme=Forestmen"">good old forestmen</a>. The Indian's smiley face is different compared to the seriousness of&nbsp;its <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/browse/?theme=Western&amp;subtheme=Indians"">comrades</a>, a shortcoming that the Ninja and Cowboy&nbsp;don't have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spaceman would go well with <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=Space Police 3"">Space Police 3 series</a>, as a different faction of the good guys or as the Supreme Commander. The Robot and Zombie will both be useful in your Sci-Fi/Horror MOC (in swarms), however they do not look like they are useful in any existing theme/set (Studios, maybe?) The Caveman, Crash Test Dummy and Wrestler also fall into that catagory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOC-wise, the hairpiece owned by the Caveman and the Clown are extremely useful and already have popped up in numerous works. The Magician's formal suit is also an useful piece in several themes. The Caveman's club is a great weapon for Orcs in the Fantasy Castle line. Other than these accessories, I find the minifigs too themed-specific to have parts useful for all types of MOCing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Swarmers/Standouts/Fillers:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Series 1,&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;2 and 3, actually features no minifig that immediately&nbsp;caused&nbsp;""OMG MUST HAVE 459 of these"" from the Lego community (as far as I was&nbsp;aware.) That being said, there are several figures worth getting multiples of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best ""swarmers"" in this series include the Cheerleader, Indian, Ninja, Forestman, Robot, and Zombie. The Cheerleader and Zombie&nbsp;obvious only work in packs. The rest are all&nbsp;good soldiers for whatever theme they are appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although really&nbsp;unorthodox and having little play value&nbsp;for a&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;minifig, the Wrestler actually&nbsp;looks real good&nbsp;on display. He is definitely a worthy figure to get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fillers in this set include the Crash Test Dummy (by&nbsp;universal consent), the Diver, and the Magician. Although they are of some use individually, their design and inspiration where simply not on par with the rest of the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it goes without saying that the CMs are a good investment, whether or not you plan to resell them. Series 1 minifigs were much harder to acquire initially than the other series released so far, and being No.1 and therefore the oldest set that started it all, they will hold some sentimental and ""cultural"" value. I also think out of the five series I've seen so far this series has the most diverse collection of minifigures. To those who haven't gotten the whole set I seriously think you should; IMO this one has the most value as a whole than the other series.</p>",TRUE,5,4,1,4,5

<p>-Since&nbsp;the minifigures is designed&nbsp;to be collected and traded, You may get duplicates. But the fun thing about this is that you can make deals with your friends to trade, how fun is that?</p>
<p>-AFOLs around the world are always targeting the minifigures and they may leak the cheat sheets for the minifiures in the internet. Be on the lookout for these ""Jackpot"" sheets that may lead you to the minifigures you want because these minifigs has their own exclusive accesories.</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p>-You may get duplicates and if you don't have friends who collect LEGO's then you've got a problem.</p>
<p>-Act fast because these minifigs have a limited release time. After 2 months the series will be discontinued for 1 month before a new series comes out, so its a race against time.</p>
