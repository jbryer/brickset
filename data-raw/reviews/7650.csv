Muaka and Kanera?","This is a decent set, which is better than most Hero Factory, which is BIONICLE's replacement.<br><br><h4>Building</h4>Well, it's got a decent build but there's some issues. Nothing big, just not that interesting.<br><h4>Playability</h4>Problems here. The arms move wierdly and unless you attach them just right they won't move at all. The legs are good, but there's two parts sticking out that make the legs unable to go together. The legs have good articulation, but there's still more. The staff's blades will spin but the staff shakes, both reducing the spin and making it seem flimsy. For a weapon it is undersized, the Tridax Pod could do better being partially transparent, and it's too flimsy.<br><h4>Value for Money</h4>Dunno, it's 20 bucks. Better than Hero Factory, so if you're a TECHNIC Action Figure theme fan then buy it. If you want some of the nostalgia (though I doubt you'll get any from this theme) of BIONICLE, then it might be worth it. Parts, maybe. Otherwise, I wouldn't really recommend him.<br><br><h4>Overall</h4><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Large Titan, better than any other HF guy</li><li>A bunch of new parts, nice Black-Blue parts</li><li>Good leg articulation</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Arms are really annoying</li><li>Arms look weaker<br>Hands are odd</li><li>Staff shakes when spun</li><li>The colors of the staff's orb look good for a while but get old quickly<br>Not as good as Brutaka, Kardas, Muaka and Kanera, Maxilos, Takanuva (huge) and other titans.

"KodakKid365","2010-09-02T11:18:43.257Z","Great set!","Von Nebula is a great set! You should get him before anything else.He can step on the heros (because they are tiny.) and even be able to pwn the bad guys. Very good price. I thought he would be at least 30 dollars. He is the biggest set (not counting vehicles) and has an awesome weapon. You can just suck everyone you are fighting up. Probably, the only con is the legs. In the picture on the box his legs are bent. They don't bend. remember that. But don't get me wrong,it's an awesome set.",FALSE,4,4,4,4,5
"NickBrick","2011-05-12T11:51:07.113Z","Wow...","Sorry its taken like forever to write this. Von Nebula...The mastermind...Von Ness. I really am kind of sad that I didn't pay much attention to Hero factory after I bought two of the sets. But when 2.0 came out, I became obsessed with HF.&nbsp; I wanted a titan, but I didn't like Fire Lord very much. So I bought an older titan. And I'm glad I did. Von Nebula is...amazing!<br>POSEABILITY: The arms aren't double jointed. Which is a little disappointing. But surprisingly enough, you can still get Von Nebula into some very awesome poses<br>PLAYABILITY: Terrific! if you have a hero, make em fight!<br>WEAPON AND HELMET: The weapon is not very interesting. Its a pole with a recolored tridax pod with some solek blades. The helmet( or mask) is black version of Hydraxon's. And since Hydraxon has one of my favorite masks, I love it!<br>PARTS: Von Nebula has some very good parts. He has black and blue versions of Xplode's spikes. As well as two black claws. Awesome!<br>OVERALL: Von Nebula is awesome. And is even better than Rotor. Get him if you can.<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"Mandalorian","2010-10-24T14:13:10.913Z","Just plain awesome","Here he is, Von Nebula, the coolest Hero Factory villain so far. I was surprised to find so many great pieces in the box for such a good price. Then came the building. It is a great, slightly complex build, and the figure itself is amazing. Amazing. First of all, there's the super cool Hydraxon mask in black. Then there's the awesome shoulder spikes, the claws, one of which is holding the black hole staff. Another cool thing is that his other hand is free, which doesn't happen a lot these days.

"Colonel14","2011-01-15T23:01:17.857Z","The Evil and Amazing Von Nebula","<p>I got <strong>Von Nebula</strong> for Christmas recently, and I must say, he's one of my all-time favorites. Since my old Bionicle Maxilos is spare parts, Nebula now towers over my other Bionicle/Hero Factory models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Build</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build is like that of the old big Bionicle sets (such as Maxilos). The best feature about Bionicle/Hero Factory sets is becuase they are very sturdy, haivng little to no problems standing up. The arms are simple, lacking the detail the legs have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Parts</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few parts worth mentioning. There's the shoulder pices that are like X-Plodes, except Von's is black with blue tips. A blue and black orb made of two pieces is from what I've seen, unique to this set. There are two pincers used for the face mask, and the peces covering the back are uncommon. The chest piece for Nebula is interesting: it is an old Bionicle foot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Playability</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plenty of playability. Soon after my completion of Nebula, I had a tendancy of carrying him around everywhere I go. He's already been on one road trip. Anyways, being easily poseable and with plenty of bendable parts, Nebula has great playability. He also has a villanous presence: probably from the red eyes and the pincers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend this set. Twenty bucks for this guy? Deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Pros and Cons</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every set has 'em.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros.</p>
<p>- Nice 'n sturdy</p>
<p>- Great playablity</p>
<p>- Good build</p>
<p>- Nice parts selection</p>
<p>- Cheap price for a big model</p>
<p>- One of the better Hero Factory models</p>
<p>Cons.</p>
<p>- Pieces covering the back and the head are a little wobbly</p>
<p>- The staff looks like it's just attached to the hand</p>
<p>- Arms lack detail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Overall</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not the best, but almost. Nebula can almost grasp it. Final verdict: 4/5 stars. Get it whenever possible.</p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>

"TSK15","2016-10-07T03:14:33.42Z","Awesome Epic Von Nebula!!!!!","<p><br />
Box/Instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;Box Is over all good usual square&nbsp;&nbsp;of course shows von nebula on the front. Decent size box,the&nbsp;instructions&nbsp;are easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts Alot of Nice pieces,&nbsp;some of the pieces are not like later hero factory, They are breakable.&nbsp;If you take them off to many times they will snap. The ball on his staff is my favorite part of him. His&nbsp;armor piece right above his head is the&nbsp;bohrok&nbsp;mask in black.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build I am not a fan of builds. I just want to play with whatever I am building. But this build is unique, it is an awesome build so much that could make a unexperienced&nbsp;builder a good builder.</p>

<p>The completed model The complete model is good spinning staff great legs.</p>

<p>Overall opinion Over all opinion great.</p>

"dubiousfreesamples","2019-12-13T10:58:27.27Z","Something of a mixed bag, but overall very imposing","<p>Hero Factory tends to get a really bad rap, and I can certainly see why. The hero sets were subpar, the villain sets felt patchy in terms of quality, and of course, it had the success of Bionicle to live up to. Despite all this, I found all the villain sets to be good in their own way, and Von Nebula is no exception. The build is nowhere near perfect. The position of supports for his legs and arms kind of overlap, reducing posability for both. His thigh-guards move around, sometimes getting in the way of his knees moving. There are massive gaps&nbsp;in his chest, arms and back, there are exposed pins and axles everywhere, and he doesn&#39;t even have elbows. However, the build is quite interesting and I can&#39;t help but like the finished product, despite it&#39;s apparent flaws. The colour scheme is quite uniform for the most part, and the solid black around the wider frame is quite imposing compared to your average constraction figure, despite his relatively short stature. The figure definitely has a certain look to it, and it&#39;s immediately recognisable as a villain. In my opinion, he&#39;s a worthwhile addition to any collection, but keep in mind the amount of flaws the figure has if you do consider picking him up. It limits his play potential for sure, and may mean that it&#39;s a bit of an eyesore at a close level, but he looks great on a shelf.</p>
