<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some neat parts; I like the spines.</li>
<li>Fairly vicious-looking.</li>
<li>Classic BIOICLE red is prevalent.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not terribly exciting.</li>

"deadtree103","2010-08-06T19:08:41.613Z","A very good set wich some people might still be unsure about.","<p>I'll make this quick, I ordered this along with Rotor, William Furno, and Mark Surge, he really looks good with Rotor. He looks suitably sinister for what he is, and he really looks like a crime boss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>*Good peices.</p>
<p>*Recolored Thornak launcher.</p>
<p>*Krika leg in another color.</p>
<p>*Cool-looking and sinister mask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>*Arms can sometimes be awkward to pose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is a really good set, for peices, Playability, display, and posability.</p>

"diehardlegofan","2010-09-23T14:46:59.337Z","Charming, but poor in value","I hear, that with these ""Hero Factory"" sets, you either love 'em or you hate 'em.&nbsp; I used to love them, but that was back when I had high anticipation for the sets to come out.&nbsp; When I liked them, I was comparing them to Bionicle sets, and when I did that I liked them, because I like Bionicle.&nbsp; Then I tried seeing them as it's own theme.&nbsp; Now I find that it is a get rich fast scheme.&nbsp; I will get on to this set.&nbsp; The set itself is basically a naked robot with a few gigantic armor pieces, except the armor on the bottom of his legs, which is very poor.&nbsp; This has Glatorian fists and Glatorian skulls.&nbsp; I think that for this new theme they should have come up with, at least new skulls.&nbsp; Other than those ""recycled"" pieces, the pieces that were made especially for this set kind of disappoint me.&nbsp; The mask, I will say is very cool, and I'll let that one slip by.&nbsp; However, the shoulder and back armor pieces are a little much for me.&nbsp; The spear that XPlode is holding is a new piece, and I don't really like it.&nbsp; As you may see in the picture of this set, there are many things that they photo-shopped.&nbsp; Such as: the head is moved down lower (it is impossible to do that with the actual set), the spear handle is going straight through his fist (impossible), and the shoulder pad on his right arm is tilted to the front of the arm (impossible), and, of course, everything is much more shiny.&nbsp; If LEGO has to do that to the picture of the set to make you want to buy it, then that shows that they didn't put as much effort into the set as they should have.&nbsp; I do NOT recommend this set.&nbsp; Hero Factory needs to step up its game or go away. <br>",TRUE,3,1,3,3,2

"KodakKid365","2011-01-03T12:23:52.45Z","Much cooler in pictures.","Xplode would be one of the best sets if his armor wasn't messed up. His arm armor. It looks great in pictures but it's not. An the colors would be perfect if part of him wasn't bright red instead of all dark red and black.",FALSE,3,3,3,3,3
"Mandalorian","2011-02-16T14:11:45.167Z","Extraordinary amount of character","<p>Xplode is probably the best canister-sized villain so far. His build is quick but fun, he has some great parts and his playability is the best of all HF sets so far. After you build him, his looks are stunning. The helmet, spikes, overall hunched look and ax/sword make for a real gangster. A person who knows nothing about HF would definately know he's a bad guy. Those teeth are magnificent! And actually, he looks better as a set than on pictures.</p><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>1. Extaordinary amount of character</li><li>2. Great pieces</li><li>3. Best playability of all HF sets</li><li>4. Good as a play or display set</li><li>5. Launcher fires far</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>NOTHING!</li></ul><br>Okay, lets get straight to the point. You must have him.

"Matroxide","2012-08-02T21:28:23.523Z","Not Impressed","Once Hero Factory came out,&nbsp;I had high expectations. Unfortunatly, they did not do as well as&nbsp;I had hoped. Firstly, the plastic was cheap compared to there predecessor, Bionicle. Also the plot went by to fast and was dificult to play for a long time with Xplode or any Hero Factory personel. I was depressed with the cheap parts used and I could not believe that Bionicle had ended in part on the behalf of it.&nbsp;In all, I was not impressed.",FALSE,2,3,3,3,1
"Malurus","2012-08-14T13:35:15.17Z","Yeah, right... well...","<p>I wanted this set at first, but then, I mourned over Bionicle's demise. It had cheap plastic, a terrible plot, a short build, and those are some of it's good qualities. It's build wasn't half as long as&nbsp;I expected, since they use such large pieces. Yeah, I know some people like it, but it's plots kind of like Lego City. It's everywhere, not specifically in one place , aresting people here and there&nbsp;and then it is over, demoting playability. Unless&nbsp;a miracle happens to HF, I',m going to give it a thmbs down.</p>",TRUE,3,1,3,2,2
