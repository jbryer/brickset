His mask is amazing, the new claw design is cool, and the toxic tanks are wonderful!<br><br>If you're thinking about buying this set, I would suggest that you get it with one of the Heros, as it will be utterly useless without somebody to battle him. That being said, if played with with another hero, playability is endless.<br><br>My only cons for the set are this:<br><br>1. CHEAP PLASTIC! I like to be able to build and unassemble and rebuild my Bionicles, yet when the plastic breaks/cracks every time I try to do that, that really gets old... especially as I don't have pieces to replace his parts...<br>2. The price of this set is a little bit expensive. $13 is a little too much for a Bionicle this size. It needs longer extensions for its limbs to justify $13 for it.<br><br>Other than those two cons, I would definitely suggest getting this set.

Really awesome figures and good storyline comparable to Bionicle saga. Same Good vs Evil theme and similar ""copy-cat"" design and Bio piece recycling.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hero Factory = Bionicle with a different name!<br><br>&nbsp; One major design flaw is that the line now uses STICKERS much like discontinued Exo-Force mech line. That was biggest problem with E-F sets and who knows maybe it caused the death of E-F? Too many complained about painful sticker attachment job. MeltDown has 12 stickers and quite small I must add. At first I thought that sticker application is not that big of a drawback but it really was quite painful of a task with my chubby adult fingers. Still, if sets are as good as this one, stickers are not a dealbreaker!<br><br>&nbsp;MELTDOWN REVIEW:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; My first set and even better than old Bionicle I have to admit! Many were sad Bio is discontinued but HF franchise will surely be popular among us Bio fans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Short and bulky strong menacing looking Von Nebula's most dangerous Servant, MeltDown is surely a Villain to be reckoned with!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reminds quite a lot Bionicle Barraki Kalmah with his tentacle and forward stretched neck.

"vexorian","2010-11-06T14:08:42.11Z","Nice but stickers are a problem.","Meltdown is my first HF villain, and other than Rotor I don't plan getting the others. HF as a bionicle replacement? It is definitely cooler but it needs severe work in piece/price ratios, stickers aren't nice either.<br><br>I'll begin the review with the end. Meltdown overall is a interesting character, looks cool, evil and has nuclear symbols all around. It is fairy different to all the stuff we have had in Bionicle recently.&nbsp; I think a major victory of HF over Bionicle is the general lack of silver. Silver is in some HF sets, but not in EVERY set. Which leads me to the color scheme, it is pretty nice, and the trans parts just give him that look. Not to mention the cyclops eye. I got to say that internet pictures were giving me the feeling that meltdown was going to be skinny, but that's not the case.<br><br>Parts 5/5 : This is where meltdown wins hands down. Yellow has been very scarce in Bionicle and it is nice to see useful parts in that color. We have the shields (two of them), the interesting blades (4 of them). The trans green tubes and the canisters. There are also a couple of useful utility parts like two triple axle joints and there is one of those things often used in titans' tendons but shorter. Oh, and yellow shin guards. PS:Green tentacle.<br><br>Playability 4/5: Well, I an AFOL that primarily collects and MoCs, so actual playability is hard for me to rate. For a kid the highlight would be the launcher, I guess. Note that this launcher has been in use last year in Bionicle as well and is not really a good reason to get this set specifically. There is also the tentacle. Otherwise, it is as pose-able as you would expect from a 'canister' set, which means it has far more articulations than the heros. Can move the head a little and has mid point articulations in legs and arms. It is not less and not more than what you would expect from a Bionicle or HF set of this size.<br><br>Building Experience 3/5: Was very easy and non-challenging for me, but I am ooold. Anyway, for a kid around 10 years it should be a interesting thing. For a teen around 16 not that much. But there is something worth noting in this are:<br><br>The stickers: I have been learning to stand stickers a little more lately, after all, it turns out that you can wash pieces that have them. I bought this set in full knowledge that it had many stickers, but what I did not notice is that: The stickers are almost impossible to put correctly. It was very unpleasant. There are 10 stickers with odd shapes that you must place in the shield pieces (with odd shapes). It is very hard. I think that most young kids and even tweens might need help from parents to put the stickers correctly. The thing with meltdown is that without the stickers, he would lose 50% of his personality, so I couldn't do what I usually do : not put the stickers altogether.<br><br>Besides of the stickers, it was a simple build. Let us be honest, nobody gets HF/Bionicle sets of this size for the build but for the pieces and the overall look of the character.<br><br>Value for money 3/5: Some things that made me give it this low rating:<br>- The yellow shields and blades are quite clearly of lower quality plastic than usual yellow plastic. It is almost obvious when comparing the leg pieces with them.<br>- Only one Zamor (those ball things that you are supposed to shoot). I bet most kids that actually play with meltdown will eventually lose the only marble they received with this package.<br>- Only one eye piece (Edit: I mean, there is no spare for the eye piece, which is kind of small and the mold is usually spared). Uh that's kind of cheap, LEGO...<br><br>On the good side, the ball joints feel more resistant than usual Bionicle stuff, specially the Ben 10 femur pieces. However, I just bought it today so I do not know for sure how much more resistant they are.<br><br>Overall 4/5: I am being generous because he does look good and evil and that's basically the main purpose of a 'canister' set from HF, plus the pieces are so good that I will try buying an extra one if money allows.&nbsp; I am also glad that canisters are no longer in use for sets of this size, with some luck TLG will stop using them in the small sets as well. Beware about stickers though.",TRUE,4,5,3,4,3

"crazyawesomeyeah","2010-08-29T10:12:48.05Z","Not the best, but okay.","<p>Well, when I first bought this set, I was expecting Meltdown to be a lot more bigger and brighter than I thought he would be. He is a lot more brighter than the box itself, just not as big.</p>

    <li>For one thing, he sure has a lot of new pieces, like the vat of toxic waste.</li>
    <li>New head piece.</li>
    <li>Okay/interesting build.</li>
    <li>His Meteor Blaster is tinted Black.</li>
    <li>Meteor Blaster works very well.</li>
    <li>His little projectile is Dark Green.</li>
    <li>New yellow pieces, like the piece you put the stickers on.</li>
    <li>New Recolored pieces, like the tentacle.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Well, he has a really small head (Body Disproportionate).</li>
    <li>His arms are a little too short.</li>
    <li>Ankle armor is a little wobbly.</li>
    <li>Meteor Blaster isn't securely fixed on.</li>
    <li>The head can't turn/rotate is all directions.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Overall</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Now, I put 3 bricks because I'm a teenager, and i do kinda find building Meltdown a bit dull, especially with the legs.</li>
    <li>For the parts, i set it as that way, cause it's obvious why i did that.</li>
    <li>For playability, i put three bricks, cause I'm a teenager, and I'm sure most of you guys are to, so that's why i set mine like that.</li>
    <li>Lastly, i set 4 bricks for 'Value For Money' like that, because take a look for a second. Prison carriage Rescue is the same 50 Pieces for only $10, and Meltdown has the same number of pieces for $3 dollars more!? Well, i could understand that, cause the pieces are a lot more bigger.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>: in general, this is an average set. If you are looking to try some new theme, try Prison carriage Rescue. If you were a long-term Bionicle fan (like myself), shoot for this; For those Hero Factory fans out there desperately trying to find another villain, try Corroder, or maybe even Thunder.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,4

"Colonel14","2011-01-17T17:23:17.41Z","You'll melt down once you build Metldown!","<p>Shortly after Christmas, I gathered up my cash and headed to Target. My choice of what to buy dwindled down to two sets: Meltdown and Corroder. In the end, it was <strong>Meltdown</strong> that came home with me. Within a few minutes, he and Von Nebula were traveling around the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Build</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The great thing about Bionicle/Hero Factory sets is that they are very sturdy. The build is pretty straightforward until you get to the biggest drawback of this set: the stickers! Stickers in a Bionicle/Hero Factory set!? They are a major pain to apply like most stickers are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like most villains, Meltdown has a sphere launcher. It's a little wobbly, so I remade it so it stayed in place. Connected to both of Meltdown's are cords that connect to toxic containers on his shoulders. The containers are a nice touch, but if Meltdown's arms are positioned by his side, his shoulders look pretty exposed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His helmet is pretty cool, but it pretty hollow as well. A red light piece makes up the 'eye'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Parts</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few cool parts, such as the two cords and the toxic containers. But there is also a lime green tentacle piece that is supposed to be toxic material being shot out of Meltdown's arm. The launcher isn't anything new with Hero Factory, and rather common.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Playability</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bionicle/Hero Factory sets offer great playability. Being easy to bend and pose, Meltdown is a great addition to a LEGO builder's collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Overall</em></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Unlike the Heroes, Meltdown and the rest of the original villains come packed in standard boxes. The front has a nice picture of him with his name down by the bottom and his villain &#39;calling card&#39;. I don&#39;t recall if the villain boxes showed their arch-nemesis like the Heroes or not.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Meltdown has a fair amount of parts for a villain. He carries over many Bionicle pieces, like the blaster, as well as some bits from the Heroes. He also received a few parts unique to him, like his &#39;claws&#39; and the tentacle. I especially loved the toxic waste buckets on his shoulder and the new head piece. The color yellow really works for this guy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is a little more complex than the Heroes. Meltdown uses the same ball joint system but also incorporates many technic pieces to complete the look. It takes about fifteen minutes to construct, and I had a little trouble the first time!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished build looks great, and towers over the Heroes. Meltdown looks very evil. Some poses can get a little wobbly with the claw feet, but overall he is very sturdy.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Meltdown is definitley not the best 2010 HF, but he is still awesome. This one is worth getting for full price.</p>
