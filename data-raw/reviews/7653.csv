"Kalhiki","2010-07-16T11:47:27.443Z","Acidic Bug","My first of the three villains I got was Corroder. <br>BUILDING EXPERIENCE<br>It wasn't that great actually. Mainly because you have to build three identical parts. Those are his weapons. He not only has his hand weapons, but he also has one on his back. Plus each of these needs stickers, which makes it not the best. He also has a very simplistic build, so I'd like something a bit harder.<br>PARTS<br>Despite the building experience, you do get some good parts. There are the clawed feet, black Thornax Launcher (originally silver in Bionicle), the helmet, and claws. And, for MOCists, you have SIX(!) Y connectors. The claw piece is very cool and has some nicks and cuts in it like he was in a sword fight, or the blade itself is corroding.<br>PLAYABILITY/POSEABILITY<br>Playability is good. Especially if you have a hero to fight him. Poseability is... good. He has the right angle Agori arms which means no elbows. However his big weapons makes up for that. Plus, with elbows, he'd just seem goofy and his arms would probably be too long. But other than that, he has your basic poseability. <br>THE FIGURE ITSELF<br>Now that I've gone over everything he has to offer, how is the figure itself. Well, he's good. Out of the ones I have, Corroder isn't the best, but I still like him. He's very cool, his colors are good, and bad parts aside, very nice. I also like the whole bug aesthetic of this figure and the horn on his helmet is a welcome addition.<br>OVERALL AND VALUE<br>For around $13... Yeah. It does seem a bit pricey, though for what you get. You may want to get a different figure that appeals to you more, but I still do recommend him.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5

"BobaFett2","2010-09-03T00:45:20.64Z","Are you kidding me?","With Hero Factory is coming lower and lower expectations. Worse and worse sets come out...this isn't the worst, but it's not good. Anyways, let's hear what I have to say about this set.<br><h4>Parts</h4>Probably the greatest aspect of this set was the parts. It had a lot of new parts and some rare ones. I like the avmatoran arms for torsos but I really hate their use as arms on anything other than matoran. Notable parts are a great helmet, the shields, the claws on the shields, the Ben 10 Legs, and the feet. There's also a newer Torso (I call it the slouch torso), but it being unarmored, I consider a con. There's also lime parts, which are nice.<br><h4>Building Experience</h4>These sets are getting more and more Av-Toran like every year...there's not much of note, except that they have shortened arms and removed a joint in their elbows by replacing 4 parts per arm with 1 that doesn't look that good.<br><br><h4>Playability</h4>As with all TECHNIC Action Figure themes, playability is good. However, the arms are too small and even if it's more realistic (I disagree about that) the hands are huge for the arms. They also made the chest unarmored, meaning any attack hitting the core will go straight home and pretty much destroy him...not very effective on the back. However, I was reading the BZPower review and a ""Rhino"" mode does look nice, so it's a bit better rating because of that.<br><br>Out of the other 4 Villains, I consider XPlode the best (since he has normal arms and hands), followed by thunder (normal arms, bad hands), then Meltdown (likewise), then Corroder.<br><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Lime Parts</li><li>Lots of new parts</li><li>Rhino Head/Pose</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Expensive (5 less parts than original Toa for 4 more dollars-or same as a Glatorian with 15 less parts).</li><li>Av-Matoran Arms</li><li>Slouch Torso, on top of not even being armored</li><li>Claws too large for hands</li><li>Isn't as good as other villains...</li></ul>Anyways, as with Von Nebula, choose for yourself whether or not to buy him. It's all arbitrary and you may not think that this set is not very good.<br><br>",TRUE,3,5,4,4,3
"KodakKid365","2010-09-11T23:53:10.587Z","Cool idea","Corroder is a very cool set. The stickers were sort of annoying but it was an easy build. I must say a little to easy. he needs more pieces. The arms are a little to short but the hands are awesome. i didn't like the spot where the gun was supposed to be so I used some of my own pieces to put it on his back.Corroder is a very good set and all collecters should get it.",FALSE,4,5,3,5,4
"Shwizz_bo","2010-10-03T19:07:01.9Z","Close but not on the mark","The reason I titled this review as I did, is b/c the idea of the huge claw almost works but his arms aren't quite long enough to reach the ground and have him look forward at the same time. He looks very weird in that pose.<div><br></div><div>The first sets I got were Surge and Corroder. (purely because they battle each other on Surges canister.) I was very pleased with how complicated and interesting this set was. If you can see, there is a shield/claw on his back which is very cool. One thing I'd like to point is that his neck can't really bend as far as it is displayed on the box. We saw something similar to this with Furno and with this set we see it again. This does, however, prevent him from standing up completely strait. Now onward!<div><br></div><div>BUILDING EXPERIENCE: Corroder is the only full size set I have from Hero Factory at the moment, so after building two short guys it was a breath of fresh air to get a nice full set to build.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>PARTS: This set has some awesome pieces in it. Ah.... where to start! First, the claws he has are made from the new Hero Factory shield piece and a very cool, detailed corrosive claw. But alas, there are stickers. I don't really find these as irritating as other people but it does take some time to get right. Now on to the helmet. The helmet is large and has a very cool horn on the front of it. His bio says that he uses his horn more than any other weapon he has, but it is very difficult to have him use his horn and make it look realistic. The one other thing that is stinky about him is that his meteor launch is mounted on his arm. This hampers him from shooting it in all directions. One other thing that is slightly annoying in that his lower leg pieces wiggle a little bit. Nothing big but still enough.<div><br></div><div>PLAYABILITY: (as it should be) When I buy Legos I really play with them, that is why I may write differently than other people. This guy is very evil looking and sinister. The big, big issue that I have with him is that his arms are the old 90 degree angle arms! :( This unfortunate flaw prevents him from from reaching far at all. :( but nevertheless I just have him jump really far at so that sort of makes up for that.&nbsp;Despite his flaws I would highly recommend Corroder to anyone who asks. Now it's time for the final verdict. I'll give Corroder a...........7.9 out of 10. Want him? You decide. This has been Shwizz bo. Thanks for reading my humble review. :)</div></div></div>",TRUE,4,4,5,3,4
"Mandalorian","2010-12-13T14:11:33.207Z","Mean green rhino machine","Probably, if you have read other reviews, many people say that Corroder looks like a rhino. And it's true. Anyway, I bought this set a long time ago, but I am reviewing him only now.<br>The building experience isn't great, I must admit. There are not many parts, but you get six really cool blades/green corroding things and six of those superb tri-axle pieces, which I love.<br>Aside from that, new to this set are: the blades, the things the blades are attached to, black Thornax Launcher pieces, the new torso, the mask wit a really big horn, lime Metru legs and stickers, which I am not particularly fond of.<br><br>Pros<br><ul><li>Pieces</li><li>Playability</li><li>Price</li><li>Overall look</li></ul>Cons:<br><ul><li>Not many pieces</li><li>Not an exciting build</li><li>Lots of stickers</li></ul><br>If you see this set, buy it, but if you don't, I don't think it's worth ordering online.<br><br>TL01<br><br>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5

"123MrBrick","2014-05-28T22:08:15.56Z","Great villain with one flaw.","<p>I got Corroder for Christmas 2010 and I loved him! While I may be biased because green is my favorite color, he is still an amazing HF figure!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Corroder comes in a box like the other 2010 villains. We get some nice art of him being Corroder-y. The front shows his little villain &#39;symbol&#39; and his name in big letters.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Corroder has a GREAT selection of parts. While he shares his claw-feet with many other villains, he has some new parts like the black acid-sprayers on his &#39;hands&#39;. I believe that the six sword-things are reused from Bionicle. The head piece is amazing! You could use it for a rhino MOC! Like Meltdown, Corroder has many Technic bits to support the details.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is kinda hard, but not the hardest of the 2010 sets. The &#39;hands&#39; were fun to do, but this set gets a little repetitive.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks really nice. This guy doesn&#39;t have that many parts, but he still manages to be huge! I love the looks you can get with him with his four-legged body. The only complaints I really have are that he is hard to pose without normal limbs, and that the backpack on my Corroder will. Not. STAY. ON! It is so annoying and sometimes I just leave it behind when I go to play with him.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great figure, awesome-looking. Nice parts, good for MOCs. Pick him up if you see him.</p>

"Matroxide","2012-08-03T12:30:12.317Z","You got to be kidding me!","At first&nbsp;I was quite excited to get Corroder but...&nbsp;Ugh... Corroder was my first Hero Factory set and well... not as impresing as Bionicle was. The build was short, the value for money&nbsp;was horrendous because it&nbsp;had cheap plastic that broke easily. Not to be cinical but I think Hero Factory was not very pleasing. It will realy need to make a breakthrough to make it more appealing or it wont get far.",FALSE,2,1,1,2,1
"flarefish","2014-12-02T07:37:20.58Z","acid king","<p>Corroder is the acid king and my favorite hero factory set of all time. Corroder&nbsp;is a all 4 villain who specializes in acid attacks. Corroders&nbsp;meteor shooter is placed on his biceps instead of on his hand. Corroder does not have hands that are a single piece but he does have completely huge claws with stickers and cool blades. His head is great but his jaw does stick out a little to much so that does look a little derpy, but his horn is really good because it looks like it would shoot acid or some other epic poisonous liquid.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>Really cool place to put shooter.</p>

<p>Epic claws.</p>

<p>Really good head.</p>

<p>Great as a all 4 villain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>Jaw sticks out a little to much.</p>

<p>Underside is bare and boring.</p>

<p>Stickers are hard to put on and if you fail you sort of ruin the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My rating out of 10 is 9.9.&nbsp;</p>
