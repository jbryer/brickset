"Paradoxymoron","2010-07-15T18:54:01.533Z","Thundering... Thing...","<p>Venturing to the nearest Toys R Us today to take advantage of a ""Buy One Get One 50% off"" sale, I discovered that every Hero Factory set, except for Von Nebula. I decided to get this and Corroder. Thunder has an assortment of new and recolored peices inside his box (yes I said box. It is a cardboard box, not a plasticat cannister). What I found interesting was that all the parts that I thought were silver are actually metallic dark grey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Nice colors</li>
<li>2. New parts</li>
<li>3. Cool helmet</li>
<li>4. Claw thing</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Stickers. There are a total of 15.</li>
<li>2. The armor on the right arm gets in the way sometimes</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, Thunder is a pretty good, and I suggest any fan of Bionicle, or anyone who is looking for a Hero Factory villain.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"Kalhiki","2010-07-31T13:36:47.453Z","Big mean and nasty","<p>Out of the villains I have (Rotor, Corroder, and of course Thunder) this is probably my favorite.</p>
<p><b>BUILDING EXPERIENCE - </b>There wasn't much new or different. The only thing that was weird was the placement of some armor. But the claw was fun to build. Really, you may not even need the instructions. There are sadly stickers. When you apply these, be sure you have them on correctly. If you have them all on correctly, the fist on the sticker should be facing toward the right if I'm not mistaken. If you didn't put them on right, you can always switch the whole piece.</p>
<p><b>PARTS - </b>Hero Factory has many new parts in their sets, and Thunder is no different. He has the Hero Factory armor piece (the one on his chest and weapons), helmet, and claw. There are also some nice recolors such as the black Thornax launcher and the dark metallic gray Bionicle Stars feet. Yes, dark metallic gray. As opposed to the picture, it is not silver like Bulk. It isn't quite gunmetal, but a little lighter.</p>
<p><b>PLAYABILITY AND POSEABILITY - </b>Poseability is great. Despite some odd armor placements, he is still easy to get into a number of poses. The only bad part I can see is that, due to how his head is attached, he can't look side to side. But he still has that awesome claw, which you can open and close and shove Heroes in. With good poseability, playability increases. You can have him terrorize Lego City, or wreak havoc around the house. However, if you want to get the most out of this set, I do recommend picking up a Hero to fight him.</p>
<p><b>OVERALL - </b>This set is awesome. The colors are nice, the articulation is good, and all around he is great. For 13 dollars, I don't think you will be disappointed. Definitely pick him up when you see him.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"Shwizz_bo","2010-10-24T21:18:54.19Z","Not cool Lego. Not cool.","I have only played with this set for a small amount of time, but I have determined to never buy this guy. :( I'm not trying to totally tear this set down, but from what I've come up with Thunder is just a cheap hunk of plastic thrown together and packaged as a fabulous set. I mean with all the miss-leadingly attractive silver shine on this guy and his poorly put together claw, what you are left with is undesirable to the max. Sorry for the put-downs, but I'm just really not impressed. :(<div><br></div><div>Building experience: This guy is OK on the build. His claw IS fun to build but when you get down to it, but his claw can be just a pain. His neck is sort of strange. Instead of using the neck on the torso, Lego has placed his neck on a new shield piece with a strait Hordika neck. Speaking of Hordika necks, these are the pieces that are used to connect his hands to his arms. Because of this, it GREATLY limits his reach in both hands.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>PARTS: His parts are another pain. The armor on the back of his arms is another thing that hampers his playability. This is because the armor gets stuck between his chest plate and his torso. His helmet is ok I guess. It makes him look like he is really stupid. :( As I hinted at before, his packaging is designed to make him look good but he really isn't. His whole color scheme is this weird sort of grey and silver. Don't get it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Playability: I'm going to keep this brief. His playability is a disgrace. He can barely move at all.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Well, what more can I say? This set is awful, case closed. :( Lego has really dropped the ball on this one. VERY bad set. :(</div><div><br></div><div>This has been Shwizz bo.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,2,3,4,1,4
"Darthleapyous","2011-01-13T05:27:11.547Z","Big bad brute!","<p>I got this set a couple of weeks ago, it is my first hero factory set. Thunder is a pretty cool villain, he has a meteor blaster and a crusher claw which can open and close. Unlike the Heros, Thunder's blaster actually shoots. Let's go to the pros and cons...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>* Crusher claw</p>
<p>* meteor blaster</p>
<p>* looks cool</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>*meteor blaster ball isn't transparent (or translucent)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall:</p>
<p>This set is pretty cool,&nbsp;I would&nbsp;recommend this set to any hero factory fan.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"KodakKid365","2010-12-02T18:39:07.78Z","Cool idea but not done well.","The gun moves around a lot so its extremly hard to make it look cool, and it's hard to aim it to shoot. The crushing claw is nice, and it's a good thing that the claws can move around a lot, but bad, because they also can not be positioned. The shoulder armor on the arm with the gun is cool, except you, like always, cant get it in position. The hands and weapons also can not be positioned. Thunder is great, or would be great, if it weren't for the positioning problems.",FALSE,3,4,4,3,3
"Mandalorian","2011-01-13T10:13:54.643Z","Quite cool","<p>I got Thunder for Christmas, and he's not a bad set. On to the review.</p>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The box</span></h4>
<p>The Hero Factory villains come i cardboard boxes instead of plastic canisters. This is bad, since they're easier to get destroyed. The front image shows Thunder in front of a destroyed wall with glowing eyes, which the actual set does not have. On the back he's shown battling Breez and then there's his stats. Also on the side of the box is his name in different languages: Trueno, Trovao, Mennyorges.</p>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The parts</span></h4>
<p>After you open the box, you most likely spill out the contents. These include: one bag with bigger pieces, one bag with smaller pieces, a sticker sheet (boo) and an instruction booklet.<br />
The new pieces in this set include: his gunmetal helmet (really cool btw), three gunmetal pieces for his claw, gunmetal Stars feet, a gunmetal Mata Nui sheild piece, Inika shoulder armour piece and Inika thigh armour piece, a new torso piece, two black Thornax launcher pieces and three light gray plate things</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Building thunder is a good experience. He's not too easy, but far from complicated. His build is different from what we had for the past four years. And this is good. Now, I would have rated the build 5, but the stickers... Those are awful to put on. Lego really should go back to printing on plastic.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>Overall Thunder is worth it. He looks good, and the playability is great, especially if you also have a hero. So, if you don't have him, quit wasting your time and go get him somwhere, since it's a new year and he's discontinued now.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
