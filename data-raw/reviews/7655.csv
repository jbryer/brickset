I must say, though, out of the villain sets, he is probably the most solid and doesn't look all that lanky.<br>BUILDING<br>Building was easy and not too repetitive. The only thing would be the legs which you have to build seperatly. They aren't cloned. Really the only thing to complain about would be applying the stickers. However, they are smaller than the spot you put them and they're spread apart enough that you don't have to worry much about getting them completely straight. Also one set of stickers is different than the other two. This one is for his chest plate.<br>PARTS<br>Though there are only three new parts, there are also great recolors. Some to note are the orange ankle guards, pistons, launcher, and the dark silver gas shooter. One of the new pieces is the armor, which is also in other villain sets, the double sided pin with a pin hole in the middle, and the helmet. I do have an issue with the helmet. Though it looks cool, it is missing eye holes. They have oval shapes where they should be, but I believe they're supposed to resemble goggles. I don't think I would like it if they were cut out, but maybe if they were transparent, it would be better.<br>PLAYABILITY/POSEABILITY<br>Playability is great as long as you have a hero. Rotor is a great looking villain that could terrorize your Lego city, or fly around the house. With a hero, it's even better because then you could have someone to fight him. Poseability-wise, he's good. The elbows allow the arm to not only move up and down, but also side to side. His helicopter backpack can move around too. One complaint I do have are his legs. Do to how they're built, you can't have them bent at the knee all the way and have his toe down at the same time. It's not too major, but I would like that movement for some flying poses. His head, do to how it's connected, can't move side to side, but that also isn't very major.<br>THE FIGURE<br>The figure itself and all around is cool. We don't see much orange if you think about it. There are a few gripes I have though. The elbows are cool with articulation, but they're thin. I feel the best way to deal with this is to just twist him at the elbow a bit, so you see the side of the forearm where the stickers are. I'm also sad that his gas shoter doesn't spin. I was hopeing it would, but how it's connected, it can't. I made a slight modification to him. The tube leading to his gas shooter stuck out too much. Therefore, I took it, kept it connected on his shoulder, and had it wrap around the bottom and connect to the outer rod hole. In my opinion, this makes it look much better. I just wish there was a gear function to spin his propeller. <br>OVERALL AND VALUE. <br>For twenty to twenty five bucks, it's great. It's solid, and fun to play with. I do highly recommend him if you were thinking on getting him, or if you just want a HF villain.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

Until now bulk has been defeating Bionicles,But I wanted a real villain from Hero factory.at first I was going to get Meltdown,but later I got more money for mowing the lawn,So I decided to get rotor.He is definitly one of the best figurs I have ever got even better than Mata nui,Toa mata pohatu,even nuhvok.The orange is perfect and actully really rare.The weapons are okay.The helmet is pretty cool and I do not really care that the eyes Are solid orange.The new villain armor is well okay not anything special though.I love how the bio hazard gas gun is tube fed.The rotor blade on top of Rotor is is almost as large as the figur itself.</p>

The building of the figure is involved and fun, it's nice to see where the designers get creative. Once built he feels very solid and dynamic. I love the orange and black colour scheme a lot. Articulation is great and not hindered at all. I'm also really glad to see there is no useless action gimmick jammed into the build. the rotor is free spinning with no gears to clutter it up.</p><p>the best feature of Rotor is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;his legs. very beefy and powerful looking. the armour bits are nice and angular and dangerous (for his enemies). Tubes running throughout his body give the impression of coursing energy just waiting to be released. I hear a lot of people complain about the lack of eye holes in his mask but honestly it doesn't make that big a deal - please do not let that get in the way of buying this figure. Also get over the fact that there are stickers. whoop-de-doo, don't like em, don't put em on.</p><p>if there is one downside to Rotor it's the really spindly arms. the official photos are very&nbsp;deceiving&nbsp;in making them look bulky. the black armour bit on is arm is very flat. I suggest rebuilding them once you crack him open. And there are a few other loose ends as well - such as the visible connector-axle in the rotor that can be covered with a spacer, and the spacers on the inside of his feet can be replaced with appropriate Bohrok <font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">eyes.</span></font></p><h4>Pros:</h4><div><ul><li>Strong build</li><li>Cool colours</li><li>Great Articulation</li><li>Hold poses well - dynamic</li><li>Awesome set for parts</li><li>large imposing size and stature</li><li>no action feature to get in the way</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4></div><div><ul><li>Poor arm design</li><li>a few unfinished/rough edges</li></ul><p>A great figure only hindered by what I suggested above.

Now let's be on with the review.<br><br>Building: Rotor's building is great. It's not like most other Hero Factory set's so I like that. My favorite part was probably building his legs. It's probably because of the pistons and I like working with those gray and red pieces.(idk what there called). Overall a very fun build.5/5<br><br>Parts: I love these parts. The mask is good and so is gas weapon. I like the ball launcher and the jet pack is awesome. Rotor's orange pieces are terrific. However I would like a little more orange. My favorite part though is the rotating blades.5/5<br><br>Play: There is good playability with Rotor but I find it more fun with a hero. It take's time to pose him but I don't mind. In my opinion get another set with him.4/5<br><br>Value: I got a great deal for him. I found the last one at Wal Mart and you know they go for around 20 bucks. Well I got him for NINE dollars(same price I got the atlantis sea scorpion). This was an amazing price so get him at wal mart ASAP.5/5<br><br>Overall: Overall he's a great set. I'd say get him at Wal Mart to save the 11 dollars. The parts are good and the building is to. SO GET ROTOR!5/5<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

"Mandalorian","2011-01-13T10:34:15.733Z","Rotor rocks","I got Rotor for Christmas along with Thunder and Bulk, and I gotta say he rocks. Anyway:<br><h4>The box</h4>If you have Von Nebula, then you know what the box looks like. If you don't, I'll tell you: it's square. It shows Rotor hovering in the air, something that the actual set cannot do. Gas is shown getting out of his Biohazard Gas Shooter, and in the set it doesn't. On the back he's shown battling Furno. But no one really cares about the box, so lets go on.<br><h4>The parts</h4>The parts, oh the parts. Awesome. Amazing. Great. Orange. This set has so many awesome parts, that you automaticaly say ""wow"". I'll just list a few new ones: his helmet (which sadly doesn't have eyeholes), orange Thornax Launcher pieces, a gunmetal Av-Matoran jetpack and an orange tube. And Rotor, or at least the Rotor I got has something else: 2011 sockets. I can't see how these can be called 2011 sockets since they appeared in 2010, but they are by far the best sockets ever. <br><h4>The build</h4>Rotor's build is fantastic. While it may not be as fantastic as Von Nebula's, it's still fantastic. Nothing more to say here.<br><h4>Overall</h4>If you don't have him, get him. That's my advice, and my advice is good :P. He's worth what you'll spend on him, and if you're a MOCer, the pieces are terrific.<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"toainikainthesky","2014-09-17T01:43:15.777Z","Blades and all!","<p>I just put this set back together after over 4 years of being disassembled. My overall opinion is that this is just an awesome set because it is the most like a Bionicle&nbsp;Titan model&nbsp;of all the Hero Factory sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not the best parts I&#39;ve ever seen, but they make him look really cool. Most of them had already been made for Bionicle, just in different colors. There is something I don&#39;t like about one part. The mask has no eye holes and looks kind of fake.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty simple build for a Titan-type model.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very nice looking. They didn&#39;t put too many features on him. Pretty much just the helicopter jet-pack, the gun that shoots the plasma ball, and of course the articulation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A few minor things I don&#39;t like, but overall a very good set.&nbsp;</p>

"Mcwequiesk","2011-12-28T02:05:16.32Z","Quite a Nice Set to Have","<p>Hello, and today I am reviewing this rather recent Lego Hero Factory set, called Rotor. This set by itself is quite nice,
 but with a hero, or something else for it to potentially fight, it is 
made even better. This set contains quite some decent parts, the model itself is excellently and cleverly designed, and there are a few things you can do to the model to increase its sheer awesomeness. For example, I attached wheels to Rotor's feet to increase his agility and speed and make for more epicness.</p><p><br></p><p>First of all, all the parts in this model are okay. There are some recent little black shield parts, used on his chest and on his arms, that I have not seen before. He has pipes running the course of his body, which appears to give him more of a robotic feel. His legs are large and interesting, as they use the pull-bars or cages, or whatever you call them, that appear on most modern large sets. The upper legs have knee pads the manage to cover the whole thing, and his feet have spikes on one side, and not the other. The rotor itself contains some massive blades that we all love to make amazing weapons out of, and the base of the rotor has some rocket or air engines that help him fly. One particular part is the jet pack used as some sort of an air blaster in one arm. The other arm, of course, just has an energy plasma fire magma heat water thornax ball sphere thingy shooter, that, guess what, shoots! His mask, however, is what bothers me slightly. Now, it would be perfect... if it had eye holes. Seriously, this guy can't even see! Or maybe he can, and its just that kind of one-way glass stuff you see on buses. If not, though, this is a terrible mask. Sure, it doesn't matter since this is just a toy... But, if you look at something realistically, then this is a bad way to go.<br></p><p><br></p><p>The model itself is quite designed in a clever manner. The whole body is built on a center bar that holds together everything. The hip piece manages to secure the chestplate and make the change seem natural. His legs certainly do go for the robotic feel, as they use a number of thin bars and pins to connect and secure the design. His feet are just standard feet, with a few braces to apparently hold them together. What really bothers me about his design, despite his mask, are his arms. They are so thin and flimsy and unsupported for such a large robot. You can see the juniorization here, because the main chunks of the arms, the black shields, are just one piece. Well, the rotor on his back is mostly flawless... you can detach it, it has little supporting air blasters, and it spins freely and quickly... but, in certain poses, it will end up cutting the pipe attaching his right shoulder to his air cannon thing on his right arm. I cannot tell you how many times it has got in the way of my spinning! It bothers me so much, and that is why I took it off the model.</p><p><br></p><p>There are some little modifications you can make to Rotor to make him more likable. Like I said above, you can take off the pipe on his right arm if it bothers you like it does me. A few more black parts can attach to the under areas of his lower arms to make them look stronger, or more powerful. What thing I did that I am particularly very proud of is the fact that I attached two large wheels to both of Rotor's feet, in the place of the orange Bohrok spikes, which I in turn, attached to his chest via some red pins. These wheels sure do make him much more agile, and quick, and while being able to fly, it makes him a mighty foe.</p><p><br></p><p>To sum it all up, Rotor is a very interesting set. The parts are similar to that of Bionicles, except not nearly as breakable. The mask haunts me, though, by not having eye holes. The model design is clever and bulky, and very powerful and heavy, but this leads me to believe he might not really be able to fly. And lastly, you can make some little modifications to the model to improve Rotor by tons. I'd say, if you see this set and have enough money, buy it, but don't go out of your way to find a Rotor, unless he for some reason appeals to you. Thank you for reading, and have a nice day.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
