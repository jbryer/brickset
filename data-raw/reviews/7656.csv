"Kalhiki","2010-06-30T13:26:34.533Z","Alpha Team Leader","<p>Well I went to Toys R Us and as I hoped, the heroes were there. Stormer is just one of three that I picked up.</p>
<p>BUILDING</p>
<p>The building experience was basically the same as that of the Agori if you're a fan of Bionicle. In other words, snap the pieces together and your done. No directions are really even needed, but they are included anyway. The only part that could probably confuse someone would be placing the weapon arm on the correct side.</p>
<p>PARTS</p>
<p>As for parts,&nbsp;5 out of the total 17 pieces are reused. Which means this guy is a plethora of new parts. The body is a very nice design and also has more of a bulky back to it. The&nbsp;neck sticks out a bit, but it isn't that bad since you have the armor. Speaking of the armor, it is unique to Stormer and thus is not on any other hero so far. It has an assymetrical design with a line pattern on the right and a dotted design on the left of each side of the chest. On his shoulders he has three spikes on each. His Hero Core is a seperate piece which could be switched with other heroes for customization. It's round with an H in the middle along with another&nbsp;section on the bottom that juts out from the circle. It tabs in with a small peg that a minifig could hold onto. </p>
<p>The helmet is cool and has the same dotted pattern on the side the chest armor had it. His eye hole is basically a line which makes it seem like a visor, and he has a big chin. The arms and legs&nbsp;are very nice except they're a little thin, but they do look fantastic. I also like the leg armor which has a neat shin guard. The thigh armor included slightly reminds me of the Toa Metru&nbsp;thigh armor also from Bionicle. The feet are good, not much to say with them. However, due to how the ankle hooks up, he has a more human range of articulation.</p>
<p>O.K. The weapon arm. Main problem: It's hollow. The only good veiw of it is from the outside. It's also, due to the hollow space,&nbsp;cut off looking from a top or bottom view.&nbsp;The other problem: It's loaded with stuff. It looks like a giant Swiss Army Knife exploded. I can understand being prepared, but this is just rediculous. It has some sort of ice blade which is rubbery, a harpoon gun, a saw, and a piton I do belive it was described as. The arm also has a molded in hand and another H on the elbow.</p>
<p>PLAYABILITY</p>
<p>Playability is good with a little imagination. He doesn't have knee or elbow joints, but that's okay. I do advise getting a villain once they come out so you have someone to fight. But beings as though they go across the galaxy and fight intergalactic enemies, you could pretend your house cat is terrorizing Lego City and Stormer has to save the town. It's up to you.</p>
<p>VALUE FOR THE MONEY AND OVERALL RATING</p>
<p>Eight dollars. Yeah I'd pay that. He's larger than I expected, so that's good. Preston Stormer is a good buy, but if the weapon arm doesn't appeal to you, then maybe pick up someone who you like more. I do recommend getting some HF sets especially some of the Heroes.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5

"exo_man","2010-08-03T17:39:28.387Z","A Great Set!","<p>I got Preston a few days ago and I must say, he is a very solid set! His armor protects him very well. His mask looks very cool. But as everyone else said the weapon arm holds many dark secrets....... well what is really wrong with it is that it is HOLLOW! also the ice thing on the front it soft and rubery. But aside from that this set is a great buy! The build is not really anything at all (I did not even need the instructions!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Nice mask.</li>
    <li>Good armor.</li>
    <li>New leg armor.</li>
    <li>New arms.</li>
    <li>New feet.</li>
    <li>Hero Core!</li>
    <li>Fun to play with.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Hollow arm.</li>
    <li>Not much posebility.</li>
    <li>Feet can't move much.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I recomend you get this set! It has great value and is fun to play with!</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,5

<p>Preston Stormer is Very Well Designed,&nbsp;May I Even Say&nbsp;Marvelous! The hero Core is very Good Looking and Fun to Own. The Armor Is very Icy Looking, But The Best Part about This Piece is It's Exclusive to the Set! Pros/Cons:</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>*Cool Kanoh-.....Mask :D</li>
    <li>*Neat Hero Core.</li>
    <li>*Best Thing About These Heros is they're Armor is Different in Each Character! Making Them Non-Clones. Something Bionicle was Laking.</li>
    <li>*Six New Pieces.</li>
    <li>*Cheap.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

"tyuku57","2010-10-02T03:42:04.71Z","Hero factory please let us take your order","<p>Now preston stormer is the leader of hero factory and has 5/19 parts reused which is cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason i rated the building so low is because its only 19 parts but the cost is 7 pounds so this is a good set. although he has few parts he can show off his hero core and his armour. Hope this review helped.</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5
"KodakKid365","2010-09-05T09:55:00.617Z","Okay","Okay,its annoying how the weapon and the hand are one so you can never take off the weapon and just use the hand. The weapon is cool except for the blue part.Thats because it bends. His head is just to human like. His color design is awesome though. The thing I really hate is ""Stormer! Strongest hero in the galaxy! Over 6 cm tall!"" He is SO small.",FALSE,3,3,2,4,3

 and on the website. he has a great color-scheme and very sturdy. to 
break him, you'd have to work hard. His head is a translucent light 
blue, just like his hero core. The ice weapon and right arm are all one

is rubber. Overall, a great set!</span>",FALSE,4,4,3,3,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>1. Surprisingly... super, super playable. My only 1.0, but playability-wise, he rocks.<br></li><li>2. For MY money, he was very worth it. For the 8 dollars needed in-stores, I think... it would be just worth it.<br></li><li>3. It comes with his helmet &amp; Hero Core.</li><li>4. His more ""Technicky"", meaning that you can add more ""extra pieces"".<br></li><li><br></li><li>CONS<br></li></ul>

<ul><li>1. He is, after all, the 'Hero' that overturned BIONICLE. <br></li><li>1.5 He has only one hand. That sucks more than you'd think.</li><li>2. His parts are useless for using in other models.&nbsp;</li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>When I played with him (long, long ago, in a galaxy far far away...), I added a jetpack, a gun-arm extender, and Tahu Mata's flame on him. He looked great! The new Hero Factorys are simply uncustomizable. I would say that this is a set worth the 8 bucks. But be warned, there is absolutely zilch building experience.<br></p>",TRUE,2,1,1,5,2
