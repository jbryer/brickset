After a long week at school it was great to come back to &nbsp;new Hero Set!<div><br></div><div><b>Building Experience</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Well, this isn't anything ""new"" really.

"C_Fish","2010-12-22T18:19:45.02Z","""...an unsung hero of Hero Factory - Natalie Breez."" ","<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall:</span></p>This set is a great one, but it's really nothing extraordinary, though I feel I'm right in giving it five stars. The lime-green color scheme is a nice touch and a refreshing change after years of blue female Bionicle sets. The helmet lends a slight feminine touch to the set, which is rather nice, seeing as Breez is a girl. <br>&nbsp;<br><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Building Experience:</span></p>The build is very simple, but it's complicated enough that the instructions may be needed for younger fans. It's not too much different from the Av-Matoran/Agori build, but not quite as boring, mostly due to the legs and feet. (Though it still only takes less than a minute...)<br>&nbsp;<br><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Parts:</span></p>As said before, the lime-green parts are a nice touch, and the helmet is just feminine enough that you can tell Breez is a girl. The leg armor is great, but lacks in MOC-ability, which is a minor annoyance. Breez's boomerang/grappling hook weapons are made of a slightly rubbery plastic, a substance that's not rubbery enough to be annoying, but flexible to withstand people stepping on it, which is nice. Breez also has a ruby Hero Core, which is cool, but it unfortunately clashes with her orange head. <br>&nbsp;<br><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Playability:</span></p>Breez has good playability; nothing wonderful, but still fun to play with. The lack of elbow and knee joints is annoying, as it limits posing options as well as playability, but then again, it would be quite difficult for Lego to get joints in such a small figure. A very small drawback is that Breez's weapons are boomerangs, not some sort of shooting weapon, so you can't really blast your family dog (a.k.a. giant city-smashing monster) with them. <br>&nbsp;<br><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Value for Money: </p>This set costs $7.99, which I feel is slightly steep, not bad though. You get four parts that are unique to Breez, which I think is quite a lot, as well as quite a few parts that are only found in 2010 Hero Factory sets.<br><br>When you add up the pros and cons, Breez becomes quite a nice little set, one that looks nice on the shelf, one that has good playability, and one that can easily depose of any evil villain under nine feet tall.<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">For more on Natalie Breez, visit</span> <a href=""http://herofactory.wikia.com/wiki/Natalie_Breez"" target=""_new"" title=""Link opens in new window"">http://herofactory.wikia.com/wiki/Natalie_Breez</a>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
"KodakKid365","2010-11-16T23:44:11.373Z","Not cool","Okay, Breeze is a very bad set. The weapons are sorta cool but that's all. The color shceme is boring, her face is ugly, and it's to easy to build. There isn't much to say, she just stinks. I don't reccomend you buy this set unless it's for 5 bucks or less",FALSE,3,3,2,4,3

"Malurus","2012-08-11T10:55:37.577Z","Ummm...","Ok, for starters, I was a bit excited about Hero Factory when it came out. However, when I got Natalie I was depressed, wondering why Bionicle had died off for it's sake. The pieces were too big, and the plastic was cheap and can break very easily (I noticed by the time I was&nbsp;done with her she already snapped at the joints). The playability was very limited as the storyline went WAY to fast and you did'nt have time to callect them all. And eight bucks for a five minute build that is made of cheap plastic?! Sorry, HF fans, but these sets are NOT woth that much.",FALSE,3,2,1,1,2
