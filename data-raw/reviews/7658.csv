William Furno isn't quite as good as Mark Surge in my eyes but he's pretty good! Lets start with pieces.</div><div><div><br></div><div><b>Building Experience</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>It's nothing new when it comes to building. We all know the feeling of building an Agori, all though the Heroes have <i>much</i>&nbsp;more detail then the Agori. The Hero Core changes things as well. It's fun to swap them around, mix and match.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Pieces</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Well new pieces...of course. The arm and leg pieces are new this year, a bit better then the Agori pieces. They have a less degree angle then the Agori's. The feet are also new as well and are good for standing your set up, an improvement to the Stars. The leg armor is actually really cool! It doesn't hinder the feet but it actually improves how they work! It stops them from being able to fall over of lean forward too much. The chest armor houses the Hero Core but this isn't good for MOCing as it won't fit on any of the other sets. The helmet is smaller then I thought it would've been but it is still very cool! And not to mention the very cool weapons! You can use them as one sword, two daggers or even&nbsp;jet-packs! It's amazing!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Playability</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Well, these are much better then the Stars and Agori and much easier to&nbsp;maneuver. The leg armor stops him from falling over which is very useful. Well done Lego! Weapons are great for changing what they can do! Very&nbsp;posable&nbsp;and fun to play with.

"wholikesthewho","2010-07-23T22:57:39.837Z","Epic Hero","<p>Okay, this is my first Brickset review so bear with me. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start by saying that Will Furno is the best Hero Factory set I own. (I have Stormer, Surge, Breez and Furno currently.) He has an epic red and orange paint job, good bulk, an awesome helmet, and the best weapon on a hero. (2 awesome fire blades) I found over 30 ways for him to hold his weapon including the&nbsp;""wings""&nbsp;Furno's only con is the building process. Like all HF heroes, I could build Furno with my&nbsp; eyes closed and hands tied behind my back. (Not kidding!) But overall Furno is the best HF set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5
"Bob_Prime","2010-08-30T23:02:35.56Z","I could buy it again and again and again and again BUT NOT six times!","<p>Do you remember how, back in the Bionicle days, there would be little low-price-point guys (usually Matoran), then medium-size hero guys (usually Toa), and then miscellaneous large sets? The heroes of <em>Hero Factory</em>, like William Furno here, are&nbsp;a sort of meeting point between those first two. They're about the height of the Toa, with the complexity of the Matoran.</p>
<p>This might make it sound like they're stretched too thin, parts-wise; and indeed, I can take Furno apart and put him back together in maybe two minutes, but as an action figure, William Furno is appropriately heroic, as is the rest of the team, presumably. He lacks elbow or knee articulation, but this hardly hampers his&nbsp;potential for poses, as he's got almost every other joint one could reasonably expect from a figure of this size.&nbsp;The formula for Hero Factory heroes&nbsp;might grow old after five more purchases, but I'll definitely get another one.</p>
<p>Also, I love the weapon. Rock 'n' Roll Devil Horns of Justice!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"greshmalum","2011-05-17T09:39:47.027Z","7167 William Furno","<h4>Pictures</h4>
<p>Most of Lego's pictures make this guy look ugly and left handed. He is neither. He is right handed and TOTALLY AWESOME.</p>
<h4>Elements (pieces)</h4>
<p>William Furno has:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two Hero Factory original (original as opposed to 2.0 or 3.0) feet in&nbsp;red.&nbsp;My brother says they don't, but I say they have boot jets in the back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two Bionicle&nbsp;2008 connectors (the ones used for bionicle hands, furno's foot connectors, etc.) in black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four Hero Factory original arms/legs in yellow orange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two Hero Factory original leg armor elements in red.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One BIONICLE 2009 Glatorian head in translucent yellow green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Hero Factory original body piece in black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Hero Factory original Rookie chest plate, red.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Hero Factory original Hero Core in translucent yellow green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One William Furno original helmet in red. This has lots of little gadgets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two BIONICLE 2009 Glatorian hands in red.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two William Furno/Fire Lord Dual Fire Shooter halves. I believe they may be used as two swords after their charges are emptied.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>William Furno is awesome. Don't get me wrong, 2.0's are awesome too, but you have to get the originals. I miss them. I have seen Brickset pictures of Furno 3.0 and he is looking quite disappointing. Get William Furno (original).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. My brother has Furno 2.0 and he is not all that bad. Seems like LEGO just doesn't know how to take good pictures of Furno.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

All he can do is pose badly. One thing you CAN do is take his weapons and put them on his back like jetpacks, which is sort of cool. I just can't stand the small thing. Von Nebula could kill him by stepping on him.",FALSE,3,3,2,4,3
"Shwizz_bo","2010-10-01T10:47:55.343Z","Furno is a disappointment?","Furno is an awesome set don't get me wrong but, I do have a few issues with him. One thing i'd like to point out is that furnos wrist can't really bend the way it's displayed on the box. In fact the wrist is the most frustrating part of him. I really play with the sets I buy so I'm going to be a little different in the way I write, so bear with me here.<div><br></div><div>BUILDING EXPERIENCE: The reason the I marked Furno down in this is because he is ,as you know, short and not as fun to build as the taller bionicle sets.</div><div><br></div><div>PARTS: The parts are fabulous. The Quasa Core really goes great with his armor and sword. His chest plate is very detailed and well thought out. GOOD JOB LEGO. :) His helmet is also very detailed. Is has a microphone and a cool visor with other assorted gadgets here and there. His arms and legs are an improvement as well. They are no longer 90 degree angle arms, they are now open a little more, which is an excellent addition. Now on to his sword, and what a cool weapon it is. It is very detailed and fits great on his hand, but, yes but, there really isn't a good way to put him in a casual position. His weapon is just to long. The way it sits on his hand hampers the flexibility of his wrist. So don't be fooled just because the box shows him in that epic pose, doesn't mean you can really do that pose. But one way to do it is to put the sword on his arms like wings. That's pretty cool.</div><div><br></div><div>PLAYABILITY: (as it should be) Now, being the leader of the rookie team, furno has command over other heros. That makes him pretty cool in action to me. As I mentioned before, his sword is really, just too long. :( it makes it a little hard to fight with him, but you get used to it. :)</div><div><br></div><div>As we near the end of this segment it comes time for the final verdict. I'll give furno a.......7.1 out of 10. Well, do you want to get him? Thats up to you. Thanks for reading my humble review. This has been Shwizz bo.</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,4

<li>Lots of new pieces. 
<li>Is remeniscent of a Bionicle but, without all the weird stuff.

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A small canister with a flat, red lid. The instructions are completely useless.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Heavily juniorised, single use, and joint-cracking rubbish. The core makes a nice laser cannon and the helmet can be used on Brain Attack heads, but really, you can&#39;t make much of anything with these.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Snap. Snap. Snap. Shove technic pins in. Done. This is what I spent $8 on?</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is generally lacking in armor, detail, decent color scheme, or originality. You can pose it a little bit, I suppose, but there isn&#39;t anything else that you can do... most of the joints are very restricted or nonexistent, and it looks hideous on a display stand.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is the true low point of constraction. I don&#39;t miss this stuff one little bit.</p>

<p>- This set is easily built between 1 and 2 minutes. Doesn&#39;t require instructions at all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Function</strong></p>

<p>- This set has no functions besides minor posing, some of which is restricted by bulky armor.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>- The only redeeming quality of this set is the many new and unique pieces which separate it from anything else Lego has made.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong></p>

<p>- This set retailed for much more than it should have as its low piece count, simple build, and small stature wasn&#39;t indicative of an $8&nbsp;(USD) cost.</p>
