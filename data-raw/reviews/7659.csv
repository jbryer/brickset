"Kalhiki","2010-06-30T14:29:17.8Z","All Brawn, Little Brain","<p>The last hero that I got was Bulk. I'll try to make this review quick.</p>
<p>BUILDING</p>
<p>Quick and simple. That's all I got to say. There isn't much to it.. However, he has the weapon arm on his left hand, so that's different. The other Heroes have the weapon arm on their right hand, so that'd be the only part you&nbsp;may get confused&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>PARTS</p>
<p>I'll only do the ones that are unique to Dunkan. His body armor is cool. It's very metal plate-ish and mechanical. There's not much to say about it. As for his helmet, it as well looks awsome. It has a triangular piece for a mouth guard which seems pretty solid. I was afraid it'd be fragile. He also has what seems like a communicator on his right side. The only problem I have with him is that his brow line is a little low for his eyes. It's not that bad like some *cough*MarkSurge*cough*, but it is noticable. Finally you have his weapon arm. The hollow-ness isn't as noticable as Stormer's, but it is there. It matches his armor well and looks good with him. I also like the molded in hand which has one finger bent like it's on a trigger. Overall, it's a nice looking gun.</p>
<p>I'm going to cover it here. The color is fantastic. I love the silver and black. He just looks great. Sadly, as others have said, he only has one silver Glatorian hand, which is a downer.</p>
<p>PLAYABILITY</p>
<p>Once we get the villains, playability will improve. Honestly, there needs to be a a bad guy to fight. But he could fight something around the house in the meantime like the monsters under the bed or the vaccum cleaner.</p>
<p>VALUE FOR THE MONEY AND OVERALL</p>
<p>Eight dollars is spectacular. If your getting one hero, make it Dunkan Bulk. He's cool, the silver is nice, and he's tough But, if really doesn't appeal to you that much, I do recommend picking up a Hero. I don't think you'll be upset.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"NickBrick","2010-07-01T18:11:40.097Z","While the story and names are corny the sets are so cool","<p>ever since I first saw him online[In early spring of 2010] I was so looking forward to getting Duncan bulk.when I fnally got him I was not disapointed.the silver coloring is so perfect.<br />
the build was surprisingly nice with some diffrences from the Av-matoran agori and stars.<br />
the weapon is so cool and looks realy powerful.I learned from brickipedia that the gun is supposed to shoot spheres of steel.The old only pieces are the pieces that usally connect the feet to the legs plus the head and hand.While there is not any golden armor to collect[obviuosly]the hero cores[transparent piece with an H on it]Are just as much fun to collect.<br />

over all this is a great hero factory set,well worth the money.if you're suspicious of hero factory because it replaced Bionicle just pick up this set and you will change your mind.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"Firox_5000","2010-07-25T12:09:26.46Z","Worst lego purchase","<p>I bought this at Tesco for £7.97 and all I can say is that I am disapointed with this set. The armour is puny , The design is poor and what you get for £8 ish is very minimal. The only posative thing I like about this set is the colour scheme. </p>

I finally bought Duncan Bulk in Wal-mart since he looked the most ""Cool"". I very much do like this set!</p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Building Experience</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While these new Hero factory heroes are just 7$ the building experience was low. Only about 17 pieces I actually memorized how to build him. So, the building only takes about 4-7 minutes and the end product is wonderful.</p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Duncan Bulk HIMSELF</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I really do enjoy this hero. I love his chrome coloring (mixed in with black). Although he is shorter than my other Bionicles he is of nice size to Von Nebula. The blaster-gun he has is very nicely molded and I do see MOC potential. His torso is unique unlike the Rookie Team who's torsos are all the same. His Hero Core is removable and the whole armor is a very nice plastic, not cheap. His head is another ""Iron Man"" head which looks nice under his armor.</p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Playability</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen children play with it and even if it is not with other HF heroes they still enjoy it. It is very sturdy and not breakable. Easily posable yet has alot of squeaky joints (most likely since I barley got him).</p><p><br></p><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PROS:</h4><h4><ul><li>new hero cores</li><li>Nice molded blaster-gun</li><li>Helmet is very nicely molded</li><li>Loving the new fists</li><li>Very sturdy</li><li><p>Best of All?

"Colonel14","2011-01-17T17:38:44.46Z","Duncan should consider becoming a V2...","<p>While browsing through the LEGO isle at Target, I found Hero Factory sets. <strong>Duncan Bulk </strong>caught my attention becuase of his awesome arm. But, once I was finished building Duncan, he wasn't really worth the money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Build</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Short and simple. Just like the old Bionicle Matoran sets in '09. The arm that looked so cool didn't look good to me anymore becuase it was only one piece that was hollow on one side.&nbsp;The other arm was just... there. The legs and arms both have limited movement, unlike the villains who have a wider range of movement. The mask and the chest armor is pretty cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Parts</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's the gun arm (which is pretty worthless), the mask, and the chest armor piece. That's all of the good parts, everything else isn't really&nbsp;that special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Playability</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Bioncile/Hero Factory set with limited playability!? That's just a crime. Meltdown could run cartwheels around Duncan (yes, you can make a cartwheel pose). Duncan would look like a flat tire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Value for Money</em></p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would not get this. Get the much better Villain sets, or some old Bionicles. They're probably better than this guy. Overall, Duncan needs to make the transfer to V2, or the Fire Lord will take him out quite easily (by doing cartwheels around him, of course).</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
