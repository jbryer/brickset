<p>Ok so I can't believe I found this already.&nbsp; It was at my local TRU along with Stringer, although I'll wait to get him.&nbsp; They were also the only two different Heroes in stock so it looks like we'll have to wait for the others.</p>
<p>Well, let's take a closer look at Surge.&nbsp; He of course is very Bionicle-esque.&nbsp; The only old pieces in this set though are the head, hands, and the socket pieces the connect his legs to his feet.&nbsp; What I really like are the leg armor pieces, which are larger pieces that cover the whole leg piece.&nbsp; He can also hold his weapons two different ways.</p>
<p>Overall, he is very much like the Bionicle Stars/Agori/Av-Matoran.&nbsp; He is a great addition to the collection of a Bionicle fan.&nbsp; If you are a Bionicle fan, don't be afraid to pick him up, even though the Hero Factory concept and the names are a little cheesy.&nbsp; He's an easy 5 out of 5.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,4
"Kalhiki","2010-06-30T14:03:16.62Z","Lightning Rookie","<p>One of three Heroes I got at Toys R Us, Mark Surge is the only Rookie I have.</p>
<p>BUILDING</p>
<p>Snap this here, put that there. Look, I'm done. Building him was incredibly easy, and didn't take very long. It has the same&nbsp;basic build as the Bionicle Stars, Agori, etc. only with new parts.&nbsp;Therefore, it was very easy. Only difference was adding the armor.</p>
<p>PARTS</p>
<p>Almost all the parts are new. He has the Rookie armor which looks spectacular. It has a rib cage/grate type of design and some tubes/wires here and there. I also like the shoulder spikes, which makes it look almost like&nbsp;the armor is wrapping around the body. The body is new and&nbsp;has a very nice back design. It has what appears to be shoulder blades or maybe it's just armor.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Hero&nbsp;Core is a seperate piece, but I'm not really going into it much.&nbsp;I find it interesting that it has a different color than the head being a little darker of a shade. The helmet is nice.&nbsp;The mouth is very interesting as it has very small bumps which make it seem like a speaker. The top&nbsp;of the head is neat. It has some spikes at the back and also some lightning zig zag lines on the top.The only problem I have is that the eye holes are too&nbsp;far down. His eyes on the head barely peek out.</p>
<p>The arms&nbsp;and legs are new, but can't bend at the elbow/knee. The leg armor I love. It's very cool and allows the foot wnough movement. Speaking of which, due to how the foot is connected, it has a human range of movement at the ankle. The foot itself is cool and a little weird. The&nbsp;heel is rounded and also has an arch. But I do like how it looks.The weapons are a little bigger than I would have liked. They kind of get in the way and drag around on the ground&nbsp;a bit.The handle looks cool. It has a dome shape with three prongs sticking out. It&nbsp;also has another peg where you&nbsp;could have Surge hold it like a sword. There are also&nbsp;fins on the sides which have a bumpy texture like it's made of metal. The lightning isn't much. It is a bendable plastic, but not rubbery. Don't move it too much or it'll break.&nbsp;It also only hooks up to the middle of the three prongs.</p>
<p>PLAYABILITY</p>
<p>Needs a villain, so once they come out get one. In the mean time, find something to use as an intergalactic&nbsp;villain or someone to save. For instance, your stuffed teddy bear has fallen underneath your bead and it's up to Surge to&nbsp;save him. Really, all you need is some imagination.</p>
<p>VALUE&nbsp;FOR THE MONEY AND OVERALL</p>
<p>Eight dollars is great.&nbsp;Mark Surge is a decent size for that amount and the bulk of him makes it better. I highly recommend picking him up if you can find him. If&nbsp;he doesn't appeal to you, I&nbsp;still have to recommend picking up a hero.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"Kingdonfin","2010-08-24T03:51:38.213Z","Mark Surge, A Shocking Start","I was very&nbsp;surprised when I opened my Mark Surge set! The detail put into pieces such was the weapons is better then with the BIONICLE sets. He's not hard to&nbsp;maneuver&nbsp;and has a good colour scheme.

"SWfreak","2010-07-13T16:22:11.847Z","Suprisingly flexible","I got this set just today and I have to say it's better than I expected. The flexibility is nice, which is unexpected because of the fact that the arms have no middle joints, but unlike the old ones from 2008 they don't have a nearly 90 degree angle giving it enough flexibility in the hands for some nice poses, of course it's still not as good as it could have been if it was full size.<br><br><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>New parts</li><li>More posable</li><li>Nice armor</li><li>Two part feet</li><li>New H in the middle, as it turns out there is a little stick thingy under the H to hold it in which I didn't notice till I saw it in real life so that will hopefully give it more rebuild possibilitys.<br></li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Lots of big parts</li><li>No middle leg or arm joints</li><li>He's short</li><li>Lightning doesn't come off of holders</li><li>Chest armor is a bit bendy because of not enough of it touching the actual set<br></li></ul>Overall a nice little set.<br>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,3
"Crt2","2010-07-21T22:59:27.827Z","Go! Go! *Sigh* Hero Factory.","<p>As Said Above, I Dislike The Storyline of This New Theme, But I am Quite Pleased with the sets. Actually, I Dislike The $13 sets But I Like Everything else. ;) I'm Hoping to get The Other 4 Heros &amp; Rotor. :D Now on The Set Itself: First of all, When I First saw Mark, I Thought Immediately That This was My Favorite Hero. I was Not Dissapointed. I Mean The Face, The Weapons, The Color......all Awesome. Pros/Cons:<br/>Pros<br/><br/>*Cool&nbsp;Helmet.</p>

I Mean Really, There The Same Price as The Stars!!<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>*Just Not Bionicle.<br/><br/>Overall<br/>I Prefer&nbsp;Surge to Stormer, So&nbsp;I Would Definitely&nbsp;Recommend This Set, A Very great Addition to Any Lego Lover's Collection.

"KodakKid365","2010-09-05T10:07:06.503Z","good set","The main reason I like surge is because of his weapons. First of all, he has two. Second, they aren't attached to his hand and third, they are just cool. I don't exactly like his design but thats an opinion. the color design is cool though. Thing is, he's short and not flexible.",FALSE,4,3,2,4,3
"Shwizz_bo","2010-10-03T21:42:55.613Z","Surge=Solid","So far reviewed two sets that have had both had their pros and their cons, but this set, this set is by far the solidest set I own. The Electro-swords and the gnarly mask just culminate into one of the coolest Heroes I've looked at. Now onward!<div><br></div><div>BUILDING EXPERIENCE: As most of you may know I've been giving three-brick rating to all the heroes i've reviewed; I was tempted to give him a four-brick rating because he looks so great but I resisted the urge.</div><div><br></div><div>PARTS: This set has a lot of new stuff. He has the new more open limbs, the Glatorion head (which comes with all heroes), the new hero feet and leg plates. The chest plate is the other new feature that I want to go over. His breast plate comes with a dark yellowish quasa core. This is something that intrigued me with this set. The head and core are not neon yellow and are really very dark. The plate follows the rookie pattern that we got with Furno and Breez. The two new features that are included in this set are the charge swords and his helmet. The helmet has a mic and camera-thing on the sides. It has a sort of lightning pattern on the top that is a very nice addition. His swords are very cool as well. They are not see-thru and are bendable. You can't tell, but they are connected to the side of his hands not the top. (Lego has done an almost perfect job concealing this fact but I find it useful.) I was incredibly glad to discover that, due to the way the swords are connected, he CAN pose in a causal position.</div><div><br></div><div>PLAYABILITY: (as it should be.) As you know when I buy Lego sets I really play with them So I probably will write differently than other reviewers out there. His playability is incredibly good. He can attack and pose flawlessly and easily. One thing that I was shocked to find was that when you put both his sword one hand in the upright position it really doesn't look good! :(</div><div><br></div><div>Well, after I got Surge I was very happy to play with him and I still am. In my opinion, Surge in the #1 hero out there. I would highly recommend this set to anyone. Now It's time for the final verdict. I'll give Surge a.......... 9.1! &nbsp;Want him? You decide. This has been Shwizz bo. Thank for reading this humble review. :)</div>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"123MrBrick","2014-05-29T17:51:04.087Z","Best 1.0 Hero","<p>Surge here was my first ever HF set. I loved him back then, great action figure. He is by far the best 1.0 Hero! He is also my personal fave.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This one comes in a canister, like Jimi Stringer. Nice artwork of Surge on the front with some blueprints and his name on it. The back shows him fighting his worst enemy, Corroder. Both sides of the packaging show &#39;from the makers of Bionicle&#39;. Label is prone to peeling.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Surge has some neat parts. Unfortunately, almost all of them are shared with his fellow &#39;Rookie&#39; 1.0&#39;s. He does, however, have a unique mask and a special set of lightning weapons. Although all of the armor is shared, it looks amazing in blue next to the trans-green stuff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy build. Snap together the pieces, put in a few technic bits, done.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great! I love the color scheme, but you really need to see it in person to appreciate it. The lightning weapons can be a gun, a pair of swords, or a staff, all of which are used in the TV show! The posability is a little better than the &#39;veterans&#39; because Mark&#39;s chestplate is smaller.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This figure is a great buy, but is pretty rare nowadays. Mark Surge has become my favorite Hero of all time!</p>

"Matroxide","2012-08-10T16:16:02.83Z","Best for Hero Factory","I got him for my birthday and was actualy suprized. He is my favorite of all the HF sets so far. Like&nbsp;I always say for these Hero Factory reviews, Cheap plastic, few parts and low over all quality. But&nbsp;I have to complement this set because of it's nice weapons, which you can put on one hand for a nice dome-lightning-shooter-thingy. The playability is limited though bacause the story line time is limited.&nbsp;If you want to buy any Hero Factory sets, this one is you're best option!",FALSE,3,2,2,2,3
