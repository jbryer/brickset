It falls short as both an action hero toy, &amp; as a lego set. I mean, c',mon. No bendable knees or elbows? Fists that can't grab anything?

"KodakKid365","2010-11-16T23:46:46.29Z","Not bad","Stringer has a very cool color design. His weapon is pretty cool. Something very cool you can do if you have Stringer and Stormer is if you take all the blue trims and replace them with Stringer's orange trim so he is blue and black.

This set is okay, but is nowhere near the awesomeness of Bionicle, especially because of a loss of story...<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul><li>-The legs and arms are very limited in what they can do.<br></li><li>-The weapon appears flat, and wimpy.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>I guess that this set is okay for a Hero Factory set, but if this is what the series after Bionicle is evolving into, I'm really disappointed. <br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,2
"123MrBrick","2014-05-28T21:32:38.94Z","A Fair 1.0","<p>I bought Stringer when he first came out and 7.99 was a great price. He has amazing quality, but the articulation is limited.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes packed in a canister, similar to the late sets of the Bionicle line up. The front has a nice image of Jimi Stringer with some blueprints and writing. The back shows him battling his arch-nemesis, Meltdown. &#39;From the makers of Bionicle&#39; is on both sides. The problem is the parts are loose in the canister, which could lead to damage to some of the fragile armor bits. The label is also prone to peeling.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t have very many parts, as you are simply assembling a humanoid robot. There are no bricks, just Bionicle-style robot pieces. Jimi features a unique mask and chest piece as well as his own style of cannon. The rest of the parts are shared with other Heroes and villains from the 2010 line up. The Hero Core is a very interesting piece, and was only used for the 2010 Heroes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not much to this part.... just snap together the pieces with the ball joints and then push on a couple of armor parts that feature technic push-ins.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed robot mode is stunning and features bright colors. The stock photos here on Brickset don&#39;t do it justice. The only real problem is the limited articulation due to the large covering parts. Other than that, it looks great and slightly menacing, even though Stringer is definitly a good guy!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A nice looking figure, easy build, just bad articulation. This one is hard to come by nowadays, so try and get one for cheap. I recommend this figure to any HF fan.</p>
