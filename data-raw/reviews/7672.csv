We get a catapult which shoots the balls and we also got the big clear goal. You can also put this set in this goal and there's also a part which allows you to take this set to your friends for example. The built is fun and easy and the pieces are also nice for future brickfilms and/or MOC's (My own creations) for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
