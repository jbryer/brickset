It also addresses the lack of figures and frequently sparse interiors of many LEGO homes. There are a lot of really, clever gems in this set. I really like the lawn chair and sofa.<br><br>
My biggest criticism is lack of color. The house is a predominantly stark, monochomatic theme. White bricks, white door, white fence, grey roof. Brick or sand colored bricks would add some more character. Minor changes in color could make the interior more convincing as well. I'd prefer the sofa be a dark brown, simulating leather. The gray topped end tables could be a medium brown to match the dining and coffee table. Tone down the lamp shades from vivid yellow to sand colored.<br><br>Style-wise, the City House definitely belongs with other recent City 
sets. When placed side-by-side. the City House and Creater houses, such 
as the <a href=""../../detail/?Set=4956-1"">4956 House</a>,
 don’t complement each other well. Geographically, I'm accustomed to American
 suburbs. The City House looks a little unfamiliar, but accurate. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Building experience:</span><br>This was one of the most fun builds in a long time. I didn't research the set well and as I stumbled across items, it was like getting a little bonus. Nice to build a tree with more wood and branches than the typical LEGO tree build. I'd like to add two or three more sets of leaves.<br><br>The large instruction manual had a number of pages that just added one simple part or step.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Parts:</span><br>There is an abundance of less common and unique parts in this kit. Lots of tree parts, computer screens, curved slopes, arches and sausage. Three, mini figures, two of them interesting. One's a shorter kid figure. Don't really like the female mini figure at all. There's a dog figure, but it really doesn't do much.<br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Playability:</span><br>The City House shines in playability, having a wealth of possibilities. A treehouse with telescope, skateboard, outdoor grill, fire hydrant, sidewalk, trash can, mailbox with letter, front porch, above average lawn chair, street light, solar panels, kitchen sink, stove, dining table, computer, desk and chairs, sofa, coffee table, lamps, bed, empty room, three mini figures and the dog. Whew!<br><br>The fire hydrant should come in handy if the LEGO Fire Department ever needs to save the City House and family from dad's outdoor barbecue.<br><br>The City House doesn't have a back wall, but it is more of a playset. The three floors of the house are modular and can be easily separated. This is nice, if you should have set placed flush against a wall or the back of a bookshelf and need to access the various interiors.<br><br>Additionally, the LEGO designers have designed the set for modular mixing with the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7633-1"">7633 Construction Site</a> and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7641-1"">7641 City Corner</a> sets.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Value for money:</span><br>The 8403 City House's price per piece is 25% higher than last year's <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=5891-1"">5891 Apple Tree House</a>. That's rather staggering inflation. It would be interesting to compare prices based on the weight of LEGOs per dollar.<br><br>",TRUE,3,5,5,5,2
"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-08-30T13:11:12.013Z","First City-themed house","<p>Ever since the 1990's Lego had stopped making houses for the City/Town theme. Instead, until a few years ago,&nbsp;the houses were all in the Creator line. Then this set came out, breaking the ""drought"" that was doomed for City-themed houses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, I want to comment on the main differences between this house and the Creator houses which have been released for the past few years. Creator houses are, without a doubt, larger, and their interiors are usually fairly empty. However, their main focus is the use of an abundance of bricks such that you could create many other designs with the same pieces (hence the name ""Creator""). Conversely, this set, 8403 City House, is less&nbsp;versatile for other creations&nbsp;(i.e. the use of larger pieces such as the 1x6x5 panels for the walls limits those possibilities). It is also smaller than the Creator houses, only taking up 6x16 (excluding porch) studs. On the other hand, furniture is included, which saves you the effort of making your own. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I got that out of the way, on to the review itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin with, the set includes 3 minifigures, a mother, father, and their son. The family also has a pet dog, and the kid owns a skateboard.The landscape is amazing and depicts a typical North American backyard very well. It includes a lawn chair, BBQ grill with sausage(!), round tree, arch way, and tree fort. The tree fort has a spyglass and a flag, and this is clearly where the kid would hang out. In front of the house is a street lamp, mailbox with mail, garbage can, and flower. There is a sidewalk that spans the entire length of the baseplate (the sidewalk is made of new 2x4 flat tiles). Down the sidewalk from the house, there is a small fence with a fire hydrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The house has many exterior details such as a front porch, address, awning, arches, gutter, solar panels, and chimney. I like how there are stairs leading up to the porch and the railing used. Like I said before, the overall design of the house might be simpler as opposed to Creator houses, but here I like how much attention was paid to the house's exterior details. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we enter the main floor of the house, it is the kitchen area. Here, there is a sink, stove top with cabinet underneath, dining table, chairs, cups, frying pan, and small TV (it is a computer screen but meant to be a TV). The 2x4 plate used for the table top is a nice, rare maple colour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second floor of the house is the living area. Here, there is a computer, sofa, table (same 2x4 maple-coloured plate), wine glasses, and a small table with a lamp. The table in front of the sofa is designed such that whoever's sitting there can rest their feet on there, which is clever. You can add your own TV up here but due to the layout of the furniture, it is quite difficult to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attic (third floor) is where the bedroom is. Here, there is simply a bed and a small table with a lamp (exact same one from the second floor). A drawer would've been a nice touch. There is also a small, empty room beside that bedroom. You can either make this area a (very) small bedroom for the kid (he is able to fit on a 2x4 bed), or you can make it a bathroom, with a toilet and sink. Actually, I'm glad this little room was included, because I can decide what to put in there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember the modular buildings from 7633 Construction Site and 7641 City Corner? Well apparently, along with the house in this set, you can mix and match the individual floors from any of the 3 modular buildings, since they are all 6x16 studs in terms of dimension. This interesting feature is shown on the back of the set's box. However, it looks a bit strange and I rather I didn't do that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is an excellent set and I recommend it to any City fan. At $54.99 CAD it is a reasonable buy. It is great how Lego is beginning to release sets like these, because the emergency line is starting to get a bit old and tiresome. In my opinion, sets like 7641 City Corner and 8403 City House are the exact kind of sets that re-kindle interest in Lego. My message to Lego: variety is what people need and this set is a giant step towards reaching that goal.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"meyerc13","2010-11-07T18:04:35.797Z","Perfect set for Girls (and boys!)","What a great set!&nbsp; From the moment I saw pictures of this set, I knew I wanted to add it to the Lego City my children and I are slowly building.&nbsp; The set includes a three story white house with gray roof, blue awning, and front deck, along with a small yard.<br><br>On the outside, we have one of the new streetlights, perfect for servicing by your 3179 Repair Truck.&nbsp; We also have a mailbox and recycling bin, which is great if you have older sets like the 7991 Recycle Truck or the 7731 Mail Van.&nbsp; Let's not forget the fire hydrant, so your Lego Fire Fighters can come to the rescue when the Dad in this set starts the tree house on fire while using the backyard grill.&nbsp; The outside is rounded out with a skateboard for the little boy and a chair for dad to recline on.<br><br>On the inside, we have three floors.&nbsp; The first floor is a kitchen, complete with sink, stovetop, and table/chairs.&nbsp; The second floor is a living room with couch, end table, lamp, coffee table, and computer desk/chair.&nbsp; The third floor has a bedroom with a small bed and side table with lamp, and a second smaller room without furniture.&nbsp; All of these details add a ton of play value, my 3 year old daughter played for hours after I built the set.<br><br>The set does have a few small flaws.&nbsp; The most annoying is the wall panels used on the first floor walls.&nbsp; Much like my own stove which seems to collect all manner of oddities behind it, with the stove against a hollow wall panel both my daughter and I managed to lose something behind the stove in the first 5 minutes of play (the frying pan and sausage respectively).&nbsp; That will have to be fixed by replacing the wall panels with a brick built wall.&nbsp; <br><br>One other annoyance, the wall behind the yard doesn't attach to the building.&nbsp; This is both a plus in that it allows you to more easily transplant the building from the included plate to a road plate if you so choose, but it also means that it is easy to knock the wall off the base plate.<br><br>There are also a few pieces of furniture noticeably missing - Where's the TV?&nbsp; Is the computer screen on the kitchen wall supposed to be a TV?&nbsp; Why not include a blank tile and TV sticker like in the 7639 camper or the 7208 fire station?&nbsp; The bed only holds one, so I guess dad will sleep on the couch.&nbsp; And I don't think there's a fridge, unless it's under the stovetop, but I think that's the oven or a cabinet.&nbsp; Let's not even talk about the missing bathroom.&nbsp; I can excuse many of these because clearly this is a cross section of the house so perhaps those parts are in the other side of the house that we don't have in this box (time to create it ourselves!).<br><br>In any case, these are minor complaints easily fixed, and fixing them would have probably driven up the price of the set - and sitting on the shelf the $40 seems a bit high for a house.&nbsp; However, once you put this set together, you'll see that the kids will have as much fun playing with this as they do the much more expensive sets.&nbsp; As I've said multiple times above, my daughter has taken to this set more than she has to any other set we own so far, so I *highly* recommend this set if you have a little girl who you want to introduce to LEGO.<br><br>One final thing, there's some misinformation in the other reviews.&nbsp; Someone thought the boy's torso had a surgical mask - that's a hooded sweatshirt!&nbsp; Someone also said the set was $59USD, cut $20 off that price.<br><br>Overall, this is a great set and it's great to have another civilian set in my LEGO City along with the City Corner.&nbsp; LEGO - please give us more!<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"SgtSmash","2010-09-22T15:13:51.253Z","Spendy little place","Thought I'd make a quick review of the City House, the first of what will hopefully be more homes for wayward Lego City citizens.&nbsp;While the Creator houses are nice, this set seems to fit more in line&nbsp;with the&nbsp;Lego City sets, and at least comes with a family to live in it.&nbsp;The house is nice, and was fun to build.&nbsp;You get the mom, dad,&nbsp;boy and their pet dog. It appears to be&nbsp;somewhat similar to the Pizza shop that comes with the City Corner set, as it is about the same height and base footprint.&nbsp;Not a whole heck of a lot of room inside the house, but there is a kitchen, living room, computer stand and&nbsp;upstairs bedroom. This is more or less a Japanese apartment but multi-level. &nbsp;The outside of the home features a BBQ grill, mailbox, garbage can, street light, and tree house with binoculars. A nice touch is the reclining chair out front.&nbsp;Not quite sure why Lego had the boy come with the surgical mask outfit...is he sick? Does he have breathing problems from the smog? Hard to say. &nbsp;A problem I continuously have is where to put these houses. I&nbsp;have a few Creator homes and I would prefer not to put them smack in the middle of town. I have&nbsp;some road plates heading out to a neighborhood area, but I only have so much room! &nbsp;The&nbsp;biggest stumbling block, in my opinion, is the price. At $39.99 USD, you hardly get your money's worth.&nbsp;As is, I'd say&nbsp;$29.99 and even that is pushing it. Otherwise, there should have been&nbsp;a&nbsp;garage with a family station wagon or something included. That's just me.&nbsp;It's a ""Special Edition"" set,&nbsp;so not sure if that justifies it,&nbsp;I don't know. Again, this is just my opinion.",FALSE,4,3,4,4,2
"beegeedee","2010-09-23T09:10:48.747Z","Fantastic value for money","The City House is a nice change away from vehicle sets - I have loads of those and want some buildings for my city. The problem is that most of the buildings are expensive but this was an absolute steal at 36.99 Euro (normally around 44.99 in Euro-land).<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Box Contents</span><br>There are 4 bags in the box as well as the 16x32 base board and 3 smaller boards used for each level of the house. Three of the bags are for each of the house levels and a 4th covers the exterior of the house. Each of these bags have smaller bags for the small parts making it well organised and easy to find the pieces.<br><br>The first bag includes 3 minifigures with accessories and also a dog but unfortunately one has short legs - I assume it is meant to be a child. The female minifgure is a new design and I've not seen this in any other sets which is a plus. The box, according to LEGO, features 383 pieces but actually contains 397 including the spares. There's also a sticker sheet for the solar panels in the roof. There are 11 spares in the box for the smaller pieces (1x1 tiles and plates, extra flower head etc) and the flower heads are counted as one since they are joined together and have to be separated which makes up for the 14 piece difference. One thing to note is the instructions states there are 5 flowers but there are only 4 in the box.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Assembly and Instructions</span><br>The instruction book is 84 pages (including cover etc) and is split into 4 sections, one for each of the bags. The house is straight forward to assemble but the best part is putting together the garden which is a lot of fun with all the little details such as a barbeque, mail box and sun lounger. The whole model takes an hour at a leisurely pace to put together, less if you just want to play -&nbsp; kid would probably take a couple of hours or more depending on their age and skill level.<br><br>Each level of the house can be easily detached for storage and quick reassembly.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Play Factor</span><br>The back of the house levels are open so it is easy to put the figures in. with a kitchen level, a lounge level and even a bed in the attic there's fun to be had. There's only a few small minifig accessories included - a hot dog, a couple of mugs, a letter, a frying pan and also 2 glasses.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall</span><br>Pros: Inexpensive building to add to your City collection. Nice box and a few handy spares. Easy to build for the younger audience. Looks great once assembled.<br>Cons: 1 minifig has short legs. Lack of minifig accessories (exra hot dog, perhaps a book for the sun lounger, a bone for the dog etc would have been nice)<br><br>Still, these are minor and can't fault the set.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Doctor_Leg_O_Brick","2010-09-25T04:53:11.953Z","fantastic on every level","<p>I got this as a birthday present, and i've still got that big grin on my face since i saw it complete. What an amazing set!</p>
<p>THE BUILD</p>
<p>Very, very good. It keeps you hooked for the time you are building it. It has a 82 page book to build the house (83 if you include the parts list). To make it more fun, lego has made it so it can be mixed with 7641 and&nbsp;7633&nbsp;(shop only)&nbsp;in any way you like it. This is&nbsp;because all the buildings are 6 studs long and 16 studs wide. It includes 3 stickers which i don't mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PARTS</p>
<p>Again, fantastic. You get a rare marple colour 4x2 plate, flowers, a tree, a new green bin, railings, a new lamp, a bed, a cooker, sink, tv, computer, sofa, 3 cairs,&nbsp;letter box&nbsp;with letter, tree house with telescope and flag, a lamp post, barbecue, loads of windows, lawn chair, cups, wine glasses, new 2x4 flat plates,&nbsp;house number, solor panels and&nbsp;a&nbsp;gutter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PLAYABILITY</p>
<p>Their is no end to the amount of playability with the family and the dog. It fits right into any city,&nbsp;the&nbsp;list of&nbsp;playablity is just endless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE MINIFIGURES</p>
<p>You get a Mom, a Dad, a kid and his dog.&nbsp;The dog is the same brown one in police sets, the mom has green legs,&nbsp;has the same body as the 8970 girl, same hair as Irina spalko and same&nbsp;mold as&nbsp;Dyna-mite. The&nbsp;Dad has the same hair as agent case,&nbsp;the magician and the man from 3177 small car. His body is in 7641 and 30012, and his legs are just plain white. The kid&nbsp;has the the new torso that first appeared in 2010 in&nbsp;3177, his head is new as well with a big grin and spots with ginger hair. His has some short stuby legs that are common for lego kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE MONEY </p>
<p>Great for £30 GBP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OVERALL RATING</p>
<p>You have to give it a 5, a most have for city collectors.</p>

For the average LEGO family, the choices are not appealing: perhaps one could hole up in the back of a delivery truck (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3221-1"">3221</a>), get arrested and perhaps spend some time in one of the city’s numerous jails, or one could stay out in the streets and take shelter beneath makeshift structures cannibalised from sets that are no longer a part of your display. Basically, it’s a hard life.</div><div><br></div><div>The family in City House, then, is the luckiest family your LEGO City, and how they deal with this good fortune may or may not say a lot about you as a person: will they share their massive superstructure with their less fortunate neighbours, forced to sleep on the streets and beneath their cars, or will they bar their gates and post armed guards on every corner, like what I did with mine (the mummified minions from Golden Staff Guardians (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7306-1"">7306</a>) proved to be especially helpful here)? These three Minifigs could very well end up being the Mr. Potter and family of your town display, and none of them are really of particular note save for the mother Minifig, who sports an unusual fifties-style haircut as opposed to the typical ponytail hairpiece that distinguishes most female Minifigs. They’re a functional family, but you won’t find this set lacking in Minifigs if you have even one other town set to augment this domestic scene.</div><div><br></div><div>The meat-and-potatoes of City House is, well, the house, and what a house it is. Occupying a plot of land equivalent to that which the airport terminal (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3182-1"">3182</a>) sits on and standing higher than the two-storey pizzeria featured in City Corner (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7641-1"">7641</a>), City House is likely to be the largest and most imposing structure in your town, and I don’t really know why this surprised me as much as it did since a cursory glance at the box is probably more than enough to confirm this fact, but it did. I meant for this to supplement by city display, but it ended up dominating it. Mr. Potter’s front yard is now a public park.</div><div><br></div><div>The apartment does feature a number of very rich details, though, including a kitchen, a dining room, and a place in the attic to stick the kid when he doesn’t eat his broccoli. Outside, you’ll find a lovely porch, a curious deckchair for lounging around in, and a cool treehouse that may fit one or two more fellow LEGO citizens if they don’t mind being a little intimate in exchange for having a place to call their own. The dollhouse-like details will extend the build time, but it’s overall pretty easy and uncomplicated enough that even a total novice to LEGO will be able to complete in a short time, I imagine.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The final decision you’ll have to make is the direction that you’ll want City House to face, an agonising problem endemic to all city buildings. If you have its front towards you, you’ll lose all the cute details on the inside of the house, but if you have its back facing you, its front porch and yard will feel largely inaccessible. If you’re not concerned about things like that, however, you’ll find that City House is a very nice set that you’re bound to have loads of fun with, and its relatively simple build and design will offer a loose sense of nostalgia. If you already have a city display or intend to start one, this would be a good place to go. Give your LEGO people a home: invest in a City House today.</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,3
