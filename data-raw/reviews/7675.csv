<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been eyeing up this set since news broke of it on here ages ago. Spotted the news message on here about free postage at lego shop wotsit, so I shot over to check out the set and BOOM! Spied the price tag of £80!<strong> SERIOUSLY?</strong> I was expecting to pay £40 ish, maybe a little more but £80 is just obscene!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes The bus is excellent, yes the tram is lovely, but I know I can pick up a road sweeper and a sportscar for £5 each and the actual platforms, well, they aint all that and a bag of potato chips, to be fair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this review is permitted. I know it's not much, but I think it's about time lego caught up with themselves a bit here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps selling the coach and the tram as seperate sets might prove to be a more prudent and fruitful option?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours, an unhappy camper.</p>

"Krogh","2010-10-03T17:55:58.28Z","Worth the price, or waste of money?","<p>So, i just picked up this set today, and i must say, that the price is insanely high, considering it's meant for children. I know of no parents, that will spend this amount on a gift for their children, at least not in the form of a plastic toy, this is more for dad, than for the kids, and it seems to be the way lego city is headed these days, and that's sad.<br><br>I wouldn't have picked it up, but i got a little bonus from work, and found it at a local toys r us. I thought about it for a good 10 minutes, i knew i wanted it, and i knew i didn't want to pay the way to high price, but it has been some time since a bought a lego product, so i finally convinced myself to get it. So, was it worth the price, well, lets take a look at the set. I'll split the review up and talk about the individual parts. First the 3 ""stations"".</p><p><br></p><p><b>Tram station:<br><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">Calling this a station is a stretch, to say the least. And that goes for the entire set. For the duration of this review, let's just call it a stop. There's really not much to say, it looks great when finished, except it seems a bit tall, it'll look a bit off in your city, seeing as it's 2 stories tall. This is to accomidate the tram, wich is allso fairly tall. It features street lights, wich i think is a nice detail, and these help me overcome the tall construction. Another little detail is the ticket computer.<br><br><b>Bus stop:<br><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">A standard bus stop, with an odd design, as it has one rounded side roof, and one strait side. A nice little detail is the bike stand, and here's one of the big plusses to this set, the green bike. We also have a recycle bin standing on this platform. The bus stop features nice lego city signs, and a bus stop schedule.<br><br><b>Souvenir shop:<br><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">The last platform is a small shop, there's not much more than a coffee machine, and a stand with some postcards. Oddly enough my set was missing a sticker for one of the postcards. There's a recycle bin, a postbox, and a map of the city.</span></b></span></b></span></b></p><p><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br></span></b></span></b></span></b></p><p><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Sports car:<br></b>So, iv'e seen some peaople say that it's the same car as the </span>8402 Sports car<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">, and that's not the case, it's not even close. :) it might look scimilar, but the design and pieces used, are not the same at all. Besides, all the newer smaller cars are pretty much built on the same basic frame. It's always nice to have another sportscar racing around your city, though. It looks great, but i still can't understand why the wheels have to stick way out. All in all, it's a fairly standard, but nice little sportscar.</span></b></span></b></span></b></p><p><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br></span></b></span></b></span></b></p><p><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>City sweeper:</b></span></b></span></b></span></b></p><p>Now, this is actually one of the primary reasons why i got this set. I am collecting, or, at least, trying to collect all the lego city trucks, so, i guess i'd have to get this sooner or later. Unfortunatly, i am somewhat disappointed by this truck. My primary complaint: It's just to short. It's the same length, as the yellow sports car. Otherwise, it's a very simple truck. The brooms are a nice touch though. The driver is positioned on the right side, not the left, some say this is a mistake, but my theory is, that in real life, it would be a lot easier to follow the sidewalk closely, when sitting on the right. Anyway, it's a funny little truck, and a nice variaty from the <b>7242 street sweeper</b>.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Tour bus:<br><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">Here we have the star of the show, at least in my opinion. I saw this bus back when the first photos were leaked, i had JUST bought the </span>7641 City Corner<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">, and this tour bus just seemed like such a step up from the yellow city bus. And that's exactly what it turned out to be. The look, the design, the use of pieces, it's all just awesome! This, and this alone makes this set worth getting. It features (Besides the awesome look!) 6 seats, and a drivers seat, doors on both sides of the bus, removable roof, and 2 storage compartments, on each side of the bus. This, is lego city at it's finest.<br><br><b>Tram:<br><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am not an expert on trains or trams, and as of the time of this review, i have no experience in lego trains, so i might not know entirely what i am talking about here. ;)<br>The tram has a nice look, but, how is one suposed to enter the middle car? There must be invisible doors between the cars. :) I think it's a bit to tall, but i can accept it, since it's designed to run on overhanging wires. As i understand it, the tram will fit on standard lego train tracks.</span></b></span></b></p><p><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br></span></b></span></b></p><p><b><b>Minifigs:<br><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">The set contains 6 minifigs, a female driver for the sports car, a driver for the tram, a driver for the bus, a driver for the sweeper, and 2 civilians, one of wich, is equipped with a suitcase.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was looking forward to this set when I first saw the news release about it.&nbsp; When I saw the initial price of $139.99 I was a bit hesitant, but I'm glad I endulged!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The engineering of this set and the parts included are wonderful!&nbsp; The tram, which fits on the 9V/remote tracks fit well within the CITY style.&nbsp; The tour bus is an AWESOME design with a great use of pieces.&nbsp; The sports car, street sweeper and platforms are super additions to the set.&nbsp; The sticker set creates some nice touches to the atmosphere.&nbsp; AND THERE'S A GREEN BIKE!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"SgtSmash","2010-09-08T17:17:25.253Z","A lot of stuff for a lot of money!","I was a bit leary&nbsp;paying $99 USD for a set that didn't appear to be&nbsp;more than&nbsp;5&nbsp;vehicles and a light rail train with no tracks, 6 minifigs and some&nbsp;kiosk-type buildings with no baseplate to put them on. But after breaking down and buying this set,&nbsp;I&nbsp;was amazed at just how big this set really is (8 bags of parts!), the time it took me to build, and how it incorporated into my Lego city.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>For the better part of an afternoon I spent assembling all of this stuff, and it really was a lot of fun doing so. Even if you have a small Lego city collection, this set instantly makes your town&nbsp;larger and includes vehicles/equipment you won't find anywhere else. All of this equipment fits comfortably on&nbsp;a separate large grey baseplate,&nbsp;which is what I did...but&nbsp;even if you were to scatter the kiosks around your town wherever they'd fit, there is still an amazing amount of play value. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>You got your yellow sportscar, which is more or less an offshoot of the red ""sports car"" set with a couple extra touches...a really cool street cleaning vehicle, the HUGE bus, and of course the light rail train itself.&nbsp;The kiosks also&nbsp;have some really neat touches, such as the postcard stand, snack area, recycle bins and mailbox, plus a rare green bicycle with bike rack. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>My daughter absolutely loves the light rail and drives it around town with no tracks, but I guess&nbsp;with Lego sometimes&nbsp;you just have to use your imagination. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>One other set I got at the same time with an additional large grey baseplate is the new Train Station #7937-1. This all fits together great, and while I do not have any of the new train sets yet (afraid to spend even more money for trains, tracks, crossings...etc.), the light rail can rest on the 4 pcs of supplied track, and it looks like a huge transportation hub. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>All in all, a great set, and while a bit spendy, really does add to your town and is a lot of fun to build.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

<p><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText></SPAN>&nbsp;</p>
<P class=BVRRReviewTextParagraph><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText><strong>Minifigures:<br/></strong>Great additions to the set. There is a bus driver with standard back hair and the normal black and white sleeves suit. There is also the Tram conductor, which is pretty cool since he has a black suit and a black police hat. Next there is the driver for the Street Sweeper, which is my favorite minifigure in the set. The street sweeper guy has orange pants and a blue and orange top. There is a girl in the yellow sports car, which is good since girls are very hard to find in Lego form. Then there is some guy with long hair that goes with the GREEN bike. Lastly, there is a guy in a green shirt and blue pants with glasses on.<br/><em>Minifigures: 5/5.</em></SPAN></p>

<DIV class=BVRRReviewTextParagraph><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText><strong>Platforms:</strong></SPAN><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText><br/>Not that great. Kinda wimpy and large. The shop platform is very small and cramped. The platform with the bike ramp is pathetic except for the glass part with stops and times. The best platform is the one with blue window pieces on top, since its small and has a simple but cool-looking design.<br/><em>Platforms: 4/5.</em></SPAN></DIV>

<DIV class=BVRRReviewTextParagraph><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText><strong>Vehicles:</strong></SPAN><SPAN class=BVRRReviewText><br/>The reason why I wanted this set. First there is the yellow sports car. The yellow car is kinda lame, and much to similiar to the red sport car. Next there is the Street Sweeper, which as and awesome design. I like the orange color and the back design. However, the front area where the driver sits is empty and small. The Tram is the longest vehicle and has a repetitive design. The back is eaxactly the same as the front, but the tram is still cool. I know there is some way to put a motor in the Tram to make it move atomatically. Anyway, the tram also has a TON of stickers, but I'll get into that later. Finally, my favorite part of the set, the Bus. Some people complain about the Bus, but I don't see any huge problems with it. It has a lot of space for a total of NINE minifigures and has little storage areas on the outside. The overall design of the Bus is nothing that I've seen before, and very fun to build. The only problem I can see is that some hair doesn't fit under the roof very well.<br/><em>Vehicles: 5/5.</em></SPAN></DIV>

There is only one part that doesn't have stickers and thats the platform with the blue windows on top. Also, the price is a little high. I would have definately bought it on sale, but maybe not at its regular price. The price would have been reasonable if all the stickers were printed bricks. Overall, its still a great set, and I suggest you buy it if you can afford it. <em>I rate it 9/10 overall.</em></SPAN></DIV>

"stagus","2011-08-31T05:53:27.887Z","Great city addition","<p>I am reviewing this as an AFOL with a fairly large city layout going on in my loft.&nbsp; This set is an excellent addition to my city but I would question it as a standalone set which is why I am giving it 4 out 5.&nbsp; It is a fun build with a couple of unusual pieces of design (they are blinking clever at Lego I tell you!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transport</p>
<p>The tram is very cool and cleverly done with a 'floating' axle underneath to allow the tram to go on corner rails.&nbsp;Standard blue&nbsp;in the main with a few stickers.</p>
<p>The bus is my favourite piece in the set.&nbsp; I love the fact that the driver is set lower than the seats, just like&nbsp;real buses you see on the road.&nbsp; Fab colour.&nbsp; Just a beautiful vehicle.</p>
<p>The road sweeper is cool an looks fab.&nbsp; Nice brushes for the road and a nice squat design.</p>
<p>Not sure that the sports car is public transport but it looks good none the less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building are ok.&nbsp; The glass roofed bus/tram terminal is really nice.&nbsp; I have it stationed in my city such that you can get the tram on one side and buses on the other.&nbsp; The other bus stop is fairly basic although the bike rack is a nice touch.&nbsp; The wee kiosk is pretty cool with coffee and a postcard stand.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The bus is magnificent 
<li>Cool tram 
<li>Will fit with anyones city 
<li>Nice set of minifigs</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>More limited playability if you don't have other lego. 
<li>Quite expensive. 
<li></li></ul>
<p>Overall this is a good set if a bit pricey (over £80 in the uk) but I would recomend it to any city builders and any parents willing to splash this much on a box of Lego for their kids as they will have a lot of fun with the vehicles.&nbsp; Hope this helps!</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"av8r1973","2011-01-14T05:45:31.63Z","Adds content to your city, but not much on its own","This set just looked too cool not to get. &nbsp;We have a fairly large metropolis set up in our living room and this adds some great impact to it. &nbsp;With 7 unique components, it should have been called something like ""City Infrastructure"", not ""Public Transport"".<div><br></div><div>After running through the brick ratings here, I realized I rated it pretty low. &nbsp;I realized why. This really is a nice set. &nbsp;Unfortunately, nothing really stands out. &nbsp;The build experience was completely standard, except for two specifics noted below. &nbsp;The parts were all standard, as well (except one noted below). &nbsp;The price was pretty high, but the part count was high as well. &nbsp;Just not remarkable as a set.</div><div><br></div><div>On to the good stuff, presented in order of my favorite components of the kit.</div><div><br></div><div>Bus: This bus is cool. &nbsp;The lime green was &nbsp;bold move, but is pretty muted compared to most of the tour buses on the road here in Taiwan. &nbsp;It is very realistic! &nbsp;The solid glass passenger compartment, luggage boxes underneath, plethora of tail lights and tall mirrors represent the real tour bus or over the road coaches seen around the world. &nbsp;Nice job. &nbsp;The lime green gave me some elements in a color just not seen much in LEGO. I would have been happy to be able to purchase this bus as a standalone kit!</div><div><br></div><div>Street Train: The train is a 3-part unit that strongly resembles street trains in a lot of major US and European cities today. &nbsp;Sleek, modern, enclosed wheels, etc... &nbsp;The colors were nicely done and the tall skinny shape is very realistic. &nbsp;Sliding doors would have been a nice addition, but it would have added a lot of complexity. &nbsp;One cool building technique is the sliding axle on the middle car that lets it navigate curves in the track easily. &nbsp;It slides back and forth very nicely and was a clever touch. &nbsp;A new element for me was the front and rear windows. &nbsp;Not sure where else I could use them, but they look great. &nbsp;Disappointed there wasn't any provision to add motors. &nbsp;Just need to push it around my track.</div><div><br></div><div>Sweeper Truck: Not real original here, but i's a nice looking truck. &nbsp;The newer orange theme is a good color in my city and the blue sweeper elements are neat. &nbsp;The second cool build technique is the floating sweepers on the truck. &nbsp;They flex easily over the dirt on the carpet, so it looks pretty cool to me. &nbsp;The exhaust stack isn't very stable behind the cab - I am going to have to reengineer that.</div><div><br></div><div>Stops: Included are a separate bus stop that is all standard bricks. &nbsp;It came with a green bike, so that was nice. &nbsp;The bike rack was a nice touch. &nbsp;The train station was pretty standard, but the overhead glass elements added a crisp, modern look to it.</div><div><br></div><div>Sports Car: &nbsp;A standard yellow 4-lug wide car was included. &nbsp;Not sure why, since this is a ""public"" transport set. &nbsp;It's a nice little convertible that will still go nicely in my city.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall - it's a great set to add multiple elements to your city. &nbsp;Standalone, it may not do too much, since most of the units don't have much detail on their own. &nbsp;Put them in a city setting and you get a lot of impact for not too much money.</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4

"RichieBitchy","2021-01-11T18:36:39.66Z","One of the Best City Sets of Its Time","<p>I remember when this set came out when I was about 9 or 10. It was a must-have since I had a whole train setup and display. Needless to say, this set did not disappoint. I would recommend it for any parent looking to give their kid lots of play value, for any collector looking to capture Lego City in its prime, or for any city builder looking for more detail and value to add to their display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set features an entourage of unique vehicles that were not regularly released at the time for the City subtheme. The Tram of course paralleled the Trains theme that was re-released around the same time. The coach bus was certainly unique. The street sweeper had a few iterations previously, and the yellow sports car of course is a great addition.</p>

<p>The tram station is really modern and sleek looking, but otherwise not much to write home about. I think my favourite part of this set as a kid was the little travel kiosk. No other set had featured something like that that offered a lot of depth and playability to the city streets. It features a transit map, a coffee maker, and a swivelling postcard stand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The little bus stop was neat as well, with the bike rack and bench. At the time, Lego bikes were almost always red. This one came with a green bike, which added some much-needed variety. You also get a great cast of unique figures. Maybe could have done with one more, but six is still a decent amount.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only gripe I had about this set was that it featured no tracks for the tram. I figured for 100USD, the least they could do was add a small oval-worth of track. But I had a train setup so it didn&#39;t matter much to me. This is the only reason I give a &quot;value for money&quot; rating a 4 instead of a 5.</p>

<p>Overall, a great set to own and definitely one worth scouring eBay or Bricklinks for.</p>
