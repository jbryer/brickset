"jackmap","2010-07-04T15:02:50.573Z","Now this is one awesome set!","<p>This set is very similar to 3221 and the truck and trailer are pretty much the same, except for a different color scheme. However, it is a Toys R Us exclusive set, therefore,&nbsp;it contains never-before seen brick elements, such as the blue wheel covers and the exclusive Toys R Us stickers. The three minifigures included match perfectly with the set's theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the store itself,&nbsp;it may be small, but again, don't judge a Lego set by it's box art. The store itself includes magnificent detail, especially a cash register that can take your customer's orders&nbsp;and&nbsp;even two&nbsp;walls hanging inside it for displaying various toys. Besides just the Lego set boxes, there&nbsp;is also a toy car, hovercraft, sword, gun,&nbsp;and even a teddy bear. While the teddy bear itself, doesn't latch onto the Lego brick elements. It can fit in perfectly with the cart that is included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For an original price of $39.99, this is definately a must-have set if you are building a Lego city or just to add for your collection!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros</li>
<li>Very nicely detailed</li>
<li>Very rare elements included</li>
<li>Nice new exclusive color scheme</li>
<li>Perfect value for money</li>

<p>I hope that Lego has more exclusives like this in the future!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

My brother got a Prince Of Persia set. I saw behind a couple of other boxes, a nice looking set. i was shocked to find it to be the truck. It is definitely the rarest set.

"PluffTed","2010-07-28T22:28:23.577Z","Toys R Us does it again!","<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>I got this set by going&nbsp;to my local Toys R Us in San Diego, CA.&nbsp; They had just gotten a shipment, so there were quite a few there.&nbsp; It is exactly the same as the 3221 Lego Truck, but it is a repaint, has new characters, and includes a mini Toys R Us shop!&nbsp; Kind of expensive though at $39.99!</p>
<h4>Review</h4>
<p>I'll start out with the truck first.&nbsp; The truck I believe has a way better paint than the 3221 Lego Truck.&nbsp; I think the blue is&nbsp;way better&nbsp;compared to the yellow 3221 paint.&nbsp; Inside the cabin, there is a driver's chair, table to put the driver's coffee mug, a bed, and a TV.&nbsp; I have both this set and the 3221 Lego truck, so I think that the truck's cab has an awesome interior!&nbsp; </p>
<p>The only 2 complaints I have about the truck is that the pieces that connect the trailer and cab together like to fall off a lot.&nbsp; The 2nd complaint is that the 4 tires on the back of the trailer have some sort of suspension that's really loose which kind of annoys me.</p>
<p>The last thing to talk about is the Toys R Us mini shop.&nbsp; I absolutely love the shop because of so many things!&nbsp; One is that the outside really resembles a real life Toys R Us shop.&nbsp; The 2nd is that I love how the interior is built!&nbsp; There is a very nicely designed shelf that can hold the 3 Lego boxes.&nbsp; There's a nice cash register with a computer and a barrel full of toy weapons!&nbsp; There's also a shelf that can hold the toy car and boat.&nbsp; You can put the teddy bear wherever you want, but I made the little boy holding it.</p>

"Superbrick555","2010-08-05T10:18:37.63Z","Watch out the TRU truck is coming for you","<p>I got this set at toys r us a few weeks ago. It was the first time I saw it and I knew it would be fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Truck</strong></p>
<p>The Truck is my favorite out of this set. It has nice stickers. Steps to get&nbsp;up to the driver seat. You can lift up the top and there is a driving seat and a bed. There is also smoke stacks and mirrors.&nbsp;But there is always cons.&nbsp;1st some times&nbsp;the front bumper and lights fall out. 2nd the hitch to the truck come of 99% of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Trailer</strong></p>
<p>The Trailer falls apart a lot the whells and the bumper fell off multiple time while I was playing with it. What&nbsp;I like about it was the dolly the packages&nbsp; the trailer stops and the stickers. The sticker made it look like a real truck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Store</strong></p>
<p>The store was my least favorite. First of all it is way to small Lego should have made it bigger and raise it to 50.00 I would have bought it for 50.00 if the store was bigger. On the topic there was no playibilty in the store every time you touch something it would fall apart. The store lady should have toys r us cloth not the outfit she has on </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall </strong>This set was not good or bad I give a 2 out of 5 </p>

"MilkyBarKid","2010-11-06T08:40:29.713Z","New store opens!","<p>As soon as I saw this set I knew that I had to have it to expand my town.&nbsp; It is not often that LEGO provides us with something other than another Police or Fire set so this is a definite must have.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Store</h4>
<p>With the recent lack of any new shops or services added to the City range this set is worth it for the Toys R Us store alone.&nbsp; The store itself is full of excellent details such as a cash register, shelves, toys and LEGO boxes.&nbsp; My only complaint about the store is the size, ideally it would be a bit bigger but having a slightly small Toys R Us store is better than having none at all.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>The Truck</h4>
<p>Like the store, the Toys R Us truck looks great against everything else in the City range because of its blue and white colours.&nbsp; This makes the truck stand out especially the blue front cab and roof.&nbsp; The storeage area with opening doors is great for playabilty where you can deliver toys to the store.&nbsp; My favourite part of the truck is the actual cab.&nbsp; Firstly I love the colour and shape of the front, the high grill at the front make the truck very special for me as it looks so realistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advice is to snap this up before it goes as it is a much needed addition to the LEGO City Corner set.&nbsp; There is plenty of playability with this set not to mention it is extremely rare to have a LEGO Toys R Us store.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"brickford","2010-12-23T12:43:12.52Z","The type of set we need more of","<p>Up until recently, Lego had avoided issuing non-emergency services building sets. Whilst I appreciate rights/brands etc and the legal problems those might bring, this limited edition Toys R Us set is a real breeze of fresh air and I'm glad that they made it.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, the shop is fantastic - great minifigs, neat checkout and a good range of toys in stock - including those superb Lego Lego sets. The colours, economic use of the gray 8x16 baseplate space and the branded stickers make this shop look absolutely perfect. No wonder the little boy minifig has an undecided expression - he just can't decide which toy to have first!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reservations over the truck though. To be honest, I would have preferred to have just bought the shop on its own with, at most, a small delivery van. The truck is far too long in my opinion and the residents and shoppers in my town of Brickford are already complaining about this monster trying to squeeze down the busy High Street to deliver items.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, I'd have made the cab of the truck half as long as it is (like the one in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7733-1"">7733-1 Truck &amp; Forklift</a>), and the trailer about 2/3rds of the length it is as that truck could probably swallow the shop twice over!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a great set, but the truck really put me in two minds over buying it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"AETerry","2011-04-16T23:23:06.18Z","Toys R Us City Truck Review","<p>ZOMG! This set came out in 2010 as a promo exclusive set between LEGO and Toys R Us and I thought for sure with having moved into 2011, I would have missed my opportunity to get ahold of this set!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made a trip into the closest Toys R Us to me for another reason and taking a look down the Lego aisle, I found this sitting on the shelf and knew I had to pick it up. And I am not disappointed. For one, it offers up a little store front area to populate in a Lego City beyond the Emergency centers. The store front build was similiar to the City Corner set and those buildings, I loved the mini builds for toy cars and remote control vehicles, those were clever. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three minifigures, the truck driver, cashier and an uncommon child character make up the set and add to a Lego City population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to the truck itself, I had a lot of fun building and putting this together, there's another truck set I'd like to get that's yellow. But this being blue, I just enjoyed it and the interior details inside for where the trucker sleeps at and computer. The trailer is huge and spacious for loading up lego cargo onto it. I did make a slight modification to the design of the truck where there's a grey cylinder piece sticking out on the side... I modified the side that you can't see in the picture well enough so it would symetrical in appearance and not lop sided to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I've just really enjoyed this set. I know there can be hang ups with the liscensings and designs... but I love seeing them such as this set to create more a real world feel to the set and not quite so generic. That might be silly, but there's a point where it's fun to see some of it. I'll certainly complain if it gets to ever feeling over done.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"coldcomfort","2011-01-28T02:03:59.247Z","7848 Toys R Us City Truck - Maybe the best Lego truck set ever.","<p>I am a former long haul truck driver that hauled both flat bed and modified trailers and 53' box trailers (or ""vans"" as we drivers call them) during my career. This set caught my eye because the tractor is a dead ringer for a Volvo - a very popular, dependable and (in my humble opinion) attractive model. The tractor is, of course, identical to the one in the 3221 set which I saw first and nearly bought instead, but I happened to have a gift card for Toys R Us and they weren't currently offering the 3221 set when I redeemed it. I didn't think I would care for the store and the 78 additional pieces did not seem to justify the $15 US price increase from set 3221 to this one. However, once I had it in hand and built it my tune changed significantly.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The tractor and trailer are truly impressively designed. The resemblance of the tractor to a popular and dependable real world workhorse adds a strong note of authenticity to the Lego city line. Additionally, as a former trucker I will add a note regarding the trailer's suspension which somebody else mentioned in a review as being ""loose."" Real 53' vans generally have a type of suspension called Air Ride which uses a series of hydraulically controlled bushings to dampen the blows of driving down the highway. The tandems (wheels) on these trailers actually move and behave in the real world incredibly similarly to how the wheels on this model do. Personally, I found this detail absolutely astounding and the inventiveness of the designers of this piece actually made me laugh out loud when I built it.<br></li><li>This tractor and trailer are based on the American shipping standard of 18 wheelers. This is impressive to me because many if not most of the heavy vehicles in the Lego City line are decidedly European in design - concentrating heavily on cab-over trucks (which fell out of favor in the US in the 90s), straight trucks (where cab and cargo area share the same body), and shorter trailers when they are used. I have nothing against the European designs (and I certainly don't care to debate about relative merits) and considering that Lego is itself a European company it makes perfect sense that most of their designs would reflect their own surroundings. However, as an American I must admit that I like it when sets show detail and design that are more familiar to me. This set nailed them both.<br></li><li>The store, though small and unimpressive to me at first glance, proved to be a whole lot of fun packed into a tiny package. It's a bit of a juxtaposition when considered in view of the truck as the truck is so good both in scale and detail and the store is obviously far smaller and less detailed than a real Toys R Us would be, but what the designers did with it was VERY enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed the tiny toys built from 1x elements for display on the shop wall. They inspired me to see what I could create with a random handful of loose pieces from my collection and extended my enjoyment of my build session for at least another hour. The addition of many fun accessories and the two extra minifigures (a little boy and a woman - which are altogether too rare in the Lego City series) seals the deal and makes this set an unqualified winner.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>You can only get the set through Toys R Us, of course. This makes perfect sense, but the fact of the matter is that if I had not randomly come into possession of a Toys R Us gift card (which has never happened to me before and likely never will again) I probably wouldn't have even found out about this. Not really a ""con,"" for certain, but I guess I'll have to be a little bit diligent in my research about what promotional sets become available in the future to ensure that I don't miss something this cool.<br></li></ul>
<p>If you enjoy the Lego City theme you need to get this set. It's attractive, impressively well designed and FUN. I'm almost strictly a build-and-display type of Lego fan, but I defy anyone to build this truck and not to push it around the desk a few times in wonder! It's simply infectious. If you're thinking of buying the 3221 set or are torn between it and this set, I suggest you buy this one. The addition of the store, accessories and minifigures more than justify the $15 US price increase in my opinion. I am very satisfied with my purchase and I'm quite sure that if you buy this you will be as well.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Brickmaster48","2013-09-30T16:01:23.943Z","Great set for Lego fans who love Toys R Us","<p>This toys r us set is great. I got this set for my birthday in 2013, I thought this set would have been retired by now just like 3221 city truck which I already had. When I got it I was thrilled to have it. If you were to compare the value to 3221 this set gives you more for your money because you get one more minifig and of course the toys r us store. If you&#39;re deciding whether to get this set or 3221 I would get this one for the simple fact that you get more for the same price, it is an official toys r us product, and who doesn&#39;t love the teddy bear.&nbsp;</p>
