"Ethiel","2010-09-23T07:21:02.757Z","In spite of minor flaws this set will be a or the highlight of your collection!","<p>I already own the UCS X-Wing, Y-Wing and Star Destroyer. I will compare the Lambda-Shuttle with my experience on these models. I think a pros-cons-list will give you the best overview of my thoughts.</p><p><br></p><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Very, very impressive design. It absolutely does justice to the Lambda-Shuttle from the movies. Yeah, the wings are a bit thick, but it is technically not possible to use thinner lego pieces, and maintain the size. From all the Star Wars ships, I consider the Lamda-Shuttle not to be the most iconic one, but to be the one with the most elegant and timeless design. This is, where it shines. From all your Lego-Sets, this is the one your Star Wars-hating girlfriend/wife might accept in the living room.</li><li>It's huge. Really. Before I bought it, I looked at pictures, videoclips and the offical measurements, but I was still suprised how big it is. Never thought my X-Wing can look so small.<br></li><li>It's in minifig-scale, which is great because...</li><li>...five minifigs are included, two of them Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader with chrome lightsabres. Wow.</li><li>Surpisingly solid. Of course there are some points that are not supposed for holding the model (especially the sides of the hulk, where the wings are attached), but the wings are far less problematic than I thought before building it.<br></li><li>The two wings on the side can be lifted up for landing position. A landing gear is included, too.</li><li>The cockpit can be opened and features seats for 4 minifigs</li><li>Pricing is fair. Right now it's sold for about 260 $/€. It's possible to get it cheaper, I managed to get it for 235 € on eBay (MISB). With 2503 Pieces (plus ~15 leftover pieces), this is the usual price per piece for a Star-Wars-UCS-Set</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>The wing tips wobble on the slightest concussion, which disturbs the massiv, solid impression. So place it on a vibration-free spot ;)</li><li>You need 2 cranks to lift up the wings. One for every wing. Why? The X-Wing gears showed that it is possible to move 4 wings with one crank. And the X-Wing crank is perfectly included in the overall design. This set has two cranks, that are ought to be removed after changing the wing position. Thankfully there is a lot of free space in the interior of the chassis, so skilled builders will be able to modify the gears.</li><li>The landing gears can not be attached on the model, while it is put on its stand. If you want to attach the landing gears, prepare for some fumbling, because there is no solid connection between landing gear and set. If you lift the set without holding the landing gear, it will fall off.</li><li>Stickers. First, they're but loosely into the box (I was lucky, that they were not too crinckled). Second, legofans don't like stickers. Of course, the big Sticker, with the technical information on the shuttle is hardly to avoid. But there are&nbsp; FIVE more of them, for screens in the cockpit. They are put on pieces, that could've been easily printed.</li><li>Building the wings is more work than fun.</li><li>Very, very hard to disassemble. As soon as you connect the wings with the gears of the hulk, you will see it, too. You will never get them off again, unless you're using brute force. (check page 60 of the second manual, once the bars are put in, they will stay in...forever!)<br></li></ul><br><h4>Summary</h4>The Set definetely has its flaws, most of them are minor, but espacially the attaching of the landing gear and the single cranks for each wing can be annoying. But in the end, this is a UCS, so it's the overall appearance that counts. And this set delivers in that point. It's not as big as the Star Destroyer or the Millenium Falcon, but let's be honest, if you're not into Star Wars, the Star Destroyer is a huge, ugly, grey block, and the Falcon ist a strange looking ...thing, that is difficult to display, because it's so flat. The Lambda-Shuttle is a most impressive and easy to display model, whose elegance and beauty will evoke dozens, hundreds of ""WOW""s from your friends and visitors, no matter if the like Star Wars and/or Lego, or not.<br><br>Despite the flaws, I'll give this set 5/5 Bricks. The final result is just fantastic and 4/5 wouldn't do it justice.<br><br>If you want a great model to play, you just shouldn't check any UCS at all.<br>If you want an astonishing building experience, you should consider other sets, before spending so much money.<br>If you like the design in general and want a beautiful model to display, go get it! Now!<br><br>",TRUE,5,4,3,1,5
"Zuma","2010-10-08T17:02:30.307Z","Beautiful for collectors to display. ","<p>Star Wars sets are expensive, and UCS sets even more so, but you do pay for what you get... And what you get here is amazing! </p>
<p>Four books of instructions and 1 sheet of stickers. The instruction books came out of the box a bit mangeled and pages creased, but the stickers were fine! I think that it would be&nbsp;best if these were in the box in a paper envelope with a cardboard backing to avoid them becoming creased and damaged. The stickers for the cockpit controls and put on the back of inverted slopes - a good design idea, so I did not mind having them for this. No numbered bags, so best to spend some time and sort the Lego out first, or just open the bags keep the Lego in them to help you find the parts. </p>
<p>I was missing one piece in total, not the first time I have had a new set missing a piece, but with Lego's great customer service, it is easy to obtain it. </p>
<p>The build is good, but you must not rush the parts with the gears as these must not be too tight or out of line, as when you try and attach the wings it will cause problems. The two wings are an identical build - I built one and then built the display stand, and then the other wing to provide a break from them. This repeativeness I did not find boring due to the interesting and realistic way the wings were built using technic pieces and bricks - leading to a visually nice look. </p>
<p>It is great set for displaying with a sleek and attractive design, but displaying it highlights one of its weaknesses: it is too front heavy. Placed on the landing gear, it leans noticably towards the front, and it is noticable.&nbsp;If you open the cockpit - it opens frontwards&nbsp;and rest the front of that on the ground that is enough to stablise it. Or&nbsp;build a counterweight in the rear of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other issue is it unstableness - i.e. it wobbles, and I mean it wobbles! </p>
<p>However, remove the landing gear and place it on the display stand, and both of these issues go away, so for displaying it is best to use the display stand, which is also good as it elevates it up to 2 feet high! </p>
<p>The are seperate cranks for each wings, but I think this helps display it, as you can have one wing vertical and one horizontal - saving some space. With both wings horizontal it takes up the same space as the UCS Millenium Falcon. </p>
<p>If you want a beautiful set for displaying,&nbsp;great building experience and the odd swooshing around with outstanding design that will turn the heads of non-lego liking people, then this is definately the set to get - by far the best looking UCS set I have. If you want something that has a lot more playability, but does&nbsp;not have the visual impact, and for not much more cost, then I would go for the Death Star. Thus a four for playability and five for the others. </p>

"superdave","2010-12-23T11:34:33.503Z","The White Colossus","<p>Since I first saw early images of this set it's been on my list. The gleaming white hull, the sleekness of the design, and the inclusion of movement features (the wings) all caught my eye. Now that I've finished the build, I feel I can comment on 10212 Imperial Shuttle as one of my new favorite sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the build is often repetitive (the ship is almost completely symmetrical and the wings are almost identical), this can be mitigated by building the wings in parallel (build both at the same time, reversing the instructions for the opposing wing). This can be challenging, so if you're intimidated by the thought of flipping everything mentally, just build from the books. The greater issue of the build is the tightness of some of the connections in the wings: connecting long Technic beams and stacks of 1x1 bricks with holes to multiple pins and axles is tough because of the number and tight tolerance of the connections. A little muscle, patience, and determination will win the day, though. One tip to remember early in the build: make sure the gears are lined up the way you want them. It will be difficult to adjust them once the main hull is complete and the wings attached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts selection could be a major strength (if you want lots of one color) or a great flaw (if you want variety in color and element). I consider the parts selection to be a strength in this case, including some new and rare parts (white windscreens, 2x2x3 double slopes, 4x3x1 curved wedge bricks, 2x4 tiles, 1x2 ""double cheese"" slopes, chrome lightsaber hilts, and of course several minifig elements) and lots of more common but highly useful parts (1x4 bricks with studs on side, large gears, 1x1 bricks with hole, 2x4 curved bricks, 1x6x3 full arch bricks). However, due to the color scheme, this is not a set to build under extremely bright light: you may end up snow-blinded by the mass of white pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for playability, this set is one of the best in that category <em>among UCS models</em>. Generally, UCS models are not sturdy enough to survive a trip down the stairs or off the edge of a table like the cars and trucks (and other vehicles) from other themes. However, the Imperial Shuttle features (as many of you surely know) moving wings, opening cockpit, removable landing gear, and moving laser cannons (the ones on the wings can elevate and depress; the other cannons are fixed). Although it's a monster of a set, it would fit in beautifully with a more traditionally playable minifig-scale Star Wars collection. Full points for playability, especially for a UCS set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One note about the ""wobbly wings"": I think they look better in the lowered position and they're definitely less wobbly when gravity is working with you rather than against you. The wobble comes not from flimsy construction (although the upper fin wobbles because of its narrow attachment points within the main hull) but from the tolerances in the gear system that changes their position. The only way to prevent the flop in the gearing system is to keep those gears under consistent load; when the wings are lowered, gravity does this for you. When the wings are raised, any lateral motion plays into the slack in the gears, rocking the wings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the Imperial Shuttle has everything a great set needs. It has a high price, but that price fits what you get: a challenging yet not frustrating build, a mound of good parts, and a beautiful finished product. Buy it if you want it- I don't think it's a critical piece for a Lego Star Wars collector- but if you think you do want it, I'm confident you'll enjoy it.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5

This particular set ranks as one of the best. Though the building experience was excruciatingly repetitive (constructing the wings and top fin was a particularly grueling exercise), the long hours were well worth the sight of beholding the finished model. Lego has finally managed to create a movie accurate depiction of the Imperial Shuttle. Its magnificent white color scheme creates a stark contrast when compared to the other darker colored UCS models.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Both of the wings can raise and lower manually, although this is achieved by use of independent cranks. The cockpit is quite roomy and can house four minifigs in total. My only complaint concerns the fact that the shuttle wobbles immensely when it is on the landing gear and you try to lower the wings. Actually, the landing gear really isn't useful, considering the model looks significantly more majestic when perched on its black display stand. As for the minifigures, Darth Sidious should have been included instead of Luke, as he was never featured in one of these shuttles in the movies. All in all, a very good set that should be added to your UCS collection.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,5

"CapnRex101","2011-01-03T08:15:24.993Z","10212 - UCS Imperial Shuttle","<p>I tend not to purchase many of the UCS sets, but I thought this one was a must. I wasn't wrong. The model is huge, you get plenty for your money and the detailing is fantastic, better than on any other set I have I think.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box for this set very big indeed as you might expect, the image shows the shuttle over Endor firing its primary laser cannons. In the background is the shield generator and huge landing platform from 'Return Of The Jedi'. All of the figures are sat in the cockpit, we can barely see them!</p><p>There are four books of instructions needed to build the set, there were no mistakes in any of them and I had every piece present and correct.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a lot of parts in this set. Including many really interesting ones. I love all of the white arches that make up the sides of the main body of the shuttle and the huge windscreen piece. I also like the large slope pieces which make up the leading edge of the dorsal wing of the shuttle. There are many more pieces which I like, but those are my favourites.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are five Minifigures in this set, Luke Skywalker, who is nice if you don't already have him, Darth Vader, again very nice if you haven't got him, and a Stormtrooper, which is always useful. The&nbsp;stand-out&nbsp;Minifigures for me however are the Imperial Officer, who is a rare Minifigure, having only appeared in one set before now, and the Shuttle Pilot, who is exclusive I think, there have been other shuttle pilots, but this one looks different to the rest, he has a different hat and another torso, which are both nice pieces.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build as you might assume was a long one, it took me about six or seven hours! It was quite difficult, with a lot of Technic elements. Building the body, the cockpit and the dorsal fin was fine, but as other reviewers have mentioned, building the wings however was really quite boring, each one takes about forty five minutes, which is too&nbsp;repetitive&nbsp;for my liking. The repetitive build is what knocks a mark off for me.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When you get the model finished, it looks incredible, the bodywork is wonderful, unbelievably detailed and very smooth. Thanks to the inclusion of a stand the model can be displayed with its wings folded down. It also includes landing gear, which allow it to be displayed really well in landing mode. The wings are moved up and down by two&nbsp;separate&nbsp;cranks at the rear of the vehicle. My favourite part of the model is the cockpit, the detail is fantastic, it has four seats, which is excellent, and there is space for more.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Altogether, this is a great set, the figures are pretty nice, and the ship itself is incredible, the details are brilliant. A lot of work must have gone into designing this set. But, being a UCS model, the playability for this set is very low. This is not a set to buy for young children, I would recommend not purchasing this set for anyone under thirteen. The display possibilities however for this set are endless, and because of that, I give it...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,2,5
"Skodyna","2011-02-24T10:58:51.423Z","Motorize!","<p>Ok, this review will not be as the others, I will talk only about the motorization of the wings, so read this only when you are thinking about adding the motors, otherwise this review will not be useful for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How much?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Yes, money - the deciding factor in almost all purchases of LEGO. We, UCS collectors, are quite used to paying high prices for UCS models, we know that they are special in many ways. But I warn you - precisely revise your budget - you will need more than half a price of the own model for purchasing motors, bateries, extensions etc. Not mentioning you need the shuttle itself, which is not cheap either. Not convinced it is worth it? Read the next paragraph.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Here are reasons that convinced me to motorize this model - first of all, I hated those two holes for levers in the back of the shuttle, they ruined the sleekiness of the model in my eyes + the mechanism&nbsp;is very poor, you have to lift the wings separately, which is almost impossible when you hold the shuttle in your hands. Also I knew, that there is a lot of unused space in the belly of the shuttle. But as I sad, the unchanged great look and functions of the model were priorities for me and I managed to quite succeed in that. In fact, you probably would'n find anythink different on first sight.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I will not tell you how exactely put the motorization together, every builder have it's own way, but here is the list of parts essential for proper function:</p>
<p>2x M-motor 8883 (one is not strong enough to pull both wings up, XL-motor is too big)</p>
<p>3x Extension wire 8886 (the shuttle is quite large, you'll need that to reach the motors and the IR Receiver)</p>
<p>1x Lights 8870 (why not, you have the battery anyway and the landing lights on the floor are easily accessible)</p>
<p>1x IR Reciever 8884 + 1x IR Remote control 8885</p>
<p>1x Rechargeable battery 8878 + 1x Transformer 8887 (the normal battery box loses power too fast)</p>
<p>And don't forget you'll need a few white bricks, you will have to change the structure of the model a bit during the motorization.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finally!</strong></li></ul>
<p>Now get to work and have fun with squeezing all the things into the shuttle. Here are some final advices: </p>
<p>Try to plan things ahead and implement the power functions along with the progress of building, once the shuttle is finished, it's almost impossible to break it down or dissasemble.</p>
<p>Place both motors in the back and attach them to the gearing directly, without adding any more gears than there are. This operation requires pretty heavy interference into the infrastructure of the model, but is necessary in order to maintain the stunning look of the shuttle. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>Control the motors separately, if you try to connect them with an axle, they will get stuck - each of them moves with different speed.</p>
<p>Mind the space where landing gear should be attached, do not block it!</p>
<p>Place the IR Reciever from below the model, it will work fine there and will not be seen easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good luck!</strong></li></ul>
<p>Now you know all you need, don't miss the opportunity to upgrade one of the greatest LEGO Star Wars sets to even greater... well, that sounds weird. Anyway I will upload video of my motorized shuttle on youtube soon, so keep looking for that, it may convince you to do something similar. Also don't be shy to ask me any questions.</p>
<p>Keep on building!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>HUGE when completed. &nbsp;It's also extremely impressive to look at, possibly even moreso than the Millenium Falcon. &nbsp;It's just so... regal, so stately, that it somehow trumps the larger, more complicated, more recognizable Millenium Falcon.</li><li>Plenty of build time and pieces. &nbsp;Took me about 8 hours to finish, but I was also taking a picture after every page to create a time-lapse of myself putting this together.</li><li>Interesting construction for the wings. &nbsp;I'm always a fan of the clever little things LEGO does, especially with Technic pieces.</li><li>Rare minifigs. &nbsp;But, as I'm not a ""collector"", just an enthusiast, I don't really care about the minifgs that much. (sorry to any collectors out there!)</li><li>LEGO seem to listen to the people of BrickSet: the most common complaint I heard about this set (besides repetition in the wings) was that the instruction booklets and/or the sticker sheet came bent or mangled. One person suggested they put these items in a separate bag with a piece of cardboard in it.... which is exactly how it was in mine!</li><li>Did I mention big and stately?</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Sure there are tons of pieces, but the vast majority of them are white and small</li><li>Wings were somewhat repetitive, but I found the same thing about the AT-AT's four legs and the Millenium Falcon's 7 (!) landing gear; if something in LEGO is symmetric, I assume there will be repetition, so this didn't really bother me</li><li>I'll reiterate what other people have said and state that LEGO really needs to do better differentiation between dark grey and black in their instruction booklets!</li><li>Where do I put the landing gear and wing cranks when it's on its stand?</li></ul>
<p>To sum up, this is a huge kit which makes a very impressive model in the end. &nbsp;It was fun to build and I now have even more parts to play with if I ever branch out from just sticking to the kits. &nbsp;If you're a Star Wars fan, this is a MUST HAVE. &nbsp;If you're a spaceship fan, this is a MUST HAVE. &nbsp;Otherwise, this is a MUST HAVE. &nbsp;Love this kit!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"blaksamu12","2011-03-27T22:23:05.48Z","Epic.  Enough Said.","<p>This set is so EPIC!&nbsp; There are five excellent minifigures, 2,503 amazing pieces, and an awesome finished product.&nbsp; This set from my knowledge can only be purchased from Lego Shop @ Home or aLego Store (i got mine from my local Lego Store).&nbsp; Whatever you may have heard about this set, it is totally worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures:</h4>
<p>The minifigures in this set is very cool.&nbsp; You get five minifigures, Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker (episode six version, different colored hands), the exclusive Shutte Pilot, Imperial Officer, and the Stormtrooper.&nbsp; Darth Vader is the same as the recent versions, but has a chrome lightsaber hilt, which is a huge plus.&nbsp; Luke also has a chrome hilt, and has very good detail.&nbsp; The Imperial Officer is similiar to earlier versions but has a little different torso and face.&nbsp; The Shuttle Pilot is exclusive to this set, so that basically makes him super awesome.&nbsp; The Stormtrooper is also a nice edition, since they are kind of rare nowadays with the Clone Wars sets.&nbsp; <strong>Minifigures: 5/5</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Building Experience:</h4>
<p>The building experience has many pros, but a few repetitive steps too.&nbsp; The first thing I did was take about an hour to sort the peices and build the minifigures.&nbsp; Then, right away, you begin to build the many body of the set.&nbsp; This section is much more interesting to build than later parts (wings), but requires patience.&nbsp; For example, if the gears are not n the right position, the wing function will not work.&nbsp; This happened to me, but luckily i discovered the problem early on, before most ofthe body was built.&nbsp; After the body of the ship is completed, the bottom half on the cockpit is built.&nbsp; This part is boring in my opinion, but does use some interesting pieces.&nbsp; Next, you build the top wing.&nbsp; The top wing is more fun to build than the other two since it is not repetitve.&nbsp; Once you connect the wing to the body, you build the landing gear.&nbsp; The landing gear is very interesting and fun to build.&nbsp; After that, the top part of the cockpit is built.&nbsp; This in my opinion is the most intersting part of the build.&nbsp; The variety of pieces creates a very cool, sleek covering to the cockpit.&nbsp; Then you build some back detail, and&nbsp;then buidl the&nbsp;last two wings.&nbsp; The wings are repetitive&nbsp;and boring, but look great when finished.&nbsp; Lastly, you build the&nbsp;stand, which is pretty fancy.&nbsp; There is an epic&nbsp;plaque piece with all the details&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Lambada class shuttle.&nbsp; The building wasn't super hard and&nbsp;took me (13) a total of 9 hours.&nbsp; The only&nbsp;complaint, besides some of the repetitive-ness, is&nbsp;the directions dont give a clear difference between the black and dark gray pieces, which can cause problems.&nbsp; <strong>Building Experience: 5/5.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts:</h4>
<p>A definate&nbsp;pro here.&nbsp; There is tons of&nbsp;rare if not brand&nbsp;new pieces in this set.&nbsp; There is mostly white peices and technic pieces.&nbsp; There are a good amount of black, gray, and dark gray pieces too.&nbsp; A good MOCist would love the wide variety of pieces.&nbsp; The cockpit&nbsp;window would make a good window for a custom ship...<strong>Parts: 5/5</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Playabilty:</h4>
<p>For a normal Lego set, the playabilty is horrible.&nbsp; There is no swooshing ability and the ship is very fragile.&nbsp; However, this is not a normal set.&nbsp; This is a highly detailed UCS with lots of playability, for a UCS set.&nbsp; The laser guns move up and down and the wings can be moved up and down with two spinning gears in the back of the shuttle.&nbsp; The cockpit can be opened and four of the minifigures can be put inside (i put everyone except for the stormtrooper in the cockpit area).&nbsp; So, the <strong>playability for a UCS set is 5/5.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Value for Money:</h4>
<p>A good deal considering its immense size and pieces count, plus the fact it is a UCS set, since UCS sets are often overpriced.&nbsp; For a collector, the price is totally worth it, but for a younger kid, $260 is not worth it, since the build would be really tough and there would be no swooshing ability.&nbsp; <strong>Value for Money: 5/5</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overall:</h4>
<p>My favorite set that I own (and the largest).&nbsp; I really see no cons in this set, thats why everything is a 5/5.&nbsp; The build can be boring and repetitive, but is worth it&nbsp;in the end.&nbsp; A huge amount of rare and new parts in this set make it more awesome.&nbsp; Good playability for a UCS set, with moving parts and wings.&nbsp; The Value for Money is also excellent, with just over 10 cents a pieces.&nbsp; <strong>Overall, this Epic and Awesome set gets a 11/10</strong>.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<div>The box is kind of flimsy. It's just one layer of cardboard, meaning not much support. I would have liked a little more structure, especially for a set that is a limited exclusive and should earn collector value over time if stored properly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The instructions are split into 4 books. Mine were a bit wrinkled and bent from the box but nothing that prevented us from reading them. One flaw in the instructions is that it's nearly impossible to tell the difference between dark gray and black pieces. We made that mistake a few times and had to back up when we realized we were using the wrong color.</div>

<div>The set also includes 5 stickers. My sticker sheet was pretty beat up (again, the loose packing) but luckily the stickers themselves were unharmed.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The set has a lot of neat parts. Most of them are white. I mean, just look at the finished model on the box -- obviously it's mostly white. If it wasn't white, it wouldn't be an imperial shuttle. There's also a decent amount of light gray (the body), black (the stand) and a few other colors sprinkled in here and there. It's a good mix of technic and traditional pieces. We were not missing any pieces, and had multiple extras of very tiny pieces. (I guess Lego knows those are the easiest to lose.)</p>
<p>It took us about an hour to sort the pieces into ~20 groups by color and type. They were pretty well sorted by the bags they came in.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set has great Minifigs. You get Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker with chrome lightsabers. It's brilliant that Luke has two different-colored hands. My wife thought that was a mistake until I explained what happens at the end of Empire Strikes Back. :-)</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>We built the model in 4 sessions of 2-3 hours each. You start with the main chassis (including all the gear work -- get it right before you seal in the gears), then add on the top wing, cockpit, and side wings. The last few steps are mainly details around the edges.</p>
<p>It's not the most challenging build, but you need to bring your A-game. Some parts are very intricate, such as the gear work in the chassis and attaching the wings. The technic connections on the wings can be tight. Kids would get easily frustrated by this.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>It's stunning and huge. I much prefer the visual presentation when the wings are down, and it's sitting on the display stand. You'll get a lot of &quot;Wows&quot; for this one. While it's many fewer pieces, it's more visually impressive than the Millenium Falcon in my opinion. Especially to someone who is not a huge Star Wars fan.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>If you like Star Wars and the challenge / grandeur of such a huge set, then you'll love the Imperial Shuttle. It's a display piece. Do NOT buy this for kids. For one, the build would probably overwhelm them. And secondly, it's much too big and intricate to play with, like whooshing it through the air. It's best kept grounded.</p>

It&#39;s great, this is my favourite ship from the original trilogy, when I was a kid. Overall, it was fun to build, and challenging in some places,&nbsp;the only exception was the wings. It&#39;s actually almost minifig scale, about 3/4th to 7/8ths of true minifig&nbsp;scale from my old Star Wars technical manuals combined with Wookieepedia. The only big complaint was that you can&#39;t put rows of troops in the main cargo area or anything else - it&#39;s just for gears and structural integrity, and that is why it gets a 4.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building Experience: The first part of the build was fun, and setting each gear perfectly aligned to each other and to each of the other three&nbsp;gear trains was challenging, but fun. The body was fun to put together, and though I initially got upset that you couldn&#39;t use the cargo/transport area, I got over it. The wings got a little boring and repetitive due to the standard brick after standard brick and the overload of white technic pieces on white technic pieces. I guess this is why I like transportation and not building houses or modular buildings.</p>

<p>Parts: Some of the&nbsp;parts are almost only unique to this set, which is cool. I like the way LEGO&nbsp;used curved white pieces. The ion thruster bank (dark blue, translucent) is a little small but looks nice; it could have extended a few rows of stud on each side to make it more proportionally accurate to the size in the movie.&nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t know [Chewie], fly casual.&quot;- in reference to my memory of the engines lighting up in the movie and watching it fly through space.</p>

<p>Playability: I love folding the wings up and down, I love that people can sit in the cockpit. I replaced LEGO&#39;s avionic printed pieces with my own though. If this was true minifig scale, there would be 6 seats instead of 4 though.</p>

<p>Value for Money: It&#39;s about the standard price of 2010: 10 cents a piece.</p>

"Chemistry2101","2019-06-02T15:10:47.807Z","The best set ever?","<p>I bought this set second-hand on&nbsp;bricklink&nbsp;from a guy in Germany, and paid around &pound;400 after shipping costs etc. While most pieces were in great condition on arrival, there were as per usual some missing pieces, some&nbsp;discoloured&nbsp;pieces, some chewed up or damaged pieces, and some extra pieces. Well that&#39;s all normal on the second hand market in my experience, but I warn potential second-hand buyers to&nbsp;be&nbsp;careful of&nbsp;discolouration&nbsp;on the white bricks, as it can really affect the look of this set. Anyway, on with the review!</p>

<p>First things first, this set is enormous. It&#39;s only when you see it in front of you that you can really appreciate just how big it is. Simply put, the online images and printed images don&#39;t do this thing justice. Even the video reviews didn&#39;t quite prepare me for its enormity. As an owner of the newer UCS Falcon and the older playable UCS Death Star as well as 4 other UCS as well, I have to say this set has the most presence and draws the eye by far the most out of all of the ones I own. In a way, its more impressive than the Falcon as well, because although it has 1/3 the number of pieces, it uses them to tremendous effect, producing an outcome that is sleek, smooth and truly awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>What can I say, most of them are white. Well if you were&nbsp;expecting&nbsp;anything else then try looking at it again. The parts are by modern standards, pretty basic, but there are a lot of larger pieces, especially the white technic beams in various lengths and the bigger white bricks used in the fins,&nbsp;cockpit, sides and top of the main body. Nowadays though it would be a pretty expensive set if you just wanted the parts, so maybe this category has got less relevant with time; nowadays if you buy this, it&#39;s for the whole completed set.</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>While not 100% symmetrical, due to slight differences either side of the main fin, the build is obviously fairly repetitive due to the symmetry, especially when you get to the wings. It starts off quite slowly, but once you start working on the outer bodywork it picks up quite quickly and becomes pretty fun until the end. The fin and wings were actually very fun, and although repetitive I didn&#39;t really mind just because they were pretty quick and enjoyable anyway. The cockpit and upper part of the main&nbsp;body flew by, and were definitely the best parts.</p>

<p>Finished Model:</p>

<p>The design is awesome, and makes superb use of sloped parts to create effect to create a smooth finish, with just enough studs showing to remind you it&#39;s LEGO. I like the fact that the wings can be raised or lowered, but would advise against changing them on the stand as it is a bit too fragile. Design-wise I understand having built it the lack of a boarding ramp; unlike on the Falcon I don&#39;t think it would work very well on this model without serious adaption, and similarly the fact that the landing gear is a separate piece as opposed to folding out from inside is easy to understand once you realise the stand needs room to extend inside the ship for stability, and its directly underneath where the landing gear would be. I love the technic in the wings, and even if you&#39;re not a fan of technic, it doesn&#39;t feel (or look) technic-heavy while building, but it does offer the stability necessary for wings of this size, and it adds to the design, offering some texture without disturbing the overall clean look. The only thing I will say about the fins is that, due to the use of both system and technic techniques, it&#39;s quite hard to get the system bricks to lie flush with each other, and they will want to separate vertically. However there are no stability issues due to this as the technic does most of the supporting, and the small lines produced can actually add detail and look good if you make sure they don&#39;t get too big.</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>When this set was first released, i imagine these were probably nothing that special, but nowadays their simpler designs are actually quite refreshing, not to mention the fact that the designs for stormtroopers, and imperial officers and pilots have changed, so these designs are no longer available in new sets. For anyone with an older imperial collection this set is good because you can add to your outdated collection without the&nbsp;minifigs&nbsp;having different designs; I actually prefer the older style pilots and officers, and for me this variety of&nbsp;stormtooper&nbsp;was made classic by the first playable UCS Death Star.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>Overall this is an amazing set, and I would say that if you are a fan of LEGO, Star Wars, or even just beautifully crafted objects, you should buy this set. Who am I kidding, everyone reading this is a fan of LEGO, and probably Star Wars. But seriously, I can&#39;t imagine anyone who wouldn&#39;t love this set. If you have the money, and you have somewhere out of the sun to display it in all its glory, I recommend wholeheartedly that you buy it. I paid &pound;400 for a used copy with some slightly&nbsp;discoloured&nbsp;white pieces, 4 missing pieces, and 6 or so chewed up pieces. But hey, I got over 10 random extras. Most people might say &pound;400 is expensive for what you get but the Falcon is &pound;650 and this is, in a way, more impressive, so I&#39;d say if you have the money, it&#39;s worth it. I would suggest buying one MISB however, because although you&#39;re looking at about &pound;600 it saves the hassle of missing or broken pieces, and with this set in particular, the issue of discolouration. If you buy one used, the chances are none of the white pieces will be perfect after 10 years, so if you want it to really stand out and look super clean, this is the one set I would recommend buying new and sealed. But if you just want it as a LEGO fan or a Star Wars fan, and you can find one in good condition used, that&#39;s also a great option so long as you&#39;re not going to lose sleep over slightly yellowed bricks. And when I say &quot;slightly&quot;, I do mean slightly, it&#39;s not really that noticeable. TLG will probably never make a bigger model of this craft, due to the wing stability, and it&#39;s hard to see them making a massive improvement on this model, so I recommend buying this one before prices get too ridiculous as they may in future if it doesn&#39;t get a remake / rerelease.</p>
