"Loganwan","2010-03-01T23:04:58.373Z","Another Fire-vehicle for the arsenal","<p>This is a nice little set.&nbsp; If you are a fan of the City Fire sets like I am, then I think you will like this set.</p>
<p>I like that TLG has made these small 4-wheelers instead of the previous 3-wheelers.&nbsp; We get a lot more pieces that are usable in other ways, as well as being able to customize this vehicle, which I think it could use a little bit of.</p>
<p>The wheels sit quite wide on the body.&nbsp; The kit uses a modified 2x2 plate (wide), part number 6157.&nbsp; It moves the wheels a bit too far outside the body, and gives a funny look.&nbsp; I think it would have been better to use a more standard modified 2x2 plate (4600).&nbsp; Luckily an easy fix.</p>
<p>This is a good little set for $2.99, and it fits in well with my Fire vehicles.&nbsp; It is way outside of reality with no water container for the spray nozzle, but there is nothing that says everything should be logical.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"Crt2","2010-06-12T17:11:25.95Z","Cute!","<p>I Got This at Target About......2-3 Months Before This Review. It's a Nice Little Set, Nothing to Do with it Though, But It is Good for Extra Wheels or Filling up a Space on Your Road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>*Cute!</p>
<p>*Figure has Silver Helmet.</p>
<p>*Good Cheap Source for Wheels.</p>
<p>*Good For Filling Spots in your City's Road or Parking lot.</p>
<p>*CHEAP! 31pcs for $3.00 is a Great Deal!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>*as with <em>all</em> The Fire sets, No Fire.</p>
<p>*Hose Thing in The Back is Good For Playability. But Sticks out When Driving.</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>This is a Really Good Set! I Recommend you Get it If you Can still find it for Cheap!</p>
<p><strong>9/10</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>

"Master_Wu","2019-03-20T01:26:55.193Z","Love it!","<p>This little quad is just a must have for any Lego&nbsp;fans out there! It&#39;s got a posable fire hose and a seat for it on the back as well as the driver seat and steering wheel in the front. As for the minifigure, he&#39;s a&nbsp;cool fire chief minifigure&nbsp;with a metallic silver hat and a nicely detailed vest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I think this set is really fun and valuable for the money and great for play!</p>
