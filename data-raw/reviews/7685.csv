"GameOn99","2010-03-04T21:38:49.857Z","So Very Amazing","<p>Wow, all I can say is that this set is amazing.&nbsp; A three level department store with the works.&nbsp; I got this set as soon as I heard it came out, and now i give this review to you as a gift, and i just want to say this beforehand, Short review: Buy this set.</p>
<h4>Outside ground floor</h4>
<p>The outside is, as always, where this set starts.&nbsp; You sort through the pieces for&nbsp;the&nbsp;tiles and make an extravagant pattern that looks even better than it does in the picture after you finish it.&nbsp;The patern consits of a few flat studded bricks, drain/grill plates, dark grey, light grey, dark blue and white.&nbsp; There is a mailbox that opens towords the building for the mailman to pick up* and a lightpost right next to it.&nbsp; The other part of the corner has an ice cream stand with super duper rare and a box that could be used as a trash can or a box for the ice cream man to keep his stuff.&nbsp; The view frof the outside into the first floor displays is amazing, you can see the manaquins with what looks like a bride and groom pair of suits or just some fancy outfits as well as the escelator and a display of some hats.</p>
<h4>First floor</h4>
<p>This is the clothing and random other unamed things.&nbsp; There is, like i said, a manaquin display and hats but there is also a back door to a small outside covered&nbsp;area with a trash can.&nbsp; There is a counter with an old style cash register with the round part that should have the buttons and the lever but the stand has a flaw that is half maken up for.&nbsp; The flaw is that the design leaves two studs that&nbsp;minifig&nbsp;cannot stand on but&nbsp;they still sick out and block the minifig from getting close to the stand, pus the fact that it is a high counter so it is hard for the costomer and the clerk to reach.&nbsp; The disly that causes this though is what half makes up for it bacause it is diamonds/gems(but you can't really see them).</p>
<h4>Second floor</h4>
<p>The second floor is not as cool as the first floor but hey, it's smaller.&nbsp; it is smaller because of the escelator guard that is unessisarilly large and takes up way more space than it should, that shoud be fixed, but the escelators more than make up for it.&nbsp; The cool plates and glasses that for once do not have a purpose other than display or as pieces finnaly let you use these for your houses or people.&nbsp; Other than these and the window that opens, and the awesome (formal form of ward, as in awe, not street use) display of artistry type work on the ouriside with the flags, ther is only one more thing to discuss, another small flaw.&nbsp; The second floor flaw aside from the large railing(that is the third floor flaw, for reference)&nbsp; is that the walkway where the escelator comes off is only two stds wide so a minifig cannot walk there strait, wich, along with almost every flaw, seems to largly effect the way this set can be made into a stopmotion video set.&nbsp; OH YEAH,&nbsp;I forgot, the escelator, it is so much simpler than it looks and super easy to build and the best part of it, it has SEVEN(7) new 2010 pieces, woohoo.&nbsp; These new pieces are like the so called &quot;cheese wedge&quot; or rather 1x1x2/3 slopes but it is two long so you don't need to put two together in MOCs and have that unatractive split in the middle, this piece will be handy in the future.</p>
<h4>Third floor</h4>
<p>This floor has not two, but three displays that are Bouncy balls that are really zamor spheres, a doll house that looks a bit to me like the white and red creator house and a scooter that fits a minifig perfect.&nbsp; The scooter has a nice thin design that is sleek, simple and fun.&nbsp; The escelator ends here but there is a skylight with, wait, what's that, hanging there, it can't be, no, IT IS, A CHANDELIER.&nbsp; The chandelier can be seen partially from the top corner&nbsp;window of the boxpicture and under the &quot;more images&quot; section up at the top of this page but the wierd thing is that you cannot see it from that angle after you build the set, unfortunate.&nbsp; It has a surprsingly easy to make but hard to think of design that is just wow.&nbsp; The gem at the bottom is just plain awesome.&nbsp;Three more things on this chandelir, it has a stick on it so it stays with the third floor whan you take it apart and to be connected, there is a break in the pattern but it faces the wall, so whatever and lastly, the part that connects it to the wall will let it tilt upward and looks like a laser cannon sort of thing or you can make it 180 to face up and then rotate it to face it down so it moves to right next to the wall.&nbsp; Also, if i am not mistaken, this is the first modular house to not have a stair case to get to the roof, aw.&nbsp; Speaking of which...</p>
<h4>Roof and other stuff</h4>
<p>Finnaly, the roof, real simple details with what i think is new pieces and cylinders with some awnings.&nbsp; Lots of room for almost anything that you can think of from a band on a rooftop to a bunge jumper.&nbsp; there are three main parts to the roof, first, the bilboard.&nbsp; This billboard has everything a bilboard needs, a giant face, a 3D part, a new 2x2 plate with one stud in the middle and a spot for the guy who changes them.&nbsp; The second roof part, the skylight, you may remember&nbsp;me talking about the skylight erlier but it is even more impressive from the top.&nbsp; It is two <i>very</i> large car windshields and a long flat element that needs it's own seperate bag.&nbsp; It is sealed down tight but is not actually held by studs, but actually just held down by a total of five pieces.&nbsp; The part across the top is key because if you take it off, they still stay but they can slide out for whatever reason night you might need them to but it also provides a perfect spot for swodfight over glass or a &quot;pit&quot; so to speak.&nbsp; The last and just about funniest part of the set, the window washer, I know, this is why you read the review, don't hate me for taking so long to get here, don't hate me.&nbsp; Anyway, the window washer himself is a cute little gy with the same face as all the other people in the modular house sets (a <i>clone </i>O_O) and a little broom, he looks like the guy who would replace the billboard, handy, a two-in-one minifig.&nbsp; the window washer platform is small but handy and has a clear cup for him so he does not get thirsty and the plank that prevents him from falling off(for the most part) does not block him from standing on half the studs, yay.&nbsp; The one thing that bothers me about the platform though is that it cannot reach the second floor windows,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well that concludes my review exept for the always important love em' or hate em' pros and cons.</p>
<h4><b>Cons</b> and Pros</h4>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Not ideal for videos but can fixed somewhat</li>

    <li>escalator does not move, good bye dream for this set =''(</li>
    <li>window washing platform does not go to second floor.</li>

"SgtSmash","2010-03-06T01:35:43.03Z","Another great set in the Modular Building collection! ","<p>Just picked up the Grand Emporium today at the Mall Of America Lego Store, and spent the past 6 hours putting it together.&nbsp;Needless to say,&nbsp;I am very pleased with this set. Once again, Lego outdid themselves with another fantastic addition to the Modular buildings!</p>
<p>Lego seems to really be listening to the fans, and are trying to right all the wrongs from&nbsp;Cafe Corner. Everyone knows&nbsp;Cafe Corner had&nbsp;plenty of windows without glass, the Grand Emporium also has&nbsp;many windows, but each has&nbsp;glass. The interiors are fantastic, with plenty of detail...even the male minfig in the changing room has&nbsp;yellow legs, meant to&nbsp;symbolize having no pants on LOL...little touches&nbsp;such as this make these sets pure joy to build.</p>
<p>You can look at the pictures to see all the items that the store has to offer, but IMHO it would have been nice if&nbsp;Lego had&nbsp;included&nbsp;some extra items to purchase on the 2nd&nbsp;(dishware) and 3rd&nbsp;(toys) levels, with&nbsp;at&nbsp;least one extra&nbsp;store employee&nbsp;and cash register&nbsp;(you get only one),&nbsp;as well as a&nbsp;person to run the ice cream stand out front (help yourself?).&nbsp;But, these are just ideas, and things you could easily mod&nbsp;yourself. You won't be unhappy with the set as-is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &quot;SHOP&quot; signage out front is a snap to build, unlike&nbsp;the chaotic &quot;1932&quot; signage from the Fire Brigade set. One touch I really enjoy is the billboard on top. That just makes the set right there. Very few slip-ups, I completed the build in about 5-6 hours.</p>
<p>All in all, $149 US is still a lot for a Lego set, but these Modular buildings are well worth the price, with over 5 minifigs (not including storefront mannequins), 3 levels to enjoy, and much much more.</p>
<p>Now....on to the Lego Carousel! Wish me luck..... : )</p>

"Andrew85","2010-06-07T17:42:36.45Z","Good but better available!","After reading all the reviews before mine I could not find one that summed up how I felt about this set. <br><br>Good points: The biggest plus for me is the number and variation of minifigs, nice torso printing, hair pieces and 2 Lego ladies. The revolving door I thought would stick but its well designed and spins very rapidly, escalators look great between the floors. The ground floor windows are nice and big and let you see in pretty well, especially seeing those mannequins which look great! The curves of the building really make it stand out against of modular models, the pattern on the floor outside the entrance and window canopies brings welcome colour and finally I love the ice cream cart and classic postbox!<br><br>Bad points: The price, ahhhhhhhh! In comparions with other Modular buildings which have a similar piece count the prices is a 30-40% increase, yes there are a few more minifigs which I understand are expensive to make but not enough to justify that much! The build, sadly this was not the most enjoyable Modular building to make, the 1st and 2nd floor are pretty much the same except for the interior, it was repetitive and unexciting, I did them first to get them out of the way. The interiors on these 2 floors are also a bit dull because they are bare, 2-3 tables in each have nice things on top but the walls could do with some more shelves and items on them like the ground floor. I believe there could have been a little more variation between the top two floors in terms of colour and bricks, the repetetive arch in stone makes it different to re-build this set in a totally different way unlike cafe corner.<br><br>To sum up, it looks as if there are more negatives than postitives but upon doing the review I found more good things to say about this set than expected. There are alot of nice small touches about this set I love but nothing that makes me think wow this set is special! Most of the bad points have come about because of comparisons to the other modular sets, I own Cafe Corner, the green grocer and the fire station and now this one. The Green grocer in my opinion is a better set, with a massive price difference, but much more fun and interesting build with the bay window, nice more rare colours. It only pips the fire station slightly, if you dont' own any modular buildings purchase one of the others available before their gone!<br><br>If you have the others like me you will probably want this to add to your collection as it will fit in very nicely with the others if you can bare the cost!<br><br>I give it 82/100<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
"Wrangler08","2010-03-12T01:55:59.357Z","Great Addition to any town but....","Pros: (all throughout)
- Well designed
- Its Another Corner set that makes your city block look complete
- Lots of Rare pieces
- Giant Skylight +Chandelier (side note it actually lets alot of light flood into the building during the day)
- 5-7 Mimi figs depending on how you count it.
- Working Revolving Door
- Large opening in floor makes it perfect for dramatic views
- Toys actually make sense

Thats pretty much it for the positives about this set.

Cons: (from bottom to top)
- Baseplate bends on cemented corner
- No Ice cream vendor
- Cashier can't stand near cash register
- No buttons on register
- Dressing room ""curtains"" very stiff, barely moveable
- Escalator is just for show, hard to place figures on
- Second floor is bland. It only has two tables.
- Third Floor repeats second floors build - escalator
- No roof Access
- Window washer can't pull himself up or go to the second floor.

So after all those complaints I'd still highly recomend this set. Why?
Its a perfect fit into any Lego city, & it'll be worth a ton of cash to collectors
If you arn't a collector or building a lego city of your own, skip this set save your money for what you like.",FALSE,5,5,3,5,4

"Alexdiazb","2010-03-26T07:31:13.73Z","An exceptional addition to Lego City! Simply Amazing!","<p><strong>About ""Les Grands Magasins"" or Grand Emporium!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got this wonderful set almost 3 weeks ago, when it was available at Lego Shop.com in Germany. This set, starting with the box is simply amazing. The design of the box make it very attractive for the customers as it makes people turn the head and see it.<br/><br/>Instructions come in 3 separate booklets, being the first for the ""Clothes/Parfums Dept"", the second for the ""Houseware accesories"" and the third for the ""Toys Dept"" and the roof.<br/><br/>Every ""floor"" comes in separate bags, easy to identify by the numbers on them: 1, 2 and 3. the bigger parts such as the ""cristal"" part of the roof and some parts of the stair come in a separate bag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent more or less 2 and half hours to build the first part, and almost 4 hours for the&nbsp;rest.&nbsp;I must say I took my time to relax and enjoy building it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets speak then about every floor:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1st Floor ""Street Level"" </strong></p>
<p>The ""Street Level"" covers the first part of the building, it comes on the street side with an Ice Cream place where you can enjoy some ice cream while your Mom, Sisters, etc go shopping inside. (Never saw before this, so I was very happy to find it). Also there is a nice mailbox where you can put all your letters to be sent to our Lego inhabitants. The flowers on the entrance give the magasin a nice flair, you could almost feel you are there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once inside the building you will find yourself with a nice enviroment: 2 nice figures which look like modelling the clothes (You can also use them as people for your city as the face is turned back), a nice collection of hats, a nice entry door :D, a stand for parfums and eaux de toilette, a nice helper on the pay desk and a nice place where your Lego people can try their new clothes! (Pay attention to the person changing his trousers :D). </p>
<p><br/>I find it very nice, but personally, maybe it was possible to add more stuff. However is ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to go to the upper levels, you must take the stairs (was absolutely surprised as i never imagined you could represent it in a so detailed way!) An elevator could be a must, but maybe the lack of space made it impossible to include. The only problem is the figures can barely stand up on the stairs. <br/><br/>On the main entrance (street side) you will find the ""SHOP"" word (kinda complicated to set it properly right) but not a big matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2nd Floor ""Houseware accessories""</strong></p>
<p>If you want to buy some dishes, plates, and glasses, this is the right floor. Take the stairs to your left on the ""Street Level"" and go up. Watch your hands when you are climbing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once there, you will find yourself with some plates in gold, some glasses and some green Wine glasses. (Loved the color). Maybe it was more room for more stuff, but is not a big deal. I think more windows could be necessary as the entire building is a little bit dark after you put all the floors. Outside this floor, there are some flags which give the ""Magasin"" even more flair! Makes me remember the ""Galeries Lafayette"" in Paris or the ""Galeria Kauhoff"" in Germany. Then if you want to buy some things for your kids, you must go to the:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3rd Floor ""Toys""<br/></strong>Once here, you will find yourself on the last floor of the building. Once again, take the stairs and watch your hands. Your kid will be delighted with the scooter, the Doll house and the balls (Too big for the rack where they have to be in). Special mention to the amazing cristal lamp on the ceiling! Maybe is Swarosky? Baccarat? anyway is really cool and visually attractive!<br/><br/><strong>Roof</strong></p>
<p>The roof, and the last part&nbsp;of the building, come with a transparent glass which provides light to the building during day. It also comes with the Spot of the magasin showing a lego face with a wrapped gift! Very original! Special mention to the guy who cleans the windows, the only bad thing is you can only use it attached to the last floor. Maybe was interesting to make him climb and descend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>
<p>The figures are pretty cool! Loved the desk helper (she can work in a part-time job as flight attendant on my lego planes). The models on the stands are simply cool! and also was very funny to notice the bags of the lady. Never thought to build/create that lol!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>There were nothing i didn't like about this set. Love how high it is and the general view on the lego City! finally you can go shopping! The next addition could be a Supermarket! :D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It worth the price as it comes with new pieces, new figures and lot of original things. If you can afford it, buy it as you won't be dissappointed!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

"Nased","2011-05-12T08:11:45.633Z","Pictures don't justify the beauty of this Awesome Building!","I was a little hesitant to purchase this set when it first came out because I don't find the image on the box as attractive as the previous sets. I was wrong and the building is so much more beautiful than it seems on the box. Hopefully my review will give a sufficient summary of each layer of this building.<br><br>First floor:<br>1) The design of the tiles along the corridor is very nice. It is as beautiful as the previous two sets. There is a lamp post, two big pots of flowers, post box, brown rubbish box and an ice cream stall.<br>2) The exterior wall of level 1 is well crafted. The transparent glass windows showcase the clothes and hats that are on sale inside the grand emporium. The yellow words ""SHOP"" enhance the overall exterior design of level 1.<br>3) Inside the grand emporium, there are several nice features such as the cashier counter, dressing room and most importantly the beautiful escalator.<br>4) There is a backdoor and it makes the building very realistic. 6/7 mini figures are placed on this level though 2 mini figures are used as mannequins.<br><br>Second floor:<br>1) This level is slightly empty in my opinion. There are only golden plates, transparent and green glasses on display at this level. <br>2) The building can get repetitive at this level.<br>3) However, this layer looks excellent upon completion. The interior and exterior is simply magnificent and the color of the bricks is rare to me. Really love how it looks when the second layer is placed on the first level.<br>4) Lastly, there is one more escalator leading from second level to third level. It's simply great to get awesome escalator in 1 set.<br><br>Third floor:<br>1) Several toys such as a skate scooter, balls and toy house are available on this level. Seriously I thought more would make this set better.<br>2) The chandelier is awesome. Simple pieces, ingenious design and unique idea created a beautiful chandelier hanging at level 3. It totally ""brightens"" up the entire level 3. <br><br>Roof Layer:<br>1) Nothing spectacular. The sign board is quite nice though. There is a glass ceiling that allows light to penetrate the building.<br>2) The best part about this roof top is that the finishing is very neat. It covers the Grand Emporium nicely and gives a very good finishing.<br>3) The last mini figure of this set is a cleaner and he is cleaning the exterior of the building. Nice idea.<br><br>Mini Figures:<br>1) The heads of the mannequins are printed. So they are two extra figures if you turn the head and show the eyes and mouth of the head. I do consider that I have seven mini figures patronizing the Grand Emporium<br><br>Areas of Improvement:<br>1) I wished there were more staff. A sales girl can't possibly cope on her own. <br>2) I still cannot accept the idea that the Grand Emporium is as big as Green Grocer. I secretly wished that the Grand Emporium could have been the size of two modular houses though.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>I still like this set a lot. I decided to spend 1 hour to write a review for this set as I think that it deserves a score of 4.7 - 4.8 out of 5. Hopefully everyone agrees that the pros of this set greatly outweighs the cons and improve on the current score. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"indykid","2010-11-22T23:42:36.997Z","MY NEW FAVORITE","<p>I got this set for my birthday back in August. I built it in about four hours. I thought it was a bit pricey but which of the modular sets isn't? And luckily I&nbsp;wasn't the one who bought&nbsp;it! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sidewalk was very nice. It was much easier to build than the Cafe Corner sidewalk. I like the sewer grates at the base of the building windows. I've never owned the piece that the flowers sit in so it was interesting to see how that worked. I like the letterbox with two letters and lamp post. the ice cream stand is great with the extra cream inside the ice box and there's a strange crate at the end of the sidewalk which I am not sure what it is for but I'm assuming its a rubbish bin. I use as a newspaper stand. There's a nice shop sign as well and an amazing revolving door. I thought it would be poorly built and have issues with sticking but it has a completely different design than I anticipated and works great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interior of the first floor is fun to build. The booklet even gives you a birds eye view of how it is supposed to look at one point to make it easier for the builder. There is a window display of hats: top hat and blue train conductor style hat. On the other window displays are a male mannequin in a black suit and a female mannequin with a white and blue dress. On the wall are two pairs of short pants: purple and blue. Theres a perfume and make-up table in the middle of the room. It has two green cases, a blue bottle and a gold bottle.&nbsp;Under this table was a round 2x2 platform but I removed&nbsp;it because it caused the table to fall over a lot.&nbsp;In the corner next to the alley way door is a changing room with a small 1x2 table and two capes for curtains. The cash register is on a clear glass counter with four jewels in the display (2 red and 2 blue). Out side behind the building is another strange crate and a street lamp hanging on the wall. Back inside there is a cleverly built escalator. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the second story, the housewares department lies. Theres an openable window&nbsp;at the top of the&nbsp;escalator.&nbsp;There are two tables. One has two gold plates and the other has four goblets. Two clear glasses and two green wine glasses. Outside, there are four flag posts each with a red and blue flag. Inside, there is a large opening on the floor that looks over the first floor. Another escalator leads to the top story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is another openable window and then a small walkway to the rest of the room. Here are the toys. A blue scooter, a blue bouncy ball, a yellow bouncy ball, and a dollhouse. Above the atrium is a chandelier that was great fun to build. Outside is a construction worker cleaning the windows. He has a mug of drink to refresh him and a broom/mop to wipe the windows. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the rooftop is a poorly stabalized billboard and a cleverly made skylight. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>7 minifigs</p>
<p>post box with letters. </p>
<p>Ice cream stand</p>
<p>store with many items inside</p>
<p>easily connects to my cafe corner</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>platform&nbsp;sticks up on the corner.</p>
<p>lack of rooftop access</p>
<p>poorly built stand for&nbsp; billboard.</p>

<p><b>story&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>when my little brother&nbsp;turned&nbsp;ten&nbsp;, he was given this set but&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;want it. straight away he gave it to me and said that if&nbsp;I&nbsp;would build it for him&nbsp;I&nbsp;could keep it.&nbsp;I&nbsp;did build it for him and&nbsp;I&nbsp;did keep it, and now have&nbsp;endless&nbsp;fun with it.</p>
<p><b>everything!</b></p>
<p>this may be a little&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;for your liking for example its twin set green grocer (10185-1) is smaller but has more bricks but is cheaper buy about &pound;50 (depending on where you buy it, prices are green grocer from&nbsp;official&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;store &pound;99.99 and&nbsp;grand&nbsp;emporium &pound;149.99). but for me it&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;matter that much. it comes with 2182&nbsp;pieces, fiddly and large, and 7 enjoyable&nbsp;minifigures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>it comes with three floors, a ground floor that comes with a&nbsp;ice-cream&nbsp;stall, large pavement, a postbox, a lamp, a rotating door and a bin. inside there is an escalator, a changing room, a outside quad area (rather small), a rotating door, a glass cashier and wedding suits (on 2 of the minifigures) and hats and small trouser&nbsp;shelf's&nbsp;with trousers on them. the first floor also has a few&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;of&nbsp;jewellery&nbsp;arranged on a table This floor is the most difficult to build and i would not&nbsp;suggest&nbsp;to buy it for in experienced builders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the&nbsp;second&nbsp;floor consists of another escalator going up to the third floor, a hole for the escalator of the first floor to come through from and a big green glass window which is rather fun and impressive to build. this is the floor with housing needs such as 2 golden plates and 4 glass's. this is a a kind of delicate floor as it is the first one with the hollow base so do not push down to hard when&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;do not fit for it will result in spoiling your hard work by snapping&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;or the work collapsing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the third floor has a hole for the other escalator to come through so that the minifigures can easily be switched from floor to floor realistically. this is also the toy floor where you will find the scooter the boy is holding on the box, and 2 balls and a toy house&nbsp;similar&nbsp;to a creator one. there is a delicate&nbsp;chandelier&nbsp;which stretches over quite a bit which makes it a whole lot harder to have playing access on my personal favourite floor.</p>
<p>the roof has only 2 ways to get to it if you where a minifigure. either being the window cleaner with his wooden lift working all day and night in his work top, or if you live in green grocer you could climb across from your balcony top. but there is a problem with the roof. yes, the signs looks cool, yes the windows&nbsp;don't&nbsp;wobble, and yes, the roof stays in place but the sign&nbsp;doesn't. it need to be&nbsp;allot&nbsp;more stable. this is the only down side to the whole set, how unstable some&nbsp;things&nbsp;are. apart from having to remake the base for the sign,&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;have to edit anything unlike i did with green grocer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>conclusion</b></p>
<p>to be honest with you, after a little while you get used to the lack of stableness in the model and you just have&nbsp;fun, be warned though, the model&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;all that fun if you have nothing for it to go with. there is plenty more space for other things you might want to add in, like another cashier, or another display desk, or something else. that is why i rated this set 5 bricks, because even if it&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;exactly perfect, its still a pack full of bricks and fun.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

        <p>The next installment of the intricately detailed LEGO Modular 
Buildings has arrived with set 10211 Grand Emporium. The set follows on 
from other models in this series including Market Street, Cafe Corner, 
Green Grocer and Fire Brigade which all join together to create an 
amazing city street diorama.</p>
<p><br></p><p>The detail in these models is amazing and sets them apart from 
regular models, as does the average recommended building age. At 16+ 
these models are more in the league of adult collectors who enjoy the 
attention to detail and design and the intricate build.</p>
<p><br></p><p>This set is a model of a three story department store and its 
sidewalk entrance area. There are escalators, mannequins in the window, 
revolving doors, clothing department complete with a cash register and 
fitting room, a glassware department on the second floor and a toy 
department on the top floor.&nbsp; Outside window shoppers can send letters 
and buy an ice cream and gaze up at the window washer suspended from the
 top floor. A chandelier graces the ceiling inside while a billboard and
 skylight sit atop the roof.</p>
<p><br></p><p>The set has an amazing 2182 pieces which will give you an idea of how
 many small embellishments are in the model. Out of all the modular 
buildings Lego has made so far, this set has the most attention paid to 
the inside. It is almost as if Lego initially envisaged this series as 
being display-only models but then decided half way through to focus on 
the inside as well, to make them more interactive.&nbsp; There are many small
 pieces which add a sense of character to the set and give it a sense of
 being part of a real ""lived-in"" Lego city.</p>
<p><br></p><p>The model comes with 7 mini figures which isn't a lot for a set this 
size, but as mentioned earlier the main focus of theses sets is the 
buildings. The Grand Emporium building measures 15"" (38 cm) high and 10""
 (25 cm) wide and slots nicely alongside any of the other modular sets 
making an impressive interactive diorama.</p>        </div>

"av8r1973","2010-12-31T04:23:56.54Z","Awesome addition to the modular building collection - keep it up!!","<p>My wife and I just completed our build of the Grand Emporium.&nbsp; We got a late start to the modular sets and started with the Fire Brigade.&nbsp; This is our second.&nbsp; Compared to the Fire Brigade, there are some things we like better, and some we don't.&nbsp; Fortunately, the list of dislikes is pretty small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, there are some really unique build techniques.&nbsp; Specifically, the roof cornices, 2nd and 3rd story window treatments, escalators and the chandelier.&nbsp; Those are what made the build the most fun.</p>
<p><br/>Secondly, there are some great color combinations in this set that really go well with the period in which this building is set.&nbsp; Good job in coordinating them, LEGO!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, there are some really unique components and even more unique uses of existing components.&nbsp; Well done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>1. Lots of pieces - we love big sets!</p>
<p>2. Great colors and piece selection!</p>
<p>3. Great addition to the 1930's downtown themed street</p>
<p>4. Nice touches (ice cream vendor, mail box, changing room, mannequins, ""toys"", etc...)</p>
<p>5. First brick-built escalators I have seen - very cool!</p>
<p>6. Playability - floors are easily removed and the poses are up to your imagination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons (not too bad, considering)</p>
<p>1. Price (I bought it in Taiwan for&nbsp;right at US$200 (Taiwan gouges&nbsp;LEGO consumers)</p>
<p>2. 2nd and 3rd floor are nearly identical (same build, same components,&nbsp;repetative)</p>
<p>3. Base plate curls up slightly on corner under sidewalk - not cool!&nbsp; Unsure how to fix this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Buy the kit.&nbsp; You won't be disappointed.&nbsp; Despite the couple of cons, the uniqueness of it makes the pros worth getting.&nbsp; If only I could find the Green Grocer for less then US$400 here....</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,3
"Zapp_Brannigan","2013-05-10T14:05:53.777Z","My First Modular Building","Ever since modular buildings started releasing 5 years ago, I have always watched in amazement at the level of detail put into each one, which has never been done before (2008) in the history of Lego. As much as I wanted to have a modular building or two in my city, they were mighty expensive and were quite large in size (my city takes up approximately 1 m x 1.2 m, compare that to 32x32 baseplates which take up 0.25 m x 0.25 m). However, I was fortunate enough to receive 10211 Grand Emporium as a birthday gift, and was very happy that I did.<div><br></div><div>Being the largest set I own to date, the build was not at all that challenging. It took me 7 hours, and some parts were extremely repetitive which made it painstaking (but not difficult) to build...</div><div><br></div><div>...But the final result is stunning. The combination of grey, tan, and touches of dark green goes well together with the 1930's art deco style of architecture, which is evident through the abundant use of arches that adorn every window and along the edges of the roof. The pillars on the ground floor adjacent to the windows are very detailed and require a whopping total of 68 headlight pieces. The green domes are also very appealing and, together with the pillars, prevent the windows from feeling ""jutted out"". Being a corner building, the emporium is designed to be placed at the intersection of 2 roads, which is realistic if you wish to attract more people. The sidewalk is also very detailed, being made of many small tiles, and is decorated in front of the entrance. Finally, the yellow words ""SHOP"" hang over the entrance and span the corner of the building using a flexible rod. Needless to say, the building techniques used were extremely creative and there is no way that I would have ever thought of anything like it.</div><div><br></div><div>The back of the building is completely blank except for a couple of small windows, but this is required if you have other modulars to connect to.</div><div><br></div><div>This set comes with a total of 7 minifigures, all of which have the classic smiley face. Two of these minifigures are used for the mannequins and thus have their faces inverted behind their hair pieces. The human minifigures include a female store clerk, a man (with and without pants XD), his wife and son, and a window cleaner.</div><div><br></div><div>On to the details of the floors.</div><div><br></div><div>The ground floor consists of the landscape immediate to the emporium and the main floor to the emporium itself. Outside, to the left, there is an ice cream stand and a brown garbage bin. To the right is a fancy lamppost and mailbox. Two large flower pots surround the main entrance. The entrance has revolving doors which lead to the interior. The first floor is the clothing department. Here, there is a table with perfumes and cosmetics, a table with hats for men, children's pants on side shelves, mannequins displayed at one of the windows, and a checkout area with an old-fashioned cash register on top of a glass case displaying some&nbsp;jewelry. There is even a small corner for a changing room (made up of 2 minifigure capes for the curtains and flexible rod for the railing). At the back of the building is a rear exit. Escalators (first ever!) lead up to the second floor.</div><div><br></div><div>The second floor is the&nbsp;house ware&nbsp;department. Here, there are some very expensive looking wine glasses and eating plates. There are 2 green/2 white wine glasses and two golden plates. Once again, an escalator leads up to the third floor.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The third floor is the toy department. There are two tables that display a scooter and a doll house, plus a shelf with a yellow and blue ball. An excellently-designed chandelier (also a first!) hangs over the open space where the escalators are. Outside is the cleaning platform where the cleaner can work, the platform hangs from the roof using fixed pieces of rope (how will he clean the 2nd floor windows?).</div><div><br></div><div>The roof was surprisingly more detailed than I first thought, consisting of well over 100 pieces. Up here is a skylight made of very large window pieces, plus a neat advertisement board with realistic details such as the flood lights.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Because it is a modular building, the floors can be easily lifted to allow access to interior. I was actually surprised to discover that neither of the modules were connected by studs whatsoever, but it makes sense otherwise it would be quite difficult to remove the sections (and maybe even fall apart in places where it should not).</div><div><br></div><div>Looking back, I guess it was necessary for the build to be repetitive because the architecture of this building simply demanded it. Repetition actually creates the undulating and harmonious aesthetic that was so characteristic of this building style. Without it in this case, the building would feel out of place and cluttered, which was clearly not the intent. I know that some people may find the Fire Brigade (10197) or Green Grocer (10185) more interesting to build, but it is a result of a different architectural style.</div><div><br></div><div>In terms of furniture, the set provided the essentials. However, there is always room to add more things here and there (Suggestions to add more toys from 10199 Winter Village Toy Shop, add a few Lego sets from 3221 Lego City Truck, etc.)</div><div><br></div><div>At $200 CAD, this set comes out to 9.2 cents per piece, which is very good, so I strongly recommend it if you don't have it already.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, I enjoyed this set to the max. Being my first modular building, I am truly taken aback by all the detail Lego put here. Also, it is the first department store set released in the history of Lego, so it is without a doubt an integral part of any Lego city and absolutely necessary to keep Lego citizens happy.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Nesquik","2013-12-22T08:53:20.623Z","A Grand(ish) Store","<div style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 15px;""><p style=""font-size: 13px;"">The Modular Building line has matured to great effect over the past seven years, with new products becoming a staple event. It's interesting to note that, had the designers not broadened the appeal of these models, the product line wouldn't have progressed to the heights of 'Parisian Restaurant'.</p><p style=""font-size: 13px;"">But looking back, it's becoming clearer that past Modular Buildings were not so focussed, and perhaps lacked the values that Creator sets have become known for.&nbsp;</p><p style=""font-size: 13px;"">This is certainly the case with Grand Emporium - a model that, in some aspects, is beginning to show its age. The Grand Emporium was released&nbsp;<i>only&nbsp;</i>four years ago, and yet in that short space of time, the buildings have gained charming narratives and truer scale.</p><p style=""font-size: 13px;"">In almost identical fashion to the earlier Café Corner, this was the last building to be targeted squarely at AFOLs - the idea being that expansion was possible through multiple purchases, as this would extend upon the Emporium's 'stackable' design. Therefore, the builder could almost seamlessly make their shop taller or longer, which was more a nod at customisation than the actual final design.</p><p style=""font-size: 13px;"">This brings to light what I feel the main problem with this model is, and that is the interior. The Grand Emporium's architecture is undoubtedly beautiful, but there is nothing inside the store to match this appeal, because department stores in real life are much larger affairs. Inside this Lego model, the First and Second floor are quite literally identical in structure, requiring just a change of items of sale (Home-ware on the First floor, toys on the Second floor). It simply looks bare and unattractive, not doing any sort of justice to a large department store.&nbsp;</p><p style=""font-size: 13px;"">There are highlights, however. The chandelier, perfume cabinet and cash register definitely evoke a sense of time and place. For what it's worth however, you would be better off filling each floor with your own little design ideas, and this would at least give the Emporium a sense of originality.</p><p style=""font-size: 13px;"">Despite my criticisms of the interior, this is still a product that I would highly recommend purchasing, if only for the wonderful exterior. There are so many small features to be found that you won't notice the majority until you're actually building the model; the detail on the mosaic entrance, the spinning door, the ice cream cart and the plant pots. This is by far and away one of the most expandable Modular Buildings to date.</p><p style=""font-size: 13px;"">The Grand Emporium is certainly one of the most difficult products I've had to reflect upon (as I built the model when it was originally released). In comparison to the Fire Brigade, Pet Shop, Town Hall and especially the upcoming Parisian Restaurant, the Grand Emporium sits on my table as a&nbsp;<i>model</i>, waiting to be placed in a scene. This just can't be said for any of the later modular buildings, which in my personal opinion, work brilliantly as individual products. Something as complex as a department store simply cannot be replicated at this scale, and judging by TLG's latest efforts in this line of products, they've learnt to choose architecture that is more manageable (or perhaps sensible) in minifigure scale.&nbsp;</p></div>",FALSE,4,5,4,4,4
"Hylocera","2011-12-12T13:39:12.123Z","Insane Detail!","<p>As the title says, this set is the most detailed set I have so far...and the third above $50. Well anyway, onto the review. (P.S. - I am almost a TFOL...just a note :D)</p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p><p>The build was decent. The sidewalk area was really fun, especially the fancy tiling in front of the main door. The first floor was good; though the spinning door was the most complex element, so the build was relatively simple. Of course, with awesome sets comes hard work, so I won't complain about the tedious work spent on the pillar detail on the first floor exterior. All three floors were pretty much the same, with the exception of some small details here and there. The chandelier was a fun build, and so was the rooftop sign.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Parts</strong></p><p>Speechless. Half the pieces included I didn't have, and half of the pieces I didn't have I had in a different color scheme. The light tan was a great color. The dark green windows were epic, and the set also came with a healthy amount of 1x3 tiles. Of which I had none before. The merchandise was cool; the toy section was especially creative. Duh. I've never seen those green shade-y things that go outside the first floor windows before, so thats another nice touch. 2 gold cups, 2 ice cream things, 2 trans-green goblets, 2 1x2 mail tiles...perfect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Playability</strong></p><p>One of the most playable sets I have. The floors can be easily removed to play inside, the spinning door works great, and...lol. Shopping bags. :D The changing room kinda works, the capes don't work particularly well but they still work. Really easy to mod, too. Lots of room inside to put in your own stands for merchandise. Lego Corp. doesn't have to do everything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p><p>2000 pieces for $150? Yes! And I got this during Black Friday so it came with free shipping and a Christmas set. Strange that the Christmas vig didn't ship...I am now convinced that the overpriced sets in other themes (SW, Alien Conquest, etc.) come from overprinting minifigures. I used to think it was inflation, but once I took a look at these figs, it had to be the printing. Super simple minifigures, nothing like the fancy rubber SW heads. Oh, and considering that a lot of elements are hard to get elsewhere for a good price, this set definitely hits Value for Money. I just realized part of this should've been in Parts...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Comparison with LEGO.com description</strong></p><p>So now I'll compare some of Lego's claims with the actual set.</p><p><em>Spectacularly Detailed</em>- That's definitely an understatement. Words can't describe this set's detail.</p><p><em>Designed in a Realistic Scale</em>- Ish. Here's a problem I found when thinking about this topic. If it was realistically scaled, which involved enlarging the building, that would probably result in a higher price and definitely result in less of the awesome tiling on the sidewalk. So either a lower price still in a decent scale, or a higher price thats just a bit bigger. Just a side note, this thing to scale is probably the size of my house. So much for the ""grand"" part...</p><p><em>Special Building Techniques</em>- Yes! Really clever window techniques, changing room, and spinning door. And including the mosaics...</p><p><em>Rare Pieces</em>- Heck yeah. Like I said earlier, the merchandise was epic, and I doubt you could find many of the parts on this set elsewhere. And it even has those clear 1x1 bricks with the studs on the sides!</p><p><em>Authentic Details- </em>Definitely. The cash register is really pro, and the architecture is pretty ridiculous.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah, in conclusion, this is a great set. Totally worth the money, even if it was priced $20 or $30 higher. Thanks for reading!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"LegoCity578","2011-10-30T22:53:42.627Z","Beautiful Piece","<span class=""BVRRReviewText"">Wow, all I can say is that this set is 
amazing. A three level department store with the works. I got this set 
as soon as I heard it came out, and now i give this review to you as a 
gift, and i just want to say this beforehand, Short review: Buy this 
set.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Outside ground floor</span><br>The outside is, as always, where this 
set starts. You sort through the pieces for the tiles and make an 
extravagant pattern that looks even better than it does in the picture 
after you finish it. The pattern consists of a few flat studded bricks, 
drain/grill plates, dark gray, light gray, dark blue and white. There is
 a mailbox that opens towards the building for the mailman to pick up* 
and a light post right next to it. The other part of the corner has an 
ice cream stand with super duper rare and a box that could be used as a 
trash can or a box for the ice cream man to keep his stuff. The view of 
the outside into the first floor displays is amazing, you can see the 
mannequins with what looks like a bride and groom pair of suits or just 
some fancy outfits as well as the escalator and a display of some hats.<br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The first floor:</span><br>This
 is the clothing and random other unnamed things. There is, like I said,
 a mannequin display and hats but there is also a back door to a small 
outside covered area with a trash can. There is a counter with an old 
style cash register with the round part that should have the buttons and
 the lever but the stand has a flaw that is half made up for. The flaw 
is that the design leaves two studs that minifig cannot stand on but 
they still sick out and block the minifig from getting close to the 
stand, plus the fact that it is a high counter so it is hard for the 
customer and the clerk to reach. The display that causes this though is 
what half makes up for it because it is diamonds/gems(but you can't 
really see them).<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The second floor:</span><br>The second floor is not as 
cool as the first floor but hey, it's smaller. it is smaller because of 
the escalator guard that is unnecessarily large and takes up way more 
space than it should, that ought to be fixed, but the escalators more 
than make up for that. The cool plates and glasses that, for once do not
 have a purpose other than display or as pieces finally let you use 
these for your other houses or people. Other than these and the window 
that opens, and the awesome (formal form of ward, as in awe, not street 
use) display of artistry type work on the outside with the flags, there 
is only one more thing to discuss, another small flaw. The second floor 
flaw aside from the large railing(that is the third floor flaw, for 
reference) is that the walkway where the escalator comes off is only two
 studs wide so a minifig cannot walk there straight, which, along with 
almost every flaw, seems to largely effect the way this set can be made 
into a stop motion video set. OH YEAH, I forgot, the escalator, it is so
 much simpler than it looks and super easy to build and the best part of
 it, it has SEVEN(7) new 2010 pieces, woo hoo. These new pieces are like
 the so called ""cheese wedge"" or rather 1x1x2/3 slopes but it is two 
long so you don't need to put two together in MO-Cs and have that 
unattractive split in the middle, this piece will be handy in the 
future.<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>The third floor:</span><br>This floor has not two, but three 
displays that are Bouncy balls that are really zamor spheres, a doll 
house that looks a bit to me like the white and red creator house and a 
scooter that fits a small minifig perfect. The scooter has a nice thin 
design that is sleek, simple and fun. The escalator ends here but there 
is a skylight with, wait, what's that, hanging there, it can't be, no, 
IT IS; A CHANDELIER. The chandelier can be seen partially from the top 
corner window of the box picture and under the ""more images"" section up 
at the top of this page but the weird thing is that you cannot see it 
from that angle after you build the set, unfortunate. It has a 
surprisingly easy to make but hard to think of design that is simply 
magnificent. The gem at the bottom is just plain awesome. Three more 
things on this chandelier: it has a stick on it so it stays with the 
third floor when you take it apart and to be connected, there is a break
 in the pattern but it faces the wall, so whatever and lastly, the part 
that connects it to the wall will let it tilt upward and looks like a 
laser cannon sort of thing or you can make it 180 to face up and then 
rotate it to face it down so it moves to right next to the wall. Also, 
if i am not mistaken, this is the first modular house to not have a 
stair case to get to the roof, aw. Speaking of which...<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>The roof and other stuff:</span><br>Finally,
 the roof, real simple details with what I think is new pieces and 
cylinders with some awnings. Lots of room for almost anything that you 
can think of from a band on a rooftop to a bungee jumper. there are 
three main parts to the roof, first, the billboard. This billboard has 
everything a billboard possibly needs, a giant face, a 3D present, a new
 2x2 plate with one stud in the middle and a spot for the guy who 
changes them. The second roof part, the skylight, you may remember me 
talking about the skylight earlier but it is even more impressive from 
the top. It is two very large car windshields and a long flat element 
that needs it's own separate bag. It is sealed down tight but is not 
actually held by studs, but actually just held down by a total of five 
pieces. The part across the top is key because if you take it off, they 
still stay but they can slide out for whatever reason night you might 
need them to but it also provides a perfect spot for a sword fight over 
glass or a ""pit"" so to speak. The last and just about funniest part of 
the set, the window washer, I know, this is why you read the review, 
don't hate me for taking so long to get here.. Anyway, the window washer
 himself is a cute little guy with the same face as all the other people
 in the modular house sets (a clone O_O) and a little broom, he looks 
like the guy who would replace the billboard, handy, a two-in-one 
minifig. the window washer platform is small but handy and has a clear 
cup for him so he does not get thirsty and the plank that prevents him 
from falling off(for the most part) does not block him from standing on 
half the studs, yay. The one thing that bothers me about the platform 
though is that it cannot reach the second floor windows,<br>Well that concludes my review, except for the always important love em' or hate em' pros and cons.<br>Pros and Cons<br>---------<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cons:</span><br>---------<br>Not ideal for videos but can be somewhat fixed.<br>It

"GingerWookiee","2011-10-08T06:41:29.61Z","By Far the Best","This set, In my opinion, is by far the best Modular of the Line.<br><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Minifigures in this set are really nothing special, but they tie the set together in the way that if you got rid of them, the set wouldn't be half as good.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build, I found, Relativly easy once, as with all the modulars, you got past the paving outside. I don't think that this set is as challenging as the Fire Brigade, Yet it took me 2 days of building to complete.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model, wow what do I say. It is just Stunning. Abosoloutly Amazing. I love the seat in the changing room. I think the way the escalators are built is great. I has something I can't Quite put my finger on that realy puts it apart from the rest of the series.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this is a Brilliant set I recomend to everyone, even people who hate LEGO. This is such a great set, Its...Wow. Thats all I can say, I'm awestruck.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"PenguinFan","2011-06-06T02:47:29.263Z","A brilliant and realistic old fashioned department store!","<p>This is the first modular building I have bought after many years away from Lego. I chose this set as it looked so stunning, detailed and different. More like the buildings you see at a Legoland Park than in a normal lego set!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I have to say that I am really pleased with this set. Opening the box for the first time I was stunned with the amount of bricks included. Overall the set took almost two days to make (not non-stop building). I really took my time as this was a very fun build.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Stunning design, very detailed with lots of aspects that will make you smile when you build them.</li><li>The ground floor, shop front and outside areas are really nice. I especially liked the pillars around the shop windows, the revolving door, and the ice cream stand.</li><li>Lovely use of small green windows and cream brick to create an unusual and realistic design.</li><li>I love the shop window dummies. So great and funny!</li><li>The little window cleaner is great, and he even has a cup with him!</li><li>The roof skylight, chandelier, and escalators are just amazing designs. Hats off to the guy who thought of using each piece to create such intelligent arrangements of bricks.</li><li>Brilliant cash till and cabinets for gems and bottles.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The yellow 'shop' sign is a bit of a pain to arrange neatly. No matter how much I try it doesn't look as neat as the one on the box.</li><li>As mentioned by others, the billboard on the roof is a bit unstable. This is due to the design of the support beam. Perhaps using some technic elements would have helped?</li><li>The first and second floors are almost identical, and therefore rather boring to make. Real shame after the ground floor was such a fun build.</li><li>The interior of the ground floor could do with some floor tiles. It seems unfinished.</li></ul>
<p>The cons to this set are all minor really, as this is a brilliant set. I really enjoyed making it, even the&nbsp;repetitive&nbsp;first and second floors were more fun to make than most other sets. This is a really tall building, and making each floor and then putting it on the previously built ones gives a great sense of satisfaction. There is a lot of detail in this set, and some really clever design has gone into it. I recommend this set to anyone, child or adult alike. It's not too complicated, but has enough bricks and stages to make it a challenging build. Get it now!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,4
"skinnylawyer","2013-02-21T03:21:57.04Z","My minifigure alter ego shops till she drops!","<p>Set 10211, Grand Emporium, was the second Modular Building I got my hands on, back in early 2012. I went hurried through the building process before embarking on a weeklong trip out of town, so it wasn't until months after that I truly started enjoying this set and its elements, especially with other Modular Buildings I ended up adding to my collection. I really like this set, especially in terms of playability and configuration.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is nicely sized and has depictions of many different scenes that can be staged with the set. In particular, some of the display items, such as pants or toys, can also be used by the minifigures themselves as their own personal possessions, depending on the scene I want to stage.</p><p>Instructions were straightforward and easy to follow, with each of the three booklets covering each floor.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Lots of light tan and green for the most part. The color scheme is quite pleasant.</p><p>The roof level ledges use many one-stud wide parts in repetitive pattern, and they look quite awesome once the patterns are installed.</p><p>The transparent parts used for the skylight and for the top floor chandelier are awesome. Additionally, many 1x1 and 1x2 parts are used to build various merchandise items that are sold in the department store.</p><p>There is even a rotating door.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set comes with seven minifigures, all with the classic smiley as is the case for all Modular Building minifigures.</p><p></p><ul><li>Male mannequin: He has light beige hair (the kind of color more realistic on a mannequin than on a real human being) and wears a suit. He is displayed on the ground floor with the head facing backward to hide the printed face, but by turning the face out front, he can become another shopper or a model.</li><li>Female mannequin: She sports flowing brown hair and a funky wedding dress, using a sloped brick as the skirt. Like the male mannequin, the head is turned backward and hidden, but by turning the face forward, she can become an extra character.</li><li>Cashier: She looks great in a scarfed torso and white pants.</li><li>Boy: The blue vest/red-white striped shirt look is not all that special, but he is the one who can be staged eating the ice cream or riding the toy scooter.</li><li>Window washer: He wears a red/green overall outfit that were seen on two Winter Village minifigures as well. Because he also wears a hard hat, I like to stage him wherever I need to portray a construction site on another Modular set.</li><li>Male shopper: He comes with two different bottoms - a blue pair of pants, and a naked bottom except for black briefs. The instructions have him built with the naked bottom, and stage him inside the curtained cubicle (fitting room) on the ground floor holding the blue pants to try them on.</li><li>Female shopper: I like her bowed red sweater and white shirt with pink star patterns, not to mention the shiny heart necklace. I also love her black bob hair, which is similar to my own longtime hairstyle. She is my favorite minifigure of the seven - or from the entire Modular Buildings series for that matter; due to her resemblance to me, she is my designated ""Mini-Me"" in my Lego builds and staged accordingly for photo shoots (which I then upload to social media).</li></ul><div>I would've liked an extra minifigure, a girl, perhaps to look at the dollhouse in the toy section.</div><p></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Even though I built it rather hurriedly, it was enjoyable for the most part, especially as each element, from the rotating door base to the displays, came together.</p><p>The memorable mini-builds are the two escalators which connect the floors. Although static, they look realistic, and blend well into the rest of the building.</p><p>Other mini-builds include the ""SHOP"" sign at the main entrance as well as the chandelier. The ""SHOP"" sign is mounted on a bendable rod and mounted in a curved position, and getting it to look good and even is a bit of work. The billboard on the top is another great mini-build, complete with a minifigure head pattern.</p><p>The middle and top floors are mostly identical, and that makes the build process a bit repetitive. It was even more repetitive for me because I was building this set under a bit of time pressure - though because the two floors are similar, some of the steps were easier the second time around.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This being a corner set, it is a bit cramped, especially considering that it is a department store. Nevertheless given the space constraints, it does capture the feel of an old-fashioned department store fairly well, with three separate departments, a cashier, and ample interior light thanks to the atrium and the skylight.</p><p>Because two of the minifigures could be staged either as mannequins or as humans, and also because many merchandise items can be taken out of the store as personal belongings of the minifigures, there are lots of play possibilities. Adding even more possibilities are the ice cream cart on the sidewalk as well as the mailbox (which even comes with two 1x2 studless tile pieces with postage pattern, to represent letters).</p><p>The billboard is the main weak point of the completed model. The billboard mount column does not feel too stable despite being reinforced from all four sides by sloped bricks, and can wobble if I mistakenly push the billboard from one side. I still have to say the billboard looks great though.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a great set. This is clearly my favorite among the Modular Building sets, partly because it captures the essence of its subject the way a Modular Building should, partly because it looks good and has interesting design elements, and partly because one of its minifigures is my Lego doppelgänger. This set is the reason why I really got hooked on Lego again and spent a small fortune buying pricey sets throughout 2012.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Bricky_Dee_Williams","2014-05-17T02:51:41.397Z","Grand Indeed!","<p>The set is pretty good for price for piece, at US $150 and over 2,100 pieces. The set goes well with town and city sets, along with displays of many Lego themes. I personally love this set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is absolutely huge. It&#39;s about the same size as most other modular building boxes. But the bags fit quite tight inside. There are three instruction booklets included with the set, all of which are pretty easy steps to follow. Although, same as with the Fire Brigade, the steps include a lot of pieces per step. One step includes over 100 pieces in the same step, including 64 of one piece and 32 of another. Lego could have limited the pieces per step, but they didn&#39;t. No points lost</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with the other modular buildings, their is a vast range of all types and colors of pieces. This set, being a department store, includes so many different pieces. Some include pieces like gold plates, transparent green and white glasses, and jewels and different articles of Lego clothing, including torsos, an extra pair of pants, and two short legs; one purple, one blue. The skylight is made of two giant windshield pieces, and the chandelier is made with a bunch of tiny white crystals. The set, as all modulars do, comes with a large baseplate, a 32x32 tan baseplate. There are big windows and small window panes included with the set. It&#39;s just a great assortment of bricks and blocks.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There really isn&#39;t much to say about the minifigures. There aren&#39;t any special animals as with the pet shop. Each figure has a basic Lego smiley face, and the only truly different piece is their hairdos. One little boy also includes short legs, making the short leg count in the set three; two blue, one purple.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build, as with the others, is quite difficult, and took me many nights after school to construct. But it isn&#39;t ages 16+ for nothing. The build is a bit repetitive at times, like building the front windows or pillars that border them, or the escalators. But it is still a great build. The spinning door is fun to build, as it&#39;s three doors connected by propellers. The billboard on top is kind of like a Lego mosaic, and is fun to build. The tiny detailed dollhouse on the top floor &nbsp;is a fun little model to display in the toy floor, and the chandelier is also a great part to construct. It&#39;s a very challenging but very fun building experience.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model, as did the Fire Brigade, measures a little over fifteen inches, counting the billboard topper. The displays in the shop windows are a cool part of it to put on display. The model is compartmentalized&nbsp;into three floors and a roof. It&#39;s easy to take apart floor by floor. There is an escalator leading to each floor, and a back door. The revolving door spins easily, and, if built right, doesn&#39;t get caught on anything. The billboard is a bit wobbly on top, but doesn&#39;t come off too easily. And the window washer on the side is a great addition to the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A grand model indeed. The Grand Emporium is an amazing model, worthy of being added to any Lego collection. It&#39;s a complex model, well over 2,000 pieces. It takes up a lot of space. It easily connects to other buildings in the theme, and is a special corner building that will rotate the street view of your collection by ninety degrees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Looks great on the outside</p>

<p>-Splits easily into four sections</p>

<p>-Adds a lot of cool pieces to your collection</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Billboard on top is a bit shaky</p>

<p>-Small displays on the inside take up quite a bit of room in the model.</p>

"NYC231","2014-03-24T18:11:12.12Z","Grand Job LEGO!","<p>If you wondering whether or not to buy this set, I hope that my review can be of assistance to you!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very big for this set, as are all LEGO boxes for products over $100, and it is probably oversized for looks to make people buy it. The instructions are fairly easy to follow, and consist of 3 instruction packets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a very wide variety of parts. From the flowers out in front of the store to the giant &quot;glass&quot; skylight on the roof it sure seems like this set has it all. Even inside the store there is merchandise such as wine glasses and some toys.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes 6 mini figures:</p>

<p>- A female worker</p>

<p>- A female shopper</p>

<p>- A male shopper (That appears to have no pants on in the changing room!)</p>

<p>- A male kid&nbsp;</p>

<p>- A bride display&nbsp;</p>

<p>- A groom display</p>

<p>This set has a pretty good variety of mini figs that increase the playability of the finished set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Be prepared to work a while on this one. It usually takes me only one or two hours to complete a &quot;hard&quot; LEGO set so I thought maybe this set would take 4 or 5 hours to complete. Boy was I wrong. The detailing in this set was amazing, but in turn it took me three days to complete this set. (Working about 3 to 4 hours a day.) Alas, it was well worth the finished product.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model reminds me of a corner shop in New York City. It is amazing to look at on the outside, and just as intricate with detail on the inside. With cool details such as escalators and a chandelier just below the skylight, this building is really complete with no loose&nbsp;ends to make you ask, &quot;What in the world did they include this for?&quot;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set captures exactly what it&#39;s name suggests. It certainly is grand, and simply calling it a store doesn&#39;t do it justice; it is an emporium. You get a lot for you money with this set in my opinion. I believe my money was well spent!</p>

"lukethebrickdude","2015-10-31T10:11:45.277Z","An outstanding set; ruined only by a quirky construction.","<p>This set was my first modular building. In 2011, I found one on eBay which was an unwanted Christmas present and I got it for just &pound;90. It arrived and the box was in relatively bad shape; crumpled, crushed and a bit ripped; but I couldn&#39;t complain because I got it for nearly &pound;50 less than the original retail price.</p>

<p>I began building the first floor and I love it; I&#39;d never built anything like this before. I had previously been restricted to City and Creator but now I had found my deep love for complicated sets. The first floor was very detailed: changing rooms, fully-fledged till, ice cream cart, even an escalator!</p>

<p>I opened up the bags for the second floor and the construction went a bit... strange. The way it slotted onto the bottom layer when it was finished was weird and it was able to slide around somewhat. I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;d built&nbsp;it wrong. It wasn&#39;t too bad but I expected it to work a bit better. I still really like the details on the second floor and now I was ready to make up the third floor.</p>

<p>I laid out all of the pieces and began putting it together. The exterior was very much the same as the previous floor but the interior was quite different and the chandelier was beautiful, even though it took a few tries to complete properly. The roof was very finicky and was very hard to build. It wouldn&#39;t stay put and flexed inwards. I was quite disappointed with the roof because it was extremely fragile.</p>

<p>I do love this set; it&#39;s what introduced me to the modular buildings line and it&#39;s one of my favorite buildings. It&#39;s the only department store building from LEGO I know of and it would be hard to beat it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Good detail&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Realistic colour scheme</li>
	<li>Attractive design</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Fragile in places</li>
	<li>Fiddly build</li>
	<li>Becoming harder to find</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>So, should you buy this set? Well, I think that the only thing stopping you is the price tag. It&#39;s around &pound;250 BNIB now and will definitely go up in price very soon. If you want this set, buy it now because it is just following in the footsteps of Cafe Corner, Market Street, Green Grocer and Fire Brigade in terms of its pricing lifespan. Whilst it&#39;s certainly not the best LEGO set, it&#39;s high up on my favourites for all of the reasons I&#39;ve explained.</p>

Every city needs buildings and I finally had the chance to add&nbsp;10211-1: Grand Emporium to New Legorleans. I won&#39;t have a teaser here: get this set.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: As always with these Creator Expert sets, the minifigures are not the best. All very common parts and the standard smiley face. That said, the bride mannequin is really nice, with the wedge piece simulating the dress and train is very intricate and detailed. As an aside, I think a trans clear head for the bride and groom figures would&#39;ve been better than turning the yellow head around to the back. Sorta creepy to think about, maybe it&#39;s the Maitlans from Beetlejuice? Any way, enough with the figures.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: Bottom line, it was great. The blue and white inlay on the sidewalk just pops. The green half domes as awnings contrasted with the white window edges, agin just pops visually. The use of two black capes as a changing area screen was really nice touch and clever use of pieces for something new. The 3rd floor chandlier was nice as well and you can see how it inspired the Bank Bank version. I really love the window washer&#39;s scaffold and the rooftop billboard. They&#39;re ways to give life and variety to areas that can be forgotten. While the builds for the second and third floors are virtually the same, they don&#39;t feel repetitive.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, the four edifices on the first level are a tough slog. Very boring to stack the same pieces over and over again.&nbsp;The same for the two stairs/escalators. Not a fun part. The back of the building is a tiny cutout and totally forgettable. Also, there&#39;s no tiling in the interior. I usually add that to make the interior seem more real than the mere baseplate color.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s an open set that simply rests on each level. The 1x4 tile with studs on each end wasn&#39;t used yet, so it can feel a little unstable when handling the levels. Just be careful and it&#39;s not a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With that said, this is a jewel of a set. I wanted for a while and snagged a good price for it. However, it&#39;s tough to find this set at a reasonable price now. If you can get this, grab it.&nbsp;</p>
