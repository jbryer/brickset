Not much for a tenner here, folks.Anyway. My son loves it, has played with it since purchase and has even taken it to bed to put in his special drawer - you win again, LEGO! The double sided faces are a good idea as the minifigures are ready for any play scenario (Malfoy Death Eater face for example) and Dobby (I hate Dobby personally - Gollum rip-off) is great as a side-kick. It really could have done with another figure and yes, I know the scene is just the three of them.In summary. Good starter set, about £4 too expensive and needs just that something else to make it a little more playable - like the Star Wars Battle Packs.ps.

"pod120","2010-12-14T07:32:33.647Z","""Master has given Dobby a sock""","<strong>Introduction<br/></strong>&nbsp;<br/>This is one of six new 2010 HP sets, a line which many people thought had finished. Personally, I think that the new sets have a much greater extent of detail and attention to the books and films. All the minifigs have been completely redesigned. Obviously, LEGO have based these sets on multiple books/films in the series, as well as earlier LEGO set locations and events. The first incarnation of this set was released in 2002. I got this set for 20% off along with four of the other 2010 HP sets when these sets were first officially released.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Minifigures<br/></strong>&nbsp;<br/><strong><em>Harry Potter</em></strong> is the only minifig in this set that was not included in the first incarnation. No one seems to like this minifig all that much and this may be beacuse he is in all six of the new sets. He has a double-sided head with a smile and frown. Some people may think he looks too young, but think if any facial lines were added, his face may look to old or out of place for a minifig covering the ages between 11 and 17. He wears Gryffindor uniform which has back printing. Although it bothers some, I am not concerned about him having the original hair. Once again consider he is of multiple ages.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong><em>Lucius Malfoy</em></strong> is only in one of the new sets, besides <em>10217 Diagon Alley</em>. He has a double-sided head too. One side is his standard expression and the other is a rather detailed death eater mask. Having something like this in a set this small seems quite rare and may&nbsp;be another reason for someone to get this&nbsp;set.&nbsp;This is because&nbsp;this mask only came in&nbsp;one of the new sets before <em>10217 Diagon Alley</em>. Another interesting detail about this minifig is that he has a cape. Unfortunately, the cape has to be crumpled for this minifig to wear his hairpiece. The hairpiece however, does improve over the one previously used in the first incarnation of this set.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong><em>Dobby</em></strong> has not been seen in LEGO form since the first incarnation of this set. Some things can go without printing, but Dobby without eyes and flesh skin looks like he has an extreme lack of blood. I am concerned his eyes may easily scratch off, but of course I am not going to test that theory.&nbsp;This minifig is a sure improvement from the only other LEGO <em>Dobby</em>, and like <em>Lucius Malfoy</em>, his detail seems rare for a set this small. His head&nbsp;feels like it's half rubber, half plastic. Many people may get this set for its minifigs.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Creatures<br/></strong>&nbsp;<br/>spider<br/>&nbsp;<br/>This piece has been seen numerous times before in LEGO HP. It seems unusually big, but is rather detailed. It is good to see LEGO aren't just throwing in spiders of random colours like they have done before. This is the smallest of the 2010 HP sets, and therefore quite likely to be bought by a younger child, and to them the spider may be more interesting than what it is to others who buy this set.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Accessories</strong><br/>&nbsp;<br/>brown wand<br/>black wand<br/>black book<br/>sock<br/>brown broomstick<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Although there are only five accessories, I feel that it's rather generous for the set. The wands appear all the time in these sets and it is a bit disappointing that they haven't created a specialised piece or used one that is shorter. Their frequent appearance almost gets annoying sometimes, but they sort of have to be there. The book&nbsp;looks accurate, but does not have unique printings like&nbsp;many of the books in old HP sets had. I think this may have been because of LEGO's more realistic approach to these new sets. The sock makes me feel annoyed at LEGO for their lack of development, but the piece itself satisfies me. Everyone will have their own opinion about this. The inclusion of the broomstick allows for a younger child to explore LEGO broomstick flight, possibly for the first time. The broomstick is a harmless addition to the set.<br/><strong>&nbsp;<br/>Components</strong><br/>&nbsp;<br/>The archway uses a similar structural design to <em>4842 Hogwarts Castle</em> when it comes to adding detail. This is seen with the use of sand-green cone-shaped bricks used on top of flat brown bricks. The use of colours is also the same. I think that this is great on behalf of LEGO, because it allows this set to be seamlessly joined with <em>4842 Hogwarts Castle</em>. In basic terms, the archway offers no playability other than it's ""firing"" feature. Although it works reasonably well, it seems a bit out of place in some ways. A good thing about it is that it can be&nbsp;excluded without affecting the structure. What I find a negative, is that the arch is only one sided.&nbsp; The side shown on the box has great detail with stairs and flames and the other side is a dull grey with a sudden drop, no real detail and a massive pole. The archway is good when added to other sets, but on its own it heavily relies on it's minifigs to give it life.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Which Movie?</strong><br/>&nbsp;<br/>Although these sets cover multiple films, this set seems to be one which is more based on a scene, rather than a location. Because of this, there is no doubt that this set is based on the second film. However, the archway and minifigs probably all appear in at least one other film in the series.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Conclusion<br/></strong>&nbsp;<br/>The minifigs and archway show a good depth of detail, which progresses over older LEGO HP designs. The building experience is quite simple and doesn't allow for the builder to gain experience with interesting pieces, but this can't be said as a negative, because this is a small set. Many people may not find the range of pieces that interesting, but for the size of the set, I think they are quite good. This would mainly be the accessories and minifig pieces. The playability is dull and indicates that this set should be joined with others from the 2010 HP sets. The value for money, I felt was alright. I wouldn't pay that much for the archway, but I would probably pay more for a set with those minifigs.&nbsp;The reason I rated this&nbsp;set five was&nbsp;because it is good to see that LEGO can think beyond one set at a time and also because LEGO have done just about the best possible job they could do for this scene in the movie. The best things about this set for me are the use of similar design techniques&nbsp;to <em>4842 Hogwarts Castle</em>, the range of minifigs for a small set and the inclusion of accessories like the broomstick, which perhaps aren't necesary, but it's good LEGO included them anyway. The fact that there are no stickers is a positive. The main negative is the reverse side of the archway.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I would definetely suggest this to anyone with <em>4842 Hogwarts Castle</em>. I would also suggest that anyone with this set buy the castle to go with it. Of all of the 2010 HP sets, I think this set would be the one aimed most at younger children, as they would get more playability out of this set that older kids would. Also, they may have less money. If you don't have a lot of money and might only get one set, this set is alright as a stand alone, but so is <em>4737 Quidditch Match</em>, which offers more playability. The archway may act as a good entrance to the quidditch pitch.",TRUE,5,4,2,2,3
"J0rgen","2010-12-01T12:57:16.737Z","You've cost me my servant! 2.0","<p>The remake of 4731-Dobby's Release, is a pretty good one. It has re-done versions of both Dobby and Lucius Malfoy, in Malfoy's case, this is the second time he's been re-done. Dobby now has printing on his face, as well as back-printing. Lucius Malfoy has a new suit, his third and the same hair as in 4766-Graveyard Duel, the greatest improvement on the figure is the Death Eater mask on the back of his head, because of that addition, this set can be bought as an army-builder, who wouldn't want an army&nbsp;of Death Eaters? The only problem with that is that you need a lot of black hoods, which you don't get from this set. Oh yeah, you get Harry as well, torso has back-print and his head is two-sided, angry frown and stupid smirk.</p>
<p>Besides the minifigures, the obvious highlight of the set, there's a small archway, it's nicely made, but doesn't really fit in with any of the Hogwarts-renditions. There's an action-function included, meant to send Lucius Malfoy flying, when he tries to curse Harry. It works, but it's not that great. There's a broomstick, a snitch and a spider included, that's because this is the cheapest of the new Harry Potter sets and it's meant to be a starter set for new fans.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"galonschiente","2010-12-16T19:33:56.17Z","'You will not harm Harry Potter!'","<p>This set is very special to me, as it is the first set I have build or had any interaction with for a long time. It was an even longer period of time because I had to order this set from the LEGO website. The delivery was also a grueling wait, because of all the snow that held up deliveries.</p>
<p>This will be split into sections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigures</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harry Potter - Ah, the boy who lived and titular character, this Harry fig is my first peach Harry and second harry, overall. Many a reviewer find this figure bland, perhaps because he is so common, coming in every set in the 2010 range, and most of the older sets, but I am not one of them. A few changes have been made to this minifig. First of all, and the most obvious one, is that he is now peach. He was peach in the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' to 'Order of the Pheonix' sets, but I consider it a change, albeit an old change. The second is that he now has a double-sided head. Side No. 1 is a happy, merry Harry who doesn't have a care in the world. Side No. 2 is a determined expression. The third change is that he now doesn't have a cape/robe that he used to have in the older sets. This set is a Year 2 set from 'Chamber of Secrets' where harry still wore robes. I guess thay are trying to make him more mature, like he has been in the recent films. Change 4 is that he has black trousers instead of his old grey trousers. </p>
<p>He of course has his trademark scar, glasses and hair he has kept for years.</p>
<p>His sweater has a Gryffindor insignia sewn onto it, with a house tie peeking out from his neck. His back printing is just creases in his sweater.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harry Potter - 5/5!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy - Father of that spoilt Slytherin brat, Draco Malfoy, Lucius is one spectacular fig (even if he is the worst in the set.) In the older 'Dobby's Release' set, he had long, straight, blonde hair. Since then, his hair has been buffed up on steroids. It is nice and thick, and fairly long, too. His face is a quite standard 'Mean Teacher' look, which is very detailed.&nbsp;He has a scowl, because he hates Harry Potter. If you rotate his head around, there is a surprise waiting for you. Lucius' shiny Death eater mask, which is quite menacing. Something that doesn't make sense is that this set was from the second movie. However, Lucius ws not revealed to be a Death Eater until the fourth in the series, 'Goblet of Fire'.</p>
<p>He has black cape.</p>
<p>His jacket&nbsp;is black and brown with some shiny silver lace coming horizontally across. Lucius is the only fig in this set to not have back printing.</p>
<p>He has black trousers.</p>
<p>The only flaw with Lucius is that his cape kinda has a point at the top, just sticking out, banging against his hair, causing it to slightly hover above his scalp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy - 4/5!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dobby the house elf - Probably the coolest minifigure in this set by far. When I first saw online images of Dobby, his head looked like plastic, but upon closer inspection it is actually very detaild rubber, unlike the old Dobby hed which was, quite frankly, rubbish.</p>
<p>He has adorable, big, green eyes, and massive ears. The most impressive aspect about his face is that he has a nose surpassing even those of people in the Lloyds TSB adverts.</p>
<p>He wears&nbsp;a pillowcase as a shirt, (because that's all Lucius, his master, will allow him to wear) but thankfully it covers his privates, because he doesn't wear any pants. He has a knot tied over his shoulder to prevent it from falling and risking major embarassment in public.</p>
<p>His pillowcase is all dirty, scruffy, wrinkled and probably extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He has short beige legs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dobby the house elf - 5/5!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accessories - You get two wands, a brown one and a black one for Harry and Lucius respectively. They are just two poles. 5/5!</p>
<p>A cool accessory is the broomstick, which is my first one. It is brown and LEGO has layered the head of the broom very well. This broom could possibly be the 'Nimbus 2000' Harry's signiture broom from the first three films. 5/5!</p>
<p>Another cool accessory is the spider, whose pincers can actually hold things. I am unsure which species of spider this is but it has a cross marking on it's bum, so it might be a holy spider. 5/5!</p>
<p>Tom Riddle's diary is included in the set however it has been downgraded significantly. The old version was brown,&nbsp;had a printed spine (I think) and had an ink blot in the middle. The new model is just a black book. 3.5/5!</p>
<p>Harry's magical sock of freedom is a part of the set. For Dobby to be freed from Malfoy's control, he has to be given an item of clothing, so Harry tricks Malfoy into giving Dobby the sock, hidden in side the diary. 5/5!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set - The actual set seems to be in a hallway of some sort. there are two chimnies, which are conical lime peices and some torches which are simply nothing more thn naked flame stick out of cones. there is a golden stud on the wall, along with the spider and broom mentioned before.</p>
<p>The play feature is ever so satisfying. You stand a minifig (preferably Lucius) on the designated area, then push a technic peice round the back of the set, sending them packing. I think it's supposed to replicate the scene on the box - Dobby electrocuting Lucius into oblivion. It can get old but stays satisfying nonetheless!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set - 4/5!</p>
<p>Play feature - 4/5!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total score - 45.5/50!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend you buy this set if you can find it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My next review won't be until after Chrimbo, so hope you enjoyed!</p>

"legospongepotter","2010-11-24T20:41:50.703Z","""You lost me my servant, boy!"" - Lucius Malfoy ","Well you can't always have a servant, Lucius. Anyways, to the review. I thought this was a good set! I never meant to buy it, but I had eleven bucks when I saw it at Walmart and thought, what the heck? So I bought it and do NOT regret it. I'll start with the Minifigs.&nbsp;<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>You get Harry Potter, Lucius Malfoy, and Dobby the House-Elf. I'll start with Dobby.</div><div><br></div><div>Dobby - Dobby's head seems to be made of material other than the normal Lego head plastic. It's softer. His ears stick out, like his nose, mouth, and eyes. His eyes are green and more realistic. His neck seems to be taller than usual. Now, his torso looks like a tied up rag on the front, all messy, just like a filthy pillowcase. It's tan and matches part of the real set. His arms are normal skin-tone. His legs are tan and short, so you can't move them. He comes with a sock and a black book, Tom Riddle's Diary. His sick is basically a 1x2 smooth tan piece with an image of a gray sock on it. It fits into the diary easily. Okay, so now I'll move on to Lucius.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Lucius Malfoy - Lucius has a black wand and cape. His blond hair is long, it stretches to his elbows. It ruffled and interesting, first time I've seen hair like it. On his head, he has a normal face that is as usual mean and unsatisfied. On the other side of his head you can a silver/gray Death Eater mask. It has good detail but is small. It doesn't cover much of his face, just his eyes, nose, and mouth. But its my first Death Eater. His torso is an elegant suit with many designs, obviously showing he's rich. His legs are a normal black, nothing special. Now, I have one complaint about this minifigure. His hair sometimes pops off literally because of his cape. However, it doesn't always happen, its more like 25 percent of the time.</div><div><br></div><div>Harry Potter - Ah, the Chosen One. This is my first and only flesh-toned Harry, and my second ever. He has messy black hair which is great. His head is also double-sided. One is a smily, happy, friendly face. The other is a frown, like Draco Malfoy just showed his ugly face. Or he's in battle with Lord Voldemort. is scar is bright red. He comes with a brown wand like normal. His torso is a Gryffindor uniform. Not really robes but more like a shirt/sweater. It's gray with a blue shirt and red tiew underneath. The gryffindor elbem is seen just below his heart. His legs are the same as Lucius, black. I think gray may have been better....But awesome minifigure! Now for the set itself.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Archway&nbsp;</h4><div>It's good. Nice detail. It's not much, kind of crowded, but what can you do?</div><div>On the top is a green roof with pieces I've never seen before (Note: I only have two Harry Potter sets, they're probably in other sets) and a gold stud on one side. On the other is a spider hanging by wall (good thing Ron isn't here) and my first HP broom. There are some flames and on top its a circular shape. You can fit a Minifg in there. You can put Malfoy on a brown piece in the front and push a red pushing piece/thing. He will fall of and fly forward. And it works! That's really it for the archway and the whole set.</div><div><br></div><div>So a great set, I would recommend this set to any Harry Potter fan, collector of great Minifgures, or anyone who likes small sets that are firm and can be moved easily. Buy this set!</div><div><br></div><div>Oh yeah, if you liked my review for this, next month any time from December 2 - 8 look for a review for Hagrid's Hut, and a big review early next year (maybe) of the Lego Hogwarts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4

It is a remake of Dobby's Release in 2002, but I was very young then, and probably didn't know there were any LEGO Harry Potter sets then! Anyway, I'll give you my review now:</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions - 9/10</h4><p>This is a small box, but with only 70-odd pieces it wasn't going to be big anyway. The instructions are clear and easy to follow<br></p>
<h4>Parts - 8/10</h4><p>There are some very cool parts, like the sock tile, and the flame things. It includes another spider, and another broom, and some gold 1x1 small round tile (the ones that are 1/3 the height of standard bricks), which I think is a Snitch, but I am not too sure.</p>
<h4>Minifigures - 9/10</h4><p><b>Harry Potter - 8/10</b></p><p>Another Harry Potter, in Hogwarts Uniform. I'm not complaining, I might want to make a clone army of Harry in the future!</p><p><b>Lucius Malfoy - 9/10</b></p><p>This is a cool minifigure. He has blonde Dumbledore hair, and I love his face, with the Death Eater mask on the back. His torso printing is quite cool aswell.</p><p><b>Dobby - 10/10</b></p><p>This is the best minifigure of the set. His head is so cute, and the torso printing is exquisite aswell, it really looks like him.</p>
<h4>The build - 8/10</h4><p>This was a very easy build, what with it being only 73 pieces. It took me about 5 minutes, if I'm honest, but I don't care.</p>
<h4>The completed model - 9/10</h4><p>It has a really cool little doorway, where you can put a minifigure on the step, and push the lever, and it sends the minifigure flying, which I think is a good playability feature :D</p>
<h4>Summary - 43/50 = 8.6/10</h4><p>All in all, a fantastic set, especially if you have a very low budget. It is an enjoyable set, and I won't be getting rid of this for a very long time! :D</p><p><br></p><p>I hope this review has come in handy, incase you were contemplating buying this set, in that case I would definitely recommend it :D</p><p><br></p><p>Matt</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,4
"Sethro3","2016-12-29T16:45:05.36Z","Master has given Dobby a sock?","<p>Getting back into LEGO in 2010 and witnessing Harry Potter sets made me happy. Not every set is a winner, but I think overall this set conveys the scene in Chamber of Secrets quite well.</p>

<p>You can look at this set from a few standpoints.</p>

<p>1: It has some interesting pieces to either add on to a larger Hogwarts building, or can be used for many other creative ideas. I don&#39;t love the dark blue-gray stripe under the archway, but the rest works really well together.</p>

<p>2: It has a simple, yet fun play feature. By placing the figure on the reddish brown modified tile and pushing in the axle, you can make Lucius Malfoy fly back, just like in the movie! Great fun for kids, I&#39;d imagine.</p>

<p>3: The minifigure selection is okay, especially for the price. While you do get Harry and Malfoy in other sets, Dobby is unique to this set. And love him or hate him, you need this figure for your collection. Plus, you can use Harry&#39;s torso for other students. And you could technically re-use Malfoy as a common Death Eater if you turn his head around and put on a hood.</p>

<p>Taking any of the above into consideration, I&#39;d say this set is a must have, especially at the right price. The aftermarket is a bit higher now compared to when it was on the shelves though.</p>

"thejoker34","2012-08-18T11:20:52.713Z","Master has given Dobby a Sock!","I am a huge fan of the Lego Harry Potter line, and when I saw this on clearance at Walmart, I couldn't resist! It is the ""small set"" of the Harry Potter bunch, and while it isn't much, its a nice little addition to any Harry Potter collection.<div><br></div><div><h4>Box and Instructions</h4><div>The box is (wait for it)...a box! It displays the little corridor/doorway that is the main part of the set, and of course, dobby doing that strange sort of Sith Lightning thing to Lucius Malfoy like he does in the movie. The back shows the different play features, as most lego boxes do, and shows the fact that you can switch Lucius Malfoy's head to a Death Eater Mask. The box isn't anything to special, but it isn't misleading or anything like that. The instructions had no mistakes, and was fairly easy to follow.</div><p><br></p><h4>Minifigures</h4><div>The Minifigures in this set are good, but not great.</div><div><br></div><div>I'll start with Dobby. The Dobby Minifigure is basically the only real draw for buying this set, as there are about a thousand oppurtunities for getting the other two figures. However, Dobby is quite a spectacular figure. His head is a new mould, and it's actually kind of cute. His torso has front and back printing of Dobby's ""sack"" that he wears around as a sign of his enslavement. His legs are the shorter kind that are not able to be moved, and have no printing. He is a nice figure and pretty fun to play with.</div></div><div><br></div><div>The next Minifigure we get is Harry Potter in his school uniform. I don't really care to much for this figure, as we get him in nearly every other Harry Potter set (even if we don't get this variant of Harry Potter, we get one in his street clothes). He comes with the average brown wand, and has all the details that are on the plethora of Harry Potter figures.</div><div><br></div><div>The final minifigure that we get is Lucius Malfoy. I actually like this figure, If only we didn't get him so many times. It's nice that we can turn around his head and get his Death Eater mask, however this Lucius does not come with a hood, so you can't mod him into a normal Death Eater. He comes with a black wand and a black cape. And with that, we have covered the Minifigures!</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div>Building the doorway is easy and doesn't take very long at all. Follow the instructions and you'll be done in 10-20 minutes easily. However, you can't exactly expect a detailed build for a 11.00 73 piece set, so I'm fine with the building experience.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Completed Model</h4><div>The little doorway is just, well, a doorway. One side has a broomstick and a spider on it, the other one has a golden stud for a little bit of detail. It has two torches and a play function where you push a lever sort of thing and Lucius Malfoy can go flying, so that you can mimic the scene where Dobby uses his magic to defend Harry. The model is basically 3 steps and an archway over the top. One little minor bother is that you can see the bright red lever (for the play function) sticking out the back quite easily. Lego doesn't show that in any box art, and it's a bit annoying, so tuck it away somewhere where the back won't be seen. Another thing is that it would have been nice to have the oppurtunity to attatch it to Hogwarts, but unfortunately, you aren't able to. The model includes Tom Riddle's Diary, and a sock piece for Dobby, to increase playability, but there are really only so many times you can reenact this scene.</div><div><br></div><h4>Summary</h4><div>Overall this is a nice little addition to the Harry Potter collection, even if it is a bit small. I'd recommend buying this set if you're a Harry Potter collector, especially if you can find it on any sort of clearance or sale!</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

"Odeinoichus","2012-01-21T16:39:52.59Z","Freeing Dobby Comparison with Dobby's Release","<p>Set #4736 Freeing Dobby: As someone who also once owned Dobby's Release from 2002 and who has reviewed that set I have decided to make a comparison with that set for this review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right off the bat the price is a much higher price compared to the original Yellow Mini-Fig version. We have a total of 73 pieces which is 3 more than the original set. (Considering there is one extra Mini-Figure in the set that makes sense.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model built with most of the pieces in this set is an archway for a window at Hogwarts' Castle, this is slightly better than the original build from Dobby's Release, which featured a small table and window/wall section of the castle. But still, it's just a basic model to include with the Mini-Figs of the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy is a much better interpretation of the original set's Lucius, he has a much nicer torso&nbsp;with darker coloring and a wonderful print, he also includes a unique blonde hair piece instead of the typical blonde female Mini-Fig hairpiece. It does look a little strange though, you can see a bit&nbsp;too much of his forehead in my opinion making him look as though he's beginning to&nbsp;go bald, his hairline is receding. He includes a nice black cloth cape and a black wand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harry Potter is included this time with the set and is your same basic Mini-Figure from most of the newer Harry Potter sets, with the double sided head and&nbsp;torso printing, and&nbsp;he now has black instead of grey pants legs. Lucius also has a double sided head, with a death eater mask on the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dobby is much more detailed in his head piece, there is painted eyeballs, and an overall better looking head sculpt compared to the original. His torso is roughly the same looking,&nbsp;from what I can see, but the print is crisper and nicer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also recieve a printed tile with a sock, a broom, a black spider and a black book. Now here is where I have a&nbsp;slight problem with the set, the original 2002 release&nbsp;included&nbsp;Tom Riddle's Diary with a unique printing on it that showed the black ink stain and the spot where it was stabbed by the&nbsp;Basilisk fang. This&nbsp;set however just includes a single plain, non-printed black book piece to represent Riddle's Diary. I'd say the original set did a better job of the diary, and if possible you should track down that original diary piece to use in&nbsp;conjunction with this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I'd stongly suggest that you get this set for the great Mini-Figs, but I would say it'd be a better deal (at least in Canada) if you bought it on sale. Regular price is the same as a Battle Pack, but you only get three Mini-Figures and&nbsp;basic, easily found in other sets, accessories. The added gimmick for launching Lucius is a better play feature than the original set had, but&nbsp;still I feel that it should have had at least the same Tom Riddle Diary piece with the unique printing and perhaps, for the price, they could have added an Albus Dumbledore Mini-Figure or perhaps Cornelius Fudge the Minister for Magic. (Just to make it equal in price with the Battle Packs who give you roughly the same number of pieces, but four Mini-Figures in each set. Plus Cornelius Fudge isn't available in any Harry Potter sets.)&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"sortinghatsmells567","2011-04-02T22:44:21.447Z","Lego has given Dobby an AWESOME set!","<p>Dobby's release was a great set, and now we get a remake! People don't appreciate the mini sets like they should, and this set is the perfect example. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the box, it really draws you in. I have only one complaint: Lego should really make possible pictures. If a box is adequate you should be able to recreate it without any kind of photo editing. This does not apply to vehicles, backgrounds, or flying characters, but it does to elf magic, making this a zero.</p>
<p>Box: 0/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The instructions are clearly labeled and tell you how to build the set perfectly. It also tells you the moving part in the set. Honestly, I wouldn't&nbsp;know what that rod in the back was unless I used the instructions.</p>
<p>Instructions 5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some pretty good parts in here. We have five of those green bricks that I like. The color is very pleasing to the eyes to me. We also have some good ol' fire bricks. I guess they're not that rare, but I think they're a good collector's piece. We have a spider piece in the set. That's been around for a while, but it's unique. What makes this recongnizable as a CoS set is Tom Riddle's diary and the new sock brick, so that's great. The last notable piece is a broom piece. I still think that Lego should make a way for the minifigs to ride the broom, but I'm happy with what I've got.</p>
<p>Parts 4/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Harry Potter</em>: He wasn't in Dobby's Release, but he's here now, so let's do some analyzing: He's got the Hogwarts uniform with the Gryffindor seal on it. He also has a double-sided head: one face determined, the other relaxed.&nbsp;His face still makes him look like he's in first-year, not a good thing. Also,&nbsp;the hair looks too&nbsp;big on his head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Dobby</em>:&nbsp;The thing that&nbsp;makes this set awesome. Dobby has short legs, and and he's wearing rags. The major improvement is his head, though. First of all, it's skin color alot better than the yellow used in Dobby's release. It has prints this time too, so he doesn't look... well, undead. They do, however, peel off very easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Lucius Malfoy</em>: Great minifig. He has a blond Dumbledore hairpiece that really suits him. It looks like he is wearing black robes, and he is complete with a black Death Eater wand. His face is very generic for a minifigure, it is very familiar-looking, but it fits his personality. Turn it around to reveal a menacing looking Death Eater mask!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigures 3/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Building Experience</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lame, (it took five minutes) but that's not what I was looking for. I wanted it for my brother, who loved Dobby, and for the minifigs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building Experience 2/5</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me and my brother enjoyed launching Lucius through the air.(and later, into the Vanishing Cabinet.) Once you start playing with the set, you realize that Lego didn't make this&nbsp;set for building, it was for playing with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freeing Dobby is a good set any Harry Potter fan, especially collectors. If you aren't a HP fan I wouldn't go for this, but it's still a great set.</p>
