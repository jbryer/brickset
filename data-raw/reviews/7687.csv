"J0rgen","2010-10-06T18:00:38.27Z","Quidditch Through the Ages: Comparing 4726 & 4737","<p>Even though it's easy to think so, this isn't a remake of 4726 as that was called Quidditch PRACTICE. Still, it's pretty much the same set, but that's ok as 4726 was one of my favorite sets as a young Potter fan. It has three of the same minifigures, Potter, Malfoy &amp; Hooch which have been remade brilliantly, except for Harry. In addition the set also contains the captains of both Quidditch teams: Oliver Wood and Marcus Flint. The players have new quidditch robes, with dark green(new)&nbsp;and dark red capes. Malfoy, Potter and Hooch has double printed heads, Malfoy has, in addition to his smirk, a&nbsp;bewildered face. Madame Hooch has goggles in addition to her regular face. Harry has a grin on one side and an angry face on the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quidditch field consists of a set of goal posts(three) a Ravenclaw spectator stand and a platform with the quidditch cup on it. I'm planning on buying three more of this set because then I'll have a set of goal posts on each side(and two on ebay) four spectator stands and two complete teams, with an extra each(if they don't end up on ebay).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should think this set has a lot of playability, based on my experience with 4726. You can swoosh the players around on their broomsticks or test your aim with the catapult. A great, small set, even though I'd like a Limited Edition with all four house teams and a complete quidditch field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to make a complete Years 2-3 Quidditch field: Collect four 4737 Quidditch Match, use the spectator stands, the goal posts and the players. You get Oliver Wood and Harry Potter for the Gryffindor team and Draco Malfoy and Marcus Flint for Slytherin. To complete your Gryffindor team you'll need Fred and George Weasley from the upcoming Diagon Alley set, as they are the Gryffindor beaters. The Gryffindor chasers are three girls, I'm going to use the Indy babes, but any skin-coloured girls will do. For the rest of the Slytherin team, find some angry, evil-looking male minifigures and you'll do fine. If you want more spectator stands you can use&nbsp;a couple&nbsp;from 4726 Quidditch Practice, You might want to build some elevated benches in addition to the towers, to fit more spectators.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

"pod120","2010-12-04T10:08:01.597Z","""I like this ball""","<strong>Introduction</strong><br/>&nbsp;<br/>This is one of six new 2010&nbsp;HP sets, a line which many people thought had finished. Personally, I think that the new sets have a much greater extent of detail and attention to the books and films. All the minifigures have been completely redesigned. Obviously, LEGO have based these sets on multiple books/films in the series, as well as earlier LEGO set locations and events. The first incarnation of this set was released in 2002.&nbsp;I got this set for 20% off along with four of the other 2010 HP sets when these sets were first officially released.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Minifigures<br/></strong>&nbsp;<br/><strong><em>Harry Potter</em></strong> is one of many of the new minifigs to have a double-sided head. One side is a&nbsp;smile and the other side is a frown. Although this minifigure shows great detail, the excitement wears thin from&nbsp;the character&nbsp;being in all six sets.&nbsp;The quidditch uniform is good though, and evolves from the previous design. Many complain about him having the original hairpiece. I don't know what to say to this because it doesn't bother me. I like how his hands have been coloured brown to represent gloves. He also has a cape which covers the back of the torso, which&nbsp;I don't believe has&nbsp;back printing.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong><em>Draco Malfoy</em></strong> wears the same quidditch uniform as <em>Harry</em>, with the colours and house crest being that of Slytherin. I believe he has a new hairpiece which is also used for<em> Fenrir</em> <em>Greyback</em>. Like <em>Harry</em>, he has a double-sided head, with one side a smirk and the other a scared expression. Like&nbsp;other important child characters in the series, he is included in two of the new sets.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong><em>Rolanda&nbsp;Hooch</em></strong> wears a quidditch umpire's uniform which looks very similar to the previous design. She also has a double sided head. One side with goggles and one without. The side without has completely amber eyes with no obvious pupils, which I think looks weird, but is not really a negative. She has grey gloves and like all the other minifigs in this set, she has a cape. This is the only one of the new sets that includes this character and only the second time this character has been in a LEGO set.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong><em>Oliver Wood</em></strong> is completely identical to the <em>Harry</em> minifig in this set, except for face an hair. The face and hair are quite simple. This&nbsp;means that this minifig could probably be treated as a random Gryffindor player. I mean this as a positive and if you have this set you can use the minifig however you wish. The character may be important in this set, as he is the Gryffindor captain. His character has only been seen in LEGO form&nbsp;in this set.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong><em>Marcus Flint</em></strong> is completely identical to the<em> Draco</em> minifig in this set, except for face and hair. Like the <em>Wood</em> minifig, this one could be used as a quidditch random or the team captain. His character also has never been seen in LEGO form&nbsp;before this set. The previous incarnation of this set had the same minifigs, but <em>Wood</em> and <em>Flint</em> were absent.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Creatures<br/></strong>&nbsp;<br/>This is the only 2010 HP set that does not include any animals.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Accessories<br/></strong>&nbsp;<br/>brown broomstick (3)<br/>black broomstick (2)<br/>beater's bat (2)<br/>quidditch helmet (2)<br/>quaffle (2)<br/>bludger (3)<br/>golden snitch<br/>quidditch chest<br/>quidditch trophy<br/>red [Gryffindor] cone (4)<br/>green [Slytherin] cone (4)<br/>&nbsp;<br/>This set has quite a good range of accessories. Unlike the other new HP sets, it does not feature the accessories that repeat, but features ones which are related to the game of quidditch. Many of the accessories were included in the first incarnation, but many more have been added this time around. These would include beater's bats, quidditch helmets, quidditch trophy, red and green cones and more broomsticks, quaffles and bludgers. The cones are shown to sit next to the catapults as if they were extra projectiles. I recently figured that they could be placed on the 2x4 flat brown brick as a scoring system, as they are coloured for the corresponding teams. The quidditch chest can fit all four&nbsp;match balls, but it is a bit of a fiddle to be able to close the chest. The World Racers trophy is an excellent addition to the set and it is good to see LEGO added this in, even though it does not make an obvious appearance in any of the films. It is unfortunate that scratches still appear in the broomsticks after being clasped in a minifig's hand. I would have thought LEGO would have done something about that by now. The accessory that I do have a problem with is the golden snitch. The first incarnation of this set used a single stud as well, but it was a chrome gold. It seems that eight years of progress took LEGO back a step here.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Components</strong><br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>The&nbsp;spectator stand</strong>&nbsp;is great. It is something that many would say is too small, but I think it is a good size, especially when compared to the other 2010 HP sets. Although the blue does indicate Ravenclaw, I am not sure if Ravenclaw was the reasoning for it being blue, as colours green, red and yellow are cleverly used elsewhere on the set. The blue and grey bricks give the illusion of cloth being draped over wood. The shape is an improvement from the first incarnation. The hole in the bottom acts as a good entrance arch and area to fly through on a broomstick. Some people would complain that&nbsp;the top&nbsp;can only seat one or possibly two minifigs. This does not bother me, as the tower's size matches the rest of the set. The circular 2x2&nbsp;flat beige brick works well enough as a seat and the 2x4 flat brown brick has its own purpose, which I already mentioned. The flag on top and green base add to set's appearance.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>The hoops</strong> have their positives and negatives. One of the good things about them is that they vary, having three different heights. Another is that their size matches the rest of the set, which for some people may even be a negative. Lastly, the gold hoops look quite good and appearance-wise, they&nbsp;progress over the previous incarnation of the set. The first of two negatives is the vertical structure. I don't know why LEGO used 1x1 round bricks instead of a rod, as the structure would have been stronger and possibly look more realistic. The only reason I can think of for&nbsp;using those&nbsp;pieces is colour variation. The poles for the hoops also seem rather thick. The other negative is basically the piece used for the hoop. Somehow it feels like the piece has been bent further than it is supposed to,&nbsp;like one of the ends is going to pop out the hole it was pushed into. The process of connecting the hoop to the brick was not very easy and was difficult and tedious to adjust. However, the cone-shaped piece at the bottom of the pole and the green base add to set's appearance.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>The catapults</strong> seem like more of a play feature rather than a book or film reference. They are not a necessity and can always be excluded. Although they may be the main source of enjoyment in this set for some people, they aren't for me. The only thing I will say is they do look good but cannot really be controlled to adjust height and accuracy. They are a good addition, but do seem to be an extra and are not designed particularly for this set. A positive is that you get two, one for each team.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>The trophy stand</strong> is the only component that was not in the first incarnation of this set. it is a valued addition to the set, but there isn't really much to say about it. It has enough room to stand a minifig if the trophy is removed. The flags and green baseplate add to its appearance.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Which Movie?<br/></strong>&nbsp;<br/>As the sets cover multiple films, this set could be from any HP film that has a&nbsp;Hogwarts quidditch match. I know that <em>Oliver Wood</em> and <em>Marcus Flint</em> only appear in the first&nbsp;and second&nbsp;films and that <em>Rolanda Hooch</em> only appears in the first. <em>Draco</em> only directly appears in a quidditch match in the second film and I have never seen the quidditch trophy in any of the movies. The box art shows weather conditions that are similar to the weather conditions during the quidditch scenes in the first and second films. With&nbsp;the above references, I would think that this set is mostly based on the first,&nbsp;or more likely&nbsp;second HP film.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>&nbsp;<br/>Like all the new 2010 HP sets, this set shows a greater depth of detail in the construction of the set and the minifigs compared to older HP sets. The building experience is very simple, except for the construction of the hoops. Fortunately, there are no stickers. The range of pieces is excellent. If all the new 2010 HP sets had the same accessories as this set, the sets&nbsp;would get boring, but most of the accessories seem fairly unique. As for the other parts, there is a good range of colours for a small set. For its size, this set probably has the&nbsp;best playability among the 2010 HP sets. When the playability and range of pieces is considered, I think this set has a decent value for the cost. The best things about this set for me are the range of colours, excess of quidditch equipment, the absence of stickers,&nbsp;amount of minifigs and the fact all five have capes. The two&nbsp;main negatives for me are the hoops and that having only three can't really create a ""match"" situation.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I would suggest this set to anyone with <em>4842 Hogwarts Castle</em>, as it will go well on the castle grounds. I think the the arch in <em>4736 Freeing Dobby</em> would serve as a good entrance to the quidditch pitch. Obviously, anyone who wishes to make a full size quidditch match or collect all six 2010 HP sets will get this set. If you have little money and may only get one set, I would suggest spending a little more&nbsp;buying this set, rather than buying <em>4736 Freeing Dobby</em> for playability reasons.",TRUE,5,4,3,4,4

"AETerry","2011-04-27T16:01:08.977Z","Quidditch Match","<p>At $19.99, there's a good ammount of minifigures to be had in a set of this size with five, all of them named characters&nbsp;from a book/movie series too. With the 2010 &amp; 2011 Harry Potter sets, there's a quality here now to the sets that I'm willing to pick them up versus before where, they just didn't appeal to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the Harry Potter series, minifigures included are&nbsp;Rolanda Hooch, Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, Marcus Flint and Oliver Wood. All of them have a broom to fly on. Oliver and Marcus have bludgers for knocking away balls from making a score. And Harry Potter is holding a small gold 1x1 round flat plate to act as the Golden Snitch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal posts are a decent enough build with a rubber element so you can bend it around to create the hoops. Catapults to help simulate the flying bludgers and balls going through the air. </p>

<p>There's a small stand for the Trophy to sit on and be awarded to the winning team. Chest to hold the balls and helmets.</p>

"wander099","2011-05-22T08:49:06.7Z","Excellent minifigures included!","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The front of the box shows a Quidditch match in progress and there is a similar picture on the back.&nbsp; Also on the back is a picture demonstrating the function of the catapults, which appears to be launching the bludgers at players.&nbsp; You get a single instruction booklet.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some parts of note in this set.&nbsp; Specifically, there is some Quidditch equipment included.&nbsp; You get four broomsticks, two helmets, two beaters bats, two quaffles (one extra), and three bludgers (one extra).&nbsp; I was disappointed that the balls were not completely solid and had a hole in one side.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigure selection in this set is definitely above average both in number and what was chosen to be included.&nbsp; The set includes: Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, Marcus Flint, Oliver Wood, and Madam Hooch.&nbsp; <br></p><p>Harry and Wood are dressed in Gryffindor Quidditch robes with white pants, while Draco and Flint are dressed in Slytherin robes also with white pants.&nbsp; The Quidditch robes are better designed than in the previous Quidditch Practice set.&nbsp; Flint and Wood are also exclusive to this set.&nbsp; Also, this set includes new hair for Draco, which is the best hair I have seen on him yet-it looks just like in the movies.<br></p><p>The new Madam Hooch figure is quite similar to the previous version, but has flesh coloured skin, a new hair piece, and a double-sided head (one with goggles and one without).&nbsp; This is the first appearance of this figure since 2002 and a must-have for any LEGO Harry Potter collector.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was largely simple, however, I did have a significant amount of difficulty when it came to the rings.&nbsp; They are extremely difficult to form and I strongly advise keeping them intact if you dismantle the set later because they are so difficult.&nbsp; If you are getting this set for your child, they will probably need help with the rings, though they should be able to manage the rest of the set, as it is not difficult.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is a nice addition to any Hogwarts Castle set up.&nbsp; The stand is well-designed and fits one minifigure.&nbsp; Each of the rings are at different levels, but I think it could have been made so there was more disparity, however if you have extra bricks lying around, it is an easy fix.&nbsp; My only real complaint here is the trophy.&nbsp; It looks nice enough from a design perspective, but it is too large in comparison to the minifigures.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I strongly recommend this for any Harry Potter fan.&nbsp; Obviously if you want to make a whole Quidditch pitch, you will need more than this set, but it makes a nice addition to a Hogwarts Castle.&nbsp; Also, it comes with 5 excellent minifigures that are must-haves for any LEGO Harry Potter collector.&nbsp; I think kids will love the catapults for launching the bludgers.<br></p><p>There are some inaccuracies in this set (for example, on the box Wood and Flint are shown using beaters bats, but Wood is supposed to be a keeper and Flint is supposed to be a chaser), but I am willing to overlook them as a proper set would have required two sets of rings and two entire Quidditch teams, which would have sent the price of this set through the roof.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,4

There're lot's of changes from the 2002 and the 2010 verison. First the minifigs changed. Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy and Madam Hooch are remakes of the 4726 set and this set also includes two new characters: Oliver Wood and Marcus Flint. If you have a close look at Oliver Wood's face you'll notice that he looks like Mutt Williams from the Indiana Jones theme. We also get some cool stuff like 3 goals which are remade. The rings are now made of rubber and a little bit harder to put on than the ones from 2002. We also got a treasure chest with 3 different balls. The other stuff we get are two catapults, a podium with a trophy and the Ravenclaw tower. It's a really nice set and I really can't complain about it.<br><br>All

<p>I got this set (in fact, two of these sets) when I was only ten years old, and at the time it seemed perfect. As a huge fan of Harry Potter, the mere inclusion of quidditch was enough for the set to garner my love. The set, however, becomes less impressive in retrospect, especially with the truly enormous markup it now carries. It is still fairly good, but perhaps not as great as I thought 7 years ago. Let&#39;s take a look.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>Unusually for a Harry Potter set, the parts are fairly basic.The only unique non-minifigure parts are the golden hoops. The tower is constructed of relatively basic slopes and bricks, while the hoops are made of more interesting, but not too uncommon, dark red bricks. The trophy piece appears frequently in the world racers sets, but is still nice to see here if you do not collect that line. The broomsticks are very nice, with five being included. The parts selection overall, however, is very average.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>The minifigures are by far the biggest selling point of this set. All five of them are unique, among those three are unique characters. The quidditch uniforms are major upgrades from their last appearances, both in accuracy and detail, and Madame Hooch is excellent as well, although I&#39;m not sure why her eyes are orange on the reverse of her head. Oliver wood has the exact same head and hair as Mutt Williams, but as the head is fairly generic in the first place, it works well for Wood. The hair suits Wood far better than it ever did Williams.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The build is basic, with the only interesting technique being found in the hoops. It all comes together nicely enough, but when it&#39;s all finished, it&#39;s somewhat disappointing. There is only one tower, and three hoops, not enough to have any sort of real quidditch game. I think the set would have been much better had it included two towers and sets of hoops. I recieved a second set, and it looks much more complete this way.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>It is a nice set, and a major improvement over the last quidditch set from 2002. However, it is simply incomplete, and at the current market price of ~$40, it&#39;s not really feasible to buy two. At the original price, it&#39;s a good set with problems. At the current price, I&#39;d recommend just getting the minifigures and making your own, probably better, quidditch pitch.</p>

"meme100","2013-01-08T14:13:47.917Z","An OK set","<h4>SUMMARY</h4><p>The set has good detail and minifigures. But the value for money I don't think is that good</p><h4>MINIFIGURES</h4><h4>&nbsp;HARRY POTTER</h4><p>Harry in his Quidiitich robes is an amazing minifig. He has the same hair as he has since 2001 but the new face gives him extra expression. Wich is good if your playing Quidditch. he has the amazing detail on his torso. He has a Brown broom wich is his Nimbus 2000. [Hogwarts Castle you get his Firebolt]</p><h4>OLIVER WOOD</h4><p>Oliver is an exclusive to this set with the same Quidditch robes. His face is also very well done and they've used hair that lego have used for ages.</p><h4>DRACO MALFOY</h4><p>Draco has new hair with a new smirkish face. But when he's not doing so well on the pitch he has a worried face. Torso is the same as Harry's and Oliver's but just dark green. He has his black broom representing his Nimbus 2001</p><h4>MARCUS FLINT</h4><p>Marcus's face makes him look like an ugly troll. His torso is the same as Malfoy and the broom. He also has the same hair as Oliver&nbsp;but just black.&nbsp;</p><h4>BUILD</h4><p>The build is easy so if your new to lego this is a set that could be a starter.</p><h4>&nbsp;</h4>",TRUE,3,1,2,2,2
"HarleyMeenen","2016-08-23T23:57:00.753Z","A Nice Quick Addition to Other Sets","<p>The Quidditch set includes Madam Hooch, Oliver Wood, Marcus Flint, Draco with two expressions, and Harry with two expressions. It also includes the Quidditch cup, brooms, and the balls, though the Snitch is actually just a gold stud. The major building is a stand in Ravenclaw colors, and other pieces are a trophy stand, hoops, and catapults.</p>

<p>This set is a pretty small one, and can be done quite quickly. For that reason, I wouldn&#39;t really recommend it as a first choice if the goal is a significant time investment. It also doesn&#39;t have a lot of playability, as all that can really be done is use the catapult to either score goals or hit players with the Bludgers.</p>

<p>That being said, it&#39;s a good looking set and a nice feature to add to other Harry Potter sets. If you&#39;re looking to add some detail to Hogwarts or bring a little more life into a scene, it&#39;s nice. It&#39;s a decent set for the money and I&#39;m glad I have it.</p>
