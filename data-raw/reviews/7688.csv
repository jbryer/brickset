"David1971","2010-11-12T17:10:52.223Z","A very lovely set, with many superb details","<p>I mostly get Lego Star Wars sets these days, and have not been especially bothered about Harry Potter, but I was very happy to get and build this.&nbsp;It is an&nbsp;EXCELLENT set.</p>
<p>The minifigs are all really nice, and Hagrid's home is very nicely done indeed. The whole set is very pleasing and satisfying.</p>
<p>(I say 'the whole set' but actually I didn't even bother building the big spider.&nbsp;This probably has significance to Harry Potter fans but just seemed a bit daft to me).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main thing is Hagrid's hut. I don't agree with the review by '<SPAN class=""reviewer vcard""><SPAN class=fn>benjadude11' </SPAN></SPAN>which complains about some of the details ... you could hardly say that the designers have been careless about the detail here. (The&nbsp;big red button you're meant to add on to the back of the fireplace lightbrick&nbsp;is certainly odd, but leaving it off is, of course, extremely easy). </p>
<p>The interior of the hut has numerous details and neat touches. These are described in the longer reviews here, so I won't repeat much, but the lighting-up fireplace is lovely; the homely details, such as table with bowl and cup, very nice; and the gentle steps up and down from the front door are just one example of the many fine details which make it very realistic as a home that could be lived in. There are a few stickers for the mossy-brick effect on the sides, but these work well and so for once I didn't mind them. To compensate, the handsome owls are very nicely printed-on. Lego Toadstools are also a lovely feature.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a beautiful set, all very nice. And good value ...&nbsp;quite a lot&nbsp;more for your money than you'd get in a Star Wars set anyway, I think. Highly recommended.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"benjadude11","2010-11-05T18:38:40.33Z","Lack of attention to detail detracts from an otherwise spectacular set.","I got this at Toys 'R' Us for 5 dollars off, which does nothing to the price but eradicate the generous markup TRU takes. So it cost me $40. My plan was to use it as a grounds-hut for the Dracula's Castle MOC diorama I am working on, which basically is going to work, with a few tweaks here and there to make it more evil. But I digress.<div><br></div><div>I am going to be extremely cute and annoying in this review, partly because I was expecting the set to be perfect, partly because I feel that the sheer lack of attention to detail needs to be addressed. I am going to call attention to these few details, then review the rest of the set, which was very good.</div><div><br></div><div>First off, there is a four-by-four hole in the top of the roof. this should be easily avoidable, but as is it's presence detracts from the overall crispness of the set. Second, Hagrid's umbrella is awful. It took me staring at it for ten minutes to figure out what the heck it was, and when I did I threw it in a random box full of pieces because it's unnecessary and looks bad. Then there is the red rod sticking out of the side of the house. Why? it's supposed to be pressed, which activates the light up brick, but unless you're blind you can see the button perfectly well without it. And now we have Eragog, who's legs cannot simultaneously touch the ground, and who just looks kinda bad and cartoony in general. The hump on his back is way too big. This is the only thing that was better in the old set. The last thing I'm going to gripe about is so picky and kind of stupid I feel ashamed even mentioning it, but if you look at the green part of the roof there is a brown ring of smooth pieces that goes around the top and serves the purpose of absolutely nothing. They don't go all the way around, and their original purpose, of streamlining the roof, is ruined by the fact that there are 8 studs left uncovered, ones that easily could have been covered by using 1x8's instead of 1x6's. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Whew. I needed to get that out of my system.</div><div><br></div><div>On the bright side, everything not mentioned above is really good. The Harry, Ron, and Hermione figs are great, they are very expressive, and the happy side of the cranium has this expression that's compelling. They got swagger.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The light up brick is excellent. It is really great. It makes you feel like you are on a movie set. It adds warmth, it makes the hut inviting, something that is very hard to do with just plain bricks. I also love the chimney.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The inside of the house is superb. It's got a cauldron, potions, a hidden gem and letter (why? It doesn't matter) an axe, a fish, a key, meat, and a very intriguing sticker that seems to be a picture of Hagrid as a young wizard, enchanting something with his then-intact wand. So two thumbs up there.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, the set is good. Not as spectacular as I had been hoping, but still very good.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Afterthought: Why has there never been a Fang featured in a Hagrid's hut set? They have Norbert, and even owls, but no Fang. Too bad.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,3

"buzzandwoody2000","2011-06-06T18:03:30.02Z","Great set!","<p>Okay. I got this set at my local Target store on sale for $35. It was a good deal, so I bought it. I was pleased with what I got, but the only bad thing was the price. Even though it's a four-hundred peice set, it needs to be cheaper! Around 25-30 dollars is a nice price, because LEGO will make more money because more people will buy it! I'll start off with our minifigs, starting with Harry.</p>
<h4>Harry Potter</h4>
<p>Harry is my favorite character, but we need some other guys too! You know, I don't really have to go into deatil here. We all know what he looks like!</p>
<h4>Ron Weasley</h4>
<p>The cheapest way&nbsp;to get him! I was dissipointed he only comes in 3 sets in the whole theme. I like his exclusive hair, which is only used in the Soccer Player MInifig. He has the normal Gryffindor torso and his happy, pleased face and his scared face.</p>
<h4>Hermione Granger</h4>
<p>Hermione is a nice minifig, and this is also the cheapest way to get her. She has Marion Ravenwood style lego hair, only brown. It looks pretty acurate to Emma Watson, which is a plus. (If you don't know who Emma Watson is, she plays Hermione in the Harry Potter movies.)</p>
<h4>Rubeus Hagrid</h4>
<p>Hagrid is a really huge minifig! I like the detail that went into his coat, and his beard is a nice touch. Nice minifig!</p>
<h4>Aragog</h4>
<p>Well, a nice spider. He's pretty decent, but very small. He has a nice printed eye peice and but still needs to be bigger.</p>
<h4>The Hut</h4>
<p>Well, I really like this. It is a nice touch to have Norbert in the caulderon and the light brick fireplace. The table with the plate goes nice, as well as the amazing (finally!) back&nbsp; door and window. I enjoyed building it! It was a fun build. On the outside, the roof is well built and the steps to the door are a nice touch! I like the chimney on it.</p>

"pod120","2010-12-16T07:57:13.477Z","""Well he's gotta have a name, dun he?""","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of six new&nbsp;2010 HP&nbsp;sets, a line which many people thought had finished. Personally, I think that the new sets have a greater extent of detail and attention to the books and films. All the minifigs have been completely redesigned. Obviously, LEGO have based these sets on multiple books/films in the series, as well as earlier LEGO set locations and events. The location of Hagrid's Hut has had two previous LEGO set incarnations, one in 2001 and one in 2004. <em>Aragog </em>has been included before in a HP set in 2002. I got this set for 20% off along with four of the other 2010 HP sets when these sets were first officially released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Harry Potter</em></strong> appears in all six of the new sets, which is starting to get annoying. He has a double-sided head. One side is a smile and the other is a frown. Some people complain about him having his original hairpiece. This doesn't really bother me, but I see how it can be a negative. No one really gets excited about this minifig, because he is in all of the new sets. Something that I did find unusual about him was that this is the first incarnation of Hagrid's Hut to include a <em>Harry Potter</em> minifig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Ron Weasley </em></strong>wears the same generic Gryffindor uniform as Harry. I like how LEGO have given the uniform black legs, rather than have the torso and legs the same grey colour.&nbsp;His head is double-sided.&nbsp;One side is&nbsp;a grin and the other looks like a scared or surprised expression. It's good to see that LEGO finally changed his hair. I wouldn't say that it is perfect, but it is alright. Like Harry, opinions&nbsp;about&nbsp;his hair&nbsp;will differ. Also like Harry, he has not been seen in an incarnation of this set before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Hermione Granger </em></strong>also wears the same Gryffindor uniform and has a double-sided head. One side is a smile and the other side is a frown. I wouldn't say that the face is the most accurate I have ever seen for a LEGO minifig, but it would certainly pass. As for the hair, you can have your own opinion, because I don't really have one. This is the only 2010 HP set that includes <em>Harry</em>, <em>Ron</em> and <em>Hermione</em> all<em>&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;one set. It is also the first incarnation of Hagrid's Hut that includes more than two minifigs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Rubeus Hagrid</em></strong> has been seen a few times in LEGO before. I think his appearance in this set is his greatest progression from his previous design. Of the 2010 HP sets, this is the only set that he is included. The printings on his clothes and face are remarkable. He still uses the original body and hair pieces. This does not&nbsp;bother me in the slightest, but it will for some people. Especially when considering that his legs are not positionable. The hands are nicely detailed, but feel quite loose when positioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Creatures</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>spider (3)</p>
<p>grey owl</p>
<p>brown owl</p>
<p>fish</p>
<p>rat [<em>Scabbers</em>]</p>
<p>baby dragon [<em>Norbert</em>]</p>
<p>acromantula<em> </em>[<em>Aragog</em>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the size of the set, the range and amount of animals is great. There is a combination of creatures which are included in many of the new HP sets and creatures which are more unique to this set. The new owls are great and I am pleased that LEGO have finally given them printing. I did not expect them to be this detailed.&nbsp;Two of three new designs are included. The owls in this set&nbsp;do not appear to represent any character. I am unsure whether the spiders are normal spiders or small acromantulas. Either way, they are a good addition to the set and it's nice that&nbsp;you get three. Many people would not class the fish as a creature, but I do.&nbsp;Although it is&nbsp;a recent piece, it has been used many times since its debut.&nbsp;The back of the box art implies that the rat is <em>Scabbers</em>, however there are no unique features about this specific rat. I think the piece may be new though, as the tail is shorter than rats seen previously in LEGO. I don't know what most people think of <em>Norbert</em> as a piece, not being able to move his wings or anything. I was extremely satisfied with the set once I saw <em>Norbert</em> was included. This was the first indication to me that LEGO had based these sets on multiple movies in the HP series. The piece itself is of&nbsp;a reasonably complex mould. It's up to you whether you prefer a more sandy or dark green. As <em>Aragog</em> is a large, built component of the set, I will expain more about him later in the review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>brown wand (3)</p>
<p>key (2)</p>
<p>pink umbrella</p>
<p>crossbow</p>
<p>large lantern</p>
<p>black broomstick</p>
<p>axe</p>
<p>chicken leg</p>
<p>pot plant</p>
<p>letter</p>
<p>red gem</p>
<p>cauldron</p>
<p>yellow plate</p>
<p>clear mug</p>
<p>red potion</p>
<p>green potion</p>
<p>blue potion</p>
<p>barrel</p>
<p>pumpkin [carrot stalk]</p>
<p>pumpkin [triple leaves]</p>
<p>pumpkin [no stalk]</p>
<p>mushroom [studs]</p>
<p>mushroom [cone brick]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a reasonable amount of accessories for the size of the set. I am not going to explain in great detail about all of them. I would probably not consider all of them accessories, such as the barrel, pumpkins and mushrooms. However, if removed from the base, they could be used as accessories. The printings on the mushrooms and pumpkins&nbsp;are nice details. It almost seems lazy of LEGO to use halloween pumpkin heads, but who is going to complain?&nbsp;Some of the accessories are additions that would have been unlikely to be included in the first or second incarnation of the set. These may include the plate, mug, umbrella, chicken leg&nbsp;and crossbow. It's nice to see that these things are included.&nbsp;Once again, the wands are&nbsp;an interference in some ways and it is unfortunate that they are not shorter or repalced with a more unique piece. Some things like the keys, letter and potions have been seen before, but are nice additions. Other things, like the gem, barrel and axe are accessories which people appreciate for reasons of shape and colour. The gem, being the only one in the set and being red in colour, suggests it is the Philosopher's Stone. It's up to you&nbsp;how you use&nbsp;the gem. Like <em>4736</em> <em>Freeing Dobby</em>, the broomstick is a harmless addition to the set. This is the only 2010 HP set that includes a cauldron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The hut</strong> shows amazing detail, especially its interior. The first and second incarnation of this set looked like LEGO sets, whereas this incarnation looks more like a model. The hut uses hinges to open. The hut&nbsp;is based on on a square format, which is similar to the second incarnation. The first incarnation was a single wall which formed an octagonal hut. Although the first inacrnation captured a more correct shape, this format seems to just work better when it opens. If opened the entire way, the hut can be used as a hut with two rooms, as it&nbsp;appears&nbsp;in the third HP film onwards. The seat and table are two pieces of furniture which would have been unlikely to appear in previous incarnation in the detail they have this time. Other details which I would consider progress&nbsp;are the hanging things from the ceiling, the steps to the doorway and the use of gold lattice windows. Perhaps, even the portrait on the wall.&nbsp;Many of the other sets use black lattice windows, so it's nice to have something different here. The new doors look and work quite well.&nbsp;The cauldron can be connected to an arm and be swivelled in or out of the fireplace. The top of the&nbsp;seat can be removed to reveal what is underneath. The exterior is quite detailed as well. The only negatives are that stickers are a main source of detail and that the hut has a sort of square appearance. The roof is good, even though it only consists of four panels. Where the four panels meet there is a hole. Althought I thought it would, it does not bother me, but it is sort of unrealistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Aragog</em></strong> has positionable legs which are constructed from samurai swords. Two of the pieces used to construct him are printed bricks. I do find it unfortunate that LEGO cannot print bricks, rather than using stickers, as I am sure many people would prefer it. The printed bricks add good detail. There is some argument as to which is the best <em>Aragog</em> out of this one and the one seen in 2002. If I was asked, I would say this one. Although it doesn't capture the shape of a spider as well as before, it does have good detail and perhaps a better choice of pieces.&nbsp;<em>Aragog's</em> inclusion in the set gives the sense that this third incarnation is larger that the previous two and is more than just a hut. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The light-up brick</strong> is not really an individual&nbsp;component, but it thought that it was best to talk about it on its own. I seems to work without any problems and has a good yellow colour to represent fire. Unfortunately, I feel that its power will run out one day and that&nbsp;it isn't&nbsp;really replaceable. A good thing about it is that it can easily be detached. Although this is a good addition to the set, it didn't really stand out to me as a big positive or negative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Which Movie?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hagrid's Hut appears in just about every HP movie. Therefore, this set could be based on just about any movie in the series. <em>Norbert</em> only appears in the first film, which does not have <em>Aragog</em> at all. <em>Aragog's</em> most important role was in the second film. He also reappeared in the sixth. A pumpkin patch did not appear at Hagrid's Hut until the third film, the same for there being two doors. I think LEGO tried to show the best image of the Hut, over the course of many movies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hut shows detail far beyond what was seen in the first and second incarnations of this set. I felt that the building experience was one of the most complex among the 2010 HP sets, especially when constructing two walls simultaneously. For the size of the set, the variety of pieces is fantastic, and the main reason that I bought this set. As a hut, it does alright for playability, but it is minimal. It is like it is meant to be more of a model. You can put the minifigs inside or outside, there no where else to go. This isn't really a problem, it's just how the set is. The value for money isn't great when you consider the amount of pieces, but you do get so much in the set that the cost is not something to complain about. The two main positives of this set for me are the broad range of creatures and accessories and the amount of detail the set has. The two&nbsp;main negatives for me&nbsp;are the inclusion of stickers and that the set dropped short on playability. I'm surprised that <em>Hagrid's</em> Dog was absent this time around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest this set to anyone with <em>4842 Hogwarts Castle.</em> I would not really suggest the set to someone with any of the other 2010 HP sets, unless you want this one for its pieces or wish to get all the sets. The set is a good stand alone set if you are only going to get one set. This is because it includes<em> Harry, Ron </em>and<em> Hermione</em> and common items and animals seen in the HP universe. It is also a good starter set for those same reasons. All of the 2010 HP sets will most likely include a piece you don't already own.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,4

This is the first time I have the whole trio, and my first Hagrid, so let's go...<div><br></div><h4>Minifigures:</h4><div><br></div><div>Rubeus Hagrid: Hagrid is a cool minifigure. His whole body is one piece, it's pretty big. It's like a brown coat with a lighter brown shirt and a brown belt beneath. He has normal arms, but his hands have the fingers molded in too so you get more realistic hands. His beard and hair is all one black piece, and its big and neat, but flimsy if you take it off. Without his beard, he is kind of weird. He has a basic smile, hairy eyebrows, and some big friendly eyes, but these lines on his face make it so you need the beard. Hagrid is a little smaller than I would of liked. Without his hair, he's like half a head taller than a normal minifigure. With his hair, however, he's a head taller than the normal minifigure, so a good size. He's not big enough but as close as Lego can get without making him freakishly large. Hagrid comes with his crossbow which is rare and new to me. He also gets his pink umbrella, which is closed, and a heavy lantern.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ron Weasley: I like this minifigure. He has normal black legs and Gryffindor robes, with his red tie and Gryffindor shield on the front and some wrinkles in his shirt on the back. Very realistic. His hair is a surfer cut, wavy and a great orange color (though the Weasleys are red-heads) and looks great on Ron, while his half-smile face looks slightly old with one wrinkle. On the back there a scared face which shows his teeth, almost like he is shivering. He's a great minifigure and goes well with the set. He comes with a brown wand. He is my favorite minifigure for some reason.</div><div><br></div><div>Hermione Granger: Hermione is a great minifigure. Her clothing is the same as Ron's, black legs, Gryffindor uniform. Her head is a smile, with brown lipstick.H On the other side of her head is a frown, like Harry is copying Ron's homework again. Her eyebrows are pointed down and I just really like that face. Her hair....it looks to feminine, like a princess, and Hermione is a tomboy! I don't know about it...It looks good with Hermione but not the best choice. She comes with a brown wand.</div><div><br></div><div>Harry Potter: He also has the same outfit as Ron and Hermione. He has a smile on one face, and a frown on the other, like Malfoy just insulted him or he's in battle with Voldemort. He has messy black hair. I love the red scar on his face. He also comes with a brown wand. I know, not much to say, but Harry is Harry, we all know what he is and I've already described his outfit.</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, so now I'll do some of the small things.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Small Things</h4><div><br></div><div>You get a couple nice mushrooms. They're red with white spots, and the spots were printed! Very attractive and possibly new. I just love them. You also get some studs to represent small mushrooms that haven't grown entirely. Then there are a few orange pumpkins. One has a small, stiff plant/stem on it, while another has these big, flexible leaves growing, and one is just bare. Now here is one a cool thing - the pumpkins are actually heads. On one side are these cackling faces, but you have to turn them to the orange side to make them pumpkins. That was a cool feature that I like, and I'm glad Lego included it. There are some orange studs, too. In the back there is a barrel and a couple wooden steps leading to a door. So those are some cool plants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There are also three small black spiders (shudder), which explains Ron's scared face. Then there is a small gray rat that I'm just leaving on the front of the house to rest and basically not do anything. But I like it and its my only rat. Inside you get Norbert. Small dragon but interesting.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Then Aragog. Aragog is awesome. You get eight, long legs which are actually swords, black swords to be exact. There's a small head and a tile to represent his face, which are six green eyes. They'e missing two eyes! But the legs make up for it. Also his face is not a sticker, it's printed. Nice! Then he has these silver fangs and in the back there's a big hairy, brown piece to represent his rear-end. It is also printed (yes!) and is a nice feature. I hate spiders, but I LOVE Aragog.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now for the star of the show....Hagrid's Hut.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Hut</h4><div><br></div><div>I'll&nbsp;separate&nbsp;this set into two sections, the inside and the roof. I'll begin with the inside.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Inside of Hagrid's Hut</b></div><div><br></div><div>The inside blows my mind.</div><div><br></div><div>You walk in and see a small table which is kind of in your way. There is a black broom propped up against the wall. The table has a yellow plate and a clear cup. Then there is a bench &nbsp;besides a small plant and a picture of a dead wizard, probably Hagrid's father. If you lift up the bench you see a box with a jewel and a Hogwarts letter. A black ax and a key hangs from the ceiling. Also, inside on the bench is a gray owl with wonderful printed designs, making it very realistic. There is a window above the bench with gold shutters that can be opened from the inside to let in some light. As you move in, to the second half, you find a unique piece.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, the second half has a fireplace. There is a black cauldron over it for cooking that swivels out. When you move the fireplace, there is some orange studs and pieces to represent fire. But when you push a small red piece outside, the fireplace lights up and shines a yellow light from beneath the cauldron, like fire, as if something is really cooking and boiling. It lights up the whole hut. Brilliant! Above the cauldron is a shelf with some potion bottles and spices. Hanging from the ceiling is a silver fish and a chicken leg, so I'm betting this is the kitchen. Then you walk up some wooden steps, pass a key, exit the old-fashioned and exceptional door, go down some more steps, and you're outside.</div><div><br></div><div>Time for the roof.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Roof of Hagrid's Hut</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>The roof has two subsections, the green base and then the steep gray...points? I don't know. But I love the green base, with a very attractive color, the good old Hogwarts color, and some interesting brick shapes. It all fits well to create a strong<b>&nbsp;</b>base. It just looks so...right. There is a brown owl which also has great printing that I love so much.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Then there are four parts that are basically identical triangular boards (except hey're made up of several pieces) that all make the point of the roof. It sort of looks like a pyramid, but the top is more of a square, it doesn't fit all the way. These roof parts can be moved and at the top you get a look inside his hut.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is also a chimney that has a couple stickers and a nice design.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, Hagrid's Hut is a great Lego set! Really worth it and I would&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;it to any Lego fan, especially Harry Potter and Castle lovers. It was made well and was a fun but challenging build. Also, the box is huge so I like it and the instruction manuals have those small boxes that tell you what you're going to need. There are numbered bags. So buy this set! It is awesome and worth the money.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you liked my review, look for my next on Hogwarts, which I hope to get real soon. &nbsp;Please get this set!&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"SuperChris","2011-01-07T07:53:37.147Z","Let's take a trip to Hagrid's Hut!","<h4>Introduction</h4><div>The 4th set I got from the latest line of Harry Potter sets was Hagrid's Hut. This is the 3rd version of the Hut. It costs Â£40 in the UK, which I think is a little bit overpriced. And you get 4 figures, which I'm down with. Lets have a look at the set, shall we?</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Like I said, you get 4 figures. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Hagrid. Hagrid is a lot more detailed than the past versions of him, and he looks a lot better for it. As for the others, these are great. Like every other set, we get a Harry, nothing special, but it's needed.&nbsp;The Ron figure is amazing, the hair piece is so right.&nbsp;Hagrid's Hut is also the only set that we get all 3 of the trio with so far from the 2010 sets (bar Diagon Alley, of course). <a href=""http://chrissramblings.com/2010/11/14/chamber-of-secrets-secrets/p1060667/"">You can see a picture of the trio looking swell here.</a>&nbsp;(click the photo to enlarge).</div><div><br></div><h4>The Set</h4><div>The Hut is really nice. It looks great, and unlike the 1st version, has a proper roof. To be fair, it's a little bit smaller than the 2nd, which is odd, seen as you're paying more. We get a light up brick. Not a huge selling point for me, but its a nice addiction, I'm sure it added a little bit more to the price though.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You get loads of nice pieces, and little things like chicken legs add a lot to the set, although, they are a little random. We also get 3 of those lovely printed owls, and a pink umbrella. Also, pumpkins! We get Aragog the spider, which looks dreadful. The first version is lot better, but still, better than nothing. An odd thing is that we don't get a Fang figure AGAIN. Come on Lego, one Fang figure. Please? <a href=""http://chrissramblings.com/2010/11/14/chamber-of-secrets-secrets/p1060664/"">Anyway, you can see a photograph of the full set here.&nbsp;</a></div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div>The build isn't a difficult one. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. And it all comes together into one nice building at the end. I timed it and it took just under 1 hour, which isn't too long for a Â£40 set.</div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>Should you buy this set? Well, it's a great way to get all 3 of the trio in Uniform and Hagrid. It's also a good way to get a light up brick, if you want one of them. I guess it's good for pieces as well for your MOCs. On the other hand, it's a bit expensive for what it is. Â£40 is a bit too much, I think Â£30 is more reasonable. Also, if you have the 2nd version of Hagrid's Hut, maybe give this set a miss. They are very similar. If you find it cheap, buy it for sure, you won't regret it!</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading, <a href=""http://chrissramblings.com/2010/11/14/chamber-of-secrets-secrets/"">and be sure to check out more information about this set on my blog</a>.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,3

<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>This, is, if I remember, the 3rd version of Hagrid's Hut. And, to put it simply, it was one bloody brilliant set!</div>
</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<div>
<ul>
    <li>Great, redesigned Hagrid has more detailed body printing. Unlike the original versions, he has printing on the coat part. He also has his umbrella broom, which has 2 nice pink pieces, and his face is set up much better than the original, which was just ugly.</li>
    <li>Much easier way of getting a Ron minifigure. His scared face is priceless.</li>
    <li>Light bricks are always great!! If you press it a certain way, the fire will appear to flicker like in real life.</li>
    <li>Nice, detailed inside. Fireplace, swinging pot feature, shelf above fireplace with potions and what not, steps coming from the front door, little plant, and a table-like piece of furniture, whose top lifts off and reveals what seems to be the Sorcerer's Stone.</li>
    <li>A different colored Norbert, the baby dragon, as seen in the first book/movie.</li>
    <li>2 more owls. :)</li>
    <li>Aragog is very cool. I thought it was neat that they used the samuai swords for the legs. I found it to be effective. His abdomen and face piece were both printed (Yesssss!!). I had 2 problems with the spider though...</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
    <li>Aragog's face was simply ridicolous, but, it wasn't a sticker, so, it makes it less worse.</li>
    <li>Aragog had silver fangs. I don' get that. :/</li>
</ul>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<h4>Overall:</h4>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Fantastic set, and I recommend you buy it, as a model or to recreate the scenes from the film and book that took place in Hagrid's not-so-horrible hut!!</div>

&nbsp;</div>

"wander099","2011-04-17T08:48:03.49Z","Movie Accurate","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box shows a big picture of the hut and spiders.&nbsp; Even from this picture, you can see how poorly the big spider (Aragog) is designed.&nbsp; On the back you've got a view of the inside of the hut as well as all the major features.&nbsp; It comes with a single instruction booklet.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some great parts in this set.&nbsp; The pumpkins outside the hut have faces on the other side, so you could use them for a Halloween MOC or stick them on minifigures if you want.&nbsp; Also outside the hut are the mushrooms, the tops of which are red with white spots, and they look really nice.&nbsp; You get two of the new printed owls and Norbert the dragon!&nbsp; Inside you also get a cooking pot, a large plastic dish, a fish, a chicken drumstick, an axe with the new style of blade (it looks aged and more like metal than previous axes), Scabbers the rat, a little envelope tile, and of course the light brick.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Harry:</p><p>This is the new version of Harry and he can be found in three sets, including this one.&nbsp; He is wearing his school uniform so he has his grey shirt with the Gryffindor emblem and tie in gold and red.&nbsp; There is also a red and gold line at the hem of his shirt.&nbsp; His torso is double printed and looks great.&nbsp; He comes with a brown wand and his head is double-sided.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ron:</p><p>You get the new version of Ron as well.&nbsp; His hair is much nicer looking and accurately portrays his hair in the later movies.&nbsp; He has the same torso and legs as Harry, the same brown wand, and a double-sided head.&nbsp; What is notable about this figure is that it is exclusive to this set.&nbsp; There are no other sets with this version of Ron yet. So if you want the redesigned trio, you will have to buy Hagrid's Hut.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hermione:</p><p>This is also a new version and is largely the same as Harry and Ron: same torso, same legs, same brown wand, and a double-sided head.&nbsp; However, she appears in two sets: Hagrid's Hut and Hogwarts Castle.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hagrid:</p><p>This is the best figure in the set.&nbsp; Hagrid is completely redesigned with much greater detail.&nbsp; I don't like the feel of his plastic hair piece (it seems flimsy), but it does look nice on the figure.&nbsp; His body and feet are one large plastic piece which is printed on the front.&nbsp; You can actually see the fingers on his hands!&nbsp; He comes with a lantern and his pink umbrella (both of which you have to build), as well as a crossbow.&nbsp; This new version is only available in this set and in the Diagon Alley one which is significantly larger and more expensive.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is a fun one.&nbsp; It is not too easy or too difficult, and it is not repetitive.&nbsp; There are some stickers, and as always I find them to be annoying.&nbsp; In this case they were largely for the large bits on the walls, but they were still annoying to place.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This model is excellent with the exception of Aragog.&nbsp; I had hoped that with all these improved Harry Potter sets that Lego would have made an improvement on Aragog's design, but alas it is no better (it might actually be worse!).&nbsp; While he has printed pieces (no stickers), his face looks ridiculous and for some reason his fangs are silver when they should have been black.&nbsp; The only plus is that his legs use 8 katanas, so if you don't want to build him you can make use of those.</p><p>The hut itself is very well designed and includes excellent accessories (Norbert, Scabbers, the pink umbrella, etc.) such that you can act out most, if not all, of the scenes from the movies involving this setting (so long as you have the minifigures).&nbsp; It can be kept closed as a display piece or opened up with the hinges for play.&nbsp; You get the best of both worlds in this set-playability and display ability.&nbsp; The cooking pot can be swung in and out of the fire place and the light brick makes it look like there is a little fire in there.&nbsp; Although for some reason you get a little jewel which I think is supposed to be the philosopher's stone, and this doesn't make sense because the stone was never in Hagrid's Hut...<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a great set.&nbsp; I'm not sure how it compares to previous versions of Hagrid's Hut because this is my first set of it, but it is movie accurate (with the exception of the philosopher's stone).&nbsp; I recommend this to all fans of Harry Potter because it makes both a nice display piece and a fun set to play with.&nbsp; If you don't have a Hagrid's Hut yet, I definitely recommend buying this set.&nbsp; With the minifigures and the great design, it was worth the $55 CDN I paid for it.&nbsp; Remember, you don't have to use Aragog (or you can try to design one yourself with the pieces from this set and the pieces in your collection).<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box is about 30cm wide at the front and back and about 10cm wide at the sides. The height is about 20cm. The instructions are quite easy. 9.5/10</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The parts are&nbsp;generally found in other sets.&nbsp;9/10</div>
<h4>Minifigures&nbsp;</h4><div>The minifigures included are Hagrid (Obviously), Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. Quite common people in the Harry Potter theme. Harry has a happy face and an angry one. Hermione has a happy face and a confused/angry one. Ron has a chilled/relaxed/happy face and a scared one. Hagrid has a happy face. Harry, Ron and Hermione have Gryffindor uniforms and black legs and a brown wand each. Hagrid has a unique to him body and a pink umbrella.9.9/10&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>It took me about 10 minutes to build the hut, 2 minutes for Aragog and 55 seconds for the minifigures. Quite easy and fun to build. 9.7/10</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>Fun to play with. You could use the hut in many ways. For example you could use it as Hagrid's hut or as a peasant's hut. 9/10</div>

I will say that even at the listed price of $40, this set is well worth it if I had bought myself.<br><br>I am writing this as a parent instead of as an AFOL who got this to add to their collection because I have money, job and this is my hobby with collecting LEGO. Mainly as I have a daughter who loves to play with these sets too and this is an area where we bond and interact together.<br><br>The build with this set was fairly simple and straight forward to make and there's lot of details and accessories with this set for making Hagrid's Hut. Someone like my daughter would have found it too advanced for her due to her age. The final build of the hut is something though, that gets her interest. And if memory serves right, there has been at least one other version of Hagrid's Hut that I've seen, but the roof was completed using flimsy cardboard and not actual LEGO pieces. Color wise, this set is far better visually then any of the previous huts I've seen.<br><br>Aragog I enjoyed putting together and found it clever the use of katana swords for making his spindly legs. My daughter was greatly amused, asking me questions about the set, who the characters were and wanting me to explain the story and then having us play, acting out the scenes from the movies. (At four, nearly five, the Harry Potter movies are not quiet yet age appropriate for her and soon I will be planning to start trying to read some of the first couple books to her).<br><br>I love the minifigures, they're very well done of Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Harry. The inclusion of a little rat piece means you've got Scabbers, so any era of Harry Potter books/scenes before Prisoner of Azkaban can be played out. Same with the inclusion of Aragog and his little spider children included, there's a couple scenes for Chamber of Secrets that can be played out too.<br><br>I can easily see any child, even mine being amused for hours with all the details, elements and scenarios that can be played out. This set is a welcomed addition to my collection and with being nearly finished with the Atlantis theme, I'm turning my attention to some of the other themes that I'd like to get more sets of.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Faefrost","2016-12-21T07:31:18.7Z","One of the best of the HP line that flex's into many others displays","<p>Hagrid&#39;s Hut remains one of the most amazingly useful cross theme sets ever released by Lego. It is a fantastic full and complete building. 4 walls, roof and door, with a dollhouse style access mechanism. The interior is nicely detailed complete with light brick in the fireplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs -&nbsp;</strong>The full primary HP cast with Harry, Ron Hermione and Hagrid. We also get a brick built Aragog the Spider and a baby Norbert. And 2 owls.</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>Lots of rare parts that still hold up today. Lots of sand green, textured brick bricks, Norbery. Printed Pumpkin heads, a light brick, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Model/Build -&nbsp;</strong>The build is fantastic. It feels complete. It locks solidly closed, and opens easy. It slits on the diagonal, which involves some really neat builds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arogog is fascinating as his legs are made from Ninja swords in black.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Uses -&nbsp;</strong>This is one of the most flexible and useful structures we have ever gotten. Aside from its obvious HP use, it works wonderfully as a small farm in Castle, or a nice Witches Hut. It fits well in a Ninjago or Middle Earth display. Just by changing the figs you can change the setting with no alteration to the main build. This spent many years in my Fantasy Era Castle display as a Witches Hut, moved on to part of the Winter Village And is currently residing on the Isle of Ninjago.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall -&nbsp;</strong>Fantastic. I would categorize this one as the single best set in the HP line, simply for how useful it is. It is one set that never goes off display for me. Always finding a new tenant and setting.&nbsp;</p>

Apart from those two minor issues, I highly recommend this set, as it is fun, interesting, and looks great.</p>
