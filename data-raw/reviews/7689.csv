"Yope","2010-09-15T11:34:42.807Z","Magnificent!","<p>Howdy! First and foremost, I love this set. The intricate details, the character of the building and most definitely the minifigures.&nbsp;Lego has done a great job of encaptulating the warmth of the burrow&nbsp;and Bellatrix Lestrange has to be one of the best minifigures ever! My only disappointment here in the UK was the price. When I saw that it was $59.99 in America I (rather sadly) used a currency converter to find that $59.99 was approximately £40, an excellent price! However when the set was priced in the UK it was £59.99, gutted! So, for all of you who like the look of this set, I would wait and see whether you could get it cheaper from America. I think that's all, hope I was helpful and thanks for reading! ...or something.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"cs38135","2010-09-24T22:15:15.56Z","A wonderful set!","I have been a fan of Harry Potter for a long time, but I (unfortunately) haven't really been interested in HP Lego until now. I pre-ordered Freeing Dobby and The Burrow, and they came pretty quickly (today)!<div><br></div><div>Minifigures (6)</div><div>Pros: -Four never-portrayed-before figures (all but Harry and Ginny).</div><div>-Four have double-sided heads (all but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley). Bellatrix has scared and, well, evil looks, Fenrir has bared teeth and a closed mouth. Harry has a happy and angry face, as does Ginny.</div><div>-Great hairpieces and torso designs for all characters! Bellatrix's hair has to be the best, followed by Ginny's or Mrs. Weasley's. Also, for the most part, the faces fit pretty well.</div><div>-Accessories: 5 wands (2 black, 1 brown, 1 gray, 1 tan). I suppose Mrs. Weasley doesn't need one if she's in the kitchen preparing the next meal, but how is she going to duel Bellatrix without one? There also is a black broomstick, which is a nice inclusion.</div><div>-The animals (though not truly minifigures): There is one frog, and a pig with printed eyes, who gets to sit between two stickered doors in a grassy area outside the kitchen. Also, don't forget the owls! They are both printed with great designs. One is white (Hedwig) and one is gray (Errol or Hermes?)</div><div><br></div><div>Cons: Only one Weasley child.</div><div>I'd say 6 figures is a fair amount for a sixty dollar set. $10/figure is good for higher-priced sets, in my opinion. However, it wouldn't have hurt to include a Weasley brother, especially Ron, in this set. There isn't even a Ron in the new Hogwarts Castle, either!</div><div><br></div><div>Parts</div><div>Pros: Fire, flowerpots, 2 red cups, 4 goblets, many gold studs, socks, dishes, knives (in the drawers in the kitchen), a croissant (in the oven), a barrel for wand storage, a front door (have to have that), a trunk, a kitchen table good for six, two swiveling chairs, a swamp with water and reeds, nine openable windows, the fireplace, three beds with orange and blue covers, and two catapults. Finally, I want to mention that there are two printed newspapers, a copy of the Quibbler featuring Harry's interview, and a copy of the Daily Prophet informing of a mass breakout from Azkaban.</div><div>Cons: Stickers! You have to use stickers to make the clock, stove, ""floo"" flame, quidditch posters, and many wooden boards. There is a quidditch sticker in the top bedroom, and a Chudley Cannons sticker in the middle bedroom.</div><div><br></div><div>Building</div><div>The build isn't too difficult. There are two instruction booklets, a page of stickers, and four labeled bags. The first bag covers the figures, fireplace, and swamp. The second; the bottom level.&nbsp;</div><div>The third covers the gap between the first and second floors. Here, there is a chandelier for the kitchen, and a small window (above the front door) that allows light into the kitchen below it. There is a 4x2 area there, but only really big enough for extra pieces. Finally, the fourth covers the bedrooms.</div><div>The build gets more interesting the longer you work. The Burrow has a great, asymmetrical exterior. The tip of the tallest chimney reaches just above 11 inches.</div><div><br></div><div>Playability</div><div>The playability is not bad. Sending people through the fireplace is fun. Also, the catapults work surprisingly well. It's fun having Bellatrix and Fenrir try to send fire through open windows! The Burrow does lose playability the farther up you go. The top bedroom only has a bed, goblet, and a copy of the Quibbler, while the middle bedroom has bunk beds, and a trunk with socks and galleons (gold studs) in it. The bottom level, being much larger than the bedrooms, has a good playability, with the pig pen, kitchen, dining table, front door, clock, etc.</div><div><br></div><div>The value for money is fair. As usual, it is 10 cents a piece, rounded up.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, it's a great set. The only big complaint I have is that it is based off a ""made-up"" scene from Half-Blood Prince (this isn't actually a flaw in the Lego set itself, though). However, since it gives us Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback, I can't complain much.</div><div><br></div><div>Sorry for the long review. Hope it was helpful, though! I'd suggest this set to any collector or big HP Lego fan, since the Burrow is a very important place in the Harry Potter world and this set has four new, important characters.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"brickbuilder711","2010-10-31T15:00:10.313Z","Above and Beyond the normal set!","<h4>Introduction</h4>Upon acquiring this set, I had a wonderful impression that the evident variety of accessories, figs, and the pig in this set would be something too good to pass up. More so, I had the impression that this would be a fun build with the exotic parts included.<br><br><h4>The Build</h4>The model is intelligently divided to four submodels;<br><ul><li>The patch of sand where canyons are fired and what appears to be a trap<br></li><li>The ground floor</li><li>The first floor roof<br></li><li>The last two stories</li></ul>The build was pretty intricate, which warranted the build process being interesting without a doubt. There are piece callouts in the instructions, which help to orient the builder to which parts are needed. <br><br><h4>Features</h4>This set has several features... The first floor is a kitchen and dining room, with a garden and a pig pen. The second floor is a bunk bedroom with neat details like a chest with clothes and the furnished beds. The third is merely a continuation. The accessories are abundant, warranting a high playability. <br><br><h4>Pros/Cons</h4>The pros are:<br><ul><li>Immense playability</li><li>COLORS! The earthy orange brick and dark red slope are not your run of the mill LEGO parts in most sets, the dark tan was nice too</li><li>Detail, this is not an abstract set like most city sets are</li><li>Price/Piece Ratio bearing circumstances - This set is 568 pieces at $60.00, a good value for the parts included being that this is even a licensed set</li><li>Lack of juniorization, The only piece that could be shortened is the dark tan base piece, but I see why they made it one piece for structure purposes</li></ul>The cons are:<br><ul><li>It looked from image searches that the white on the roof could have been dulled down to gray. <br></li><li>Another, but possibly cost inflating item that could have been implemented may have been a removable cover of the back of the house.

"sudorum","2010-09-28T16:59:06.27Z","Where are you, oh Ronald?","<p>It&#39;s been a long time since Lego dished out some Harry Potter sets. And I have to say, the newest additions to the theme live up to their predecessors. In my opinion, the burrow ranks as one of the best Harry Potter sets. It comes with Ginny, Harry, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Bellatrix, Fenrir Greyback, and two newly designed owls. Pretty much all of these minifigures are new, but I&#39;m wondering why this set doesn&#39;t include Ron. It is his house, right?! I guess his absence is just a ploy by Lego to convince customers to buy the Hogwart&#39;s Express (that&#39;s not happening). Anyway, the first floor is composed of the kitchen and dining room. The kitchen includes a sink and two cabinets; one that holds knives, the other a croissant. There are also two clocks and some kind of furniture piece. The dining area has a couple of cups, a plate of food, and ample seating arrangements. The second floor has a bunk bed and also a chest full of socks. The third floor, which is quite small, only has a bed, a lamp, and a newspaper. The set actually comes with two newspapers, one being the Quibbler and the other the Daily Prophet. Last, but not least, the burrow comes with a very small cornfield and a fireplace that ejects its &quot;occupant&quot; to simulate a flu powder teleportation. I highly recommend buying this set, even though it&#39;s predictably overpriced.</p>

That is not to say that it is not still a good set, (it is) but still.<div><br></div><div>My problem lies not in the bricks, but in the&nbsp;general feel of the whole set. It's wrong. The Burrow is one of the most happy, enchanting, light-hearted settings in all of the Harry Potter saga. It represents family, and magic, and general joyfulness. <i>This</i> Burrow is none of the above. It is a battlefield, a tense scene in which a battle is supposed to be happening.

"pod120","2011-01-20T07:29:14.553Z","""It's not much, but it's home""","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of six new 2010 HP sets, a line which many people thought had finished. Personally, I think that they new sets have a much greater extent of detail and attention to the books and films. All of the minifigs have been completely redesigned. Obviously, LEGO have based these sets on multiple books/fims in the series, as well as earlier LEGO set locations and events. This is the only 2010 HP set that is not based on a location or event that has already&nbsp;appeared in a LEGO set before. I&nbsp;received this set as a birthday present at the time these sets were first officially released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Harry Potter</em></strong> is now infamously known by many to appear in all of the 2010 HP sets. He has a double-sided head. One side is a smile and the other is a frown. A common complaint about this minifig is his hairpiece. The hairpiece doesn't bother me, but does appear very large on his head. The minifigs torso and legs are reasonably well detailed and go well together. I think that the torso goes better with black legs than it does with grey legs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Ginny Weasley</strong></em> is a minifig that was only seen in LEGO form once before 2010. She has a new hairpiece, which I think is very realistic. She has a double sided-head with one side a&nbsp;smile and the other side a frown. The detail on her torso and legs is fine detail. It is unfortunate that LEGO reused the torso later for a different character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Molly Weasley</strong></em> has never been seen before in LEGO form. Her LEGO debut is made impressive by the very fine detail on her torso and legs. The printings on her apron are extremely detailed. The face has good detail and reasonably good accuracy. The use of the original <em>Hermione</em> hairpiece was a clever decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Arthur Weasley</em></strong> also has good detail and accuracy. His legs do not have any unique printing, but his torso is a combination of interesting colours and detail. Similarly to <em>Molly</em> <em>Weasley</em>, his face is well detailed and reasonably accurate. I especially think his green jacket adds to the minifigs appearance. He has only ever appeared in LEGO form in this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Bellatrix Lestrange</em></strong> similarly to<em><strong> </strong>Ginny</em>, this minifig&nbsp;captures a splitting image of the character from the movies. She is one of a handful of important&nbsp;HP characters that had not been made into a minifig before 2010. The printings of her black dress are detailed beyond the detail that LEGO are obliged to provide. LEGO spared no expense with her hairpiece either. She has a double-sided head with one side an evil smile and the other side a scared expression. She has only appeared in LEGO form in this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Fenrir Greyback</em></strong> is probably the least important character in the set, but a good addition none the less. He offered a lot more excitement than the <em>Harry</em> minifig did. Like <em>Bellatrix</em>, this minifig shows a contrast in colours to the <em>Arthur</em> and <em>Molly</em>, which makes for a good variety of minifigs in the set. He has a very detailed, double-sided head with one side an evil grin and the other side a frown. It is arguable whether the haipiece makes the minifig's head look more or less accurate. His torso printings, like his face are very well detailed. This is his first LEGO appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Creatures</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>white owl [<em>Hedwig</em>]</p>
<p>grey owl [<em>Errol</em>]</p>
<p>pig</p>
<p>frog</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The range of creatures is quite good. All of the creatures are very interesting and to a certain extent, rare. The new owls are more blocky than the old ones, which to some people&nbsp;will be a positive and to others a negative. Their detail is unbelivable and it's great that all three of the new designs have a unique pattern. The back of the box art implies that the white owl is <em>Hedwig</em> and that the grey owl is<em> Errol</em>. The pig was an unecessary addition to the set, but one that it highly valued. The&nbsp;complex mould&nbsp;is great and I am very pleased that LEGO included this relatively new piece. I feel sorry for the frog because he quite often gets forgotten. Like the pig, he is unecessary, however highly valued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>gold goblet (2)</p>
<p>red mug (2)</p>
<p>lamp(2)</p>
<p>black wand (2)</p>
<p>brown wand </p>
<p>grey wand</p>
<p>beige wand</p>
<p>black broomstick</p>
<p>barrel</p>
<p>Quibbler</p>
<p>Daily Prophet</p>
<p>yellow plate</p>
<p>pan (2)</p>
<p>red cherries (2)</p>
<p>croissant</p>
<p>chest</p>
<p>golden snitch [coin] (2)</p>
<p>sock (2)</p>
<p>fire cone&nbsp;(4)</p>
<p>red cylinder (4)</p>
<p>knife (2)</p>
<p>fork (2)</p>
<p>stack of plates</p>
<p>flower pot (2)</p>
<p>flowers [2 white, 1 red]</p>
<p>flowers [2 red, 1 white]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I would not consider all of the above list accessories, there will be people out there who will, so I tried to name as many possible accessories as I could. I will not explain all of them in great detail, because there are a lot. Many of the accessories are part of every day life, especially when it comes to food and drink. The goblets, mugs, plate, cherries, croissant, knives, forks, pans and stack of plates provide a wealth of accessories of an amount far greater than usually seen in a LEGO set. Many of the pieces a few years ago, or even now may be considered rare. Then&nbsp;there are the&nbsp;common HP accessories which include the&nbsp;wands, broomstick and&nbsp;chest. Other accessories, such as lamps, fire cones and flower pots are included to add effective detail to the set. Opinions will differ about whether the socks are considered acceptable as tile bricks. The two golden snitches may be intented to be coins, and if so, this seems a bit weak, but is not something to complain about, as the set has a broad range of accessories. The red cylinders seem to be added so there is more catapult ammo. I don't quite understand why LEGO bothered to include them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The house</strong> is something I would consider an individual component. However, because of its size, I will divide the explaination into&nbsp;four parts.</p>
<p><strong>-The ground floor</strong> is extremely detailed and it's good to see that LEGO remember that there is more to a building than its exterior. The&nbsp;extended base&nbsp;is the only thing I don't like, as it comes apart from the rest of the building easily. Other than this, the structure of odd windows and&nbsp;pieces all manages to work together. The furniture, such as the clock, sink and kitchen cupboards are given in detail far beyond what I would have expected. These things probably only exist in a few other sets. What makes it better is that&nbsp;kitchen cupboards can open and their wacky colours don't appear unrealistic.&nbsp;The use of stickers to create detail is effective, but&nbsp;in some senses, not worth the excruciating concentration that is required to place a sticker accurately. The positionable chairs are a good addition and so is the gate to the pig pen, but I will explain more about that later.</p>
<p><strong>-The bedrooms</strong> are a good size and have differences from one another. The beds are a good choice of colour and it is good that they are postioned in different directions. The bunk bed is a&nbsp;good design which can fit two minifigs at once. The poster next to the bunk bed is a nice detail and is an indication of LEGO's attention to the books as well as films. Two 2x2 single stud tiles make up a space to place the chest. The top bedroom is infact in the roof. It is smaller, but has space inside the window, where a green poster is on the wall. I like LEGO's creative use of the single gold stud throughout the interior of the set.</p>
<p>-<strong>The exterior</strong> is very clever with its detail and how different pieces manage to fit together to create an asymmetrical structure. The shape is very similar to what is seen in the films. The uses of different shaped bricks is clever and works well. I particularly like the roof tiles. The hanging wood planks and the chimneys add good detail. The windows are very clever how different types are used and all are postioned in a different way. The use of the blue colour does not look out of place.</p>
<p><strong>-The pig pen</strong> is a great addition to the side of the house. The two gates open nicely to allow access outside the pen or inside the house. The pen and its green base&nbsp;give a good sense of the outside of the house and that the set includes more environment than just the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The fireplace</strong> is a good size and adds to the interior of the house. The play feature works reasonably well if the lever is spun at the right speed. If you don't think that it works very well, than you are probably spinning it too fast.&nbsp;A fez hat is used for the lever, which when place upside down may mean to represent the pot of floo powder seen in the movie. The paintings on top and the green flames are nice details, but are infact stickers. Window panels are used to create the base of the fireplace. Because of this, a minifig cannot stand upright in the fireplace unless&nbsp;the minifig&nbsp;is leaning over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The marshland</strong> is something in the set that I value a lot and are pleased that it was included. It gives a sense of there being more to the set than just the house. You also get some of the environment around it. The marshland's detail shows rocks, water and bushes and looks very accurate to what is seen in the movie. A catapult is also mounted on the marshland's base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The other catapult</strong> is individual and is a good addition to the set.&nbsp;The catapult&nbsp;would not be reason why anyone would buy the set, because the catapult does work, but can only minimally be controlled to adjust height and accuracy. It seems like its there to reenact the scene in the movie, rather than for someone to have a&nbsp;catapult contest with a friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Which Movie?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Burrow does not appear in&nbsp;the first, third or fifth films and only appears briefly in the fourth. Many believe that this set is based on the six film. I would say that it is mostly based on the sixth, but has references to the second film as well. These include the pig pen, dining table and floo powder fireplace. The marshland is an obvious reference to the sixth film. The range of minifigs is very ideal to the scenes at the Burrow in the sixth film. However <em>Harry</em>,<em> Ginny</em>,<em> Molly </em>and<em> Arthur</em> appear in just about all of the scenes at the Burrow throughout the HP series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The house is one of the most detailed LEGO buildings I&nbsp;have seen that is not a LEGO.com exclusive. The building experience is reasonably complex when building the house. It is actually quite difficult to keep all of the&nbsp;segments together until you have built up to the second storey. The range of parts is excellent, especially when it comes to accessories, furniture and the different bricks used to create the structure of the house. The playability&nbsp;will differ between different people. If you enjoy your LEGO characters exploring in and out the house with a blend of recreating scenes and observating a detailed model, then you will get good enjoyment out of this set. If you have a short imagination and require a lot of play features, well then I can't promise anything when it comes to playability. The value for money is great when you consider that there is a broad range of pieces and colours that you won't find in&nbsp;every LEGO set. The best thing about this set for me is the amazing attention to detail, which is equally shared on both the interior and exterior. There aren't many negatives for me other than the extended base often falls away from the rest of the structure&nbsp;and&nbsp;the stickers, which some are very tedious to apply. A negative for many people will be the absence of <em>Ron</em>. Although the 2010 HP sets where designed for the buyer to collect more to increase&nbsp;their range of characters, that excuse won't cut it for <em>Ron</em> not being included in his own house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is probably the best of the 2010 HP as a stand alone. Other than <em>Ron</em>, there isn't much you can add to the environment. It is a very good set if you only want to get one HP set, as it has a good range of accessories and creatures and is the only Burrow that LEGO have made. It also works well as just an ordinary LEGO house. Obviously, you will get this set if you intent to get all of the 2010 HP sets, but if you just want a reasonably big HP set with a good range of characters, creatures and accessories, with reasonably good playability, then this is a good set for you. If you wish to get <em>Ron</em>, <em>4738 Hagrid's</em> <em>Hut</em> includes him, as well as <em>Hermione</em>, however both are&nbsp;wearing school uniform. In <em>10217</em> <em>Diagon Alley</em> and <em>4841 Hogwarts Express</em>, <em>Ron</em> is included wearing casual clothes. <em>10217 Diagon Alley</em> also includes a casual <em>Hermione</em> and a<em> Fred</em> and<em> George</em>.&nbsp;If this&nbsp;is you first HP set, I doubt you will be disappointed.</p>

"legospongepotter","2011-06-15T21:10:49.227Z","""This is the best house I've ever been in"" - Harry Potter","I own many Lego sets, but Harry Potter: The Burrow is one of the best, second only to Hogwarts Castle. This is the only 2010 HP set that is not a remake of a previous set, and I'm quite glad they finally did make it. It contains six minifigures, 4 of which are brand new (however, now one of them has been added to another set), a functioning floo-powder fireplace, a small swamp, and the Burrow. I'll start with the minifigures.<div><br></div><h4>Minifigures:</h4><div><b>Harry Potter: </b>The hero and titular character of the franchise. In 2010 and 2011 he has come in two different variations. One is the casual-clothing Harry and the Hogwarts-uniform Harry. In this set we get casual Harry. He has thick messy hair and a flesh-colored, double-sided face. On both sides he has his round glasses and a red lightning scar on his forehead. On one side he has a smile, one side he has a frown. His torso (which is the one thing that changes Hogwarts Harry to Casual Harry) is a blue jacket over a light-blue t-shirt. His jacket has two pockets on either side and a silver zipper lining the inside edge of the jacket. Underneath is a normal t-shirt. On the back is some jacket lines for a design. He comes with black legs and a standard brown wand.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Ginerva ""Ginny"" Weasley: </b>Ginny is &nbsp;the younger sister of Ron. Though there was a Ginny in the Hogwarts Express set, she had Gryffindor robes on. Her clothing was added to Hermione Granger (not&nbsp;featured&nbsp;in this set) in Diagon Alley. She has orange hair, long enough that is stretched down her back a little. She has a double-sided face. On one side is a happy/neural expression. She has orange eyebrows and faint freckles. her mouth (with some lipstick) seems to be a straight line, though one side is raised a little, like she's almost smiling or it's a &nbsp;half-smile. It's hard to tell.One side has an obvious frown. Her new torso is also a jacket. It's gray and sipped up with red zig-zags for detail A white t-shirt is&nbsp;visible&nbsp;under the jacket. On the back is more zig-zags. The legs she gets is new. It is mainly scarlet&nbsp;with&nbsp;some&nbsp;pockets with zippers.&nbsp;She&nbsp;gets a beige wand like Albus Dumbledore's in Hogwarts.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Arthur Weasley: </b>The father of Ron, Ginny, and the other Weasley kids. He has never been made in&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;form before, so it's good to have him. He's not balding like in the books, but he comes with short messy hair colored orange. This hairpiece is the only that can be found in other themes. It would've been interesting to see a balding hairpiece. His face is not double-sided. Instead you get Mr. Weasley grinning with some wrinkles from age and smiling. he has thick eyebrows. His torso is also new. It is an interesting shade of green, sort of light green and dark green together. It's sort of a jacket you'd see in a tuxedo. It reminds me of that jacket Sherlock Holmes wears. There are buttons and straps and such. Under is a plaid shirt. On the back is&nbsp;just&nbsp;some lines you'd expect on a jacket. A straps, a few lines of stress, possibly indicating second-hand jacket considering how poor the Weasleys are. Arthur comes with light gray legs and a light gray wand to match his pants.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Molly Weasley: </b>Mother of the Weasley kids and wife to Arthur. I love the detail you get with Mrs. Weasley. I believe everything is new with her.She has orange hair that's like Ginny's but shorter and kind of rests on her shoulders. She does not have a&nbsp;double-sided face. She has a smile on her face with some wrinkles from smiling and age. I do have some problems with her face though. Readers of the book will note that despite her often kind personality, when she's angry, she's furious and she had a short temper. She was often seen shouting at her naughty children. I think an angry face would've been appropriate if Lego had another side to her face. Her legs and torso is almost connected. Let me explain. It's the printing. She has a normal torso and legs, but the printing continues throughout all of it. She has n apron with a brown lining and sort of tan center with red spots. On her torso there is a pocket containing sewing needles. A couple flowers hang from her apron. The printing makes it look like she has a red scarf around her neck. There are more flowers on her legs. She has a beige sweater under the apron. She has legs the same color as the apron and on the back of her torso is just the string to tie the apron to her. Molly does not come with a wand.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Fenrir Grayback: </b>A werewolf and servant to the evil Lord Voldemort. He was a new&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;until he was added into Diagon Alley. I really like this minifigure. He's got really sleek brown hair that looks almost fancy. He has a double-sided face. Both sides feature his face covered in brown hair and these wide pale blue-white eyes. One side features his triumph face, teeth bared in a grin. The other features a more&nbsp;serious&nbsp;look with his mouth closed tightly. His torso is pretty cool. He's got a cool black&nbsp;trench-coat&nbsp;(I believe) with a gray shirt underneath that has a way too long neck-hole. You can see some of his hairy chest. He's got a small brown belt. On the back of his torso is nothing, just pure black. He has black legs and a black wand.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Bellatrix Lestrange: </b>Another evil servant of Lord Voldemort, a Death Eater. This is my favorite minifigure, and I don't know how to describe her. It's her hair really, and it's hard to describe with words, so I'd recommend scrolling up to look at the picture of Bellatrix instead. her hair is black and so...big. It is very messy and crazed with disheveled hair everywhere. Part of it covers her face and part of it stretches down her back in a pony-tail. Her face is double-sided. She has sunken eyes (very evil) and red lipstick on both sides of her face. One side shows her laughing evilly. Another has her teeth chattering in fright for some reason. She has a very detailed dress on. It's black and has many silver designs. She is wearing a silver necklace. Instead of legs she has a black dress piece with more silver designs and brown knife-holder hanging from her waist. She comes with a black wand.</div><div><br></div><h4>Floo-Powder Fireplace</h4><div>This is a tall gray fireplace that works&nbsp;like&nbsp;floo-powder. In case you don't know what floo powder is, let me explain. In Harry Potter, you throw this powder into a fireplace. The flames will turn green and you step into the fire and speak the name of your desired location. You will appear in a fireplace at your location. This fireplace is tall and gray. On the top is a couple portraits of two wizards. One is a painter and one is an author/philosopher. Errol, a gray owl with some owl printing on him, rests on the mantle. Inside the fireplace is a wall with studs and a little red fire going on. On the outside under the fire is a wooden board just for effect. &nbsp;On the side of the fireplace is a little knob that is actually supposed to be a smokestack or a pipe or something similar. You are supposed to put a Minifigure in the fire place and quickly turn the knob backwards, which also turns the actually fireplace backward. You then see green flames (stickers) jumping in the air. It works well and is a great play feature.</div><div><br></div><h4>Swamp</h4><div>This is just a little swamp bit that's sort of like a&nbsp;home-base&nbsp;for the bad guys. It has a dark tan&nbsp;octagonal&nbsp;base. Two weed/plant pieces colored dark gran stand guard on either side. In the back is a catapult next to a little rock. Light blue smooth pieces, giving off a water impression are scattered around. Four flames are lit and stand around, waiting to be tossed. A little green frog waits, frightened by the action. There is also a separate little catapult with four neon red&nbsp;cylinders&nbsp;waiting to be thrown. That's a little useless, but&nbsp;the&nbsp;whole swamp is decent.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Burrow</h4><p>The house itself is really awesome. It's three stories tall and has this rugged look to it. The walls are made of red, tan, orange tan, and brown and dark brown double&nbsp;cylinder&nbsp;pieces. There are lots of windows. I'll go floor to floor</p><p><br></p><p><b>First Floor</b></p><p><b><i>Exterior</i></b></p><p>The outside of the &nbsp;first floor is awesome. On one side is a window with light blue shutters. Up front is another window besides an old fashioned brown door with a golden little window. A little roof hangs over it. On the other side is another window, but white this time, with two flower pots with flowers in them. &nbsp;On the far right is a little pigsty with two boards to keep the pig in. The pig inside is a standard pink pig with a stud on top. Another little door on the other side of his stable leads to the interior of the first floor.&nbsp;</p><p>The roof of the first floor is kind of like the foundation of the rest of the building. It's a lot of new scarlet roof pieces all leading gradually up until it connects with wall. Up front is a little small roof. There is also a window which is part of the second floor room.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Interior</i></b></p><p>The inside is awesome. It's a full kitchen with lots of home features. It's a large room that takes up all of the first floor. You enter through the door and on your left is a cupboard with a&nbsp;croissant&nbsp;inside (this is probably an oven because there is one of those oven tops on the cupboard). A sink is in the corner by the two windows, which is next to a couple drawers. On he drawer is four white dishes. In one drawer there are a couple kitchen knives (you can give these to Bellatrix for play) and in another is what could be two forks. On your right is a grandfather clock. The bottom half has that swinging...thing. The top has the actual clock, telling the time. Next to that by the window is a small desk with a little lamp. Hanging from one wall is a black broom. Hanging from another is two gray pans. There is a table in the center with two red mugs, two goblets, a copy of the Daily Prophet, and a yellow plate with two red cherries on it. Two benches are on either side. Flanking one side of the table is two swiveling brown chairs. On the other is a little green stool besides a barrel, which is where I put wands. Hanging from the ceiling is a little chandelier.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>Second Floor</b></p><p>The second and third floors also and made up of only one room and are bedrooms.</p><p><b><i>Exterior</i></b></p><p>The viewer's left side of the house is a wall made up of those brown double round pieces seen in Pirates sets. So is the rest of the floor. It has a few dark pieces instead of light brown. The left side has a window with white shutters. There is also a little board that is supposed to hang down from one stud and look like it's broken or falling off to give the Burrow a shabby look. In the front is another window with white shutters and a longer tan board hanging. On the right side is yet another awesome hanging board but a window with blue shutters. Over it is a little roof/awning thing that kind of reminds me of stairs. It's covered in light blue tiles.</p><p><b><i>Interior</i></b></p><p>Inside it is very crowded. On the right is a bunk bed. The beds have white pillows and blue and orange sheets. There is a brown trunk on the right with another owl, Hedwig, resting on top. Even though Harry sleeps on the top floor, it makes me wonder if this is Harry's room. However, Harry does sleep in Ron's room, which is the top floor. Anyways, inside the trunk is a couple tiles with black printed socks on them which is always cool. There are also some gold studs in it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>Third Floor and Roof</b></p><p>The final room and top floor is pretty small but has a great view.</p><p><b><i>Exterior</i></b></p><p>There's more roof here, so the room is built on the roof. It's like the roof and room is one. A window with blue shutters stick out of the red roof. There are identical windows on either side of the room. A little chimney/pipe sticks out from one of the side. On top there's more roof that&nbsp;comes&nbsp;to an end with two more little chimneys sticking up.</p><p><b><i>Interior</i></b></p><p>I do like some of the detail in this room, but I don't think I&nbsp;like&nbsp;it a lot. Lego did do good and made the exterior of the entire Burrow look great, but the last two rooms are too crowded and too empty. On top, spanning the entire width of the room is another bed. Next to it is a little niche in the wall. It kind of juts out and ends with the window,&nbsp;like&nbsp;a little storage room. There is a copy of the Quibbler and a lamp here in this storage part and on a wall is a Chudley Cannons Quidditch Poster.</p><p><br></p><h4>Overall</h4><div>I really do like this set a lot, even though the last two rooms could be better. I love the minifigures and the fireplace and the kitchen. However, like another reviewer said, the feel of the set it wrong. The Burrow is a warm, happy place where Harry was happy, and the first time we see it in Lego there is only three Weasleys when we could've had Fred, George, Percy, Charlie, or Bill. I think Ron should've been here too since it's his house. Instead we get two Death Eaters. While they're great, I think Lego should make a Malfoy Manor set and add them instead. However, it's still a good set and I would highly&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;it to anyone who likes Legos. Thanks for reading.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

This set is extremely cool.&nbsp; The style lego designed this set is very interesting and unique.<br />
I like the kitchen for the unique way it was built and its detail.&nbsp; The Family room<br />
is also built in a uniquely built and the house is all well furnished and catches the<br />
scenes in the movie.&nbsp; The minifigures are perfect and they look just like the characters from the acting.The upstaris area is well designed and organized.<br />

There are very few cons but i must point them out.&nbsp; Beatrix Lestranges negative expression looks frightenend and scared=nothing like Beatrix personality and the fact it costs <br />
so much money is quite unreasonable.&nbsp; Other than that most of this set is very well designed.<br />

When I built the Burrow, It took me all day. After I was finished the
 2 top levels would not fit exactly on the kitchen. There was one time 
when there was a golden bridge looking piece on top of the kitchen, and 
it told me to put it somewhere, but it wouldn't fit because 2 other 
bricks were stopping it. Lets face it, I love this set, but there are 
some cons that you have to watch out for. Hope I helped!",TRUE,4,3,2,5,3

"HungerGamer","2014-03-17T20:02:10.943Z","The Burrow Review","<p>The Harry Potter series brought us many different and complex locations located in the Wizarding Universe, the Burrow is one of the most famous. This set is actually quite cool. This set will look nicely on a corner of a table and is a must-get set for any Harry Potter fans. This set was also the first Harry Potter set I got and is actually one of my favorites of them all. The six minifigures&nbsp;help to recreate the scenes in the Burrow for young children and will provide hours of playtime. I have to say, this was quite a difficult build but was defiantly&nbsp;worth it in the end! 8/10</p>

"HarleyMeenen","2016-08-30T05:19:53.163Z","Visually Interesting, Great Minifigs","<p>Easily one of the best parts of this set is the minifigs. Several of them are only available with this set, and they are all quite well designed. Half of them have two faces, and the details are quite nice, especially for Bellatrix and Fenrir.</p>

<p>The details associated with the attack are mediocre- a few catapults to launch fiery&nbsp;bricks. The other side piece is a fireplace for the Floo network, which does look pretty cool with the changing flames.</p>

<p>The central piece is the Burrow itself, which is the other crowning detail of the set. Both the kitchen area and the bedrooms include small details to make it really seem like a home, and there&#39;s just enough askew to reflect the spirit of the Burrow and the Weasleys. It&#39;s also a pretty solid structure.</p>

<p>I would personally have thought a Ron minifigure would be a nice addition, since its his house and his bedroom is even featured. Aside from that, be warned that this set includes a lot of stickers, some on small pieces. Most of these could be left off without much impact.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a cool set with some unique aspects that looks quite cool when finished. I would recommend it.</p>

"sideswinger","2019-11-05T15:39:23.22Z","A Pretty Good Set","<p>So this was a set that my brother got back in the day, and at the time, I really enjoyed playing with LEGO as well, and when he got it all built up, I was hyped to play with it. I do think that my overall rating of this would be a 4.6. The only reason it&#39;s not a whole 5 is because even though the house looks spectacular, it isn&#39;t really very screen-accurate. But like I said, it is still spectacular. I really like the color scheme of it, with the dark brown, and dark red, and it just has an overall great design. the interior is pretty packed with detail as well. I do like the two side-builds as well, with the catapult play feature, as well as the floo powder build. I think the building experience is probably at a 3.. I think it&#39;s pretty fun, but it does get just a slight bit tedious with the two rooms. the pieces in here are pretty useful, like the Molly figure, as well as bellatrix, and it comes with a lot of roof pieces, which are pretty useful to me. the playability of it is pretty high, you can pretend to shoot the fire balls with that catapult into the house, which was something I enjoyed as a kid.I do think that the value of this set is pretty good for the most part. I think $60 is a great price, for these marvelous minifigures, great build, and some pretty nice pieces.</p>
