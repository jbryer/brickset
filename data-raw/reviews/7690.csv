"legospongepotter","2011-01-12T13:20:34.84Z","""Anyone sitting there? Everywhere else is full,"" - Ron Weasley  ","Thankfully, no one was sitting next to Harry on that first train ride, or Ron might have never been friends with Harry. Okay, let's begin my review of the Hogwarts Express. If you don't like long reviews, skip to the last section that says 'Hogwarts&nbsp;Express Quick Review'<div><br></div><h4>Story Time</h4><div>I didn't really mean to ever own this. My brother was saving up for Diagon Alley and had a hundred bucks, but when we saw it at Wal-Mart, he decided to get this set and neither of us regret this. It is the largest set either of us owns with about 650 pieces and every&nbsp;Minifigure&nbsp;is new in some way (but Ron and Harry here are in Diagon Alley.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, now that that's settled, let's begin the second review for the Hogwarts Express.</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigures</h4><div>You get five awesome Minifigures, and all are new in some way, besides Ron and Harry because of Diagon Alley. Let's begin.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Harry Potter - </b>He's a great Minifigure, but if you have other 2010/2011 HP sets, he's not amazing. He's got black hair that's all messy, of course. It's a little shorter than the&nbsp;original&nbsp;hair piece in old sets to represent Daniel Radcliffe's haircut. He's got his glasses and red scar on both sides of his face. On one side he's smiling, the other he's frowning. Malfoy probably entered their compartment.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Harry's jacket is very cool. It has a&nbsp;silver&nbsp;zipper and it's dark blue. It has two pockets, one on either side. They are light blue. On the back it is mainly dark blue, besides two light blue stripes, one big, one small. Harry has normal light gray pants. Harry comes with a normal brown wand. Harry also gets his invisibility cloak. It&nbsp;basically&nbsp;this big bit of white cloth tinted pink and green. When you put it on Harry, it&nbsp;covers&nbsp;him up until his feet, which makes sense from the last few books. But Harry alone should be able to walk around&nbsp;completely&nbsp;invisible. It also sticks out to the side awkwardly. It makes it even worse if you give Harry a wand, so I'm not crazy about his invisibility cloak. It should've been longer and made of sturdier material like some new cloaks.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Ron Weasley - </b>This is my second Ron and only in casual clothing (I could say the same for Harry, but I have three). He's a nice Minifigure. He has lots of orange hair, made to look like a surfer's or&nbsp;skater's. Nice and long design, and it fits Ron. Ron is also double-sided. You can see his orange eyebrows and freckles on both sides. He's smiling on one side, and is scared on the other. His teeth are showing when he's scared.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Ron has a nice sweater on. It's a bright red with nice square designs. He has a red&nbsp;collar and a gray T-shirt underneath. Flip it over you get the same square design as the front. Ron's arms are brown, unlike the rest of his torso.&nbsp;Something&nbsp;about&nbsp;this torso makes me think that Ron is going to stay at 5766 Log Cabin. Ron has normal black pants. He also, like Harry, gets a brown wand. It would be cool of Lego included his dress robes from the fourth book.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Draco Malfoy - </b>Okay, so the next three Minifigures I do not own, while I have a Ron and harry from other sets, these are my first Minifigures of these guys from these sets. Okay, so I have Malfoy. He has blond (or bright yellow) hair that is designed to look sleek and slick. The haircut is new entirely, I believe, to any set ever besides Quidditch Match. I&nbsp;just&nbsp;love the new design, it's than that old boring hair. Malfoy has two faces, but I'm not sure about one. He has got dark eyebrows for some strange reason, because I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;Malfoy was blond. He's smirking on one side and he's scared on the other side, with a curly mouth and raised eyebrows. I don't think this face is great. It was good in Quidditch Match but here he should have a different expression, maybe even angrier or more relaxed.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Malfoy has an exclusive torso. This is the only Slytherin Outfit, so if you want a bunch of Slytherins, you'll need lots of torsos&nbsp;like&nbsp;this. It's gray and has the Slytherin shield near his heart. It's green with a silver snake. He has a blue&nbsp;shirt&nbsp;underneath and a green and silver tie (I'm glad Lego is using the Slytherin colors). On the back he's just got some wrinkles and a green/silver&nbsp;line. Malfoy has black pants and a nice&nbsp;black&nbsp;wand.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Ginny Weasley - </b>She is a very nice Minifigure. I'll start with the new orange hair piece. It's long so it goes from either side of her face down to her&nbsp;shoulders. It flows freely in the back. However, there's some a little Un-Ginny about her, like she looks a little like a girl when I think she was a tomboy. I mean, yeah she's&nbsp;supposed&nbsp;to look&nbsp;like&nbsp;a girl but the hair is too girly. Ginny has a great head. She's not really smiling, just kind of bored on one side with her mouth in a straight line and eyebrows looking normal. You can also see her freckles. In the back her eyebrows are pointed down and her mouth is a frown.</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Ginny has the&nbsp;normal&nbsp;Gryffindor outfit. It is dark gray with a red and gold Gryffindor shield and a black lion. She has a blue shirt and red/gold tie. Her outfit also has a gold and red line witch continues to the back, which also has some wrinkles. &nbsp;Ginny has black pants like the normal Gryffindor and she owns a brown wand.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Luna Lovegood - </b>Luna is&nbsp;definitely<b>&nbsp;</b>my favorite minifigure. First, her great hair. It is one of those Agents hair pieces, I believe. It has along pony tail in the back and sort of parts in the front. It is bright yellow, brighter than Malfoy's. It is very unique and looks great.Luna is double-sided, of course. She has bright pink lipstick on for both sides. One on side she is wearing her Spectrespecs. They are big gold glasses with these bits sticking out&nbsp;like&nbsp;fingers. The lens is white, and one has a pink spiral design, the other has blue. Luna's mouth is opened in surprise. On&nbsp;Luna's&nbsp;other face she is normal, with a smiling mouth and you can notice her light brown eyebrows. Does Lego hate yellow eyebrows?</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Luna's pink torso is something to stare at. It is a pink jacket with some pickets, a collar, lots of buttons and wrinkles and folds. On the back you see&nbsp;something&nbsp;that holds her coat together. It has more wrinkles and more pink designs. Luna has blue pants. They have some black printing that is covered with yellow, blue, and green stars, so it is very unique and is great for Luna. Lego did a great job designing her. Luna also gets a brown wand.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Okay, now that the awesome Minifigures are done with, let's get to the many&nbsp;accessories.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Accessories</h4><div>Quibbler - A 4x4 smooth piece with the words 'The Quibbler' in big red letters. It has a headline of 'Harry Potter Speaks Out At Last' and in red lines underneath it says 'Nargles in Mistletoe' which is very cool. it has a picture of Lego Harry. This is very cool. It is mainly light gray.</div><div><br></div><div>Daily Prophet - This paper says 'The Daily Prophet' in big fancy letter and also says 'Exclusive&nbsp;Photos from Mayhem at High Security Prison' and ' Mass Breakout from Azkaban' up front. It has a sketch of Azkaban, a big triangular tower. It is mainly light yellow.</div><div><br></div><div>Trunk - This is just a normal treasure chest that opens up. There is a black spider on top. Inside you get lots of goodies. There is four jewels. Two are red and two are clear. There is also these two fairy wands. It has a handle and ends in a star. One is pink and one is green. They might be Luna's and the jewels might be Malfoy's.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Rat - You get a normal gray rat with a long tail. It is probably Ron's rat, Scabbers, or Wormtail.</div><div><br></div><div>Hedwig - I am loving these printed owls. Hedwig has amber eyes and lots of feathers on her body. Ever her beak is&nbsp;printed&nbsp;black and her talons are there too. In the back her wings stretch out as well as her tail.</div><div><br></div><div>Errol - He is a nice gray owl with yellow eyes and beak. His body is light blue with brown spots.</div><div><br></div><div>Pigwidgeon - I don't think this is Ron's owl, but I'm just going to pretend. He's brown and has big yellow eyes. His body is kind of green-ish if you look closely.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Candy Trolley - This is a&nbsp;nice&nbsp;red&nbsp;trolley&nbsp;with a golden handle. There is a small door with a Honeydukes sticker on it, but there's nothing inside. On the other side is a Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans sticker. On top is a very cool and possibly rare ice-cream piece. It is white and has four scoops, three on the bottom and one on top. It is one of my favorite parts. There is a frog, too. A Chocolate Frog, colored brown so it&nbsp;looks&nbsp;like candy. Another great part.</div><div><br></div><div>Keys - You get two gray keys, the same from Hagrid's Hut.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>With all those&nbsp;accessories&nbsp;done it's time to move on to the bigger parts of this set. I'll start with the flying Ford Angela.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Flying Ford Angela</h4><div>This car is unique because of its color and&nbsp;design. Maybe it's because I don't own many Lego Cars, but it seems pretty big. It also fits two Minifigures. On the outside is&nbsp;some&nbsp;headlights and the blue hood. Move on and there is a car window six studs across. There is a 6x6 white baseplate as a roof which can be easily&nbsp;removed, revealing two&nbsp;seats&nbsp;for Ron and Harry, a steering wheel, and a blue antenna piece. There are two light blue doors on either side which easily open. In the back there is two red lights. A nice design is this slop piece to make it look older. My favorite part of the car is the trunk. It easily lifts open like a real trunk, revealing a black suitcase. The wheels also have a nice metal design. This car is&nbsp;definitely amazing and worth it. In a few years, you could probably sell it alone on eBay for thirty to&nbsp;forty&nbsp;dollars. I just really like this car.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, so I believe that I've covered everything except the train itself. Let's begin.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Hogwarts Express</h4><div>What can I say? It is very life-like. A train fan would have to get this. This is my only train and I didn't expect to get it until after I owned Hogwarts, the Burrow, and Diagon Alley, but my brother decided he wanted it and we love it. We had a great time building it (if me doing 90 percent of the work is 'we' then yes).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It has three sections. One is the passenger area, one is a storage area, and in front is the driver's area. Sorry, I'm not too sure what they're called. I'm starting with the driver's area.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Driver's Area</b></div><div>I love how realistic it is. I'm going to start up front. It is mainly black. There is a circle piece that says 'Hogwarts Express 5972' on it. This piece&nbsp;spins&nbsp;and has an antenna on it. There is some lights and lots of elaborate detail. The wheels move smoothly and look good there. There is some slanted pieces here and there. Then the main part of the train is sort of circular. It has some nice gold Prince of Persia pieces. A stud, a mini-dome and and two 4x4 circular pieces. All this is on top. The gold 4x4 pieces are part of a cool chimney. There is two long sticks on the side for detail. On the bottom is some rec pieces and a sticker that says 'Hogwarts Castle'. Both sides are identical.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The inside area is also detailed. On the&nbsp;outside&nbsp;of it is two cool red&nbsp;windows&nbsp;and a big black roof that looks like a half oval. Inside is some standing room for a Minifigure. There is some controls&nbsp;against&nbsp;the wall, like&nbsp;those&nbsp;things&nbsp;that look like&nbsp;clocks but measure heat. There is some claws that move up and down. Then there is this box with a handle and coal pieces inside.You put this box in a section that looks&nbsp;like&nbsp;a hole. Because of this, only the handle protrudes. You can move those claw pieces all the way down so they touch the handle, then slowly pull the box out, making the claws go up. I think this is a very cool feature. The whole driver's area is big and realistic, making me change my before unimpressed idea about trains. This is just amazing. This is just fantastic. This&nbsp;is&nbsp;only the beginning of the train.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Storage Area -</b>&nbsp;The next part of the train is the smallest, and my least favorite. It's great, but it's third on my&nbsp;list, but&nbsp;that&nbsp;doesn't mean I hate it. On the outside it's really only red wall and some black sticks hanging from the&nbsp;outside&nbsp;to make it look cool. There is two stickers for each side. Really, they are two halves of a sticker that says Hogwarts Railways and has the Hogwarts shield in the middle. You&nbsp;have&nbsp;to line them up perfectly, so it's annoying. This is for both sides.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>There is a big door on top that should swing open but for me it doesn't open all the way, so whenever we want to out in or take out stuff, we have to take off this big door. I don't think this is for all of them though. Inside you get more&nbsp;accessories. You get two brown suitcases and three wand-cases. These are basically a 1x3 piece with a 1x3 smooth piece on top of each other, and a sticker of a wand. There is a gray,&nbsp;light&nbsp;gray, and black case. The gray one has a red seal on it and a wand. The black has a gold wand on red velvet. The light gray case has a brown wand on gold velvet. Lots of stuff, all are great. My brother also put the newspapers in there. It's a good place for the&nbsp;accessories, but the trunk won't fit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Seating Area - </b>This isn't amazing, but it's was done well. On the outside is a bunch of red walls with ten great windows. Four are on the sides, the other two at the ends. There is a nice black roof too that comes off easily but it is pretty firm in there. I'm not crazy about the&nbsp;inside, but it's done well.<b>&nbsp;</b></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space: pre; font-weight: bold; "">	</span>There are four brown chairs. Each two is in between a tiny table. On table has a golden goblet, one has&nbsp;more&nbsp;ice-cream. The whole inside is 4 studs across to you don't get compartments and there is no room for the trolley. However, on each end there is lots of room, so you can keep the trolley there. This area is as big as the Driver's area, but the inside could be way better. Of course, the train would need to be wider and have&nbsp;lots&nbsp;of room. It's still pretty cool, but I have the least to say about it.</div><div><br></div><h4>Hogwarts Express Quick Review</h4><div>This is just to quickly explain the set if you don't want to read all of it, sort of like a summary.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You get five Minifigures: Harry, Ron, Luna, Ginny, and Malfoy. They all are double-sided. They all get wands. You get three owls and a candy trolley, a couple keys, a trunk with some stuff, a rat, and two newspapers.&nbsp;</div><div><b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There is also a blue car that fits two Minifigures and has a trunk that opens. The train is really cool. Up front is the well-designed driver's area that has this device with coal. Then there is a storage area with&nbsp;stem&nbsp;suitcases and wand cases. It's pretty small. Finally there's a place for people with some chairs and s couple tables. Overall, it's a good set.</div><div><br></div><h4>Overall</h4><div>Okay, I hope you didn't only read the quick review. This set is really cool, worth it. Eighty bucks is a little expensive, but it's&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;worth it. It's a great set if you're going to need students for your Hogwarts (I wish Luna was in Hogwarts, with a Ravenclaw outfit). Train fans and Harry Potter fans would love this, and this train really takes it. That's it for my review, and thanks for reading.&nbsp;</div><div>And get this set.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Berrus_Brickus","2011-01-16T16:19:31.417Z","Ol' Red","<p>I write my introductions last and I am tired from writing the minifigures section, after a spelling lesson. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>You may notice that throughout the review, I alternate between the spelling of blonde/blond.&nbsp; This is because it is one of the few words in the English language that has a male and female spelling.&nbsp; It is also the reason that females are the only gender classified as <em>""dumb blondes.""</em></p>
<p><em>Blond: Used to describe a male</em></p>
<p><em>Blonde: Used to describe a female.&nbsp; Jokes are often made about females with blonde hair.</em></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The intructions and boxare in the same format as all of the other 2010 Harry Potter sets.&nbsp; I really don't want to waste time talking about them.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Some nice parts like chocolate frogs, goblets,&nbsp;and ice cream.&nbsp; The owls are amazing, and for whatever reason are not on the front of the box or instructions. Also included is the traditional Hogwarts Express radar piece which has been used on all four versions of the engine (counting this and the motorized one).&nbsp; There are also a few pearl gold elements on the engine which is an improvement over the other three which all used yellow instead.&nbsp; The invisibility cloak included is a piece of cloth which is in it's own little box.&nbsp; I personally think that it would have been a better choice for it to have been included in <em>Hagrid's Hut </em>instedead.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p><strong>Harry Potter:</strong></p>
<p>The star of the set (and all of the others sadly).&nbsp;He is almost identical to his counterpart in the&nbsp;<em>Burrow </em>with a minor improvement.&nbsp;He has his classic hair piece, a double face (extremly happy and angry), a blue jacket (which I think is an updated version of the one he wairs in the Gringott's set), dark grey pants (works much better than the black ones in the <em>Burrow), </em>and another brown wand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ron Weasley:</strong></p>
<p>Harry's best friend.&nbsp; He is amazing head/hair-wise but his choice in clothing is terrible.<em>&nbsp;</em>He's supposed to be a poor character and a vest doesn't do a great job at showing that.&nbsp; A jacket, hand-knitted sweater, or simply adding red arms to his torso would have been much better.&nbsp; The black pants really don't match the torso. Blue in either dark, sand, or even classic would have worked better.&nbsp; On the other hand, his face is great! On one side he has a large smile that is probably result of growing up with Fred and George.&nbsp; On the other side his mouth is open wide like he is face to face with an acromantula (giant spider) or flying a car at a dangerous speed through the sky.&nbsp; One thing that I like about his new face is that it is not all that different from his GbltOfF face which offers two different expressions. He carries a brown wand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ginny Weasley:</strong></p>
<p>Ron's little sister.&nbsp; She is much improved from her ChmbrOfScrts rendition (which a lot of people don't know about, go look it up in huw's great Harry Potter figure gallery).&nbsp; She has the new Gryffindor robes which actually go great with the black pants.&nbsp; Her face offers a smile similar to Ron's, just more female and smaller.&nbsp; On the other side, it is like a female version of Harry's angry face.&nbsp; Both sides have faint freckles on the cheeks.&nbsp; Her hair is definitly the high point of this figure, I just whish it was available in more colors (it would look great in Luna's shade of blonde which will be discussed later).&nbsp; She carries a brown wand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luna Lovegood:</strong></p>
<p>The rightful star of the set who I am sure LEGO will keep exclusive to the Hogwarts express (though maybe she'll come in the new <em>Battle of Hogwarts</em>).&nbsp; She has blonde hair in the mold of Agent Trace's, which comes of frequently.&nbsp; The hair isn't in the classic color used for blond and blonde, it is classified as Cool Yellow, and is lighter and brighter than classic yellow.&nbsp; Like all of the characters in the set, she has a double face: A smile and a austounded look with her eyes covered by her spectrospecs.&nbsp; Her torso is a pink jacket with a little bit of a purple shirt showing underneath.&nbsp; Her legs have a skirt with various random objects like stars, horses, and birds dangling from it.&nbsp; The skirt is printed on blue legs, most likely representing jeans.&nbsp; She has yet another brown wand and a copy of <em>The Quibbler </em>headlined <strong>Harry Potter Speaks Out at Last!</strong>&nbsp; What is kind of funny about the magazine is that Harry seems to have his GbltOfFr in the image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Draco Malfoy:</strong></p>
<p>He has a new swept back hair piece in blond, a double face (smirk and bewildered), an exclusive Slytherin robe (not counting a magnet set), black legs, a copy of <em>The Daily Prophet, </em>and a black wand.&nbsp; One thing strange about his torso is that it has a little snake pin on the tie when the Gryffindor tie has no pin.&nbsp; Some have complained about his eyebrows not matching his hair color.&nbsp; I looked it up, and they actually don't.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>I don't remember building it.&nbsp; I think it took me about two hours, the total time it took me to build <em>The Burrow</em> and <em>Hagrid's Hut</em>.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Great actually, I see&nbsp;a lot of possible playability.&nbsp; On the car however, it bugs me how&nbsp;Harry and Ron flop around and that there is no space for Hedwig who is included in the set.&nbsp;The train uses diesel wheels rather than those for a steam engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Farewell</h4>
<p>Farewell!</p>

"MattieG7","2011-06-09T16:50:40.423Z","All aboard the Hogwarts Express!","<p>I got this set in Xmas '10, not expecting any LHP sets. But when I opened it, I could not believe my eyes. I had a Hogwarts Express! :D It has many good points, and very few bad points, which I will explain now.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions - 9/10</h4><p>I really like the design of the new boxes, and the 2 instruction booklets were easy to follow, giving you clear and simple steps.</p>
<h4>Parts - 9/10</h4><p>Being the Hogwarts express, it has filled up my red brick collection a fair amount, and the invisibility cloak is a nice touch, but it's a bit awkward when it's placed on a minifigure. I now have a frog, a lot of owls and about 10 spiders now, because I have some of the other 2010 ones aswell :P</p>
<h4>Minifigures - 8.8/10</h4><p><b>Harry Potter - 7/10</b></p><p>Well, it wasn't a big shock to get him. It obviously needed him in the set, but I've got a lot of him now.</p><p><b>Ron Weasley - 10/10</b></p><p>I love the new Ron figure! His hair is just so awesome, I cannot get over it! His face is awesome aswell, with the scared face on the back, because when Harry, Hermione and Ginny are angry, he's scared! :D</p><p><b>Ginny Weasley - 9/10</b></p><p>The last Ginny minifigure was in 2002 in the Chamber of Secrets set, and to be honest, it didn't look anything like her. But the new one is just too awesome to put into words. It's always nice to have another Gryffindor uniform, and her hair is fantastic, it really looks like her!</p><p><b>Draco Malfoy - 8/10</b></p><p>The new Draco is pretty cool, I'm loving the new hairpiece, but I can't help thinking his smirking face doesn't really look like him, so I put the 5378 head on him instead, and it looks OK now. But if I want him to look slightly worried, I use the worried face on the back on the new head.</p><p><b>Luna Lovegood - 10/10</b></p><p>Three words: Oh My God. This is a crazily awesome minifigure. The hair is great, the face really looks like her, with her Specterspecs on the back, and I love the torso, and the skirt print on the legs</p>
<h4>The build - 9/10</h4><p>It was a very fun build, and there wasn't any repetitive bits on it, seeing as there was only 1 carriage. I can't remember how long it took me to build, but I can estimate between 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
<h4>The completed model - 8/10</h4><p>The locomotive is a stunning one, with intricate details on the driver's bit. The tender is cool, with a space to store the students' belongings. But as we come to the carriage, which is OK, I find myself slightly disappointed. The exterior of it is alright, but the interior looks hardly anything like it. There is no corridor leading to each compartment, just 4 seats with a goblet and some white thing in the middle. In order for the corridor to fit in, it would have to be more than 6 studs wide, but I can't really imagine a wide train like that. Anyway, I'm not so angry with it, LEGO Harry Potter's LEGO Harry Potter at the end of the day :)</p><p></p><h4 style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 1.1em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; "">Overall - 43.8/50 = 8.76/10</h4><p></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, it is an awesome set, with cool minifigures, locomotive, tender and carriage. I know I had a little rant over the carriage, but I can tolerate it :D</p><p><br></p><p>I hope my review came in handy if you was contemplating buying it :D</p><p><br></p><p>Matt</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The train looks very similar to the one in the movies.</li><li>-The playability in this set is very awe-striking.</li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The stickers here are limited, but are, as always, such a hassle.</li><li>-The train is not on scale.</li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a truly excellent set, and is a great remake of the original set. I extremely recommend this set to all Harry Potter fans of the world.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Konstantin","2012-04-01T00:55:01.913Z","The Great Train ""Hogwarts Express""","&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I like this set very much. I bought it in K mart for $5.There is a big red train called the ""Hogwarts Express"". The locomotive is very detailed with printed front part,tube through which the smoke comes out,and driver's cabin.Inside the driver's cabin are detailed controls.<div>There is a compartment that opens and you can see the engine with the coal inside.The locomotive is 24 studs long.</div><div><br></div><div>After locomotive is the baggage wagon. It is 10 studs long. The top of it opens and you can put suitcases and various stuff inside.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>After it is the main wagon where the people are. This wagon is 24 studs long;it provides sitting space for 4 people at small tables, and standing space for two more at the sides.I like the transparent windows of this wagon. The roof can be opened but it holds together tightly enough to resist the force of gravity when turned upside down. All these wagons are linked together with magnetic pieces.There are some stickers but they did not cause any problem for me.If one treats his stickers well (by carefully placing them in their proper positions) , they will treat you well also.</div><div><br></div><div>There is also a light blue car that is from the 1960's.It has opening doors,detailed interior with steering wheel and control stick,and opening baggage at rear side and you could put stuff in it.</div><div><br></div><div>The set also includes a popcorn cart; treasure chest with 2 rare transparent magic wands and 2 rubies,2 diamonds; 5 LEGO people (Harry Potter and his friends) ; and there are bonus animals which are: 3 owls (I like the prints on them), black spider,and a gray rat.The set also includes a cloth that makes people ""invisible"" and a lot of spare sticks. The popcorn cart, treasure chest, and 4 people can fit in the big wagon.One LEGO person can be the driver of the locomotive.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a very great and detailed model with rare pieces. It is available at K mart or Toys R us.<br><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
