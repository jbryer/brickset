"Yope","2010-09-16T11:24:58.723Z","Sorting hats off to LEGO!","Howdy! If, a month ago, someone had asked me what my favourite LEGO set was it would have been like choosing between my parents. I probably would have cried and ran away. Fortunately there is now a set that blows all of the others out of the water! This is awesome, truly excellent. I mean it is easily the best Hogwarts LEGO have ever made, the details, the variety between the builldings, the fun to have re-acting your favourite parts, Flitwick... The list goes on and on. Only downside - the other Hogwarts Castles LEGO have made were all RRP £79.99 but now this is £20 more. That certainly warrants a sad face- :(. No matter, if you have even the slightest liking for Harry Potter then this is the set for you! Hope you enjoyed this and thanks for reading.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,4

"Greyface","2010-10-10T15:05:42.607Z","Magic Far Greater Than Anything We Do Here","<p>That's what I thought when I bought this set. (The line is Dumbledore's about music for the un-geeky fan, but it applies here I think.) This set is easily my favorite set ever. I have been a lifelong Potter fan and have read the entire series about 15 times, but this (along with Freeing Dobby) was my very first Harry Potter set. I pre-ordered it, and it was on backorder, but I finally got it. So, without further ado, I shall dissect it for you.</p>
<h4>Minifigs and Characters</h4>
<p>This set comes with eight human minifigures, one non-playable minifigure, two&nbsp;Dementors, two paintings and a&nbsp;head in the fire,&nbsp;one cat, three owls, and a toad.</p>
<p><strong>The Humans: </strong>Harry and Hermione have been perfected from the Order of the Phoenix set and look fantastic. Dumbledore looks great too with his new golden glasses, but the flipside of his head looks&nbsp;angry and quite odd. I always picture Dumbledore with purple robes and a cape, so the blue robes disappoints me, but I guess it's okay. McGonagall looks exactly like McGonagall, though her incredibly-accurate eyebrows are all but nonexistent when you put on her wizard's hat. Flitwick and Snape looks amazing, I quite like the new hair for Snape, and Argus Filch is great, even if I did like the promotional brown hair better. </p>
<p>The only complaint is that Filch's and Flitwick's additions stole away Ron, Hagrid, and Malfoy from the set. The set feels incomplete without Ron, of course, and Malfoy, since you have to buy the other sets to occupy the Slytherin common room. The set designers again forget Professor Sprout as well, as she is the only Head of House not in the set. I hope that there will be a second wave of sets in 2011 with Sprout and maybe even Professor Slughorn.</p>
<p><strong>The Non-Playable Minifigure:</strong> the Suit of Armor is fantastic! It is far a step-up from the stupid legless knight from the previous Hogwarts.</p>
<p><strong>The Dementors:</strong> These redesigned Dementors are fantastic. Thank goodness LEGO realized that Dementors aren't green, and that their capes are black! However, the capes don't really fit on the Dementors, and you have to awkwardly tuck them in. The best thing about these guys though are the reversible heads, which allow you to use the Dementor's Kiss on somebody.</p>
<p><strong>The 2-D Characters:</strong> the paintings under Dumbledore's office are great, I believe the desired effect is looking at the portraits as one walks into the office. Sirius's head in the fire is, however, a disappointment, as he doesn't look anything like Sirius.</p>
<p><strong>The Animals:</strong> these guys are fantastic. Mrs. Norris is printed and wonderful, as are the new owls. These include the majestic Hedwig, a gray owl I'm going to pretend is Errol, the Weasley's aged owl, and a brown school owl. There is also a toad in Dumbledore's office.</p>
<h4>Room by Room</h4>
<p>We'll start with the Room of Requirement. This is a great little room, the Room of Hidden Things, even if it has nothing but the fantastic Vanishing Cabinet, which matches with the one in Borgin and Burkes in the upcoming Diagon Alley. Above it is the restricted section of the library. You have to take off the handcuffs to access the books, so it's a little weird, but it looks great and it's a great thought. The Astronomy Tower is fine, except the telescope seems like an afterthought and the continuity is messed up since this isn't the tallest tower in the set. In addition, the tower doesn't resemble the depiction in the Half-Blood Prince.</p>
<p>In the next tower, the bottom is Slytherin Common Room, with snakes, a Slytherin plate, two chairs and a table. No complaints, just a suggestion: no Slytherin would read the Quibbler, and I'm not sure Dumbledore would examine the Daily Prophet, so switch the two's location. Above this room is a hallway with a spider and a rotating Suit of Armor with Tom Riddle's Diary in the back. Again, no complaints. Above it we find the Gryffindor Common Room, which features a fireplace and two chairs and a table. The fire can move to reveal Sirius's head, discussed above. Above it is a fantastic owlery, complete with bird droppings!</p>
<p>Next we happen upon the Great Hall, which loooks fantastic with the new windows and the new roof! The tables are great, with a Gryffindor and Slythering table. The food includes a croissant, green and red cherries, a full turkey, a cake or pudding with yellow ice cream on top, and six golden goblets. The only complaint with this is that the pudding does not allow easy seating, meaning if you get Ron and Ginny from another set they will not all be able to sit right next to each other. The Staff Table, or lack thereof, is terrible as well. First off, there aren't enough seats. With four teachers and many more that they have released in the other sets/over the years, two seats and a podium (the Headmaster's Chair is nowhere to be found!) is simply not enough. Indeed, McGonagall cannot sit, Dumbledore must stand at the podium, Flitwick looks awkward sitting, and you must remove Snape's cape to allow him to sit. Furthermore, there is no table! It seems that the two chairs are simply there to sit in. However, the positives far outweigh the inconveniences brought up by the staff section in the Great Hall.</p>
<p>Next we come upon the tower with Dumbledore's Office. The first floor is a small Trophy Room, though it has few trophies (combine this with the previous Hogwart's trophy room and you have gold.) It comes with a James Potter: Seeker shield, two golden goblets, a ruby, and a scroll with a dragon on it and an ominous message: <em>""You are far more powerful than you would ever imagine...""</em> Next we go up a moving staircase, complete with ex-Headmaster portraits, up to Dumbledore's Office. <SPAN class=star-rating-control jQuery1286734551665=""40"">As far as disappointments for this room, there are few: the potions cabinets are perfect, complete with hidden letter and basilisk fang, and the desk and chair are excellent.&nbsp;My only complaints are that there is little standing room for other characters and that&nbsp;Fawkes is absent. This leads you to wonder whether the display on Dumbledore's desk is the Pensieve or an ode to Fawkes. Either way, it leaves you wanting the other in the set. Above the office is a spire housing Gryffindor's Sword and the Sorting Hat, sitting majestically and looking down upon the office. On either side of the Sorting Hat is a small roof section with standing room for the characters.</SPAN></p>
<h4><SPAN class=star-rating-control jQuery1286734551665=""40""></SPAN>Building Experience</h4>
<p>The build was long and filled with fun, but a little repititious and tedious at times. Seeing Hogwarts come alive in your hands is great fun, but building window after window, wall after wall can get old. The Great Hall was tedious to build, but most of the set was pure magic to build. Thus, I awarded Hogwart's <LABEL class="""" jQuery1286734551665=""99"">Building Experience four bricks.</LABEL></p>
<h4><SPAN class=star-rating-control jQuery1286734551665=""40"">Parts</SPAN></h4>
<p><SPAN class=star-rating-control jQuery1286734551665=""40"">I have a lot of LEGO's, being a life-long fan, but many MOCers might scoff at my collection. Obviously, the 1290-piece set excited me in more than one way.&nbsp;So I will list off here the many exciting pieces in the set: the books, Mrs. Norris, the toad, the food (which includes a full turkey, ice cream which goes on top of a pudding, and a croissant), many turrets anda James Potter (Seeker) shield, to name a few. Some pieces any Harry Potter fan will get excited for are the banners and plates for Gryffindor and Slytherin, the Quibbler, the Daily Prophet, the Firebolt, the Marauder's Map, Gryffindor's Sword, a suit of armor&nbsp;and the Swording Hat. The only complaints here are that the books are all one color (brown) and they have no pages or content, and that Fawkes isn't included (or is the Pensieve not included? But I repeat myself.)</SPAN></p>
<h4><SPAN class=star-rating-control jQuery1286734551665=""40"">Playability</SPAN></h4>
<p><SPAN class=star-rating-control jQuery1286734551665=""40"">This is truly where the set's magic begins to kick in: with 11 minifigures (though the exceptional suit of armor shouldn't really count), there are thousands of fun times you can have with this set, especially with the new Flitwick and Filch&nbsp;minifigures and the redesigned McGonagall and Dementors. The great thing about this set as well is that they seem to have gone away from the ""let's find things around the castle"" theme that they had in the terrible Order of the Phoenix version of the Castle and have just depicted as many rooms as possible. However, Ron is sorely missed from the set, as are, strangely, Hagrid and Malfoy.</SPAN></p>
<h4><SPAN class=star-rating-control jQuery1286734551665=""40"">Value for Money</SPAN></h4>
<p><SPAN class=star-rating-control jQuery1286734551665=""40"">At $130 USA, this set is pricey. In fact, it while be the most expensive until the release of Diagon Alley. This pricetag may cause some to hesitate, but whether you're new, like me, to the world of Potter LEGO's, or you're just adding onto your Castle, this set is worth every dollar. In addition, there is an old trick many fans use, which is dividing the piece count by 10 to determine the price it should be. With 1290 pieces, simple math says the price should be $129 USA. That's just a dollar off, so I don't really see people's argument that these sets are being marked-up because of Warner Bros. They're not.</p></SPAN>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"SuperChris","2010-10-12T07:29:25.37Z","4th time lucky!","<h4>Introduction</h4>4 Hogwarts Castles later, we've been treated to one of the best Harry Potter sets ever. And I honestly mean that. This is a fantastic set, and everything a Harry Potter fan could want from a Lego set.<div><br></div><div>The set includes over 1000 pieces, which makes it the biggest Harry Potter set to date (until next January), it costs £99.99 over here in the UK, so it's also the most expensive Harry Potter set, I think. In fact, I think it's the second, because the motorised Hogwarts Express was more than £100, right?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Figures</h4><div>We'll start with the figures. You get 10, including two Dementors. All these figures are great, and most are exclusive to this set, (Flitch, Flitwich, Dumbledore, etc). TLG did a great job with the figures, and these are some of the best Potter figures ever. My only grip is Harry's face is a little babyish, but I can go with it. <a href=""http://chrissramblings.com/2010/09/02/lego-harry-potter-2010-sets/dsc00459/"">You can see it here.</a></div><div><br></div><h4>The Castle (Outside)</h4><div>The outside of the castle looks amazing, and very detailed as well. I looks so much better than the 3rd version, and doesn't have huge holes in the walls like the first version. The only problem is this Castle is a lot smaller than the others, and when you put them together, it looks very out of place. This seems a shame, but don't let it put you off buying it. <a href=""http://chrissramblings.com/2010/10/05/adventures-at-hogwarts-castle/p1060574/"">You can see the outside of the castle here</a>&nbsp;or <a href=""http://chrissramblings.com/2010/10/05/adventures-at-hogwarts-castle/p1060577/"">here.</a></div><div><br></div><h4>The Castle (Inside)</h4><div>Like the outside of the castle, the inside is also amazingly detailed. You get all sorts of great pieces, to fill up the rooms and whatnot. The rooms are a bit small, but it's very charming, if you get me? Dumbledore's office includes a printed sorting hat and the sword from Chamber of Secrets. There is also 3 printed owls at the top of one of the towers, and these all look great! I'm so glad Lego gave us printed owls. We also get a printed cat, but not a printed rat. It's not a big problem, but it would of been nice.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The great hall is also great. You get a huge cake (which is too big to fit on the table) and other foods, it's great.

You get 10 bags of Lego and the build is split into 4 parts, for each section of the castle. It's not difficult, but it's not repetitive either, which is always good.</div><div><br></div><h4>Summary</h4><div>Like Harry Potter? Buy this set. Simple.

"birgoyle","2010-10-27T08:52:49.213Z","At long last...","<p>What can I say? After nine years of sub-par Hogwarts renderings, Lego have finally created a set that I would be proud to display without modifications. <br />
<br />
The details and design put into this set are fantastic, and this is by far the best castle (Harry Potter or otherwise) Lego have created. They have gone to painstaking lengths to create a minifig / play friendly cut out of Hogwarts.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The minifigs speak for themselves - very detailed, and very exclusive. Although new versions, McGonagall was only available in Dumbledore's Office from CoS; Voldemort in the Graveyard Duel (GoF), while Flitwick and Filch have never made a lego appearance before. The updated Dementors (while annoying if you have multiples from PoA) are a good update - though much the same. Dumbledore is new - I love the added touch of 2 faces; one with glasses and the other without. The new Snape fig is just about the only other fig that the new Dastan (from Prince of Persia) hairpiece suits; other than Dastan himself. <br />
<br />
The castle is very &quot;cute&quot; - from left to right:-<br />
An updated Dumbledore's office, complete with Wizard portrait stickers, trophy room and Sorting Hat.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then the Great Hall, a vast improvement on the old version. The details and accessories in the Hall almost make up for the price alone. The pieces used for the walls and windows are great. <br />
<br />
Then there's the Grand Staircase tower (although missing an actual staircase), which instead has the Slytherin Common Room on the lower floor, the Knight in the middle, and the Gryffindor Common Room on the top floor, complete with fireplace (and Sirius' face in the fire). While not the best size or shape, this tower looks brilliant from the outside. <br />
<br />
Lastly there is a small version of the West Tower (which sadly was removed from the actual castle layout in the 6th film). This has the Vanishing Cabinet on the ground floor, restricted section of the Library in the middle, and the exterior top floor has a Telescope. <br />
<br />
When combined together, they form a very basic silhouette of the actual Hogwarts Castle. <br />
<br />
While this set doesn't answer my prayers for a &quot;UCS Hogwarts&quot; it certainly outdoes the rest of the Harry Potter lego by far. <br />
<br />
<b>Pros</b>:</p>

    <li>Grand Staircase tower is missing a staircase</li>
    <li>I know they're expected - but the stickers :-(</li>
    <li>Over-all size</li>

After the most recent (and disappointing) Hogwarts castle, I feared I would see no more of the boy wizard. Not so. The newest rendition of Hogwarts, though not perfect, is probably the best.

The first is the Slytherin common room, which contains two chairs, a table, goblet, and newspaper. The second room has a knight which can be turned around to reveal a book. The third room belongs to Gryffindor, and has two chairs, a table, another goblet, and the marauder's map. There is also a fireplace with Sirius Black face. The final room is an owl housing.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The Great Hall is the largest tower, and is comprised of a multitude of details.

The final piece of Hogwarts is Dumbledore's office. The first floor has a chest with a diamond and scripture inside. There is also a trophy plaque honoring James Potter. The staircase then leads to Dumbledore's abode. Inside is a chair and a table, which has a crystal ball on it. There are also two shelves containing potions. Plus, the sorting hat and sword of Gryffindor top it off. My one complaint would be that the playability functions could have been much more detailed and interesting.

 printed on the front, but not the back.&nbsp; On his legs a belt and a ring 
of keys are printed near the top and on the front of his torso a jacket with vest, 
shirt, and tie is printed.&nbsp; His facial expression is a scowl and he 
looks distinctly unfriendly.&nbsp; Finally, he has a long grey hair piece 
(the some one as Dumbledore).&nbsp; Concerning Mrs. Norris, she is small and 
brownish.&nbsp; There is a printed face, but otherwise there is nothing I find terribly distinctive.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Professor Filius Flitwick:</p><p>Like Filch, this figure is completely exclusive to this set.&nbsp; A suit is printed on the front of his torso with a jacket, vest, shirt, and tie.&nbsp; His legs are rather special, they are shortened to reflect the characters particularly short stature and my first reaction to seeing them was that they are cute.&nbsp; His face is printed in a neutral expression and wearing glasses and a mustache.&nbsp; There is nothing special about his hairpiece.&nbsp; He comes with a brown wand, the same as Hermione's.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Professor Minerva McGonagall</span>:</p><p>This is only the second set with Professor McGonagall.&nbsp; This version has a dark green colour scheme, which is a great improvement over the bright green previously used.&nbsp; Her torso and dress piece are printed on the front with great detail.&nbsp; Her expression is wry, as if she knows a secret or is up to something.&nbsp; The only accessory she comes with is a matching green hat.&nbsp; My only complaint here is that she does not come with a wand while all the other characters who are capable of magic have one.&nbsp; I'm not sure why a wand was not included, but I think it was a poor decision.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Harry Potter:</p><p>Harry has the same torso, legs, and wand as Hermione.&nbsp; His face is double printed as well - one happy expression, and one angry expression, both sides have his scar of course.&nbsp; He has the familiar hair piece, but comes with his broom as well as an invisibility cloak, which was a nice surprise.&nbsp; Both accessories are excellent.<br></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Dementors:</p><p>These are an impressive improvement over the previous version.&nbsp; They are now appropriately coloured in grey and black and they have nothing printed on their faces except gaping mouths.&nbsp; They are placed on clear platforms to give the impression of floating and to provide stability.&nbsp; This was a much needed improvement.&nbsp; Their cloaks are better as well.&nbsp; One tip I have for those assembling these figures is to ensure the darker and fuzzier side is outward, if it is not, the cloaks will not rest properly on the dementors.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Knight:</p><p>This suit of armour is better than the previous one.&nbsp; He has a chest plate, a helmet, and a sword.&nbsp; However, his helmet does not match the sword and chest plate in hue.&nbsp; The helmet is a metallic silver, while the chest plate and sword are brushed silver.&nbsp; Despite that, he looks good when positioned in the castle.<br></p>

<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is enjoyable and takes a decent length of time.&nbsp; It is not overly repetitive or overly difficult.&nbsp; I found it to be even easier thanks to numbered bags and different instruction manuals.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is quite large and is ideal for play given its size and design.&nbsp; While some people dislike the arrangement of the individual buildings, this can be easily modified given their method of attachment or kept separate entirely.</p><p>I am most pleased with the great hall.&nbsp; It is large and wonderfully designed with stained glass windows, an abundance of regular windows, a chandelier, two house tables laden with food, Dumbledore's podium, and two staff chairs.&nbsp; Yes, it could have been bigger to include the two additional tables and more chairs for the staff, but I think it unnecessary.&nbsp; Lego has not to my knowledge produced many Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw figures and house tables for them would not make sense as a result.</p><p>The astronomy tower contains the room or requirement on the bottom, the library in the middle, and a telescope on the roof.&nbsp; As for the structure of the tower itself, I think it is reasonably representative of a castle tower and there are two torches with flames on the inside.&nbsp; The room of requirement solely consists of a sort of cupboard which I think is supposed to be the entrance.&nbsp; I don't think this is a negative aspect of the model because this is all that is needed.&nbsp; You can place a character, perhaps two, inside and pretend that they are in the room of requirement.&nbsp; If you're really gung-ho about it, then you can build a separate room with the rest of your collection and pretend your figures are transported there.&nbsp; The library is something that I am not happy with.&nbsp; It contains three books and one book case.&nbsp; While the handcuffs and keys seem to work well (the glass slides aside well), I wish it was a larger room.&nbsp; But perhaps it is just meant to be the restricted section...As for the telescope, I love it.&nbsp; It is cleverly constructed and is movable to simulate an astronomy class.&nbsp; You also get a rat to put up here, but that is just a little extra.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next is the tower with the common rooms and the owlery.&nbsp; It has a proper tower roof and a little decorative branch off the side.&nbsp; On the bottom you have the Slytherin common room.&nbsp; It has a Slytherin crest, two green snakes, a torch, two chairs, and a table with the Quibbler and a glass.&nbsp; It is a little small, but at least it is properly situated in the basement area.&nbsp; Above that is a room with the suit of armour.&nbsp; Turn the knight around and there is a black book which I assume is Tom Riddle's Diary.&nbsp; There is also a spider included for this room.&nbsp; Above this is the Gryfindor common room.&nbsp; It is a little larger than the Slytherin one and has a few differences: there are no snakes, instead of the Quibbler you get the Marauders' Map, and there is a full fire place!&nbsp; The fire place has Sirius inside it and he can be pushed in and out of sight to replicate those scenes in the movie when his head appears in the fire.&nbsp; The last room in this section is the owlery.&nbsp; Here you get three wonderful new owls with detailed printing.&nbsp; There are also little white round pieces to represent owl droppings.<br></p><p>The final building contains the trophy room and Dumbledore's office.&nbsp; The trophy room is on the bottom and is a little spartan.&nbsp; It does contain James Potter's seeker trophy, two gold goblets, and a treasure chest.&nbsp; I suppose if you want more trophys you could purchase the new Quidditch set and use those if they fit.&nbsp; My biggest complaint here is the small size of the room.&nbsp; It has very little playability as a result.&nbsp; There are stairs that lead up to Dumbledore's office.&nbsp; Dumbledore's office is one of my favourite rooms (though I would be hard-pressed to choose between it and the great hall).&nbsp; There is a large chair behind a desk on which there is a copy of the Daily Prophet under a magnifying glass and a crystal ball with an orange cone inside.&nbsp; To either side there is a piece of furniture with simulated drawers, various containers, and on the one on the right, a frog.&nbsp; If these are opened, inside one is a basilisk fang and in the other a letter.&nbsp; This room is of good size, but it would be better if there were more room for figures to stand in front of the desk.&nbsp; At the top of the room there is what appears to be a storage area and this contains the sorting hat (which is a brown printed version of a wizard hat) and the sword of Gryfindor.<br></p><p></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, I highly recommend this set if you like Harry Potter.&nbsp; It is the best castle from the theme so far and contains delightful little details that will thrill any Potter fan.&nbsp; Children will love this set for its playability and figures and older fans will enjoy this as well, in addition to the details and display value this set provides.&nbsp; And as I said, if you dislike the configuration provided in the instructions, it is a simple matter to rearrange the buildings or separate them altogether, so that isn't a real con.&nbsp; It is a bit pricey, but considering that it is a licensed theme and that it includes many special pieces and minifigures, I think it is worth the expense.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

This set is NOT better than the old set's, the old set's are UNIQUE, they are MAGICAL, they have this old, classic and beautiful feel to them. THE Great Hall is NO WHERE NEAR as good as the Original Great Hall, it's smaller and isn't as magical or enchanting.

"Caramel","2011-08-12T19:24:44.357Z","The magic returns","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I got into harry potter the year this set came out and it was my first set in the HP series. The set has four main parts to the building with their own special features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1: The figs. I was really pleased with&nbsp;the figures&nbsp;that came with the set except for the fact of the exclusion of ron weasly. The harry and hermione were good but i now have multiple. The new version of mcgonagal and dumbeldore have more detailed printing then before which is an improvement. The new&nbsp;Voldemort has much more accurate head print and robes then the one from Graveyard Duel. I'm glad lego finnaly realised dementors are grey with black robes not green with grey robes. The new snape looks alot better then the old ones.&nbsp;The set also comes with new figs Proffesor Flitwick and Filch</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2: The north tower. This tower contains three rooms. The astronomy tower is basically a walled area with a telescope, which could use much more to make it look better. The restricted section has a locked case that countains three books, one key is in the lock the other is with filch. The Room of requirement is a large-ish room that holds the vanishing cabnit which is really good looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3: The main tower.&nbsp;It has&nbsp;four small rooms. The owlrey has two stands for owls and white studs on the ground which&nbsp;I presume are bird poop. The inclusion of this room cofuses me since in the movies the owlrey is a seperate building from hogwarts. The gryffindor common room has a fire place with sirius black's face in it, a table and two chairs, the only flaw is it's lack of fig space. In the room with the knight which rotates has tom riddles diary behind it. The slytherin common room has a table and two chairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4: The Great Hall. It has two house tables, one for gryffindor one for slytherin and dumbeldores table. There is a turkey, a cake and a bowl of cherries and cresants. It would have been better if it included the staff table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5: The east tower. It is the smallest tower and has two rooms. The trophy room has a stand with trophies and a shield award for james potter, it also has stairs leading to the headmasters office. Dumbeldores office contains and table and chair along with potion shelves. The table has a magnifying glass, a crystal ball and a daily prophet. The potion shelves hide a letter and the basilisk fang.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you get the chance and money i recommend you try and get this set if you collect harry potter or want some rare pieces.</p>

"LegoC10","2011-10-20T17:46:45.4Z","What a set!","<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: small; "">To start off with this review I must say, this said is amazing. Lego has made four Hogwarts Castles since Lego Harry Potter was first released. This Hogwarts is definitely, in my opinion, the best. To begin, I will start at the building process.&nbsp;<br><br>The set took me approximately 3-4 hours to build, and I consider myself a speed-builder. Unfortunately, the amount of time it took me was partially because of the amount of stickers. There were lots of them. Some of them were easy to put on, but others-like the walls-gave you a tiny space to fit the sticker on without going to the outside of the brick. Other than stickers the set was very much enjoyable to build. Until the end of the paragraph I will state which pieces have sticker, and which are printed. Stickers include the following: two pictures on the wall in the trophy room; a plaque in gold saying ""Seeker [fancy line] James Potter;"" a Slytherin banner in the Great Hall' a Griffindor banner in the Great Hall; a 2x2 Slytherin piece in their Common Room; a small Griffindor flag in their Common Room; Sirius Black's head in the fireplace in Griffindor Common Room; and eight wall piece stickers. There are also many printed bricks that already have something on them and need no sticker. They include (but NOT counting minifigures): the Sorting Hat; Daily Prophet newspaper (you can actually read what it says! It says about the mass breakout from Azkaban.); a Hogwarts Acceptance Letter; a scroll with a dragon on it and a sentence saying, ""You are far more powerful than you would ever imagine...;"" The Quibbler newspaper talking about Harry speaking about Voldemort's return; and the Marauder's Map.&nbsp;<br><br>Ok, next are the minifigures and animals. The best to start with should be Harry Potter. I don't think he has changed at all since 2007, but I will describe him anyways. Brown wand. Black pants. Griffindor robe, with printed back. Black, untidy looking hair that has been used for many people in the past. His head is double-sided (Reminds me of Quirrel! :) ). One side shows him with a nice smile on. His glasses and orange-colored scar are clearly visible. On the other side he is almost the same except frowning and with furrowed eyebrows. He looks like he's concentrating really hard, like he's dueling, thankfully, not like he's mad. Harry also comes with his Firebolt broomstick which is a black broomstick with a small silver cone block. Harry can hold on to the broom and arrange him in a way that actually looks like he is sitting on it, and holding on! Harry also includes his invisibility cloak which is really cool and glittery, but does not turn the minifigure invisible. With the extra pieces at the end, I built a make-shift hanger for it. Overall, a great minifigure and looks like the real Harry (or as much as a lego can look like the original).&nbsp;<br>Next is Hermione Granger. Let me just say, Lego has never been able to make the minifigure actually look like her. Same clothes as Harry and same wand, with printed back. Her hair is...hard to explain, but actually DOES look like her's in the movie. Her face, on the other hand, does not. She also has a double-sided face. One side she's happy, and her lips look like they have lipstick on, but not pink. That was Lego's first mistake with her. The other side she actually does look mad, and with those same lips. A good minifigure, but not like the real Hermione from the movies.&nbsp;<br>Minerva McGonagall is also here. She does not have a wand. She has a detailed green dress that looks good, but makes her have no legs. She also has a green cape, which are very hard to come by. Her face is detailed, and looks relatively like McGonagall's. She also has a green wizard hat. A good minifigure to have in your collection.&nbsp;<br>Filius Flitwick is introduced for the first time in this set. This Charms teacher has a wand (that's almost as tall as him), short, black legs, a suit that I think is new, a face with a bushy, brown mustache, glasses, and brown hair that is not new, but not found that often.&nbsp;<br>Snape is here and completely remodeled! Black pants. Black wand. New black suit. Black cape. Awesome black hair that has only been found for Dastan in Prince of Persia, but this time it's black. This time they finally got the hair perfect. In the past they've used girl hair, which didn't look good. This hair looks 99% like the hair in the movie. His face is also the best they've done. In the past they used a glow-in-the-dark face (Why???) and, although it was cool to have a glow-in-the-dark head, this one is more real. The only problem is that he doesn't look as mean as he's supposed to, but a great minifigure, none the same.&nbsp;<br>Argus Filch also makes his debut appearance. He has printed legs! There are keys on them and a belt. He also has a cool grey suit. His face is cool, with facial hair, furrowed eyebrows and a grimace, that looks like him a lot. But, just like Lego Harry Potter the videogame, they gave him grey hair, when he actually has brown hair. Oh well, he looks awesome, all the same. He also carries a lantern and has his cat, Mrs. Norris, well...it might be Crookshanks. The cat has a printed face.&nbsp;<br>The Dementors (2x). They have also been remodeled. This time their skeleton bodies are grey, instead of green. Their bodies are just like a skeleton, except an exclusive grey color. The arms are also like skeletons and the same grey color. In the movies they have no legs, they hover. Lego was apparently unable to make these minifigures float, so they went with the next best thing: a stick! This is that same grey color, and connects to the body like a skeleton's legs do. The two joint-connectors lead down into a pole with a stud at the bottom to allow standing. Sure this looks nothing like a real Dementor, but it is still awesomely cool! A clear circular base was Lego's only attempt at making it look like hovering. The pole is thin enough for a minifigure to grab onto. This pole holds potential to do millions of things. The cloak of the dementor is new looking, black, felt-feeling, and looks cool. The only problem with this is that the cloak will try and fly up, so you have to stop it with the arms. The actual head can show little detail, but good enough, not just a grey head, or show the same, but with the mouth gaping open. No eyes. A black hood accompanies the head. This minifigure could not be better, in my opinion. A double-sided head is just an added bonus! And there are two of them!&nbsp;<br>Dumbledore is back! His clothes are a baby-bluish color. His suit is very detailed, a pity his beard covers it all up! The back of his torso is also printed and detailed. His beard is grey and just like so many others have been. He has Filch's same grey hair, as well. And, guess what, he has a double sided head! One side is him happy and no glasses (mouth included, even though the beard hides it), and the other side shows his serious with his half-moon spectacles. Make sure you keep his beard on, because the head looks nothing like him without it. This head could also possibly be used to make a Cornelius Fudge. He also includes his light tan-colored wand. This minifigure looks just like him, except his suit gives the appearance that he's wearing pajamas. I wish he was wearing his purple suit and cape, but, oh well, he's still cool.&nbsp;<br>And last, but not least, Volde--sorry--He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. This is the second time that You-Know-Who has Apparated into a set, the first being the Graveyard Duel, but then he just looked like a ghost. This time he looks like himself. He has black clothes, but with green lines, that make it look better. He also has a black cape. He is carrying his white wand. His hands and face are white. Typically, he has no hair or hat. They did as good as they could do with his head, and I must say it's pretty sweet. Ironically, he has his nose-slits, making him the first lego to ever have a nose! The irony is that in the movies, Voldemort has no nose, just slits, and Lego decided to give him the first nose! Great minifigure.&nbsp;<br>There are also many animals in this set. There is a bat, a spider, a green toad (possibly Trevor), a roasted chicken (which is only in this set and Medieval Village), two green snakes in the Slytherin Common Room, a grey rat (possibly Scabbers or just a normal rat), Mrs. Norris or Crookshanks, which I mentioned earlier, and three owls. The owls are each exclusive and different from each other. Each owl is exclusively printed, with visible, colored feathers, beak, and eyes. There is a brown owl (possibly Pigwigeon), a grey owl, and Hedwig.&nbsp;<br><br>There are also many artifact from the movies spread throughout. (WARNING! Some artifacts might be repeated from earlier paragraphs! WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTS!) In Dumbledore's Office there is the Basilisk fang, and Harry's Acceptance Letter in a hidden cabinet underneath two shelves with potions. The Daily Prophet sits on Dumbledore's desk. There is also a crystal ball on the same desk, which is odd, because Dumbledore hates the subject of Divination. The Sorting Hat is above, and directly below it is the Sword of Godric Griffindor. On the front of the castle, a 2x2 square tile shows the Hogwarts' Crest and Houses. Down the spiral staircase to the next floor, the Trophy Room, two House Cups/Quidditch cups sit on a podium with the James Potter--Seeker plaque. In the Great Hall, a Treacle Treat cake sits on the table. A golden bowl containing green and red cherries and a croissant can be used as a Pensieve. The Quibbler sits in Slytherin's Common Room. A suit of armor can spin around to reveal Tom Riddle's Diary. The Firebolt, Invisibility Cloak, and Marauder's Map belong to Harry. The animals were all mentioned above. Sirius' head in the fire is kind of an artifact. The Vanishing Cabinet from the Room of Requirement is there. Three more books and a telescope on the Astronomy Tower can also be included.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't think I will go into much detail about the actual castle, because that much can easily be seen on pictures, but I will say the rooms. From a back angle, starting on the left, at the top is the Astronomy Tower, but is NOT the highest tower in the castle, like in the book. Underneath that is the library, complete with glass book case, which side back to allow usage of three brown books that really open. It includes two handcuffs and two keys. Underneath is the Room of Requirement, with the Vanishing Cabinet, which opens and allows people to stay inside. A small doorwayish thing connect that building to the next. Starting at the top. The Owlery. Complete with two pedestals and three owls and owl droppings. below is the Griffindor Common Room, with two red chairs and a small desk. Also a Griffindor House flag and fireplace. A thing on the back can be pressed forward to reveal Sirius' head. Below that is an interpretation of a hallway. With a suit of armor that can spin to reveal a black, openable Tom Riddle's Diary. Below is the Slytherin Common Room with a torch, two snakes, a 2x2 Slytherin tile on the wall, and two black chairs and a green desk. Next to that tower (the tallest), is the Great Hall. This includes 15 windows in the back, two black axes, orange and blue stained-glass windows, two chairs for teachers, a pedestal for the Headmaster to speak from (unfortunately no eagle), with two candles, two long House tables, with six golden goblets, a cake, a roasted chicken, four cherries (two red, two green), a croissant, a golden plate, two House tapestries (Griffindor and Slytherin), a wooden door, and a chandelier. In the final building, at the bottom, is the Trophy Room with what I said earlier, a wooden door, a treasure chest with a red diamond and scroll, and two sticker paintings. To get to the next floor, there is a spiral staircase that can 'open' and 'close,' like in the book with the password. On the second floor is Dumbledore's Office, which can double as a Potions Storeroom. There are two bookcases with eight potion bottles. In the center of the room os the desk, with crystal ball, Daily Prophet, and magnifying glass. Behind the desk is a chair that looks more like a throne. On the top floor is the Sword of Griffindor and the Sorting Hat. The front of the castle is very, very detailed.&nbsp;<br><br>This is an amazing lego set and I highly recommend buying it. The one big problem is that the rooms don't give minifigures enough space to stand. I would recommend (if you have a LOT of money) buying two or more, and combining them to give you a larger space. If you can't do that, I would build on! Add more details and rooms, make the place bigger, is what I say. Or, if you have more Harry Potter sets, combine them to make an even bigger Hogwarts. Also, I think they should have included Ron, because the castle is sort of lonely without the three main characters. Draco Malfoy should also be in the set, because there is a Slytherin Common Room, but no Slytherins to be in it. But, overall, I would say this is a great set, with lots of secrets and hidden artifacts, tons of detail, and great new minifigures. Thank you for reading this extensively long review on Hogwarts Castle.<br></span>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"thejoker34","2012-08-19T16:38:01.183Z","Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!","I love Harry Potter. Simple as that. I've read the book series 5 times, watched the movies time after time, and have probably seen the 1st movie 20 times. No I'm not exaggerating. So when I saw a Hogwarts castle set, I had to get it. I have to say, this truly is my favorite set of all time, and a true must buy!<div><br></div><h4>Box and Instructions</h4><div>The box is nice, and has the castle displayed against a night sky with some dementors flying around. The Instructions were fine and had no mistakes.</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigures</h4><div>The minifigures in this set are excellent! I loved all of them, and loved the fact that it came with 5 exclusive figures! With plenty of teachers, and even a Lord Voldemort Minifigure to fight them, they allow tons of playability. So without further ado, lets get to the minifigures!</div><div><br></div><div>The first minifigure is the obvious Harry Potter. He has his Hogwarts uniform on, as well as his normal brown wand. This Harry is in 5 different sets, so he's about as far from rare as you can get, but, it wouldn't be a Harry Potter set without Harry!</div><div><br></div><div>The next character we get is Hermione Granger, in her school uniform also. She's a pretty nice minifigure, and you only get her in one other set (Hagrid's Hut) so she's a bit rare. She's fun to have with Harry, but this brings out a flaw in the minifigures. There is no Ron figure! So the triumphant trio has been left for the dynamic duo in this set, and surprisingly, in a lot of sets! Ron has actually become quite the hard character to find. But enough of that, on to the next figure!</div><div><br></div><div>We next get Professor McGonagall, the head of Gryffindor, and Transfiguration teacher. She is surprisingly a great figure, with a great amount of detailing and a cool green cape. She has a dress for her legs like a lot of female figures these days, and it fits her well, as she is always wearing a dress throughout the series. She is one of the exclusive figures in the set, and is really quite awesome!</div><div><br></div><div>We next get the small teacher of Charms, Professor Flitwick. He looks weird, but I can't complain, because he looks just like the movie version, and is actually a really movie acurate character. He has the small legs, and thus you can't move them, but seeing as he really is a tiny character is the films, that's ok. He has a sort of vest with a bow tie for his torso, and a moustache that covers up where his mouth would be on his face. He's a great figure overall.</div><div><br></div><div>Next we get Argus Filch, the sort of custodian of Hogwarts. He's got a gray hairpiece and a very detailed head, with a lot of wrinkles and a bit of a beard. His shirt has a tie and some buttons, and he has some leg printing of a belt and some keys, seeing as he always has his keys. A nice feature is the set comes with a Mrs. Norris piece (his cat) and so you can have them running after misbehaving students all day. This is the only set available that has Filch, so that's a nice little bonus. He isn't the most movie acurate character, but he's fine all the same, and I'm glad they included him.</div><div><br></div><div>We next get Snape, the Potions teacher, and one of Harrys arch enemies. Throughout the books and movies he is constantly rude and mean to Harry, obviously favoring students like Draco Malfoy, from his own house of Slytherin, to Gryffindor students. He's a great character and it simply wouldn't be Hogwarts without Snape. He's an exclusive figure to this set as with the other teachers of the set. He's got a black hair piece, a face with a bit of brown wrinkles, and a bit of a scowl on his face. His shirt is detailed with a lot of buttons and he comes with a black cape. He also comes with his black wand.</div><div><br></div><div>Of course, what would be Hogwarts without the Dumbledore Minifigure. As headmaster of Hogwarts, he watches over the school and is a kind mentor throughout the series. Although he is an important character in the beginning of the series, he becomes much important as the series goes on, to the point that he's just as much a main character as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. He's got a nice detailed face with golden glasses, and some big hairpieces and a beard to cover him up, acurate to the series. His torso is detailed, although most of it is covered up by his beard. He is also an exclusive to this set which gives a lot of incentive to get the set. His entire body is a light blue, which is odd, because I don't remember him wearing light blue in the series, but the color fits him well, so I can't complain.</div><div><br></div><div>Next we get two dementors, which I personally think lego did a great job on. They have a sort of ripped cape that covers the front of their body also. Their body is made of a grey skeleton piece and a bottom that is a little peg, for sticking on top of the Hogwarts towers. They play a major role in the third movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and come up several times after that throughout the series. They are great minifigures, and they are only available in this set and the Battle of Hogwarts extension!</div><div><br></div><div>Next we get a Knight minifigure, which I actually don't count as a figure, as he is a set decoration in the castle, and isn't really built for playing. Enough said about that!</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, we get Voldemort. He's got a black cape, black torso, and black pants, with a little bit of detailing on his torso (mostly green lines that are supposed to represent wrinkles in his robe). He comes with a white wand, which is supposed to represent his ""bone wand"" from the movies. He's got a pale white face with dark eyes and yellow teeth. Overall a great minifigure!</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div>Wow that was a lot of figures. Anyway, the build was really fun, and took a long time as you would expect. The toughest part for me was building the slytherin common room, but other then that there's nothing that's really challenging.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Completed Model</h4><div>When you finally finish the Hogwarts Castle, the first thing you say is, ""Wow"". That sums it up pretty well. It's huge, detailed, and awesome! It's got a lot of details, and recreates tons of scenes from the movies and books, and is really just awesome!</div><div><br></div><div>Going from left to right (inside view), the first tower we get starts off at the bottom with a vanishing cabinet. This is great they added this detail, as it recreates a scene in the 6th Harry Potter, where Draco Malfoy sneaks several Death Eaters into the school through the vanishing cabinet, which is connected to the vanishing cabinet in Borgin and Burkes, the dark wizard store. The great thing is, in the Borgin and Burkes building in the Diagon Alley set, you get a matching Vanishing cabinet, so you can recreate the scene perfectly. The next floor has the ""restricted section"" of the library, where Harry goes looking for info on Nicholas Flamel in the first film. There is a feature where you can unlock the glass with some keys and then pull out the ""books"". This is a really cool floor, however there isn't much room for the minifigures to stand, so that is about the only drawback. The top floor is blank, just an open top which I believe is supposed to be the astronomy tower. Due to the fact that it shows to put Snape there, I believe it is supposed to recreate the ending scene of the Half Blood Prince (I won't say anymore for anyone who hasn't read or seen the movie). On to the next tower!</div><div><br></div><div>The next tower is great. The bottom floor has the Slytherin common room, however, seeing as we don't get any Slytherin students in this set, you have to buy several other sets to be able to populate the room. It has two snakes on the wall and a Slytherin Crest on the back wall. It has two chairs and a table where you can put the different parchment/paper pieces that come in the set, like the marauders map and an issue of the Quibbler. Moving on to the next floor is a feature where you place the knight minifigure on a sort of pedestal, and then can swing it around to reveal Tom Riddle's Diary. While this isn't exactly movie acurate, it's a nice detail Lego included, and I like it. The next floor is the Gryffindor common room, which is basically the Slytherin Common room, except red instead of green. It has the Gryffindor crest and once again, two chairs and a small table. The top floor is blank, but I believe is supposed to be the owelry, because there are several sort of spirals coming out from the tower where the instructions show to put the owl pieces. Two more towers to go!</div><div><br></div><div>The next tower is actually not a tower. It's the great hall, where the students eat. It has 3 seats where the teachers can sit including the headmasters chair, accurate to the movies, and it has a lot of food pieces. However, one thing I'm not too thrilled about, is that it only has the Gryffindor and Slytherin flags, and while the other two houses aren't very large in the story, it feels weird that they aren't even included. This part of the castle is great, because there are so many scenes that take place in it.</div><div><br></div><div>The final tower is Dumbledore's office. The bottom has the trophy room, where Hermione points out to Harry that his dad was a star quidditch player also, and the trophies even include a sticker saying James Potter, which is a great detail. They then have a moving staircase the goes up to the Headmasters office, which is easily the most detailed of all the rooms. Theres a ton of great potions made from transparent colored bricks, and has a crystal ball. It has a chair for Dumbledore to sit, and a microfying glass in case he can't examining something well enough (I guess even old wizards have hard time seeing). On top theres a great detail that has Gryffindors sword hanging up, and the Sorting hat, which goes on a little stand. On to the outside of the castle.</div><div><br></div><div>Surprisingly, the outside of the castle is just as detailed and awesome as the interior. It greatly resembles the first time you see Hogwarts in the first film when Harry and the other first years come over in the boats. Its great and very pretty to look at. And with that, I conclude the main model!</div><div><br></div><h4>Summary</h4><div>If you've stuck with me until the end of this review, you will know just how much I love this set. It is my favorite set of all time, and I have a lot of Lego Sets! It has a great assortment of minifigures, many of them exclusive, and a huge amount of detail and playability on the interior. The back looks amazingly beautiful and is great for display, and is a great deal for the money. 130.00 is a lot of money, but I must say for this set, it's worth it. One last little note I want to add, is that it looks even more splendid when you add it to the Battle of Hogwarts extension set. Overall this is a great set, and is a crowning jewel of any Lego Collection. I would recommend this to anyone!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Lego_black_pearl","2012-04-07T23:22:20.487Z","Review on hogwarts castle (2010 design)","This is the fourth hogwarts castle which was released in 2010. It includes Harry potter, Hermione granger, professor mcgonagall, professor dumbledore, professor snape, two dementors, a suit of armour, argus filich, lord voldermort and professor flitwick. Except of Hermione and Harry every character is other than new or redesigned. Argus filich and prof flitwick are exclusive to this set only. The castle has 1290 pieces which includes four buildings and connected bits. It is also sub-themed/based of &nbsp;the deathly hallows films. The first building is the astronomy tower which has a telescope on top and a rat hanging around. A floor down is The restricted section of the library with sliding doors on it as it has three brown books and handcuff locks to lock it as you will need two keys to open it. The bottom floor Is the room of requirment which has the vanishing cabinet based on the sixth film where Draco sneaks death eaters into the school. The next building is known as the common rooms tower but some say it is the gryffindor tower. At the top their is the owlery where there are two stands for the three owls ( white, grey and brown redesign) as there is also some white studs to repersent owl droppings? Down a floor is the gryffindor common room where there is a fireplace playability which can come out to the table and has Sirius black's face in it as based on the fourth film and the fourth and fifth novels. On the table you will find a clear shampaine glass as well as the marauders map and concludes two rotating red chairs. Finally there is a gryffindor symbol flag on top of the fireplace. Below that room is a suit of armour (knight) which is on a rotating stand and on the other side is Tom riddles dirary. On the bottom is the Slythrin common room with a torch, a snake, shampaine glass, two black chairs and a table with the quibbler newspaper. The third building is the great hall which now has a second design. The great hall has two tables for slythrin and gryffindor. At the front there is two chairs for the staff and a speech stand. On the tables a big cake, goblets, turkey and a plate of cherries will be decorated with. Last is dumbledores office which starts at the bottom with a door and inside is a trophy cabinet with a sheld printed with James potter seeker with two goblets around the shield. On the right there is a chest with a red jewel which could possibly be the philosopher's stone and there is a parchment tile with words on it. There is also a turning spiral staircase which leads to the main office which has two cabinets with potions bottles and a secret department with a letter and basiki fang. Dumbledore has a chair and a table with a crystal ball and a daily prophet newspaper that is being helped read with a magnifying glass. At the top hidden by the sand green turrent is the sorting hat with brown markings. All and all this is would be a 9 1/2 out of 10 set which.&nbsp;<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); "">It is recommended for ages 8-14 and Cost $129.99 which I thought was a little bit pricey as it should have been maybe $110.

"legoredboots3","2012-01-17T20:13:33.89Z","A Super Fun Set","<p>Okay, this set is highly fun and playable. First of all, it comes with eleven mini-figures. On brickset, it shows Snape with a black and purple shirt and Voldenmort with green clothes. Also, Argus Filch has the wrong face. The eleventh mini-figure is a knight that isn't pictured on the box, because it's impersonating a suit of armor.</p><p>&nbsp; Minerva McGonagall has a REALLY printed body, it's highly detailed. Harry and Hermione are in their school outfits, no Ron? :-( Dumbledore is in a nice light-blue robe. Flitwick is a new figure and has a nice hair-pice along with a small tuxedo similiar to the Gringotts goblins. Snape has nice new black robes and a stern expression. Voldemort has a white head and a snake-like face. Filch is grumpy, and he accompanys a nicely-detailed cat, Mrs. Norris. Two dementors (awesome) are included in this set and they have reversable heads to let them administer the Dementor's Kiss.</p><p>&nbsp; Now, with the set itself, it is simply stunning. There is a Vanishing Cabinet. A library with moving doors with locks to protect the books inside. An Astronomy tower with a telescope. Dumbledore's Office has a revolving stairway leading to it and is full of many important things such as a crystal ball and Gryffindor's sword. The Sorting Hat has its own little tower-top. There is also a trophy gallery with many trophies including&nbsp;a James Potter Seeker shield. The Great Hall has two student tables and a teacher table with a large presentation area. A spinning chandelier and banners hang from the ceiling. Cakes and turkeys rest on the tables. There is also a Gryffindor dormintory with chairs and Sirius' head poking out of the fire, and a Slytherian dormintory with chairs and snakes. An Owlery is at hand, stocked with owls.</p><p>&nbsp; The castle in a whole, is a stunning representation of Harry Potter's view as he crossed the lake for the first time. It's an amazing, truly detailed set. The only downside is that numerous small pieces are used, making the castle slightly smaller than it's precessors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, it's an awesome set.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"meme100","2013-01-08T13:49:37.753Z","This set is AWSOME","<p>This set is very good with many playabilities. Lego made you pay 102.99. But i got it for 82.99 at Amazon. Also ten minifigures is great but i really wish they put Ron in it. The features are amazing as well as the detail.</p><p>If you can get it GET IT. </p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,3
"HungerGamer","2014-03-17T20:10:29.383Z","Hogwarts Castle 1 Review","<p>This set is one of the best sets Lego has created. It is truly amazing. This version of the Hogwarts Castle provides hours of hard work and playtime. This set includes 11 minifigures&nbsp;which all represent a room in Hogwarts. This also includes many familiar objects like the Philosophers Stone, Gryffindor Sword and even 3 owls. There a four different sections and does connect with the Deathly Hallows version of it too, making six. This took me many days to create but was defiantly&nbsp;worth it in the end. It does get confusing at some points but you do get the gist of how it works. Adult help might be needed for younger ones due to the many pieces. The &quot;chimneys&quot; are also very easy to accidentally break off. As i have my Lego sets on a big cabinet table the &quot;chimneys&quot; are usually snapped off while dusting. Glue would be useful to keep those attached. 10/10&nbsp;</p>

"HarleyMeenen","2016-08-22T03:48:26.127Z","Excellent Set","<p>As a huge Harry Potter fan, I was extremely excited to get to work on this set. It still takes me at least two days to complete, so it&#39;s a good time investment. It&#39;s also quite large, with a good amount of detail in the different rooms and decorations. There are some cool features and inclusions, such as the Sorting Hat, the Sword of Gryffindor, a suit of armor, and stained glass windows in the Great Hall.</p>

<p>The main downsides are the lack of a Ron minifigure, which I would certainly have included over characters such as Filch, and the fragility of some sections. For example, I&#39;ve had pieces fall off when attaching sections together, the tower with the common rooms seems prone to separating, and the roof of the Great Hall can be finicky.</p>

<p>Overall, though, I&#39;m very happy with the set and have built it multiple times. It looks great on display and has good playability with the number of rooms and minifigures. Definitely a great investment, and a set I would readily recommend to Harry Potter fans as well as anyone looking for an interesting, worthwhile&nbsp;build.</p>

"TrueEF5","2015-12-20T08:36:44.74Z","Okay set but it does have some flaws","<p>This set is best for someone that would rather have it on display than play with it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box illustrates the abilities of the set well and the instructions are mostly easy to understand.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts for this set are well chosen and suit the build well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are a good amount of minifigures that add to the playability but don&#39;t add to much of it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly simple and is easy to complete with two or more people.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks good on display but isn&#39;t as playable as other sets such as the Death Star. There are a good amount of rooms and a nice amount of things that you can make the minifigures do. This model is better for display than it is for playing with, and I know because I&#39;m a KFOL.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is definitely worth buying if you are a Harry Potter fan but not really if you like to play with your lego.</p>
