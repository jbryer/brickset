<h4>What I liked</h4>
<ul><li>Good if you want a simple starter set for a kid just getting into LEGO</li><li>Lots of small builds for kids to play with</li><li>At least there's a minifig</li></ul>
<h4>What I didn't</h4>
<ul><li>Not interesting once you pass about age 6</li><li>No interesting parts, i.e. hinges and unique parts</li><li>The minifig's really not that great</li></ul>
<h4>Verdict</h4><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don't buy it unless you're some sort of brick bucket&nbsp;completest. If you want a brick &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bucket, the more current ones offer you a lot more than just bricks.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,2,5
