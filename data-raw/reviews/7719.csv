Still you get lots of useful pieces for MOCing, especially light, medium and dark green ones.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>However it lacks the light brick for the eyes (although it is quite easy to add it behind the orange eyes, if you happen to have an extra one around), but presents a new fun ferocious function instead: you can switch the lever on the back to open and close the jaws.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This is a really cool feature that I have not seen before, built with a piece of string attached to a 1x1 round brick at each end. The other end of the string is connected to the upper jaw, which shows some impressive SNOT work.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>By the way, that's where the weakest spot of this otherwise very robust creature seems to be: if you pull the lever several times forcefully all the way back, you just might be able to detach the top of the upper jaw. That's a very minor fault, and all other parts including the four legs are strong enough to withstand almost anything an enthusiastic player might think of.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to the legs being similar, the building experience may feel a bit repetitive. Otherwise the clever design is interesting to build.</p><p><br></p><p>There are printed instructions for two alternative models, a dino and fish, but these models are not so cool because they do not use the lever with a string attached and their wagging tails are not quite so much fun as in the croc. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Overall a great set and a must have for both new and old Creator fans, 9/10. Excellent playability and value for money.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"wander099","2011-04-14T16:39:14.957Z","An excellent example of what the creator theme can be","<p>This is my first creator set since previously all I have had of the theme are tubs of basic blocks.&nbsp; And I must say that I am very much impressed with the set.&nbsp; I built all three models so that I could give a complete review.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is medium sized and it shows a large picture of the main model-the crocodile.&nbsp; The picture makes it look like a really great model, and it doesn't disappoint.&nbsp; You get two instruction manuals: one for the crocodile and the other for the secondary models (the t-rex and the fish).<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set comes with five pairs of hinges for the whip-like tails included on each model.&nbsp; This set is also abundant with green pieces of various shades and also comes with some tan and brown plates of various sizes.&nbsp; So I suppose that if you are looking for parts for a snake or something, this is the set for you.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>No minifigures.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Crocodile:</p><p>As the main model, the build was the most complex and took the most time.&nbsp; It used almost all of the pieces, but there were some left over.&nbsp; The build wasn't simplistic, but it was not particularly complex either.&nbsp; At a reasonable pace (no hurry) it took me almost an hour.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">T-Rex:</p><p>This is the second model, so it uses fewer pieces than the crocodile-there are a significant number of pieces left over when you are done.&nbsp; The build is even simpler than the crocodile and much shorter.&nbsp; It takes under 30 minutes and there are no really complicated steps or mechanisms.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fish:</p><p>This model is physically the smallest and as such uses the least pieces.&nbsp; There are a great deal of pieces left over when finished.&nbsp; It doesn't take very long to build and it is very simple.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Crocodile:</p><p>This model is wonderful and is definitely my favourite.&nbsp; The tail has hinges and can be whipped back and forth, which is a feature I really enjoy.&nbsp; But what I like even more is the opening mechanism for the jaw.&nbsp; Not only does the exterior and interior of the jaw look excellent, but you can push and pull a switch on the crocodile's back to make it open and close.&nbsp; If you pull it back all the way, the jaw is held open until you release it.&nbsp; The head can also be moved from side to side and the legs are moveable too (but the model can only stand with them in a specific position).&nbsp; Aesthetically, this model is the best and I love it.&nbsp; It looks great from all angles and is really well-designed.&nbsp; I am particularly impressed with the design of the jaws which is really cool.&nbsp; This model makes a great display piece and a great toy to play with (it is also quite sturdy and unlikely to break frequently).<br></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">T-Rex:</p><p>I don't like this model at all.&nbsp; First of all, the head is over-sized and the lower jaw is much too thick.&nbsp; Moreover, the mouth opens comically wide and isn't that well designed inside-it looks ridiculous.&nbsp; The arms are too small, lack articulation, and lack detail; frankly, they look silly.&nbsp; Considering the amount of extra pieces, they could have been better designed.&nbsp; Also, I don't like the legs because they are attached too close to the arms and have massive feet.&nbsp; I understand the practical aspect of this, as without that amount of surface area on the feet, the model would not be able to stand, but aesthetically, it isn't very pleasing.&nbsp; The tail does have the same whipping motion as the crocodile, but considering all the cons for this model, it isn't enough to recommend ever building it.&nbsp; My megablocks t-rex from years ago is better designed than this!<br></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fish:</p><p>I like this model more than the t-rex, but not as much as the crocodile.&nbsp; While it doesn't look great from the side view, it does look impressive (and a bit scary) from the front.&nbsp; From this angle it looks quite dangerous with all those teeth, especially when it's mouth opens.&nbsp; Unlike the t-rex, the mouth opens a reasonable amount and looks good doing so.&nbsp; In my opinion, the fins are a bit stubby and could have been made bigger, but they are well-designed and their size is less noticeable from the front and they aren't way too small like the t-rex's arms, so I'm not too displeased about this aspect.&nbsp; The fins can also be moved horizontally as well as rotated.&nbsp; Like the first two models, this one has the whip tail and in this case you can use it to make a nice swimming motion.&nbsp; The end of the tail isn't too great, but it can be modified if you want since there are so many extra pieces.&nbsp; This model makes a great toy to play with, though it is less sturdy than the crocodile.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I strongly recommend this set.&nbsp; The main model is excellent, and one of the alternates is good as well.&nbsp; It isn't terribly expensive and makes both a good display piece and a good toy to play with.&nbsp; Plus the build isn't overly easy, overly complex, or repetitive, it is just enjoyable!&nbsp; I think both kids and adults will love this and I am definitely glad that I decided to buy this one.&nbsp; Lots of small pieces though, so not good for young kids who lose/eat pieces.&nbsp; I hope Lego comes out with another creatures creator set that is just as good!<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
