My six and a half year old son managed to build most of it with only minimal help from me. He's been playing with it constantly since we put it together last night. The rear compartment is handy for hiding things (so he tells me) and the ship is a nice size for fitting a small group of baddies.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>the mini figs are nice, Cad Bane is the star of the show and a figure my son has been longing for since he first appeared on Cartoon network&nbsp;last march. The Senate captain and the new pirate are also&nbsp;nice additions to the range.

"desire4one","2010-08-03T00:49:57.04Z","Bane's Limo Service:  We'll Out Shoot the Competition","<p>This set was a pleasant surprise...for the most part.&nbsp; It's a great looking airspeeder, with room for passengers - what a concept!&nbsp; You don't see that much these days.&nbsp; It has a feel and look that implies it was designed well.</p>
<p>The speeder has great stability.&nbsp; Thats a major plus.&nbsp; Plenty of light colored gray pieces and dark colored blue pieces and a few unique pieces that are hard to find.&nbsp; The stickers aren't even that lame.&nbsp; The ""trunk"" has a tendacy to fly open on its own, not enough pegs to secure it.&nbsp; Two firing missles use a feature a bit more inventive than ""flick fire"", adding a tiny measure of class to the set.</p>
<p>The minifigs are big reason to get this one.&nbsp; It's the cheapest set to get Cad Bane (as of right now) and he doesn't dissapoint with new torso and head pieces, a new breathing apparatus and a HUGE hat.&nbsp; My gripe comes from the fact that he doesn't have actual blaster ""pistols"", just more of the standard rifles in so many sets.&nbsp; He managed to liberate two gray pistols from Slave 1 and he's very happy about it.</p>
<p>The Senate Guards look really cool.&nbsp; The officer with the war paint screams to be a center piece.&nbsp; It would have been perfect with the addition of another regular Senate Commando.</p>
<p>The Weequay pirate is great too, begging to join the ranks of your pirate fleet.</p>
<p>The assassin droid is old at this point.&nbsp; Lets have something else...maybe another Senate Commando?</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Airspeeder is stable and comfortably seats 6.&nbsp; Great for raiding Jedi Temples.</li>
<li>Lots and lots of light gray and dark blue pieces.&nbsp; The Imperial enthausist will rejoice.</li>
<li>Cad Bane at the cheapeast your likely find him.&nbsp; He looks a lot like Clint Eastwood.</li>
<li>Senate Commandos and another Weequay pirate.</li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>A bit overpriced.&nbsp; This would have been perfectly priced at $35-$40, but what else is new?</li>
<li>Airspeeder trunk is not secure - pieces stored inside will fall out.</li>
<li>Another Assassin droid?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Throw him in the scrap pile.</li>
<li>What does a guy have to do to get some Blaster Pistols around here?</li></ul>
<p>Overalll I was pleased with the set.&nbsp; There's not a lot of playability here for the younglings.&nbsp; This is more of a collector piece.&nbsp; Once thats established, you'll be better for it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"PluffTed","2010-08-05T18:14:08.84Z","Really Underated Set!","<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>I had bought this set off of the Target website and I received it from UPS today.&nbsp; This is one of the most trashed Star Wars set I've ever heard of.&nbsp; People hate the ship and say that you get it only for the figures.&nbsp; I think it's in the top 20 Star Wars sets of all time!</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<p>The ship itself is very awesome!&nbsp; There are 3 pieces that I've never seen!&nbsp; It features a trunk, four passenger seats, 1 driver seat, 1 front passenger seat, a rack for 2 guns, and some of the best Star Wars figures ever!&nbsp; It came with my very first Cad Bane figure (also comes with the 8098 Clone Turbo Tank) and his pirate assistant Shahan Alama (this is the only set you can get with Alama).&nbsp; It also came with my first Senate Commando figure (also comes with the 8039 Venator-Class Republic Attack Cruiser), a Senate Commando Captain figure (this is the only set you can get with the Senate Commando Captain), and last but not least, a black Assassin Droid Elite (also comes with the 8015 Assassin Droids Battle Pack).&nbsp; The building experience was pretty cool, and the playability is great since you can pretend Cad Bane with his Assassin Droid and Shahan Alama are escaping the 2 Senate Commandos.</p>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<p>There are only a couple complaints with this set.&nbsp; The first is that the black Assassin Droid Elite kind of moves around in the seats.&nbsp; The second is that if you seat a figure in one of the 4 seats in the back and you put a gun in the rack in front of him, he would be a little too close to that gun.&nbsp; The last I'm very mad about.&nbsp; The last is that this set is priced way, way, way too high at $49.99!&nbsp; Many people including myself would have thought this set to be $39.99!&nbsp; Oh well, what can you do?</p>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>I would really recommend this set to any Lego fan!&nbsp; When you listen or read any reviews that trash it, they're talking non-sense.&nbsp; Very great set!</p>

"parchioso","2010-08-08T03:03:29.47Z","A good balance of values in vehicle and minifigs","<p>8128 Cad Bane's Speeder is a unique vehicle, although the color is a little dull, the design is quite interesting, I ususally would focus equally on the vehicle and minifigs, but I have to say that the bounty hunter is really a cool villain, as well as Shahan Alama, the Senate Commando Officers are nice but somehow I do not like the blue color much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vehicle has some playability, the rear end compartment can be opened, but moving the propeller along with it seems to be a little wierd, missile launchers have not been my favorite, but the real nice thing is the six seaters, and the driver cabin is quite cool, the vehicle is just big enough to create a realistic feel.</p>
<p><br/>8128 pricing is quite high, a little overpriced but tolerable, but since this is the only set to get Shahan Alama I believe, and you also get Cad Bane and the senate guards, as well as the cool vehicle, it is worth collecting.</p>

"David1971","2011-01-03T15:27:13.673Z","An interesting ship... with nice figs, more than enough seats, and a boot!","<p>This is an interesting design of ship, with a large lower part which - along with the grey and blue colours - makes it resemble a whale or shark (to some extent). </p>
<p>Having six seats is highly unusual and really good. I reviewed Set #7672: Rogue Shadow, in October 2008,&nbsp;and had to point out that although it was a really big ship, and Darth Vader had two co-pilots with him, it only had one seat! So having a ship where everybody can sit down (and bring a couple of friends!) was really nice. And it has a boot (in the US that's a trunk) with quite a bit of room for equipment. In fact there's room for a whole minifig to hide in there ... as long as he takes his hat off!</p>
<p>The minifigs are good: Cad Bane is really great, very detailed, nicely done and with a great big hat. He looks just right in the driving seat of the ship (which, charmingly, has a standard Lego steering wheel, same as&nbsp;in 1979). That other bounty hunter, Shahan Alama (apparently), is also very nice - having a golden arm is&nbsp;cool!&nbsp;And the blue&nbsp;Senate Commandos are fine and in particular it's very good that they have actual heads under their helmets (unlike the sets where&nbsp;stormtroopers&nbsp;have black blobs&nbsp;where their heads should be ... which always seemed shocking ... do they still do that?). (The Assassin Droid, I don't really count as a minifig, they look silly and ... well it's just not really a minifig is it ... I just ignore that really. But the four proper minifigs are all good and all unusual).</p>
<p>A minor negative point is that the flick-fire missiles are pretty lame, as always. I don't really count those as a feature. In this case, rather than pushing the missile itself, you push a rod that pushes the missile, but that's not really a clever launching system.</p>
<p>I try not to mention price too much these days, in reviews of Lego Star Wars,&nbsp;because we *know* these sets are expensive. Nevertheless, £45 (UK) is obviously a lot. For £35 it would be fine whilst still being a 'premium' product compared to other toys etc. (But compare with another 2010 licensed Lego set, #7789: Lotso's Dump Truck, from the Toy Story 3 line, which&nbsp;gave you a good vehicle and 3 (or 4) minifigs ... for just £15!).</p>
<p>Overall, if we ignore the price, or think of it as a £33 set (good value!) plus a £12 donation to Lego for being our favourite company (well it is!), then this is a very good set.</p>

The white patterned royal guard is new, which is a plus, but the other characters fail to compensate for the rip-off price because they are available in other sets. Best to request this set as a gift, like I did, so you won't have to humble yourself by paying $50. The back portion of the ship has a storage compartment for guns, light sabers,etc. and the four chair set up is similar to the interiors of other clone wars sets now for sale. There are, of course, decals galore in this set, and are all a hassle to apply, especially when you realize that all lego stickers eventually peel off for one reason or another. Mediocre, yes.

The photo's don't due it justice. Once built you have a sturdy, well designed, swooshable model that has some nice heft and weight to it plus&nbsp;the kit&nbsp;includes 5 great mini-figures (2 are New issues).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PRO's...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Great designs and line throughout the ship. Well detailed and looks good in any angle.</li>
<li>Nice looking yet simple rear engines.</li>
<li>2 front 'tap' fire missiles, left and right disguised as front headlights (note middle headlight not a missile). Works well.</li>
<li>6 seating areas that'll 'actually' fit 6 mini-figs comfortably (2 in cockpit, 4 in passenger area).</li>
<li>Front cockpit has printed tile control panel.</li>
<li>2 clips in passenger area to hold guns/tools/etc.</li>
<li>Rear large open/close trunk. Again for weapons, tools, etc.</li>
<li>Good weight and a sturdy model.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MINI-FIGs...</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Great Cad Bane mini-fig with large brimed brown hat and cool looking breathing apparatus. Also comes with 2 blasters.</li>
<li>NEW Shahan Alama mini-fig w/blaster. Hat is same mold as Hondo Ohnaka's hat but this one is dark red. Head is same as Turk Falso but Shahan's is a dark grey with different forehead graphic. Torso is completely a new design (front/back graphics) and the right arm is a pearl gold (arm and hand) while the left arm is dark blue w/dark grey hand. Dark blue legs, no graphics.</li>
<li>Senate Commando mini-fig with rifle blaster.</li>
<li>NEW Senate Commando Captain mini-fig w/rifle blaster. Same design as Senate Commando but with added white graphics to helmet and front torso chest armor.</li>
<li>Assassin Droid, black mini-fig. with rifle blaster (same Assassin Droid from 8015 Assassin's Droid Battle Pack).</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CON's...</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>PRICE! Yes, sorry to say it again and rant with so many others but for about 318 pieces the $50.00 dollar price tag is way over the top. There are some interesting figures and some cool pieces for MoC's but this is a $30.00 - $35.00 model tops! </li>
<li>Stickers. These stickers don't seem to enhance the model. Looks just as good, if not better without them.</li>
<li>Rear tail fin falls off if you hold it wrong when opening trunk.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one great looking speeder and I only recommend it if you have the $50.00 to spare or even though it's a <em>'Special Edition'</em> which connocts some kind of rarity (who knows) I'd wait for a sale on this one. </p>

"Ypres","2010-09-26T23:21:06.017Z","Really a ""Take it, or Leave it"" Set.","<p>I bought this set today, and while I am satisfied in some aspects there is a lot that requires 'commenting' on. </p>
<p>First of all, and most importantly, the price: Don't let the nice box art fool you because this ship isn't incredibly big. One would think with six seats the speeder is quite roomy, however it is not... and having four people in the back makes minifigs awkwardly close. I bought this set at Zellers in Canada for $40CAD. Since I knew this set retailed for $50US in America I decided to pick it up. Of course the only appeal for this set is its minifigs, unless you just want every set. After building the set I still feel paying $40 dollars to be a bit too much. The ship itself honestly looks $30 at most! But like I said, the minifigs are quite good (minus the useless droid). </p>
<p>The ship itself is nothing beyond average. The only fun part about building is figuring out where all the little pieces will finally fit... obviously no different than constructing other Lego sets. I'm not going to go on about the design since that's Starwars, but I will say the design doesn't really catch your eye. It's not at all a set I'd suggest a mother get for her kid (price wise), just simply to add to a collection. I don't really see this set scoring higher than 3, although maybe it could pass as a 4 with some bias. </p>
<p>Individual parts are okay. A nice shade of grey and an uncommon colour of blue make up the majority of Cad Bane's Speeder. The only thing that scores the pieces higher than normal are the minifig parts: Senate Commando, ect. If you just want a Cad Bane minifig I do suggest just buying the Turbo Tank, even if you own the old one like I do. </p>
<p>To further rain on a future buyer's parade, this set also comes with stickers! And yes, they aren't easily applied. So bottom line; okay set... but good luck finding an 'okay' price for it. Like I said, Zellers (in Canada) retails it for $40CAD. </p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,1

 Minifigures: Cad Bane, he's new. Good job Lego. Assassin Droid: I have too many. Please make the commando droids. Senate commando and Capitan: Nice 'figs. I like them. The other bounty hunter (can't remember how to spell it) has Lego's ideas of symmetry gone with the wind. The golden arm is cool. He's good for adding a neutral faction.

 Parts: Rare dark-blue, Bley, trans blue and trans yellow. Nice colors with no saturation. Some airplane parts for inside the engines. Nothing else special to me.

 Build: Good and simple. I know this set never had a predecessor. That makes it an original. I had trouble with the stickers. Every single time.

Overall: It's good with me. The seating is tight in back with all 'figs in. The droid slides around. 50 bucks isn't what I wanted plus tax. Most likely the lowest rated I've ever gone.

<p><br/>The set really shines when it comes to the mini-figs.&nbsp; The Senate Commado and Captain are nicely done (although they come with clone heads and these guys weren’t clones…but that’s hardly a big deal since the faces are covered up by their cool helmets).&nbsp; Shahan Alama and the Assassin droid are OK and I really like Cad Bane.&nbsp; I think his hat is my new favorite mini-fig accessory as it just makes the character.&nbsp; I also like how they incorporate the breathers as both an accessory and painted on his face.&nbsp; At the price I got it at I am quite happy with the purchase but had I paid full price -- maybe not so much. <br/></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,3

	I have had this set a while. The speeder is sleek and beautiful, about Jedi Starfighter size. The minifigures are very nice, too. Cad Bane is definately my favourite, though the Senate Commandos are cool, too. Shahan Alama is okay, but the Assasin Droid is a little boring. The speeder has a large storage compartment at the back, which can be used for storing blasters and similar items. The flick fire missiles are very well built into the ship, you don&#39;t even notice that they&#39;re missiles. The speeder looks a lot like it&#39;s Clone Wars counterpart.

<p>Shahan Alma:Actuly a cool bounty hunter,he has a duble sided head and cheast,also he has a golden arm!I think that its a robot arm,not sure,still cool!Assian droid; Just a normal assian droid.This set also inclouds a senate comando which is also quiet rare,and a senate commando captian which is exclusive and actuly quiet cool and has some white markings on his armor.They have clone heads.</p>
<p>The speeder:The front of the speeder fetures the driver and passenger seat,behind that theres four seats and a blaster rack for two blasters and could seat four armed minifigs comfortebly.Finaly in the rear theres the thrusters and a hatch that swings down semlessly.This is good for blaster starage,bounty hunter gear(mine has hand cuffs in it)and the ocasianl hostage,which you can just fit.Also the feture where the head lights shoot of is hooky.Its nicely designed,but it just dosnt work.I wish there was a covering that went over the mechinasim.Its fairly big and it has some weight to it and its pretty solid.It has a lot of playability,like abducting senate comandos.The one problem is that it lacks a Aura Sing and commando droid,but the new bouty hunter gunship has one so thats ok.</p>

This is a nice set I picked up at a discounted price of $40. it's got good minifigures and being my (technically) first ever star wars set, I got lots of new, aerodynamic pieces.<br><br>THE BUILD<br><br>probably one of the best builds i have ever had. lots of techniques that you can't find in good old city or other themes. There is an interesting, small hatch/storing brig/thingie hinged at the back using some technic. Flick missiles are shot more effectively in this set, as a technic rod punches the flick missile. this makes flick missiles able to go far without flicking.<br>there are lots of intricate details in the passanger area, such as studs, transparent bricks, etc.<br><br>THE COMPLETED MODEL &amp; FEATURES<br><br>Its got a nice, streamlined&nbsp; look achieved with lots of angular plates. its rather shaped like a puffer fish though. its a bit lacking on functions. its only got flick missiles and an opening hatch. i wanted to compare it to the source material, but i can't find it :(<br><br>MINIFIGURES<br><br>you get some great minifigures here. Cad bane the bounty hunter is well decorated with a breathing tube. the senate guard is also cool, looking like a cross between a blue stormtrooper and a spartan warrior. You also get an assassin droid,but that isn't very interesting. the other two figures are advertised on the box to be new. the first is the Weequay pirate-turned-bounty hunter shahan alama. he looks similar to the pirates you can find in the pirate tank. he's got the exact same right arm as C3P0. last but not least we have the senate commando, similar to the senate guard but with white markings, giving a more regal feel. you get 3 blasters(two for bane, one for shahan) and 3 rifles (one for the assassin droid, and one for each of the senates) to complement the minifigures.<br><br>OVERALL<br><br>NIce set in overall, with good figures and a nice (albeit puffer-fish-looking) speeder. i can't say it's worth your money for $50, but get it at a discount.<br><br>This is my very first review, so sorry for the unproffesional look and if it is too long.<br></span>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,3
"wii1232","2013-08-03T11:28:50.537Z","Needs More Minifigures!","<p>In order to follow the story of Season One, Episode 22 of Star Wars The Clone Wars ""Hostage Crisis"", LEGO should have put&nbsp;five more minifigures in there-Aurra Sing, Robonino, Helios 3D, and 2 Commando Droids.</p><p>  Combined with Cad Bane, Shahan Alama, IG-86 the Senate Commando and Senate Commando Captain, that would only be only 10.&nbsp; That would make the price a good one.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,3,4
"VenatorBricks","2019-06-09T22:44:09.303Z","An interesting model.","<h2>Set:</h2>

<p>The speeder itself is the only model ever created. It is pretty accurate to speeder featured in the Clone Wars TV show.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Price:</h2>

<p>For $50, you get a decent price per piece, but the speeder seems so small for that price. The minifiGures sure make up for it, though.</p>

<h2>Playability:</h2>

<p>I know that the set has two flick fires missles on the front, and that the back portion can be opened up to reveal extra storage.</p>

<h2>Display:</h2>

<p>The set is not a good display piece, but would look better being displayed on a lower shelf.</p>

<h2>Minifigures:</h2>

<p>You get the unique Cad Bane figure, Shahan Alama (who is exclusive to this set), a common Assassin Droid, ans two Senate Commandos, who are really neat! i only wish it included the other bounty hunters associated with this vehicle in the show, such as Aurra Sing and Robonino.</p>

<h2>Overall:</h2>

<p>The set is well worth it, but is more of a collector set than a playset. Kids who just enjoy sets like this would love this sets uniqueness.&nbsp;</p>
