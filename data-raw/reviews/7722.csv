down in LEGOland California. And as it's part of the Atlantis theme that I'm 
loving, I'm kindof wanting to pick up all the sets, big and small that I
 can.</p><p>It's a fun little set, quick and easy to put together. And certainly 
helps flesh out the Atlantis series for the Divers to encounter and run 
into.</p><h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are on a folded sheet of paper, either side following LEGO's clear step-by-step illustrations.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>As a small, polybag set, there are only 42 pieces in this set. Most of which are black and go for creating the look of the Octopus. There is an odd ball piece of one of the Atlantis Portal Rings. The ring is alright, I'm just not sure what to do with it or where to put it.</p><h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>Where the head is concerned, it's kind of hard for me to imagine that this is an Octopus. Thankfully the tentacles on this creature get the point across of what it's supposed to be. My minor complaint and draw-back to this set is that the head spins.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I'd still pick this set up, regardless as it's part of the Atlantis theme and I've really been loving the contrasting color choices and really the creature designs on this aquatic theme. That this is a small polybag set and easily affordable make for some strong points in this set's favor.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,4
