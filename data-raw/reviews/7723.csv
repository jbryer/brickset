The curved sharp dorsal fin is an added bonus.</div><div><br></div><div>The set falls apart (figuratively, not literally) at the front. The mouth looks too big for the fish's body,and it lacks an upper jaw. &nbsp;That would make it a pretty useless piranha. Still, the round treasure key more than compensated for the missing upper jaw in my 5 yr old son's mind.</div><div><br></div><div>Given that the set was a freebie with a newspaper, I'd say it was unbeatable value for money.

"AETerry","2011-01-18T22:27:14.467Z","Piranha Review! I have half a head sir!","<p>All that's needed is for these to be sold where people can buy them up in multiples to create a piranha swarm. I got mine through e-bay and it wasn't that bad of a price to pick up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now to burst the bubble of those who are getting excited by this little set....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was very thrilled with the idea of a Lego Piranha utilizing the Atlantis color scheme for their creatures. The main body is built well and the tail isn't bad, provided you don't mind the grey connecting piece that will cause the tail to spin a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem with this set comes with the head of the creature. And it's with the jaw... the design build only has the lower jaw, there's no upper jaw and causes the build to not look right or complete. That feature greatly detracts from the overall enjoyment of this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a small set that comes in a polybag, experienced builders will know not to get their hopes up on complex builds. For those in the UK it was free with the purchase of a newspaper. But come on... it's like LEGO blew it with this set and model.</p>",TRUE,2,3,3,3,3
