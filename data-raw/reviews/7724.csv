"AETerry","2010-10-23T20:03:27.94Z","Mini Sub Review","<p>Imagine my surprise to go into Target thinking I'd have a snowball's chance with finding the Series 2 Minifigure Collection in the Halloween section only to discover that they had this little set and a miniset for World Racers in the aisle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm hoping the 7.99 PLN I've been reading of other reviewers is the currency of another country as Target here in the U.S. listed it at $2.99</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For an Atlantis collector, it's a decent little set to pick up and add to the fleet of vehicles for the Exploration team. It does feel a little redundant like a variant model to the other small Atlantis set 8072. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a clear difference though to the function of the models as 8072 just helps a diver manuever around and this one looks like it's also functioned to help the diver get to the seabed floor and explore around. It has a main forward light and a mini-arm holding a small light that can mover around, while the other arm holds an uncommon Lego jewel as treasure found on the bottom. Like it's meant to explore an area once it's been secured by the larger Subs.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,5

"TooMuchLEGO","2011-07-22T18:01:42.05Z","Good stocking stuffer, but not a necessity to a collection.","<p>So, after Middle School orientation a few months back, my family headed to Target. I decided that this future 7th grader needed to treat himself, so while at Target, I picked up this along with <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=30071-1"">30071-1</a>&nbsp;(<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=40841"">review!</a>), dropping around 7 dollars. Well, I put this set together in about 2 minutes. Fine building experience, nothing special though. The end result is OK, it's just a tiny sub. I do like its nice parts however- the little globe is very useful for Harry Potter fans who want to make more&nbsp;Divination&nbsp;globes, and another gem is always useful. Not to mention, the minifig's suit, flippers, and stubble covered face are amazing. Other than the parts and minifig though, there's not much here.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice parts</li><li>Great LEGO Minifigure</li><li>Good little addition to a LEGO Atlantis collection</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The head isn't exactly even- the other side of the face is a little to the side</li><li>Tad overpriced (not by much though)</li><li>End result isn't very exciting</li></ul>
<p>Overall, it's OK. If you lack Atlantis minfigures or you're looking for gems and globes, this is a nice place to get one. If you have $4 and not any Atlantis sets, pick it up- it's a great way to get the collection started.</p>",TRUE,3,5,2,2,3

"Sobel","2020-04-28T18:19:32.687Z","Well equipped, sturdy and ready for exploration!","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
This series once again demonstrates, how less than 50 pieces can still make a decent little set!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The red &quot;body&quot; is typical for this series. The big spotlight in the front is formed of some kind of transparent snow globe, a part I had never encountered before! The rest is just common parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Again, one deep-sea-explorer with the green-ish gear comes with this set. It also has the two-sided head, I refer to as &quot;Janus-head&quot;. Everyone who does not know why, go look up some roman mythology.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Of course, the build is easy, but also interesting, how the different types of holders (vertical/horizontal) are used to create a very sturdy hold for the black hangers on the side. These hangers give the sub even more stability!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This small sub has a more realistic touch to it. It looks a little like the diving scooters that we have today. The front holds a very big spotlight and two claw-arms. One holds a gem, the other holds a smaller spotlight, that can also be detached. The upper side has another arm that serves as an extension for the pilot&#39;s handle. This way, the pilot&#39;s flippers don&#39;t get in the way of the black propeller at the rear.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, this small scooter looks quite realistic. It is also very robust, especially compared to the other very small subs of this series. The design might be not so streamlined as with these other sets, but is absolutely practical. The big spotlight - I like the way it is built - is impressive and sure to make the deep blue sea a little less scary. The two arms are perfect for salvaging treasures and lighting different places. Also, the extended handle at the top is a clever design!<br />
Again, so few pieces, but a neat little sub! An enrichment for every underwater-collection!</p>

<p>The Lego Atlantis mini sub is a very well done polybag with an interesting minifigure and build .</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>The minifigure has the Atlantis helmet with green visor , a dual sided stubble face with a worried and happy expression , the torso and legs are also very nicely flowing into each other and finally he has a pair of lime green flippers . His Accessories include a megaphone torch and a yellow diamond .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build has a glass done Sept the front covering a sort of eye , there are arms to hold onto things in the sides , the top has a pair of handle bars and finally the back has a propeller for underwater propulsion .</p>

"aztecwarrior","2020-12-25T21:07:18.017Z","A Good Test Dive Into Atlantis","<p><strong>The Mini Sub&nbsp;</strong>is a very nifty little set, and a good start for any who are interested in the Atlantis. It&#39;s&nbsp;packaged in a poly bag and has 36 pieces, and its&nbsp;current price is about the same as when it was in stores, which was $4. which is a good price for the set. So, now&nbsp;that you have an overview, let&#39;s begin the details of the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;THERE is one minifigure in the set, which is the character Lance Spears. It is a decent minifig with a rather simple face that isn&#39;t theme specific, so it could be used on about any character from any them. The diving suit is very detailed with print like the trident symbol and various underwater apparatus and tubes. The headgear is a little bulky and is used on every diver in the theme. The transparent green visor clips nicely onto the helmet,</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;THE sub itself is small but sturdy, although the black robot arm&nbsp;piece could break easily. There is a transparent 1x1 round brick inside the trans clear globe piece as a diving light.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;THEN there are the jewel pieces which are a very nice touch to the little set, and it is an easy way to get these shiny gems.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So, the conclusion is that it is a overall a fun set to have and is a good choice to get if one is experimenting or testing the water it the theme of Atlantis.</p>

<p>Hope you like and find the review helpful. Good day!</p>
