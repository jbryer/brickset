<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This being my first Mini set in a rather long time I have to say I was quite impressed at the number of pieces used to build up a relatively smallish vessel from Star Wars. I can't be certain if this and the shuttle model in the LEGO Star Wars Brickmaster set are supposed to be based on similar vehicles, but I can be certain that both offer up a fun looking little Mini-Kit style model in unique and different colors. (The Brickmaster Book model is mostly red whereas this one is white.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as Mini sets go this one is a definite must own and it's great value for the money, much better than the equally priced though lower piece count Alien Ship from the Toy Story Theme that TRU is also currently selling. The Republic Attack Shuttle is perfect all around and represents the larger vehicle quite nicely, there is only one thing that this set could have used, some sort of extra clear piece to sit the shuttle on when its wings are deployed. Other than that the set is a worthy addition to your LEGO Star Wars Minis Display and it takes very little time to build as well. I might just pick up a second one of these if I see it again or possibly on sale come Boxing Week because it is definitely worth owning more than one of. I strongly suggest you try and get this little set before it vanishes off the shelf completely.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5

In my opinion this is the best of all the Star Wars minis that LEGO has ever made, it looks extremely accurate and has very nice piece usage. Lets take a brief look at the pros and cons.<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Clever usage of pieces<br></li><li>Good pieces for a great price<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I can think of no cons!</li></ul>
<p>In conclusion I think that this is an EXTREMELY good MINI set, and if you love MINI sets you should pick this up for sure!<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"wander099","2011-04-13T22:32:54.167Z","My first mini-model...","<p>So this is my first mini-model, as the title of this review states, and I should explain why I bought this.&nbsp; The only reason I bought this little ship is because a while back TRU had a deal on that if you bought two Star Wars sets, you could get 20% off (I think it was 20%, but I am not certain) your purchase.&nbsp; Needless to say, I bought this in order to knock down the price of Slave I, which I had been eying, but previously unwilling to purchase due to the expense.&nbsp; I will review that set at a later date.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>This set comes in a poly bag and with a single sheet of instructions.&nbsp; I expected the sheet of instructions, but I did not realize that it did not come with a box (as I said, this is my first mini-model).&nbsp; This was not a problem for me since while I started keeping the boxes, I do not keep the Lego inside the boxes.<h4>Parts</h4>This set had more parts than I thought it would and it had a bunch of extra bits, which I expected even less.&nbsp; But I suppose since many of the pieces are so small, they are more likely to get lost, warranting more extras.<br><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set doesn't come with any minifigures.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is pretty easy, but there are a lot of small pieces, so you will want to be careful when dumping out the bag and you will want to build on a hard surface.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The final model was bigger than I thought it would be from the pictures.&nbsp; But perhaps that is just because I have no experience with mini-models.&nbsp; The cockpit moves up and down, as do the wings.&nbsp; The wings have a significant range of motion, being able to move up and down for different poses and can be laid out flat so the model can sit securely on a shelf or desk; it can also sit with the wings up, but in my opinion it does not look as good that way.&nbsp; The model is quite detailed though and very well designed.&nbsp; I am very impressed with how good it looks for how small it is.&nbsp; Very impressed.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, I'd say if you are into mini-models or just a collector of Star Wars Lego, this one is pretty cool and not expensive, so I would advise getting it.&nbsp; It isn't a challenging build, but it looks nice on a desk or shelf and does not take up much room.&nbsp; It does have a ton of little pieces, so I would think twice about recommending it for children who are apt to lose pieces, or possibly to swallow them.&nbsp; I don't know if I'd buy another mini-model unless similar circumstances arose, but it is certainly possible if I can find one as nice as this one.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5

	I got this set at a local supermarket at regular 4 dollar price, and am impressed by how well this model was after building it.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The maroon parts on here are used excellently.</li>
	<li>
		The model looks really well done, and is amazing since it was done in so few pieces.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The red parts in this model detract from the amazing factor.</li>
	<li>
		Some guns on the cockpit would have been really nice.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This is one of the greatest mini sets I have ever built, and highly recommend you get it, unless you would rather die than get a Clone Wars set.</p>
