"HawkUnit","2010-02-27T14:06:55.937Z","Great addition to the Rebel Alliance!","<p>This is an awesome impulse set. At only $3.49, you can get 5 of these for under $20! There's lots of good parts, which can be used for other ships, as well as a good parts to dollar ( or dollar to parts) ratio. The x-wing itself is a pretty good solid design, with some pretty cool details (ex: the pair of binoculars on the rear of the x-wing). In my opinion, this is the best mini x-wing Lego has ever made! Now on to the pros and cons:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pros: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"bionic_force","2011-05-14T11:19:19.317Z","Great little freebie","<p>I picked this set up at my local WHSmiths after buying a copy of The Sun just round the corner from my house and overall am very impressed. </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>As this is my first ever Polybag set, I didn't know what to expect, but was surprised by how big the bag itself was. On the back of the bag is a random and completely pointless 1:1 scale image of one of the Round 1x1 brick, of which really serves no actual purpose. </p>
<p>After opening the bag, you come across obviouslly the pieces and a very small set of folded instructions, which at first appear to be very small, but once unfolded is a double sided A4 paper, with the cover picture and advert taking up only 1/10 over all. The instructions are very clear, but it would be nice if a Piece-Brief as I call them were included in each step.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Their is a wide selection of parts over all totalling 67 parts including spares. The pieces are all very nice and to an MOCist would be very useful, especially the Neck Bracket with Back Stud, perfect for SNOT building. The main bulk of the pieces are either Light Bluish Grey or White, with a few Tan, Dark Red and Dark Bluish Grey pieces thrown in for good measure. A few fairly new pieces such as the Flick-missile base parts are included.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Obviously, this set doesn't actually include any figures, as it isn't minifigure scale and so would just look plain stupid with a fig.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>As you would expect from a polybag set, the build isn't very complicated but is good enough to keep a TFOL and experienced builder occupied for about 5 minutes, hence the high score, despite being a tiny set, as it is better than I expected. Overall the build was fairly impressive, but not completely outstanding, as many pieces were used in unique ways.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Once fully built, the Mini X-Wing Fighter looks frankly amazing. Although not particually playable without a Mini TIE Fighter or Mini AT-ST, the set is very swooshable and with some imagination, can give even a TFOL lots of fun. It's very clear what everythings meant to be, even to someone who hasn't seen the film for several years, like myself. Just behind the cockpit their is a cleverly placed silver stud, to represent an Astromech Droid, like the famous R2-D2. The way the engines are attached is very good and the overall design is very sturdy, with the exception of the wings. It's irritatingly fiddly trying to get the wings alined and then even the slightest nudge will knock them out of place again. The guns on the lower wings could be attached with a more secure piece, as they wobble quite alot. If the wings were attached with a click system, it would be much better and easier to align them, but sadly that would probablly get rid of the engine bits.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, a great set with the inevitable hicks that every set has. As a freebie with the Saturday Sun, it came out at around 0.8 pence per piece, making it a complete bargain, even if you did lose some dignity buying the paper itself (Luckily for me, I had none anyway). It's a strong, sturdy and well designed Polybag that I would definately recommend to any fan of Star Wars or Lego.</p>
<p>Overall score: 4/5</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,5
"Huge_Nerd","2011-01-03T15:52:06.403Z","Xcellent","<p>I got this as a gift from my sister this Christmas. She said she found it in a pile of other junk at Target and had to get it for me. Lucky me! </p>
<p>This set has a lot of pieces for a baggy--over 60! I was really amazed at how a collection of relatively common pieces could come together to form such an iconic craft. It just shows that with the right know-how and imagination, anyone can make awesome little models with the pieces you already have in your Lego bin. </p>
<p>Anyway, the final product looks excellent for the size. The little silver piece representing R2-D2 is a nice touch. The articulated wings are a nice touch as well. It also looks like it would go really well with other midi scale sets.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

"Odeinoichus","2012-01-23T15:26:12.637Z","Get to Your Ships!","<p>Set #30051 X-Wing Fighter: It has been some time since LEGO made a Mini X-Wing at Retail, I picked up the first Mini X-Wing, this one shows a vast improvement to the build technique and pieces used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The X-Wing in this Polybag set is larger and more accurate compared to the original LEGO Mini Fighter, this X-Wing just looks damn impressive and a fleet of these things would look great as a display piece. The wings are also not as loose as the original Mini X-Wing due to the pieces and method used in their construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this is one of&nbsp; the definitive Mini Sets LEGO has made in the Star Wars Theme so far and much like the Republic Attack Ship it is a must own item.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"tkettle9719","2012-01-14T08:30:37.5Z","Xtra Small, Ultra Xquisite.","I got this set some time after Christmas, and got this for two dollars, plus a bit of tax. I made an excellent deal that day.<h4>Pros</h4>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-11-26T20:18:20.75Z","Perfect for the size ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The T-65 X-wing was a crucial part of rebel , new republic and resistance forces and is a crucial micro ship for Lego to make and they did it really well .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build uses a dark grey cheese slope and a 1&times;2 plate for the nose , the cockpit has tiling ontop before and dark red , white and tan on the side the cockpit uses a cheese slope for the windshield and a 1&times;1 silver stud for an astromech head , the central area of the back is grilled ontop and features an assembly with some binoculars for greebleing , the top sfoils are mirrored builds using a dark red grille for detail along with a flick missile for each cannon , the bottom wings are the same build but the dark red grille is absent and the thrusters and intakes are one build repeated four times using trans orange at the end to represent thrust .&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a very Swooshable build and packs in many key details , nothing is disproportionate and balloons good so I recommend it .</p>
