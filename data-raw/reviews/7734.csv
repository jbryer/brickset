He dosen't have any armor or a trim, and no weapon. The bike is much to hard for normal kids 11 and under. Everyone I know under 11 has messed up badly. I am 11 and yes, I did build it, but I have a lot of experience. When it is built right it is a nice bike, except for the flaming shield type thing in the front, which is unstable. I would only reccomend this to a good builder. The bike just is to big and has to little pieces.",FALSE,3,4,4,3,3

"Matroxide","2012-08-09T17:37:35.747Z","Not sturdy, Not Impressive, Not Worth Buying","This is&nbsp;one of the few Hero Factory sets that have vehicles, and the only one of them&nbsp;I got. First day&nbsp;I got it it was actualy ok, although it was not that fun to build. The only reason I rated the parts as two bricks is because it had the Bohrok head piece. They of course used cheap Easy-to-break plastic for the tecnic beams and for the cheap imitation of Furno, whom&nbsp;I did not buy as a regular set. The fireballs are a nice addition if you collect Zammor Spheres. But for just three good pieces, Not Worth It!",FALSE,1,2,1,1,1
