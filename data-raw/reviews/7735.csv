<li>The picture on the box looks good but it isn't the best set. It doesn't look as futuristic as earlier Bionicle Vehicles. You're better off spending your money on something like Von Nebula or Meltdown. 
<li>
<li>Pros: 1.&nbsp;Handle on under-carriage for easy playability. 
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Silver hero core. 
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Sits upright without support. 
<li>Cons:1. Only one gun. 
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Rocket jet is a wheel used on Thornatus.

"xtremekaxiumcycler12","2010-12-28T09:46:30.12Z","Half-price epicness","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picked this up at walmart for $25. Took about 30 minutes to build and i love it. I have only one complaint.Stickers. I really dislike those.<br/><br/>-Driver- The driver has pretty much the same build as the other heros, so there is nothing new there. But the hero core! Oh lord! it's DARK SILVER! which is completely amazing. His feet are black and sort of stick out against the light/sky blue color scheme.<br/><br/>-vehicle- Now to the main attraction, the thing we all bought this set for, the ship itself! This vehicle has a very nice design. The wings flap when you move the small triger at the bottom. The bottom clamps also move in and out when you wiggle the trigger on the bottom. The vehicle has alot of new parts that are very good for MOCing. The yellow/ black/silver/gray color scheme really works for this vehicle. The ship is almost two feet long, and i love to terrorize my cats with it.<br/><br/>-parts- Like I said earlier, this set comes with alot of rare and fun parts. But the stickers should have just been printed on.<br/><br/>-playability- This set is very fun to play with and swoosh around. Just move it in, pull the trigger and it picks up the hero canister. Hold the trigger and fly the ship to the drop site. Then release the trigger and drop the hero pod! Then wiggle the trigger and flap the wings to fly away to repeat the process!<br/><br/>-overall- Originallyi thought this set would not be very good. But now all said and done i really think it is one of the best possible vehicles. Remember, wally world has them for half price, so go pick one up as soon as possible!",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

You can also put a &nbsp;hero factory container in it, and drop it. It's called the drop ship for a reason.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,4,5,5,3
"Mandalorian","2011-04-29T12:15:31.78Z","Totally awesome","I ordered the Drop Ship from Amazon.fr (they have it cheap) on Saturday, it came yesterday. I put it together only today, however, and it's great.<br><br>It comes in a rather small square box, bigger than the Von Nebula box but not nearly as big as the Thornatus V9 box. You open the box from the top, but it doesn't work very well. So I ended up tearing a lot of it apart.Inside there are EIGHT bags with parts, two instruction booklets, a sticker sheet, a wheel, another wheel (different), and a Midak skyblaster (gunmetal!). <br><br>You tear open the bags with parts. There is one bag with big plates, a bunch of bags with beams and axles and three bags with small pieces. The parts for the pilot are, strangely, in different bags. New or interesting pieces include (within the bag): <br>Blue Crotesius helmet<br>Gunmetal Hero Core<br>4 gunmetal Kopaka wings<br>4 gunmetal Mistika Jetpacks<br>2 gunmetal Avtoran Jetpacks<br>8 big plates (2 extra big)<br>2 Small 2008 wings in Gunmetal<br>Various yellow! (not Keetorange!) pieces<br><br>Building this set took me aprox. 1,5 hours. It's a great and very enjoyable build, since you can see the progress. It is not tedious or repetitive at all. You actually find yourself closely examing the pieces before you put them on. The instruction booklets switch in a good spot, after you have finished building a piece and putting it on the ship.<br><br>After it's finished, IT'S <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">HUGE! </span>Yes, I know they say it's really big, but you don't imagine it as big as it is. It looks beautiful and glorious with it's massive armour. It's actualy quite heavy, which is always a good thing. The wings are rather small in comparison to the rest of the craft, but the jet at the rear of it makes up for it.<br><br>Playability is the best. It's extroardinarily swooshable, the Mid- I mean H4 Force Ball Shooter shoots really nicely. There are GEARS also. The mechanism enables the ship to pick up and drop Hero Pods and flap the wings simultaniously via a small trigger at the bottom. The front ""landing gear"" can be hidden or extended.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Pilot is very nice</li><li>ALL THE NEW PIECES</li><li>ARE SERIOUSLY AWESOME</li><li>HUGE</li><li>Armoured, massive and glorious</li><li>H4 Force Ball shooter is cool</li><li>Awesome jet at the back</li><li>Beautiful sleek shape</li><li>Tubes</li><li>Gear mechanisms</li><li>Picks up and drops Hero Pods</li><li>Very swooshable</li><li>A lot more <br></li></ul>Cons:<br><ul><li>Pilot's head sticks out of the cockpit a tiny bit</li><li>Front ""landing gear"" isn't perfect</li><li>Handle is a tad too small</li></ul><br>Wherever you live, whoever you are, if you don't have the Drop Ship, you absolutely must get it. I don't know how much it is elsewhere, but get it no matter what. It's worth almost anything. Currently one of my favourite sets and by far my favourite HF set.<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Gurgel","2021-08-01T02:45:51.747Z","The last Drop Ship in Brazil","<p>I know, it&#39;s not a new set. But it&#39;s big and it&#39;s fantastic!! For me it&#39;s the best set I have, even better than my <strong>42063-1 BMW R1200 GS Adventure</strong>...</p>

<p><br />
I suspect I bought the last set for sale here in Brazil. And the price was reasonable, R$300.00, considering how expensive LEGO products are here.</p>

<p><br />
From my point of view the only drawback is the pilot. It&#39;s really ugly! Not very detailed, it deserved more parts. But it&#39;s not a big deal, as my <strong>76140-1 Iron Man Mech</strong> fits perfectly in the cockpit! (see photo below)</p>

<p><br />
2 very detailed manuals, many technical parts, it gave me some ideas for MOCs&nbsp;or MODs I can do, considering the total set of parts I have....</p>

<p>Only one thing really amazes me: how until today no one has created any MOC from this excellent set???</p>

<p>Last thing: sorry, I used Google Translate as my English level is not good enough....</p>

<p>Pros:<br />
&nbsp;- BIG!!<br />
&nbsp;- Solid construction<br />
&nbsp;- fun to ride<br />
&nbsp;- good ideas for other projects</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>&nbsp;- The pilot<br />
&nbsp;- Out of catalog</p>
