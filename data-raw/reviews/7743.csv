Three cheers for the designer!<br>Too bad it doesnt available in&nbsp; my country. But since the set is easiliy built using the parts that I owned, I can easily build it.<br><br>The building proccess is quite simple and fast. It really straightforward building, so I bet any person who can see the photo of this set can build it without using any instruction.<br><br>Since me and my wive are both AFOLs, we use the set on our pre-wedding photos, along with the wedding minifigures we got from the Town Plan set. The set is look really nice in those photos.<br><br>So, for you guys out there searching for a romantic thing to give to your someone special without burdening your wallet too deep, and if your special one love Lego as well as you are, go get this set, or if you really on budget, you can try to build it from parts you own, just like what I did.<br><br>",TRUE,3,2,2,2,4

So I missed this due to circumstances. However, this year (2012), looking through current Valentine sets and seeing what had been out before, I saw this and liked it.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>I was able to find the instructions in pdf format on-line and they look like if you've got the originals, to come printed on a folded sheet of paper with LEGO's easy to follow step-by-step illustrations.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 26 pieces, many of which are basic bricks and sloped pieces in red. It's easy to find these pieces through LEGO's Pick-A-Brick feature or to possibly have them in a LEGO collection already.<br></p><h4>The Build<br></h4>This is an incredibly easy and simple build. I was able to figure out what pieces I needed from looking at the picture before finding the pdf file to confirm what pieces I'd need as I planned on ordering extra pieces so this can be a yearly decoration I place out.<h4>Summary</h4><p>Simple elegance is what describes this set to me. It is very simple and straight forward as a beautiful LEGO model to place out for a holiday decoration. I may in the future try to get more pieces so I can have more than one heart out for display.<br></p>",TRUE,5,3,2,1,3
