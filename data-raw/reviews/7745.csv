But after opening the box, I'm still quite disappointed at the design of this product. <br><br>Trace of the glue can be seen in between pedal bricks. Cheaply made leaves and wrong scale of the rose made it impossible to fit in any of the city building. <br><br>Overall, the worst Lego set I've ever seen.<br>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1

I brought 5 of these to place in our new living room they look amazing on the fire place. so if your thinking of buying one of these to play with you could do you could buy 20 and draw evil faces on them. then make a army of roses attack your city and have the toy story green army men scare them off.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,3,1,3,5
