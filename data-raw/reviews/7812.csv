<p>The set comes with cards to show different patterns that you can copy, some with blank spots for children to try and work out the pattern themselves.</p>
<p>My four year old son enjoys working with this set and challenges himself to complete the cards. </p>",TRUE,3,2,2,4,3

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>No instructions as such, but it does come with set of idea cards to get you started. The plastic insert tray in the box is frustrating, with varying sized compartments. This means you can't fit all the red tiles into one compartment, and have to spread over several.</div><div><br></div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>These Duplo tiles are the thickness of a regular Duplo brick. Later sets with Duplo tiles feature tiles with the thickness of a Duplo plate, i.e. half a brick think. Unfortunately, Brickink makes no distinction between the two widths of Duplo tile. So if you are trying to complete a set with parts, make sure you know what thickness of tile you are buying.</p><div><br></div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>No completed model as such, but unlimited designs are postal. Somehow, they all look a bit 1970s though.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A great diversion for artistically minded kids. And something different from regular Duplo building sets.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,3
