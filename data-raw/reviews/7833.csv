The Lego Dacta series was (and is) a kind of mysteris for me... good sets, but not available to the public. I guess, some of the would have sold well as regular retailer's items.<br><br>1039 is a supplemental set designed to work with 1980ies 4,5V/12V electric parts, simply everything before the 9V/electric system was introduced:<br>870 / 8700 Technic motor<br>107 Basic motor<br>970 Lighting bricks<br><br>We get 3 train remote control switches, but with special printing patters on them. You can combine them to a nice-looking control pane, and&nbsp; connect them to the 4,5V cell battery box or to the train 12V power supply.<br>Because the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=4352"">switch 4352</a> of set 8700 never really worked, this arrangement improves the situation. Now, you are able to control up to 3 motors or lighting circuit using a neat solution.<br>For obviuous reasons, it is recommended to use this arrangement only for non-mobile creations ;-)<br>",TRUE,4,5,2,4,5
