"jpeg68","2015-09-03T01:02:04.323Z","Designed for little kids, collected by adults.","<p>As part of the DACTA Educational programme, Lego produced a series of sets that were designed for (and only really available to)&nbsp;educational institutions (schools and kindergartens). It continues to produce such sets to this day.&nbsp;This set is a classic example that builds on the legacy&nbsp;of early 80s DACTA sets, 1062 vehicles&nbsp;and 1064 buildings, for example,&nbsp;and matches their simple design aesthetic. It is very rare to find boxed and complete since these sets would have had a hard time if used properly, and they were not produced in huge numbers.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>An unusual design that spreads the vehicles across a blank white space. This is purely for display purposes. This box was not for retail so it really only had to show what was inside. Nevertheless, the front has some appeal with the classic minifigures and &quot;cute&quot; vehicles driving across the blank void (not included).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside the box is divided into compartments - one for each vehicle. Instructions for each are on cardboard.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Simple sets with chunky vehicles and few fiddly or breakable parts. There isn&#39;t a huge selection of parts but an appealing array of 80s printed bricks.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>With 14 minifigs, this has plenty of people for&nbsp;the 5 year olds allowed to play with them, to share nicely...&nbsp;Classic figs with high cuteness factor.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As befitting an educational set, the builds are simple. However, it requires the builder to follow a basic cardboard instruction card, rather than easily torn and lost, step by step&nbsp;paper ones. The emphasis is on imagination and simplicity here.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Damn cute. These are almost &quot;chibi&quot; like in their style and would display well together with their nice selection of colours and a unified style across all the vehicles. Notable are the classic black and white police car (similar to the one in 1062 with the wonderful white haired, female police officer) and the yellow bus.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I felt inspired to write this review after reading the previous one. With all due respect, I think the other reviewer missed the point and ignored the context of this set. For me it is perfect as an educational set (both my 3 and 5 year olds would love to play with it &nbsp;- if they knew I had it...) and has great nostalgia value. For a collector of 80s town sets, it&#39;s a must have. Not easy to find and presumably not cheap (unless you manage to get someone selling who isn&#39;t aware of its rarity and value!), but a welcome member of my collection.</p>
