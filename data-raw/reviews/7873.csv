<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dice is nothing special compared to the dices included with most of the Lego Games. It has the same soft edge protection. Only change is the color which is golden whereas the normal dices are black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dice comes with six tiles with values printed on them. The value indication on one of the tiles is replaced by a Lego logo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, not much else to tell. If you are into the Lego Games series then it is a nice set to collect.</p>",TRUE,4,2,3,2,2
