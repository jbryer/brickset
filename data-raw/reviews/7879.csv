"bob123","2011-05-23T18:27:41.147Z","this set is worth it","<p>This is one of the rareist sets in lego history because it was not sold on lego.com. i got it from a daycare website because my mom owns a daycare and she got extra 500$ to spend on toys and she gave the rest to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall rating: this set is good, but i used the pieces to add on to my other creations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building experience: i made a custom ice cream shop out of 9/10 of the pieces and it was fun</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts: this set comes with a lot of parts and its worth it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability: you can build anyting using the parts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money:the set was more than 100$ but comes with a lot of minifigures and parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is my first review.</p>

I have a toddler who loves Duplo, and now I am looking at Lego building that is fun for me but can be saved for him when he's ready for it in a couple years.</div><div><br></div><div>After building a Creator set (Log Cabin), I decided that I wanted to buy some parts that would allow me to build designs of my own creation like I used to as a child. Somehow I came across the Lego Education City Building set, which I don't think is available through the Lego.com store. I ended up buying it from a education supplies dealer through Amazon.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a pricey set (I paid nearly 80 USD), and was almost regretting it after submitting my order, but when it arrived, I felt confident that it was a good purchase for me. I was&nbsp;pleasantly&nbsp;surprised to discover that the set comes in a sturdy plastic box (much better than the cheap Lego branded plastic containers I see at TRU) - easily worth at least a few bucks.</div><div><br></div><div>The box:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6148/5928074143_1b4360368c.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>The label:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6143/5928631736_1c27afe8ca.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>Inside, there were several large card sheets that provide suggested instructions, sample photos, and a brick inventory. Additional documents are available on the Lego Education website for ideas when using this set for educational purposes.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Opening the box:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6149/5928631792_01d90d0217.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>The card fronts:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6149/5928074305_f37056ce06.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>The card backs:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6128/5928631906_14ea43c150.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>Unlike many current Lego sets, this is not a&nbsp;sophisticated&nbsp;or restricted build. The bricks are designed to be used in many different ways, so the instructions are only suggestions rather than THE way to build.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I purchased this set because I like that it contains lots of bricks in a variety of different shapes and colours. Also, I like that it had several minifigs (good balance of male/female minifigs) and interesting accessories (at least for someone who is newly returning to Lego after a 20+ year break).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here are the bags:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6015/5928631968_1aef01a31a.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>Here are the minifig parts:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/5928632016_0d41961eee.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>Here are some of the accessories:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6134/5928074519_54a5c77246.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>And some of the interesting bricks (based on my very limited experience):</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6138/5928632144_350cb0a8e3.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>One complaint - all the male minifig faces are the same, as are all the female ones, and the female ones are the silly happy/sad dual face types which look silly when not covered up by long hair. Lego either needs to make more hats that cover up the back of minifig heads, or they need to stop printing so many dual faced heads.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My interpretation of the suggested minifigs:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6024/5928632182_6ae915ea60.jpg[/img]</div></div><div><br></div><div>I look forward to using this set to help me create Lego town sets that I can use with my Creator houses (and possibly Modular Houses - if I should decided to buy one). For now, my son (under close supervision) loves to play with my creations and then pull them apart. I don't mind because that's what this set is all about: building, not displaying.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A few buildings based on ideas from the inspiration pictures:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6026/5928632226_9265f7caf3.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>If you love building with Lego so you can make impressive models while following detailed instructions (as most sets today are), then this product is NOT for you. But if you enjoy making your own creations in free play (as I did as a child), then you&nbsp;should&nbsp;consider adding this set (and other Lego Education sets) to your brick collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4
