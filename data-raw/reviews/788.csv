"legotrainfan","2007-10-19T09:25:37.67Z","Brilliant!","Though you get four waggons and some additional things this set does not have many pieces. But the pieces you do get are great indeed! You get two train baseplates, lots of couplings, buffers, bogie plates, magnets, train wheels, and several normal plates. So even if you are not satisfied with these waggons, the set comes with enough material which you can use to build other waggons. 

You also get a truck, a little railway track maintenance vehicle, two cars, and five minifigs! All the stuff that is in this set is ideal to increase the percentage of freight transportation in your LEGO town. So stop thinking whether you should buy it or not! DO BUY IT! You won't regret it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gamlebilrokker","2021-03-26T20:44:06.453Z","A fantastic set!","<p>This is one of those J&oslash;rn Thomsen&#39;s sets that looks like it&#39;s been designed with bricks he found while going thru the dumpster in LEGO&#39;s design department. The colors are just so off, why are the tipper car&#39;s sides black, not yellow? Why is the truck&#39;s roof grey? Why are the lights fluorescent green? Why are the printed elements straight from Spyrius? What&#39;s up with the little rail car being so odd? Why isn&#39;t the one dude wearing any pants?&nbsp;</p>

<p>BUT, colors aside, this is a fantastic set, the builds are perfect, simple, sturdy, and don&#39;t repeat any builds in other sets. My kid loves it, and it&#39;s worth all the effort it takes to get this set. Highly recommended.&nbsp;</p>
