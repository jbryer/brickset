I think it would have been better to have the bunny more as a 3D set. Part wise it is an okay set. I would wait until it goes on sale more before buying them. Who knows with Easter now being a few weeks old maybe Lego will lower the price. ",FALSE,1,3,1,1,2

My wife built one, and it looked cute enough. However, the real point of buying these bunnies was that you get 84 pieces, mostly brown and tan, for next to nothing. If nothing else, I'll be able to use the brown pieces when I build a gingerbread house for Xmas. There's one thing I'm not thrilled about: some of the brown is a noticeably different shade than the rest - colour quality control apparently is still an issue. On the plus side, the bunny's eyes are just stickers. I'm usually not at all happy about stickers, but in this case they just mean that you avoid useless printed eyes.<br>",TRUE,4,4,2,1,5
