<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Lego store employee said he bought this game to use solely as parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thats what I did,to use as parts to supplement other sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most lego games are a great way to obtain parts not normally available in main line sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, if you enjoy the game by all means, play it to.</p>

I think that price is ok.</div><div>When I came home, I had to build it immediatly and play the game.</div><div><br></div><div>The first time I played it, it wasn't what I expected. Although it was fun but I thought it was game about trading and working together, which couldn't realise my expectations.</div><div><br></div><div>When I played it again, I tried out my own rules and it turned out in a great game.</div><div><br></div><div>I think that you should play the game with more than two persons. It's a game with a lot of possibilities, so try to make your own rules, it will make the game more fun.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>All I can say is that it's really worth buying. I hope you liked my first review.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
