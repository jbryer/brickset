"HQuiff","2010-02-26T14:24:23.75Z","I don't think ""A Building Experience"" is included?!","If you're a LEGO Fan, or a Kid, then I would recommend this to you, however if you are an Adult who has no experience with LEGO, don't let your Kid(s) force you into watching this.
First off, the Humor included is laden with LEGO Puns, and Jokes, not to mention the plot. Most references and Cameos are only appealing if you like, or collect, LEGO! Simple as. 

The Voice actors (And Actresses) surprised me a great deal. The Atlantis film was poor and overrated, however this is arguably a quite enjoyable film. Clutch himself doesn't put much emotion into his character, but then again there isn't much emotion in this. By far the most outstanding fellow is played by the current LEGO Owner, Kjeld Krik Kristenson (KKK), however the characters name escapes me at this moment.

Now for everyone's favourite, it's...
Pro(s):
1. Good voice acting, especially in comparison to past LEGO films.
2. True to LEGO! It uses all the principles of LEGO, often reminding you of what LEGO was always meant to be, and how it still is in some areas.
3. A lot of the puns used are actually quite funny.
4. Storyline was well-paced.
5. Good CGI
6. Great editing, and sound too.

Onto to everybody's least favourite, it's...
Con(s):
1. Clutch's voice actor lacked emotion.
2. Not an all around movie for the whole audience.
3. Tad expensive.
4. Focused too much on Castle
5. Typical Characters
6. Some if the guys were very pretentious

And there you have it! My five part review on the all new DVD Movie - Clutch Powers! Hope you enjoyed it. I recommend it to most LEGO fans, and to Kids.

"Paradoxymoron","2010-02-26T21:36:01.827Z","Great movie","<p>Personally, I really liked this movie. I found it to be a lot better than the four Bionicle movies, and I'm actually <i>hoping </i>that a sequel (which I believe will be inevitable) will be made. I also liked the puns, some of which I didn't catch until I watched it a second time with subtitles turned on (Which I recommend highly). There were a few references to Star Wars and Indiana Jones in it, along with others I probably missed.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Several themes used/shown (Castle, City, Power Miners, Agents, Mars Mission (Kind of), Space Police)</li>
    <li>Creativity with LEGO pieces is well shown. Several things are built out of them.</li>
    <li>References</li>
    <li>Puns</li>
    <li>Good story</li>
    <li>Skeletons add extra humor at points where the plot is a little more serious</li>
    <li>I personally liked the idea behind the 'creation spark'</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The minifigs' body parts fall off/rotate. I.e. Bernie spins his head around 360 degrees in one scene and Brick's hand comes off in another. I really didn't like this, but that might just be me</li>
    <li>The strength of LEGO pieces is not only overestimated but underestimated as well. I.e. The troll crashes into the giant LEGO wall without doing any damage, yet he pushes it and it falls over.</li>
    <li>Some themes used are discontinued. Hope this means that in the inevitable sequel there will be more recent themes.</li>
    <li>Once they went after the wizard, they just kind of completely forgot about the other two escaped prisoners (although, this is one of the reasons I think there will be a sequel)</li>
    <li>The line from the trailer &quot;Once again Clutch Powers single-handedly gets the job done!&quot; was not in the movie. Darn.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still trying to figure out what Clutch Powers' name might have to do with LEGO, but the other characters' names obviously are meant to be associated with LEGO. Names like Bernie Von Beam, Peg Mooring, and Brick Masterson. Also of note, are the characters named Kjeld Playwell and <b>A</b>rtie <b>Fol.</b></p>

"SgtSmash","2010-03-08T17:27:23.733Z","A fun little movie for the little Lego lover in your life","<p>I really had no intention of buying the&nbsp;Clutch Powers DVD, especially once I saw The Lego Store at the Mall Of America was selling it for $19.99 USD. However,&nbsp;Toys R' US had it on sale for $11.99,&nbsp;so on an impulse I bought it for my daughter and I to enjoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a fun little movie, with some colorful characters interacting with many current Lego themes. (Spoilers ahead) The film starts out with super-agent Clutch trying to recover a Power Crystal using the Power Miners equipment, which quickly jumps to Clutch speeding towards HQ in Lego City in the ""Turbocar Chase"" sports car from the sadly now-defunct Agents line.&nbsp;Clutch tears up the town for about 30 seconds, with several landmark City sets (Police and Fire stations, Carousel, Town Plan movie theater...etc.) visible,&nbsp;before meeting up with his&nbsp;new team consisting of 3 partners to board a Space Police spaceship,&nbsp;zipping to a prison planet to face the mastermind criminal (an evil wizard).&nbsp;Ultimately, Clutch and Co.&nbsp;help usurp the evil wizard which has taken over another world where&nbsp;a prince earns his rightful spot as king (Lego Castles sets). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film is directed at&nbsp;kids, with a few inside jokes for&nbsp;adult collectors (the&nbsp;gadget developer/mad scientist at HQ is named Artie Fol...or A.FOL for short). Brick Masterson (the&nbsp;fireman/weapons/demolition) expert is the funnest character&nbsp;IMHO.&nbsp;Clutch Powers himself&nbsp;is kind of a dud of a character, with zero personality aside from his reputation for being the greatest Lego builder of all time. The person that voices Clutch sounds like he took valium before&nbsp;phoning in his performance. I know&nbsp;children's direct-to-video films aren't supposed to have Oscar-worthy performances, but there are many parents like myself that screen or watch movies with their kids, at least make it somewhat entertaining for them too! I fell asleep after about the first 45 minutes, but my daughter has watched it about 6-7 times since, so it was worth the $11.99.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At last a Lego product that's good value for money. My six year old loves this and has watched it every day since we bought it a week ago. What's really great is that my son watches this and then goes to play with his Lego, thus taking him away from the TV for several hours.</p>

<p>I only have one issue with this film. Why release what is basically an hour and a half long commercial for Lego sets when most of the sets are no longer in&nbsp;production? I've&nbsp;managed&nbsp;to acquire one of the sets off E-bay (at an inflated price) and another from bricklink (in bits and pieces).

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-20T22:35:01.907Z","LEGO's First Official Motion Picture.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #2854298 LEGO The Adventures of Clutch Powers:</b> Before teaming up with Warner Brothers for most of their LEGO animation projects, LEGO made this little known or discussed gem with Universal. Advertised as The First LEGO Movie on DVD, The Adventures of Clutch Powers is the first of many specials and feature films to come. I feel as if there were other story ideas before Clutch Powers, but those may have just been PC Games like Island Extreme Stunts. The quality of the animation proves it is older than most series.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The front of the package showcases the titular character of Clutch Powers front and center. The rest of the main cast are also visible, do not ask me their names, I watched this a few months back and as I type the review now I recall precious little of the characters names. The back has a decent selection of shots, a good write-up on the storyline and that&rsquo;s about it. The disc does not feature any characters, no artwork at all.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This release did not include bonus Minifigures. That did not start until the first DC Feature release, so sadly there are no bonus items with the film.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The film itself is almost an hour and a half and definitely has the markings of a pilot film. Almost as if LEGO intended to make this into a series, unfortunately the plot wraps up only part of the storyline. I&rsquo;m not sure if LEGO online ever featured any further adventures, but the story kind of ends a bit on a stalled ending. The basic premise is that three of the LEGO world&rsquo;s worst villains have escaped and Clutch Powers and his team needs to work together to recapture them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Spoilers, they don&rsquo;t get along very well. In point of fact this plot is pretty standard fare. Once they manage to thwart and capture one of the villains, the others are still at large. Overall it&rsquo;s a decent film, quite entertaining, and as a bonus there is an extra small short included which features some of the characters.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The animation is quite dated, considering it is now 10 years old that is to be expected. The storyline features some ideas that did not return, and others that were referenced in other LEGO projects, I&rsquo;m pretty certain Ninjago, The LEGO Movie and even some of the Bionicle/Hero Factory stories featured some references to major ideas introduced here. The term master building or master builder was mentioned in passing here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A pretty decent and engaging piece of LEGO media history with this item. The fact that there aren&rsquo;t a lot of bonus materials to watch or enjoy along with it does mean that you don&rsquo;t get a whole lot to do after watching the film. Would I recommend this film? Hard to say, if you can find it and want to see LEGO&rsquo;s first feature at a good price, it is worth tracking down. If you&rsquo;d prefer to ignore the character then it is safely skippable. So somewhat recommended.</p>
