"Pepper","2010-10-31T20:38:28.237Z","very expensive","<p>This is a good set to get if you don't want to spend $150 to get these figures. They are very nice figures, although Palpatine is kinda creepy. (He has greenish color above his eyebrows!) $15 is really expensive for 3 figs and 3 magnets. I picked it up on sale for $10, so it wasn't as much of a rip-off. ($10 is&nbsp;still<em> </em>pricey though)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>pros: 
<li>rare minifigs for cheap (kinda) 
<li>shoulder cape&nbsp;thing that Palpatine has 
<li>Nute Gunray's hat 
<li>another Rodian 
<li>accurate Clone Wars representations</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>cons: 
<li>really expensive 
<li>Palpatine looks creepy 
<li></li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is a really good way&nbsp;to get these figures if you missed out on the sets they came in. It is really expensive, but if you find it on sale and you missed these figures, this is a must-buy. But if you can only get it for $15, then I would tell you to spend the extra money to get the sets or buy something more worth your money (like another Clone BP, you can never have too many of them).</p>",TRUE,3,5,1,5,2
"fff","2010-12-29T09:27:57.933Z","rare SW minifigures... nothing more - nothing less","Well this is simple, 3 minifigs from SW. Pricey? Maybe, but within a year, this will not be pricey at all.<br>All of them are rare minifigs. So, if you want them this is the best way to get them instead of buying the sets... but you knew this already... :-)<br><br>If you still not convinced let me tell you the pants are not very common (dark red, sand green...), the torsos are quite unique i guess, and the faces, very rare ones, all 3 ones.<br><br>No cons, no pros, ... really easy<br><br>...and this is the last year the minifig magnets can be detached (as they should be...)<br>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,4
