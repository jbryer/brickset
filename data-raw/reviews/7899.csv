You can buy this set and then sell the other two figures for the price of this set giving you free ewok!&nbsp; The ewok minifigure is the same as the one you get in the Battle Of Endor set. The other figures are made of the cheap plastic rather than the stuff you get in the big sets. This is the case for most of the magnet sets.",FALSE,5,5,1,4,5
"mvila09","2011-02-23T13:05:53.717Z","This magnet set is worth buying!","<p>This Star Wars magnet set is worth the buy. I would say that if you probably cannot purchase the Battle of Endor set, then you can purchase this. It includes Han Solo, Scout Trooper, and a redesigned Ewok which are minifigures that appear in the Battle of Endor set.&nbsp;I recommend this set to anyone, because it includes hard to get figures (excluding Han Solo) at a small price.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,5
