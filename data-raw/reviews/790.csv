"Johnbronze","2009-09-13T12:21:20.53Z","Blast from the past"," Please forgive the pun, but this was a pretty cool set, although it might not be appealing to those who were not around when this came out in '97. Like most Technic sets from the time, the car's primary color is red with other black & stone-grey parts. 

 Like the title says, when you pulled back the completed car (not hard at all to build by the way), it did go pretty fast. I am crediting the speed of this car to Lego's ""rubber/cloth stretchy-bands"" rather than those pull-back motors that they have now *shudder*. Although, the rubber/cloth bands would cause some friction once and a while, causing the car to immediately stop without notice, then you had to play mechanic with it a bit and see what happened. 

 Another issue with this set is that it is so light. You need to hold it with two hands (one on the front and vice versa) so you could launch it correctly. Doing otherwise (like the kid in the picture) could cause the car to just fly off (i am serious, that thing went FAST), leaving the spoiler in your hand.

"jdlucas","2010-08-04T17:49:11.083Z","Great Beginner Set","<p>This was my first Technic set, and an excellent introduction it was.&nbsp; Small, easy to assemble, a good variety of pieces, and excellent playability.&nbsp; As johnbronze said, this thing is FAST.&nbsp; Way better than most of the later pullback motors.&nbsp; Not only that, the entire pullback mechanism is brick-built, the only specialized pieces being the elastic band and the spool.&nbsp; The ratcheting gears are a great idea.&nbsp; They engage when you pull it back, and for a few split seconds as the elastic unwinds.&nbsp; Then they disengage so that the elastic doesn't wind back up and stop the car.&nbsp; The light weight of the car makes for crazy-quick acceleration and good range.&nbsp; Sometimes you can even get it to pop a wheelie like in the picture.</p>
<p>The alternate model deserves mention.&nbsp; Having an alternate at all for a set this size is unusual, much less one that is as good as the main.&nbsp; The alternate is a top-launching device.&nbsp; You make 2 tops using the wheels, a 6L axle and a 16t gear.&nbsp; When you stick the top into the launcher, the 16t gear engages with the gear on the launcher.&nbsp; Then you turn the top to wind up the elastic.&nbsp; There is a ratchet to keep the top from unwinding until you push a button, which releases the elastic and makes the top spin very fast and come out of the launcher.&nbsp; It launches the tops with much greater velocity than you could get with your fingers, or even with a launcher with a ripcord.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it takes too long to wind up the second top to make them battle.</p>
<p>Being a $7 set, it doesn't come with a whole lot of parts.&nbsp; Only one Technic brick (although it is a 16L).&nbsp; It doesn't have a great price/piece ratio, either, but playability more than makes up for it.&nbsp; It's not like you're going to be buying this for parts, anyway.&nbsp; It does, however, come with a good assortment of studless parts, for 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is may be a set worth getting two of, if playability is what you're going for.&nbsp; Maybe <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=8205-1"">8205 Bungee Blaster</a>, which is exactly the same, but yellow.&nbsp; That way you can race the dragsters, or wind up two tops ahead of time and do top battles.&nbsp; <br />
