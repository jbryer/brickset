There is little else to say about the figure - he is also available in 8036 Separatists' Shuttle, and the&nbsp;852844 Star Wars&nbsp;Magnet set.</DIV>
<DIV>The figure's head is the same mould as Greedo - but in Green, with blue eyes. The figure parts are attached to each other permanently, as with other key chains. It's a neat way of getting a rare figure, but it's not easy to remove the chain without damaging the minifig.</DIV>",FALSE,4,4,4,2,4
