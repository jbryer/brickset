<p>The legs are fixed to the upper part of the body so they can&#39;t get away, the wings are fixed (no unfolding/rotation), and the front part of the helmet does not exist, so you can touch the head.</p>

<p>The screw into the helmet is very solid, so if you wanted to use it as a keyring, well you could.</p>

<p>The legs are standard LEGO legs, which are mobile, the hands and arms (they can do their normla movement).</p>

<p>There is a stud in the back (not shown on photo). The head can rotate slightly on (its) right side, but not to the left side.</p>
