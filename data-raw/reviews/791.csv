What i was thinking was, that with a few modifications, it could be a statue in the town square. just need's some kind of simple mount, or foundation if you will. Of course you might have a much better idea yourself, but it's a suggestion anyway. You could also use it as a duck in your town lake. A mutant duck, that's bigger than the people, but who cares, it's Lego, it's not exactly realistic. :)

Where this small set really shines, is in it's simplicity. Anyone can put this together, it's the perfect set to introduce your young child to the wonders of Lego. Another plus is, that anyone can tell what it's supposed to be. A young child would love this set. Just be carefull they don't put the pieces in there mouth. I would almost think, that a child could put it together just by looking at the picture. In fact, i don't even think it came with a set guide, but i really can't remember axactly.

I think i got my copy in a Mac Donalds Happymeal, but i'm not sure, it's many years ago.

Anyway, it's a great set if you have a young child that doesn't know the joys of Lego. it might not be the biggest set in the archives, but it reflects perfectly what Lego should be, a fun time, and it has limitless possibilities, just use your imagination. :)
