The item number included on the March store calendar is 852856, code 4610386. I wonder if that means you can use the item number for an online purchase?",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"michaelvader","2010-03-13T16:49:50.217Z","MAX!","<p>&nbsp;The day has come when lego made a Max minifig! So if you have read my other key chain reviews you might know that I cut off the key chain part to make it a minifig, And that is what I did to Max. Ok I am going to make the review based on the parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hair: This is the best piece of all, the brand new lego Max hair piece! I really like all the detail they put into this piece. ( If you take the key chain thing off it will make a hole in there but you can not see it from the front which is good). Overall: 5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Head: Ah never forget about the head. NEVER! Any way they could have made a better head I mean come on, That could be a girl head if you look at it close. But its OK. Overall: 4/5<br/></p>
<p>Torso: THE ONE AND ONLY MAX TEE-SHIRT IS HERE! (lol) As you can probably tell I REALLY like the shirt. There is not much to say <SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">Though </SPAN>so Overall: 5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legs: They are tan legs with the Max&nbsp;<SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"">Pockets</SPAN> on the side thats all. Overall: 5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall with this set I have to give it a 5/5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! Oh and I picked a 1 brick for buliding experience because there is no building experience.</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,4
