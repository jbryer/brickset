But this Power Miner is cool, because he:<br><br><ul><li>-is from Power Miners, a theme with nice vehicles</li><li>-is complete with metal (like your keys!)</li><li>-has the nearly the same visor like the men from Ice Planet 2002, a nostalgic factor, but I have already lost it, it must be fixed like all the other pieces<br></li><li>-is part of a theme by Lego, no license-stuff-also looks like a robot without a human face-can be compared with Lego City, my favorite theme which has no cool key chains</li></ul>",TRUE,4,1,1,3,3
