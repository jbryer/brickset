"collectormom","2010-02-28T18:52:02.2Z","Pretty cool case","Just got 2 of these at the Lego store for $14.99 each. The case itself is a heavy cardboard with a plastic handle and magnet latch on the side. The 4x6 plate in each slot comes out and will hold at most 3 minifigs if you put 2 facing forward and one sideways.

For younger kids I'm not sure how durable the heavy cardboard will be over time but for AFOL I think it's great.

If they were $9.99 I would have bought 3 or 4, $14.99 seems a bit pricey but I got one each for my kids",FALSE,5,5,5,5,3
"Nesquik","2010-09-15T08:13:50.99Z","Essential addition","LEGO have finally provided a way of displaying your favorite Minifigures without them getting lost or dusty. The product in question is #852820, the 'Minifigure Collectors Box' that is available from both the LEGO Shop website and official LEGO stores.<div><br></div><div>Despite only being made of what seems to be a very thick (or at least strong card), its surprisingly durable and friendly to look at. The carrying handle is a nice feature and, with that being made of good plastic, is the strongest part of the product. I think the quality control is a little lacking as I found bits of stray card cuttings on the edges, but nothing major.</div><div><br></div><div>There are 15 compartments, and each compartment can hold 1 or 2 Minifigures facing forward comfortably, though if you're stuck for space, you may be able to add a third on its side. The space is adequate and all of my 'figures have fitted in no problem except for just one, which is also annoyingly my rarest! The 'Nesquik Bunny' Minifigure from the 1990's is too tall to fit in whilst standing upright because of its super long ears, so you'll need to bend it down a lot.</div><div><br></div><div>In terms of value, it's actually not bad although I would imagine the cost would soon mount up if you have a lot of Minifigures. This suggests to me that, in the future, LEGO could devise a method of buying more 'compartments' for some kind of large platform on which the 'figures could be displayed... Who knows!</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, a well worthy purchase and makes my Minifigures really stand out. I always get visitors to the house asking where I got it from, and they're not even LEGO fans!</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,3,4
"AETerry","2011-01-14T17:20:18.057Z","Minifig Display Box Review","<p>This review is based upon the fact that this item is an accessory for storing and displaying minifigures in, whether they be from specific sets, customs or the Minifigure Collection series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a little pricy I think for the display box, but you get a stand to place the minifigure on in each of the 16 different compartments that can also be slid out and back in. But we're also looking at it being an official LEGO product, a magnet hold on the side and cover so it stays closed and it really is well made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get at least one if you can. Buy more as you're able to, to house your best and favorite minifigures in.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5
