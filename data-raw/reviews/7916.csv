<p>awesome white ninja,good&nbsp;for collecting&nbsp;female figs,cool forestwoman.</p>
<p>cons</p>
<p>a bit to expensive.</p>
<p>I think this&nbsp;is a great set and reccomand it to all collectors and minifig lovers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"welz","2010-12-13T19:17:33.117Z","Decent Figs, a tad overpriced.","this set was&nbsp;kinda expensive, but then again all these figs are vintage: and the white ninja is very uncommon and awesome looking!.. it seems that most people buy this for the ninja and the green female pirate!

"Nesquik","2011-03-19T11:08:05.663Z","Collection 5 - a ladies affair!","<div>This the first all-female Vintage Minifigure Collection, which I think makes the product all the more interesting as the male minifigures obviously dominate a lot of sets. For Volume 5, we get a broad selection of themes - the highlights for me being the 1980 'Nurse' and the 1990 'Forest Woman', which are both extremely rare in their own right, and contain some really nice details. In particular, the 'Nurse' has a hair mould that hasn't been seen in donkeys years!</div><div><br></div><div>The 'Flight Attendant' from 1994 makes a welcome return and I think would make a great addition to anyones Lego City, particular as she has been included in so few sets. I'm less keen on the 1999 'Ninja' and the 2002 'Film Star', only because their themes were rather short lived, and the 'Film Star' in particular has few details that are unique to the Lego Studios theme, looking more like a casually dressed lady (aside from the LEGO emblem on her back).</div><div><br></div><div>Build quality lacking a bit in places. I've read from numerous sources that these Vintage Collections are produced in China for some batches, and if this is the case, it may explain some anomalies such as warped legs different plastics. The artwork/detail however is immaculate.</div><div><br></div><div>Volume 5 is a nice addition, particularly as it makes a change from the constant 'Spacemen' in previous sets. But to really appreciate some of the figures, you may have needed to been around when they were released, as although they hold sentimental value for myself, they are may not be as 'exciting' as those found in other sets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Bring on Volume 6!</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
"Berrus_Brickus","2011-01-10T15:17:02.733Z","""Minifigures, Remade 'Collection 5'""- Would have worked much better","<p>Let's get right on with it-</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>*Ninja Princess 
<li>*Even though I have no forestmen (except the CM one), I find that the forest woman goes well with pirates 
<li>*Nurse's hairpiece, glad that they still have access to this mold 
<li>*""Girl Power"" 
<li>*All different faces 
<li>*Pippin's (the actress's)&nbsp;face is more vibrant than I remember</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>*Chinese Plastic 
<li>*Pippin's torso isn't acurate; She appeared in this getup in two sets, one was a polybag where she had a red pony tail and backprinting that read <em>LEGO, </em>the other had a brown pony tale and non back-printed torso, this one has printing on the back. 
<li>*Forest woman looks to (forgive me for this) to curvy.&nbsp; However, this is a problem with the original figure. 
<li>*Not actually vintage, remakes 
<li>*Kind of expensive, but at least you know what you're getting</li></ul>
<p>In conclusion, I really don't know what to tell you on the idea of getting this, as they are all very different and accurate (except Pippin's printing), yet they are chinese made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Berrybrick's Tips</h4>
<p><strong>How to determine if a figure is Chinese:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; On a normal Danish minifigure (try a jedi or a police officer), remove the head and you should see a little area that is painted, it is usually black, but I have seen silver and white.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, on a chinese made one, the paint will be missing (try it with a CM or a VM).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The only exception is on a blank torso because of having no actual front or back. </p>",TRUE,3,4,1,3,3
