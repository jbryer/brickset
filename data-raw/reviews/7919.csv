The set is promotional and origionally brought out only in Germany, advantage of a set this size you always can collect the parts and make it yourself but I wanted the real thing. Its a nice set with a Dragon Knight and a fierce attack cart, not spectacular but good enough for 4 bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : Nothing really difficult, the cart is a bit like its predecessors so easy to built. The cart with weapons is very realistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : A set filled with usefull parts, a lot of weapons, a torch and a good minifigure. Simply very good for a small set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 bricks : Standing alone not much fun, but these kind of sets are there to add to your other sets and then it has sufficient playing value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks : hard to say since it never was for sale and Bricklink shows no used estimate for this set yet. I&nbsp;bought it for&nbsp;â‚¬8,00 including sending, in my opinion a reasonable price for a MISB set of this size which hasn't been for sale. The average MISB price on Bricklink is the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
