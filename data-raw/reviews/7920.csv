"AETerry","2011-01-04T00:25:01.92Z","Target Practice","This isn't a bad little set, even as an impluse buy. For it's price it's well worth it, granted that you don't mind going after a bunch of accessories.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>There's a new Kingdoms Minifigure featuring one of those new domed helmets with brims. He happens to be sporting a brown crossbow for a fairly innovative target that doesn't rely on an older printed element piece to provide a Target set up.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>There's a little campfire with cooking chicken leg. Which seems to becoming a standard feature of some sets. 2 silver spears, box they rest in.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The clever part for me with the size of this set is the tree design and the apples in the branches. Inspiration now for how to go about building an orchard anyone?<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Harmonious_Building","2011-04-26T19:39:50.78Z","Compact set with cool pieces.","This small set has everything that you could want from a set of this size: an uncommon Minifig, a load of accessories, and a couple of unique pieces to boot. If your crossbow knight gets sick of the lack of challenge involved in hitting a target that's twice the size of himself, he can try and see if he can knock down any of the apples hanging in the tree behind the target. All of this plus a rectangular container that doesn't seem to come with Castle sets too often and a small campfire, just in case your crossbow knight has to camp out in the dark somewhere to bump off an enemy or two.<div><br></div><div>I'm personally partial to crossbow knights, so I like this set a lot. It certainly goes well with the King's Castle of the Kingdoms line, where just two crossbowmen have the job of defending the entire perimeter. That's less than one per wall!</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-12-24T22:17:16Z","Target Practice","<p>I was kinda shocked when I looked at my collection and discovered this was my first Castle set. Anyhow, this is a good starter set or stocking stuffer.</p><p>The minifigure included is great. While I had seen the type of helm the figure wears before, I was still surprised to see it in real life. It's chrome and it's detailed pretty nicely. The torso is double sided, and the quiver and crossbow look as great as ever. The head tells me this figure enjoys life and loves his job. A great figure.</p><p>The actual set is pretty neat. It has a target similar to the one in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=2516-1"">2516</a>, but is mounted next to the tree, not free as in the Ninja set. Now speaking of the tree, it's not fantastic, but it gets the job done and it's pretty cute looking. There are also apples on the tree, which is enough to justify a purchase right away. There is also a crate with two spears in it. I'm not sure why it's included, but it's a nice little addition. Finally, there is also a fire with a drumstick. It's not my favorite, as I find it kinda ugly, but hey, archers get hungry. He's gotta eat!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Apples!</li><li>Cheap</li><li>Nice starter to a Castle collection</li><li>Many neat parts</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Fire could have been done better.</li></ul><div>This LEGO set is a great way to start a Castle collection. With a nice assortment of parts, a great minifigure, and nice models, this is a great impulse set. I plan to get more Castle sets in the future. This one drew me in, and I want more!</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,2,4

<li>Target is sturdy 
<li>Free</li></ul>

<p>This is a great addition to any Kingdoms Collection.If you can find it seperatley than buy it. -Thanks for reading.</p>",TRUE,4,5,2,4,5
"BeardedCastleGuy","2012-01-17T19:48:32.443Z","Like many Castle Polybags that came before it, this set delievers the goods.","<p>The 30062 Target Practice continues a tradition of having a small, affordable set that is Fantastic for Army building.&nbsp; It comes nice selection of parts for the target and the tree, and while the campfire may be slightly lackluster it's still better than not having one at all.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Minifigure that looks good amassed in numbers.</li><li>Nice Accessories, crossbow, quiver and the pair of spears.</li><li>Food!<br></li><li>Nice target design.</li><li>Affordable price (MSRP)<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Limited availability.</li><li>Would have liked a shield included as well.<br></li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>The addition of even one copy of 30062 can help add some variety to any sized collection.&nbsp; The activities the varies sub models add can diversify a small setup or add some flavor to a larger one with cluster of minifigures near either the campfire (Dinner!) or doing archery practice at the target.&nbsp; I was happy with the first bunch I scored, even happier when they returned slightly cheaper in the Christmas section as a stocking stuffer, I doubled the quantity I bought and even now wonder if I should have hunted down even more...<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
