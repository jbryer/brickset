Since there's only 5 pieces, no instruction, and it's completely built when you get it I didn't rate the 'Building experience' category. I gave the 'Parts' category five stars because 3/5 pieces are chrome. I didn't rate the 'Playability' category since there's only a Stormtrooper in this. For value of money, I gave it five stars because it was free. It would be nice if the blaster was chrome to go with the Chrome Stormtrooper, and this goes really well with the Chrome Darth Vader (duh).

"pod120","2011-01-22T06:44:11.123Z","The Only TRU Product That Wasn't Overpriced","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got this set for free at TRU for spend over one hundred dollars AUD on LEGO. You may have had to of spend more or less than that, but it was an amount that was probably somewhere between one hundred and one hundred and fifty dollars AUD. This review is going to be very personal, as opinions about this LEGO set, or better named as LEGO product will differ greatly between different people. There will be people who like this novelty very much,"" It's a great little minifig that will probably hold a lot of value and as an individual figure, cannot be made any better"". There will also be people who think that it is terrible,""It's just a boring old minifig, everyone has got a Stormtrooper"". I can't say&nbsp;I have a lot of&nbsp;experience with the minifig, as I am yet to open the packet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigure is technically the only thing included other than&nbsp;the blaster and the packaging. There&nbsp;isn't even an instruction&nbsp;leaflet. The minifig&nbsp;was already&nbsp;mostly constructed in the packet when I got it.&nbsp;I am unsure if the pieces are detachable or if the head, torso and legs are permanently stuck together. Only his helmet and blaster were loose. I have divided the explainantion of the minifig into four parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-The head</strong> is the same part as most minifig heads. It is a standard black and doesn't appear to be special or unique in any way. As I have not opened the packet, I do not know if the head can be removed from the torso. Being a single colour may not appear as a positive for some people. Some people may have wanted for the head to have detail, but has there ever been a Stormtrooper minifig without a black head?</p>
<p><strong>-The torso</strong> is rather detailed and is a very shiny chrome silver. The silver is infact so shiny that sometimes the pieces almost look transparent. Other than printings, the hands are the only part of the torso that is not silver. The torso has printing on both sides. Most of the printing is surrounded by a shade of white, which gives more detail to the minifig. All of the printings on the torso are either a black, white or grey colour. From what I can see, it appears that the arms are moveable.</p>
<p><strong>-The legs</strong> are the same, shiny chrome silver as the torso. The legs do not have any printing at all. I wonder if LEGO's method of colouring the minifig, or even just its legs was by use of spraying paint. I thought this after seeing the inside of the legs. One leg was painted silver on the inside and the&nbsp;other was left white on the inside. It is questionable whether this was or wasn't intentional and whether or not this is a positive. The legs seem to move very easily from what I can do with the packet still sealed. I am unsure if they can be detached from the torso.</p>
<p><strong>-The helmet</strong> is probably the most interesting piece of the set. It is the same chrome silver as the torso and legs. When I got the packet, the helmet was already loose, but may have initially been connected to the minifig's head. I do know that Stormtrooper helmets commonly pop off of minifigs' heads which they have been placed on. The shape is good and I believe it is the same piece as the original Stormtrooper helmet. The printings are very detailed and are made up of black, grey and and dark blue colours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Accessory</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other LEGO piece included is the blaster. It is a standard blaster seen in the Star Wars line and I believe the piece was first seen in 2007, along with a similar piece which was slightly longer. The piece has a complex mould and will go for a long time before it will&nbsp;seem outdated. The blaster has three points at which it can be clasped in the minifig's hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Packaging</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wouldn't normally mention anything about the packaging or instructions in a review, but because this LEGO product is so small,&nbsp;I will give a brief&nbsp;explaination of the packaging. The big ""Star Wars"" is in red and has the same design as mid 2009 and early 2010 The Clone Wars sets with the three Clone Troopers design. The information bar states that&nbsp;the set&nbsp;is intended for peoples aged 6+, the official name is ""Stormtrooper"" and that the set, or product contains 5 pieces. The LEGO Star Wars website address&nbsp;is also displayed. The back&nbsp;pretty much only&nbsp;has common packaging details such as choking hazard, recycling symbol and barcode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in the end it is up to you whether this set is a positive or negative. It would be impossible for everyone to agree on where the set, or product lies between a rating of one and five. I think that as a promotional bonus, the set is everything it needs to be. It is detailed, it includes an accessory, it is an iconic licensed character and it is a colour that is rarely seen in LEGO. When it comes to building and playing, it is difficult to judge this product, but should it be judged on these things? It's technically not even a LEGO ""set"". Is it a good LEGO product?&nbsp;Has anyone ever written so many words for only five pieces? All of these questions' answers&nbsp;ultimately remain with you.</p>

"Phantom","2010-12-20T06:13:12.4Z","Looks better in the packet!","There isnt too much too say about this minifigure, its a stormtrooper but chrome!<br/>When you first see this figure, you notice its very shiny and has a very reflective surface but there is however a con.<br/>Certain parts of the trooper in the 'chroming' process were skipped out, mainly the back of the arms which gives this 'special' guy a cheap feeling.<br/>The parts are very good, offering you a range of minifig bits in chrome so you can take this guy apart and use his parts to make a custom.<br/>I got 2 of these free from TRU with the purchase of Battle of Endor and Count Dooku's solar sailer.<br/>Generally the minifigure is best kept in the packet as it looks much better but i probably may have opened one of them up if i didnt have an already opened one from the magnet set.<br/>The printing also seems to be much cheaper as my 'rough' one has lost nearly all his torso printing just from staying in my minifigure box! The chrome is however pretty hard wearing and not easy to scratch or maybe you cant print as good on chrome?<br/>Overall this guy is pretty cool to have but dont go too crazy as its just a shiny stormtrooper!",TRUE,4,5,1,5,5

"tfcrafter","2013-02-20T17:18:15.893Z","Not bad","<p>I got this minifig as part of a promotion by TRU Canada in 2011, where you spend over $40 on Lego Star Wars stuff and you would get this VERY SHINY minifig.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Pretty simple, your standard polybag with a blown-up picture of the chrometrooper. Very shiny.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Nothing special, comes with a blaster, your standard minifig mold.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Well, this is where it gets special. The chrome minifigure is stunning from a distance (I almost blinded myself because the sun was reflecting off the paint). However, when you go up close and move the limbs, you will see white plastic (the original stormtrooper colour). This may take away from the whole ""chrominess"" of the minifigure, but I assure you, it is quite worth it (better than that useless TC-14 who got 2 minutes of screen time). Very shiny though.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Um...fun?? I mean, it's like your standard minifigure build. Except more shiny. Very shiny.</p><p><b>Results</b></p><p>Is it worth it? Sure. You can find it for less than $30 on Ebay. Is it essential to your collection? Well, unless you're a minifigure completist, it isn't that important for your collection. I would recommend saving your money and buying something else instead.</p>
