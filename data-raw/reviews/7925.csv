"Tim_Johnson","2012-07-28T07:13:58.86Z","Unusual for a Game and some great parts","<h4>Parts</h4><div>Unique to this set is the 2x2 tile with the Classic Space logo. Sadly it appears on a half blue/half red background, but still incredibly cool. Plus, you get 3 of them. The microfigs also are unique and fantastic; a blue and a red Space guy. Can't wait to build a ship for one of them.</div><div><br></div><div>If Classic Space nostalgia is not your thing, maybe you'd like some 1x3x2 bricks with curved tops - in <b>dark blue</b> and <b>dark red</b>? This is the only set with those colours and there are two included of each. They look very smart!</div><div><br></div><div>In terms of parts costs on BrickLink, the 16x32 dark blay baseplate is obviously a stand-out winner. Of the&nbsp;remaining&nbsp;top ten most expensive parts, aside from those mentioned already, are various Technic liftarms, a round 4x4 brick and two round 1x1 brick with fins.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I was happy to have five peal gold Zamor spheres, and a couple of beautiful dark red and dark blue 1x8 tiles. There are eight 1x6 bricks in white - no great thrills, but that's a good quantity for a small set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Build</h4><div>For a game, I enjoyed this build. The first part is making the various micro space stations and satellites, white with trans blue or red. They're cute considering they're just a few parts. Then you build the 'pinball' board which is very ordinary stuff but has a smart look. The final section is the clever Technic stand to angle the board, but also collapses so everything fits into the box (just!) with no disassembly. I can imagine younger kids finding this part tricky - it is&nbsp;unwieldy to handle as you build and&nbsp;requires concentration to get the liftarms in the right spots. Lots of model rotation going on in the instructions.</div><div><br></div><h4>Play</h4><div>This is unusual for LEGO Games in that it is not a 'board' style of game. Zamor spheres are rolled down the board, bouncing off the 'space stations' and 'satellites' which you can place&nbsp;strategically&nbsp;during gameplay so that the balls land in your hole at the bottom. This aspect is the most fun of the game and it takes a while to be able to anticipate how the balls react to the obstacles and the studs on the board.&nbsp;Another thing I really like about the game is that this makes the <b>studs</b>&nbsp;very much part of the game's focus, plus the Space guys move one stud up the board each time you win a ball. (The microfigs are just score markers, they're not part of gameplay.)</div><div><br></div><div>There's a massive drawback to the game though; the Zamor spheres often get stuck due to the obstacles and studs. This is incorporated into the game's rules, and does become an exciting factor as you can sometimes get to release the balls or knock them out with another ball and score 2 points! But if you have to apply or remove another obstacle to the board when a ball is stuck somewhere else, it's hard <i>not </i>to dislodge the ball and I can imagine many childhood arguments resulting! The other drawback is that it can not be played by more than two.</div><div><br></div><h4>Summary</h4><div>I wouldn't pay RRP, but if you can get it for at least 40% off it's great value. It is unlike other LEGO Games I've bought. Essentially I'll give the same advice I always give for LEGO Games - if you like enough of the parts, it's a great parts pack.</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,2
