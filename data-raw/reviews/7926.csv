"parchioso","2010-08-30T08:46:45.2Z","Not Superb but still inline with the brickmaster tradition ","<p>Perhaps due to the nature of the theme the brickmaster atlantis has heavy emphasis on vehicle but rather limited focus on structure, comparing to the pirates and Castle brickmaster, the book content is less appealing too. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts list has no big surprises, from the set you got Bobby Buoy and a Manta Warrior. Although many of the models are too simple and dull, I need to say that there are also interesting ones, such as the explorer Submarine, it must be fun to be maneuvering such real underwater vehicle in the deep ocean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional models available online: <a href=""http://atlantis.lego.com/downloads"">http://atlantis.lego.com/downloads</a> , but I can only locate the PDF for Drum Sub and evil bug only, and the DK site seems require username/password for access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is worth recommending if the pricing is right, I notice very big variation among local vendors, the typical price seems to be lower than the listed price though. But IMHO, Brickmaster book allows building a rich variety of models out of a small set of parts, and this exhibits the lego spirit thoroughly, so personally I would collect all Brickmasters, this Atlantis set may not be surprisingly good, but I would not feel bad about it either.</p>

"AETerry","2010-10-03T09:52:10.16Z","DK Atlantis Brickmaster Book Review","<div class=""description""><p>This is the first such book from DK that 
I've bought. I saw the Castle, Pirates and Star Wars Brickmaster Books for sale at the 
time and settled on this one.</p>

<p>Mainly, as I'm going after the Atlantis theme currently and looking at
 the books for Star Wars &amp; Castle, it felt tedious to buy a book for
 a theme I'm not into or feel I already have many numerous similiar 
model sets already. Pirates I may buy later if I see it.</p></div>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>If you're so inclined, what's really nice about this book set is that the front cover of the book serves as the storage box for all the bricks and the instructions are printed on the pages of the book in LEGO's clear step-by-step illustrations with instructions for fourteen different models and the inclusion of additional information for the Atlantis theme.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>According to the bookset, there's over a 140 pieces. And that's a decent number of parts for making all the different models and designs. Not all the pieces will be used in every model, but it's clear there are plenty to work with.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get two Atlantis minifigures in this set. The first is Bobby Buoy from the Dive Team and the other is a Manta Ray Warrior. As a fan of the Atlantis theme, my favorite is the Manta Ray Warrior.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed models</h4>You've instructions for building several models and sets in this book. All of which are good and when you get tired of playing with one, you can build another. Most though cater to a scenario and little adventure theme between Bobby Buoy and the Manta Ray Warrior.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Trying to bare in mind the age group this is intended for... this is a
 great little book &amp; lego set offering a variety of different models
 and builds to make. It's a good number of pieces and minifigs with the 
book for the price.</p>

<p>And I enjoyed putting it together.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

"IAmWillGibson","2011-04-19T11:50:19.53Z","Upon reflection, this is a fine kit","I was perhaps a little regretful about this Brickmaster set when I first got it. The cost seemed high, made worse by the generally unfair inflation Canadians have to pay for books, but when I saw it on sale I took the plunge. The parts are nice enough, but it seemed you're really paying for the fancy book, which, all things considered, was a bit of a nuisance, really, because it's bulky and hard to keep open. The benefit, of course, is that this set is Creator-like, and has multiple models to encourage re-building, something most LEGO lines have pretty much forgotten about. So there's a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">big </span>plus right there.<br><br>But... the downside is that most of the alternate models were somewhat... uninspired. Too many slight variations on pretty much the same thing. So I was left feeling a little blas√©. <br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">BUT,</span> now that I've had the set for a while, and have had it disassembled for most of that time, I've re-assembled it yet again and come to the conclusion that the Hammerhead Shark and Explorer Sub build [the main build, as it's on the cover and uses all the parts] is probably one of the best Atlantis designs I've seen. The shark is small but pretty perfect, and the sub is really unique among the line, as it's one of the few [perhaps only] vehicles in this mid-scale that actually looks like a proper exploratory sub, while still maintaining enough of the retro-futuristic Atlantis styling to fit in with the other vehicles. Dare I say it's sort of fundamental to the Atlantis fleet.<br><br>Plus, another Manta guy. And Manta guys rule.<br>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,3
