It's simply one of the best looking LEGO helicopters of all time, the lines are perfect! It's also very sturdy and swooshable, and the wheels and the opening doors add hours of playability to a very simple little set, that's also very easy to build.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"T79","2018-01-29T12:17:03.797Z","One of the first Lego helicopters - still one of the best?","<p>This is another one of those old sets which must have come as hand-me-downs as it is from before I was even born and I never had the instructions, so it probably came already built (for however long that lasted anyway ;-).</p>

<p>Considering there&#39;s only 62 parts it&#39;s a rather large model, the two 4 x 12 plates and the 2 x 10 brick certainly help with that. And even though it is basically a rectangular box on wheels with a protrusion for the tail it manages to look rather good, no mean feat as there are only 5 sloped bricks and a windscreen! Take out the wheels, the doors and the rotor assemblies and you are left with more than half of the parts which are all bog-standard bricks and plates. Speaking of that windscreen, I wonder why that was made? I don&#39;t have mine anymore but replaced it with a transparent 2 x 4 sloped brick for no apparent ill effect, and this windscreen apparently only appeared in two sets so did this really warrant a special part?</p>

<p>Just recently I dug it up from a bag of half-built sets and it was one of the easiest to fix as only the rotors and tail wing were missing. Queue leaving the room for a while and when I came back my eldest (8) was already enjoying himself with it: a surprisingly big cargo hold and real doors captivated his interest, things which aren&#39;t found on any of the other helicopters we have (#31003 Red Rotors probably comes closest) so despite its age and simplicity it&#39;s not a write-off yet.</p>

<p>So, good: doors for the cargo hold, nice shaping overall and of the nose (for just one sloped part + windscreen!) in particular, and long rotor blades, some later helicopters look rather ridiculous with really small main rotors (#6462 Aerial Recovery, I&#39;m looking at you!).</p>

<p>Bad: the connection between tail and fuselage could do with a few slopes too, I don&#39;t know why Lego chose to picture the set from the rear as it&#39;s definitely not the best angle?</p>
