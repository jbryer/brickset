Took less than a minute to build.&nbsp;I only have two poly-bag sets: this and a creator Christmas tree. The only point to this set is to boost your minifig count I guess... It's still pretty cool.</p>

"wildwill","2010-07-26T22:54:29.257Z","At last a way to army build the little green men somewhat cheaply","<p>I just found these hanging on an end-cap at my local TRU and snatched one up for $3.99. &nbsp;I would imagine that these won't last very long at retail.</p>
<p>Of course this is an &quot;impulse&quot; kit and as such doesn't really contain a whole lot of pieces, but the primary model is quite cute and functional. &nbsp;The ship itself is swooshable and the color scheme works rather well, you can definitely tell it's a toy story ship, heck it looks a lot like a mini-version of Buzz's big ship.</p>
<p>The real prize here though is the Alien Mini-Fig, which up until now had only appeared in the expensive Toy Story sets that I couldn't afford, and he is spectacular. &nbsp;OK I didn't realize that the smaller mini-figs didn't have articulated legs, so I was a bit sad to discover that, but what can you do? &nbsp;The alien head is the best part of the set and I'm sure it would look great on any custom fig.</p>
<p><b>PROS</b>: ALIEN MINI FIG! &nbsp;Swooshable Mini-Space Ship. &nbsp;Quick and easy build.</p>
<p><b>CONS</b>: VERY small pieces, low piece-count for the price. &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

<p>I never thought the day would come that the LGMs would go cheap. This is the only Toy Story Promo so far that is accessible to North American Shoppers. It retails approx $3.99 at ToysRUs.</p>
<p>Building Experience: Not much to expect here. It's a promo.</p>
<p>Parts: This set has a nice assortment of parts, in a nice variety of colors. Greens, reds, and blues really bring out the look and feel of Buzz Lightyear and co. The Little Green Aliens, who were previously available in the Construct-A-Buzz and Zurg sets, are the pilots of these miniships. This is a great way to attain multiple aliens!</p>
<p>Playability: Not much, but a nice swooshable ship. Many younger fans will find this set enjoyable.</p>
<p>Value for Money: For $3.99, this set seems a little more overpriced than most promos, mainly because of TRU's overpricing MSRP policy. It's still a nice way to attain some nicely colored parts and the elusive Green Aliens.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: This is a set that requires little thought on purchasing or not. It's a great way to introduce yourself to the Toy Story theme or build a MOC of the famous Claw Scene.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,3
"United_Bricks","2011-09-01T12:43:38.117Z","The minfig","This set came out as a promotional In the&nbsp;UK&nbsp;with&nbsp;banana's, You had to buy three packs of banana's to get this and pay for P&amp;P to send it. This set is small but cute, I mange to get my hands on two, because of the awesome alien. The best part in the set I would say would be the alien, but I will tell you why later.<div><br></div><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; "">THE MINIFIGURE</span></h4><p>The only minifig in the set is the alien. The alien is a nice collectors item, It has nice rare pieces on him. The first piece is the head, it is&nbsp;different from normal lego heads&nbsp;because it is in the shape of the toy story alien. The head is light green, he has three eyes and a little&nbsp;antenna what comes up from his head. The next piece is the torso, it is blue and it is double sided. On the front their is a little picture of a planet with a ring around it. He has light green hands which I would say are hard to come by.&nbsp;Finely the last piece is the legs, the legs are blue like the torso, they are short so they are rare to. Overall 5/5</p><p><br></p><h4>The ship</h4><p>Well the ship is ok,&nbsp;properly the best part for me in the ship is this light green 1x1 plate which has a knob sticking out of it which you can &nbsp;attach things to it (I'm not sure what you call them) you get two of them, but that was my&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;piece because it was rare to me&nbsp;because&nbsp;of the colour . The ship is basic but has good&nbsp;variety&nbsp;of colours. 2/5</p><p><br></p><h4>Overall&nbsp;</h4><p>I hope I&nbsp;didn't bore you, I would&nbsp;defiantly get this set&nbsp;especially&nbsp;if you are a toy story fan.

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-15T11:47:57.283Z","Little Green Man","<p>Set #30070 Alien Space Ship: This is a polybagged Impulse set from Toy Story and unfortunately there really isn't anything spectacular about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh sure the model is a nifty looking little space ship to build, and the Mini-Figure is a real gem since this is the cheapest method of getting LGMs from LEGO Toy Story, I was thrilled to finally pick one up, but I just wish it was priced a bit more fairly. There is nothing wrong with this set, it isn't meant to be a WOW type of set, but at 5$ CND it does seem to be a tad on the expensive side for a mere 29 pieces. I was hoping TRU would drop it down to 2.86 like they did last year for the Creator Christmas Tree and Snowman sets that were in abundance, but they didn't, oh well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a great source for LGMs, but other than that you can easily skip this set in your LEGO Toy Story collection if you already have an abundance of them from other sets they are in. The colors of the pieces are good though and dare I say it, but the LGMs would fit in quite nicely with Classic LEGO Space sets, their logo is almost identical to the Classic LEGO Spaceman logo.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
