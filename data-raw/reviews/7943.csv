<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Since I never have seen&nbsp;them, I won&#39;t comment on them.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Just as with #383 Truck with Excavator, lots of wheels. I wasn&#39;t too fond of the red crane piece: it never seemed to fit my lego minifig world (of course, it&#39;s not made for minifig scale but little did I know back then). It does have four blue arches which were used in building houses or classic space bases so not all was lost.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p><em>Very</em> simple, but then again you are just building some very square vehicles so it&#39;s no wonder. It still has some old-school charm to it though.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The tow truck didn&#39;t really convince me, the size seems ok but then the tow&nbsp;crane doesn&#39;t really match the scale either. Now it looks like the tow truck is too long, but if you shorten it to match the tow crane it looks too short. I do like the cab which is&nbsp;one stud&nbsp;longer than the cab on #383 and looks better for it. The car is ok, the hood is very long so you can imagine it as some type of convertible sports car and it&#39;s nice in blue and black.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Standing next to #383, the children went with that one practically every time. In fact, most used in this set was the car, and that was to zoom it around and have it end up on the trailer of #383. The tow truck hasn&#39;t seen much use at all, though they also have some smaller tow trucks and they weren&#39;t used much either so maybe it&#39;s not their area of interest (yet).</p>

<p>Again, at the time of writing this one is going on BrickLink for at least &euro;25 so really for collectors. If I were to buy one set&nbsp;between #382 and #383 it would definitely be #383 and not this one though.</p>
