(This is my first review, so sorry if it isn&#39;t great.)</p>

<p>Box/Instructions: The box opens from the top, and the illustrations show you the set and how you can play with it. The instructions aren&#39;t very detailed but shows you what you need to know to build the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: The parts are pretty average, even for 1973. It has two wheel parts and a propeller part. It also has a few stickered and printed parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: This set was before minifigs. So, none.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: Like i said, the instructions aren&#39;t the best, but the build is still easy. The large red cross stickers on the ambulance and helicopter overlap some of the bricks, which makes it kinda hard to take the model completely apart, but it still looks good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model: I really like the look of the set. The helis tail could have a bit more support because it falls of easily. The ambulance is very solid and cannot fall apart without enough force, except the little 1x1 tile at the top. That falls off super easy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion: So, the question is: should you get this set? Its a great mini wheel set, and a good small car set in general. Its also a good 70s set. I say get it if you like 70s sets and small vehicle sets.</p>
