<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set was not bad. As was with <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=20003-1"">http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=20003-1</a>&nbsp;(Creator BM), this was a gift from a friend who gets Brickmaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Building</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building didn't take long. There were no difficult parts, considering this set only has about 60 pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Basic Evaluation</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ""one-dot"" green &amp; white&nbsp;shingles and&nbsp;red&nbsp;""one-dot slicks"" are handy for if you are one of those people who have those mosaic sets. Back on the green shingles, they are a nice trick to making the rough skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Detailed (but short) Evaluation</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beige and brown pieces aren't a realistic underbelly color in my opinion. I guess LEGO didn't want to have to make a whole new color for the ""two-dot"" clip for the hinge of the back of the tail, but I have no clue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A decent set. It can be used for many things such as it eating minifigs in your lego movies! :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4/5</p>

The jaws are moveable so it has some kind of playability . The magazine it comes with also includes alternate instrucions to build into a frog. I would definatly recomend it but, unfortunatly it is Brickmaster exlusive.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-02-11T17:27:09.357Z","Crocodile Rock","This cute little crocodile was a very fun build. Its mouth can open and close, and its tail can move up and down. The legs cannot do this however, but it's quite alright. There are a lot of nifty little pieces in here- such as a lot of green (obviously). The light green scale pieces are my favorite- they are hard to come by and this set comes with quite a few. My sister enjoys this product a lot- she pretends it is my pet crocodile and sometimes he's a zoo animal. Overall it's a great set and everyone will love it, big or small. Not sure if the real crocodiles will though. ;-)",FALSE,5,4,4,4,5
