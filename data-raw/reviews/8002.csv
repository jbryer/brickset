"brixton","2010-05-29T07:04:14.717Z","Impressive","I love the collectible mini-figure collection that Lego has released.&nbsp; The Tribal Hunter is all decked out in his ""traditional"" attire and comes with a bow and arrow and two feather head pieces.&nbsp; The colour scheme for the clothing is great.&nbsp; My only real complaint with this mini-figure is the bow part of the set.&nbsp; It fits awkwardly into the Tribal Hunter's hand and it tilted to the right.&nbsp; I do not think he can hold it straight.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Firox_5000","2010-08-21T18:41:30.8Z","Nice little Indian","<p>This figure is part of the series 1 minifig collection. He has 7 pieces and takes no longer than two minutes to build. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure has a sort of happy face with blue and red printing to give him an indian look. His chest and legs have a&nbsp; stripy print on them giving him which is very nicely done. He also has a not bad head piece which has long indian plats going down with a small atachable feather piece which can be attached on top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set also includes the classic arrow and arrow storage pieces which are also included in the forestman of the series too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set&nbsp; has a fare playability in a western and forest setting and could go well as a counter part to the cowboy or mexican in series 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recomend him , I would describe him as one of the mediocre figures in this series. The figure is now sold out in the shops so you can probably only get him in ebay now.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,2

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got this minifig over a month ago, back at the end of April. This minifigure is one of my many favourites from Series 1, with its bow and arrow and new torso and leg printing. Although, it has lots of good points, there are also some bad ones:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>A&nbsp;typical traditional red indian hair</li>
<li>Feathers in its hair, is a nice touch</li>
<li>Accurately detailed bow and arrow and quiver</li>
<li>Accurately designed face, has red indian face painting</li>
<li>New torso and leg prinitng have high detail</li>
<li>Comes with spare head feathers</li></ul>

The tribal hunter comes with a Native American hairpiece with decorated white feathers. The head is a yellow face with a very happy looking smile and face paint on the cheekbones. The torso is tan with beads and a blue and white pattern. The legs are tan as well, but with more blue and white patterns. The figure also comes with a bow and quiver. I give this set a 4/5 because it should have had a bit more detail, maybe on the arms, though.<br>",TRUE,4,3,2,3,4

It`s got a nice body design including a zig-zag pattern on his torso and some facepaint on his cheeks. However,&nbsp;the accessories had already appeared in the discontinued Western theme. If you own the Tribal Hunter, Cowboy (Series 1) and&nbsp;the Mexican (Series 2) ,you could make an&nbsp;brilliant western scene!</p>

"sideswinger","2020-07-09T01:47:02.08Z","A pretty good figure!","<p>So the Tribal Hunter is the first figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1, and while he isn&#39;t my favorite of the series, he definitely isn&#39;t my least favorite either. He was also only 2 bucks though, so it isn&#39;t exactly top-notch, but still, it is a nice figure. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>So on top we have that hair, with really looks nice or this figure. I really like how the strands hang down in front of his torso, and it is just a very nice hair piece all around. I originally thought it was new for the figure but it was first introduced in an old LEGO Western theme, so it isn&#39;t new, but it still works for the figure. And as you can see, he has that feather attachment on top, which looks great with the black printing on the tips.</p>

<p>Next we have his head, which has a nice face print. I like his big smile and eyebrows, and he also has those red and black lines on either side of his face, which make him look very indian-like. And the face is not double-sided, but that&#39;s okay because it was only 2 dollars.</p>

<p>And then his torso has some nice printing as well, with that blue beaded necklace, as well as the feathers that hang down from it, and I like the bad printing on his waist, which looks great. And I&#39;m not positive on this, but I don&#39;t think he has back torso printing, which again, is okay since it was only 2 bucks.</p>

<p>And then he does have some really intricate printing on the top of the legs with that blue and white design, and he has some other printing on the legs as well with the lines by his nees and all.</p>

<p>And his accesories are cool as well, with that brown quiver, and then he also has the brown bow as well, which were not new, but still; they look very nice, and go right along with the rest of the figure.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for this guy! Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it!</p>
