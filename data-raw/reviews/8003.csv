VERY Rare<br></li><li>She's got a defined short skirt AND knee socks</li><li>Nice girly shape on a rectangular torso -- painted well, I thought.</li></ul><ul><li>CONS:</li><li>Yellow (skin tone) paint on the blue torso looks kinda weird</li><li>Stripe of yellow (skin tone) on legs continues on side, looking bizarre</li><li>Hand plastic color doesn't match arm plastic color.</li></ul>However, the best thing about the figure is the pom-pom, which is a really interesting piece in its own right.&nbsp; It's made kind of like a head, with the cavity underneath, but inside the cavity is an offset stick that can be grasped by the figure's hand.&nbsp; Also there is a small opening on the side of each pom-pom, which keeps its side from interfering with the figure's arm.&nbsp; it's an ingenious and interesting shape, and I think it could be a very useful piece for lots of imaginative MOCs.<br>",TRUE,4,2,2,2,5

"absolutelylez","2010-06-08T11:33:40.247Z","An excellent figure from Series 1","This figure is quite simply excellent.<br><br>Parts:<br>The pom poms are very interesting and well designed. to put them on the girl's hands, they must be slid down from above: there is not enough room to click the hands in like you would normally. This is done on purpose to make it seem as if the pom pom covers the hands entirely. <br><br>The hair piece is a nice blonde colour and is obviously unique. Blonde hair on yellow lego skin seems however a bit strange.<br><br>Printing:<br>On the pom poms, the printing is very nicely done to seem quite irregular and authentic.<br>The legs are quite unique in the fact that there is printing on the sides of the legs. I am however confused why there is no blue stripe on the sides also, though.<br><br>The mouth on the face is a bit odd, it gives the impression the girl is gritting her teeth.<br><br>Overall: get this one!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got this minifig over a month ago, back at the end of April. This minifigure is&nbsp;my&nbsp;second favourite from Series 1, with its pom poms and new torso and leg printing. Practically everything is perfect about this minifigure:</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new colour for the hairpiece, this means it fits the look of the figure perfectly</li>
<li>New pom pom pieces, in the same colours as the torso and lego designs, blue and white</li>
<li>New torso printing, of a very realistic cheerleader vest</li>
<li>New leg printing, on the front and sides, this makes the legs look&nbsp;very like a cheerleader skirt&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price is a bit too high for my liking, <SPAN lang=EN-GB style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"">£1.99, I would have prefered <SPAN lang=EN-GB style=""FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"">£1.49 or 99p</SPAN></SPAN></li>

"LEGOParadise","2010-08-31T09:43:24.05Z","Go,Lego,Go!","<p>The Cheerleader is great minifigure as it includes cool elements and printing. Her pom-poms are very unique and will definitely not appear in any other set. The printing on her legs is made to look like she is wearing a skirt. Also, unlike other minifigures, her skirt continues around the side of her legs. On her top, there is a big ""M"" proberly for minifigure. Her face is a bit... strange. It looks like she`s in some kind of pain! The hair colour&nbsp;(which is blonde) goes very well with her outfit. Overall, i would give it 4/5 if you have a lego football stadium or a school the cheerleader would&nbsp;fit in&nbsp;very well!</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
"sideswinger","2020-07-14T01:57:48.63Z","A very cool figure!","<p>So as the second figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1, this is a surprisingly great figure. And since she was also only two bucks, the detail is nice. So let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>Up top we have that pony tail piece in yellow, which is not a color I have personally seen too often, so that&#39;s cool, and I think the piece fits the figure very nicely. I like that long pony tail hanging down below her torso, and I also like those strands hanging down on either sides of her head, so that&#39;s cool. Just a very nice hair piece for the figure.</p>

<p>And then we have her face, which has an okay print. I like her eyes, but that smile just looks odd. It looks more like a grimace to me, but oh well. And of course, no alternate face because she was a two dollar figure.</p>

<p>And then we have her torso, which has some great printing on it. I like that bit of flesh, as well as that nice big letter in the middle. Then she has those yellow arms as well, with no printing. And again, she has no back torso printing which is to be expected from a two buck figure.</p>

<p>And then she has some very interesting printing on her legs, which is very complex for 2010. I like tat yellow skin on her legs, and then she even has some side leg printing, which is really cool for two bucks. Just some very nice leg printing in all.</p>

<p>And finally she has those two pom poms, which were new pieces for this series. And again, very detailed for 2010. I love the blue printing on top because it is all caste in white. And it has some really great and very complex moulding on it, so bravo on that.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for this figure! And while she isn&#39;t one of my top favorites of Series 1, she&#39;s definitely not one of my least favorites either. Thanks for reading!</p>
