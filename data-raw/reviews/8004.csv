"absolutelylez","2010-05-15T08:00:39.047Z","A worth addition to your jungle","The caveman is one of the better figures of the first series, but is not the best.Good points:All elements are unique. The design of his torso and legs is convincing, and the printing itself is of high quality. The head itself has a cheeky grin and very thick eyebrows - and could be used quite easily to make other characters. The head is appropriately hairy, and reminiscent of Hagrid's head in the HP series.Bad points:The plastic is lower quality, this isn't particularly noticeable until you feel the hair and club.",FALSE,5,5,3,3,3

"hewman","2010-06-07T22:52:10.467Z","Dirt club","<p>Firstly the positives for this set, nice design with the printing with the bone and chest hair, interesting monobrow.</p>
<p>Although not brilliant, the plastic quality of the fig is acceptable although a little rubbery in the hair/beard piece.</p>
<p>What really lets this set down is the club, this could be an absolutely brilliant piece except for the quality. It is an exceptionally dull brown and looks like a very used piece of lego (in fact worse than many of my 20 year old minifig accessories). Rather than being shiny plastic it looks more like the caveman has molded the club himself out of dirt.</p>
<p>Bottom line is it's a good looking figure, but don't expect the normal lego quality or you will be disappointed.</p>

"bogdanst","2010-05-30T13:27:03.75Z","One of the best minifigs","Well, this guy is just great. Apart from not scoring high on ""building experience"" because... let's be honest - it is just a minifig - his hair piece and club are just a ""must have"" for any fantasy castle MOC. And even if you wouldn't use it in a MOC, he is so detailed, he will look great on any shelf.<br>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5
"Orthobotrex","2010-08-25T07:38:21.267Z","Me... Caveman!","<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, this figure looks great. But then again, the quality of the plastic puts it down (pliable).</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course, the print looks great but looks like it could be rubbed off easily! Nice to look at, and&nbsp;I should say is a good represantation of a caveman though it does not&nbsp;command a well deserved yabba-dabba-doo!&nbsp;Your kid will surely love this, but discerning AFOLs may want more from it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,3
"Carl","2010-12-25T18:43:21.013Z","Caveman","In my opinion, the caveman is a very cool minifig. His beard is a nice piece and his torso is very detailed. And his club is awesome! I'm no expert but I don't think they had plastic back in the caveman days <b>hewman</b>, so I really don't think it's a fair comment to say that the club looks hand-made. It probably would've been. Anway, the playability is hugely lacking as this 'set' consists of only a minifig and this is the same reason the building experience is dropped down. I have rated the value for money 5/5 simply based on the price I got it for, which was free (I got all the series 1 and 2 minifigs for Christmas). Overall this is a neat minifig, but if you don't like realistic clubs, then don't get it.",FALSE,5,4,3,2,5

<p>The Caveman comes with a Boulder mallet which is a nice touch but yet is disapoingly smaller&nbsp; than first thought. The headpiece is not bad. The chest and torso have a detailed tunic style print on .</p>

"The_Reviewer","2011-07-23T12:27:34.197Z","Caveman Reviewer","<p>The caveman is one of my favorite Series 1 minifigs.He comes with a hairpiece that looks shaggy,unkept and messy,a head piece with two eyebrows,two normal eyes,and a large grin.His Torso has printing that looks like aninmal skin cothes with a bone inside a pocket and leg printing of the same clothing.lastly he comes with a Club;smaller than other clubs even though other people hate that;I like it,it looks more in the right scale.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hairpiece is unique 
<li>Club is smaller (it looks more in the right scale) 
<li>leg printing</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>No back printing

"sideswinger","2020-07-21T21:29:51.07Z","A great figure!","<p>So the third figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1 is the Caveman, and he is an awesome figure, and one of my top favorites in the series. I just really love the overall design of this dude and everything. So let&#39;s get a closer look because don&#39;t get me wrong, he has a few flaws...</p>

<p>So on top we have that hair/beard combo, which looks splendid. I love the moulding on it, and I love just how bushy it is. It kind of reminds me of Hagrid from 2010 and 2011&#39;s beard. It&#39;s just a very cool piece that I haven&#39;t seen out of the setting too much. It was included in the LEGO City 60200 City Capital set, and also the promotional minifigure 2-pack, which included a Caveman and Cavewoman. But we&#39;ll talk about that later.</p>

<p>Then we have his face, which does look a little strange to me. I like his big chipper smile, but that unibrow just looks sort of off to me. I just think it looks pretty strange. And he has no alternate face which is to be expected from a two dollar figure.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso, which has some really nice printing. I like the bone, the hair peeking through, as well as the black spots on it. And he has no arm printing, unfortunately. And he has no back torso printing either, which is pretty sad, but oh well.</p>

<p>And then the legs is where the flaws come. While he has some pretty nice front printing, he seriously lacks side leg printing, and it really hurts too. I wish they had dual-moulded legs back then, but they did not, so it looks really bad. I just think they could&#39;ve at least done some printing on the sides.</p>

<p>And then his club accessory is a pretty cool piece. While it isn&#39;t a very rare piece to get with a CMF, it&#39;s still a great part to get with the figure. I just love the shaping of it, and I love how it looks with the figure. So all cool there.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for the pieces! Overall, I think it&#39;s one of the best in Series 1, and I like it overall. But here&#39;s the thing. in 2017 a LEGO Minifigure 2 pack had basically this same figure, as well as a remake of the Series 5 Cavewoman. And while I think the CMF Cavewoman was better, the Caveman included is better than this one. It has great coloring on the sides of the legs, and is just basically the same exact figure with darker coloring on the torso and legs. So while this is is a good figure, the 2017 version was a lot better in my opinion.</p>

<p>And I think that wraps up this review! So thanks for reading!</p>
