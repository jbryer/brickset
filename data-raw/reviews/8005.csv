"Jason_LEGO","2010-06-06T23:55:30.903Z","Poor Quality","This is the first&nbsp;collectible&nbsp;minifig from this series I purchased. I wanted to buy one to see what they were like before I bought the whole collection. Thanks to Brickset I was able to choose the one I wanted with the&nbsp;bar-codes&nbsp;provided. Right after opening the package I realized the quality of these things was inferior to other minifigs and not up to par to the rendered pictures supplied from Lego. I am hesitant to purchase any more based on the quality of this one minifig. The colors are not as bright and saturated as the pictures, the plastic feels much cheaper and lighter and the printing on the fig is not very sharp or&nbsp;accurate. I would gladly pay double for a higher quality fig. Lego is one of the very few toys left that has a higher quality standard, however this seems to be changing. This one&nbsp;clearly&nbsp;is made 100% in China and it shows.",FALSE,2,3,2,2,2
"Orthobotrex","2010-08-25T07:23:14.64Z","Hmmmm...","     This is one of my most anticipated minifig of the collectable series. The prints are not smudgy although they appear inferior to the other prints of LEGO minifigs, which look embedded into the plastic. But the headpiece is a plus, though I can see mold lines in them.
     What put me off was the horn. I have two of these, and one of them can't grip the horn as well as the other. On close inspection, it was wider at the section were it's supposed to be held. I was afraid to force it for I might break the hand. Also, the plastic appears somewhat pliable for both the horn and the minifg itself.
    It's pleasing to look at but do be careful with the print and the hand if the horn is too big for it.

The horn was of poor quality because I could see the molding lines. Also the horn felt like rubber overall I would give this set a 3 because of it's poor quality.",FALSE,3,2,4,5,2
"Kamex","2010-08-05T12:43:04.66Z","Who's Laughing?","<p>A friend and I decided to &nbsp;buy a&nbsp;collectible&nbsp;mini figure each to see what they were like. Hence, this was the first set out of the&nbsp;collectible&nbsp;mini figures that I bought. The figure was&nbsp;chosen&nbsp;at random.</p>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Not a great deal to say about the figure&nbsp;really. At first I was excited, seeing as this is the only clown mini figure that I know of. The excitement soon wore off however.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>As soon as you hold the plastic you can&nbsp;feel&nbsp;the figure is not the same quality as the figures that are included in other Lego sets. The horn is&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;bad, with mold line everywhere which are very&nbsp;noticeable. The torso, face &nbsp;and legs are nicely printed, and are&nbsp;unusual&nbsp;pieces, so&nbsp;theses&nbsp;will certainly appeal to some collectors. The hair is also a nice&nbsp;price,&nbsp;although&nbsp;it is so big,&nbsp;every time&nbsp;you try to rotate the figures head, the hair just&nbsp;rotates&nbsp;instead (although this may be&nbsp;because&nbsp;the head/neck was stiff on my figure).</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Overall, purely a novelty item. Its perhaps one of the most interesting mini figures of the series, but&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;not worth &pound;2.00, when you can buy say, the small city car for &pound;3.50.</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,2,2
"Carl","2010-12-25T18:48:43.213Z","Circus Clown","The Circus Clown is a very cool minifig. He features a new horn piece and a red version of the afro/wig which appears only in this set and the Disco Dude, where it is black, from Series 2. His torso and legs are colourful and bright, and LEGO has captured the spirit of the clown perfectly in terms of the face. The playability and building experience drop of course simply because it is only a minifig, and I have only given it 5/5 for value for money because I got the entire series 1 and 2 for Christmas, thus getting the Clown for free. Overall this is a very cool minifig, and I would recommend him to most LEGO fans.",FALSE,5,5,3,3,5

"LEGOParadise","2010-08-31T15:22:28.467Z","A little bit funny","<p>The Clown minifigure is good and bad. Heres why: The printing on the clown is quite colourfull and detailed with patches, buttons and a bow tie. His hair and his horn are both new elements however the horn has some uneven colouring which is clearly visible. Also it would look much better if the Clown could hold the horn by the bulb as if he is hooting it. You can make a circus if you own the Clown, the Magician (Series 1) and the Ring Master (Series 2). Overall, I would not recommend this set unless you want to make a circus!</p>

"Berrus_Brickus","2011-01-25T19:13:16.77Z","Just a step closer to my Ronald. . . .","<p><strong>I won't be offended if you skip the intro, and get onto the reveiw.&nbsp; If anything, I'll be relieved.</strong></p>
<p>Well, there I was in Toys 'R' Us, I decided to purchase just one minifigure that day (as I had already speant enough at Target earlier that day), the one I wanted more&nbsp;than anything, <strong>The Clown.</strong> I had the end of his bar code memorized.&nbsp; After tearing between one of two boxes, I found it (,or at least what I thought it was).&nbsp; After opening it, I found a nurse.&nbsp; Apparantly there are two barcodes on the bag. . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, though the nurse was a nice figure but not what I wanted.&nbsp; You may or may not be able to imagine the disappointment, anyway I got over it.&nbsp; But then, I recieved the little creep for Christmas, what a great gift.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>So now onto somthing one may care about.&nbsp; All of the <em>Series 1 </em>minifigures come in the same sealed, yellow polybag.&nbsp; The instructions are just a little flyer showing how the put a figure together with a generic, yellow LEGO person.&nbsp; On the reverse side there is a checklist showing all 16 of the <em>Series 1 </em>figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>Note: I only know what the Box/Instructions are like because of owning the nurse, you should understand upon reading <strong>The Build.</strong></em></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>What is there here that is not to love?&nbsp; We score an exclusive Red 'fro, a clown face, a lime green torso with white marks, a big red bowtie, and light blue suspenders.&nbsp; The clown's legs are basic red hips, a red leg with a light blue patch, and a blue legs with&nbsp;a red patch.&nbsp; The little creeper is accesorised with an exclusive&nbsp;gold horn (I would of prefered a knife, but oh well).&nbsp; Also icluded is a black collctor's stand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only have two complaints,</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Chinese Plastic 
<li>2. I would of prefered if the head was all white, but that's an opinion</li></ul>
<h4>Minifigure(s)</h4>
<p>See Parts</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>I actually didn't build this, he was assembled in the&nbsp;box.&nbsp; But I can tell you from building the nurse, it is considerbly less enjoyable than standard LEGO figures, as chinese minis are stiff.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>See Photo, y'all get a pretty good view of him from there.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>For the very low price of $2.00, you get a clown, somthing we haven't seen in <strong>SYSTEM </strong>before, not counting <em>Batman's Joker.</em>&nbsp; For me, it is just a step closer to me being able to make a custom Ronald McDonald.&nbsp; All I need is a better clown face.&nbsp; (Ominous tone) <em>And I know what the future brings, skater boyII/ surfer girl all over again. . . .</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As someone who is afraid of Clowns, (especially Ronald McDonald) in a comical way, I must say that this was not <strong><em>a </em></strong>musthave but <em><strong>the</strong>&nbsp;Series 1</em> musthave.&nbsp; Though, be warned, I have been drawn to less popular/wanted figures, like the Racecar Driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Included Custom Torso</h4>
<p><em>I don't expect anybody to use this torso, I have it here for my own personal reference.&nbsp; Please do not mark this review as unhelpful because of it.&nbsp; Thank You.</em></p>

Bricky the Clown.","<p>Set #8683 Circus Clown: I got him with my second Nurse and I was actually glad to see him, although the Circus Clown isn't on my must have list for Series 1 I definitely don't scoff owning him. Every good City display can use a clown or two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His unique hairpiece and fun looking horn accessory are pretty nifty looking and the printing on this guy is really fun. If you're looking to get a lot of unique mini-figures then you can't go wrong with the new Collectible Mini-Figures and there's nothing more unique than a circus clown. Perhaps LEGO will make a new set next year for the CITY theme that can go with him. A miniature Circus tent or something the size of the Farm, with camels and elephants and new LEGO lions and tigers... Yeah that'd really enahnce this little dude, but if they don't at least we have a Circus Clown to lighten the moods of the LEGO City Citizens.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,5

"sideswinger","2020-07-22T18:14:03.987Z","An amazing figure!","<p>So the Circus Clown was the fourth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1, and for 2010 this is an incredible figure. I just love the pieces and prints and everything about him. So let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting at the top, he has this really amazing hair piece. It&#39;s just an incredible piece overall. I love how poofy it is, as well as the elaborate moulding all over it. And it looks great in red as well. The piece was new for the figure too, which makes it a lot cooler, and for 2010 it looks great. It does appear more with future CMF&#39;s, but never in red, so that&#39;s cool.</p>

<p>And next is his face, which looks cool. I love that big smile, with the white makeup and all, and then he also has those big painted white eyes. But of course, the best bit is his big red clown nose. It&#39;s just very necessary for a clowning figure. No alternate face on him though, which is to be expected from a two dollar figure.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso&nbsp;which looks sweet. I love how colorful it is. You have that red bow tie up top&nbsp;with the white polka dots on it, and then he has those blue straps on him as well which look neat. And then he also has those white polka dots under those straps. It&#39;s just a pretty complex design. And no back torso printing either.</p>

<p>And his legs are next, and I like how they&#39;re two different colors, with the red and blue. Then I also like how the patches on the legs are the opposite color, which is just very clever by LEGO.</p>

<p>And then we have his great accessory, which is that horn piece. And it is just an extremely awesome piece, with that handle and everything. I just love how that piece turned out, with the black on the end. And it was new for the figure too which is cool, and it is a very uncommon piece from my understanding. So all cool there.</p>

<p>And I think that;s it for this figure! It s definately one of my top favorites of Series 1, and he&#39;s just all around, an excellent figure. I think he was a great choice as well. And the fact that back in the day&nbsp;he was only worth two bucks, is just really amazing. Now he&#39;s rather steep online, but if you wanted to pay that price,I don&#39;t think you would be disappointed whatsoever. He&#39;s just an awesome figure, in my opinion. So I hope this review was helpful, and thanks for reading!</p>
