"ecolema1","2010-05-19T19:32:35.437Z","I Hope LEGO changes the quality of these minifigures.","To be honest I have never had any situation with any Lego set that I have ever bought. LEGO is known for their wonderful quality and their wonderful service. But, as a collector and an older fan I loved the idea of having these minifigures. The zombie I have to say is probably my favorite one, but for all the lego fans out there I have to say the quality of these products are sub par. I know im not the only one saying it and I believe that Brickset did mention it in a review earlier in the year that they would be made in&nbsp;China. What a difference though, the first one I opened was the robot and right away the lack of quality was apparent. I also have the Robin Hood figure and I was almost ashamed I spent the money for it. Even two dollars worth. The accessories like the hat&nbsp;and the feather are&nbsp;way below the norm.&nbsp;Im sure most&nbsp;if not&nbsp;all lego fans would pay the extra money for the quality of some amazing minifures. They can't be that much more dollar wise a battle pack has? Correct me if im wrong five figures (haven't bought one in a bit) and those run $15-17 a piece thats only three dollars a figure. Well worth it I say for a quality robin hood figure, gunfighter, or ninja. I hope these reviews get back to Lego and they turn this product line around. My advice to everybody interested in the minifigures is pick one up and see what you think. I for one am disappointed&nbsp;about the quality, but&nbsp;in terms of the idea&nbsp;and the&nbsp;character choices&nbsp;LEGO never ceases to amaze me. ",FALSE,3,3,3,5,1

The inclusion of one in the CMF series 1 was genius, not only for LEGO fanatics to snap up, but for zombie fanatics as well. This is one you could see people buying multiples of - I know I did!</p><h4>Figure</h4><p>The coloration and detailing on the head is absolutely fantastic - it really does look like a zombified minifigure! The ripped and tattered clothing looks great in context of what the figure is, too. After that, there's not much to say. The fact that he didn't come with hair is sort of a let-down. He and the Crash Test Dummy are the only two in the series without some kind of head cover.</p><h4>Accessories</h4><div><ul><li><b>Shovel</b> - I guess he needed to dig himself out? Maybe he's going to dig up his friends?</li><li><b>Turkey Leg</b> - because sometimes you're not in the mood for brains.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><h4>Parts</h4><p>The head isn't very reusable - it can only be a zombie head. The tattered clothing could be used for post-apoc MOCs I suppose, though the gray skin-tone might make that not so desirable.&nbsp;</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>While he may be one of my favorites, there's not much usability outside of him being a zombie, whereas some of the other figures can be swapped out with others to make new combinations. I have swapped out the Zombie's head with the Spaceman's head to make a Zombie Spaceman, but that was the extent of it thus far. My only other guess is that people could use the head to modify into a Borg from Star Trek, if there are a lot of LEGO Star Trek MOCers out there.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall this guy gets low ratings due to the limitations inherent in his design, but he's still my third favorite of the series, after the <a href=""/reviews/?ID=34847"">Spaceman</a> and <a href=""/reviews/?ID=34918"">Robot</a>, so that's why I've reviewed him third.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,5
"DrathMaul1997","2010-06-25T11:20:58.763Z","Brains sir? What about a turkey leg instead?","At first glance this may seem like a nice set/mini-figure, however it's not really as good as it might look. For a start the accessories are a bit strange, why would a zombie have a turkey leg? Was the restaurant out of brains? And as another reviewer commented, what does he use the shovel for? Digging up other zombies is the most likely answer, but who dug him up?&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The mini figure is dressed in a (rather torn) grey suit with a yellowish shirt and brown tie.</div><div>His face is very scarred and has some glowing red eyes, he also has gray skin.</div><div><br></div><div>As for the uses for this figure, I'm stuck. No theme that I can think of would benefit from this mini figure, apart from the 2007-2009 castle line, but as his suit is a bit too 'modern' for that age he would stand out a bit. The only way I can think of doing it is to take his hands and head off and put them on another torso, however I've had a hard time finding one that looks good on him.&nbsp;Perhaps the best option is to just display him?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for reading and I hope it helps. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,4

I use their heads often (even on Woody and Buzz :D) and they are quite useful. The torn suit makes him look very dead, and accurate (DarthMaul1997, he has a suit because people are&nbsp;buried&nbsp;in them, so if you want Zombie soldiers, buy Army Men on Patrol:<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7595-1"">http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7595-1</a>&nbsp;) The&nbsp;accessories&nbsp;are great!

"Lego_Minifig_Man","2010-07-19T15:54:28.51Z","Definetly My Favourite Minifigure EVER!","<p>I found a fairly large supply of the collectible minifigs. I really REALLY wanted the Zombie and the Skater. I bought two packs, switching each pack with another like fifty times. I got the Zombie AND the Skater! By the way, I didn't know about the barcodes at the time. And yes, I am&nbsp;really lucky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>
<p><em>Head- </em>This is an&nbsp;amazing minifigure! The head consists of his eyes, mouth, eyebrows, and scars (or whatever they are). It's is a light gray color. His eyes are red and have dark gray around them. He is missing a few teeth (Poor guy!) and there's no way that you can&nbsp;really&nbsp;describe his mouth... it's open, I guess. He has some eyebrows, which I don't think was really neccesary.&nbsp; He has some scars, which is a very cool detail!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Torso- </em>He is wearing a suit which is all torn and ripped from when he got <strong>infected</strong>! A cool detail is that you can see some of the yellow-ish shirt in the torn places on his suit! He also has a tie on, which--&nbsp;now that I look at it, is only kind of wrinkled. Hmm. He has no printing on&nbsp;his back, which isn't good. (Maybe he was attacked in front?) His hands are the same color as his head (skin).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Legs- </em>His leg's aren't that special. They have some rips in them too-- another cool detail! The color matches his suit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Like all the other collectible minifigures, he comes with a stand. It's 3x4 flat with only four studs in the top going in a line. He also has... a... shovel? I guess he must've dug himself out of his grave? (Note to self: tell wife to bury me with shovel) Also, he has a chicken leg. It's a normal chicken leg with a peice sticking out so it can be made into that full chicken like in 'Medevil Market Village'.&nbsp;Looking at his bio on the Lego site, it says nothing about the shovel, but it says that the chicken leg motivates him and he follows it. Hmm. Well, looks like lego we're hoping that we'd use this guy&nbsp;as a nice zombie, instead of the 'Left 4 Dead' type which is AWESOME!</p>
<p><br/><strong>Other/Conclusion</strong><br/>I gave it a low building experience because the wasn't anything special. It was the typical 5-second-build that you do with every minifig. I didn't have any problems, though. It has tons of playibility, especially if you have more than one, so you can start an infection! The reason I gave it kinda&nbsp;a low value for money is because you don't know which minifig&nbsp;you're getting (Unless you have the barcode guide). But if you knew which one you were getting, I think it would definetly be worth $2.99. But&nbsp;even with&nbsp;a few&nbsp;problems, I'm going to reccomend it because, well, <strong>it's a zombie!</strong><br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/></p>",TRUE,5,4,2,5,3

<p>This figure appears in a sealed mystry poly bag, just like all the other Minifigure Series minifigs. This figure comes in Series 1 Collectible Minifigures. This figure is one of the most popular minifigs out of the bunch and I really don't know why. The reason I really like him is I used to play Plants Vs Zombies a lot back then, so thats why I wanted him, but what about everybody else?! This figure does come with a shovel, which is a bit strange. He also comes with a chicken leg which is pretty cool I guess. He has some really nice printings though on his torso, legs, head and he looks exactly like the zombies in Plants Vs Zombies PC Game!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The good thing about these figures is that there never too expensive to get, even if they're sold out. This figure is probably the rarest so far but I would assume his not going to be that expensive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>- Really nice figure- very rare</p>
<p>- Lots of printings on him</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>- A bit strange how it comes with a shovel</p>
<p>- Pretty hard to find in stores</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,1,5
"sideswinger","2020-07-22T20:18:50.573Z","Great choice, boring figure","<p>So as the fifth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1 is the Zombie, and he&#39;s a figure that I would call &quot;interesting&quot; to say the least. But before I give my full opinion, let&#39;s take a closer look.</p>

<p>And he has no hair piece, rather a blank stud, so I guess I&#39;ll be starting with the head. And the printing on it is pretty good overall, I guess. He has a &quot;dead&quot; expression on his face. Sorry, I just couldn&#39;t resist. Anyway, I like those red eyes, as well as his wonky teeth, and I just think the face looks pretty creepy. And no alternate face or anything, because that would look a bit strange from the back.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, and it looks pretty fitting for the figure, I guess. I like that messy tie, as well as the various ripe throughout the figure. I also like that white undershirt. And again, the rips look nice and add a nice touch to the overall figure. No printing on the back either, because this was a two dollar figure.</p>

<p>And then we have his legs, which aren&#39;t anything too special at all. They just have those three rips printed on there, so nothing to get excited over whatsoever. I guess some is better than none though, right?</p>

<p>And next is his accessories, and...yeah. I mean, what does a chicken leg and a shovel have to do with a zombie? It just doesn&#39;t make a lick of sense, if you ask me, and it probably never will. And the chicken leg piece is not anything special at all. It would be better if it was maybe some sort of new color, but nope. The shovel however, as confusing as it may be,&nbsp;is a pretty rare color for it, of my understanding. I think it might appear in a few other sets, but still, it&#39;s a very rare color for it.</p>

<p>And my final opinion of this figure is kind of confusing for even me to decide. I mean&nbsp;in 2010, zombies were like the most popular thing, so this is a splendid choice. But with that being said, I think the overall design is just not that exciting. And it wasn&#39;t really LEGO&#39;s fault, because zombies aren&#39;t fashion designers, but they could have at least given us some interesting accessories, like they do with a lot of other various CMF&#39;s. But nope. They give us a chicken leg and a shovel. I know LEGO could&#39;ve done more than that. And that&#39;s really my opinion overall. It&#39;s a choice that was definitely necessary for Series 1, but it&#39;s a figure I wish LEGO would&#39;ve done more with. Oh well, I guess we&#39;ll have to wait until 16 series&#39; down the road with Series 14.</p>

<p>And thanks for reading! I hope you guys found it somewhat interesting! If not, it was fun to write! And if you&#39;re thinking about paying top dollar for this o Ebay, I hope this helped you decide! Again, thanks for reading!</p>
