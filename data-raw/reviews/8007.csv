"desser1","2010-06-15T01:55:20.437Z","Legos new moneycow","I got this from my sister the other day. The first joy wore off pretty fast when I took a closer look at the packaging. 'Components made in China'. So now Lego also left for China to save a few cents. And what do we get? A honestly nice little Minifig (love the hair and the shirt - a little Dave Grohl) with a negligently build skateboard, that doesn't look like Lego but like a cheap toy from the german Kinder√ºberraschung (Kinder Surprise).<br>Overall that took a whole lot of fun from the that and a bit even from Lego for me. Now I can't buy Lego online anymore because I would firstly like to check where the set is coming from.<br>More on the set: Like with all the Collectible Minifigures you can only give lowest ratings to building experience, playabilty and value for money. I gave two bricks for playability anyway, because the skateboard - shabby built as it is - still makes fun driving it with fingers (like those finger skateboards that were hip ten years back). For the parts I gave four bricks since there is that nice wig and the skull t-shirt. This sums up for me to an overall rating of two bricks<br>",TRUE,2,4,1,2,1

"AETerry","2011-04-30T01:17:28.813Z","Skater Review","<p>He's not bad. The skateboard isn't anything new, but the idea of this as a minifigure for the CMs is good. The Skater's got a unique black wind swept or tussled hair piece. The print for the torso is fairly daring and good for LEGO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure certainly is fun to have and while I paid a bit more for it as CM 1 is out of production, I think it was well worth getting for my collection.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,5,4

"sideswinger","2020-07-22T22:04:21.137Z","Not the best, not the worst.","<p>So the sixth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1 is the Skater, and I think he&#39;s a decent figure overall. So let&#39;s get a more in-depth look at him.</p>

<p>On top we have that piece that I call the breezy hairpiece, and back in 2010 the piece was not all too common. From my understanding, it was not new for the series, but I think black was an uncommon color for that hair back in the day. And it doesn&#39;t come in black with any other CMF figure, from my understanding.</p>

<p>Then we have that face print, which looks pretty generic. Nothing too special going on there, but it is a pretty useful print overall. I like that smirk, as well as the eyebrows, and he has no alternate face, which is normal for these old CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso printing, which looks pretty cool if you ask me. I love the sand green color of it, and it has good printing on it as well. I like the skull on it, as well as that big front pocket, and it&#39;s just pretty useful outside of the figure too. And no back torso printing either.</p>

<p>And he just has those normal navy blue legs, and they have no printing on them either, so the legs are pretty boring overall. But like I said before, that is to be expected from a 2010 figure that&#39;s only two dollars.</p>

<p>And finally, his accessory is made up of three pieces; the skateboard, and the two wheels. And it is a very common piece in the world of Collectible Minifigures, so nowadays it isn&#39;t real amazing, and it wasn&#39;t new back then either. It is a sort of interesting color though, with that bluish/green hue, and it has no printing on it whatsoever, which is a little sad, but again, this was released in 2010.</p>

<p>And as a whole, this figure is just okay to me. Not the worst, but also not the best. I think this series definitely has some better figures for sure, but it has a few that are worse, so it&#39;s just an in-the-middle figure for me. And if you want to buy him, you can pay around twenty to thirty bucks for him on ebay. Yeah, sort of steep. But if you were planning on doing that, I hope this review helped you decide, and thanks for reading!</p>
