"vynsane","2010-06-04T16:58:41.873Z","KILL ALL HUMANS!","<p>I'll be reviewing all the Collectible Minifigures (CMFs) from my favorite to my least favorite. I've already reviewed the <a href=""/reviews/?ID=34847""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">Spaceman</font></a>, as he's my favorite (I say that a lot, apparently) and next up is the Robot!</p><h4>Figure</h4><div>As with the Spaceman, the Robot gets a high level of detail, including rivet circles on his feet, upper legs, hips, and torso. Additionally, the torso features a printed area on the abdomen that gives the impression of a cylindrical plated column inside a hollow area. Another riveted panel adorns the left-hand side of the torso, and the right side features a pressure or temperature gauge. The head print is also highly detailed under that helmet, with a print that looks like a silver faceplate above a hollow opening that features some sort of tubes, plus more rivets.</div><h4>Accessories</h4><div><ul><li><b>Helmet</b> - This all-new mold is a great addition, though it would have probably sufficed without the extra cost of creating it, seeing as how the head has a great print. The slit for the eyes is very cool and lines up rather well, and the lines denoting where individual plates have been riveted together look very natural.</li><li><b>Claw</b> - Instead of a normal right arm, the robot features a more technological arm with a pincer claw! You even get an extra one!</li><li><b>Baseplate</b> - As far as accessories go, this might be more useful in building than displaying, as minifigures tend to stand quite well on their own (unless, of course, you place them in odd, unbalanced, stances).</li></ul></div><h4>Parts</h4><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#AD1808"" size=""4""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;""><b><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""3""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px;"">I could see the parts of this figure coming in handy in many MOCs of a futuristic bent. The head, torso and right 'cybernetic' arm could all easily be swapped out to other figures to lend them a sci-fi flavor. The baseplate can also be used as a normal type of LEGO plate. The only difference is that it features only one row of four studs down the center instead of two rows, as would be expected. I look forward to the unusual ways MOCers are going to use it!</span></font></b></span></font></div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>The entirety of Series 1 is strong, in my opinion, but to me some outshine the competition. The Spaceman and Robot are two such entries. Next on the agenda is the Zombie!</div>",TRUE,4,5,1,4,5
"Orthobotrex","2010-08-25T07:48:55.8Z","It...Robot!","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my favorite among all the series 1 figs. The very thought that there is a minifig that resembles the robots of old is what attracted me to it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like the prints, though they have my usual hangups. And of course, the plastic is somewhat&nbsp;pliable. I think the helmet should always be put on, though. The face is better kept under wraps. I do wish that they made the left arm the same as the right for&nbsp;not doing so for me meant that he was more of an android than a true robot.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would want to build an army of these. But I'd be satisfied with ten of them, despite the drawbacks. I gave it a relatively high rating among the others I have simply because I think&nbsp;it is the best!",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4

"Carl","2010-12-25T18:54:23.087Z","Robot","The best minfig from series 1 in my opinion. He has a very neat torso with one arm more robot looking and an awesome headpiece with antennae. Although the helmet looks absolutely amazing on this minifig, he still looks great without it, as he has a nicely printed head underneath. He comes with no accessories, but he is still a very good minifig. Anyway, you can use the spare robot hand as a sort of spanner if you're pedantic. The playability goes down along with the building experience simply because it's just a minifig, and I only gave value for money a 5/5 because I received series 1 and 2 for Christmas,thus getting this guy for free. And I am very happy with him. Overall the robot is an absolute triumph on LEGO's part, and I would definitely recommend him to all LEGO fans.",FALSE,5,5,3,3,5
"Alemas","2011-11-01T10:39:18.923Z","Apparently, the Robot has ""three tin cans, string from a kite, a coat hanger, a wind-up music box, and an old tea kettle"" as internal parts. :P","<p>This is one of the better Series 1 Collectable Minifigures.

"Firox_5000","2010-09-13T16:47:31.57Z","A good figure if found","<p>The Robot came out in series 1 of the minifigure collection. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure contains 6 pieces and is extremly easy to assemble.</p>

<p>The Robot doesn't come with any particular acceseries but he is amazing without any as it stands. He has a nice unique head with spikes on top as well as a detailed chest. </p>

"sideswinger","2020-07-23T18:39:43.373Z","A pretty good figure!","<p>So this is the seventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1 is the Robot, and I think he&#39;s a preety good figure in the series. So let&#39;s get a closer look at him!</p>

<p>On top we have that bucket head piece, and it&#39;s a really cool part. It&#39;s just a very detailed piece, and I just love how it turned out. It was new for the series, and it&#39;s just an excellent piece for 2010. I think it&#39;s my favorite part of the figure, and I just do really love how it looks.</p>

<p>Then we have his face print, and even though you can&#39;t see it from the picture, it looks great. I love the red eyes as well as the technical looking stuff on it. It&#39;s just a really neat face overall. And no printing on the other side either, which is to be expected from a two dollar, 2010 figure.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso and arms, which do look great. I love his front torso printing with that red and green meter, then that stomach printing looks great as well. No back torso printing though, as always. But he also has that robot arm, which looks really neat. I love the technical looking design of it, but I must admit, I think he needs it on both sides. No arm printing on the other arm either. And the claw on that robot arm is a seperate piece, of course.</p>

<p>Then we have his legs, and since it was 2010 I like how LEGO was generous enough to actually print those circles all over them. You&#39;d think they would just leave the legs blank, but they actually took the effort to print them, so that&#39;s cool.</p>

<p>And he has no accessory, but I don&#39;t mind too much because the figure itself is really neat. While I do think there are better figures in the series, like the Caveman, Clown, and Magician, I think this is probably the upper middle tier for me. He is a nice figure, but I think there&#39;s better CMF robots, and I also think there&#39;s some better characters in this series. But still, a neat figure. And I think that wraps up this review! And you might be confused why I&#39;m writing this ten years from its release, and if you were, it&#39;s because these are still available on Ebay and I want this to help people make up their minds, because it&#39;s pretty steep online. So thanks for reading!</p>
