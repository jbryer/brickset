"AETerry","2011-06-11T15:08:13.5Z","Demolition Dummy Review","<p>I got this free, so I can't complain at all about the price of this minifigure. I can't say it's the most exciting looking of all the minifigures out.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The print job for the mini's legs, torso and head to show that this is a Demolition or Crash Test Dummy is decent enough. The accessories seem like they're more for giving it something to hold then be just a plain minifigure.</p>

"JtheMonk","2011-02-19T09:51:04.73Z","Possibly the Worst Ever","I'm surprised at how high the rating for this minifigure is. Not only is this hands down the most boring figure of the series 1 set, it is--as my title suggests--possibly the worst collectible minifigure <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ever</span>. When series 1 was in stores, I never saw anyone open a package with a Demolition Dummy in it and then not complain that they would rather have gotten a different figure (or spent their money on something else entirely).<br><br>The minifigure itself is the same bland black-and-yellow as every other standard minifigure, with nothing truly new or interesting to make it stand out. Its blank, staring facial expression may be the worst part, as it seems to be mocking you about all the other, better series 1 minifigures that could have potentially been in the bag you just opened instead.<br><br>In terms of accessories, the wrench has appeared at least a hundred times in other sets and, unless you're doing a car MOC of some kind, it's hard to be too excited by the license plate.<br><br>I'm not sure why most other reviewers are so positive about this guy, unless they were planning to drive their lego cars into brick walls (ones made of lego or otherwise) and were happy to have a crash test dummy because they didn't want any of their better minifigures to get hurt.<br><br>Maybe you want one to complete the 16-piece set, but that's about it.<br>",TRUE,1,1,3,2,1
"sideswinger","2020-07-23T22:26:11.177Z","A TERRIBLE figure","<p>So the Demolition Dummy is the eighth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1, and this is a figure I just do not care for or like whatsoever. But before I give my final opinion, let&#39;s take a closer look at him!</p>

<p>And he has no hair, so let&#39;s start with the head. And he has a pretty boring face in my opinion, with that logo on his forehead, as well as those blank eyes. It just looks pretty mediocre and boring if you ask me. No back head printing either.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso, which is also pretty mediocre. He has those two logos once again, this time on his chest, and he has a little&nbsp;printing on his stomach as well. No back torso printing either, once again.</p>

<p>Then we have his legs, which have a bit of&nbsp;printing on them. They just have four of those circular logos, so not very exciting. I wish they would&#39;ve done some side leg printing just to spruce him up a bit, but oh well.</p>

<p>Then we have his accessories, which are just as boring as the rest of the figure. He does have two though, which I guess is something. Doesn&#39;t help that they&#39;re both boring though. He has that black wrench piece, which we&#39;ve got in so many sets. I guess his other accessory is okay though. It&#39;s just that 1x2 tile with &quot;PA7 70&quot; printed on it. I think it&#39;s supposed to be a license plate, which to me doesn&#39;t make sense for a crash dummy, but maybe I&#39;m just an idiot and doesn&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>And as a whole, I am just not a fan of this dude, for so many reasons. First off, his printing and overall design is very boring, and uninteresting. I mean they could&#39;ve at least done side leg printing. Second, he reminds me a lot of the Series 1 Zombie, where the figure isn&#39;t that great, and his two accessories are supposed to make up for it, and fail. I mean, this guys accessories don&#39;t make any sense to me, like the Zombie. But while the Zombie was a mediocre figure, don&#39;t get me wrong, he&#39;s way better than this guy. And finally, he&#39;s just an absolutely terrible choice. When I think of interesting categories, &quot;crash dummies&quot; do not come to mind. It just seems like a choice they&#39;d use when they&#39;ve run out of ideas, which they obviously didn&#39;t due to the other 19 non-licensed series&#39; released at the time of this review. It&#39;s just incredibly niche.</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re thinking about buying some Series 1 off ebay for twenty to fifty bucks, this would be the last one I&#39;d buy, because he&#39;s totally my least favorite in the series. However, if you&#39;re trying to complete Series 1, you kind of have to buy this guy. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s the plague, I just think LEGO could&#39;ve done a lot better.</p>

<p>So sorry for my ranting, but thanks for reading!</p>
