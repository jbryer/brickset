<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building is great fun, like all old sets all small parts and with a great result. You finally have 3 cars including a towingtruck, a service-shop and an alarmphone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts are just great!!&nbsp;The shop and servicecar have all kinds of small tools, the shop has also a tyre repair machine. The towingtruck has 2 functioning ramps and a good towing device, the same you find on the castles. The broke-down car&nbsp;has a hood you can open, nice thinking here. The set includes 3 nice mini-figures which is sufficient. It would have been 5 bricks here too if it was completed with a road groundplate, really the only thing I miss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reading my review you can only conclude playability is great, a well deserved 5 bricks here too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money is ok for me too, Bricklink offers an average value of â‚¬33,50. I think it is definitly worth it, esspecailly for Dutch collectors, and I paid even less.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
