"absolutelylez","2010-06-08T11:36:29.607Z","Not the best, not the worst","A few notes to make you aware of:<br><br>1. The magic stick is not as nice as it looks on the picture. The stick is black and has white printing: the white printing does not have as smooth a line as shown in the picture; the line where the white meets black is quite irregular and doesn't look that nice.<br><br>2. The hat really shows how much lower quality the plastic is. Comparing the top hat to others from other Lego sets, the Magician's one does not have any nice shine, it is quite cheap looking.<br>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3

"legospongepotter","2011-01-18T18:12:02.637Z","Now you see it, now you don't.","This is a great Minifigure. I got this for five bucks on eBay for my little brother's birthday. He was very happy to get it.&nbsp;<div>It comes with this sort of baseplate that has a row of&nbsp;four&nbsp;studs in the middle for the&nbsp;Minifigure&nbsp;to stand on.&nbsp;</div><h4>Hat</h4><div>The top-hat is my first. It is solid black and feels durable. It looks good on the&nbsp;Minifigure. It isn't very tall but looks just right.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-weight: bold; ""><br></span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-weight: bold; "">Hairpiece</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-weight: bold; ""></span>I am happy it came with this hairpiece. It is short and messy black hair. I suppose you use it for those tricks like pulling a rabbit out of the hat (A rabbit piece would be really cool). It looks good on the magician.'</div><h4>Head</h4><div>What a realistic head! This magician looks just like a real magician. He has a yellow head, of course. He has a small triangular goatee with a long, curled mustache. He is sort of smirking and his eyebrows are made to look like he's concentrating hard. His eyes are the normal Minifigure eyes.</div><h4>Torso</h4><div>He has a brand new torso. He has a black jacket on. It is curved so you can see the inside at the inner edge. He has two pockets in the lower part of his torso. He has a white button-up shirt with black buttons and a collar. The shirt looks old and has some rips at the bottom. He wears a red bow near his neck. He has what looks like a large red belt, but is probably part of his shirt. He has no back-printing. He has black arms and&nbsp;white&nbsp;hands so it looks like he has&nbsp;white&nbsp;gloves on.</div><h4>Legs</h4><div>His legs are the standard black legs, the same color as most of his torso and his hat. However, despite the plain appearance, it looks realistic because a magician would have black pants.</div><h4>Wand</h4><div>The wand is another new and unique part of the magician. Like a real magic wand (or at least, a fake real wand) it has two white ends that cover all of the ends. In between in the middle is solid black. It is a regular stick that is about the size of a Harry Potter wand but this looks shorter. However, it is well designed and is cute.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Overall</h4><div>This is a good Minifigure. The design is realistic and the whole thing is a good addition to a City fan, for some sort of&nbsp;performance&nbsp;at night, for Minifigure collectors because of how unique it is, and for anyone whole likes rare pieces because of the wand. It also came with this sort of paper that tells how to put the Minifigure together and on the flip side, a list of the other Series 1 Minifigures.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Building Experience - Well, what can you expect from a Minifigure? Because of the obvious fact you won't build much, this gets a 5</div><div><br></div><div>Parts - I love the wand and torso, and the hat is also cool. Then the whole Minifigure is new, so it gets a 5</div><div><br></div><div>Playability - Unless you can make your own props, you can't exactly do much with the Minifigure alone. However, I got a coin and was able to make a trick of my own that the magician preforms. It would be cool if there was one trick, like a rabbit, though. I give it 3.</div><div><br></div><div>Value for Money - 5 bucks on eBay is worth it for this Minifigure and 2 dollars, I think, in stores is a bargain. 5.</div><div><br></div><div>5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 18/20 - 4/5</div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Definitely worth it, any Lego fan should own the magician.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T23:27:07.03Z","ABRACADABRA!","Set #8683 Magician: This was my second Collectible Mini-Figure with the first Nurse I picked up. The Magician is one of the better offers from this series, it includes a new magic staff, a top hat and a hairpiece so that when he's pulling rabbits out of his hat he isn't bald. In fact I think if they'd included a little LEGO rabbit with him he'd be perfect, as it stands he's just an interesting new career type for the LEGO City universe.",FALSE,4,3,1,4,5
"AETerry","2011-05-05T21:31:22.747Z","Magician Review","<p>Well.... I'm not sure why so many of the others who've reviewed the Magician before me have complained so much or have said they found this minifigure boring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I for one found him to be rather intriguing, it's the classic Magician dressed in a tuxedo type suit with white gloves and top hat. His wand is the classic black with white tips too. For the design, I'd say LEGO has done very well with this minifigure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New accessory with the wand, new print design for the suit. Even the face is a special print design to give him a mustache and goatee. He even came with a black hair piece so you can show him taking his hat off while doing a trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can think of plenty of MOCs and sets to place this minifigure in, just like alot of the other Minifigures in other series runs, I'm sure people can think of&nbsp;a MOC where I might see limited use. Unless people just don't like classic image of a Stage Magician anymore, I think this mini is great!</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,5,5

"sideswinger","2020-07-07T03:12:49.447Z","Best in the Series!","<p>So the Magician was number 9 in Series 1, and even though I don&#39;t have him, he is my favorite of the series! So let&#39;s get a more in-depth look at each part of him!</p>

<p>So the top hat tops him off, and I&#39;m not sure, but I think it was new for the series, which is cool, and it has a flat top with a wide brim, and it could be used for many things, including a custom Abe Lincoln. And one of the reasons I love this figure so much, is because he not only comes with that hat, but also an alternate hair piece. And&nbsp; that is the &quot;wig boy&quot; hair in black, which isn&#39;t too special, but still is a really nice and generous inclusion.</p>

<p>Next we have the face, which looks nice. I like the eyebrows and mustache, which both look great. And he has no alternate face, which is fine with me, be cause if he did, it would look awkward with that top hat piece. Still, a nice face print.</p>

<p>Then we have the torso, which looks excellent. He has that red bow tie as well as the red waistband, and then the white undershirt looks great as well. He also has the black overcoat printing, which looks nice as well. And he has no back torso printing unfortunately, but that&#39;s alright since this series was only 2 bucks a pop.</p>

<p>And the legs are just plain black; no printing whatsoever, but again, that&#39;s alright because it was only 2 bucks. I would kind of like to see a newer updated magician with leg printing and all, so who knows.</p>

<p>And then his accessory (besides the extra hair) is that wand piece, which looks great. It has those white bands printed around the end of the staff, and it is just the perfect accessory for a perfect figure.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for him! He is totally my favorite of Series 1, and if I wasn&#39;t one years old, I would have totally snatched up this fig. Nonetheless, this is a great figure, So thanks for reading!</p>
