<p>But I digress. Let us Review the Super Wrestler. When I first opened the bag for this one I was really excited that I managed to get it, the printing on this figure is superb and really stands out in my City collection, you see this guy walking down the street and you know not to mess with him. Plus he has a cape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He doesn't come with any accessories, but for that I don't really mind, because the dollar value of all these Mini-Figures are great even if you only get a few of them. I'm not sure if it would be worth it on the second hand market though, I'm not sure how expensive these things have gotten now that they have all vanished from retail. (At least in my area.) But if you can get a good deal on a group of Series 1 figures the Super Wrestler will definitely enhance your City display.</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,5

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Intended Minifigure</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hoping for the Skateboarder which I didnt got.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Method Of Identification For Minifigure</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought that barcodes are a waste of time, so I used the more effective method, feeling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts Felt For Intended Minifigure And Parts From The Gotten Minifigure Which Are Identical.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt for the skateboard and I thought I got it but it was actually the cape for the Super Wrestler. They both feels no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boring, the worst minifigure of all! Only the cape for the accesory.</p>
<h4>Themes To Fit In</h4>

"woodall_aidan","2012-04-07T11:08:57.893Z","8683-2 Super Wrestler","Luchadores! The super wrestler! This set is my personal favorite from Series 1. The wrestler has a medium blue head with a red mask and a frown. The torso is yellow and has a medium blue wrestling undershirt and gold belt. The legs have red hips and medium blue legs with white designs on them. The figure also comes with a red cape. This figure easily gets a 5/5.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,4
"sideswinger","2020-07-24T22:26:43.537Z","An awful figure","<p>So the tenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1 is the Super Wrestler and...yeah. Let&#39;s just get a closer look.</p>

<p>And he has no hair, so let&#39;s start with the face. I do think it&#39;s a nice print, with that angry mouth and red mask. I&#39;m also pretty impressed at the intricate white lines around the mask. No printing on the back of the head, of course.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso, which is very nicely detailed. I like that blue muscle shirt over him, as well as that big gold and black belt. Then he has those muscles under the shirt too, which do look great. No back torso printing though, and that kind of stinks, and is pretty inconsistent with the blue overalls in front.</p>

<p>Then we have his legs, which have a bit of printing on them, with those white wings. It&#39;s also kind of interesting that the waist is red and not blue like the leg pieces.</p>

<p>And he has no accessory, but he does have a red cape. There&#39;s no pattern or anything special on it though, so it&#39;s just a boring, plain, red cape.</p>

<p>So now it&#39;s time for my overall opinion, and I seriously don&#39;t like this guy, the more I look at him. No accessory for 1, and the lack of back torso printing really hurts. Yes, he does have some great front facial printing, and his leg printing is alright, but there&#39;s a lot of other problems I have with this guy. First, I hate the fact that there is no accessory. They could have at least given him a trophy or something. Second, a wrestler seems sort of niche for a first series, but a&nbsp;<em>super</em>&nbsp;wrestler? What even is that? I&#39;ve never heard of a &quot;super&quot; wrestler! In fact, we had to wait until Series 15 to get a normal, traditional wrestler, which is pretty bad if you ask me. And third, in the LEGO Movie (set NO. 70809), an El Macho figure was included. To me, he seems like a remake of this dude. And I think that figure was better.</p>

<p>The more I look at this guy, the more I think he might be my new least favorite figure of the series. Sheesh, him and the Demolition Dummy are neck-in-neck for last&nbsp;place. If you&#39;re thinking about buying this dude online, I would buy the other figures first, but if you&#39;re trying to complete the series, you have to get this guy. And that&#39;s all for this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
