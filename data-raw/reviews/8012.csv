<p>The nurse includes a seringe piece and a printed list on a flat square place. The figure also has a nice new hair piece and printing on her chest. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE BUILD</p>
<p>Well,whats to say? All you have to do is to put 7 or so parts together!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PLAYABILITY</p>
<p>If you have some of the 07 hospital sets or even some football sets, theirs allways something you can add her to, right? But if you have not got anywhere to put here,&nbsp;you might have a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PARTS</p>
<p>Amazing, just amazing.&nbsp;The new parts are usefull, the syringe (x2)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;printed slate showing some sort of a result of a test on his/her&nbsp;health. Their's a name on it witch reads ""dawes"".If its a joke i would like to know what's&nbsp;funny! The bodys new, a nice detail is the printed watch.Pretty much the same for the head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE MONEY</p>
<p>As all minifigures are, their a bit steap.&nbsp;I get them about £1.50/£2.50&nbsp;so to me its the only con.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OVERALL RATING</p>
<p>I have to give it a five because their so many unique parts to this set.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,4,3

She comes with a clip-board printed plate and two syringes, so I have four in total, and she looks very nice with her Nurse Uniform printing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

"AETerry","2011-04-18T22:56:09.327Z","Nurse Review","<p>As I missed all of Series 1, I've started placing orders for them from sites offering a specific minifig, a little bit more then if I'd been able to buy them randomly, but still worth the money if they're not to highly priced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nurse figure works out as a much needed minifigure, not just for the Collecters, but those building MOCs and creating their own Lego Towns/Cities. If you can get more then one, so much the better as you can then switch out hair and head pieces to create different nurses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quality of plastic doesn't seem to match up to the quality of plastic used in later series of Minifigures. There's a definent texture feel for how ""strong"" the plastic is. What's great is the hair piece, introduced with this minifigure, the syringe (you get 2) and the tile piece that's got a print on it for a patient's records. The print piece on the torso is also great, I'd almost make her the Doctor and the other medical minifigures I have nurses as their prints don't look as nice, even with taking consideration their age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was worth getting, even if a bit extra after a series is gone.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,5,4
"sideswinger","2020-07-25T16:06:17.11Z","An EXCELLENT figure!","<p>So the Nurse is the eleventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1, and I do really like this figure. I just love how she turned out. So let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that pony tail piece, which is a very common part in the world of CMF, and the world of LEGO all around. We got it in Series 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 20, which is just naming the non-licensed ones alone. I don&#39;t really mind too much though, because it is a nice piece. And back in 2010, it was a very uncommon piece, which is shocking, since it&#39;s probably the most common female hairpiece of all time, nowadays. And it&#39;s in a dark brown color as well, which might&#39;ve been a new color for it back then.</p>

<p>Then we have her face printing, which looks pretty nice. I like her smirk, as well as her eyebrow printing. No alternate face of course, which is normal in Series 1. But since it was only two bucks, I don&#39;t mind at all.</p>

<p>Then we have her torso print, which looks awesome. I love how it turned out. You got that nice blue logo on her white outfit, then she also has thosenice curve lines. I just think that it&#39;s an extremely useful torso. And like always, no back torso printing, since it was 2010.</p>

<p>And her legs have no printing, they are just those plain white, which doesn&#39;t bother me whatsoever. I don&#39;t think they needed to be anything special. Sure printing is neat, but here I don&#39;t think it was needed, so I like the plain white.</p>

<p>And her accessories are my favorite part of the whole figure. Just some amazing pieces. And she has two as well, which is even better. First, she has that clipboard printing on the 2x2 tile, which looks great and is pretty useful too. I love the name on it, which is just two&nbsp;letters off from my own last name, which is pretty neat. I also love the heart beat status on it as well. But her syringe piece is just brilliant. I just love how it came out, with those measuring lines on it, as well as the two handles on it, which is awesome. And it is caste in gray as well, which is a color I haven&#39;t seen too often with it. It was new for the figure too, which is pretty neat, especially in 2010.</p>

<p>And my overall opinion for this is great, because this is a great figure. I just really love how she came out, for a lot of&nbsp;reasons. First off, she&#39;s just a really detailed figure, with great parts and prints, and she&#39;s really legendary for the time of its release. Second, she&#39;s just a brilliant choice, since being a nurse is a very popular career choice, for great reason. These are people who help save lives, which is why I think this is just a very great figure choice, especially for a first series. And finally, third, this figure reminds me of my sister, who&#39;s planning on becoming a nurse in the future. Plus, it&#39;s her favorite of the series, for great reason too.</p>

<p>And I think this figure is slowly becoming my favorite of the series. She and the Magician put up a good fight for my favorite, and either way, this fig is totally in my top two. So if you&#39;re planning on ordering her on Ebay for top dollar for yourself or maybe a friend, I think it&#39;s worth it, because she is a great figure. So hopefully this helped you decide. And I think that wraps up this review, so thanks for reading!!!</p>
