"absolutelylez","2010-05-14T09:42:25.45Z","Only get this if you don't have any other ninjas","While the golden swords are nice accessories, the figure in general is very uninspiring. Figures that were released in the actual ninja series were of higher quality and generally more interesting. <br><br>If you do not already have a ninja, this will be a nice addition but otherwise try and get rid of it!<br>",TRUE,2,1,3,4,2
"Kalhiki","2010-06-16T15:23:07.2Z","Very nice Ninja figure","<p>Toys R Us had Minifigures, so I decided to pick one up, and I got the Ninja.</p>
<p>The building experience was&nbsp;fine. I mean, come on, it's a minifig so it's going to be easy. There really isn't much else to say.</p>
<p>The parts are actually pretty good. I would have liked if the body had back printing, but it's good how it is. Included in the parts, you get a very nice gold katana. Better yet, there's two because one's an extra part. He also has a ninja hood which I haven't seen in many sets.&nbsp;I like that on the back of the hood there is a clip which is where I put the extra sword. If I'm not mistaken, the head is a new print. He looks very stern and tough- very good face for a ninja. The stand he comes with is also an interesting piece.</p>
<p>Because it's&nbsp;just a minifig you aren't going to get much playability. But it is more of a display piece, so I can excuse it.</p>
<p>I think I got this for three dollars. It does seem a little pricey, but it won't&nbsp;make a big impact in your budget.&nbsp;Something tells me these minifigs will be valuable in the future, and with all the detail put in some of&nbsp;them, I think they're worth your money. Despite my low ratings on everything else, this guy easily gets five stars (or bricks, whatever).</p>",TRUE,5,3,2,3,4
"Pencoin1","2010-05-14T16:14:35.513Z","It's a good fig, but we had a whole Ninja theme before!","<p>This Ninja figure in the new blindpacked Mini-Figure range is quite good! </p>
<p>He has new facial expression and torso design. While a bit generic, they are both unique and useful. His mask is nothing new but still very good. There is a 'holster' for the sword molded on the back of the mask. It is very ugly and does not hold the sword well which is quite a bummer. The sword is nice but it is nothing new and it is gold. While gold is cool, what kind of lowly Ninja like this would have a gold sword? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure also comes with a stand which is very good for use as a part or to display the figure. So even though the figure is very good - we had a whole Ninja theme before, but that was a few years ago so I imagine they made this figure so young children who don't really care about LEGO's history&nbsp;can get a ninja. My last thought on the figure is that it has the so called 'Chinese' markings. This are not really to do with China and even though they are hard to see they still bother me because I have OCD. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So overall it is a good figure with some good parts but the idea is nothing new. </p>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,3
"Don_Cristo","2010-06-27T03:57:00.91Z","Not as good as they old ninja minifigs used to be","<p>&nbsp; Since I have been a LEGO Ninja freak for many years, I madly expected TLC to bring it back to life. The ninja was therefore one of the reasons why I fell for the collectable minifigs. Unfortunately, expectations were greater than what came out of the bag.<br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; First striking thing: the collectable minifig's quality is poorer than common sets'. Legs bend far too easily, the plastic used is clearly of lower quality. The printing on the torso is far from extraordinary. Aspect and details were far better, when it came to Castle Ninja sets. Another strange thing is the colour of the katanas: gold! Has anyone ever fought with gold? An expensive and not quite useful metal, for making a sword. Interesting point about the katanas, though: they used the old katanas with the octogonal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">tsuba</span>, different from the Prince of Persia ones. The last bad point (in my opinion) is the slanting eyes, which do not mix well with a common yellow-skinned minifig.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; Nevertheless, I am quite delighted I could find several ninjas. I can't wait to find a good way to use them.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4
"icepick","2010-07-15T17:46:42.59Z","Finally a perfect ninja","I missed the boat on the original release of all the ninja sets.&nbsp; And now they are so expensive as to wholly prevent me from indulging.&nbsp; But this guy is the perfect substitute.<br><br>He comes with sweet gold decorated swords, he was an awesome looking face under his mask, and his ninja robe looks perfect.<br><br>A+ all around.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Carl","2010-12-25T20:14:34.167Z","Ninja","The Ninja is a very cool minifig. His golden katana is very cool and it can fit onto the back of his hood as well as in his hand. But other than the katana and the hood, he's a pretty generic minifig, which is why he doesn't get 5/5 in terms of overall awesomeness. Playability and building experience go down because he's just a minifig, and value for money is 5/5 because I got series1 and 2 for Christmas, thus getting this guy for free. Overall the Ninja is certainly one of the&nbsp;collectable&nbsp;minifigs that I would recommend to most.",FALSE,4,4,2,3,5

"Firox_5000","2010-10-04T14:29:18.257Z","Ninja Squad","<p>I got this from the first series of minifigures. He has 7 pieces and takes no longer than 2 minutes to build. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This figure is&nbsp; really good and is what we have been waiting for ages, a ninja. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure contains pieces that very much resemble an old 90's style ninga minifigure. He comes with a spair sword which if oyu want you can give him a double.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure goes well with the ninga theme and goes well with fighting scenes too. I managed to somehow get 5 of these. luckilly unlike some this figure is quite for army building but gets crazy if you get more than 5.</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,3
"woodall_aidan","2012-04-07T11:19:39.117Z","8683-12 Ninja","This set is a great set. The ninja has a black ninja mask with a back clip for a sword or something. The head is a yellow head with a stressed pattern. The torso is black with multiple printed robe and layers and the legs are basic black legs. The figure also has a golden katana sword. Luckily, this figure was released before Ninjago was released, so people got this set before Ninjago, even though this figure is partially compatible with Ninjago. This set gets a 4/5.<br>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T23:15:37.383Z","NINJA VANISH!","<p>Set #8683 Ninja: I got this the same day as the Super Wrestler and I was really, really, really glad that I managed to get him. I love the Ninja theme of LEGO and this little guy goes great with the few I managed to pick up back in the 90's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He comes in black, something the original Ninja's didn't... I think...and he includes two katana. Their coloring may or may not be intended to represent gold blades, it's a little tricky to tell. Out of all of Series 1 there are only a few that I consider must haves, this one, the nurse, the cheerleader and possibly a few others. If you don't already have one of these guys and can get a good deal on him second hand I strongly recommend picking him up.</p>",TRUE,5,4,1,5,5
"sideswinger","2020-07-25T17:23:20.197Z","A HORRIBLE figure!","<p>So the twelfth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1 is the Ninja, and this is a figure I have never been a fan of. But let&#39;s get a closer look.</p>

<p>On top we have that ninja hood piece, which is was a very common part back in the day. The piece has that hole for the eyes to see through, and it also has that clip in the back for the sword to go. They give you an extra sword too, so you could store one there if you&#39;d like. But it had appeared in lots of sets before this, so it just isn&#39;t exciting. But to be fair, it&#39;s probably the most exciting part of this figure, so that&#39;s pretty sad.</p>

<p>Then his face print underneath is pretty boring as well, with that angry frown. He also has those eyebrows above his eyes, which have those wrinkles on the sides of them. No alternate face, which is normal for Series 1.</p>

<p>Then his torso printing looks very boring as well, with those white lines and all. It doesn&#39;t look special or exciting in any way. No back torso printing either, which is disappointing, but normal for Series1.</p>

<p>And his legs are just plain black, so let&#39;s get to the accessory. It&#39;s just a boring pearl gold katana. Two do come with the figure, one of which is an extra piece. And the sword is such an obvious choice, and is very boring to me.</p>

<p>So overall, I just seriously dislike this figure. When I wrote the review for the Series 1 Demolition Dummy figure, I thought it was the worst in the series. But now, after I&#39;ve wrote reviews on them both, my new bottom two is the Super Wrestler and this dude. I do think Super Wrestler is worse than this, but still, this is terrible. No new parts. No good prints. Just an uninteresting figure. However,I do think he&#39;s a decent choice, since ninjas are pretty popular. But, like the Series 1 Zombie, the execution isn&#39;t great (the Zombie was a ton better than this, though). I do think kids would enjoy playing with this, since it is a ninja, so if I were a young child I would like this. But as a &quot;collector&quot; this is very boring and stupid.</p>

<p>And I think that wraps up this review! So check out my other Series 1 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
