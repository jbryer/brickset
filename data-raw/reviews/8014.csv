<p>However, the colour of the fig is not what you see in the picture here but much more milky and the clutch power of the feet on the stand is a bit weak.</p>
<p>For $4 AU (the most expensive in the world I believe) this isn't great value, and because of that and the quality issue I'm not tempted to have a squadron of these, but it's a great fig for space fans to have one copy of.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,2
"washen","2010-05-18T20:03:26.483Z","Cool, but a little too Asian...","I got this today at my local TRU (North Carolina, USA) and it's a very interesting little figure. It came in a thick polybay lined with silver wrapping on the inside. All of the components are made in China, which is a little disappointing, but it still looks pretty good. The blaster is especially cool and it features a new, slightly shorter trans blue stick to go with it. The pieces themselves feel a little bit cheap and the helmet is almost a mix between a regular and a rubber piece. All in all, I give this set a 3.5/5 because it does&nbsp;look nice and is great for anyone with a love for space sets, but the plastic is pretty cheap and the pieces don't fit together quite as well as good 'ol Danish bricks.",FALSE,4,3,2,5,4

"vynsane","2010-05-29T09:25:12.403Z","The NEW Classic Space","As the first pics of the Collectible Minifigures hit the web, I already KNEW this guy was my favorite - SPACE has always been my favorite theme, and this guy is like a straight-up tailor-made Neo-Classic Space figure. After finally finding a Toys R Us that had them in stock, I ended up with FOUR of him.<h4>Figures</h4><div>This will be the meat of the review, seeing as how it's a minifigure in a bag. The Spaceman has an all-white space suit with printing on the front of the torso and legs. The torso features some intricate detailing as well as a new iteration of the Classic Space logo! The facial expression (as is the case with a lot of the Collectible Minifigures) is pretty hilariously cartoony, with a cocked eyebrow and 'heroic' grin to go along with his chiseled cheekbones. It's too bad they didn't print a second 'scared' face on the back, but I plan to mix and match heads anyway - I already put one of my 'Cowboy' heads on a Spaceman and vice versa - it looked pretty good! I think I'll make a Zombie Spaceman next.</div><h4>Accessories</h4><div><ul><li><b>Helmet</b> - The first non-dark blue/gray version of the new 'Space Police Commando' helmet, it has a good bit of molded detail around the chin.</li><li><b>Visor</b> - Transparent Smoke looks good on this one, although Trans Orange would've worked as well. You get an extra in the package, too!</li><li><b>Raygun</b> - Newly molded just for this figure (thus far, I'd look forward to seeing it more in the future) this gun SCREAMS 50's B-Movie Sci-Fi camp. Awesome.</li><li><b>Raygun Blast (3L bar)</b> - Connect the&nbsp;Transparent Light Blue 3L Bar to show Spaceman&nbsp;in the process of firing his Raygun!</li></ul><h4>Conclusion</h4></div><div>As Minifigures seem to cost $3(US) at a LEGO Store Build-a-Minifigure, $1.99 is a great deal for a highly-detailed, unique figure. People are complaining about cheap plastic, but I don't really see a huge difference between in-set figures and these. I like all of the figures in series 1, but this guy gets my absolute highest recommendation. I wanted to leave 'Build Experience' blank, so as to say 'Not Applicable' but you are required to enter a rating on each category. I didn't want to make it a '1' even though there's not much to the build, so I made it 5 across the board.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

But For Me, It's Hardly Noticeable. also, The Gun is to Die For. If You Haven't Already Died over The 3L Bar! (LOL!) Another Thing, Some People May Say This isn't Regular White, But I Took The legs off to put on a Chef Torso.....<em>&amp; It Looked Normal! </em>But Hey, Let's Go to The Pros and Cons:</p>

He seems to serve as an indicator of what the classic space theme would have been like had it been made using the art style of 2010 Lego. Nostalgia aside, this is an excellent figure; the detailing is amazing (especially the logo and space suit) and the parts are new and useful. The head is perfect for a cocky space hero from the classic serials and the raygun is very retro sci-fi. The laser beam piece is also excellent for short lightsabers in the Star Wars theme (known as shotos in the Star Wars Universe). The one big issue with this fig is that the bottom of the helmet obscures the mouth on the included minifig head and almost all other heads that I posses: if not for this flaw, I would have given this fig a perfect 10, but using another helmet of taking some small tools to the helmet could solve the problem.</SPAN></p>

"P13c30fch33s3","2010-05-29T21:47:51.577Z","A great way to replace your old space minifigs","This minifigure is essentially a white astronaut from the original space sets, albeit with the SP Commando's helmet, and a new ray gun piece. The ray gun is a new piece, along with the shortened bar attached. The bar is basically a shortened lightsabre blade. This gives the effect of the gun shooting a laser. Because of the design of the barrel, you can also attach cones on it (like the old Star Wars guns). The ray gun also has two studs on the side. The only problems that i can think of for this minifig are:<br><ul><li>There is no back print on the minifig's torso</li><li>The minifig doesn't come with an airtank piece, which would have made it a lot better.</li></ul>Overall, i recommend this if you like Lego Space.

"sideswinger","2020-07-25T20:29:12.597Z","A pretty good figure!","<p>So the thirteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1 is the Spaceman, and for 2010, he is a nice figure. So let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that helmet piece, and it does look nice. I like how he can hold it on that handle below the visor, and the piece is made up of two parts; the helmet,&nbsp;and the smoky-gray visor. The piece has some nice moulding along the bottom too.</p>

<p>Then we have his face, which I do really like. I like that confident smile, as well as his confident eyebrow printing, and the cheekbones look cool as well. It&#39;s just a very neat face, if you ask me. No alternate face printing, which is common for these two dollar figures.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso, which has some very neat printing. I love that classic space logo on there, as well as those cables plugged up. It&#39;s just a highly detailed print. No back torso printing either.</p>

<p>Then he has some excellent leg printing, possibly the best in the series. I love the belt, as well as the boots on the feet. Then he has those lines on his knees as well. Just some really cool leg printing.</p>

<p>Then his accessory is just that ray gun with the translucent blue rod coming out of it. It is an extremely common piece in the world of CMF, and is probably the worst part of the figure. Still, it&#39;s okay. The gun part os caste in a metallic silver. Still, nothing real special, but oh well.</p>

<p>And my overall opinion is that the figure is pretty cool, for a few reasons. First off, he has some very nice parts and prints, with the helmet and legs, and just visually looks neat. Second, he&#39;s just a classic idea, and was a very popular theme with LEGO, so I like how he&#39;s a callback to classic LEGO space. And third, he&#39;s just a great choice. Me, along with any other kid in the universe, always wanted to go to space, and just about everyone wants to be an astronaut. And while he isn&#39;t exactly an astronaut (we had to wait until Series 15 for that), he&#39;s close enough.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for this review! SO don&#39;t forget to check out my other Series 1 reviews, and thanks for reading!!!</p>
