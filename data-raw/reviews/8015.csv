Even if you have old forest men!","While I was originally sceptical of the appeal of this figure (having already original Robin Hood style figures from the 90s) I changed my mind upon receiving this figure.<br><br>Pros: Compared to the originals, the figure's printing is far more advanced and detailed. It is of better quality, too. The hat has a feather in it and you have all the required accessories. The face of the figure is also unique and could have many possible uses.<br><br>Cons: the plastic quality is slightly worse.<br><br>Neutral: the hat is precisely the same as the one used for previous ""Robin Hoods"" in the 90s - which means he will not stand out when among them.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3

"Nesquik","2011-04-09T10:01:59.377Z","Original or New Forestman?","This must be a rare instance in which I'm not sure whether I prefer an original minifigure or its modern counterpart. The case this time is the Forestman - a chap who is obviously modeled around someone as brave or heroic as Robin Hood.<div><br></div><div>I should probably be concise - the only reason I'm fonder of the original Forestman (1992?) is because his attire is far more distinctive as its simpler. Whilst this particular minifigure is a very nice addition to the 'Series', I feel the amount of detail detracts from his authenticity. You may find that a strange argument, but if you compare both the original Forestman and this newer counterpart, the original has nicer colours and the simpler detail reflects the limited resources of living in the forest during this period.</div><div><br></div><div>So thats my argument, and I've no doubt that others will disagree which is fine. But personally, I would suggest buying the 'Vintage Minifigure Collection' that contains the original Forestman.</div>",TRUE,3,4,4,4,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure is great and I&nbsp; love the old&nbsp; the old school look and design. The cool bow and arrow piece and yet simple but effective torso printing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This figure goes extremly well with a castle or woodland setting. he is good in every way , apart from it is not great having duplicate numbers of this fig as unlike the Ninja's and spacemen it&nbsp; better off by himself. </p>

"The_Habuskian","2010-06-17T11:32:54.2Z","Forestman = Awesome!","<p>I bought this at my local TRU for 1.99 along with 4 others.&nbsp;It is one of the best of the collectable minifigure series. The face is beautiful, as is the torso and colour scheme. I really like&nbsp;as well because&nbsp;it feels and weighs slightly different to normal minifigures. My only problem with it is the bow, which looks a bit odd IMO, as it is pulled back. </p>",TRUE,5,5,3,2,4
"Master_Wu","2019-07-31T16:00:43.963Z","You will like it!","<p>This forestman is my favorite minifigure from series one! He has some excellent parts and some great play value if you put it with the rest of your castle sets! I really like the green hat with the feather on top! The torso has some excellent printing on the front. The only thing in this set that disappoints me is that the legs are plain green without any printing.</p>

<p>If you can find this minifigure for a few bucks, I would recommend that you get it.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-07-26T16:07:15.373Z","A MEH figure!","<p>So the fourteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1 is the Forestman, and this is a figure that for me isn&#39;t too great. But let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that hat, which is made up of two pieces; the hat, and the feather. And it is a sort of interesting, since it is a hat I haven&#39;t personally seen too often. It&#39;s never appeared in a CMF since, from my understanding. I do like the shaping of it as well, with that pointy front and all. And the red feather is another piece I haven&#39;t seen much. It does add a nice flare to the green hat as well.</p>

<p>Then we have his face, which looks pretty nice. I like that silly expression on it, with those eyebrows and beard. He also has a nice smirk on his face. I think it looks a little strange, but still, a nice print. He has no alternate face, which if he did, it would&#39;ve looked pretty strange.</p>

<p>And skipping that quiver, we have that pretty neat torso, which has some nice printing. I like that brown belt, as well as the white vest. His arms are a different color than his torso, to where they are that peach-ish color. No alternate torso printing, which I don&#39;t mind a bit since they would be covered by that quiver piece anyway.</p>

<p>And he does have some plain green legs, so there isn&#39;t a point in reserving a whole paragraph for them. Let&#39;s just talk about his two accessories. Using that neck attachment is that quiver piece, which is caste in a reddish brown. Nothing special, though I have always liked that piece overall. He also has that brown bow and arrow piece, which fits, but isn&#39;t too special. He actually has the same exact accessories as the Tribal Hunter, who&#39;s also in Series 1, so that&#39;s kind of interesting.</p>

<p>But as a whole, this figure isn&#39;t reallyone of the standouts for me. He isn&#39;t absolutely terrible, but I&#39;m just not too interested in him. He isn&#39;t my least favorite (my bottom three is the Demolition Dummy, Super Wrestler, and Ninja), but he is probably one of them. And I think that wraps up this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
