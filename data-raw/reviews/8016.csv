I have three of these so i made a diveing crew!! If you get him in a packet or from your friend you could put him in a sea MOC...<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Happy Hunting!!",TRUE,5,5,1,4,4
"United_Bricks","2011-09-04T10:43:04.29Z","Not the best, but cool","This minfigure was hard to get for me, I ended up getting it on ebay for the same price I think. Its a nice minifigure with some nice parts, most of them are old parts but just in orange. The helmet is a normal blue helmet with nice diving goggles attached to it. The head is not the best .The oxegen tank is orange instead of the boring dark grey one, I like it in orange. The torso is nice with a shark logo on it, also their is printing of a belt on it. The legs are blue with a orange stripe, finally the flipers are orange but they are not new beacause you could get them in the city coast guard line. Overall this minfigure is nice.<br>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,4
"Firox_5000","2010-10-04T14:54:37.047Z","Diving time!","<p>This is one of 16 figures in the series 1 collection. He has 8 pieces and does not take longer than 2 minutes to build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This figure has some really nice parts , cool flippers, helmet and printed chest.He very much looks like a casual diver. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This figure goes well with lego fcity fireman and coastguard sets as well as Atlantis and Aqua raiders.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,3

"SKip_E_Productions2","2011-02-27T17:48:50.753Z","OK.......","<p>i guess the deep sea diver is an okay minifig. ALTHOUGH i was after the ninja and skater, at least this one is cool too.&nbsp; </p>
<p>now onto the pros and cons: </p>
<p>pros: has cool new pieces </p>
<p>cons: why doesn't he come with a harpoon?&nbsp; </p>
<p>also, i think lego should've made new flippers. this way, he can wear the flippers and still stand on the display stand. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>overall it's a good set. but for $2-3, it's a little much. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>worth the money! but don't buy it since it isn't being sold anymore. </p>",TRUE,4,3,2,1,3
"rolomolo12345","2012-05-26T18:10:03.19Z","Diving into the Lego minifigure world!","<p>I like this set as it shows good&nbsp;quality's&nbsp;for minifigures for show and not just to be broken up and&nbsp;reassembled&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 This minifigure has a great colour scheme which shows the classic diver type man and the blueness of the diving suit</li><li>Pro 2 The detail on the&nbsp;initial&nbsp;diver's chest was very well done with lots of detail to draw the eye</li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 I think there could have been more added to this set, like a fish or something for the diver to hold</li><li>Con 2 The flippers can be help, but extremely hard to get them that way, and seem to be an annoyance</li><li>â€¦</li></ul>
<p>My conclusion is that Lego needed to add more detail onto the divers legs and arms to make it more authentic, but all an all, its a great addition to any Lego lovers collection, And i hope Lego will one day make the classic diver with the big metal suit on, that would be a good set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,2,3
"sideswinger","2020-07-27T02:59:32.48Z","A decent figure.","<p>So the fifteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 1 is the Deep Sea Diver, and he&#39;s okay to me. But let&#39;s take a closer look at him!</p>

<p>On top&nbsp;we have that snorkel, which is made up of two pieces; the helmet, and the goggles/snorkel. The helmet is caste in plain blue, and it has no printing on it. The goggles/snorkel part is caste in a translucent blue, and it&#39;s always a nice piece to get in a CMF. I think the figure comes with an extra as well, which is nice. Of course they stopped doing that in Series 2, and it returned in 2019.</p>

<p>Next we have that face print, which to me looks okay. I like the eyebrows and eyes, but the cheekbones look a little off to me. He has a nice smirk though. No alternate face printing, which is common for 2010.</p>

<p>Skipping that air tank, we have that nice torso print. I like how it came out, with that logo on his suit. I think that&#39;s appeared in some other LEGO System sets, but I might be wrong. He has some nice orange squiggly lines, as well as that nice black and gray belt. He has no back torso printing, which is also normal for 2010.</p>

<p>And, while he has zero printing, his legs are sort of interesting, to where the connector part is orange, while the two leg pieces are blue. But nothing else, therefore I&#39;m gonna move on to his accessories. I consider that air tank an accessory, and it does have that neck attachment. It is a very common piece, and to me is not all too exciting. Still, it&#39;s neat t get in a two dollar figure. But he also includes those two flipper pieces, which are orange this time around. Again, not that special,but sort of neat for a two dollar fig.</p>

<p>So my overall opinion is that this is okay. I think he is a great choice, since diving is sort of a thing people are interested in. He does look a little boring though, and reminds me of your typical LEGO City diver character. So, much like some others in the series, great choice, not-so-great execution. But I think that wraps up this review, so thanks for reading!!!</p>
