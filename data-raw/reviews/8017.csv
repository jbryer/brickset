Unlike Indy, who has painted torso, legs, AND waistband pieces, only the torso is painted on this cowboy.&nbsp; The detail on Cowboy's clothes is not as nice as the clothing on Indy, but the cowboy has both a bandolier with silver-colored bullets, and a big cow head belt buckle, also in silver.&nbsp; And finally, he comes with not just one six-shooter, but TWO.&nbsp; <br><br>My cowboy comes with an odd detail -- his left hand is noticeably shinier and more polished than his right hand, which has the same matte finish (these hands are both red-brown) as some of the other plastic pieces in the minifigure collection.&nbsp; It's kind of the same non-shiny finish as Indiana Jone's shoulder bag, but the plastic is not as flexible.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>One other thing; I like the painting job on the cowboy's face.&nbsp; He has laugh lines around his eyes, and nice thick brown eyebrows, light brown sideburns, and very tiny dots of stubble on his lower face.&nbsp;&nbsp; So all in all, what with the useful fedora and TWO guns, as well as the nice paint job, it's a good figure after all.<br>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,4
"brixton","2010-05-29T07:17:02.42Z","A Good Old Fashioned Western Showdown","When I was scrolling through the images of the mini-figures, the cowboy was one of the sets I did not want.&nbsp; This is because it seemed like an uninspired version of the Indiana Jones mini-figure and I already have a few Indiana Jones mini-figures which already look like cowboys.&nbsp; As a result, I was not interested in this set.&nbsp; I ended up getting it and absolutely love it!<br><br>The cowboy comes with a tan fedora and three guns.&nbsp; Since none of the City Police Officers carry guns, I was going to give the extra gun to one of my police mini-figures.&nbsp; The torso is painted with a jacket and a dress shirt underneath.&nbsp; He has a belt with rounds in it and a traditional cowboy belt.&nbsp; The color scheme works very well in this set.<br>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"spokeydokeyjenner_jones","2010-07-26T06:57:47.823Z","Awesome minifigure I've ever got!","<p>This is one of the best mini-figs I&#39;ve got!<br />
<br />
I look the detail on it, even the bull&#39;s head belt buckle explains that he must be from Texas. The face is almost close to that of Clint Eastwood, but it looks like he&#39;s got a lot of confidence. Sure, it has the same Indy fedora in dark tan, but it looks the part, alright; for mine, I modified a regular white cowboy hat and rescuplted it into the sort of hat Randolph Scott would have worn. It may not come with a bandana, but I decided to include one with it. He&#39;s supposed to be a good guy, so I&#39;d choose either red or white. If you got any horses with a saddle, I&#39;d recommend a white horse and brown saddle.<br />
<br />
So it&#39;s a great mini-fig. I&#39;d recommend it to any LEGO Wild West fan.</p>

"Firox_5000","2010-10-04T14:14:11.523Z","Clint brickwood","<p>This is one of the 16 figures available in the series 1 minifigures. You get 7 pieces and the build takes no longer than 2 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This figure is not a bad one,it's a cowboy. The figure has a classic cowboy hat,double revolvers and some neat printing a bit similar to the indy fig. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure does not have any unique parts but&nbsp; nicely resembles a classic cowboy figure. The figure has pretty good playability with other figures and goes quite well with the series 2 mexican which you could have an encounter with them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall he is not the best series 1 fig but he is definately not the worst. I give him 7/10,</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,3

though they've both been ""released"" before, I found them to have just 
the right amount of balance of the old, combined with the new.<br><br>Like others, I thought ""Its no better than the Indiana Jones minifig."" I was wrong---maybe because of the twin revolvers, the light-brown hat, or the bull belt buckle. Or maybe because of the bullet holder sling thing.<br><br>I wouldn't have made the side-burns so long, but otherwise great minifig.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"United_Bricks","2011-09-04T10:55:06.063Z","Nice","This minifure was the first ever collectible minifigure I got, I now have two of them in my collection. This minifiure was a nice minifure and has some nice parts.<br>The hat is like the one you get with Indiana Jones but this one is lighter brown, I like the hat and the colour. The head is a nice western face with stuble and a chessy grin and sideburns. The torso has a strip what holds his bullets in, printed on his torso, he also has a slightly unbuttend shirt and a bull logo buckal. His legs are brown. He has two dark grey revolvers. <br>Overall this minfigure is nice.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,4
"AETerry","2011-04-18T23:03:49.66Z","Cowboy Review","<p>With the fact that he's carrying two pistols (and my package came with a third), I'd almost refer to this minifig as a Gunslinger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plastic on par with the Nurse minifigure I've got and not nearly as good a plastic as minifigures from later series. Still, he's a good classic image of a cowboy who's combination of accessories and print job for the torso make the mini. The hat is a light tan version of Indiana Jone's Dark Brown Fedora. The mini's head looks alright. And the torso is a decent print with the big silver cattle buckler, bandolier of bullets and shirt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's lots you can do with this mini, especially if you'd ever collected any of the Western Theme. But I like him and he's good enough to set up on my shelf.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,5,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cowboy is a fairly basic Mini-Fig to have, but he looks pretty darn impressive for a Western Themed figure. He's wearing dark brown gloves and a light brown jacket, the print features a big Texan long-horn belt buckle and a bandolier with bullets for his pistols. He comes with a Indy style hat and three pistols, giving you an extra one for other Western Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His facial print is quite unique too and has a bit of stubble, plus some rich brown side-burns and a great looking smirk. Overall I'd say this Cowboy Mini-Figure is a great addition to any Western Town or Scene and he's a must have figure.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"sideswinger","2020-07-27T16:39:51.79Z","Great choice, bad execution","<p>So the sixteenth and final figure of the LEGO Minifigures Series 1 is the Cowboy, and he&#39;s a figure that I&#39;m not all too keen of. But let&#39;s take&nbsp;a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting from the top, we have that cowboy hat, and the piece itself looks pretty neat. It isn&#39;t a rare part whatsoever, but fits the figure nicely. Its color though, is a color I haven&#39;t really seen for it. It is just that light brown, which might be an exclusive color for him. Don&#39;t quite me on that though.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which does look great. I love that smile, and I also love the brown sideburns. He has that beard as well, which is made up of lots of dots. He has no alternate face, as that would look pretty strange from the back, and it&#39;s only a two dollar figure.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, which looks okay. I like that big silver belt buckle, as well as that light brown&nbsp;jacket. He also has that strap full of what appears to be bullets for his pistols. No printing on his back, which is sort of inconsistent with the strap. But oh well.</p>

<p>And since his legs are just plain brown with no printing, let&#39;s talk about his pistols. He comes with 3 (on is an extra). And I&#39;m not sure if they were new for the figure or not. I would normally say they weren&#39;t, but who knows. They do fit the figure though, and they look good as well.</p>

<p>So my overall opinion&nbsp;is that this is a great choice for a first series, but I just think he came out&nbsp;a little bit boring. So, like tons of others in the series, great choice, bad execution. But I think that wraps up this review! I have reviewed all the other Series 1 figures, so check them out, and I hope this helped you decide whether you wanted to pay&nbsp;top dollar for it on Ebay. So thanks for reading!</p>
