<p>2 extra pieces clear green stud and a green base black antenna.</p>
<p>piced up 4 of these so i would have extra little green men. great for kids. </p>
<p>minifigure seems like it is a lower quality plastic. not your normal lego look either.</p>
<p>i would buy again though</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"asianlego","2011-08-21T00:24:03.123Z","You Know You Bought It Because It's Cheap","First of all, let me give a little piece of advice to you guys - it's not worth your money to spend up to USD10 on this little set. Just look at the ad prices listed here. I would suggest that you go down to your local Target, Walmart, or K-Mart and look for the polybags hanging at the checkout counters alongside the gift cards and breath mints. There'll usually be several Lego polybags hanging there - mostly the Atlantis and Ninjago sets, but there might be this set too. All for only USD3.99. Without tax, of course.<div><br></div><div>On to the review.</div><div><br></div><div>This set is actually a smaller version of the 7595 set. The only difference between that and this set is that this one only contained one army figurine and the jeep is not as detailed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To be honest I only bought it because I was far too cheap to buy the aforementioned 7595 set. I wouldn't find much use for a company of green Lego soldiers - and then there's this set. And hey, it's only USD3.99.</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,2,5
"legojoker89","2011-02-19T21:09:26.25Z","At the store COUNTER!!","<p>I got this set at the check out and it is actually really weird! there is not much to it but it is dirt cheap!<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro Good for Minifigure/Vehicle Collection<br></li><li>Pro Nice Little Car and Figure with a stand and Walkie Talkie </li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con Really Small<br></li><li>Con has no steering wheel</li></ul>
<p>get it if you have a few bucks but it WON'T be that rare or worth that much!<br></p>",TRUE,3,2,2,1,3
"legodude357","2011-04-07T09:29:37.283Z","Very expensive for what's in the package!","<p>I got this at target at the checkout. It rung up $4.99. IMHO that's is far too much for whats inside this poly-bag.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The poly-bag feels cheap like it would come open at any moment. The instructions were simple, only because this is a small model. They are just a fold out piece of paper with maybe five steps for a ten step model. I am an expert builder so I was able to build this without the simplified instructions, but newcomers will have trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; On the back of the instructions is a small ad for other toy story sets, and the URL for the official toy story Lego web site.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Not all the parts are green some are gray and some are black, but there's really not that many. You get some tires and axles, plus an extra one of those stands to put the green army men on. I really don't use those though.</p><p>If you were to take this apart you wouldn't have a lot to build with. Not really good for someone starting out in Lego's.<br></p>
<h4>Mini-figures<br></h4><p>You get one mini-figure, who feels cheap and fragile like those Chinese mini-figures in different sets like the board games. It feels as though if I press too hard on his chest it will crack. And if I swivel his arm it might become lose and have no grip, and thus, no pose-ability.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is short and not very sweet. It's just a car, like in the bigger toy story army men set. You stack some plates and put on the front grille piece along with some lights. Whoop-Dee-do! We see this in every Lego car ever made. :P<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is just a smaller version of the toy story army men set, which is still available. It has two extra pieces, a black wire piece, and a translucent green stud. To make the model better, all they need to do is add&nbsp; a green shotgun and lower the price $2-$3. Presto! It would be a perfect impulse then.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In my opinion, save the money, and buy the larger army man set. It is only twice as much, but you get more figures, a better jeep, and more accessory's. You may disagree with me but I say to buy that instead and I would not recommend this to a friend. Thank you for reading my first negative review!</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,3,2,2,1,2
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-07-24T14:32:39.43Z","On sale? Yes. MSRP? Maybe...","<p>I picked this little set at the same time I did <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=30042-1"">30042</a> (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=40828"">review!</a>). It's an OK set. The end result is just a little green jeep without a steering wheel, and an army man with a stand and walkie talkie. Neat little figure.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Army Man with Walkie Talkie</li><li>Nice little Jeep</li><li>Wonderful Green!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Costs about a third of Army Men on Patrol, but has way less value</li><li>The Antenna on the back of jeep doesn't stay on well</li><li>No steering wheel?</li></ul><div>30071 is an OK set. It's a cheap way to get an Army Man, but if you're looking to build an army you should get the Army Men on Patrol set instead- it's 10.99, about 2.5 times as much as this set, and you get 3 more army men, a better jeep, and a stretcher. I do however like the green- it is after all, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fR6bjcJ7vY"">a better color for better building</a>. Overall, it's a fine set, but better on sale.</div>",TRUE,3,4,2,2,3
"tkettle9719","2011-12-27T10:16:07.567Z","Impressive for an Impulse...","<p>I happened to get this set, along with the mini X-Wing, at Target, where this one cost me about four dollars. While this set is quite well done, there are some flaws.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The jeep itself is small, and well-built.<br></li><li>-The amount of green parts is extremely exciting, and if you hate Toy Story, you get a lot of spare greens.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Miscolored pieces, such as the wheels, tires, and the""radiator grille"" in the front detract from the green awesomeness of this model.<br></li><li>-As a fan of Toy Story (and Pixar, in general,) it bothers me as an individual that you have to take off the foot piece (Figure-80 looking piece) for the little army man to get into the jeep.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is a great, cheap buy that can be a great substitute for the larger jeep, but overall, I think that, due to the amount of figures, accessories, and the overall size of the jeep, that this jeep is not as good as the larger boxed one. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
