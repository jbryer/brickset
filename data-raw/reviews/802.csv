<p>First you have the small ultralite type aircraft which does&nbsp;vaguely resembles a dragonfly.&nbsp; It is done in a sharp red and white color scheme with a blue wind screen and blue detail stcker on the tail.&nbsp; The wings swing back for when the truck is towing it.&nbsp; The engine is also nicely detailed.</p>

<p>Next there is the truck.&nbsp; It is a small&nbsp;pick-up truck that matches the aircraft&#39;s colors.&nbsp;The front end is a bit awkward, but overall it is nicely designed.&nbsp; There are holders for a wrench and a hammer.&nbsp; The truck tows a trailer used to tow the plane.</p>

<p>Last, there is a small yellow tractor.&nbsp; It pulls a trailer with two fuel canisters in the Octan colors.</p>

<p>There are two figures: the pilot/truck driver (who comes with both hair and a helmet) and a mechanic.</p>

<p>Overall, a nice set.</p>
