"AZFIREWOLF","2010-06-30T09:23:57.75Z","A great set, but is it really for playing with?","<p>I bought my shuttle on Sunday and built it on Monday morning. </p>
<p>It is a nice build. Took me about 2hrs to build it. You first start off with the shuttle and then move your way to the rocket boosters. </p>
<p>The shuttle is a true shuttle. Thou I wish it would have come with a few more items and a little more details. (I would have loved to have seen a EAV suit for the figures)</p>
<p>The arm doesn't stand up when you attach the satellite. The satellite is a little heavy compared to the old shuttle sets. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you get the set built and you have the launch pad ready for the shuttle to stand on it is really cool. It reminds me of my childhood seeing the shuttle launches on TV. </p>
<p>It would have been cool to have Lego build a whole launch center for the set, but it is what it is. I guess my imagination is going to be working on overload. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set does come with a number of extra parts. I counted at leat 20 extra small pieces. Adding those into the extra part bings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is expensive, but it comes with a lot of great parts. I for one want to buy 2 more. One for storage and one to sell in the future. This set is going to become a collectors item one day. Some people may be buying hundreds of these to try and sell them in the future, but I don't need to be greedy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get a chance to buy one buy it. You don't want to miss this set. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,3
"Monty","2010-07-05T12:20:20.24Z","A Worthwhile Endeavour","<p>As a huge fan of rockets and other spacecraft, as soon as I knew this was going to be available I was literally on a countdown until launch day. I purchased mine at my local Lego store last week, and made it over the weekend. &nbsp;It now sits proudly with the rest of my Lego space collection which includes Apollo Saturn V, the large Lunar Module (on Brickshelf) and Delta rocket and launch tower.</p>
<p>There are 2 instruction books. The first covers the camera man and his buggy and equipment (did not make this, and he and the bricks have gone straight to the spares box) before going on to the orbiter. By the end of the book you are still only half way through the orbiter which continues into book 2 which also contains instructions for the external tank (ET), solid rocket boosters (SRBs) and the launch platform with its searchlights.</p>
<p>Features of the orbiter are spring loaded undercarriage front and rear. Whilst this allows the orbiter to sit with its distinctive nose down attitude it comes at the price of having holes in the wings when down and they are visible through and above the wings when retracted. &nbsp;The front undercarriage is a bit too spring loaded for my liking, plus the front wheels which castor can only be retracted when they are facing backwards so it is necessary to point the nose of the shuttle downwards so the front wheel swivels round to face backwards under gravity, before turning the operating lever found on both sides to get it to retract. It is also set well back from where it should be as per prototype where the nose wheel is very far forward – still compromises have to be made to get it retracting. &nbsp;Main engines can actually move just like the real thing – watch any launch and you will see the engines go through a gimbal sequence prior to lift off. Master stroke of genius was to use white cockpit elements to provide the distinctive rear fairings to the orbital manoeuvring system (OMS) – it looks so good. Again the smaller engines here can be moved from side to side. The hinged cargo bay doors work well, but as the elements to make them are only 1 stud wide building can get a little monotonous. Then it is onto the cockpit which includes some s.n.o.t. techniques to provide sufficient room to accommodate the 2 astronauts. NASA Shuttle crews wear orange suits so it would have been better if they were in orange, but perhaps this is because it not supposed to be a NASA machine? I say this because there are no NASA logos, but there is U.S. flag, but no “United States” for the sides. &nbsp;That said there is no way a full crew complement of 7 Minifig scale would ever fit. You have to have the 2 astronauts you get staggered one behind the other to get them to fit. A section of fuselage above the cockpit lifts off to reveal the astronauts and flight deck and other computer bricks. The cockpit glazing and surrounding could do with a few tweaks to improve accuracy and the black/white combination around the nose can be changed for more accuracy. A sticker for the entrance hatch on the left hand side would have been good as it is such a distinctive feature. The ports on the nose for the Forward Reaction Control System (RCS) are a represented with a sticker, and I can’t see any other way of doing this. Next you construct the satellite followed by the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) or “arm” for short for handing payloads. I concur with the previous writer the satellite is large with folding solar panels (large stickers) and consequently, because it is not weightless here on Earth, the arm cannot hold it without collapsing. Could try and stiffen up the joints I guess.</p>
<p>Next up is the External Tank. This is basically a large hollow cylinder made from curved red brown components with grey for support and brown for the levels where the attachment points are fixed for the external piping, SRBs and the orbiter. The nose of the tank is made from curved plates and works well and feels sturdy enough. Not sure why brown was used for detailing here as buff or tan coloured bricks would be more accurate to prototype. I am not sure why the bottom of the tank is grey rather than red brown. The SRB’s and the orbiter clip on to the tank to make a fairly sturdy construction which will stand its own weight on the launch platform, which is the final item in the instruction booklet, together with its floodlights. Top of SRBs should be white not black cones, these can be changed if you have the right parts – so far I don’t. &nbsp;At the other end (and on the main engines) I left off the bright transparent orange circular 1x1 plates supposed to represent rocket exhaust – in my view they make it look too toy like. &nbsp;I also increased the height of the ET and adjusted the attachment points of the SRBs and ET relative to each other to try and get the proportions more accurate and compensate for the orbiter being slightly larger than it should be. Having aired my minor gripes, the set looks superb when set up in launch configuration on the launch platform – your visitors will be impressed.I have produced a modified thicker mobile launch platform rather than rely on the flimsy thin base plate provided in the set, and i have to say it looks all the better for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure why this shuttle is called “Adventure” or there are no NASA logos and real shuttle names to choose from. On my previous space sets NASA logos were reproduced. I decided to do my shuttle as OV-105 Endeavour because she was the last to be built, and will possibly be last to fly in 2011, but i now hear congress may stump up&nbsp;for one extra additional mission.&nbsp;I also actually saw her night launch on STS-113 - an amazing site I will never forget. I didn’t know it then, but this was the last successful mission before the loss of Columbia on the next mission, which grounded the fleet for a couple of years – and I also think hastened their early retirement. This meant I had to produce my own stickers for the&nbsp;orbiter rather than all of the ones provided, but at those from the set I did use on the satellite are of the plastic film variety rather than the paper ones which love to disintegrate and peel off after a couple of years, so hopefully they will last.</p>
<p>My congratulations to the Lego design team; you have produced something to be proud of. It is an enjoyable build, looks pretty accurate and includes working features for play value. And we get all this for 80 G.B.P.&nbsp; – I thought it would cost at least 100 before I knew the price. &nbsp;This is up there with my all time favourite non Star Wars set, the Fokker DR1 “Red Baron” Triplane, and maybe for playability even tops it. That said, I shall just have mine proudly on display. More like this please Lego, accurate models of real prototypes. &nbsp;I award this set a maximum score in all categories.</p>

"DrOrrery","2011-02-08T08:18:35.477Z","My favourite set in 30 years of lego building","<p>I think this may be the best lego set ever produced. &nbsp;Sounds like overkill, I know, but hear me out.</p><p><br></p><p>I was a huge lego fan as a kid into my teenage years and I lived through the golden age of Lego. &nbsp;Thanks to my wonderful Mum I still have all my old sets, castle, space, train, technic, relatively intact. &nbsp;In 2010, with 2 children of my own who are still too young to play with proper lego, I got all my old lego down from my parents' attic and put it together to see what was missing. &nbsp;And suddenly I was addicted to lego again. &nbsp;I've made some big purchases, King's Castle to make up for years spent pining after the old lions castle which I never got, Admirals Flagship, again because I always wanted the original Black Seas Barracuda but by that stage was into technic, and Emerald Night which goes well with the heap of old train lego I've got. &nbsp;Brilliant sets, every bit as good as or maybe even better than the ones I played with as a kid. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So I've seen some of the best new sets, and I've got a lot of very cool old sets. &nbsp;But the Space Shuttle Adventure is just something else entirely. &nbsp;It has the beauty of the best models, the detail of the best technic and the playability of all the best old space sets. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Beauty - This set is gorgeous. &nbsp;Maybe I'm biased a little because of my love of the real Space Shuttle, but even so it's undeniable that with it's clean lines this model is wonderful to look at. &nbsp;Perhaps the best part is the way it stands upright in the launch bay. &nbsp;It just looks right.</li><li>Detail - The boosters and main tank, landing gear, adjustable rockets, flaps, cargo bay and the satellite and arm, all of these are wonderful touches. &nbsp;Several of them are extremely clever as well, like the spring loaded landing gear.</li><li>Playability - This model is solid. &nbsp;You don't want to drop the boosters and main tank, although if they do break they are very quick to put back together. &nbsp;But the shuttle proper is a very well constructed piece, and is highly swooshable.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Is it perfect? &nbsp;Nothing is ever perfect, and there are a couple of niggles, but they are minor. &nbsp;Actually, the only real issues are with the satellite and the arm. &nbsp;The satellite has an antenna that comes of every time you look at it, they probably shouldn't have tried to put that on. &nbsp;And the arm can barely hold it's own weight, let alone the satellite. &nbsp;Of course, the real arm can't hold it's weight in earth's gravity, but the point of the toy is to pretend to be in space. &nbsp;Still, these are incredibly minor niggles, and I'm somewhat amazed and very happy that they even got a satellite in the cargo bay.</li></ul><ul><li><br></li></ul>
<p>This set is brilliant. &nbsp;I can honestly say that were I given the choice between the Galaxy Explorer and the Space Shuttle Adventure, I would choose the Space Shuttle. &nbsp;Anything that can compete with 25 years of dreams planted in the mind of a young boy must be a little incredible. &nbsp;This set is a classic and, in case it isn't obvious, I highly recommend it.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

Shortly thereafter I constructed a number of different versions of the Shuttle ""stack"" for myself, using the parts in my collection...needless to say the result wasn't as good as any of the current and past offerings from Lego, but it was all this 12-year old needed.&nbsp;<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "">In later years I have picked up just about all of the ""official"" Lego versions of the shuttle, culminating in the Christmas gift of set 10213 by my wife...<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "">Anyways...<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "">This set was fun to build, although I would say that the addition of operating landing gear added some questionable complexity to the build. Operating gear on this model is certainly a nice feature, but I found it to be a bit fragile to raise/lower once the model was finished. On top of that, the main gear is visible between the fuselage and the wings when retracted- again, not a really huge deal but I found it distracting. The model also features operating flaps on the trailing edges of the wing, another nice feature to have. One other thing I noticed was that the shuttle's nose profile was a bit off- yes I realize that it isn't easy to model all these complex curves using bricks. Just my opinion that this portion could have been done a bit differently. Also, the two astronaut minifigs included sit in a cockpit with very small windows, and in fact you'd never even know they are in there just by looking at the orbiter.&nbsp;<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "">The remainder of the kit was nice, although I did find the solid rocket boosters (SRB's) to be undersized in both circumference and height- with the latter being more noticeable. The way they went together was rather innovative (to me) and the result was quite solid.&nbsp;<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ""><br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "">The external fuel tank also has, in my opinion, profile issues at the very top.

"monkyby87","2019-07-29T18:18:46.907Z","Great display piece and set, but quite delicate","<p>This Shuttle Adventure set is a great model that looks great on display.&nbsp; It features the Space Shuttle, the two booster rockets and the fuel tank.&nbsp; In addition, there is a base for it to stand on, 4 light stands and 3 mini figures with a small transport car.&nbsp; Inside the shuttle itself is a satellite with an arm to put in space.&nbsp; All of the pieces seem to be quite accurate and are unmistakable for being that of a real space shuttle vehicle.</p>

<p>The base though is not representative of anything used in real life, and is merely meant to display the shuttle in its standing position, ready to launch.&nbsp; The shuttle fits neatly on it, but it&#39;s one large base plate that is quite flimsy in the middle.&nbsp; As such, it must be displayed on a flat surface (recommended for Lego in general) and not moved around much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shuttle vehicle itself has 3 wheels that can retract for landing, the cargo bay as mentioned above for the satellite, and a cockpit that fits the two astronauts.&nbsp; However, the figures do not fit very well and have to be moved around a bit for the canopy to be securely shut.&nbsp; There&#39;s simply very little room inside, but at this scale it would have been hard to overcome that.&nbsp; The shuttle and the two booster rockets fit onto the fuel tank via technic pins.&nbsp; This works fine, but it leads to my biggest issue with this set; stability.&nbsp; Frankly, this set is very fragile and not very secure.&nbsp; Any amount of handling with this model can lead to pieces coming lose.&nbsp; Several times when trying to attach either the rockets or the shuttle something would come lose, or the fuel tank itself would start to separate.&nbsp; Because of this, this is a great set for display, but not play.&nbsp; I would not recommend this set to be played with all that much.</p>

<p>NOTE: A revision of this set was released in 2011 called Shuttle Expedition.&nbsp; It&#39;s almost identical except it has two support beams of some kind between the booster rockets and the fuel tank.&nbsp; These supposedly help with stability issues.&nbsp; This revision was done purposely due to complaints about stability, as I too have experienced.&nbsp; However, I do not have that model so I can not attest that design and if it helps or not.&nbsp; Given the choice, I suppose I would recommend that revised model as opposed to this one.</p>

<p>Obviously then this set is not to scale with the mini figures.&nbsp; The micro figures that came with the recent Saturn V are a good size.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if the shuttle is really to scale with the Saturn V rocket set or not, but they seem to be pretty close, so I think displaying them next to each other would look fine.</p>

<p>Overall I really like this set.&nbsp; It looks great on display and is one of the most accurate Space Shuttle sets Lego has made.&nbsp; However, it&#39;s really only good for display and not for playing with.&nbsp; I would still recommend it, but if you&#39;re buying for a kid I might consider a different shuttle set.</p>

<p>Building-wise back then, it was a challenge. I was introduced to techniques I hadn&#39;t seen before in other sets, as this was my first big LEGO set. Completing it felt like I&#39;d accomplished something great. However, let&#39;s not dwell on nostalgia any more and look at this set with fresh eyes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s outdated. The shuttle especially looks incomplete with rows of exposed studs and an almost blocky front nose. Also, the exposed landing gear does look weird. While the boosters and fuel tank fare better, it was a challenge getting them to stay upright when connected to the baseplate and the process of disconnecting them from the shuttle remains tough. Of course, I have to mention how fragile the fuel tank was and its tendency to fall apart if handled wrong. I actually had to place bricks inside connecting the sections together in an attempt to fix it.</p>

<p>The astronaut minifigures remain a highlight of the set with some great detail. You do get another news figure but he&#39;s not really needed.</p>

<p>Overall, this was a great set for 2010. It remains the only shuttle of this scale to include the boosters and fuel tank (not counting the re-release of this set) and remains a solid display piece. I&#39;d don&#39;t know if I&#39;d recommend getting it now, simply because there are other, better shuttles out there.</p>
