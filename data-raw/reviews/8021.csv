"TooMuchLEGO","2011-03-06T17:25:07.65Z","Good set","20017 is a Brickmaster set only available for BrickMaster customers or if you got the Best of Brickmaster 2010 (in my case). This set was actually quite good though small. Dastan is a pretty good figure who is pretty similar to the actor he is based on, though unlike his other minifigures he is scabbard-less. Two snakes are also included to injure Dastan. I thought that it was cool how you got two Daggers of Time- for time paradoxes, I guess? The actually set part also pays homage to the game the movie was based on too! Anyway, it's a good set with good playability, and if you find for cheap online, I recommend getting it.",FALSE,4,4,4,4,5
