Except this, if you compare the lions battle-pack with the dragons you can easily see the lack of at least an armour for the knight. I would have also put a different helmet for the knight, I mean the one you can find in set 7947. The price is still a little bit high... if you think that the set 7949 gives you 3 minifig, a horse and the cart for almost 9 euros... anyway, the set itself is a must-have to enrich your battlefield!",FALSE,4,4,1,5,3
"Firox_5000","2012-01-07T17:05:43.51Z","It's Knight time ","<p>This set is a battle pack of the good knights of the Kingdoms range and contains 5 different knight figures for £8.99. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build is completely easy because the figures have already been constructed making the building process more or less eliminatd. The figures all contain contrasting and apporpiate parts for their weaponry and are all well equiped. There are not unique parts in this kit however the set comes with five fairly nice knight minifigures with shiny metalic helmets. </p>
<p>The playability of this set on it's own is rather limited due to having no objects,vehicles or structures around making them boring. In attempt to beefen up their play value, I would recommend buying the dragon knight battle pack as well and/or buying other kingdom sets. </p>
<p>This set for £8.99 is a touch on the pricey side seeing as this is non licensed lego and you get only 5 figures for the price and £6.99 would be a more reasonable price. </p>
<p>In summary, I would only really recommend getting this set if youre a hardcore Kingdom/castle fan who is interested in getting the knights to increase playability or artilary in certain kingdom settings/sets e.g the Kings Castle. If you want a Kingdom set to play with straight away of a similar price, I would suggest the Blacksmith shop or the Prison carriage resque as both are small and very cheap to buy.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,2
