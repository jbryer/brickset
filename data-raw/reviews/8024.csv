"wouterdb","2010-07-30T10:51:10.587Z","Good army builder","<p>This set is a very good expansion to your Kingdoms collection.</p>
<p>A few cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>- no dark grey weapons for the dragon soldiers (the other sets do have dark grey swords etc)</li>
    <li>- one knight with a lance but no horse</li>
    <li>- only greens flags, no second gold flags</li>
</ul>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,4
"IndyAJD","2011-03-01T18:28:28.33Z","You and what army?  Oh, this army.","<p>This set a great <b>addition </b>to any lego Kingdoms set. &nbsp;Its seriously overpriced, but I think its worth it. &nbsp;Its good to have because the regular sets usually come with less Dragon knights than Lion knights. &nbsp;Now for the pros/cons.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Love the elite dragon knights!</li><li>The mace-man is good to have.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Comes pre-built, thus the ""building experience"" rating (depending on your opinion, this may not be a con...)</li><li>Whats up with the lance?</li><li>The price...</li><li>Another archer might be nice, but no big deal.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Well you may be saying ""There are 2 pros, 4 cons, uh...might not want to get this one."" &nbsp;But I would definitely recommend this, despite the price.</div>",TRUE,4,5,1,5,3
"iamcjb","2011-01-07T11:41:38.487Z","Good variety of troops","I recently returned to Lego and after receiving a great chess set decided knights would be the way. I immediately ordered these guys as they look like great minifigs, and I saw the lack of Dragons in buildings sets was upsetting for any future evil warlords.<div><br></div><div><b>Pros</b></div><div><br></div><div>5 dragon troops. Generally the other sets contain more Lion Knights than Dragon Knights so they are a good boost for the greens</div><div>Lots of variety:</div><div>5 different weapons</div><div>3 different helmets</div><div>A cape</div><div>Body armour</div><div>3 different torsos</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cons</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Only one colour of flag. I have seen &nbsp;other sets of this faction with yellow/gold flags.</div><div>No horse for the jousting knight</div><div>Nothing to build</div><div><br></div><div>Overall a great set for boosting your Dragon army to balance the power versus the Lions, but obviously it's not time consuming build wise.</div>",TRUE,3,3,1,5,3
"pippodream","2011-02-06T17:35:18.01Z","Dragons are ready to kick  ass!","The Dragon battle-pack includes five soldiers with different weapons. Pretty cool the two new helmets and the armour of the knight: I gave to this pack one more brick regarding the parts with respect to the lions pack because of the presence of these items. I think it is worth to buy this set, even for the few dragons minifigs available in the other sets of the series. ",FALSE,4,5,1,4,4
