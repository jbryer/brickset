I say 'branding' because, for all it's worth, minifigures are about the most inefficient design you could wish for when making ice cubes, and this is reflected by the speed in which they melt compared to the more traditional cuboid shapes.<div><br></div><div>Another caveat is that once you've put your 'ice-figures' into a drink, they lack any real resemblance to minifigures as the only sections visible above the waterline are the torso, the tops of the feet and a little bit of the head.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But you're not restricted to just making ice cubes; you can also use chocolate and other liquids. Naturally I'm not going to encourage the use of alcohol cubes as there are, as Qui-Gon-Gin would say, ""younglings"" about, but chocolate Lego men are definitely unusual and, of course, cheap to make.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the product is silicone, the moulds are removed with relative ease. But in short, this is definitely something that you're only going to buy if you're truly dedicated fan.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
