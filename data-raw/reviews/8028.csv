<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is a large cardboard box with a plastic lid and it is very suitable for storage later. Though I kept having to remind my daughter not to sit on or stand in the box. <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There 1600 various colored bricks and elements in this set. Most of the pieces are what I call basic bricks from 1x1 bricks to 2x8 bricks, all various colors. And there is plenty to keep building. And it's perfect for my daughter to feel she has her own bricks to play with while Mommy is busy building her models and sets or MOCs so I don't have to go looking into her bucket to see if she's picked up a particular piece I need.</p><p>Depending on the Collector and LEGO Enthusiast, this box of bricks is perfect too for amassing a bulk collection of bricks to work with for various projects.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>There are no minifigures with this set as it's all just various bricks and elements.<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Ultimately as this set is very much so free form, there are no instructions or idea book. It's up to the imagination of the child playing with this set.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In the end I'd say this is a good choice for my daughter, she's spent several hours already with her bricks and building, constructing a house for some other dolls to play in. $30 U.S. was well spent for the number of pieces.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"DocDanCan","2012-01-03T20:38:24.507Z","Fantastic Set","<p>As a kid, I grew up with a large bucket full of Lego bricks that I regularly assembled into anything my agile young mind desired. (And then, of course, I took the whole things apart brick by brick, and yes, I used my teeth!) I know that, twenty years later, those bricks are still at my parent's house in stellar condition, except for a fine layer of dust. I have often thought that I would LOVE to have a bunch of bricks for my own (future) children to stimulate their budding imaginations. It wasn't until Black Friday that I stumbled upon some great deals on <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6177-1"">6177-1: Basic Bricks Deluxe</a>. I picked up two of those at O.P. Taylors and was very happy with my purchase. However, a few weeks later in Wal-Mart I ran across this box, and I could not believe my eyes. I didn't know boxes of Legos this size still existed! I was floored to find it was still running for $30, and I snagged the last box on the shelf. I could not be more excited about this set! I would not say that the more modern sets are restrictive or do not encourage young minds, but I have definitely found that a large amount of loose bricks tend to spark a fire in the kindling of tender, imaginative brains. I was lucky enough to attend a Lego KidsFest in Raleigh, NC, and the creations that kids - and I mean young kids! - made all over the arena put my puny attempts at something unique to shame. The best part was there was not a single minifigure being used, no special parts, just bricks and plates and a few other pieces, and it was still fantastic. I think that goes to show that a set like this NEEDS to always be in circulation! I think this set would go great with the Lego Idea Book (which I received for Christmas!)<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>HUGE amount of bricks<br></li><li>Durable box, durable bricks for the next generation of builders</li><li>No instructions, no limitations<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Not many plates<br></li><li>Not as many colors/variety of colors as set #6177. <br></li><li>No wheels/doors/windows, etc.<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall, I would consider this one of my best purchases of the year, and I have bought an ungodly amount of sets in the past 12 months! If you happen across one of these beauties, don't hesitate to purchase it, or make a mental note to hunt one down around Black Friday/early December of next year.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
