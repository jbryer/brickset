This is a nice little set and for sometime could be gotten from S@H, Lego stores and some retailers. I missed this first time around due to stupidly having a dark age and not getting any Lego at all. Since correcting this I am glad to see that it has been released. This is a nice little set that just looks good. Although smaller than the the current line of big rig type vehicles in  Lego Land it still has it's uses in the city line. I added to mine a little flat bed trailer and now it's used to haul around the Cabin Cruiser set. If you can find this set I would recommend getting it if for no other reason than to have a set that brings back good old Lego memories.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The roof is just a colored cockpit, so it is very easy to get the driver in and out.  The horns and bar pipes are quite interesting and are only used in this set.  The exhaust pipes are cool too.  There is a little bit of room in the cabin so that you can store accessories and what not.  This is a very realistic looking truck, and I'd say the only flaw is that it doesn't come with a trailer.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Second, it has alot of detail for a small set which never happens very often. The minifig is also a good part of this set too. No wonder this set was rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

How does it fare up against the time?
Well, to put it simple: it's quite bland, especially when you don't stick the stickers. It's okay, but that's it. It's just a truck. While it does feature a few nice details, it pales when put near one of nowadays trucks.
At last it features a good pieces choice, and the chrome parts are what avoid this model to be too forgetable. (get the chrome pieces out, it will become a borring model)
While I may seem harsh, I have to admit one thing: it's perfect for children. It has a small size, doors and opening roof, making it easy to put somebody in. The construction is easy and it has shiny pieces. The back doesn't feature any attach though: you'd have to design your own way to attach cargo to the back.

Final:
Design: 3/5. Shiny pieces avoid it to be too bland. Other than that boring.
Playability: 3/5. Nice play possibilities, especially for children. Gets boring fast in itself though, modifications have to be made to make it interesting. (cargo!)
Pieces: 4/5. Doors, Roof, chrome.
Price: 3/5. You get a truck for a low price, but spending the same for the new repair truck is a lot more interesting.

Okay model, but bland. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-06T08:57:46.74Z","LEGO Town (Vehicles) - LEGO Truck Review","This set is a great small set to have - even if it almost doesn't have any play features. The build is fun and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on. This truck is very easy to maneuver as well. The ceiling on the top and the doors on each side are able to open and the driver fits in this vehicle very easily, too. This set is a nice set to add to any LEGO city for sure and it's also great for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms as well.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
