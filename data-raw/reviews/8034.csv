<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Packaging is both a pro and a con.&nbsp; Con: kind of a pain to open.&nbsp; Pro: not being easy to open makes it sturdy.&nbsp; The&nbsp;hard cardboard backing makes it great for collectors to store and the bubble encased figures is excellent for displaying.&nbsp; You can feel the magnets pull through the packaging if you place it against a metal surface, however it is not strong enough to hold the 3 figs in the package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who you get:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dyna-Mite - the main reason I was attracted to this set not having had her before.&nbsp; She has sweet shades, a detailed leather/spy print on *both* sides, a sleek gold mauser lookin gun and (of course) dynamite.&nbsp; Her red hair is a nice design that you don't see too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pirate Girl - The only one of these I already had, but she usually came with bigger or hard to find sets.&nbsp; She, too has print on both sides, a lovely eye-patch and&nbsp;comes with her sword and flint-lock pistol.&nbsp; She has my favourite design for girl-hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pink-Heart Girl - Comes with a green&nbsp;apple and would make a great resident for the apple tree-house. She has a pink vest with heart necklace (very nice detail) and also has print on both sides, however the reverse is merely a couple of cloth creases.&nbsp; Her hair is quite interesting:&nbsp; I originally thought it a shorter bob-cut, but after opening her up I was quite surprised to see a long&nbsp; ponytail hanging down in the back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is 5/5 overall (the 1 for building experience solely because they all came pre-built) and I highly HIGHLY recommend getting this for the not-so-easy to find 3 cool female figures with sweet accessories...especially since they are on sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;A great addition to any Lego Ville!</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5
