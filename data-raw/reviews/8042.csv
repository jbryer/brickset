The build is fun, and the minifigure is really neat. Not to mention that the end result is fantastic too. I guess the only problem I can see is that there isn't a whole lot of playability- there is only one car, which means that you won't exactly be able to have a huge race (maybe a race against time?) unless you have more race cars handy. But overall, this set puts a smile on my face, and I hope it does on your's too.",FALSE,4,4,4,3,5
