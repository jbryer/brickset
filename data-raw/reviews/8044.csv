"KJM72","2010-07-12T19:22:16.59Z","Possibly the Best Architecture Set Ever","I was happy to find the White House in a LEGO Store. Seeing it, I nabbed the last one off the shelf quickly. It was nice to see that it was being sold for $49.99 USD for 560 pieces, finally making the Architecture sets seem fairly priced.<div><br></div><h4>The Box</h4><div><br></div><div>While some see the box as unimportant, I think it's safe to say that the Architecture sets have some of the best boxes of any LEGO set around. Not only do they have a clean, elegant appearance, but they are very sturdy. They are easy to open, to. All you have to do is barely cut one piece of tape to open the box. LEGO clearly paid attention to the Architecture series, as they all reveal the words ""Enjoy you building experience"" when you open the flap on the box. The back of the box has some fascinating info about the architect and the building.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Instructions</h4><div><br></div><div>Again, it's important to note that the instructions are as well thought-out as the box. The sturdy booklet, like the other sets in the theme, has the history of the building and architect in the first few pages, along with a page of building facts. It was also refreshing to see a fact and photo in the bottom right corner every few pages in the instructions. The back of the instruction booklet also has some brief paragraphs about Adam Reed Tucker (the set designer)'s &nbsp;approach with designing both the model and the Architecture series as a whole.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div><br></div><div>The White House has a fairly entertaining build. Some parts are repetitive (such as one step which requires the builder to connect 1x1 plates, bricks, and jumper plates 16 times), but it's quite cool to see the model come together. I was astounded to see the number of white jumper plates that came with the set. The white lightsaber blades should also prove to be useful.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Final Model</h4><div><br></div><div>The main reason I think this is the best Architecture model yet is it's very realistic appearance. It has some fantastic details, including the steps in the front, the outdoor chandelier, the portico, and the windows that are set-in. You have to see this model and be able to observe it to truly enjoy it. I find the model to be quite strong. The printed plate that says ""The White House"" is a plus.</div><div><br></div><h4>Pros:</h4><div><br></div><div><ul><li>Great box</li><li>Instruction manual has awesome information</li><li>Sturdy model</li><li>Mostly entertaining build</li><li>Details, details, details</li><li>Good part assortment</li><li>Fair price</li></ul><div><br></div><h4>Cons:</h4><div><br></div><ul><li>Some repetition in construction results in tedium</li><li>You can't really ""play"" with it. Made to display.</li></ul><div><br></div><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><div><br></div><div>If you are a fan of the Architecture series, or are fond of Washington, DC, then this model should be very pleasing. The piece count seemed to justify a $50 price tag for me as I held the box in my hands, but the price shouldn't have to be justified. The White House is a truly phenomenal set. I very highly recommend it for the details it has. The Architecture series seems to be made for AFOLs, or those able to appreciate the models despite not having actual ""playability.""</div><div><br></div><div>I gave the model a ""4"" on the playability scale because it isn't supposed to be played with, but it displays well like it is supposed to.</div><div><br></div><div>Grab this set now, you won't regret it!</div><ul><li><br></li></ul></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"i_am_in_high_school","2010-10-02T15:10:00.173Z","Good model, good build, but where's the president?","<p>this model might be my favorite architecture model. following the line of landmarks, the white house was a very nice addition. I have a few pros and cons though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: 
<li>very detailed 
<li>lots of white and black slopes to add to your lego collection 
<li>comes with balcony pieces ( my favorite pieces of the model ) 
<li>the little trees are a good detail</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cons: 
<li>nothing to play with, for display only 
<li>flag on top is white while it should have been red 
<li>no president included which would have been really cool</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;and also if i could have&nbsp;added 1 thing to this model, I would have added &nbsp;special president pieces to make the president black/white so the model could be updated every election. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;so overall this is a very nice set. I would highly suggest you go out and buy one.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,2,3
"richselby","2011-11-10T16:35:52.29Z","Nice Set, Shame About The Blurb","<p>This was my first set from the Architecture line. Unlike the smaller ones, it seemed to offer a decent amount of pieces to build with. And unlike the larger ones, it wasn't going to blow a crater in my bank account. It's still expensive, but not quite as expensive as, say, Falling Water.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Who would have expected to see droid arms and light sabre blades in this most non-Star Wars-like set imaginable? The droid arms hold the light sabre blades in place around the rear curved portico, where they work as micro-scale columns.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Otherwise, lots of 1x1 plates, white jumper plates and black 1x1 bricks with a hole in. I've got to admit, this confused me at first. Why didn't they use regular 1x1 bricks, especially as there were absolutely no Technic pins to insert?</div><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#ad1808""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;""><b><br></b></span></font></div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I learnt something new about the 1x1 brick with a hole in. The stud on top is hollow, meaning a second jumper plate can sit on top and reverse the indent. That's how the windows are recessed. Anyone building this set will remember that forever, as you get to repeat it so often, a bit like doing lines at school.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><br></h4><div>The build took about two hours, split over several sessions, which was longer than I expected. No numbered bags either, you have to do your own sorting.</div><div><br></div><h4>The completed model</h4><p>Smart. Swanky. Very displayable.</p><p></p><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; ""><br class=""Apple-interchange-newline"">Minifigures</span></div><p>A missed opportunity to supply a Barack Obama minifigure. Have to DIY, perhaps with a head from the old basket ball range.</p><p><br></p><h4 style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial; "">Box/Instructions</h4><p>Just one thing lets this set down, and that is the 6 pages of context-setting articles at the start of the instruction booklet about architect James Hoban and the history of the White House. I was looking forward to learning something about the building, and so opened it up to read on the train to work. Thanks to the smart black booklet format, I didn't get that slight sense of embarrassment I usually get when perusing Lego instructions on public transport. But don't judge a book by its cover.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The copy reads like a hurried homework assignment from a student who doesn't really understand or care for the subject. I wouldn't be surprised to discover chunks of it were lifted wholesale from Wikipedia. To make matters worse, the typesetting and copy editing is appalling. One line reads ""President Washington red him a year after he was hired"", instead of ""fired him"". And every time Thomas Jefferson is mentioned in the text, it is spaced ""Jeff erson"", even mid-line. &nbsp;Some lines are are so condensed the letters are printed over each other, whereas other lines are spaced so generously you could do a moon jump between words.</p><p><br></p><p>The copy works best when next to the build instructions, e.g. a &nbsp;about a paragraph about the portico at the point where you are building the portico.</p><p><br></p><p>Lego instructions are usually devoid of words, so I guess people who can write decent English are far and few between in Billund. So next time, TLG, please hire a copy writer and editor. Especially when you want to make a premium, i.e. very expensive, product aimed at non-traditional Lego customers. Otherwise, you'll just look foolish.</p><p><br></p><p></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Copy-moan aside, I enjoyed building this. I even plan to save for Falling Water. I just really hope I won't cringe when I read the booklet.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,1,4

I build most sets under 500 pieces as a ""puzzle build"", without using the instructions.</p><p><strong>Initial impressions:</strong> One of the most attractive models in the Architecture line, I was excited when I received this as a gift.&nbsp; At 560 pieces, I was optimistic but unsure if I could complete this as a puzzle build since there is a lot of repetition in the design.</p><p><strong>Building experience:</strong> I enjoyed this build from the start.&nbsp; I liked the 1/2 stud offsets used throughout the exterior, and reverse-engineered them quickly.&nbsp; This allowed me to reduce the # of available pieces to a more reasonable number in finishing the cupola, roof and other details which are hard to see in the photos.&nbsp; I was able to complete the model nearly perfectly without using the instructions which was very satisfying!</p><p><strong>Finished Model:</strong> This is a truly great model with nice details.&nbsp; It doesn't hurt that the White House is an attractive building in real life, and the scale of the model was sufficient to really capture those details well.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> 9/10 on a 10-point scale.&nbsp; This is my favorite in the whole Architecture series.&nbsp; Great build, great model.&nbsp; Lego at it's finest.</p><p><em><strong>As a puzzle build, this model took around 4 hours to complete.&nbsp; </strong>(I did a little at a time over many days.)</em></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,5
"Dude45","2017-01-06T08:25:59.58Z","A decent rendition of the White House but with poor texts","<p>This is a pretty straightforward build of the White House in Washington, D.C; one of the bigger sets in the Architecture range. Aside from the window sections being a bit repetitive the build is very enjoyable. I like how the windows have been depressed to produce some nice looking shadows. I also think the front with the eight pillars and triangular top shape has been nicely captured. The small trees are a nice touch.</p>

<p>The texts in the instruction booklet seem like disorderly copied Internet content with little cohesion. How could that crap make it into production? I expect top quality texts when paying a hefty premium for&nbsp;Architecture sets.</p>

<p>An annoying aspect of the model is the big black roof. It takes over the visual impression of the building when in fact the roof is not as elevated and barely seen at all. All the windows should have been made smaller, by one plate in height. I also wish a U.S. flag tile could have been created for this set. &nbsp;Finally the portico facing the garden looks strange primarily because the too thin pillars cannot be put in the right places.</p>

<p>Granted, the small scale of the model and the constraints of LEGO building forces a designer to make simplifications. For instance the number of windows is wrong on the sides and within the portico. Despite all problems,&nbsp;this is a decent set that will fit nicely into your Architecture set collection.</p>

"Zeke_Nitron","2018-08-26T20:46:07.943Z","Presidential Plastic Display Piece","<p>My grandparents bought me this set two or three years ago, let me just say building it is the worst part. The walls are very frail while building and the shrubs (?) fall off if you take it off the shelf for dusting. However, the display&nbsp;part of it is absolutely&nbsp;awesome. Greatly&nbsp;designed, smart choices with pieces and the usual Architecture&nbsp;polish makes this a great set. If there is room on your shelf then, by all means, buy it.</p>

Its not hard for you to translate something lke the white house into a LEGO build, but they do it very well. It is a great display piece to have and it looks really good on a shelf. It just looks very clean, organized, and it pleases the eye to look at it. I would higly recommend this to anyone who liked the White House of likes history.</p>
