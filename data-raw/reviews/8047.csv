"absolutelylez","2010-07-23T17:43:39.677Z","A good all rounder","This is a free promotional set. <br><br>The pros:<br>- a neatly designed lamp with many uses<br>- two ""fire"" pieces, with many uses<br>- a sausage, everyone needs a sausage,<br>- and other accessories (the bench).<br><br>- The new Woody figure. The figure has extra long legs, which are very interesting and completely change the proportion of any other minifigure they're put onto! Woody's arms are also longer, and result in a very funny looking minifigure if short legs are attached.<br><br>There is printing on both sides of woody, with the cowhide pattern and the pull ring printed on.<br><br>The cons:<br>The major disappointment is that his hat does not come off from his head; think of the wasted play opportunities.<br><br><br>Obviously, the pros outweigh the cons!<br>",TRUE,3,5,4,5,5
"United_Bricks","2011-02-16T11:51:06.817Z","HOTDOG","This set was released by daily mirror or record. This set has some good pieces in it. It comes with one minifigure, which is woody from toy story.<br><br><h4>THE MINIFIGURE</h4><p>Woody is the only minifig in this set. Woody's head is molded with plastic, his hat can not come off. His face has some good detail on it, his torso is double sided with printing on both sides. His arms are much longer than normal minifigs. He has flesh colored skin, finally his legs are longer to, he has some detail on his pants like a belt and some other things. He is an interesting minifigure. OVERALL 4/5</p><p><br></p><h4>ACCESSORY'S</h4><p>The log seat is pretty basic but its OK, it would be good if you were building a forest scene. The lamp is cool, again it would be good for a forest. The fire has a nice piece but they could of designed the base a bit better, it should have been like the camp fire in one of the Indiana jones sets (7624). It comes with a silver pan which I thought that it was a good piece which you could use in a cafe or something. It comes with a hotdog my favorite piece in the whole set. At the time I didn't have one, but now I have a couple. The hotdog is a good design, the hotdog is red. Finally the snake, the snake is green. I thought it was good that lego gave a green snake instead of those boring red snakes. OVERALL 3/5<br></p><p><br></p><h4>OVERALL</h4><p>Their was some good pieces in the set and some bad. I would give it a 7/10</p><p>(please read my other reviews Legoboy12345678)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,5
