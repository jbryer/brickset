"Zuma","2010-10-08T16:08:48.167Z","Seasonal delight","<p>If you got the winter toy shop last year and enjoyed that, then this set is a must buy to go with it! </p>
<p>The stickers were loose inside the box, but luckily they were not creased, and the box itself is a more reasonable size, no masses of empty space.</p>
<p>7 minifigs and the legs sticking out of the snow pile make for a great set to play with and create different poses. It has a good build style with a new caramel colour and a minifig scale camera. The inside of the bakery is well designed and realistic. The first floor however does not have much detail inside it. The roof is a better and more secure fit than that of the winter toy shop and as it is a different style it gives it some uniqueness. </p>
<p>If you wanted to add to it, maybe some piles of snow or more skating space, or cakes in the bakery. </p>
<p>Overall, it costs more than the winter toy shop and has less pieces, but it is a great design and a great set for displaying and playing, so the cost should not put you off. If you don't like stickers, there are only three, and all on single bricks. I have given it a five for everything as there are enough things in this set for Lego fans of all ages to enjoy. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"sudorum","2010-12-26T17:25:47.993Z","A 2nd Holiday Special ","Another good holiday set by lego. It fits well with the toy shop and features new components. This seasonal set includes a stand for selling christmas trees, as well as a wagon to transport them. The ice rink is a nice addition too, but it's a little small. The bakery is the best part. The interior includes a tiled floor and a cash register that has pastries displayed beneath it. In the middle of the bakery is an oven and a crate containing two loaves of bread. The left side of the store has a window display of cakes which lights up when the light brick is shined upon it. Definitely buy this set if you already have the toy shop. And if you don't, buy this set anyway. It'll be worth it, especially because of the low price.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,5,3,5

"Sabrejimmy","2010-12-29T11:11:14.417Z","Nice set, but could have been better","&nbsp;&nbsp; I had high expectations for this set. After purchasing the Toy Shop back in October, I was anticipating an equal exciting build with the Village Bakery. However, after getting it for Christmas, I was disappointed with the overall experience of this set.<br>1. The Bakery Building<br>As I was building the Village Bakery, several things caught my attention. First, it seemed like there was less detail then the Toy Shop. The inside of the Bakery is relatively bare. Aside from the cupcake stand and the bread oven, the interior is practically bare of any other significant details. One of the awesome features I liked about the Toy Shop was the amount of detail inside the shop. I loved the toy tinker's workbench, the clock on the ceiling beam, the frog, and ingenious toys in the window. Where were these small details in the Village Bakery? Sure, the cupcakes looked nice. But that's about it. The bread pieces and the oven are also nice details, but the box of bread is stuck in the middle of the set. There's absolutely no way to remove the bread from the box without tearing off the roof or shaking the whole building. That's why I keep the bread in the oven. It makes me wonder why they decided to put that bread box in a hallway to begin with. How can the people move around the store? Thankfully, the bakery includes the sparkling light brick, which adds a warm glow of light to the interior. The outside street lamp is a wonderful addition to the bakery part of the set.<br>2. The Ice Skating Rink<br>Personally, the ice skating rink area seems sloppy and ""rickety."" The area is held together with only a few plate pieces, and the light poles are wobbly and unstable. Any time I move this part of the diorama I'm afraid the whole thing is going to fall apart. The strand of Christmas lights hangs so low that the minifig girl can't stand directly underneath them or her head will hit the lights. The set designers could have made the lights just a little higher. I'm also pretty disappointed with the bench in the skating rink area. It looks similar to the beautiful park bench in the toy shop, except this one is smaller and the legs are ugly. I'm not sure why the designers didn't use trans blue tiles for the skating rink itself. Perhaps it didn't look nice, or maybe it would cost more money to produce? I'm not sure, but I don't think this ice looks good with studs. The owl is a nice touch, although I can't imagine an owl sitting atop a pole at a skating rink. Something tells me they'd rather be in a tree. But hey, I guess I'm being too picky. The rope part is a very handy piece to have. I almost wish they would have scrapped the ice skating rink section, saved it for a later set, and made the price of this set a little cheaper. <br>3.The Christmas Tree Cart<br>The Christmas tree cart is probably one of my favorite parts of this set. The folding pieces on the side look great and the driver is very detailed with the axe and whip. I just wish they had used a brown piece for the horse instead of that weird black grooved brick. <br>4. The Christmas tree stand looks amazing. My only complaint is the sticker. The stickers were also a disappointment with this set. Instead of ""building"" a present like the one from the toy shop, this set requires the slapping of a sticker on a 2X2 brick. It seems lazy and isn't quite impressive. Altogether, there is a sticker on the Christmas tree stand, the present, and the bakery sign. <br>5. The Minifigs<br>The minifigs in this set are great. They're very detailed and the chosen heads have multiple expressions. The set includes a rare coat hood piece. My only complaint is that the clothes don't match as well as the toy shop set. <br>Overall, this set is a nice addition to the seasonal Christmas village, but it doesn't have the same details and qualities as the Village Toy Shop. Having said that, it's a nice set in it's own right. Don't get me wrong, this set is pretty impressive. It just had the potential to be a little better. Put together with Village Toy Shop, the Bakery set looks great, and I can't wait to see what the Lego company has in store for the next Christmas season!<br><br>Pros:<br>Overall set fits nicely with the Village Toy Shop<br>Rare Baget Bread piece<br>Detailed Oven<br>Detailed tile flooring <br>Light Brick<br>Detailed streetlamp<br><br>Cons: <br>Ice Skating Rink is ""rickety"" <br>Poles on Ice Skating Rink area are unstable<br>Strand of Christmas lights seems too low on the skating rink<br>Bench on Ice Skating Rink looks incomplete <br>Stickers <br>Interior of the bakery is not very detailed<br>Bread box is situated in an awkward area of the shop<br>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3
"macmon","2011-02-22T11:03:42.69Z","Great Seasonal Set for every holiday building","I have noticed that LEGO releases every Christmas season a Winter model 
series for the past 2 years. My wife likes decorating every Christmas 
with my daughter and we were contemplating before on getting those 
miniature Christmas houses/sets that are made of ceramic But since LEGO 
have these models, I then decided that instead of those ceramics, we 
will just collect these model series. <br><br>It has the following advantages on my point of view.<br><br>1. It then let us get together every Christmas to decorate our house<br>2. It makes my little girl appreciate how to collect and take care of toys properly<br>3. It also makes her learn how to follow the instructions, at the same time be creative in her own way.<br>4.
 It makes us anticipate to assemble it every season and make us wait in 
anticipation on what will be the new model the next Christmas.<br><br>On to the review:<br>1.
 Minifigs: 5 adult minifigs (2 Female/3 Males(Baker, Horse carriage 
driver, Seller of pine trees) 2 kids and 1 lower half body stuck in 
snow.<br>I like this very much since it has various features especially 2 who has double sided faces which you can change.<br><br>2. Construction:<br>a.
  Christmas Tree stall: Simple but with colorful roof and has stickers 
for the banner of the stall. (Wish it was printed instead)<br><br>b. Ice skating area: This I like very much since you can pose the minifigs in different ways.Also the minifigs has ice skates :)<br><br>c.
 Bakery shop: This is the main construction, This occupied a lot of 
pages on the instruction but it is well worth it. What I like this very 
much again are due to the nice big windows with ""plastic"" glass, 
swinging door and also the window frames. Nice slanting roof for the 
second floor and open back for you to pose the minifigs particularly the
 oven itself. <br><br>The second floor has 1 functional room. The other 
one is not since the Brick LIGHT is placed there so that when you press 
on the button it will light up the 1st floor with the different 
pastries.<br><br>d. The Horse Carriage: Very nice since it has an animal
 included, Horse with functional and swinging sides and back of the 
carriage so you can pose it as if you are placing the pine trees.<br><br>e.
 Other items I feel are included that make this a must have. Pine trees 4
 pcs, the horse, shoe skates and a camera and apple  for the little 
boys, also the different kinds of bread included, plus an axe, shovel, 
hoe and horse whip. I almost forgot an Owl figure for the flag pole.<br><br>3.
 Sturdiness: The main bakery shop is quite sturdy except for the lamp 
post that get easily removed if you handle it as well as the brick light
 placed hanging on the second floor and the roof on top of it. It Easily
 falls off if you handle it hard. The Pine tree stall has a small base 
which I just wished it was  wider or larger to make it more stable.<br><br>4. Some minor gripes:<br>I
 have noted that my set has gray single studs instead of black for the 
lamp post, but looking at it now,  it gave some  contrast appearance 
instead of a dull black lamp post. Not sure if LEGO changed it without 
changing the instructions but I guess this made it unique for this model
 I got.<br><br>5. Modifiable: Well my daughter modified the hair, bodies
 of the minifigs. As in switching between the minifigs, I let her play 
with her imagination. :)<br>Since I bought a Santa Claue with Reindeer 
last Christmas (# 40010) I can place the whole piece on the top of the 
Bakery Roof as if Santa is either landing or flying away near the 
chimney. :) That is way cool for me. :)<br><br>So overall, I would say 5
 stars for me since I plan to collect this Winter series every year to 
add to the growing Christmas decors for our family. However, If you dont
 like the seasonality of this series, then get other models.<br><br>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
"AETerry","2012-01-07T15:33:12.48Z","Winter Village Bakery Review","<p>I picked this up in 2011 to begin my LEGO Christmas/Winter Village Collection.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The set comes in a standard cardboard box that all LEGO sets come in and like many of these specialty sets, there usually isn't a set name or theme, just the Item Number.</p><p>The instructions are also printed in booklet form with clear, easy to follow illustrated step by step instructions.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>At 687 pieces, the set is valued at $54.99 which is very good. Especially considering the horse figure, the uncommon tree pieces and rare owl that frequently can be a consideration to how a set is priced. Even the special lighted brick piece can cause set's price to go up.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are 7 &amp; 1/2 minifigures in all for this set. I say half as many who no doubt have pointed out before that you have the lower legs for someone that's fallen into a snowbank. There's a baker, shop patron, two skaters, boy with an apple, wagon driver and the worker for the Christmas Tree Stand.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model<br></h4>The build I think is fairly standard and somewhat innovative. The Baker's shop is very well detailed and the roof design is something I had come up with independently too on my own (with the hinge pieces), so I was pleasantly surprised to see it here.<br>You also have an ice rink nearby with a bench, trees, lights and couple of skaters.<br>Other minibuilds that are part of this set is a wagon pulled by a horse with a tree being carried. And a Christmas Tree Sales Stand.<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>For me, this makes a perfect start to hopefully getting the other Winter Village themed sets that are out and to come in future years. I know there's a ""Christmas Village 52"" or something like that that can be bought in stores every year. I know that line of collectibles is huge and there's lots of stuff to get for it. Personally I'd rather start on this for a Winter Village collection as it appeals to my love of LEGO. And at the price the sets seem to be going for and all the details, they seem they will be very much so worth it.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"DrFrankenstein","2015-03-02T19:58:45.823Z","Neat winter set","<p>The second Winter Village set introduces a lighter more-playful tone to the series that LEGO will develop even further in the sets to follow culminating with the Winter Village Market and Santa&#39;s Workshop sets. In comparison to the Bakery, the previous year&#39;s Toy Shop feel more traditional and darker - almost Dickenson-ian in style.</p>

<p>My favorite part of 10216 is the ice-skating ring with its playful design elements. I also like the horse carriage. The bakery itself if fine, but does not feel particularly remarkable, while the Christmas tree stand seems almost random. Still, the set works very well as part of the overall theme and contributes to the colorfulness of the winter town.</p>

<p>The build is quick and fun. The trans-blue base plates used in the ice skating ring are a nice touch as well as the polar owl. The light brick used in the main building makes it a little more interesting, but not a whole lot so.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure if this set would work well on its own,&nbsp; but as part of a winter village, it adds nicely to the setting. Certainly worth considering, if you are looking to develop your winter town.</p>

"Dread_Pirate","2012-11-09T02:12:08.677Z","Winter Village Bakery","OK I know this is an older set but I just bought it the other day and Mr. Postman delivered it to me today. Here are my thoughts.<br/><br/>The ice skating pond is my favorite part of the set. I love the details here with the lamp posts and the x-mas lights hanging between them. There is a little bench on the side of the pond for visitors to put their skates on. The skates are the only part I dont like. I dont know when Lego developed the skates used on the CMF Ice Skater but those would have been a much nicer touch than the 1x1 with spikes that were used in this set. Another great detail is the skater that went head first into the snow bank! Gotta love it.<br/><br/>The tree stand is pretty good but there is only one tree for the tree stand unless you remove trees from other locations. A couple more trees for the tree stand would have been a good touch here. <br/><br/>The horse and cart are part of the tree stand as you are supposed to put a tree in the bed of the cart. This cart is a good build and there is alot of playability here as the cart can be used for hay rides for the town's folk. <br/><br/>And now the bread and butter of this set (yes the pun is intended). The bakery itself is a pretty nice build. The buiding itself has 2 rooms, The first is the customer area with a bread basket and counter. The lower part of the counter has a couple clear bricks that make a showcase with some tastey treats inside. The other side of the building is where the baker does his work. There is an oven with hot coals inside that is just the right temp to bake bread. Also is a display table with some more goodies to show off in front of the big display window. The light brick illuminates the goody display and the display window in a yellowish light that resembles candle light.<br/><br/>The build itself is similar to other creator style sets and is not too hard for young builders but they should be skilled in building to attempt without adult help. The set has some good playability for young kids, and nice enough to be a great holiday display as well.",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
