""Luckily"" I couldn't find a piece and worked on other things like the roofs, cars and the top bridge. After that it wasn't as bad as building the second one cause its like refreshing an old memory. Like the title, this took 12hrs but this includes sorting for 4hrs.Sorting is a big thing here SORT.

I really like the like blue pieces cause they are new to me as well as some base plates!&nbsp; By the way, you get a lot of tan pieces :P Also because of the so many tan slopes, Lego kindly put them in separate bags..I'm hoping to see more of this in the near future.<br><br style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Playability:</span><br>I guess you can 'play' with it by opening the center and play with cars but..This really isn't a play set, its a model.

"MetroiD","2011-01-03T11:03:43.66Z","One word: Stunning","All four reviews that have been posted on Brickset so far are rather detailed, however I cannot help but notice that they've all found some little gripe they thought decreased the joy of the whole experience. Having just built the Tower Bridge a couple of days ago and also having had the opportunity to move it around the house quite a bit, I must say that I disagree with most of those and cannot see how this set could receive anything less than top marks.<br><br>First of all, the obvious matter of monotonous repetition throughout the build: excuse me for saying that, but if by looking at this model anyone even thought that the building experience would be thrilling and extremely diverse, I'd suggest they look at other LEGO sets first, before considering buying this one. The actual Tower Bridge consists of two identical towers and a bridge spanning across the Thames between them. In other words, at least two elements that are (almost) a perfect reflection of each other. Not to mention the other architectural elements of the structures that, of course, would need to be built in the same manner 2, 4 or even 8 times. And that makes for a bit of a repetition - but does it make the building experience any worse? Not in my point of view - in fact, the element of building the same modules and then arranging them on top of the build lets you appreciate the beauty of it all coming together. I'd never even consider taking points away from the TLG designers for that and was actually rather pleased with the whole building process. It's definitely something that would be a joy both to LEGO experts and beginners - so you should definitely consider getting your family involved here!<br><br>As to displaying and moving this beauty around - well, it is indeed a large model, but then again, it's also microscale and semi-modular. So I'd just qualify it as longish, but that does not necessarily imply that the model requires too much space. In other words, it would fit perfectly in a longer niche, on a shelf or over the fireplace. As to carrying it around - it couldn't be any easier really, just grab the whole thing by the arches of the towers et voila. Sturdy like I would have expected - the weight distribution is great, simply because the TLG designers got the proportions spot on and did some fine work on implementing a simple yet very nicely working modular structure. Sure, the ropes tend to disconnect rather easily, but then again this is a display model, not a swoosh-tastic spaceship.<br><br>In terms of bricks included, well I'd never even have considered buying this as a parts pack. That said, I was still thrilled to see how many nice pieces you get just for the 4 microscale vehicles that come with the model. Trans-scale 2x1 plates galore - and I love those, although now that I've placed the micro doubledecker on the bridge I can't quite bring myself around to pulling it apart and using those trans-clears for something else... To be honest, I don't think I ever will. The microscale Routemaster and London cab are simply beautiful and bring the whole set to life.<br><br>So, all in all, yes, you do have to do quite a bit of sorting before you start with the actual building. And yes, it would probably be best if you had a friend to build this together with, because that makes the whole experience so much more enjoyable (as is the case with most of these big Exclusive sets). And sure, there are no Power Functions for the bridge mechanism or any other similar fancy stuff. But in the end, this set is worth every last cent - and would most probably be one of the crown jewels in anyone's LEGO collection.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Dodge","2010-11-24T00:25:08.3Z","A crown jewel to be sure!","<p>This is&nbsp;a <strong><em>GREAT</em></strong> set!</p>
<p>As the other people who have reviewed it thus far have stated, sorting <em>needs</em> to be done.&nbsp; At first I was surprised that the bags weren't numbered to coinside with the booklets as they have been doing nowadays, but the wealth of pieces needed for each step makes that a little bit tough.&nbsp; <em>I was glad that I emptied out my tupperware bin to assist in the sort.</em></p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have people helping me out to build this, so we took on both towers at once.&nbsp; The other aspects fell into place easily, so the entire build time was only around 4 hours.</p>
<p>I would HIGHLY recommend this set as a focal piece in any collection.&nbsp; If you're looking to get it for the pieces, then don't build it.&nbsp; Once you put in the effort to do so, you'll never take it apart.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,5
"EdPork","2010-12-29T11:09:42.987Z","Awesome Replica of an Iconic Bridge","<p>I have seen the real Tower Bridge many times and often took for granted living in London but when Lego released this set I took a whole new look at the details of the real Tower Bridge to compare with this set.....and to be honest....it is awesome in the details LEGO have reproduced with this set. Granted the centre span is not as wide as the real bridge but I assume this is because of the construction constraints with building a wider centre span.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Typical LEGO box with mixed bags of bricks etc</p><p>Instructions are in 3 books, very simple to follow.<br></p><p></p><h4>Parts</h4>With over 3400 parts sorting prior to build is a must, it takes some time but is essential during the build<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>None included but the small scale vehicles (London Red Bus, London Black Taxi, Yellow Dump Truck and Small Green Car) are an excellent feature<br>
<h4>The build</h4>The build commences with a simple construction of the centre bridge road section then you get into the construction of the two main towers....they are identical so it is best to build them in parallel and they take some time with many 4x and 8x steps to create the vertical bricks and details....plenty of windows too, which is great! You then connect the two towers to the centre section via the TECHNICS connectors located in the tower base<br><br>The penultimate part is the construction of the two side road sections and the suspension chains.....then you connect these to the two towers to complete the build of the bridge.<br><br>Finally, you build the 4 vehicles to place on your completed bridge.<br><br>Total Construction Time: 12 hours<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4>An excellent replication of such an iconic London Landmark....lets hope LEGO do more of the same type of model in the future.<br>

"hartho","2011-02-14T19:51:44.757Z","Brick gold","<p>What can you say about this set. Words can&#39;t almost express the beauty and the feeling you have whilst building it. This is one of the best sets Lego ever has issued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is HUGE. It really weighs almost 5kg all together. Pictures on the box are detailed and are taken from angles that makes you want to posses this set. 3 Books come with the set, each of them over 50 steps to build. Instructions are very clear and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Parts</h4>

<p>There are a lot of tan colored parts. Especially the 1x1 slope bricks of which over 550 are included in the model. Also nice parts are:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>light blue colored plates</li>
	<li>many small and larger windows</li>
	<li>the cones on top of the towers</li>
	<li>the shields with the weapon printed on it</li>
	<li>loads of fences small and tall</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Mini vehicles</h4>

<p>This category usually is called mini figures, however I took the editorial freedom to change the subject into mini vehicles, since that is what comes along with the bridge. 1 iconic double decker London bus, a London cab, a truck and a sports car. These vehicles do complete this model.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<div>It took me roughly 7 hours to complete the model. I video taped the build. I empty all bags on one big pile of Lego bricks. Man, that looked impressive. 4287 bricks (+ some additional as a gesture of generosity of the Lego company :))&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The build is a challenge, but not too much for the experienced Lego builder. Some steps do have boring repetition of building in them, but wanting to finish the model was paramount.&nbsp;</div>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<p>When the model is finished it cannot be easily taken apart. At least not as easy as Lego wants us to believe. The lower mid section of the bridge (part that can open) can be pulled away from the tower. However the model can still not be taken apart without braking it, since the bridge on top of the bridge cannot be simply pulled from the tower sections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This really is the only downside that I can think of.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>All in all the set you MUST have as a LEGO addict.</p>

The price seems really nice (not much more expensive than modular buildings). I was planning on buying it really soon, but got this for my 30th birthday instead :)</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Large and heavy box. 3 instructions books secured with a cardboard card.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>A great selection of bricks in that 4287 pieces. Lots of windows, lots of fences, some nice light grey slopes, lots of tan and white and a decent amount of light blue. 500+ of small 1x1 slopes is a bit excesive though :)</p>
<h4>Minicars</h4><p>Microscale vehicles look great. Iconic double decker and a black cab are a great match. The green sports car and yellow pick-up truck seem a bit more generic. But the cars are a really great touch on the finished model.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Took me about 12 hours. During the first 6 hours I managed to build the middle section, sort the bricks and build 3/4 of the first tower (a complete section of the instruction, which then tells you to repeat the process and build the 3/4 of the other tower). I kind of disliked the fact that you only get to build the 3/4 of the tower and then you are told to start over... you get really excited that you almost finished the tower but then you are not actually allowed to finish it... The next day I spent 6 more hours building the second tower, building the top middle section, fixing the mistakes I made earlier, finishing both towers and the ""lines sections"".&nbsp;</p><p>Once you built the body of both towers, building get a bit hard for a moment as you get to work on a large model putting small pieces on top of it. Only when you start to build the roof pieces, you can sit back and focus on smaller sections to build that you then attach to the main model.</p><p>The things that happen on top of the towers are weird - you get an unhealthy mix of 1x2 jumper tiles, 1x1 and 1x2 flat tiles and some tiles with slides. Although it is hard to notice on the completed build, this mix seems chaotic and unestetic, all because Lego does not make 1x1 tile with slide... Also puting together all those 500+ cheese pieces can get a bit tiresome. The walls with windows also seem a bit chaotic, often loose for a bit to long before they get secured and consisting of tons of small pieces.</p><p>I really liked the slope/roof sections, the mini-corner-towers and the lines sections which I find really awesome and really close to the real ones (with the red dot on a white circle). The rounded corner ""columns"" look really great (those 500+ 1x1 slopes were put to good use).</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I do not fully understand why the top-middle sections are built inside the tower walls. The connection to the walls is really weak and unsecure (the bridge broke while being transported on the back seat of my car) but it prevents the bridge from being&nbsp;disassembled easily. The bottom middle section and the lines sections disassemble, and the top middle sections are the only things that prevents disassebmling into 7 easy to reassemble sections. This sollutions has no pros, only cons.</p><p>Nevertheless the completed build looks absolutely awesome! Huge and detailed. When you compare it to the real Tower Bridge you will find tons of real-life details. The only thing that differs noticeably are the top-most side windows, which are pulled back to the center of the tower, while on the real Tower Bridge they are directly above the lower windows.</p><p>With the model being over a meter long, you really need a lot of free display space :)</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Awesome set! The largest you can get these days. Has a fair price and tons of usefull bricks.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,1,5

As I am 13 when I built this and there were a total of 4287 unsorted pieces it was a tough challenge! But after 2 days of building (and playing video games) this was finally complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build was a lot funnier when I was building with my friend because we built one tower each. There were also a lot of interesting building techniques that I hadn&#39;t encountered in a Lego set before. Building experience 4/5</p>

<p>The parts were pretty basic but the PPP is very low, so that&#39;s very good. You don&#39;t get any minifigures&nbsp;but the cars are&nbsp;very interesting. My favorite is the London bus. Parts 3/5</p>

<p>The playability is not huge but that is not the main thing about this building, it is more of a display piece. But it makes&nbsp;a very neat battle scene. I put in hulkbuster and ant man battling on top of it (yes I know they are both good guys but let&#39;s say Ultron took the Hulkbuster). Playability (and display) 4/5</p>

<p>The value for money is&nbsp;good,&nbsp;PPP is about a half SEK (5.6c) So this would also make a great parts pack. Value for money 5/5</p>
