"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-13T08:53:38Z","Could do better","This is a reasonable set to add to a small lego trainset layout, but it does have some limitations. The actual station itself is very small, being tall and thin with a small amount of footspace. Some of the figures are nice though. Makes for quite a rural station - would be nice to see something more urban.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"jd5775","2007-08-08T23:53:22.597Z","Nice, but I like the yellow","This is the best train station Lego has ever made.  I've always liked the yellow version better, but didn't buy it during it's time.  Sure enough the red one comes along and I ordered it ($73.00... Yellow one was $72.00 I think).  As for the station, it was one of Lego's better designed buildings with the real big train station feel i.e. the windows high above the doors.  The little cart is nice too and is fit to carry alot of baggage, and trust me there is alot of baggage in this set, and mail, and packages, and...  Anyway I like this set and you kind of have to because it's the only decent train station lego has thrown out so, don't settle for anything less.  I recommend that you buy the red set but if your rich, buy the yellow one because it has better people, cooler color, and with it you can show off how rich you are. :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-12-22T13:48:13.763Z","Perfect in Both Colors","This set was also in yellow, but this red station is pretty good too. You get alot of minifigures, baggage carriers, a small cafe, and the detail on the station is flawless. IF you have this set in red or yellow, they're both pretty good sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Nesquik","2009-06-22T06:17:00.03Z","Nice design, but slightly dated","While this is a nice looking model, I do feel it hasn't aged too well. One of the problems is it's rural feel which doesn't suit the freight sets too well, but also the use of older style window panes which give it less suburban look.

One important plus is though is the design of the platform, which is very stable and flat.

Station 7997 easily beats this as a more modern comparison, though do be aware the platform isn't as stable, and has less minifigures.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-29T09:35:54.06Z","LEGO Trains (9V) - Train Station Review","This set is a great set to have and one of the best railway stations LEGO ever made. For some reason LEGO also did a yellow version of this set. This model is a great build and it has some cool play features. We also get a few stickers to worry about. This railway station also comes with a vehicle which has some luggage on it and the trailers can be removed very easily. In the front of the building we get 3 chairs, two lamps, a mail box and a schedule. The doors and the windows behind the 3 chairs can be opened and the clock can sviwel as well.<br><br>The inside of the building has 3 chairs as well, a phone and a restaurant. On the top we also get an office where you can see a sviwel chair and a safe which can be opened. It's a really fun set and I also can't complain about the number of minifigs we get in this set as well. As I told you in the beginning: This is one of the best railway stations which LEGO ever made...<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"mablemyhre","2011-02-10T12:12:14.59Z","The Very Best Rail Station","<p>We bought this new so many years ago. The red color is rarer than the yellow.&nbsp; I like the red better. The design of this structure is wonderful with the many windows and the hip roof. The clock is cool.&nbsp;The luggage carts are great.&nbsp; You get lots of luggage.&nbsp; There is a great mailbox with letters.&nbsp; The assortment of minifigs are great.&nbsp; This building is the one that stands out on our layout.</p>
