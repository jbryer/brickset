"parchioso","2011-04-20T11:38:28.79Z","Another chance for you to have the Maersk ship","<p>It is really a great thing to see Lego re-issuing the Maersk ship, after building it, I think the size of the ship is not as big as I once thought, the design is quite straightforward, aside from the Maersk blue bricks, I think the dark red bricks that forms the base is very useful too, especially for building other ships such as aircraft carriers, I am not really after the Maersk Blue but just cannot deny that its rareness does mean a lot for any lego collectors.</p>
<p>The Cargo control room or control tower is also a key structure of the ship of course, the pair of boat windows make the ship more realistic, and there are good details at each floor such as stairs, lights and pillars. I also like the front which is built out of small bricks and not a special big part. </p>
<p><br/>The stickers are kept in a plastic bag, which is not usually done for stickers but perhaps a norm for models with that many stickers, the containers form an important part of the overall body, since you have stickers for both side, there are 60 gray and 28 white stickers, well, building the containers and applying stickers to it can be boring, but it is worth the effort, by looking at the finished work, I think this is a good investment of effort and money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 10152 but it is MISB and not opened, so I cannot make a comparison, but based on many info I got, the two are very similar and the difference is mainly on the stickers, in 10152 it was ""Maersk Sealand"" while in 10155 it is ""Maersk Line"" now. A few people also mentioned about brick quality, which I tend to believe but cannot make conclusions based on the suspected blemishes I observed as they can be subjective.</p>
<p><br/>I have posted pictures for the set at my blog: <a href=""http://brickand.me/2011/04/20/HavingThe10155MaerskShipFinally.aspx"">http://brickand.me/2011/04/20/HavingThe10155MaerskShipFinally.aspx</a> <br/></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
"jamal_lts","2011-04-24T20:23:24.56Z","What will we ever do without cargo ships?","Firstly, i have to mention that the box for this set is different from these/last few years box art and colors. Its the old lighter blue color and overall looks quite vintage. Perhaps because it was a reissue of an earlier set (10152)<br><br>Part count for the set is is around 990 pieces which you can roughly guess how big the model will be. BUT you will never expect the detailing to be superb. Roughly, the scale of the ship is a quarter the size of a tiny turbo car scaled to an actual car. It means u size down a Tiny Turbo car 4 times to bring it to scale to the cargo ship. I think they call this Micro Scale in some building books or guides.<br><br>There are no boring sections in the building process. No repetitions either except for the containers. You'll get 30 grey containers and 14 white containers. In fact you will actually have fun building it. Only 6 parts to complete a container and its not complicated at all. After 2 or 3 builds of it, your hands are doing it blind automatically while you are having a conversation about anything else with someone.<br><br>The only complicated or hardest section to build in this set will be the bridge areas. A lot of white pieces but nonetheless exciting in its detailing. You will be like ""Hey, didn't realize it could be use that way!""<br><br>The main colors used in the set are White, Maersk Light Blue, Reddish Brown (Wookie) , Dark Brown. All good colors to have in your arsenal of bricks.<br><br>Overall. No playability, definitely not mini fig scale. Its more of a display piece. Nonetheless a really great set to have especially if you are in the shipping / marine industry.<br><br><br><br>",TRUE,4,3,4,1,5
"murrayhenson","2012-03-03T09:15:02.4Z","Ship-shape and Bristol fashion","<p>With some Lego sets I am indifferent or unsure as to whether or not I really want to spend the money. &nbsp;With others and most certainly with this, 10155 Maersk, I knew instantly that I wanted it. &nbsp;I knew that I'd want to get it, get home, sit down, and build it. &nbsp;No interruptions, just build. &nbsp;Readers, I can rather gleefully tell you that so it was and it was thoroughly satisfying.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I'm not so concerned with the boxes, to be honest. &nbsp;I usually think Lego does a fairly good (if somewhat stylised)&nbsp;pictorial&nbsp;representation of what the finished product will look like. &nbsp;The instructions were, as always, simple, straight-forward, and easy to follow. &nbsp;I did note, upon opening the box and emptying its contents onto the table, an odd sheet showing a red ""X"" through a set of bricks/pieces depicting a window and ""glass"" ...and an ""="" sign to another, similar-yet-slightly-different, set of window and glass bricks/pieces. &nbsp;I did not know what to make of this but, later in the process when these pieces were called for I realised that at some point a substitution was being made.</p><p><br></p><p>I can also comment on the shipping box here since I ordered two of the same set, one for me and another for a friend in the US. &nbsp;The set was purchased via Amazon.de and shipped from Germany to my home in Poland. &nbsp;I was a little surprised to see that the cardboard shipping box was branded with the Lego trademark. &nbsp;The shipping box also looked a bit worse for wear; the Lego 10155 boxes inside being fairly unsubstantial did not provide a great deal of additional support or rigidity to the shipping box and as a result they were a bit squished.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_maersk_shipping_box_01_s1.jpg[/img]</p><p><br></p><p>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_maersk_shipping_box_02_s1.jpg[/img]</p><p></p><p><br></p><h4>Parts</h4><div>It seems as though most Lego&nbsp;aficionados want the ""Maersk blue"" bricks. &nbsp;It is a nice colour although not something I am overly concerned with. &nbsp;To be honest, I was more excited by the orange pieces for the lifeboats. &nbsp;Otherwise, I don't know that there are a lot of especially unique or interesting pieces here. &nbsp;For me, nothing too small or too fiddly.</div><div><br></div><div>There are a few pieces left over after the build. &nbsp;Oddly, the 1x1 flat piece in Maersk blue is the ONLY one of that kind in this set; they've given an extra part that there is apparently no use for in the set.</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_maersk_built_03_s1.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div>

<h4>The build</h4><p>All of it up until the containers was quite enjoyable. &nbsp;It was interesting and fun to see how the ship was built up. &nbsp;Nothing felt tedious or boring. &nbsp;The only confusing part was, as noted earlier, the window substitution. &nbsp;I spent roughly seven hours assembling the set, taking my time and enjoying the process.</p><p><br></p><p>The containers are a different story. &nbsp;Patience - and persistence - is a virtue. &nbsp;There are 44 of them and 88 accompanying stickers. &nbsp;Not to mention the sticker on top of the conning tower, the two stickers on each long side of the ship and the small Maersk star logo in front. &nbsp;I quickly found that it was easiest to peel off a shipping container sticker, gently squeeze the sides in the middle (to make it bow ever so slightly down the length of it) and then carefully apply. &nbsp;I think this turned out fine; the stickers look fairly consistently applied. Below is a random picture of two containers with stickers. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_maersk_built_02_s1.jpg[/img]</p><p><br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Let's just come right out and admit it. &nbsp;Once set 10155 is built it looks awesome. &nbsp;It's quite long and there's just enough detail and emphasis on certain bits (conning tower, anchor, the many shipping containers (a double-edged sword, that)) that it feels realistic while also being understandably stylised as anything will be when it goes through the Lego design process.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as playability goes ...this has virtually no moving parts. &nbsp;The anchor can move but winding up the string is a bit of a pain. &nbsp;The containers are stacked on platforms that can be easily lifted up and dropped back down again. &nbsp;Otherwise, this is to be looked at not played with. &nbsp;I should note that it is fairly easy to move the model around both during the build process (after perhaps a third of the way through it is rigid) and after completion. &nbsp;As long as you have a hand under the ship just forward of the conning tower, you can move it without noticeable sag or other issues.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no instrumentation or other things inside the tower. &nbsp;If there was, the ship would probably have to be twice or three times as large to keep everything vaguely in proportion. &nbsp;The model is 69 cm long, 9.5 cm wide, and about 20 cm in height (conning tower antenna). &nbsp;Proportionally, though, the ship seems right. &nbsp;Panamax ships are roughly 11:1 (length to width), the new Maersk E-class ships are 14.1:1, and the 10155 set works out to be 13.8:1.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_maersk_built_04_s1.jpg[/img]</p><p><br></p><p>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_maersk_built_05_s1.jpg[/img]</p><p><br></p><p>[img]http://elysion.pl/brad/lego_maersk_built_06_s1.jpg[/img]</p><p></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As there are no half or quarter stars, I've officially rated this 4/5 but it is closer to 4.5. Stickers that overlap bricks - and all do except for the small Maersk star in front - make it difficult to take the ship back apart. &nbsp;Everything else was superb.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,5
