One thing I dont like is that dunkan bulk has a black stringer gun which really discolers it truley... Dunkan bulk also has a jetpack which is cool. This set has 89 parts which is a really low number for this large box you get. This is set is also 24.99 which is about just right for two figures. This set is awsome so go get it!!",FALSE,5,4,4,5,4
"tdlace","2010-07-27T17:13:09.373Z","Pretty good, but a bit overpriced","<p>Dunkan Bulk &amp; Vapour is a pretty good set, but I have to admit, $25 for 89 pieces is a little bit too overpriced. I still think it's a great set, partially because it comes with two figures, an upgraded Dunkan (Duncan) Bulk, and Vapour, which only comes with this set.</p><h4>Pros and Cons For Dunkan Bulk</h4><ul><li><h4>Pros<br></h4></li><li>Removable hero core</li><li>Jet-pack with tube</li><li>Two guns</li><li><h4>Cons</h4></li><li>Hard to pose</li></ul><h4>Pros and Cons for Vapour</h4><ul><li><h4>Pros<br></h4></li><li>Easier to pose than Bulk</li><li>Recolored Rotor mask (Looks better on Vapour)</li><li>Bigger than Bulk</li><li>Two Thornax/Meteor blasters</li><li>Scope</li><li>Has spikes on his shoulders</li><li>Two claws</li><li><h4>Cons</h4></li><li>Arms are short and hard to pose</li><li>Leg armor is fused to his legs (That must hurt)</li></ul>In the end, it's a pretty good set, just a bit too expensive.<br>Hope this helps!<br><br><ul><li><br></li></ul><br>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,3

"KodakKid365","2010-11-16T23:49:40.26Z","Nice set","I would recommend this set, escpecialy since it is a limited edition. Bulk is cool with the the guns and jet pack. Yah, he just looks awesome! Vapour is also awesome. His left gun with the scope is super cool but the right one dosen't always stay in place.",FALSE,4,3,4,3,4
"terfsten","2011-11-17T12:36:42.637Z","Great 2-for-1 Set!","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this is a great set.

The hero, Dunkan Bulk, has a jet pack, a sonic weapon, and a metal sphere shooter. The villain, Vapour, has two vapour blasters and a huge sword blade. He has blue versions of corroder's claws down his shoulders, and a blue version of rotor's helmet. He also has really good armor pieces.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Play</span><br>This set is really good to play with. Both the hero and the villain have good flexibility and maneuverability. The only bad thing is that some of the pieces crack easily because the get too thin in places.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall</span><br>This is a really good set overall. Not only do you get a special Dunkan Bulk, you also get the limited edition Vapour. This set has really good parts, especially for MOCs. You should get this set.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Kuurk9999","2017-02-25T22:31:11.617Z","My favorite 2010 HF Villain!","<p>I&#39;m only going to review just&nbsp;Vapor himself&nbsp;because i don&#39;t really care about Dunkan Bulk that much</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, what is there to say about Vapor? He is the&nbsp;rarest and most obscurest&nbsp;HF villain in existence and he&#39;s nowadays&nbsp;really hard to find&nbsp;for&nbsp;a decent price. For some reason i&nbsp;got lucky at getting this particular&nbsp;villain when i did,&nbsp;and now, i&#39;m going to review him here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Vapor&#39;s mask, while not exclusive to him (the other time it was used was in Rotor), is pretty cool. it reminds me of a gas mask and i really like it. i think it fits him more than Rotor.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>the only other new&nbsp;parts to him are&nbsp;two of the Corroder parts in blue.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>He is the only HF villain to have a trans blue Glatorian head, which just surprises me as to why they didn&#39;t use the blue head more.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, if you ever attempt to&nbsp;find this villain, try to get him at a decent price.</p>
