"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-09T00:00:00Z","","This is probably my second favourite of the RoboForce series, about equal with the Robo Master (2154) - although it'd really be more accurate to say I don't DISlike it as much as I do the Robo Stalker (2153). The construction is a bit more sound, and it gives a much better visual impression, the shoulder pad things are a bit big, but they work. Quite what the rocket/ice saw arm is I don't know, but hey. The walking mechanism, well, it's been done before, and the legs seem a bit short. It doesn't seem immediately obvious to me that the head's a detachable ship, and I don't like that you have to bend the levers or pop them half out of the bases for the pilot to hold them. Still, gotta love those trans orange helmets...",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-10T06:35:37Z","i &lt;3 transparent orange","Wow, this set sucks. Seriously, when exploriens started fizzling out, i was waiting for an amazing new faction to come out. BOY, was roboforce a slap in the face! On to the review!

The good:
-It was a good source of transparent orange pieces. in fact the only reason why i bought it was to beef up my ice planet creations. this was back before every set had orange.
-as implausable as the orange helmet is, it actually looks nice... on an ice planet fig.
-fully functional walking and arms.
-a good variety of normal and specialized parts

The bad:
-Pretty shakey
-Roboforce as a subtheme seems halfway thought out. Sets have a &quot;random out the bucket&quot; color scheme instead of attractive ones. are there two factions of roboforce or one?
-head keeps falling off
-needed redesign. unlike the robo-raptor, it doesnt look like anything. its like the designers couldnt decide on something abstract, something classical-mechalike, or something antrhopomorphic.
-big belly from the mailbox

The ugly:
-just look at it! it IS ugly

I'd recommend buying it for the parts but there really isnt much to it. Save your cash and get a spyrius robot instead

If there were any sets that came after this with a good color scheme and design then I must be crazy. Lego truely outdid themselves when designing this series.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Aaronlego","2006-07-03T11:33:51Z","Pretty Nice","This set is a nice robot. I really liked the minifig, and the little head thing that was like a space scooter. The legs were nice also. This is probably my second favorite roboforce set. My first favorite is the Robo Raptor. Overall, this set gets an 8.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-08-03T12:53:17.88Z","5/5 best of the roboforce","this set is by far the best roboforce set.  I don't the like the walking mechanism that much, but i can live with a little mistake like that.  The set itself is pretty cool and the open cockpit/fighter design is just awesome.  THe color scheme works well with this set.  THe figure is cool too with the trans. orange helmet.  Overall not really any flaws.  Endless playability.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2009-02-01T12:13:59.497Z","First RoboForce","This is my first RoboForce set (I got it the same way I got my first explorian set) and I have to say it's quite nice.

Pro's:
*Cool astronaught minifig
