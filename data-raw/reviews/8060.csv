<p>The gameplay is remarkeably good, the levels original, and cutscenes funny. The&nbsp;differentiating between&nbsp;lessons and levels is a good idea, and having Hogwarts and Diagon Alley as free play areas was innovative. I thought that the controls were unecessarily complicated to begin with, but easy once you got used to them. The character customisation is also unecessarily complicated, but otherwise it's a very good game, until the third year...</p>
<p>The main problem is on the last level of The Prisoner of Azkaban. You are supposed to zap two statues, which sneeze and melt a door down. Unfortunately, the programmers did a very poor job, and the game always freezes and shows a 'fatal error' screen at this point. The only solution for this is the either a) leave a character at the beginning and miraculously switch between the two, or b) to go into the program files and change the pcconfig file.

<p>If possible, don't buy it for PC, buy it for Wii, or Playstation etc, because it's worth the money, especially if you can get it cheaper.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4
"deadtree103","2010-10-02T17:32:15.48Z","An almost perfect game!","<p>Well, I was REALLY excited for this before I got it, and I thought it was the best Lego game ever fr the first three quaters or so of it, unfortunately at that point things started getting annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gameplay is BRILLIANT, and it's actually possible to get 100%(Something I couldn't do in, for example, LSW: TCS)it also fixes one of my major nitpicks with the earlier Lego games: You ALWAYS had to stay with the other player!(Yes I know it was like that in LIJ2, but I don't have that one, might get it sometime though)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The so-called ""Building experience"" inside the game is interesting, and making your own levels is fun(I've only dabbled in it though)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Value for money is AMAZING, considering that you get a completely massive game for just thirty dollars, and the other platforms for this are probably also worth it, even with their raised prices(More on the differentiation later).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing, though: GLITCHES.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glitches, glitches, glitches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only Con of this game is those funny little things, there is one in particular that aggravated me and prevented me from progressing for quite a while:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sneezing statue glitch on the last level of POA, to fix it you had to mess with the computer's settings, and it prevented you from progressing completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with the glitches, this game is still very much worth it, although I would advise getting it for a different system, as the glitches are presumably lessened on the ther platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These glitches are understandable, though, seeing as this is the biggest Lego game yet.</p>
