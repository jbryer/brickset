(Excluding Star Wars the complete saga) After playing just a couple minutes of this game, I realized the detail to the actual movies. There are so many things to do, and it follows the story pretty well, and even has the whole soundtrack. After watching the 1rst moviw that night and playing it later, I was amazed by every detail, shop, character, and spell that was included in the movie. The gameplay is fairly easy with a whole bunch of stuff to blow up, and if you get stuck on something it is allways fun to levitate the innocent students or use a spell on them. There are some difficult puzzles though and are fun but long to figure out. My favorite part arethe spells, shops in Diagon Alley inable you to buy new spells and upgrade your spell wheel untill it is the strongest. Overall it is a very great game and was worth every cent.</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,5
