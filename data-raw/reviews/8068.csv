I always thought this was the coolest minifig ever, I found myself bidding on this minifig even when I was in my dark ages. Now the 2x4 tile, I can see it going for $50.00 on bricklink. Oh I also have a secret, if you are going to order the battle of endor, and Tantive IV or something in that price range, order them seperatley so shipping is free on both and you get two of these.</p>

<p>The Brickset photo tells you all you need to know about this mini-fig but I'll break it down...</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard 2x4 Magnet base.</li>
<li>White classic Spaceman suit</li>
<li>White removable helmet.</li>
<li>White removable oxygen tanks.</li>
<li>Front graphic, Classic Space logo with metallic gold paint for the planet.</li>
<li>Printed black&nbsp;tile (which you attach to front of Magnet base) with star pattern, LEGO logo, Classic Space logo (again with metallic gold paint for planet)&nbsp;and graphics which read, ""...in space since 1978"".</li>
<li>Excellent packaging/baggie.</li></ul>
<p>Obviously this'll appeal to collector's and lover of any and all mini-figs (it does look great on it's base). And of course fans and compleatists of the Classic Space line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only con, is that you have to spend $75.00us to get this little beauty (not sure of the deal in other countries. Heard different reports). Also, I believe the helmet is not the classic Space helmet original but the newer version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd say, if you're NOT gonna' do a $75 + purchase anytime soon, you can always check eBay to see if this shows up at a decent price. Haven't heard yet if this'll be a limited edition/short run or not but if you do get one, I'd hold onto it. It's a real nice looking mini-fig and great base. Wish more figs would have printed tiled bases for display. LEGO, get on that asap...;)</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5

The image is quite enough for me to talk about this item. <br><br>What I like about this item is that, it is a little bit humorous. The space icon on the minifigs torso is typical. The color choice is good for an ""astronaut"".<br><br>This may be a promotion item but it is not really designed to be way it should be. As most of you may know, the helmet was completely different at those times. This helmet is the newer helmet on which you can attach a glass. Actually, when this series were out, the helmets only had the small holes on both sides of the head. The lines for the glass to 'sit' were not on the helmet. <br><br>This may be a very small detail, but if you are creating an iconic item like this, you should be careful about these kinds of details. For me, this is just a 'fake' item. It does not have any value or whatsoever... I'm pretty dissatisfied with this one. <br>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
