<p>This is the printed poly bag promotional release. There&nbsp;was also a&nbsp; limited edition released&nbsp;&nbsp;of 150 white boba fett minifig's&nbsp;in a plain poly bag along with a copy of the 2010 Limited Edition Star Wars catalog that&nbsp;was an exclusive Toy Fair release</p>
<p>The ploy bag promotional release is for the 30th anniversary of The Empire Strikes Back, and has been given away free at various toy fairs , events, and shops. </p>
<p>The minifig is the usual minifig - 3 parts of the head, torso and legs, and the Boba&nbsp;Fett helmet and&nbsp;gun, so a total of 5 pieces. &nbsp;The fact it is in white and a limited release that currently has not been available in all counties, makes it unique. As a minifig it does nothing different to any other Boba Fett minifig. </p>
<p>The price of these has decreased as they have become more widely available when given away at different shops and events. Expect to pay&nbsp;under Â£15&nbsp;for this in the sealed bag. At this price, it is not too expensive for something that is currently on limited release. However, you are able to buy Star Wars sets for this amount. Thus, although it is not super rare,&nbsp;it really is an item for collectors as it will look good in your collection or on display. It can be used for playing with, however, you are able to buy Star Wars sets for the same amount that will provide a lot more playability and building experience. </p>
<p>Overall, unless you want to add a unique and collectable minfig to your collection, then I would recommend buying a set, especially for children. For collectors, this makes a worthwhile addition to any star wars minifig collection and display, hence a&nbsp;2 star rating. </p></DIV>",TRUE,2,1,1,2,2
