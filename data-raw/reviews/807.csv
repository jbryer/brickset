"A_Brickset_user","2003-07-10T00:00:00Z","","I didn't get this for a great deal, but it was designed quite well, and that made up for it. It had good amount of hinge pieces, and slopes. There might be too much grey, where there should've been more black. I just have to mention I built this with my left hand (I am right handed), and I wasn't even eight years old yet. (I had help with the hinges, and the model was supported by something before it was finished.) If you don't believe me, I don't have proof, so do or don't, I know the truth.

"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-12T00:00:00Z","","This is the only one of the RoboForce series I actually like, and I actually like it a lot. The construction is much more coherent than the others but what sets it apart the most is how awesome it looks. Which is strange, when making the legs I thought they were stumpy, when making the head I thought it was too big and when making the arms I thought they were too skinny, but it gels so well and somehow works out great. The only slight niggle is that the arms aren't very posable, but it has an almost prehensile tail, so no matter. I particularly love the ornamentation, aerials and greeblies and slopes dotted about give a kind of... fantasy style battle steed look, a bit like Kaadus with the feathers on in Episode 1, except on a huge robot. I can just imagine legions of these storming into battle scaring the bejeezus into anyone standing against them. Plus, of course, the awesomeness of trans neon green helmets with black visors. Usually sold for less than I think it's worth.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-21T06:38:35Z","Unique space set","This set does look cool, but it's rather lacking in good space type parts/bricks in my opinion.  And where's the 2nd minifigure?! This is quite a big set for just 1 figure.

I have to admit to liking the set, and I decided to buy it mostly on account of it's rarity and how cheap it was.  Overall its probably better than most space sets though and it's a rather fun set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-28T07:01:28Z","It's Cool!","I remember that this was one of my first sets that I'd ever got. I remember one con though, I was only 5 when I first got this, and I kept crying because the tubes near the Raptor's neck kept popping off! I found out later that the tubes were defective and couldn't stay on very well.
If I was still 5, I'd probably give this a &quot;4 out of 10 rating&quot;! Another neat featurette of this set is that the Raptor's feet move easily, which was something cool about it. It had some kind of yellow Technic piece connecting to the foot so that it could &quot;walk&quot;.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-01T23:13:57.537Z","Jurrasic Robo","This set is a strider, but unlike most striders that has gone before, this one doesn't even remotely looks like a strider, thanks to all the extra bricks that has gone into the design.  As a consequence, the design is highly polished, with movable hands and tail and a rotating raptor head.  The colour scheme works for this set, pairing black and grey with neon-yellow.  The use of slopes is masterful creating texture on the vehicle.  The pilot is placed on the back of the raptor, making it seem like a rider, which is another plus in good design.  Overall a very nice set, design wise and asthetic wise",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-08-20T12:13:42.45Z","Cool!","       This set is a relief from the overly blocky roboforce sets, as it is the only one remotely like a dinosaur. The shuffle step mechanism is not unique, since the design has been used for ages, even in the classic space sets! The legs don't move that far... but the set still moves. The minifigure is really cool, releiving us of the standard helmet. The decorated parts are also really cool, but the &quot;eyes&quot; could have been more fierce. The set also includes plenty of &quot;roboforce&quot; tiles. The head rotates 360 degrees, but the nech is very blocky and could have been smoothed. One gripe is that the set had two containers and one FREE tile to use, the other box could have beeen replaced by clips and tools, giving the set a much deserved 5/5. 
          At about $15-20 the set is a great buy, but unlike larger sets, excluded a description of the series, which would have done wonders if they just printed the little blurb on the smaller boxes. If anyone is interested, contact me and I'll send you a storyline blurb (I currently have the Aquasharks, UFO, Ice Planet 2002, and a short text from throwbots) straight from one of the boxes (very elusive information, I've been trying to find the texts for ages, so if anyone has a box with these texts, the info is much appreciated!)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
