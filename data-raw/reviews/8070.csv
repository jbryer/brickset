<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>bonus disc - The bonus disc has previews and bloopers for the new harry potter movie.</li>
<li>Magnets - You get four different magnets, each one has a different house crest.</li>
<li>Boxed set - The game comes in a boxed set.</li>
<li>The game - As&nbsp;I have said before the game is very good.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Magnets - The magnets aren't printed they are just stickers.</li>
</ul>
