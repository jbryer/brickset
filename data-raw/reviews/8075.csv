"superdave","2010-12-15T12:19:56.583Z","Flying is for Droids; This Set is for Parts","<p>A set maligned since its announcement for its price and apparently unappealing design, once finished this set yields a hearty ""hmm.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of its Episode II origin or its lack of participation in a large-scale space battle, Obi-Wan's Jedi Starfighter is, well, Obi-Wan's Jedi Starfighter. As a 10xxx-series Star Wars set, exceptional production values, detailed design,&nbsp;and a great part selection are expected.&nbsp;This set, while it doesn't fail on any of those points, can claim only to excel upon part selection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design looks just like the picture. There aren't hidden features or&nbsp;posable elements. While there are some well-executed techniques (the front wedge section relies on a studs-out system using lots of headlight bricks and 2x2 brackets; the connection of the quarter-dome elements behind the cockpit is rather elegant), there are no construction revelations here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts selection is where this set really shines. A number of elements are currently unique to this set (the unprinted windscreen, printed control tile, lime wing plates, white 3x3 quarter domes, white 2x2 tiles&nbsp;with stud, and the 4x4 dome with droid head print) and the range of included elements in dark red is quite notable (inverted slopes, bricks, plates, and tiles). There are some newer elements included as well: 1x4 slopes in white and 1x2 ""double cheese"" slopes in white and black. Those who complain that Star Wars sets offer little color beyond light and dark blue-gray (bley) have nothing to worry about with this set of white, black, dark red, lime, tan, and (of course) light blue-gray (bley) elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the finished set left me underwhelmed but the part selection provided a silver lining to that cloud. My personal opinion is that a discount of at least 25% off (in the US, look for a price of $75 or less) would meet the ""sweet spot"" for purchase. Based on the early response, this set may see further discounts into the 30-50% off range before it disappears. Much as it pains me to say it, don't buy this set until you see it marked down; but when you do,&nbsp;if you love a good parts pack, don't hesitate to grab it once it gets that sale tag.</p>",TRUE,2,5,4,2,2
"bluemoose","2010-12-28T07:19:26.87Z","Flawed Gem","<p>At its original price in the UK (£95) this set was ridiculously expensive, but at the new/improved 30%-off price (£66.49) it's a decent enough set ... I just hope this becomes the permanent price &amp; not just a short-term offer.<br></p><p>This is a model of Obi Wan Kenobi's Jedi Starfighter as featured in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Star Wars Episode 2:Attack of the Clones</span> &amp; other cartoons/computer games/etc.. Technically it's a <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">""</span>Delta-7 <i>Aethersprite</i>-class light interceptor"" in Obi Wan's colour scheme.<br></p><p>As with most of the UCS sets, the selection of parts &amp; the building experience are very good. There are some nice 'SNOT' (studs-not-on-top) advanced building techniques included and the basic model could form a strong foundation for a custom version of the Jedi Starfighter, or even act as the framework for an original model.<br></p><p>Again, as with the other UCS sets, it can be a challenging build for less experienced builders. Also, like most of the other UCS sets, there is little intrinsic play value. The cockpit is not designed for either a minifig or technic figure to sit in. The one major disappointment was the lack of an undercarriage; the ""minifig-scale"" versions include a working undercarriage, and this model appears to have the attachment points for a working undercarriage, but the pieces (and instructions) are not included, which seems to be a bizarre omission. However, a reasonable undercarriage can easily be built from other bricks.&nbsp; <br></p><p>The finished model is quite a bit larger than I had expected, and t makes a very nice display model, especially along side the other similarly scaled UCS sets (such as the X-Wing, snowspeeder, etc.).</p><p>I passed over this when it was first released, due to the obscene cost, but at the current (December 2010) reduced price I'd say it is a worthwhile addition to any UCS set collection and an enjoyable build.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,2,3
"jamal_lts","2011-04-26T07:14:12.7Z","Lets make it bigger.. throw in a display plate and call it a UCS ","The only reason i got this set was because of a boring night and i felt i need to build something fast. <br><br>The build duration is quite fast. It took me roughly 2 hours sifting through and putting the bricks in place. Repetition sets in during the wing phase.. with a slight difference. There are no interesting points during the build process... just that the size of the Star fighter takes you by surprise with the number of bricks involved. <br><br>I wonder why they chose this version of the Jedi Starfighter (Athersprite). I personally prefer the <span class=""rg_ctlv"">Eta-2 Atis interceptor. It looks more appealing and more complex. <br><br>It lacks the hyperspace booster ring. Would have been better if its included. I do not mind paying more for a better bigger UCS model.&nbsp; <br><br>I would recommend the set if you are a UCS collector or Star Wars Fan looking to build something... but if you are neither, this set is not really a must have.<br><br><br></span> ",TRUE,3,3,2,3,2
"donutsftw","2011-01-01T18:26:46.793Z","Decent set for its price","<p>I got this set for Christmas, so I didn't pay for it myself, but I will say that 100 USD seems like a fair price for the set. The ship features some neat SNOT techniques, but is really not very challenging, especially compared to some of the other UCS sets.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>nice selection of uncommon/hard to find parts, especially in dark red<br></li><li>cockpit computer screen is a printed tile as opposed to a sticker</li><li>cockpit itself is fairly detailed</li><li>as with all UCS sets, it looks pretty slick when you've got it displayed on its stand<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>most of the details around the cockpit are stickers<br></li><li>underside of ship has very little detail: there's no landing gear, and there's a long unnecessary gap that runs along the underside for the stand. Easy problems for a skilled builder to fix, but somewhat annoying as these are problems that wouldn't have taken too many extra parts to fix<br></li><li>in terms of movie accuracy, the cockpit windshield doesn't quite look right to me. In fact, I'd say that the windshield on the minifig-sized version of the ship (7143 Jedi Starfighter) looks more like the movie version than this one. Additionally, the windshield isn't mounted on any kind of hinge, and to remove the windshield you have to first remove a piece of the tail fin.</li></ul>Despite its flaws, I quite enjoyed building this set, and actually went and re-built the minifig sized version as well as the miniature version so that I could have all three on display side-by-side. Given the response its gotten, I wouldn't be surprised if its price got slashed further, so my recommendation is that if you can get this for less than its RRP, go for it.<br>

"Matt_mason","2013-10-15T17:28:00.303Z","Great set","I got this set off EBay in June for £65 in a buy it now deal. I missed it when it was released, it was on my to get list. when I saw it at a discount I snapped it up. I have a fair few of star wars ucs's and have to admit this is one on my favourites. I built it in a couple of hours and must admit it didn't tax the grey matter in the slightest , but the finished model is a joy to behold I have it on display along with my super star destroyer and the new X-wing and R2D2 and must &nbsp;admit I like this one the best. I shall get the B-wing next and that is another set that has it's fair &nbsp;share of bad press and I am sure I will like that as much. If you see it at a discount snap it up I am sure you will be glad you did.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,5,1,5
