"capnrex","2010-08-07T11:20:27.3Z","The Mexican","<p><strong>The Parts -</strong> The parts in this set are fantastic, we have the lovely sombrero with some small details around the brim, which is&nbsp;very big (about the size of a fifty pence piece if you live in the UK or Cad Bane's hat if you have a set with him in it). His head has a large moustache and a large smile which looks very good.&nbsp;The poncho is made up of two&nbsp;sections of material, one for the front and one for the&nbsp;back which are highly decorated, sadly the torso&nbsp;underneath the poncho is unprinted but you don't really see that area anyway! The maracas are also detailed with some&nbsp;patterning around the top of them, they look quite realistic and you get a spare one with the figure (so you get three). Finally there are the legs which are just plain old brown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Figure - </strong>I see this figure as being very nice for display and to play with, you could even make yourself an entire Mexican band with multiples of this figure! You could also harvest it for parts with that sombrero, the poncho and the maracas all being very desirable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall - </strong>I have to give this figure 9/10. I only knock a point off because it unfortunately has no printing on his torso, which would have been nice, but still it is a wonderful figure!</p>

"absolutelylez","2010-08-25T10:39:34.82Z","One of the best figures in Series two. Lots of unique parts!","Let me start from the top!<br><br>The sombrero is of course a new unique mould, and very large, about 4x4 studs in size (!)<br>It has very nice golden printings on the edge of the hat.<br>It is easy to remove, and clutches incredibly comfortable on the head.<br>The clutching mechanism is primitive and quite ugly but does the job well.<br><br>The head - nice big moustache. Can't say any more!<br><br>The torso is plain and unprinted. A printed torso would have been super to use in many ways, native south american dress, or even for red indians, etc. <br><br>The poncho makes up for it. It is very colourful and well designed to covery much of the torso.<br><br>The maracas are unique and have good quality green printing on them. An improvement could have been made by putting a bead in each maraca to make them shake. I guess this would have been expensive and difficult though.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3

Despite his overaall awesomeness, &nbsp;he is only a minifig so there isn't much in the way of playability or building experience.

all of the Collectable Minifigures the face is brand new. The sombrero is utterly huge and the black

"1UPminifig","2014-08-27T04:57:30.197Z","Mariachi Now Playing At All Taco Tuesdays! ","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>The Mariachi Guy was one of the first Collectible Minifigures that I got when I just started collecting them a couple of years back; when Series 2 was around. Since the Lego Movie line premiered, the Taco Man rehashed many of the pieces from Mariachi Guy with some color changes - it seems as if LEGO will be releasing a recolored version of <u>all</u> the collectible minifigures in time - I thought I&rsquo;d take a look back at the original.</p>

<p><strong>Polybag/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>This series&rsquo; polybag has a pretty light blue colour that&rsquo;s very attractive to the eye, unlike some of the other series polybags which (in my humble opinion) had truly ghastly colors (I&rsquo;m looking at you Series 4!) Right under our beloved LEGO logo - and the silver &amp; red lettering announcing <em>Minifigures!</em> - we&rsquo;re introduced to LEGO&rsquo;s choice picks seeking our attention and gleeful curiosity. Luckily our Mariachi Guy got front billing, only second to the power-punch Karate Master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Something which I really love about the polybag - that may be overlooked (just noticing it now) - is the question marks aligning with the top rim of the bag, signaling that our beloved bags are a random grab bag &ndash; so if you didn&rsquo;t already know, you&rsquo;re in for a surprise (and possibly some duplicates). So, be prepared, <em>you never know</em> <em>what you&rsquo;re gonna get</em> (unless, of course, you have magic fingers and a lot of time on your hands to feel up the bags). Beyond the little preview, piece count, and a warning, there isn&rsquo;t more than that to polybags.</p>

<p>The instructions sheet is the very brief, as you would expect from a set that only consists of a lone minifigure, so there&rsquo;s not much to say. On the first side of the instruction sheet, we are shown how to a build minifigure for those who don&rsquo;t already know, along with column list of body parts and accessories from Series 2. On the reverse side we have a simple checklist showing all the minifigures of the series -which I personally found helpful before discovering Brickset.Com.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Building </strong></p>

<p>For the most part the build of this minifigure is easy - like any other minifig - but the poncho does offer a challenge for those with stubby fingers or dexterity issues. LEGO ponchos are cloth pieces, (really just two capes) and you&rsquo;ll have to align the holes of the fabric right on top of each other in order to put them on the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; of the Lego man (of whom is briefly beheaded). It sounds simple, then you try it, followed by several attempts. There is no shame in asking someone for help, especially if that person is a pro at threading a needle or excellent repairing with superglue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p><strong>Helmet/Hair</strong>: With Mariachi Guy&rsquo;s headwear, we get what appears to have once been an exclusive mold for his green sombrero. The brim of the hat is wavy, the front being higher than the back, a nice detail to give some real world likeness. A minor detail to the brim is a little gold pattern running across the hat, breaking up the green monotone. An unassuming detail are the small indents near the top of the sombrero, helping to complete the hat shape. I&rsquo;m a big fan of the sombrero and I would say it&rsquo;s one of my favorite hat pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Head</strong>: The face for me is the true highlight of Mariachi Guy; I just love everything about it! He&rsquo;s got black arched eyebrows that frame is face quite nicely, having one of the few eyebrows LEGO designed to stand out. The eyes are basic minifigure fare (two black dots) and not anything special, but there is always something so loveable and cute about these sorts of Town minifigure eyes. Mariachi Guy has a rockin&rsquo; black bandito mustache that I fell in love with immediately - it&rsquo;s just a perfect fit. To finish off an already awesome face, we get a wonderful gleeful grin.</p>

<p><strong>Torso</strong>: The torso of Mariachi Guy is unassuming, comprising of a plain gray chest with tan arms. I suppose with the poncho covering up the torso, there wasn&rsquo;t much need to invest in a shirt. The multi-colored (tan, green and red patterns) on the poncho make up for the simple underside, as there is considerable detail in the cloth print. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Legs</strong>: Nothing special here, just standard brown legs. Even though the poncho adds flair, as I have seen some pretty outstanding leg prints from this line I can&rsquo;t help but feel a little disappointed there weren&rsquo;t anything special included here.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong>: The accessories we get with Mariachi Guy are two red/green maracas (of course!) with a complimentary pattern to the poncho. I don&rsquo;t have much to say about them, they&rsquo;re just simple and fun, but sadly they do not rattle. As is typical, the small black display stand piece is included.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>This guy - like a lot of the collectable minifigures - has rather scarce playability. Arms go up, arms go down. Etc. Mariachi Guy is perfect for all sets depicting a vacation; festivities (Mexican fiesta anyone?), beach scenes, etc. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to see someone put him to good use in a fan Brick movie, complete with sound effects.</p>

<p><strong>Suggested Pairings</strong></p>

<p>A good pair up with Mariachi Guy would be with his (obviously) long lost twin brother Taco Guy (from the LEGO movie minifigure series).Also, set <u>#850449: Minifigure Accessory Pack</u> has a beach party set-up and I could easily see some mariachi music helping Hula Girl swing her hips. Maybe LEGO will release a Mexican restaurant eventually, or a taco food truck! (Taco Tuesday&rsquo;s anyone?)</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion the Mariachi Guy is a unique minifigure, but he sadly has little support in the LEGO environments to not leave him somewhat out of place in the mainstream LEGO society. While I do find some of his features lacking, he has one off my all-time favorite faces and a very cool hat, I give this set a 4 out of 5.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>:&nbsp;When looking for him try feeling for the sombrero&nbsp;and then the maracas&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"sideswinger","2020-07-27T17:07:42.533Z","One of the best!","<p>So the first figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2 is the Mariachi or, most commonly called, Maraca Man. And I love this figure, so let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that green sombrero, which was new for the figure. It is a great piece too, and it looks especially neat in green. Nice printing all around the top too. It&#39;s just a marvellous piece, and I love how it came out.</p>

<p>He also does have a very nice face, with that exaggerated mustache, and his chipper smile looks great as well. No alternate facial expression, which is normal for 2010.</p>

<p>And skipping his poncho, we have his torso, which is pretty plain. It&#39;s just a plain light gray color, with no printing on the front or back. I do kind of wish they would have done that, but oh well. His arms are a different color than his body though, to where that&nbsp;are that light brown color.</p>

<p>Ad since his legs are plain brown with no printing, lets talk about his accessories, which are very great. First he has those two identical poncho pieces, which have an excellent pattern on them. It just looks awesome, and is highly detailed for 2010. Then he has those two maraca pieces as well, which also looks amazing. They were new for the figure, and they have the best detail for the maraca piece ever, in my opinion, to where it is just that nice green pattern which go 360 around them both. Just some great accessories.</p>

<p>And my overall opinion, is that this is an excellent figure for 2010, and it&#39;s especially great for two bucks. He&#39;s also my favorite figure in Series 2. With that being said, the Taco Tuesday Guy in the LEGO Movie Series is, in my opinion, a lot better. I also think the Series 16 Mariachi is a better figure. However, I do like him a lot better than the Series 20 Pinata Boy. He&#39;s also still my favorite in the series. And I think that wraps up this review! So check out my Series 1 reviews, and hopefully this helped you decide whether you wanted to buy it off Ebay, and thanks for reading!</p>
