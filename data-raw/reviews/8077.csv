I've bought two, but I'll probably buy more, because they're great! Nice details, amazing new equipment. I had a dream, now, it's finally come true!

"capnrex","2010-08-08T06:22:12.59Z","The Spartan","<p><strong>The Parts - </strong>The pieces for this minifigure are sublime, Lego has evidently taken great care when designing all of the new pieces and new prints that put together create one of the greatest minifigures I think I own. We will start with the helmet which is lovely, it is a kind of a misted golden with the plume adorning the top of the helmet being red. The sculpting for this part is fantastic and is certainly in the same class as the Arealight Spartan helmets. I think that one of the nicest touches on this figure has got to be the tiny lines running along the plume giving a sense of it being made up of hundreds of tiny feathers like a real Spartan helmet would have been. The head is also very&nbsp;well done with an angry expression surrounded by a very dark beard. Next he has a dark red cape which is a nice addition, this cape is a slightly darker colour than the&nbsp;red cape on&nbsp;The Wrestler from Series One which I did not expect. His torso is brilliant with a&nbsp;fantastically&nbsp;designed breastplate marked with rivets and decorative patterns&nbsp;everywhere. He is holding a&nbsp;grey spear, the head of which is a lighter grey than the pole it is placed on. I am very pleased they did not use the spear from many of the Castle or Kingdoms sets as this new spear just feels a little bit more realistic. The shield is quite simple. It is&nbsp;circular with a handle at the back and a stud for attaching something at the front. This stud gves the possibilty of adding some sort of decoration onto the shield which would improve it further.&nbsp;There is a nice rim&nbsp;around the edge of&nbsp;the shield and the colour for it is well chosen.&nbsp;The legs are also excellent with a sort of red skirt printed on them. Better than that though is the detail on his feet of some shoes or sandals which contiues around the side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Figure - </strong>This is certainly the best all round figure of the Series with great detail which puts it up there with the best for display, and excellent playability thanks to the weapons included. This figure could certainly be desired in multiples for either simply the wonderful parts or for the possibility of creating huge battles with these minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall -</strong>&nbsp;The figure as you can probably tell is in my opinion totally perfect and so obviously&nbsp;it has a mark reflecting that, which is of course 10/10! If you want to only get one figure from this&nbsp;Series make&nbsp;it this one!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

<p>first i think we will start with the legs. the roman kilt was a good touch since the romans were SPARTA or something like that and the shoes were a even better touch the torso has like a golden piece of armor with a six pack but i think they could of put some battle scars or cuts on his arms. the shieldis dull butt the spear is good because of the flexi bit at the end and the cape is dark red for a change. the face looks freaky &nbsp;but is very detailed and the helmet is a fake gold kind of colour with a red bumpy bit on top but there's nothing much to that</p>

He is my favourite of Series 2 and also Series 1 and 2 combined, and he is an incredible minifig. The only thing rated down is the playability, as he is only a minifig. His pieces are some of the best I have ever seen. His new spear, shield and helmet are incredible and LEGO has captured the Spartan spirit perfectly. Overall, the Spartan Warrior is a MUST HAVE for all LEGO fans, and I would definitely and whole-heartedly recommend him to everyone.",FALSE,5,5,5,3,5
"Lego_Minifig_Man","2010-10-10T22:51:58.347Z","For Sparta!!","<p>This is definetely one of my favourite minifigures! I got this for $2.99. I only bought this one from Series 2, and considered buying the vampire.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br/>Accessories &amp; Helmet<br/>This is the first set that features this helmet. It has a nice darker red color on the... brush part. And the rest is gold. He has a spear, which is new. It has a nice diamond shape on the tip. The tip and the rest of the spear are two different colors. The tip is gray, and the rest is dark gray/black. He has a -I think new- sheild. It's really cool, and has a stud peice on the front so you can attach some studs. The minifig has to have his hand turned horizontally, unless you want it to look like he's purposely holding it away from himself. He also has a nice cape! It didn't come in cardboard or anything like that, for people who feel the packages to identify the minifigure. It's a dark red color. &nbsp;It's nothing special, but who doesn't like capes? And like all the others, it comes with a standard stand. The stand is an 3x4 black flat peice but with only four studs on top.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Head<br/>He has a black beard which is printed on the head, not a separate peice, and doesn't look too friendly! He has yellow skin, which is normal for a minifigure excluding ones from&nbsp;licensed themes.&nbsp;He has some eyebrows, and is clenching his teeth preparing for battle!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Torso<br/>His torso is a nice brown color. The front has printed on gold armor. His arms are yellow/bare, and he has normal yellow hands.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Legs<br/>His legs have a... well I don't want to make him sound too girly, but I'm gonna call it a skirt. The top peice is colored dark brown. The back part isn't printed, which isn't too surprising, but it kind of makes him look like his butt is showing. There's one big problem. Unless he is leaning forward a bit, the bottom part of the skirt is cut off from the top part, which looks very strange. He also has some lines or somthing on his feet. I'm not sure what it's supposed to be, because it's only printed on one side, and it's not at the bottom part of his foot. It may supposed to be sandals or shoes...??<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Playability<br/>This has lots of playability! I mean, c'mon! It's a gladiator! Also you can build an army of them, which would look great if you switched the heads!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Conclusion<br/>I will miss the barcodes in Series 3, but oh well. I guess lego thinks they'll sell more- But for me that means I won't buy any. I gave it a low building experience because it was nothing special. And to be honest I'm not sure what they mean by that. If there was problems rate it low? Nothing special rate it low? Not problems rate it high? Anyways, this is a must-have minifig! Buy it now!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly,&nbsp;this is by far the best of the collectable minifigs for me! It's so classic and iconic... and in addition&nbsp;to those, it's LEGO, which makes it more iconic!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The helmet is the nicest&nbsp;I have seen in any minifig. And the prints are way better than the series 1 figs as the former have an ingrained look. The shield could use some decorative prints&nbsp;to make it bolder, maybe like a Gorgon's cut head. But I bet you could hardly build a testudo out of this if ever you have more of this fig! Still, it won't spoil everything else! The spear looks better than the old ones, but the diameter of the&nbsp;staff seems to be way bigger than the handle of the shield, so do be careful with it...it might break the fig's hand&nbsp;in the long run! I also don't know why they have to make the spearhead that soft, but I guess it's much safer for the kids that way.</p>

It's hard to argue with that; everything, from the unique two-tone helmet to the torso printing to the fierce expression on his face is pretty much perfect. For most people, if they bought 10 random packs of minifigures and came out with 8 or 9 Spartans, they wouldn't be all that upset, because the more Spartans you have, the cooler/more imposing they look as a group.<br><br>The only real complaint that could be voiced is that the printing on the legs doesn't go up quite far enough, so there's a thin yellow gap between the red leg connector and the leg printing, but that's a minor flaw at best, and one common to most of the collectible minifigures line.<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4

"sideswinger","2020-07-28T17:10:55.737Z","An EXCELLENT minifigure!","<p>So the second figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2 is the Spartan Warrior, and I do really like this figure. So let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that helmet, which is not two pieces, as it may seem. And it is an awesome piece, with the gold moulding and all, and it also has that red top, which I think is printed instead of dual-moulded. It is just a very cool piece, and I&#39;m not sure if it was new for the figure or not. I would guess it was, but I might be wrong.</p>

<p>Then we have his face, which has a pretty nice print on it. I love the eyebrows, as well as his big black mustache. I also like that angry expression. No alternate face, which is normal for a two dollar figure.</p>

<p>And he has that red cape between his torso and head, and it has no fancy pattern or anything. It is that thick material as well, because the soft felt cape was introduced in 2016, if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso, which has some very nice printing. I love his golden breastplate, and it&#39;s just some very good printing for 2010. And I couldn&#39;t find any good pictures, so my guess is that he has no back torso printing, which is normal for 2010. And if he does have back printing, well that&#39;s great.</p>

<p>Then we have is legs, which have some pretty complex printing for back then. The front of his legs&nbsp;have&nbsp;some great ruffle printing, and he has some awesome shoe printing too. But he has side leg printing, which is very neat. There is sort of a gap in the front and side, but the fact that they printed them at all is great. And they put some side shoe printing on him as well, so just some very complex shoe printing.</p>

<p>And then he has two great accessories; the spear, and the shield, both f which were new for the figure. And the spear looks great, with that light gray tip. It is made of rubber too, which is interesting. And then the rest of it is plastic, so it is dual-moulded. Then his shield looks nice, with that stud in the center, but it has no printing, which is sort of sad, but oh well.</p>

<p>And my overall opinion, is that this is an excellent figure. He&#39;s just very complex for 2010, with the side printing, and the fact that he had three new pieces is awesome. And you get all that for only two bucks. That is amazing and very surprising. And since LEGO has had lots of warrior-like CMF&#39;s, this is one of my favorites, as well as one of the best in the series. The Maraca Man was my favorite, but this guy is extremely close. Definitely second best, if not first-best. Is that a word? I don&#39;t know. But I think that wraps up this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
