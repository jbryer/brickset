However the whip is in a new colour and the torso is also very nice. I will start with the hat, the hat is black, just like it was in The Magician from Series One. This piece could be useful for figures at a wedding or some kind of party though so is&nbsp;certainly worth having. The head is quite nice with black eyebrows, a black curly moustache and a rather terrified looking smile. The torso is an excellent print with a black bow tie, a red jacket with a red and black collar and a crisp white shirt. There is also a white flower and some buttons for added detail. He is wearing white gloves which look brilliant against the red of his arms and torso. The whip he is holding appeared recently for the first time in Prince Of Persia sets, but it has not been seen in white before. The legs have white hips and black trousers to complete the look of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Figure -</strong> I think this figure would be fairly good for display as it would look excellent with The Clown and The Magician from Series One. The playability though is what truly is fantastic about this minifigure. You could put on an entire circus with some Clowns, The Magician and The Ringmaster! I can see few reasons to buy more than one of this figure as there are not many desirable pieces, the whip and hat could be interesting but there are definetely better ways of spending your money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall - </strong>Overall I give this figure 8/10. I take points off for the lack of any new pieces in this minifigure unlike many of the others that have appeared in Series One or Two.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"Firox_5000","2010-09-13T16:33:26.633Z","Nice lion tamer","<p>The&nbsp; Ring master comes in the series 2 figure collection and has 6 pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When built he looks very nice. He has a white coloured whip in his left hand as well as a traditional top hat on his head. he also has a detailed torso and a expression on his face which makes him look either theatrical or scared. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>out of the other 16 figures I would say he is one of the medium figures and would suite a Circus, themepark or town setting in a lego world.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3

Its expression was mine when I found these unexpectedly :P But also works well when you make scenes with other figures..especially with the traffic cop!<br>Other pieces like the top hat and the torso are really nice and useful in many things.<br>Recommended<br><br>Ceroknight<br>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,5
"AETerry","2011-10-04T18:56:34.933Z","Ringmaster Review","I picked this up at the latest Brickcon I went to from a vendor. I have to say if I wasn't so impulsive and at a convention, I could have checked out the price of this figure and gotten it for a bit less. As is, do your homework for pricing before picking up any of the discontinued Collectible Minifigures. Compared to other lone minifigures that I have picked up for as much as $10, the price I paid for this one wasn't too bad either.<br><br>As far as the Ringmaster goes, he is perfect. It makes me want to collect up any of the other circus based minifigures and try completing a Circus MOC. Take away his whip and top hat to fit him with other pieces and you've got a figure that can be used for a rider at a horsemanship show or a fancy diner party.<br><br>Given that this is one of the earlier figures to come from LEGO for the CM line, he's done very well and the detailing and choice of accessory pieces complements it very well. I love it and I am quite pleased with this one.<br>",TRUE,4,1,1,5,4
"tkettle9719","2011-12-27T16:59:15.753Z","Disappointment...","I got this after a trip from my parents, who had gone to Borders to get me a few minifigures (particularly the mariachi man), and gave me this unfortunate minifig. <br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The face is cute.<br></li><li>-I also rather like the top hat, for MOCs.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The figure is just not extravagant or creative; a few scratches would be nice.<br></li><li>-The overall figure seems a bit too undetailed.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This figure isn't horrible, but it isn't exactly great either. Save your money, and don't get it. <br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,4
"StarKiller22515","2020-02-09T19:18:57.683Z","And for our next performance...","<p>The recolor of the whip was okay and make it look cleaner which is good. The top hat and face print are very nice as well as the torso print, the legs are okay and draw your eyes to his upper section which is good. The only thing that I don&#39;t really like about this figure is &ldquo;What am I ever going to use this for?&rdquo; I don&#39;t really want a ringmaster because there is not circus like sets in the LEGO line. Overall this is a very nice looking figure its just that there is no set on shelves for it to fit into.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-07-28T18:28:04.797Z","The WORST in the series","<p>So the third figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2 is the Ringmaster, and he is an absolutely horrendous figure. But let&#39;s take a closer look.</p>

<p>On top we have that top hat, which is just plain black with no printing whatsoever. It was not new for the figure, and it isn&#39;t really that exciting.</p>

<p>Then we have his face, which is a little more interesting. I like that crazy mustache, as well as his face, which has that open mouth expression. It is a pretty neat face print overall, and probably my favorite part of the figure.</p>

<p>Next we have that torso, which has some okay printing. Nothing that exciting though. It has that red&nbsp;jacket, with the black bow tie and all, then he also has that white undershirt. No back torso printing, which, as common as it may be for 2010, would&#39;ve made the figure a tad bit more interesting. Oh well.</p>

<p>His legs have no printing, but it is sort of interesting how the connector part is white and the two separate&nbsp;leg pieces are black. But nothing exciting, therefore let&#39;s move on to the accessory, which is also very boring. It&#39;s just a boring whip, which was new in white. It really&nbsp;hurts how he has no baby lion or anything else. Just a lone whip.</p>

<p>But my overall opinion, is that this figure is downright awful. The face printing is the only good thing about him. I just seriously despise this figure. He suffers from the same thing as the Series 1 Super Wrestler, to where the choice is niche and the execution is terrible. He&#39;s just one-hundred percent my least favorite of the series.And the value for two bucks is terrible. But I think that wraps up this review, so check out my other Series 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
