With her green skin, equipped with&nbsp;broom and hat, she's a nicely detailed figure, that one's sure to find a use for(while waiting for Dorothy and the rest of the inhabitants of Oz(not likely, but one can hope)). And remember, keep away from water!",FALSE,5,4,5,4,5
"capnrex","2010-08-08T07:39:59.397Z","The Witch","<p><strong>The Parts - </strong>Well there has to be one, and sadly it is this. The worst figure in my opinion to come out of Series Two. No brand new pieces, but some new printing. I will start on the hat which is really dissapointing, there is no detail and while the sculpt is good there is no highlighting on the buckle or anywhere on the hat which is a shame.The head is quite good with&nbsp;green skin, there are some warts on the figure&nbsp;and a rather sinister smile, she&nbsp;also has black eyebrows and some dark green lipstick. The torso is nice with a torn feel to it,&nbsp;she has some green showing at the top, a green band around her waist and a golden buckle. The broomstick is&nbsp;quite fun&nbsp;and a good inclusion&nbsp;with the minifigure, I think they should have also put a cauldron or maybe a frog in with the figure&nbsp;as&nbsp;an extra touch. This figure does not have normal legs, instead having a two-by-two slope with some printing on it. There is a dark tan&nbsp;spell book&nbsp;with some pages and a purple bookmark hanging out.&nbsp;There is also&nbsp;a picture of a frog and the word 'Spells' on the front cover of the book. Details like these just about rescue this figure from being a total disaster. There is also a small bottle of pink potion&nbsp;and a tear mark on the dress. The spell book and the potion both hang from a well printed little chain crossing the top of the slope part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Figure - </strong>I think that the figure could be displayed reasonably well and also would be good for play if you had a cauldron piece spare to go with her. I can see absolutely no reason for buying multiples of this figure as there is not much&nbsp;potential for using the pieces elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall -</strong> &nbsp;Overall I have to give this figure 5/10 as it lacks any really interesting features or pieces for me.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
"absolutelylez","2010-08-28T20:04:08.763Z","Eliminate your skepticism!","<p>The figure uses the same hat and skirt block that the previous (Fantasty Era) witch uses. ((Note however, that this block is different to the Hubble Bubble witch from 1996-8, as it has a stud in the middle of it, allowing it to stick to the minifig stand.))<br />
<br />
With regards to the hat, it is obviously a&nbsp;lower quality&nbsp;mould, as it is visibly less shiny when compared to other hats, and has a number that is absent on the previous versions.<br />
<br />
The face is excellent. The fact that it is green distinguishes it from previous witches and makes it seem far scarier than the previous two. There are visible cracks to the skin.<br />
<br />
The printing on the witch's top is basic and not interesting, it is clearly beaten by the fantasy era witch. However, the skirt sports a chemical vial, a book of spells with a very detailed frog on it and a visible sign of wear and tear. This makes the witch seem somewhat closer to the fairy tale image we have of her.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, she will go well with your two other witches, and with a cauldron, I can easily see them acting out the first scene of Shakespeare's Macbeth.<br />

I like the fact that you can make the minifigs&nbsp; sit or in a walking position but with the witch, this isn't an option with the wedge they included instead. The hat and brook are quite good and everything else too but this spoils the figure.If they had included a 2x1 brick for this purpose then perhaps the figure would have fared better.<br>",TRUE,2,2,3,2,3
"SirJamie","2010-10-13T15:31:38.327Z","The Witch","<p>This was my first minifigure I bought of Ebay for a total price of £2.25 which I think is quite fair. Iv'e been seeing a lot of reviews recently branding this figure as the worst of Series 2 and to be honest, I dont think this figure gets enough credit for what its worth. </p>
<p>You'll probably disagree because of the lack of detail on the hat and its uniqueness but it is arguably the best Witch LEGO have produced yet. My favourite part has to be the face because how often do we ever get a green face? The hideous green colour and her features give the Witch an evil presence.</p>
<p>Her black dress is nicely detailed with rips and stitches plus we also get a lovely purple potion bottle. The green belt is also a good touch as it goes with her face.</p>
<p>The idea of adding the predictable broom stick is ok I guess but why not add a potion bottle or the elegant green frog for her to hold?</p>
<p>The only thing that really disappoints me is the lack of detail in her hat, even the Wizard from the Castle theme is more spectacular.</p>

"8BrickMario","2015-10-01T23:27:44.86Z","Double, Double...","<p>Seeing as it&#39;s the beginning of October as I write this, I thought I&#39;d get in the Halloween mood by reviewing spooky stuff! I realize that the things I&#39;ll be reviewing are long past being on sale, but perhaps they can be found online.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging for Series 2 is a simple blue color. The pamphlet included looks strange in retrospect, as LEGO hadn&#39;t yet perfected the design.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Witch has some pretty nice ones. Notably, she was the first minifigure to have Bright Green parts. All of her pieces can conceivably be used in other contexts, so that&#39;s really good!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Must I even comment on this any more? I&#39;ll remove the heading in my next review.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a really nice classic witch! Taking some influence from the famous witch of Oz (who later got an official figure!), she&#39;s witchy&nbsp;and creepy. Her Bright Green head really made her unique at the time, and it still does. Her face is appropriately ugly with two warts and a wicked grin. Her tattered robes have a green belt at the waist, and a spellbook and potion bottle hang on a beaded chain. There&#39;s a tear in the bottom, stitched up with pink thread. All of her lower dress printing provides a splash of color, and looks great. The broomstick completes the look.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like her! She&#39;s decently scary and does a great job of capturing a witch&#39;s look. The only change I made to her was getting rid of her black &quot;gloves&quot; and giving her green hands to match her face (this was only possible when the Series 5 Lizard Man came out, so I waited for a while!) Overall, I&#39;d highly recommend her to round out any medieval or Halloween scene.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-07-29T16:32:20.323Z","Could be better","<p>So the Witch is the fourth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2, and I&#39;m not exactly a huge fan of her. But let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Going from top to bottom, we have that witch hat, and it&#39;s caste in black. Nothing at all special with the piece, since it&#39;s been around for ions, but it does, of course, fit the figure. I do like that detail above the rim though, with the black strap and all.</p>

<p>Next we have that spooky face, which does look pretty neat and creepy. I love how it&#39;s that dark green color, and I also like how she has that evil smile. So creepy. She has that ugly&nbsp;mole on her as well, which I guess is witch-like. No alternate printing, because that would look very strange from behind.</p>

<p>Next we have that torso, which does have some pretty neat printing overall. I like&nbsp;that green strap with the orange belt buckle in the middle, and it&#39;s just some decent&nbsp;printing overall. I do wish they would&#39;ve done a little bit more printing, but oh well. No back torso printing, which is common for 2010.</p>

<p>Then we have that dress, which is the first ever CMF to have that&nbsp;dress piece. It wasn&#39;t new for the figure, but it&#39;s neat to get in this cheap figure. it does have some nice printing on it as well, with that book and that potion. I also like that rip in it.</p>

<p>She only has one accessory, which is that broom piece. It&#39;s a very obvious accessory, which I don&#39;t mind one bit. Nothing goes with a witch as good as a broom, and it&#39;s caste in that reddish brown color, which looks great. The piece was not new for the figure, but like I said, it fits. It has some nice moulding on top too.</p>

<p>And overall, I think she is a pretty good choice, and she looks pretty neat for 2010. She&#39;s also&nbsp;cool for a two dollar figure. So why the two-star choice? Well first off, while she has some decent printing for 2010, she just isn&#39;t too exciting nowadays. And second, we&#39;ve got so many better LEGO Witches, that this one just seems pretty undesirable. Like the Series 14 Wacky Witch. That thing is stinking amazing. But that might be in my top 5 minifigures of all time, so you can&#39;t beat that figure. But anyway, this same exact figure came in the 2012 Halloween Accessory pack, which also featured a remake of the Serifs 1 Zombie, and a ghost, so that doesn&#39;t make this figure bad, but the fact she isn&#39;t exclusive really makes me wish she was more interesting. Nonetheless, it&#39;s a witch, which makes her pretty iconic. And she doesn&#39;t look awful, I just think there&#39;s been LEGO witch&#39;s who&#39;ve looked loads better.</p>

<p>So I hoped this helped you decide whether you wanted to pay top dollar for it on Ebay, and if you ask me, I would buy the other figures first, but if you&#39;re trying to get the whole series, you gotta get her. And check out my other Series 1 and two reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
