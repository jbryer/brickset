"capnrex","2010-08-08T10:46:22.063Z","The Vampire","<p><strong>The Parts -</strong> The parts for this figure are really outstanding among the new Series Two figures. The cape has got to be the best part, it is so well done. I will start with the hair which is exactly the same as that which comes with The Judoka, I think it suits The Vampire very well. It is black and is the same piece that appears on Count Dooku and Chancellor Palpatine as mentioned in my review of The Judoka. The face is brilliant, it is white and he has black eyebrows, red eyes including some grey detailing around them) and a huge grin, of course with his two elongated canine teeth. The cape is simply fantastic as I mentioned earlier, it is just one piece of fabric which has to be cleverly folded to go&nbsp;around his neck and stick up and down, I adore the spiked edges which look excellent. His torso is also very nice with a white shirt, a red waistcoat, a black jacket and a gold necklace which has some lovely detail. He is also wearing a little red bow tie under his collar. He wears white gloves on his hands with&nbsp;which he can hold the bat which comes with him, the bat is quite an old piece but it is still very nice for it to appear with the figure. His legs are black with no decoration which looks just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Figure -</strong> This minifigure could certainly be displayed very well, especially if you have a coffin piece or can make one!&nbsp;The playability with this figure is also very good with many possibilties. I can see only one reason to get more than one of this figure and that is for the parts! Even if you get it only for the cape it is worth it! Also this is a cheap and easy way to get a bat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall -</strong> I have to give this figure another 10/10, it is starting to feel like I am giving out too many, but all the figures that get the magic 10 have earnt it this Series, it really is fantastic. The possibilities for displaying this minifigure are endless, which a reason to get it alone, and the reason I had to give it 10/10!</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"absolutelylez","2010-08-24T13:22:25.49Z","Better than the original Dracula figure and worth collecting.","<p>Overall, this minifigure is *excellent*.&nbsp; Compared to the original Dracula, released in the &ldquo;Studios&rdquo; line, (see here <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=1381-1"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=1381-1</a> ) there have been many, many improvements in almost all aspects.</p>
<p>The hair is a new mould. It gives the impression of hair that has been gelled very heavily, it appears very greasy. The mould has been designed in such a way that the forehead of Dracula is very exposed, more than you would expect.</p>
<p>The printing on the body is of high quality, though disappointingly there is only printing on the front. It is very detailed and you can clearly see a shirt, jacket and then coat. There are many more details and curves compared to the Studios original. The printing is clear and bright, as always.</p>
<p>The cape is interesting because of its smaller upright part. First you put on the cape like normal, putting the two bottom wholes over the neck, then you sort of &ldquo;double fold&rdquo; the second part over. It is very fiddly, but worth it for the excellent effect. The red cape from Studios Dracula seems to be of the same design. I think that both red and black are good colours. Ideally, it would be red on the inside, and black on the outside.</p>
<p>The accessory, the bat, is nothing interesting. I am sure we all have quite a few of those already.</p>

"Lego_Minifig_Man","2010-11-21T11:01:12.11Z","I am Count Dracula!!","<p>This is definetly one of my favourite minifigures! I bought this for utimately&nbsp;$3.45. I thought about buying this before when I bought the Spartan Warrior, but, I'm not sure why, I decided not to. I recenetly decided I should've got it so I did (duh!). On to the reivew!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He comes with a bat, which has the same mold as it did years ago. I'm not a big fan of the bat mold, but oh well. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also&nbsp;comes with a cape. Oh. My GOSH. I had the hardest time trying to get that cape on him!! It's that dumb top part, which, by the way, is connected to the bottom part of the cape. I would've been better if they were two seperate peices. If I folded one part the other got twisted up and-- ugh. I would explain on here how to get it on, but I just can't put it in words. One thing's for sure-- I'm never removing his head from his torso. But thankfully it's a pretty good cape. It sticks out a bit from his back, which isn't great, but okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has the same hair as Dollar Bill&nbsp;from the agents series, but obviously his is black instead of green. It's put back which I think makes him look pretty&nbsp;good, for a vampire, that is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He comes with a normal minifig stand. Black, flat, 3x4 studs with only 4 in&nbsp;a&nbsp;line on top.</p>
<p><strong>Head</strong></p>
<p>His head is all white. He has large thick eyebrows and creepy red eyes. He's also showing off his fangs. I don't know why, but I think he's looking to his left. I think the white on his head is a very very tiny tiny bit different from the color of his hands.</p>
<p><strong>Torso</strong></p>
<p>He has a black suit on, with a very nice dark red vest and a bow tie of the same color. He's also wearing some kind of necklace. No printing on the back? Dissapointing.&nbsp;His arms are just black, and his hands are white.</p>
<p><strong>Legs</strong></p>
<p>His legs are just black. Nothing special by any means.</p>
<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>
<p>He is actually full of playability. He goes well with those old Studious sets, and can be used to wreak havoc on your un-suspecting lego city! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I gave it a low building experience because of the horrible-to-put-on&nbsp;cape.&nbsp;But in the end, this is a great figure! Buy it now!</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,3

"SirJamie","2010-10-13T16:06:19.48Z","The Vampire","<p>One of my top minifigures in the collection. The Vampire is my second minifigure that I bought of Ebay for Â£3.75 which is ok as it is a very popular figure. Everything about this figure is brilliantly unique!</p>
<p>The Vampire's head is what I like the best&nbsp;as the eyes are so bulging and pretty. The darkened bags around them make him look more undead and of course his pasty white face.</p>
<p>Oh how I love and hate the cape! The material and shape is good but trying to get the damm thing on is harder than trying to convince your parents that LEGO isnt just for little kiddies!</p>
<p>His cloths remind me of a time when I was younger were I was dressing up as a Vampire for Halloween. Anyways, The choice of blood red and deep black colours adds to his persona greatly.</p>
<p>His hairpiece relates to the classic era of Vampires which I like very much&nbsp;as the&nbsp;hair is also one of LEGO's newest pieces.</p>
<p>Since I bought my Vampire of the FireStar website I&nbsp;sadly did not recieve his pet bat which I was very angry about.</p>

"Carl","2010-12-25T20:04:56.56Z","Vampire","The Vampire is an awesome minifig, and is my second favourite of the series 2 minifigs. His vampiric face is designed perfectly and he has an awesome cape just like any vampire should. His pet bat is a nice addition. He is only a minifig, however, so he doesn't have as good a playability rating as some of the larger play sets. Value for money receives 5/5 simply because I got series 1 and 2 for Christmas, so I got this guy for free. Overall the Vampire is an absolute must have for all LEGO fans, and I recommend him to all.",FALSE,5,5,4,3,5
"Orthobotrex","2011-01-09T01:03:24.563Z","The Groovy Blood Sucker!","<p>This fig makes a great addition to anyone's collection. It's a classic representation of the vampire we all know that made it famous, sans the lycans and the love stories. This character has been into several genres, from&nbsp;a children's educational show, to comedies, and to quintessential horror roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;But don't worry,&nbsp;he's not that scary. Which makes me wonder if there will be a lady vampire? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assembly is nothing out of the ordinary, but I guess the feeling of owning one of these adds to the build experience. The cape is great, though I had a hard time figuring out how to fit it into the neck as it is one piece with the oversized collar. And it's a good thing he's almost all black, so the prints shouldn't be that much of an issue. The face&nbsp;has a sheepish grin that hides the intent of the bearer...and it's a good thing that the eyes are not wholly blood-shot.&nbsp;The simplicity of it all expounds the merits of this thing. And don't forget the bat...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tips for first timers, like me: you fold the cape at the junction with the collar then place the holes of the collar to the cape bend&nbsp;with the collar facing&nbsp;up. The holes can then be overlapped to each other before placing it over the neck. Another near disaster for me was the headpiece as I thought it was a straightforward placement (and maybe it really was just me)...I tried to jam it in the usual way into the head's stud and I thought at first that it didn't fit. It was later that I found out that it had to be tilted a little to the back, giving the fig a forehead (an intelligent fig this is, then?),&nbsp;so it could go in smoothly without damaging anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, great fig and a good buy as well!</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"AETerry","2011-04-18T23:33:17.78Z","Vampire Review","<p>At long last I finally got around to getting my hands on the Vampire minifigure and he sure is sweet looking for the classic Bela Legousi Dracula image. White hands and head to give the appearance of being deathly pale, red eyes. The print job for the torso is great. The cape though can be a bit of a pain if you're not sure at first how it's done. The bat I don't care too much for, they almost could have left it out and this figure would still be fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, price wise, even paying more after the series is gone, he's a worthy addition to any minifigure collection, especially for those who are trying to collect up all the monster themed minis or for MOCs. He's perfect as is and not much more that LEGO could have done to perfect this minifigure.</p>",TRUE,5,2,1,5,5

This minifigure is really quite a spiffing fellow. He has a better face, hair and torso than the original lego vampire, but his cape is only 1 color. The bat is a nice touch too. I actually bought 2, and gave one really long black hair like me represent me. He was my first collectible minifig, and I am very pleased. I think that a vampiress would be an excellent edition to the collectible minifig line. the building experience could be better, as it is just a minifig. the cape is neat though.

"8BrickMario","2015-10-02T18:17:43.777Z","Am I batty for him?","<p>The Vampire was a necessary addition to the still-new CMF theme, and paired well with the Witch? Is he a good figure?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>The blue packaging looks nice, and it&#39;s interesting to see how the design has been refined over time.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Vampire has some nice pieces. His hair (relatively new at the time) was available for the first time in black (alongside the Karate Master&#39;s), and is a nice style. His torso and cape are also quite useful.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I think the assembly deserves mention this time, in regards to the cape. It was confusing to fold properly, as it requires the collar to be folded behind the cape, and for the cape to then be folded on itself like a standard LEGO cape. As there were no instructions for capes&nbsp;(until Series 14!), this was frustrating.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like him. He&#39;s a classical vampire that could be either sinister or friendly. His large collared cape gives him quite a presence, and his outfit is very useful for any 18th/19th century nobility. His hair serves to depict a vampire&#39;s heavily styled hairdo and widow&#39;s peak.&nbsp;His face is printed in a grin, with his large fangs being clearly visible. His face is appropriately pale, and his eyes are red and sunken. He comes with the classic bat piece as an accessory; either to serve as one of his friends, or his transformation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While he&#39;s far from my favorite monster minifigure, I still think he does a great job of representing the iconic vampire image. I would recommend him.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-07-29T17:11:53.34Z","Not the best vampire","<p>So the fifth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2 is the Vampire, and he&#39;s a pretty great figure. So let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting from top to bottom, we have that black hair piece, which I think is the one most commonly called the &quot;widows peak&quot; hair. It does look cool as well, and it fits the figure very well. I&#39;m not totally sure if it was new for the figure or not, but either way, it looks great on him.</p>

<p>Then we have his face print, which looks great. It looks really spooky and all, and I just love how it turned out. I like how it&#39;s white too, and I also like his black eyebrows. Then he has those red eyes, with the gray around them, and his white fangs look great as well. No alternate face either, which is common for 2010.</p>

<p>And I normally count capes as accessories, but let&#39;s just get right to it. That cape and big collar is just one whole piece, and it does look great, with the pointy tips and all. It really fits the figure too. However, with that being said, It is terribly difficult to put on. You gotta line up all the holes, and it&#39;s just a pain. But nonetheless, when you get past that, it looks great on the figure.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, which has some awesome printing. I love this black jacket, as well as his red vest, and his white undershirt looks great as well. He has that red bow-tie on, and the gold chain looks neat too. I also like how the black jacket has those red highlights. And I&#39;m not for sure, but I&#39;m pretty sure he has no back torso printing.</p>

<p>And since his legs are plain black with no printing, let&#39;s move on to his accessory, which isn&#39;t anything special. It&#39;s just that classic bat piece, which is a very fitting accessory. It wasn&#39;t new for the figure, but it still looks neat.</p>

<p>And overall, I think the figure itself looks really cool, especially for 2010. However, a Vampire is just a figure that&#39;s been made way too much in the LEGO System. And the vampire that&#39;s apparent in most of the Monster Fighter sets looks especially similar to this one. I mean we had vampires in the LEGO Studios lines, Monster Fighters, Fright Nights, LEGO Movie 2, lots of the promotional Halloween sets, just so many sets. And, like the Series 2 Witch, this figure just gets lost in the mix. But I think that wraps up this review, so check out my other Series 1 and 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
