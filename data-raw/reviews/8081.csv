<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>first the cop uniform is a nice touch but the legs are plain and dull but the helmet is awesome. It goes well with a motor bike and the speeding ticket is ok but hard to fit in his hand but the two pairs of handcuffs are awesome as. There is a spare pair to catch multiple criminals.</p>

<p>Hope this review helped</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5

"Guy7","2010-09-03T22:47:25.947Z","Nice Cop","The Traffic Cop is one of my favorites in Series 2. He offers a different uniform that the standard LEGO police officer.<div><br></div><h4>Head</h4><div>The helmet is obviously made in China. The large flat sections advertise the poor quality. The face itself is a very nice design though. I love that LEGO decided to use aviators for this figure. One interesting thing to note; the helmet (unlike the picture) covers the eyebrows, so he looks much less stern with it on.</div><div><br></div><h4>Torso</h4><div>The shirt is the best part in my opinion. It has a very realistic duty belt, unlike most LEGO police officers, and the badge looks just like the CHP's. I can see it being used for a number of law&nbsp;enforcement&nbsp;uniforms.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Rest...</h4><div>The legs are plain, boring black, but he does come with a traffic ticket and handcuffs (from what I've seen, every pack comes with 2 pairs). The handcuffs also show the worst in the Chinese produced LEGO. The color is off and the plastic is a different texture. The ticket, on the other hand, is very neat. It has legible text that says ""Highway Patrol Speeding Ticket"".</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, I would highly recommend this minifigure. I only marked it down a star because of the poor quality.</div>",TRUE,4,5,1,5,3

"Firox_5000","2010-09-25T18:22:06.833Z","Iam giving you a ticket to buy","<p>I bought this at argos during a 3 for 2 offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure is one of 16 in the series 2 minifigure collection. He has 7 pieces and he is easy to build. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The traffic cop contains a ticket with neat printing,handcuffs. The chest hasa cop badge and walkie talkie printed on but the legs are a dull black. the face has glasses printed which is a nice addition and has a old fashion cap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I would would say he is one of the medium figures not the best not the worst. However if youre unlucky to get 2 or more of these which I have 5 you cant really do much with all of them. but alone it is a good set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3

"United_Bricks","2011-09-04T13:19:15.937Z","Better than the city cops","This cop I would say is better than the city poilce because of its cool torso. I mange to pick up two of them. The minifigure comes in a blue packet which you can't see inside so you don't know what you are getting. <br>The helmet of the cop is a black poilce biker helmet. His head has black sunglasses printed on. His torso is awesome with brown hands and a badge and radio. He has two pockets printed on his torso. His legs are just plain black, I would of liked it if their had been red line on both sides of his legs. He come with a 1x2 sand coloured plate which is meant to be a ticket. The ticket is very detailed with a badge at the top and the first part of the ticket says Highway Patrol Speeding Ticket, then the rest goes into scribbles. The final part is the cuffs which are not rare they are light grey.<br>Overall better than the city poilce.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,4
"TheFadedTBCap","2011-04-03T16:54:12.07Z","Pretty Cool Cop!","<p>This is a great minifigure and it is one of my favorites from series 2!&nbsp; It comes with a pair of handcuffs and a very detailed&nbsp;speeding ticket.&nbsp; The face has a cool pair of sunglasses, but I wished he had a new, different hat.&nbsp; However, his hat does look good so I should not complain.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Comes with two handcuffs (one extra) and a very detailed speeding ticket</li>
    <li>Cool, adventurous face</li>
    <li>The Traffic Cop&nbsp;has great playability and can be played as an adventurer or even a badguy or whatever you want!</li>

    <li>None!</li>

"clundsberg","2011-04-30T13:36:47.473Z","You'll never catch me flat-foot! nyaaaa!","<p>This is the first minifigure my son received thanks to Santa.&nbsp; These little guys are a blast to collect if you can find them.</p>
<p>My son really enjoys the mystery aspect to the characters and the bios found here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://minifigures.lego.com/en-us/Bios/Default.aspx"">http://minifigures.lego.com/en-us/Bios/Default.aspx</a></p>
<p>We actually went through all of them for all 4 series yesterday.</p>
<p>He also enjoys putting the figures together sans instructions.&nbsp; It's a very simple build but it still gives him pleasure and I'm sure a sense of accomplishment.&nbsp; The enclosed checklist is a great idea that seems to have gone the way of old Star Wars and GIJoe figures.&nbsp; It's not a difficult thing to include in packaging and it's great to know what is available. GO LEGO!</p>
<p>This copper comes with a helmet and handcuffs which most police line figures do, BUT he also comes with a traffic ticket!&nbsp; No more can Lego figures get away without a physical reminder of being busted.&nbsp; I guess it's a good thing Lego currency consists&nbsp;solely of&nbsp;gold coins, rare gems&nbsp;and $100 bills! (I kinda wish I had this currency)</p>
<p>Whenever I look at set lists for minifigures, there are a few that seem kind of ho-hum and&nbsp;maybe not so original to me in concept.&nbsp; I thought this way initially about the traffic cop and a few others, but my tune has changed, for even the figures that seemingly come with many sets (such as police) are tweeked enough in paint-scheme, accessory or facial attitude to make them stand out in their work environment.&nbsp; I no longer think there are any mundane mini-figs and it's great just to be able to finally find these guys.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
"sideswinger","2020-07-30T20:00:05.783Z","A neat figure!","<p>So the sixth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2 is the Traffic Cop, and I know a lot of people really dislike him. But what do I think? Well let&#39;s take a closer look.</p>

<p>So on top we have that helmet piece, which isn&#39;t anything too special. It&#39;s not a piece that&#39;s hard to get or exciting at all. It does fit though, however boring it may be. And it&#39;s caste in a solid black, which I don&#39;t think is a rare color or anything like that.</p>

<p>Then we have his face, which is a pretty neat face. I love how relaxed he looks. But I will say that it looks like any other generic LEGO City sunglass face. Still, it looks neat. No back facial printing either.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso printing, which does look cool. I love the badge, as well as his walkie-talkie, and his belt looks good too. I just think it looks cool, and is pretty useful as well.</p>

<p>And his legs are just plain black with no printing, so let&#39;s move onto his accessories, which I think are great. First he has those handcuffs, which they aren&#39;t anything too special, but of course, they do fit the figure very nicely. But his other accessory is this 1x2 tile, which is my favorite part of the figure. And for some reason it isn&#39;t shown in the picture, so if you&#39;re thinking about paying him I would check it out, but it&#39;s an excellent piece. It has some writing on it, which I think is actually literate, so that&#39;s awesome. It&#39;s just an awesome piece.</p>

<p>Overall, my opinion is that I do like this figure, mostly for that 1x2 tile. The rest of him does look sort of like your everyday LEGO City cop, but I&#39;m okay with that. I just don&#39;t know why, but I like this figure, and I know a lot of people won&#39;t agree with that. But that&#39;s okay, because it is their opinion, as this is mine. If you&#39;re thinking about buying him, I would recommend doing that, mostly just because of that 1x2, but before you buy it, I would check out some other reviews. And I think that wraps up this review, so check out my other Series 1 and 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
