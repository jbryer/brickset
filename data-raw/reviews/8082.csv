"J__B_","2010-08-27T20:09:54.383Z","Memories...","This minifig is very reminiscent of Dr. Kilroy, from Adventurers. To me, that's the #1 reason to own this guy. Now we just need a King Leo... PLEASE LEGO? PLEEEASE?<br><br>The bioniculars are a good addition. That, along with the white hat, give the minifig a good ""explorer"" look.<br><br>Oh, and that MAGNIFYING GLASS---just awesome. It really works--it's fun to look into it, right at the minifigs head.<br><br>Bottom line--Not as good as the Pharoh or Spartan, but a very good addition to Series 2.<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"tyuku57","2010-08-28T13:31:43.647Z","jungle hacker","<p>In my opinion the jungle explorer is the second best minifigure you can get (the spartan).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hat is the best minifigure hat (next to spartan helmet) and is the same as indiana jonses dads hat but a different colour and his magnafine glass really works,binoculars are awsome and two come with him so there is a spare. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike most minifigures his legs are patterned and his torso too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>overall this is a good minifigure and i hope this review helped</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"TheFadedTBCap","2010-10-30T20:28:41.31Z","Awesome Adventurer!","<p>This minifigure is awesome!&nbsp; Explorer is the the best minifigure in series 2!&nbsp; He comes with very cool pieces and his shorts can make other minifigures like your own adventurer or Steve Irwin.&nbsp; I enjoy playing with him all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many ways to play with him</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comes with cool body, legs, head with monical, magnifying glass, cool hat, a stand, and two binoculars</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Magnifying glass really works</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you bed the legs the is still color</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non</p>

"Firox_5000","2010-09-25T17:48:53.077Z","good old school figure","<p>I bought this figure during a 3 for 2 offer at argos. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This figure is one of&nbsp; 16 figures released in the series 2. It comes with 6 pieces and is easy to build. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The explorer figure is really nice he includes a magnifying glass,binoculars and explorer hat. He may not have any actual new or unique pieces but he is very good in another way. The figure&nbsp; is very similar to dr kilroy and sam sinister as seen in the adventurers theme. He has an old school style&nbsp; and looks likea figure&nbsp; you&nbsp;might expect to find in the 90's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>overall he is a Pretty good figure and I suggest you try hard and find him or buy him on ebay.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
