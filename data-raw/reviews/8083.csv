She even bring her own buoy (is that the correct term for this item?), just like Pamela did.<br><br>Nothing special about this minifig, except that she wears a one piece red swimsuit. Quite unique. I think the other minifigs that ever came close is the Paradisa figs. But this fig still better than them. <br><br>The only minor problem for this minifig is the printing. This minifig is suppose to be a minifig that wearing a one-piece swimsuit, right?

From feeling the packet I thought she was the Spartan - huge disappointment when I opened it up.<br><br><h4>Building Experience:</h4>It's a minifigure, can't expect too much.<br><br><h4>Parts:</h4>Like
all
of the Collectable Minifigures the face is brand new. The hair is wonderful and the black
stand is quite useful. The problem I have is the same as the Surfer - the leg printing just doesn't go back far enough.<br><br><h4>Playability:</h4>Not fantastic, but then none of these minifigures are. They're really more for display purposes.<br><br><h4>Value for Money:</h4>I
paid
AUD$3 for this Minifigure and it was 20% off. A bit of a letdown to find the Life Guard in the pack but my City was seriously lacking female residents anyway.<br><br><h4>Overall:</h4>Great to finally have a female minifigure but not exactly what I was hoping to find in the pack. Hours of fun, maybe.",TRUE,4,5,2,3,5
"Odeinoichus","2016-09-25T01:16:15.08Z","Some People Stand in the Shadows...","<p><strong>Set #8684 Life Guard: </strong>This particular Minifigure was on my short list of must own figures, in spite of many others coming out this particular one hasn&#39;t been seen again so I was thrilled to find it at very long last, last year.</p>

<p>The Life Guard is dressed in a red one piece swimsuit that is obviously inspired by one of the hottest prime time shows of the 90&#39;s. Her print is single-sided and features the initials G.T. The life preserver piece was introduced with her and it looks great, we&#39;ve only seen it twice in total as of this date from what I&#39;ve seen, I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s been included in any other sets. The same can not be said of her blonde hair piece with the long ponytail at the end, it&#39;s been used numerous times by now, and it is a fairly decent hair piece. Her simple facial expression is also quite nice for a CMF with visible lipstick.</p>

<p>Overall the Life Guard, in my opinion, was one of the best Minifigures from Series 2, and while others definitely outshone her in certain areas she is still a must own figure. I am very pleased to have been able to add her to my collection and I wholeheartedly recommend her.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-07-31T22:41:53.427Z","An okay figure!","<p>So the eighth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2 is the Lifeguard, and she&#39;s a figure I used to despise. But what do I think now? Well let&#39;s get a closer look.</p>

<p>On top we have that big pony tail piece, which isn&#39;t anything too special.&nbsp;It is caste in that spring yellow, which wasn&#39;t new or anything, and it isn&#39;t a rare color or anything either. I don&#39;t mind that too much though.</p>

<p>Next we have her face which to me, looks a bit odd. That smirk just looks a little awkward, and her raised eyebrows just look weird too. I don&#39;t know, just the&nbsp;hole thing looks off to me. No alternate face either, which is common for 2010.</p>

<p>Then we have her torso, which is pretty cool, I guess. I like those curve lines, as well as the little life saver logo on her bottom corner, and if you look closely you can see the letters &quot;G.T&quot; in the top left corner of her shirt. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a reference or something, but nonetheless. She also has yellow flesh printed on there, and if you look at some other online images, you&#39;ll see that it looks a little odd. This is because light colors printed on darker ones don&#39;t mix well, which we see here. It&#39;s a common mistake in LEGO, but oh well. No back torso printing either.</p>

<p>Then we have her legs, which do have a bit of printing on them, with that red swimsuit design. Nothing too exciting, but at least LEGO put in the effort to print them at all.</p>

<p>And finally, we have her accessory, which is pretty cool. It is a red flotation&nbsp;board which is very great and also very fitting. It was new for the figure as well, which is just awesome. Overall, it&#39;s a nice piece.</p>

<p>And the figure as a whole is beginning to grow on me. However, with that being said, she still isn&#39;t one of my favorites. She&#39;s in the lower middle tier for me, and might still be one of my leas favorites from Series 2. On the bright side, she&#39;s a lot better than the awful Series 12 Life Guard. But don&#39;t even get me started on him. And I think that wraps up this review! So check out my other Series 1 and 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
