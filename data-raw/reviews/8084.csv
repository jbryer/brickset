"MetroiD","2010-09-20T10:26:30.017Z","3 Heads and even 1 Beret - for that extra bit of chick blas√©.","In short, the Mime is probably the best value for money you'd get with Series 2 Collectable Minifigs.<br><br>And by saying that, I guess it's obvious that I don't bear a grudge against mimes in general. Or find the cheaper plastic THAT appalling - I mean, come on, even old minifigures can get pretty damaged if you mishandle them, so assuming that you take ""proper"" care when storing / handling your minifigs, the probability of them spontaneously breaking apart or melting down and ending up as a puddle of ABS is pretty low.<br><br>Back to the topic at hand - there's a good reason why the mime is indeed great value for money, and it's the simple fact that he comes with a beret (!) AND three different faces. Mind you, that is ""faces"", as in minifig head pieces - and not alternative facial expression prints that have somehow ended up on the back of some poor minifig's head (don't you just hate it when they do that?).<br><br>A mime minifig can be put to good use in a ton of situations, including but not limited to: livening up your town besides a statue in the local park; performing at the arts centre; messing with pedestrians on one of the main streets; acting as a frozen trespasser in someone's castle... And if you've got no love for mimes whatsoever, you can still use the (great!) pieces for custom minifigs - the legs may not be printed, but the torso print would be a welcome addition to the wardrobe of any delinquent. As to the beret - well, it's finally a proper new hat by LEGO, and it's something that quite a few of your minifigs would probably crave.<br><br>All in all, a great little minifig. With three heads. And a beret. How could you NOT love it!?",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

"AETerry","2011-04-11T16:18:25.66Z","Mime Time Review","<p>The Mime's a fairly decent and cool looking minifigure from Series 2. Appearance wise I do like him far better then the Clown from Series 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of accessories like other minifigures, he's got three heads to exchange out with of Happy, Sad and Frightened. The torse print is great too with the black and white striping for a traditional looking Mime and black beret. </p>

"sideswinger","2020-08-02T00:45:06.367Z","A pretty great figure!","<p>So the ninth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2 is the Mime. This figure was released in 2010, he retailed for two dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that hat piece, which does look awesome. I don&#39;t think it was new for the figure, but I could be wrong about that, since I&#39;m awful at knowing when pieces were first produced. It&#39;s still a neat part though to get in a two dollar figure.</p>

<p>And then we have his face print, or prints. I normally take a look at accessories last, but since his accessories are alternate faces, I&#39;ll just look at them now. First we have that smiling face, which I do really like. I just love how chipper he looks there, and I guess you could use it outside the figure, though the usability would be limited. He also has that really scared expression, where he has that grimace, as well as the wrinkles beside his eyes. And finally, his third face looks sort of sad, with that big frown. Overall, they are some nice prints.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso and arms, and his torso has some excellent printing on them. I love the black jacket, with those buttons, and his shirt underneath has some incredible black and white lines. No back printing, which is normal for 2010. But his arms is where the magic happens. They just look great, with those black and white lines, and they could be used outside the figure as well. But the cool thing is, this dude is the first LEGO CMF to have arm printing. That&#39;s just great, because arm printing has been a huge thing in the world of CMF&#39;s, so that&#39;s just really neat.</p>

<p>And since his legs are plain black with no printing, and since I already reviewed his accessories, let&#39;s talk about my overall opinion of this guy. And overall, I would say he&#39;s a pretty awesome figure, and he&#39;s one who&#39;s definitely growing on me. I just love his printing, with that first appearance of side arm printing in a CMF, and he&#39;s also just a great choice. However, I do think the extra heads are a little strange. I mean I know they couldn&#39;t of done alternate facial printing with that hat and all, but I kind of wish they just would&#39;ve given him another accessory and left him with only one face, because the extra heads just do not work for me. I think it&#39;s pretty good value though, for only two dollars. And that&#39;s it for this review! So check out my other Series 1 and 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
