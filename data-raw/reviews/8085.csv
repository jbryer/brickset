He includes the same hair as appeared with The Magician in the last series, quite a nice head with a very determined expression and some definite signs of strain on his face, similar to that of some of the miners from the Power Miners sets, but he also has sweat running down his forehead which while it is a nice touch for this figure does limit the possibilities of using the piece for other minifigures. The torso is printed with some of sort of lime green&nbsp;and black sleeveless gym clothing, with a belt around the waist&nbsp;and some smaller details. The weight is made up of three parts, two weight pieces and a bar the same length as The Magician's wand and the laser from The Spaceman's gun. I see the fact is made up of three peices as an advantage because you could replace that small bar with a longer one and make a two handed weight. The legs are split into shorts and shoes, similar to the explorer which are also lime green, the same colour as the torso.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Figure - </strong>This figure is not particularly good for either display or play, but that weight could almost certainly find other uses and so could be wanted in multiples. I also wonder if they could have improved it with some muscle definition on his torso like that on The Wrestler from Series One.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall - </strong>This figure has earnt a 6/10 but I can't see much real use for it sadly. I do however like the weight pieces and may get a second of this figure just for them!</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4
"A_Brickset_user","2010-09-20T22:57:09.98Z","Strain on the muscles, but not the wallet!","Collectable minis... perhaps the greatest invention since the LEGO brick itself! Thanks to brickset's excellent barcode sheet, I picked this up at a Wisconsin TRU. <br><br>Building Experience: Snap, snap, snap. Finished before you can say ""barbell"". <br><br><br>Parts: This particular minifigure's expression stands out to me as comical. In a physics (and cartoon) sense, this is one of the most realistic minifigures in the new series. The strenuous weight of the barbell is clearly seen in the mini's facial expression. The barbell is nicely made out of a short lightsaber rod (think magician's wand or spaceman's laser from series one) and two new molds representing the weights. The torso and legs are made in a nice shade of green, though the skin tone of the yellow minifigure unfortunately mixed with the green printing while being manufactured. The result? Visibly cheaper plastic.<br><br><br>Playability: Not much, more of a collector's item.<br><br><br>Value for money: If this isn't worth $1.99, then I don't know what is.<br><br><br>Final words: Pick this up if you're a completionist, otherwise, you'd do well to pass it.<br>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When finished you get a weightlifter minifig. The figure has a cool weightlifting piece as well as a printed vest on the chest and slightly strange trousers on hsi legs. His face has a kind of strengh fighting face and a sleek black hair piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp; figure can lift the weight up and down as many times as he likes. This figure would go well in a lego city gym setting , street scene or any lego city set really. </p>

<p>This is a figure I recomend and I would say out of the best and worst figures in series 2 he is probably around the middle.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,3

"Odeinoichus","2016-09-25T00:55:29.37Z","The World's Strongest Man!","<p><strong>Set #8684 Weightlifter:</strong> Last year a re-seller had some older Minifigures at a local convention and I was fortunate enough to find two Series 2 Minifigures, I missed these when they first came around and I certainly wish I hadn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The Weightlifter has a nicely detailed torso with a great looking print for his jumpsuit or exercise suit, the print carries down to his legs and we get to see he&#39;s wearing shorts and green shoes. This was before dual molding, so the legs rely on multiple printing colours to show his yellow ankles. His facial print is nicely detailed as well with a sweating, straining expression as he works to keep the weights in the air. His accessory consists of a small bar piece with two unique new pieces made to represent the weights on either end of the barbell he&#39;s lifting, this was a nice addition to the existing parts catalog and we haven&#39;t seen it re-used too often from what I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>Overall, I like this minifigure, he&#39;s a nice addition to my collection and features some simple detailing that was the norm back during Series 1 &amp; 2 of CMF. I&#39;d recommend tracking this one down if you don&#39;t already own one.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-08-02T01:36:54.597Z","An alright figure!","<p>So the tenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2 is the Weightlifter. He was released in 2010, retailed for two dollars, and included seven pieces. And let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that black hair, which is commonly called &quot;wig boy&quot;, and it&#39;s not a rare piece or anything, so nothing too special there. It does sort of fit the figure though to me, so all good there.</p>

<p>Then we have his face, which looks pretty great to me. I really love his angry expression, with that angry mouth, and I love the sweat drips on him. It&#39;s just a great face that I think could be used outside the setting. And no alternate face, which is common for two buck figures.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso printing, which looks pretty cool. I love the big black belt, as well as the yellow flesh showing, and It can&#39;t really be used outside the figure, but maybe you could use it for something. No back torso printing either, which is also normal for 2010.</p>

<p>Then we have his legs, which do have some pretty good printing. I like the back lines, and the yellow flesh looks good. He even has some side leg printing, which is very uncommon for 2010 CMF&#39;s. Just some neat legs overall.</p>

<p>And finally, we have his accessory, which is just that weight. It is made upof three pieces, and the two identical parts were new for the figure, which is awesome. And I do think that they look pretty neat.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this figure is okay. I like how they gave him those new weight parts, and I also love his face; it&#39;s probably my favorite part of him. I think the Series 17 weight guy is better, but this dude still does look pretty cool. I think he&#39;s sort of a niche choice, but the new weight pieces make it up for me. And I think that wraps up this review! So check out my other Series 1 and 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
