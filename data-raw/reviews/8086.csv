The hair is, I think, a new piece as it is different to the hair used at least on the old Hermione Granger figure from the Harry Potter sets. The colour is certainly new, a kind of&nbsp;strawberry blonde or ginger. Her head has some&nbsp;pink mascara&nbsp;on it above her&nbsp;eyes and her mouth is open as if she is singing. Her torso has a pink sparkly sleeveless top on it with some cleavage lines like many of the newer female figures, there is some yellow skin showing at the bottom of her torso which is&nbsp;nice detail, as&nbsp;are the necklaces she is wearing. She includes two microphones which have black handles and silver tops, there is even a tiny part sticking out from the base of the handle which could have a wire leading from it.The legs are bright pink and have some buckle details on them, there is also some printing on the hip piece which is quite a rarity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Figure - </strong>This figure is great for display but the possibilties are limited for her on playability, maybe she would go nicely in the new Lego City helicopter and limousine (which I do not not own). This minifigure could be useful for making women and the microphone piece is very nice but has not got many&nbsp;uses so I would say this may be wanted in multiples, but only two or three at most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall - </strong>I give this figure 7/10 mainly for the microphone piece. However this figure has few uses except for display, which is why I did not give the figure an 8.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,4

"absolutelylez","2010-08-28T19:56:03.76Z","A brightly coloured and unique figure to add to your collection.","<p>Let's start from the top..<br />
<br />
New hair piece! With new colour and new design, the hair appears to really flow, and it makes the girl look very pretty. It has however a massive disadvantage; you cannot move your minifigure's head around. The piece is so big that it clings tightly to the back of the torso, meaning that your minifigure MUST look forward to not have its face concealed by the hair. The pose in the above photo is NOT possible.<br />
<br />
The face is a fun design. The girl has pink eyeshadow and an open mouth, I assume she's always singing. The lips are very full and very red, much darker than in the picture above.<br />
<br />
The torso is excellently designed. It is almost entirely shiny-silver with a good detailed design for the female torso, using as many curves as possible to distract you from the otherwise very blocky torso piece. <br />
<br />
The trousers are really well designed and printed. A bright pink, they make your minifig really stand out among the rest. There is a sweet buckle design down each leg.<br />
<br />
The obviously cool piece is the microphone - the set comes with one spare, which I think is great as it can be given to either Disco Stu or to your Emo skater from Series 1 - Emopunk, anyone?</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She certianly is bright and colorful with pink and silver printing for her torso and legs. I believe that hair mold/design is new and it looks great. I got two microphones in the bag I got, so there's an extra piece to work with.</p>

<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>~ All new elements

<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>~ The hair piece can only be positioned in one place so you can't move the head to either side</li></ul>

"JCE","2011-01-31T22:12:58.553Z","Gorgeous!! Oops, they did it again!","<p></p><p>She is definitely one of my favorite minifigs from the first 3 series. I like that she stands out in a display. Her colors are very unique in a minifig. Not even Paradisa had pink and fushia clothes! And the paint job of the outfit is outstanding. The silver ""sequins"" are a nice touch, and genuinely look silver.</p><p><br></p><p>Her hair mold is all new and quite pretty! The color is also unique-- kind of a very light brown.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm also in love with her face. Her eyelashes are fuller than othe female minifigs and the eyeshadow really glams her up. Both the eyeshadow and lipstick color are fuchsia, closer to her pants color than what's shown in the official Lego image.</p><p><br></p><p>She's a great, unique minifig, and constantly garners the attention of anyone looking at my display.&nbsp;</p><p></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-08T09:29:30.51Z","LEGO Collectable Minifigures (Series 2) - Pop Star Review","This minifig has been my first minifigure of series 2. It's a really useful minifig to have, because we get the new microphone with this set. When I first looked at the pop singer she reminded me a little bit of Hannah Montana, because of the clothes. This figure is one of the BEST minifigs of series 2 so far.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,5
"sideswinger","2020-08-02T15:28:01.827Z","One of the best!","<p>So the eleventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2 is the Pop Star, and she&#39;s a decent figure to me. She was released in 2010, retailed for two bucks, and includes 5 pieces. So let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that wavy hairpiece, and I have always been a huge fan of that piece. It just fits lots of different female fig&#39;s, and I love the moulding all around it too. I want to say it was new for the figure, but I&#39;m probably wrong about that, so don&#39;t quote me on it. And I&#39;m pretty sure this is the most common color for it, so nothing rare. But it is still pretty cool.</p>

<p>Then we have her face, which also has&nbsp;pretty cool printing. I love the makeup around her eyes, and I also love that singing expression. Singing faces didn&#39;t appear too&nbsp;much back in the day, but in recent years we&#39;ve got a decent amount. Still, this is a nice face. No alternate face printing either, which was common for most non-licensed minifigure series&#39;.</p>

<p>Next we have her torso, which looks pretty great. It&#39;s some pretty complex printing for 2010. I love how she has all those individual metallic dots, as well as her shiny necklace. I just think it&#39;s a good print. No back torso printing, which was common for the first few series&#39;.</p>

<p>Then we have her legs, which do have some pretty cool printing. I like that belt&nbsp;which looks pretty neat, and I do also like those buckles on her legs. I just really like that printing overall.</p>

<p>And finally, we have the best piece in the figure: the microphone. It&#39;s just a brilliant piece overall, with the handle where minifigs can hold it. And it is hard to tell whether it&#39;s dual-moulded or printed. I would guess printed since they didn&#39;t have much dual-moulding back then, but who knows. Either way, the top is that metallic silver color, which looks awesome and is very fitting, and the bottom is caste in black, which is nice. And this was the first appearance of that piece as well, which makes it even cooler. It&#39;s appeared in several sets like LEGO Friends, Trolls, some other CMF&#39;s, and loads of others as well. They give you an extra mic too, which is very generous.</p>

<p>Overall, I know this is a figure that a lot of people weren&#39;t real big fans of, but I personally really like her. I love her hairpiece, but the microphone is what steals the show to me. And two mics in a two dollar figure with the rest of the figure as well is a pretty sweet deal to me. And I think that wraps up this figure! So check out my other Series 1 and 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
