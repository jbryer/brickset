"J0rgen","2010-08-07T07:26:11.44Z","Let's hit the slopes!","I got this figure a couple of weeks ago, along with the rest of series 2. This is definitely one of the best figures, not only does it have proper skis, it's capable of holding both skis in one hand! The skis are great for both cross-country and downhill skiing&nbsp; as well as skijumping. The new hat is great, not as ""crooked"" as the old one. Overall a great minifigure, with some brilliant accessories! Even my brother, who doesn't like LEGOs, loved this figure(he does love skiing though).",FALSE,5,5,5,5,4
"capnrex","2010-08-07T14:12:48.44Z","The Skier","<p><strong>The Parts - </strong>The parts in this minifigure are fantastic, there is&nbsp;a great&nbsp;selection, the best&nbsp;of any figure so far, Series One or Two. I will start with the hat which is really nicely designed, it is a deep blue (as are most of the parts in this figure). It has a well molded turned up brim which looks very realistic, there are also some nice fold lines on the back of the hat which really add to the look of it. The head is quite plain, it has a grin, orange tinted sunglasses (or skiing goggles maybe) and brown eyebrows. The torso is very well detailed with a white zip going down from the neck,&nbsp;which then dissapears behind a white athletics vest with has the number 211, above that there is a small motif. The arms are a slightly lighter shade of blue than the rest of the torso, he is also&nbsp;wearing some nice red gloves, which look&nbsp;nice&nbsp;against the shades of blue and white. The ski poles are very nice,&nbsp;and they fit together to be held by the skier in one hand. The legs are plain blue with&nbsp;a&nbsp;light blue stripe across each leg. The skis themselves are&nbsp;lovely with slightly curved up ends on them, just like real skis! The skis also fit together to be held in one hand like the ski poles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Figure - </strong>The figure is possibly the best in the entire series for display (along with the Spartan, the Mexican&nbsp;and the Vampire) and the playability is also wonderful with the opportunity to have races with them if you bought more than one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall - </strong>I cannot find fault with this figure and so am giving it 10/10, it is simply fantastic and surprisingly one of my definite favourites from either series.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"duilim","2010-09-22T05:33:35.42Z","Better than the Spartan??","This minifig could quite easily be the best of the series, unfortunately for it (but fortunately for us), Lego came out with something special in the Spartan, and so, it takes second place in Series 2.<br><br>There some really nice accessories here - I love what Lego have done with the skis and the ski poles - very realistic in it's design and the overall color scheme is aesthetically pleasing. Many of you may not agree, but a part of me actually prefers this minifig over the Spartan!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"TheFadedTBCap","2010-10-30T20:43:09.75Z","Skiing to Awesomeness!","<p>This minifigure is great!&nbsp; The skis and ski poles are wonderful and well designed.&nbsp; Definitely 2nd best minifigure (behind explorer) in series 2!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really fun to play with</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comes with improved skis, ski poles, awesome ski hat, and stand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neat face with orange glasses</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can hold skis and ski poles in his hands at once</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard to put the ski poles in his hand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a while you get the hang of putting the ski poles in his hands, so the con is not that big of a deal.&nbsp; I enjoy this minifigure very much and I give it a 10/10!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"gime","2011-01-16T19:57:27.767Z","another great minifig from S2","<p>I've bought this one to complete my collection.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Standard bag with barcodes, so it's pretty easy to pick the right one.<br>Standard Minifigures folded instruction.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I like the customized skis and sticks. Hat is good too.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>He seems to be a pro-skier taking part in some kind of competition as he wears a starting number. Design and colors are great. Head-piece is also good but with that forced smile he looks a bit dumb.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's a bit tricky to make him hold skis and sticks at the same time.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Looks awesome. No quality problems.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Very good example from Minifigures S2. Excellent for collectors to put on a display but probably less usable in real play.</p><p>Here is a picture of this guy:</p><p>[img]http://gime.vot.pl/gime/8684_skier.jpg[/img]</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"sideswinger","2020-08-03T02:52:22.91Z","AWESOME PIECES, bland figure!","<p>The twelth figure in the LEGO Minifigure Series 2 is the Skier, and he&#39;s a figure who&#39;s pretty great to me. He was released in 2010, retailed for two dollars, and includes eight pieces. But let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that hat piece, which has always been a neat piece to me overall. It looks good&nbsp;with all those ruffles in the back, and it is caste in blue as well. The best part is that it was new for the figure, which is amazing, considering the other--well we&#39;ll get to that later. But as a whole, the piece is great.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which looks pretty good. Nothing too special, but I do like his orange glasses. Nothing else to say about it, since it is pretty generic. No alternate face, which is common for most CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, which also looks pretty good. I like the three black numbers, as well as the zipper behind that white over shirt, and it is pretty cool that his arms are a different tone of blue than his body. It just adds an extra level of detail. No back printing either, which is normal for older CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Then we have his legs, which have a wee bit of printing on them, with those light blue lines. His waist section is a different color than the rest of him besides his arms, which is cool. I mean I like how they gave him leg printing at all, but there&#39;s a problem. See, the bottom of his torso has that white shirt continuing onto his legs, but the problem is that the shirt does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;continue, so it looks pretty strange. If they at least made the waist white, it could have made things better, but it isn&#39;t so...yeah. Sort of strange.</p>

<p>But the accessories is where the magic happens. They include two brand-new ski pieces for the figure. That is stinking amazing. And those pieces are amazing too, with those poles, as well as the ski&#39;s themselves. They are just awesome parts. And they&#39;ve been used in loads of sets, like in Series 8, some&nbsp;LEGO Friends sets, some LEGO City, some Creator, and even some parts that have nothing to do with snow, like the Hogwarts Great Hall and Whomping Willow. They&#39;re just amazing parts.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s sort of what I think about this figure. He includes some amazing parts. The hat, the poles, the skis, they&#39;re all new for this dude. And he retailed for only two dollars, which is an awesome price for those three parts. However, while those pieces are very great, the actual figure himself is a little bland. It&#39;s just not too great, with sort of boring printing. And that wraps up this review! So check out my other Series 1 and 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
