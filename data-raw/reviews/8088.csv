The hair is probably the best part, it is the same piece as the red wig on The Clown from Series 1 and it suits this figure very well. The head is quite nice with a cheesy smile which has&nbsp;a tiny little sparkle in the corner, he also has dark glasses and black eyebrows. His&nbsp;jacket is open at the top showing some chest hair and a large medallion necklace which is&nbsp;a really nice design He has a purple collar, purple arms, pockets and some little buttons as well. The item he is holding is a record, possibly a vinyl which says 'Brick Fever' on it with a disco ball in the background and some decoration around the edge. His legs are completely plain, I think it would have been a nice idea to put some lines on the trousers&nbsp;to make them look flaired, but you can't have it all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Figure </strong>- The figure is quite good for display and for playing with as it would be easy to make a sort of mixing desk for him to use!&nbsp;This figure could be desired more than once for the hair but beyond that I can see&nbsp;no reason to buy more than one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall - </strong>I give this figure 7/10 overall as although it has no new molds like most of the Collectable Minifigures, all of the prints on the parts are outstanding, which is enough alone to earn this at least a six, the hair however adds another point and bumps my mark up to a good solid seven!</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In continuation of my Series 2 collectible minifigure reviews (check out my profile for more!), I finally get to be thrown back in time to unveil the DYNOMITE minifig known as the Disco Dude. Back in 2010 - when I first started collecting the theme after sadly missing Series 1 &ndash; Disco Dude immediately stuck out of the crowd of faces on the polybag with his unique hair and humorous leisure suit. I realize John Travolta was not known for having an afro (his partner in Pulp Fiction did, though!)&nbsp; but I can&rsquo;t stop thinking of&nbsp;<span data-term=""goog_1505969364"" tabindex=""0"">Saturday</span>&nbsp;Night Fever when pulling Disco Dude out onto the brick floor.</p>

<h3>Polybag and Instructions</h3>

<p>This series&rsquo; polybag has a pretty light blue colour that&rsquo;s very attractive to the eye, unlike some of the other series polybags which (in my humble opinion) had truly ghastly colors (I&rsquo;m looking at you Series 4!) Right under our beloved LEGO logo - and the silver &amp; red lettering announcing&nbsp;<em>Minifigures!</em>&nbsp;- we&rsquo;re introduced to LEGO&rsquo;s choice picks seeking our attention and gleeful curiosity. Sadly, Disco Dude ended up entirely absent (FYI: Check out my review of Mariachi Guy we&#39;re got front billing).</p>

<p>Something which I really love about the polybag - that may be overlooked (just noticing it now) - is the question marks aligning with the top rim of the bag, signaling that our beloved bags are a random grab bag &ndash; so if you didn&rsquo;t already know, you&rsquo;re in for a surprise (and possibly some duplicates). So, be prepared,&nbsp;<em>you never know</em>&nbsp;<em>what you&rsquo;re gonna get</em>(unless, of course, you have magic fingers and a lot of time on your hands to feel up the bags). Beyond the little preview, piece count, and a warning, there isn&rsquo;t more than that to polybags.</p>

<p>One thing about the warning, which cautions that contents present a choking hazard, is that Series 2 did not feature it as prominently as the current polybags due. The accessories are most definitely small, as the basic minifig pieces aren&rsquo;t terribly large, I can only assume that the black square base plate has had some unfortunate incidents and therefore requires more caution for families of small children when handling the contents.</p>

<p>The instructions sheet is the very brief, as you would expect from a set that only consists of a lone minifigure, so there&rsquo;s not much to say. On the first side of the instruction sheet, we are shown how to a build minifigure for those who don&rsquo;t already know, along with column list of body parts and accessories from Series 2. On the reverse side we have a simple checklist showing all the minifigures of the series -which I personally found helpful before discovering Brickset.Com.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>For the most part the build of this minifigure is easy - like any other minifig &ndash;&nbsp;and am thankful it&rsquo;s a much less finger-intensive construction than was with Mariachi Guy (that darn poncho!).</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p><strong>Helmet/Hair</strong>: Finally, after being teased with it in the 1999 Lego Racers video game - you could have the 1Up character don a &lsquo;fro, but there was no real world equivalent- the first afro piece was finally released officially. (I suppose you could say that the Clown from Series 1 had an afro, but that&rsquo;s really stretching it &ndash; don&rsquo;t you think?) LEGO spared no expense on Disco Dude&rsquo;s hair; the mold is solid shiny piece of black plastic with numerous bumps to simulate the tight curls and gravity-defying height of the real hairstyle. The hair sits low on the head, until just above the eyebrows and clearly covering the &ldquo;ears&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Head</strong>: This is another great head from the collectible series and is one I personally adore. Disco Due has black arched eyebrows, one a little higher than the other to compliment his toothy, smirking grin. Decked out with magically &lsquo;levitating&rsquo; purple shades (matches the suit) with silver frames, Disco Dude shows off with his awesome smile that makes you think that under those glasses his giving you a wink. As a special treat, LEGO included a small sparkle to a tooth, completing the party-going-good-time-guy that we concluded was the intention of Disco Dude.</p>

<p><strong>Torso</strong>: The Disco Dude was spared no expense in his quest for having the rare colour purple (actually two shades of purple) embellishing his white leisure suit at the arms, collar, pockets and waist. Add to this, some gold buttons, a huge gold chain necklace and circular pendant, and some &ldquo;hair&rdquo; for his chest &ndash; we definitely get one of the more unique (non-fantasy/Sci-Fi) torsos. I noticed that the hands are a slightly different yellow that others, perhaps because this minifigure had pieces made in China.</p>

<p><strong>Legs</strong>: Simple plain white legs, not much to say, these are a necessary piece for a minifig&rsquo;s wardrobe.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong>: Disco Dude comes is completed with a printed blue flat square (I suppose this is what is known as an LP&hellip;a vinyl record) with white dots framing a disco ball and the words:&nbsp; &ldquo;Brick Fever.&rdquo; Now I know where I began to think of<span data-term=""goog_1505969365"" tabindex=""0"">Saturday</span>&nbsp;Night Fever.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Like all collectable minifigures, the playability of one is limited to your imagination, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t get your kitsch on for some unobvious fun. Think of the adventure of pairing the Evil Pharaoh with a legion of LEGO vampires, mummies, and witches that can only be defeated by the Power of Disco! Can you sing &ldquo;Staying Alive?&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Suggested Pairings</h3>

<p>If you have any of LEGO&rsquo;s 1970&rsquo;s or earlier sets, than you&rsquo;re in luck to have a &lsquo;man of the times&rsquo; (and I&rsquo;m sincerely envious of your collection) but most of us are going to not have an easy time paring Disco Dude in settings that don&rsquo;t make him appear stylishly dated. So that may be what he&rsquo;s best suited for &ndash; a bit of old time whimsy. (And since I&rsquo;m just a teen, Disco Dude is&hellip;like what my grandparents were in their twenties). If you have a setup for a roller rink, a dance club, festival, or even trick-or-treating neighborhood parades &ndash; Disco Dude adds some amusement and fun.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Back when Borders was in business, I picked-up Disco Dude from a very crafty feel-up of polybags (how could you miss that hair!). Sadly, the bookstore is no longer around but I got what turned out to be my most favorite minifigure. Perhaps LEGO can be nudged into doing a&nbsp;<span data-term=""goog_1505969366"" tabindex=""0"">Saturday</span>&nbsp;Night Fever themed-set; or maybe That &lsquo;70&rsquo;s Show. 5 out of 5 stars&nbsp;</p>

"sideswinger","2020-08-03T16:55:51.06Z","A pretty neat figure!","<p>So the thirteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2 is the Disco Dude, and he&#39;s always been one of my favorites of the series, however he&#39;s not as good as I once thought.&nbsp;He was released in 2010, retailed for two dollars, and includes 5 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that afro, which is the best part of the figure. I&#39;ve always really loved that part, with all its extremely complex moulding, which is very advanced for its time. It is caste in black as well, which was a new color for the figure. I just really love how the piece came out.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which has some very nice printing. I love that cocky expression, with that flashy smile, and his purple sunglasses look great as well. It&#39;s just an awesome face print to me. No alternate face, which is common for most CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, which is also pretty interesting. I love the 80s look, with the purple collar and purple pockets, and the necklace looks a little odd, but I don&#39;t mind a bit. I also like how he has those purple arms and all. No back torso printing, which is common for the first few series&#39;.</p>

<p>And since his legs are plain white without any printing, let&#39;s talk about his accessory, which is that 2x2 tile with the &quot;Brick Fever&quot; printed on it. I do really like how that came out, and it could totally be used outside the setting as well.</p>

<p>Overall, this was a figure that I was a huge fan of. I used to adore this dude. Now, he&#39;s just okay. I do still like how he came out, with that great hair-piece, but when you compare him to his gender swap counterpart from Series 13, this guy seems pretty drab. But as a whole, my rating of him would still be a four, because he is still upper middle tier for me. And I think that wraps up this review! So check out my other Series 1 and 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
