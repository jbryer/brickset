I will begin with the hair which is the same as that&nbsp;on The Vampire. It also appeared on Count Dooku and Chancellor Palpatine so is not a new piece (however it has never appeared in black). The face looks very similar to that of&nbsp;The Spaceman from Series One with black eyebrows, a cheeky grin and some cheek lines. His torso is mainly white with some stitching around&nbsp;the neckline, he also has a small symbol on his chest and many crease and fold lines. He also has a black belt which continues down across his hips and onto his legs. He is holding a golden trophy which is in the shape of a minifigure which is a lovely piece, a nice surprise is that&nbsp;two of this trophy come in the set, one as a spare I&nbsp;imagine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Figure&nbsp;</strong>- The playability for this figure is excellent as you could definetely&nbsp;set up&nbsp;a fight if you had two or more of the figure, so I think it is certainly worth buying more than one. This figure is very good for display as it could be&nbsp;put in&nbsp;many&nbsp;cool karate poses&nbsp;which would look very striking on a shelf with your other minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall -</strong> I have to give this figure an 8/10. I knock off two marks for the fact that the figure is quite boring alone and I think the face could have been more interesting, but it is still a fantastic minifigure!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"Firox_5000","2010-09-13T16:40:24.907Z","Master Karate man!","<p>When found in the series 2 bag he comes with 6 pieces and is extremly easy to asemble. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ninja guy has a cool detailed hair piece as well as robe like chest and torso. His face has a concentrated look. The character also includes a Mini golden figure trophy which is neat and alone makes this figure one try and worth getting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This figure goes well with the ninja theme,a lego gym setting and Lego olympic setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this figure is also compatable with the series 1 ninja. You could make him be his master or even face off against him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for a karate master try and find him while you can!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,3

He comes, of course, with a black base.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Mini-Figure is nice. He has a martial art suit, with an award/badge/etc on it. His belt Is tied above his waist but continues down to his non-existent knees. He has a cheesy grin, as if he's posing for a camera, and nice big eye-brows, His hair is new I believe, and I join with the other Reviewers in saying it should be used more often</div><div><br></div><div>The Statue is where it really comes to light for me, you get <i>two</i>&nbsp;in the set so one can go with the Karate guy on his stand, and the other in a MOC. I've used it in museums, as a Egyptian treasure (works rather well), and as something for my Blacktron 2 sets to take from the Space Police. (it's always niggled me how blacktron are 'thieves', but never have anything to steal)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,3

<p>Pros : a rare minifig</p>
<p>Cons :&nbsp;Did they have to be in grab bags?</p>

"AETerry","2010-10-17T20:16:53.46Z","Everybody was Kung Fu fighting!","<p>This is an awesome little figure. And there's a lot you can do with him from facing off against a Ninja, to being in a Dojo and Olympic scenes with him. I love the hair piece, would love to see more of this type show up in more sets (Joker for green, Agents 2.0 River Heist for another green) and the Vampire figure have this hair piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More can clearly be done with this for future set possibilities, not just as a minifigure collectible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In defense of the Lego Trophy accessory piece, I'll say it looks smaller due to a close up of the minifigure and the angle at which the trophy is held, creates the illusion that it's bigger then it really is.</p>",TRUE,4,2,2,4,4
"alva","2011-03-23T06:59:01.54Z","Great Costume but Really Bad Hair","What I love about this set is the golden trophy. I can think a lot of use for this statue. You can use it as an Oscard award MOC, or a small human for microfig scale MOC, or a doll for little minifig, or a decorating elements from a building.... Really lot of possibilities.<br><br>Regarding the minifigs, I like the suit. I think this karate suit is quite cool and I am thinking that I can create a Ryu (from the Street Fighter game) minifig using this torso.<br><br>What I don't like about this minifig is the hair and the facial expression. The hair is really ugly. I mean, what kind of guy brush his hair like this minifig do? Very oldies and untrendy:P<br>And the face? I think to many wrinkles around his face, making him look old. <br>",TRUE,3,4,2,2,3
"JCE","2011-01-31T23:24:36.737Z","Kee-YAH! Cool concept.","<p></p><p>I generally go for the more colorful minifigs, but was still happy to get him. The karate outfit is rad and the trophies and the trophies are cute, even though I didn't need 2. (Or 2 more if you get Series 3 Sumo.)</p><p><br></p><p>I would have liked the face more if not for the jaw lines or the furrowed brow lines (which make him look like he has a unibrow.) The hair, as far as I know, is a new mold, even though I have no idea why they chose this style. Why is it so... angular? Ah well, it's unique.</p><p><br></p><p>I would have loved to see him come with a wooden plank that he could break.</p><p></p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"sideswinger","2020-08-04T16:23:23.68Z","A pretty good figure!","<p>So the Karate Master is the fourteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2, and he&#39;s a pretty decent figure. He was released in 2010, retailed for two dollars, and includes 5 pieces, not counting the extra trophy. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting him off, we have that hairpiece which is commonly called the &quot;Widows Peak&quot; hair. And while the piece itself wasn&#39;t new for the series, I previously learned that the coloring was new. It wasn&#39;t exclusive to this figure, as it came with the Vampire in this series, but it was exclusive for the series, which is cool. The piece does fit the figure for me as well.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which has some cool printing overall. I like his eyebrows, as well as his big smile. Those cheekbones look good as well. And I think the print could be used outside the setting. No alternate facial printing, which was normal for most CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Then we also have his torso, which has some pretty neat printing. I love his big black belt, as well as that logo in the top right corner, and the yellow flesh looks great as well. No alternate torso printing, which is common for earlier CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>And then we have his legs, which have a little bit of printing on them. I like the two black lines on his middle piece, and I love how they continue onto the other two parts of the legs. I just do really like how the belt straps continue from the torso through the legs. That&#39;s just really neat to me.</p>

<p>And last but not least, as have that golden trophy, which was new for the figure. And it is an incredible piece, with all that moulding accurate to a minifigure. And it looks awesome in gold as well. The piece has been used in several other sets as well, like some Civil War, Avengers Endgame, Series 4, just lots and lots of sets. They give you an extra art with the figure too, which is great.</p>

<p>And my overall opinion is that this is a pretty good figure. While the printing is decent, the hair and trophy parts are awesome. And for two dollars, I think it&#39;s worth it for those two parts alone. And I think that wraps up this review! So check out my other Series 1 and 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
