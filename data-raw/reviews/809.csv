The huge cockpit pod thingy... for just one minifig? And what's with the banks of controls behind the pilot? Doesn't sound very handy to me. The flyer is pretty cool, but I think too large for the base unit really. The arms are a bit short, but those wider hinge plates work far better than the smaller ones (as in 2153), which quickly lose the ability to hold their own weight. As for play value, the problem is the set just doesn't balance well, despite the pretty huge area of the two feet combined. Admittedly first time building I got confused and built part of the hips backwards, but even after I corrected that it didn't take to much to tip it over. Even given the awesomeness of trans neon green helmets with black visors, the price you're inevitably going to have to pay for this just isn't worth it.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

I like all the pieces, would make a nice parts pack, my favourite feature is the little ship that can dock on the back. reminds me af a mini star hawk II. Also, Allen Shizard, How could this set be &quot;more detailed&quot; if you arent comparing it to anything or something like that?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The trans green cockpit is usefull for my building different blacktron 2 sets, but overall the set is sort of ugly.  THe good about this set would be the peices, the figures, and the mini ship.  THe litle ship is my favorite part and is well put together.  THe peices can be used for near anything which is a great help at that.  so, over all, i think that this set could have been put together better, and with some more moving parts.  Other than that, the set is great for kids and model builders that are looking for a decent peice selection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It looks like it would be great for exploring distant planets if it was a real robot. Its a shame they don't make things like this anymore.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
