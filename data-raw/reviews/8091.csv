I looked in the sky and thought ""I have absoloutley got to get that!"". It has the same hat as Tutankhamun (ha ha ha, get it? Toot and come in?) Oh, jokes.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"capnrex","2010-08-07T17:42:40.07Z","The Pharaoh","<p><strong>The Parts -</strong> The parts&nbsp;for this&nbsp;figure are some of the best of any&nbsp;in Series Two. It includes, firstly, the Pharaoh headgear, which is fantastically decorated with blue stripes and some very detailed molding on the back. This piece is not new as it appeared in the old Adventurers sets I believe, on the forehead of the headress&nbsp;is a stud which could have something attached to it if you so wish. The face has blue markings above the eyes like real Pharaohs had in Egyptian times, it also has a rather serious looking mouth and some cheek lines. The torso is highly detailed with a huge necklace or breastplate which has many little gems and gold decorations on it. Towards the bottom of the torso is part of an Egyptian loincloth which is continued onto the hips and legs like on The Judoka, there is also some decor on this part which is predominantly white with hints of dark blue and gold. The Pharaoh carries a wonderfully elegant golden staff with a cobra twisted around the top end of it. The rest of the staff is made up of crossed lines which look like some rope has been coiled around it almost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Figure -</strong> This minifigure is&nbsp;brilliant for play or display&nbsp;as it has so much detail but is also a lot of fun. I can definetely see many reasons for buying more than one of this figure, but the main reason has got to be for the parts!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall - </strong>I want to give this figure a ten, but I can't as I feel it lacks something in the way of sandals, I think with some tiny stripes on the feet to look like sandals, this would certainly be faultless, but as it is, it only gets 9/10. Still an amazing figure though!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"Carl","2010-12-25T19:56:39.467Z","Pharaoh","The Pharaoh is a very cool LEGO minifig. He has a rare Pharaoh gold headpiece and a new gold snake-scepter. The snake-scepter is an awesome new piece and goes extremely well with any Egyptian theme. His building experience and playability respectively are lacking a little due to the fact that he is only a minfig. I rated value for money 5/5 just because I got series 1 and 2 for Christmas, thus getting this guy for free. Overall, the Pharaoh is a great addition to everyone's collection, and I would recommend him to all.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,3,3,5

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure is part one of 16 figures in series 2. He has 6 pieces and is very easy to build. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Phorah is one of the best figures in series 2 behind only the Vampire and roman spartan. he incldes a cool golden staff pole which has good detail. he also has a pharoah head piece which is very well designed with gold and blue and has printed torso and chest. </p>

<p>He goes very well with adventurers theme and anything related to ancient egypt and even indiana jones.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3

<p>&nbsp;Pros: detail , staff , headress</p>

"Nesquik","2011-04-12T09:35:53.48Z","Egyptian King","A fantastic minifigure with plenty of details and a beautiful accessory (his gold staff) to match. I always enjoyed the original adventures of Johnny Thunder back in 1999/2000 with his Egyptology quest, and this product brings the memories back.<div><br></div><div>While many minifigures these days are bombarded with detail, its often hard to distinguish what theme they belong in and this, to me, alters their playability. The great thing about minifigures that belong to historical themes however is that, when their is detail, it is always distinctive and can easily represent what era that chap/gal belongs too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This Pharaoh is a prime example; his robes are clear, his headdress is beautifully formed and his staff is so obviously an item of luxury.</div><div><br></div><div>Whilst I've always preferred LEGO's City minifigure designs from the 80's and 90's, their historical efforts have actually just got better over time. I really hope they continue to introduce such minifigures as they look wonderful! I would love to see a Caesar, although we do already have the&nbsp;Gladiator.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"AETerry","2011-05-28T11:17:27.6Z","Pharaoh Review","<p>I think I'm left feeling alittle meh with this figure after getting him off ebay from a reseller and discovering that the legs are ""loose"" and not stiff as is often the case with brandnew minifigures. Meaning that the mini bends over and legs move just a bit too freely w/o much resistance, a possible indication of less then steller quality on this particular figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you can't win them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detail wise, this minifigure wins out with the print job for the torso and legs showing the style of wear for the Egyptian nobility. The face is decent for showing the khol make-up around the eyes. The pearl gold headress while done before (in other colors) with the Adventurers theme and more recently with the Pharoah's Quest theme looks awesome. I also like the pearl gold serpent staff the mini holds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is a good looking minifigure, I got him to be a villian for my Batman Theme, ala King Tut. And while I have some mummy minifigures with Egyptian headdresses, none of them had the right look that this minifigure does.</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,4
"SeptimusHeap","2011-02-12T08:57:24.277Z","Great Fig","<p>I got this great minifigure along with the Witch and Magician. It's a great little fig, and I was glad to get it. I marked the building experience as a 1, but it doesn't affect my overall picture of the set, because it is small, and it was the most enjoyable build a small set like this could have.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Amazing new printed body, legs, and face.</li>
    <li>Great golden head piece.</li>
    <li>Very well molded and detailed scepter.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Chinese plastic (Lower quality)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tips For Finding</h4>
<p>There are a few easy ways to find the Pharaoh, first, feel for the scepter. It has a distinct shape and texture. Second, feel for the head piece, it too has a distinct shape. Feel for the inlet for the stud on the fig's head.</p>
<p>I think this guy is right up there with the Spartan and Samurai for best collectible fig. If you find him, get him right away!</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,4,4
"tkettle9719","2012-01-12T15:39:34.517Z","Behold Tut, A Ruler among Minifigs!","<p>I got this set at Borders before they closed down, and think that this is a nice minifigure, but it isn't the best.<br></p>

<ul><li>-The detailing and color is outstanding.<br></li><li>-Pharaoh pieces are very nice.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The face is very odd-looking.</li><li>-The legs are also weird, as there is a yellow spot on the top.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a nice minifigure, and one I'm glad I got. I highly recommend this set to all adventurers (even if you took an arrow to the knee), Indiana Jones fans, and real archeologists.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"sideswinger","2020-08-06T20:49:00.803Z","An okay figure!","<p>So the sixteenth and final figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 2 is the Pharaoh, and he&#39;s a decent figure. He was released in 2010, retailed for two dollars, and includes 5 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that headdress piece, which is a nice part. It wasn&#39;t new for the figure, but it is a nice piece overall. I love the printing on it, with the blue lines, and the coloring is great too, with that gold design. It does have a stud on top too, though there isn&#39;t anything that goes onto it.</p>

<p>And next we have his face, which has some okay printing. It does look a little bleak, but still it&#39;s not terrible. I do like the mouth, as well as the cheekbones, and the eyes have those nice lines and all. No alternate face printing either, which is common for most CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has some pretty good printing. I like his necklace, as well as the white line on the bottom, and no back torso printing, which there isn&#39;t any back printing for ay figures in Series 1 or 2, so that&#39;s kind of unfortunate.</p>

<p>Then we have his legs, which do have some pretty good printing overall. I love his waist printing, with that gold line, and he has some great printing on the actual legs themselves, which looks pretty complex. He has some nice side legs too, which is just white printing on the upper half. It does look odd since it isn&#39;t dual-moulded in the back, but oh well.</p>

<p>And finally, we have his accessory, which is just that serpent staff. And I really love the piece overall, with that excellent moulding, which looks top-notch. I love the snake at the top, and also the moulding on the handle part of it. And I don&#39;t know if the part was new for the figure or not, but nonetheless, it&#39;s still a great part.</p>

<p>And overall, this figure is a great one, and you get some awesome pieces for a two dollar figure, like the hat and staff. However, Pharaohs are pretty common in the world of LEGO, and we even got the &quot;Pharaohs Quest&quot; theme that same year. But still, this is a decent figure. And that&#39;s it for this review! So check out my Series 1 and 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
