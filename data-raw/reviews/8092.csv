"legoguy2805","2010-07-30T12:01:04.37Z","Is what the set name says.","<p>I got my 3D glasses free with the January 2010 Lego Magazine, to be used to read the 3D comic inside and when playing&nbsp;the '3D ATLANTIS online games'.</p>
<p>The glasses are quite tearable because all of it is cardboard apart from the lenses, which appear to be made out of some kind of plastic, so they can be ripped and bent easily.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Can use them to play 3D games or read 3D comics</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Made of cardboard so can rip/bend quite easily</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, a good set for free.</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,2,5

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-03-31T15:34:42.653Z","Are you trying to tell me THIS is LEGO?!","<p>A small review today for a very small... thing.&nbsp;I found these in a old LEGO Magazine in my grandparents&#39; house three months ago.</p>

<p>BOX/INSTRUCTIONS<br />
A piece of plastic wrap. These things are one part, so no instructions...</p>

<p>PARTS<br />
One set of cheap cardboard 3-D glasses. For the magazine, I guess they work... but the quality is excruciatingly poor.</p>

<p>PLAYABILITY<br />
You read the Atlantis comic in the magazine with them. For a throw-in magazine gift, it&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t expect it to last more than a week undamaged.</p>

<p>PRICE<br />
Free with a free magazine. Can&#39;t fault &#39;em there.</p>

<p>OPINION<br />
Meh... cheap 3-D glasses produced by LEGO. If you see it on eBay don&#39;t bother. Boring junk.</p>
