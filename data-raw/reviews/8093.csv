It comes in a plastic bag and you can only get it, if you are member of the LEGO-club. It is given away for free on the LEGO-roadshows. Since it is not achievable everywhere its collectability is relatively high. One special are the painted-on sidebags of the trousers.<br></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pro's:</p><ul><li><p>free</p></li><li><p>rare item</p></li><li><p>nice trousers</p></li></ul><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Con's:</span></p><ul><li><p>none</p></li></ul><p>If you can get one, don't wait!</p><ul><li><h4><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></h4><br></li></ul>",TRUE,4,1,1,3,5
"Dino_Boys","2010-12-10T14:25:28.333Z","Great Minifig!","<p>I got this minifig at a LEGO Club meeting I went to in Jan or Fed 2010. He is great!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<li><strong><em>Pros:</em></strong> Great figure! 
<li>Pants, which, on the side of each leg, are printed pockets! Sweet! 
<li>Hair that you can't get ANYWHERE else! (Actually, in Collectible Minifigures Series 1, 2, and 4, but those are in different colors). 
<li>Rare! 
<li>Free! (Except for the participation fee. But I&nbsp;believe they are given away free elsewhere.) 
<li>
<li><strong><em>Cons:</em></strong> NONE!</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another peculiar thing I found with him, he seems to go perfectly with every theme: Power Miners, Star Wars, even Indiana Jones!</p>
<p>Overall, he is my favorite minifigures, and I'd say: If you have the chance to get him, GET HIM!</p>

"Ernst","2012-03-12T17:26:44.057Z","Mister LEGO ","<p>Overall 5 bricks : I normally don't review minifigures like the CMF's but I make an exception for Max. Simply because I see Max as Mister LEGO and I consider myself lucky to have him since he never officially was for sale. A very cool minifigure with great torso and smile. If you can get your hands on it, a must have for the true LEGO collector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 1 brick : no building needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : The 5 bricks are for all parts but most for the unique torso with the Capital Orange M and the unique tan legs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability&nbsp;2 bricks : no playing options, but I use Max often as occupant when I have built a Creator house. So&nbsp;2 bricks for Max for granted services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : I got it for free when I bought The King's Castle from a specialized web shop. When I got it at first I didn't know the value of the little guy but now I treasure it. Several for sale on Bricklink for â‚¬7,50 so if you are a&nbsp;fan I advise to buy it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,2,5
"Red_Five2","2016-12-15T20:15:04.863Z","Max","<p>The &#39;Max&#39; minifigure&nbsp;is very rare. It comes with four pieces. His hair is brown. He has a wide smile with some weird eyes. His torso says the &#39;M&#39; logo for &#39;Max&#39;. The legs ate pretty normal except it has some pocket&#39;s.</p>
