<h4>Box</h4><p>I would have made this a smaller box, otherwise there is a lot of wasted space for the size of this kit. It does great to depict the LEGO theme and that it is for a birthday. Flipping it over you get a clear listing and pictures of everything that comes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>You have enough minifigure party favors, invitations and thank you cards for 10 kids. So make sure you've got enough and who all will be coming. As the Host, there is a large Birthday Card you can have guests sign for your child and a LEGO Birthday Magnet.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Birthday Minifigures all have a new brown wavy hair that's only been seen on a few other minifigures such as a skate boarder from the CM line and Ron Weasley in the 2011 Harry Potter sets. They've got a white torso with a ""slice of cake"" print on them and red legs.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>At $40, that's a bit expensive, but then so is any birthday party planning. But if I compare these specialty Birthday Minifigures to the Collectible Minifigure series, it does start to even out. $3 for a minifigure and there's 10 of them. That's $30 right there in value. A well done folding sheet that's a quick cheat sheet of many basic LEGO techniques that also has a LEGO Graph Paper on the back for designing sets and an Official LEGO Builder Card that all the kids get to have. The card is very well done; made with sturdy plastic, a place on the back for the child to sign their name and it looks very official. Judging by the children's reactions, these little minifigures were a hit and everyone was happy to receive one.</p><p>Granted with some ingenuity, we got the rest of the birthday done to a LEGO theme and it went over very well and was successful.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,5
