The only problems are pretty minor-the head should be able to move down, up, right, and left. It can only go up and down. Of course, this makes sense, lego couldn't do it at a scale this small. The second problem is that the legs don't really stay in place, depending on the position. They won't really stay in the position you want them to.&nbsp;The&nbsp;pic of its larger cousin, released in 2010 also, is what I used as a basis fror the position of the legs. Its hard to keep them even, but it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>Overall, the problems don't really matter, and it would actually be better displayed than played with.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,5
