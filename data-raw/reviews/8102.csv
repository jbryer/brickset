"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T20:49:35.303Z","Informative and Fun","<p>Standing Small is a bonus title which is included with The LEGO Book in a slipcover, the two books together make up a fount of knowledge that fans of LEGO may not have already been aware of, this title involves all information concerning the LEGO Mini-Figure, from the early days to the present. It includes photos of just about every different type of Mini-Figure there is, from the time of printing. I can't be sure if anything is missing from this book in that regard, after all there are quite a number of Mini-Figures... I suppose the only thing that could possibly be added to this might have been all of the animals which some consider extensions of the Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as reading material goes I think it's worth the price of admission for both titles. And it allows you to see some cool fan-made Mini-Figures as well selected to be showcased in the last few pages of the book. As a reference guide I'd say this title is pretty good actually, and as a conversation piece it gives you a lot to talk about with your fellow LEGO enthusiasts. If you're looking for some good reading material concerning the LEGO Mini-Figure then this book is definitely for you.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-02-07T19:07:03.363Z","Great Book","This book as another user mentioned is packaged in with the LEGO Book. I am going to say this- I love this book. It showcases the many amazing minifigures LEGO has made, from the original Police Minifigure to Solid Gold 3P0.&nbsp;It also showcases some neat custom minifigures- like a US dress marine to a PacMan fan to the author of the book (Nevin Martell).&nbsp;<div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>There were a few errors in this book, however- for instance, it shows a castle knight as being made in 19923, and it listed a flesh Dumbledore as being made in 2001. However the faults can be forgiven.</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Overall this book is great, it gives a lot of information, and it's really just super cool. I recommend getting it!</div>",FALSE,5,1,1,1,5
