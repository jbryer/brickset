"majorgeneral","2010-10-23T13:44:57.337Z","Wanted...Got...Free","<p>Not mutch to say really. I got it free. Good Minifigure (Will go nicely with my winter village)&nbsp;,good selection of parts (shocked me to get an airplane window), lots of extra bits (More extras), a new Prop and a good design.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"Nesquik","2011-07-28T15:45:16.03Z","Mega-Microlight","Having the opportunity to pick up these 'petrol packets' (my phrase, as they they're usually available from gas and service stations) can be a great opportunity to stock up on some quirky builds. These unique sets - just like those from 'The Mirror' newspaper offer - are distinct from their large plastic bags and 5 digit product numbers.<div><br></div><div>In this case, 30012 'Microlight' is a fun take on the miniaturisation of popular City themes. We've seen tiny Fire trucks, compact Doctors cars, and now your favourite minifigure can fly in a simple but effective Microlight. The construction itself is a no brainer and doesn't require a great level of delicacy, which is important for little fingers in the back of a car!</div><div><br></div><div>Although I would suggest that other 'petrol packets' have a greater level of authenticity within the City theme, the Microlight is perhaps more difficult to associate with. Its features are bland, with the engine details relied on by two SNOT components to make the build look more effective, whilst the red grill bricks on each wing have little relevance to how the Microlight would actually operate. Never the less, it aids the imagination.</div><div><br></div><div>There are a number of highlights - two of which are the 'concave' (rounded) 2 x 2 plates on the base of the aircraft that allow it to move smoothly on a flat surface, and this itself is backed up by the classic horizontal 'bar' brick that hooks can attach to, thus meaning that this Microlight could be towed by a vehicle.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As for the minifigure, he sports a simple two-coloured torso that took me right back to the 1980's town people (lovely primary colours) with white detailing that suggests he loves traveling and adventures. The pants and helmet are blue, while his face has an expression of concentration. I expect he's happy whizzing around in this craft, but at the same time he is completely engrossed in the activity!</div><div><br></div><div>A nice set on all accounts, and only makes me wish that LEGO would revive the pocket value 'Leisure' theme that was so wonderful during the 1990's (search set 6517 as a nice example).</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,5

My 4 year old got this and 7239 and 8402 for his birthday and has played with them all constantly. Looking forward to getting more City Lego soon.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
