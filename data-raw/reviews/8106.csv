"bluelion3","2011-07-11T10:15:33.897Z","Cute, nice, but falls apart","I got this set because it was only USD $4 or $5 and I like little vehicles.&nbsp; It's not a very realistic vehicle, but it looked fun enough.&nbsp; I thought it would be a simple little vehicle for me and my 2 year old son to play with.&nbsp; He likes it fine, but there are some issues.&nbsp; The minifigure's hat is very loose and will fall off.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; If you try to remove the minifigure from the vehicle by his head, you'll just pull off the hat.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; While playing, the curved bar with lights will fall off the back.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; It doesn't connect strongly enough so that you can move the car by holding the bar, which is a shame because it sticks up and it seems natural to use it like that.&nbsp; We just leave the curved bar and lights off.&nbsp; <br><br>Other than that, it's cute and fun to vroom-vroom around.&nbsp; And it taught my son the word ""walkie-talkie"".&nbsp; I would recommend set 7736 ""Coast Guard Quad Bike"" instead, which is a way cooler vehicle.&nbsp; I built it by collecting parts from Bricklink, but so far I have not added the flag in the back (and I assume it might fall off during play).&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,3,3,4,3,3
"AETerry","2013-01-29T13:30:39.66Z","Police Buggy Review","<p>Price wise at $3.99 for a set, this is pretty good. Especially as 2010 and 2011 saw me wanting to update and expand my Police collection for my LEGO City/Town.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The set comes in a polybag, meaning a plastic bag. Which can be good, sometimes once in a great while, I find I need to be careful as these bags can tear a little too easily on the store shelf or rack. And they might already be open by design or accident. So make sure everything is present.<br><br>Instructions consist of a folded sheet of paper with clear, easy to follow step-by-step illustrations and a listing of all of the pieces included in this set. It's fairly standard and nothing too out of the ordinary.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>At 34 pieces, this is very close to a good deal for the price. Including some extra pieces, like light or transparent pieces. <br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Police Minifigure you get in this set isn't bad either. New police uniform and print that looks far better than my older 80's &amp; 90's police minifugres. Personally I love the white cap he's got.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model<br></h4>All together, you've got a decent and quick build for a police buggy. It's not too complex of a build, not for it's size. There are a few other sets from over the years that are very similar to this set.
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all, this is the type of set you get because it's either impulse and you want that ""quick LEGO fix"" for a new set, you're wanting the parts or looking to expand on, supplement and build up a Police force for a LEGO City. They're perfect stocking stuffers, birthday gifts, holiday and any occasion. <br></p><p>It's also the type of set, that if you're not into City/Town or Police, you can skip this set and focus on other themes from LEGO that do hold your interest. And the style of build, if you miss it one year, another similar model is likely to come out at some point.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,5
"fikko3107","2012-12-11T11:45:43.877Z","A thoroughly So-So set...","This is the first time I tried the Pros and Cons review template, see how it works out. I got this set earlier this year when my dad went to Hong Kong. It seems that from what I've read, The availability of this set is fairly common, making this a not-so-rare polybag. Oh well, so much for having an exclusive set...&nbsp;
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Well designed,not great, but good enough for little children.<br></li><li>The Buggy's shape really gives a rugged look</li><li>For a small set, there are many interesting elements.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Unlike 2011 policemen, this particular copper lacks back printing...<br></li><li>the back juts out way too much., thanks to the Walkie-Talkie</li><li>The vehicle is terribly disproportionate to the Minifigure.<br></li></ul>
<p>Honestly, I don't usually review this short but this is just an exception since I want to see how it turn out. So, in retrospect, I guess it is fair to give this set a 5/10, since the Pros balance the Cons, it's not bad, but it's not good either.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,2

"Brickcreator","2012-10-14T17:11:43.08Z","Nice Set, but odd design...","<br><br>I found this set at Target last Easter for 50% off, so I ended up buying 2 of them for $1.99 each. The minifigure is quite nice, except it has a baseball cap instead of the conventional police cap. This makes him seem kind of like an outcast compared to other policeman figs. The buggy itself is quite sparse with only the bare essentials. It has wider wheels than most other buggies and just looks a little too big for the minifigure. The five lights and the yellow steering wheel are a plus, but don't make up for the bad design. Despite its bad design, it is great to play with. Since it is bigger than other buggies, when rolled, it doesn't tip as easily. This is great for little children. If you are thinking of a little set for a stocking stuffer, or other small gift, this is perfect. The build is simple and straight forward.&nbsp;For pieces, the value is horrible. But if you're a little kid who is just getting into LEGO, this is great.&nbsp;So, would I buy this set again? Probably not. But at 50% off, who can't buy a LEGO set? :)<br><br>",TRUE,3,2,4,4,3
