So as a gift, it was a fun little toy to get as part of the stocking and stuff to play with and look at while me and my daughter waited for the Grandparents to come out and join us for the morning celebrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got another seasonal set build that's Santa in his sled being pulled by a reigndeer, so concept wise, this idea has been done before. But I have to say between the far older set and this newer one, I like the newer one best. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reigndeer uses brown bricks in the build and looks like it's actually harnessed to the sled. I like the face of this santa over the older one I have. And the presents are more apparent to what they are. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a fun set to put together, I let my daughter play with it and then after words, like many other sets of this type, I put them up for display and show.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4
