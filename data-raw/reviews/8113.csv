A small paper container included the chocolate sweet and a variety of such small polybags, which usually included animals, birds, fishes or transport.</p>

<p>This particular set contains a few basic bricks, one with a pair of eyes to create different creatures, such as <em>a penguin, a duck, a fish</em> or anybody else.&nbsp;The polybag&nbsp;itself doesn&#39;t present anything peculiar and is intended for a fast build and play with possible combining with other similar creatures or major Lego sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below is a small picture of how such Milky&nbsp;Way chests looked like back in 1990s (thanks for the picture to <a href=""https://youtu.be/Gl1RpylLY6U"">this video review</a>)</p>
