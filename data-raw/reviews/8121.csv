It can be purchased in Hungary for 4999 Ft (about 15 $ or 24 L), so this is a cheap set of nice LEGOs. There are 4 minifigs in the box and a packet of good items for building some like-like situations. Recommended.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"starboykb","2012-06-10T08:54:01.96Z","Nice set for City starter","<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">I rated this full value of money
because I got a great promotion price at TRU during the opening in
Brunei. This set is easy to build and definitely good for new City
collector starter like me. I really love the tow tuck and hopefully
able to get both City Garage and Garage 2009 soonist.</p>
