<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it was a bit too advanced for her as once it was done, she wasn't really interested in playing with it and handed it back to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which.... that's okay, perhaps in another couple years she'll have changed her mind. In the mean time, I found this set rather enjoyable and fun to put together, having pieces for a fireplace, stocking, tree and presents. Something new that I don't have pieces for were the flat tile pieces that look like cards or envelopes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this little set needs were just a couple minifigures enjoying the scene, something easilly fixed from the box full of minifigures that I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, this is just a lovely and beautiful little set and one that works easilly as something to build and place around for display at christmas time.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,5
