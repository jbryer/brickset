"Legocityfanatic","2011-01-12T20:17:31.807Z","Classic Halloween symbol!","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>I&nbsp;decided to review this small Halloween themed set. I bought this along with 40013 Halloween Ghost. Building this set wasn't extraordinary, or fun, just plain old snapping pieces together. You could just buy the parts from the Lego store as they aren't rare, or varied, just ones included in almost every other Lego set. There is absolutely no playability other than flying it around making kid-airplane sounds. On the brighter side the price is good. Overall, buy this set if you're looking for a cheap Halloween decoration. I'm not usually this type of reviewer but this set isn't like City or Star wars sets, it's not exciting!",FALSE,3,2,3,1,5

"AETerry","2013-03-04T13:39:43.86Z","Halloween Bat Review","<p>Technically, I never bought this set, I missed seeing it in stores and at the time, I'd been looking at other sets for my collection.</p><p>I printed out a set of instructions and went through my parts bin wanting to put this together for my Halloween Display and then putting together more kits from my parts bin as a party favor and activity build for my daughter's Birthday Party.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>Having printed out the instructions from a pdf file, I find it all fits on one page and has fairly easy to follow step-by-step illustrated pictures for each stage of building. There is also LEGO's listing of parts that are included for this set.<br></p>
<h4>Parts <br></h4><p>Overall, the parts are fairly easy to find and order from LEGO if you missed out on picking up the polybag set and wanted something to display for Halloween. It's only 25 pieces and it will go together rather quickly.<br></p><h4>Build and Completed Model</h4><p>Using a bunch of fairly common pieces, the set makes for an easy and quick build. I had a couple of problems from kids at the party not experienced with building, but everyone succeeded, even with a little help from other kids and present adults.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>For my daughter's Birthday Party that we did as LEGO themed, this set and kit I put together from all of spare parts in the parts bins, it was an absolute hit and the kids all enjoyed making these and having something to take home.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,4,2,4
