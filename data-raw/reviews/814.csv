"A_Brickset_user","2003-07-07T00:00:00Z","","I didn't like this set too much, but I got it and another Aquaraiders set (Aguadozer, 2161) because my Aqausharks were losing pitifully in all battles to my Aquanauts, and they needed back up. Now, I think of it as Blacktron 2 took to the seas and lent a hand to the Sharks. Those minifig's torsoes (both of those two sets) are very useful.
Owen, thank you for the compliment from 2167. Why doesn't Tab work on this review, or any for that matter?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The drills are really cool, not to mention the saw in the backcompartment.  The aquaraiders only had three sets but this set was the heart even though it was the smallest.  I think that anyone who is reading this reveiw should definetely get it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Color theme is great looking Trans Yellow/Green/Black 
Stickers are worth putting on
Good price
2 trans yellow canopies
Cool minifig

Cons:
Availability
Rear canopy isn't a complete seal

If you want a cool aquanauts set that is light on the pocketbook, get this one

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is notable because I never actually bought the two Aquaraiders sets, they belonged to my brother up until we merged our LEGO Collection together and then eventually I inherited the whole thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Crystal Scavenger is a really great and powerful looking submarine. The model is built out of black and green pieces with transparent green and a few plates with printed details of controls, mechanisms and such. It was also a fairly large vehicle, not as big as some of the current submersibles, but a solid and good looking vehicle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure was great too. I believe he was the leader of the Aquaraiders, or at least I always considered him to be because of his hook hand. This set included one of the elusive energy crystals and a container to put it in built into the submarine. The arms on the craft were able to rotate, but they were more like tool arms than manipulator arms, the pilot would have to get out to pick up the energy crystals that he discovered. But that isn't exactly a bad thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had endless hours of fun with this submarine, and overall I'd have to say that it is definitely a good set to pick up. One other fact, although this set only included one Mini-Figure it had a cockpit section for that figure and another section where you could put a second Mini-Figure from one of the other Aquaraider ships. Or store some of the Aquaraiders tools for the job. (and since most of these sets included extra chromed spears or daggers they definitely needed a place to be stored.)</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
