<p>This set is pretty much one of those statue sets you would get for a holiday or season, but it&#39;s so simplistic you&#39;d be doubtful to even call it that. There really isn&#39;t a lot&nbsp;you can do with nine parts to be fair, though even for the time it&#39;s a bit uninspired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if i&#39;m sounding a bit negative, I personally collecting little sets like this. Though this is not the best kit of it&#39;s kind you could get, that should be obvious, for what it&#39;s worth it&#39;s not terrible. It&#39;s perfect if you want a cheap few parts to put together, probably even better for a younger kid too.</p>

<p>Getting your hands on it is another thing entirely. If you were to just buy the parts, that would be incredibly cheap and easy. Getting the actual kit, sealed or loose, is pretty difficult but not impossible. Yet again why would you want this set? (Unless you&#39;re me of course.)</p>

<p>Overall; not terrible, not terrific, just relatively interesting at best.</p>

<p>May your mice be basic.</p>
