The ship is large, and at the price it goes for ($15 isn't bad) it is a great buy. No it is not lame, it has a purpose, it works, includes some good parts, and is actually pretty cool. The main cockpit opens and releases a small buggy-like pod with a propellor (con #1- the pod has trouble fitting in if the propellor is in the wrong position) and the minifigure is pretty cool. The tail in the back is attached to a chain, so when it is pulled, the bucket raises, simple, cool, and works. The set has some great parts and can help make plenty of cool things, especially with the two 10x10 quarter corners and the 10x10 octagon plate! Overall agreat set, but probably could have used a shark or something.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Great color scheme
Stickers worth putting on
Big trans yellow canopy
Scout vehicle detaches from main
Working compass on tail
Bucket raises and lowers based on pulling tail back
Great minifig

Cons:

Yeah, the stickers have to be applied just right, but the gimmicks are actually a lot of fun. The chains are a great addition to anyone's collection and I love the escape pod. What would have made the escape pod better though is if they would have given it a little more design. It's not much more then a box when thrusters on it, but I love the idea. This is a very fun set to own with plenty to keep kids busy with.",FALSE,4,4,5,4,4
"BobaFett2","2010-09-27T17:52:12.307Z","Very Nice Set with cool functions","The Aqua Dozer is a very nice set I bought from a bricklink seller. It's from the Aquaraiders line-their second largest set (out of three) and the most interesting one by far.<h4>Parts</h4><div>I'll start with parts. When it comes to parts, this set is tops. You get loads of trans neon green propellers, along with a trans neon green dome, multiple control panels, a huge shovel, green tubes, and many, many other great parts. The stickers aren't amazing for MOCing and can be removed (though this reduces value).</div><h4>Building Experience</h4><div>This is a fun set to build, though it can be a bit confusing. It's not an amazing build, but it's satisfying.</div><h4>Playability</h4><div>This set, like many older sets, is great for playability. It has a few interesting functions, and while not swooshable like many other ships, it has a great little mini craft and makes a really cool underwater dozer. Some of the functions include:<br>* A detachable mini craft</div><div>* The shovel can be raised or lower by moving the fins in back</div><h4>Overall</h4><h4>Pros</h4><div><ul><li>Great parts</li><li>Green</li><li>Cool funtions</li><li>Interesting Build</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4></div><div><ul><li>Wierd Stickers cool in aquazone but not fitting for non-aquazone</li><li>1 minifigure only</li></ul>Overall, I think this is a great set and recommend it to aquazone and sci-fi fans, along with anyone at all interested in this set.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-11T18:02:21.273Z","Aqua Dozer Underwater Fun","<p>Set #2161 Aqua Dozer: The second Aqua Raider I and my brother owned, there were only three in total from the Aquaraider Sub-Theme and I feel that all three looked impressive and perfect additions to the Aquazone Theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Aqua Dozer is a solidly built craft and quite large. There are however two little pieces that were notorious for falling off during play, the two green propellors on the front of the dozer used to lower and raise the craft. The green elements are also a nice rarity from LEGO and great for people who are looking for green parts to MOC something up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Aqua Dozer is the primary vehicle, inside however is a small control section which is designed to come out and be used either as an evacuation ship (in case of accidents.) or to get into small nooks and crannies to discover where the energy crystals are located. This set also includes a compass (I think it really works too as a compass, of course it has been a while since I had the part so I can't remember if it actually worked like a real compass should.) and of course some chromed silver torpedoes and daggers for the Aquaraider to use against the denizens of the deep. (Or any Aquanauts foolish enough to get in their way.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that all three of the Aquaraider sets were solidly built craft that added a great new play feature in the Aquazone Theme, it worked a little bit better than the Stingrays and Hydronauts. Of course I only was exposed to two of the three sets, but I'm sure that the third vehicle was also solid. The Aqua Dozer is a great set, great fun, with a lot of potential. I strongly recommend them to fans of the under water themes of LEGO or if you're just looking for some great submarines to display among your naval vessels.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

When I did get it- I built it with jittery yet giddy precision- heart pounding in panic when I was unable to find a piece for a split second. Of course as always- all the pieces were there. I called 'him' ""Barracuda"" for the longest time, and I never had the heart to disassemble him. <br><br>...My younger siblings had no such compunction. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
