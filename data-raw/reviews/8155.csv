Actually I got 3, as you got one for each purchase over $30 in the store, if I recall correctly. (It was either you take&nbsp;the set, or some other thing, it might have been a $5 discount -laughs- :-] ) Anyway, 300 of these were made and I have 1/100 of them, I guess. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Building the Set:</h4>
<p>Before I get ahead of myself, the set comes in a tall zipper-close plastic bag, and instructions are printed on a fold-out printer-paper texture page. The parts are a good combination, with some rare ones floating around to make the set unique(-er). Building the&nbsp;set is very short and easy, with a few genius building techniques that&nbsp;make this a great display model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Playability:</h4>
<p>Not much here, as the set is easily dwarfed by a couple of minifigures, but good for a statue in your city if you so choose. The main point of the set is just to be a rare model that you can look at and say: ""Yep. I was there when that store first opened, and here's my proof."" I intend to keep all of them, as they are extremely rare, at least for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you got your hands on one of these, one, we may have met :) and two, consider yourself lucky to have&nbsp;one. The only thing I wonder is, how much do these go for on ebay... </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the design, display-factor, and great parts in this set. And pretty much for free, it has great value for your money :). I might post a scan or pic of the instructions and pics of this set on brickshelf, so look out for them in my folder (link if you click on my username). Happy collecting!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5
