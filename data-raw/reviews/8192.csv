Severus Snape is the perfect Lego figure to make a key chain of, other than Gregory Goyle (who they should make a key chain of). The figure is also the same figure as the Snape figure in the 4th edition Hogwarts Castle, which is cool. This key chain gets an overall 5/5 for coolness and rareness.<br>",TRUE,5,5,1,1,5
