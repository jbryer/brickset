It has a great amount of minifigures and accesories. Whereas, in some cases, the details are lacking. Below is a Pros and Cons list to help explain.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pro 1: The minifigures are detailed. Ollivander is exceptionally done and Fred and George are perfect. If anything, the minifigures are the main reason to purchase this set. Fenrir and Luscious are well done, also. The Goblins could be better. 
<li>Pro 2: The details inside Ollivanders shop are marvelous. There are wands everywhere and the exploding desk feature is very unique and cool.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Con 1: The Goblin minifigures are not very detailed. They need to have better painted faces, such as the improved Dobby in the 'Freeing Dobby' set. 
<li>Con 2: The details inside Gringotts and Borgin &amp; Burkes. All Gringotts has to show inside is one vault and one desk. This is ,frankly, mediocre. On the other hand Borgin &amp; Burkes has no details whatsoever. All that is inside of this shop is the Vanishing Cabinet and the Floo Powder network. There are no creepy displays as it so deeply needs to make it 'Borgin &amp; Burkes'.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the cons are astronomical, this is still a pleasant set. I enjoy it very much. I especially enjoy having the chance to add Fred, George, and Ollivander to my Harry Potter collection. The set is 2,025 pieces and is $150.00 in the U.S. I greatly appreciate Lego making the effort to make a good set, but frankly, I think they might've missed the mark a little.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"Niallskie","2011-01-15T21:59:56.13Z","Small changes hits big with collectors","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Got this set from our local Lego store, and was very lucky as it was the last one when I got there. Was very excited to build it but took me a couple of weeks to actually build it. When I open it, I was amazed because the instructions were in a package with a backing board to keep it flat. That small change does hit big with collectors as I myself had a bunch of intruction mangled in the past, and at one time have my stickers stick on one of the instruction page. Another change I noticed is that they distributed the minifigures again per bag, unlike when the put all the minifigures in bag 1. When I got my Hogwarts Castle, bag 1 was missing when I opened it and found out the box was tampered. Good thing I was able to change it for a complete set when I returned it. Putting all the minifigures in one bag is asking for trouble. A big salute to the lego boys for this changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; On to the review, this set is nothing less than awesome and worth the wait. The minifigures alone is basically half the price of the set. The three buildings are build fantastically. All of them are different in their own ways, color scheme are amazing. The Ollivander's is fantastic, very much detailed and loved how the usual railings is used as a ladder. Would have been nice if the hats, owls, bats and pots is inside. Its all great but with them being outside its prone to being lost. Borgin and Burke's does eminate a dark aura with its build and color of the store, a bit more knick knacks inside to add details would have been nice. The Ollivander's Bank is definitely the best among the set, build was really something, love how it opens up as well. The pillar brick is new to me, but it does make the Bank look classy. Only thing is that the two pillars on the second floor does swing all the way down. Would be nice if they put a stopper to keep the pillar in its place. Other than that this is an awesome set, worth buying if you have the money. In that case worth saving up for.</p>

"sudorum","2011-05-26T17:46:35.4Z","The Largest Alley in all of Wizardom","<p>Including the older sets, this is the largest HP set to be released, with over 2000 pieces to its name. The twelve minifigures that come with the set (including the skeleton) are excellent additions. Of the twelve minifigs, five are brand new. These would be the Weasleys, the flesh skinned goblins, and Ollivander. However, there is a downside. The two Weasley twins are identical except for their faces (which is to be expected), and the two Gringott&#39;s goblins are identical except for their pants. Ollivander is the best of the minifigures. The back of his torso is printed, and he has an alternate face. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the three buildings, Ollivander&#39;s store is the best. The bottom half of the building is decorated with two brown shelves that hold packages of wands. Unfortunately, these &quot;wands&quot; are not the typical minifigure compatible sticks, but decals. There&#39;s also a desk with&nbsp;a newspaper (the same exact one featured in the burrow and Hogwarts) and a pen ensconced upon it. In addition, the desk explodes through the use of a concealed lever beneath it. One of those ladders that you often see in old libraries leads to the top floor. It features green potions on the left, another shelf of decal wands in the center, and a crate which contains actual stick wands to the right. The exterior of Borgin and Burkes is flawless. There are numerous windows that are arranged in a unique manner. Their ingenious use is most evident on the roof. However, it&#39;s the interior of the building where problems become evident. Inside is a rotating fireplace&nbsp;that is meant to&nbsp;simulate a floo powder effect, a window skeleton display, and an annoying &quot;vanishing&quot; cabinet, which I&#39;ve never been a fan of. The main problem is the lack of ghoulish items on sale, like the ones featured in the Knockturn Alley version of Borgin and Burkes. No amount of glow in the dark pieces can compensate for this either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gringott&#39;s suffers from similar problems. Though the building&#39;s interior is detailed, the structure itself&nbsp;is incredibly miniscule. It&#39;s essentially an intricately detailed wall with cupboard sized space behind it. This becomes more evident when you account for the fact that a desk composes one half of the interior, and a safe the other half. The safe contains four gold pieces and a translucent red crystal, identical to the kind featured in the Power Miners sets. The exterior of Gringott&#39;s includes the massive doors and bent columns that are featured in the movie. Despite this set&#39;s obvious flaws, I rate it a five. This is due to its bargain price of $150 for 2000 pieces and its multitude of elements.&nbsp;</p>

"Andrew85","2011-01-20T07:57:30.277Z","Not just for Harry Potter fans!","<p><br></p><p>For starters I am not a massive HP fan, I have not read the books but have seen some of the films so how accurate these sets are to peoples imagination and from the films is not something I can say. But for me this set is excellent and should definatley become part of your collection.<br></p><p>When I was first aware of this set I wasn't blown away by it, but then it did grow on me, especially due to the varied selection of parts. The 3 separate builds were fun and also used a great amount of building techniques which I will probably use for my own MOC's in the future. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>This set has an excellent assortment of pieces in many colours such as<br></li><li>Black/Green and brown windows, dark blue roof bricks, so many hinges (25+), I love hinges! many small useful gold pieces and best of all the new 2x2 round profile brick (One of the major reasons for buying this set). There are many smaller pieces in great colours which are a little bit more hidden (Too many to mention). The many minifigures are extremely detailed so hardcore HP fans and MF collectors will be delighted here. This set is great for people whom make MOC's and like alot of detail. The inside of the buildings have a few details such as furniture and although there is some open space I believe the designer was giving some space to put the great figs.<br></li></ul><br><br>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The trio of buildings are a 'little' underwhelming due to size, its a big box and the buildings do look big on there but not so much so once built. I never like the prices of Lego going up, I suppose it is reasonably priced for a licensed set, the high quality and number of figs push it up. I make a slight comparison to the 'Town plan' set from a couple of years ago which was around 90GBP, similar number of bricks and figs, 3 buildings and nice selection of pieces and colours. The price increase to 133GBP is a little steep but I guess thats what we have to pay now.<br></li></ul><ul><li><br></li></ul>
<p>To conclude both HP and non-HP fans will find alot they will like here, maybe diehard HP fans a little more :) <br></p><p>If price is not an issue buy right away! it is also worth adding the video on Shop at home speaks with the designer whom shows some of the features of Diagon Alley and mentions he made the 'medieval market village 10193'. This set is nearly half the price, again uses many great pieces and similar building techniques. If you like that you will love this! I own 2 of them :)<br></p><p>Perhaps if diagon alley had not been released, creating your own HP scenes would be possible from this set.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Final conclusion I give it 94/100<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"f_man","2011-07-15T14:10:08.643Z","One of LEGO's best","<p>I saved up my money for quite some time to buy this set and when it arrived it just happened to be on the opening day of the newest and last Harry Potter movie. Quite a great coincidence.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The&nbsp;instructions and stickers were in a safe plastic covering with a piece of cardboard to keep them from bending or ripping.</li><li>-Ollivander figure</li><li>-Many parts in new or unusual colors</li><li>-Some interesting building techniques, like the roof of Borgin and Burkes</li><li>-Very well priced for the amount of pieces it has</li><li>-Bags were numbered</li><li>-The Weasley Twins!!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The building could get monotonous and a few sections of Gringotts do not hold on together well until the model is finished, could be difficult for some.</li><li>-We get a lot of repeat characters (Harry, of course, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, Fenrir, and another Mr. Malfoy!)</li><li>-This is not a set for playing with, the few features it has are rather useless. THis set is to be displayed or stripped for great parts.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is definitely the biggest and most expensive set I've ever bought and I was not disappointed.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5
"Yope","2011-05-18T10:05:45.023Z","Wand-erful!","<p>After much saving I have finally purchased Diagon Alley and I can honestly say it is magnificent!</p><p>The three buildings are very varied and full of detail and life. It's going to be hard not to let my obsession for Lego Harry Potter take over in the rest of the review.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Ollivanders is exellently characterful and very true to the films. The ladder and the windows are particularly brilliant.</li><li>Gringotts is marvellous, the details are awesome and the style is perfect. The new 2X2 profile brick adds extra substance and the pillars are perfect.</li><li>Borgin and Burkes is equally intricate, the roof especially is effective in adding vibrancy to the building. The glow-in-the-dark pieces are a nice touch too.</li><li>Now, the minifigures. I'm pretty sure I squealed when I saw the Weasley twins were included (Fred especially!) Mr. Ollivander is a great exclusive and the rest are really nice too.</li><li>I was also happy to get a chocolate frog! For me it is the little things like this which have made Harry Potter such a successful Lego franchise.</li><li>The other accesories are very fitting too.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I'm clutching at straws to deliver the flaws here but what's the point of a review without them? Firstly Borgin and Burkes is a bit sparsely decorated, there's just a skeleton and the vanishing cabinet (it links to the one in 4842 Hogwarts). I reckon an additional table with some ""dark"" items would've been nice.</li><li>The set is Diagon Alley so I was initially surprised to see Borgin and Burkes, perhaps a Wealeys' Wizarding Wheezes would have been more appropriate.</li><li>I would have prefered other characters than Greyback and Lucius Malfoy, just something new like a typical witch or a new death eater like Dolohov or someone but on the whole the minifigures were great.</li></ul>
<p>On the whole it is a 5 star set without doubt. Even if you aren't a huge Harry Potter fan its worth getting. The build lasts a good few hours but kept me hooked with its different techniques. That's all I think so thanks for reading!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"dragon_teenager","2011-08-11T11:31:18.743Z","An absolute gem","I bought this set for my birthday and it is an absolute joy. All three buildings are interesting and unique, but the standout is really Ollivander's. It just drips atmosphere from the 19th century and is chock full of neat little details, such as a ladder to reach the top shelves and even an exploding desk. Some very nice exterior details, such as rounded corners and lamps, make it a truly remarkable little wand shop. Gringotts is also excellent, although the aesthetic is very different; it has a very ""grand"" feel, as opposed to Ollivader's homey and cluttered interior. Both buildings are excellent. <br><br>Slightly less impressive is Borgin &amp; Burkes, which (according to the books) doesn't even exist in Diagon Alley - I suppose LEGO felt there needed to be an ""evil"" presence to increase the appeal to kids. Personally, I think that's silly, since this is far from a kid's set. Regardless, the building is still quite unique, and surprisingly fun to build. It has a very interesting aesthetic and a pretty nice looking exterior; it's just a shame the interior isn't so pretty. <br><br><br>PRO: <br>- Fantastic selection of minifigures including 3 (or 2, depending on how you count them) exclusives. <br><br>- Wonderfully varied construction on each of the 3 buildings, with some very creative techniques on display. <br><br>- Loads of fun accessories including owls, cauldrons, and lamp posts to complete the scene. <br><br>- Great little details like ""wanted"" posters hanging from the sides of buildings and ""daily prophet"" tiles. <br><br>- Excellent price/part ratio, especially for a licensed set. <br><br>- Appeals to both Harry Potter and City fans. <br><br>- Fantastic display piece. <br><br><br>CON:<br>- It is a little expensive, even if you're getting a good deal. <br><br>- Borgin &amp; Burkes feels slightly out of place. <br><br>- There are stickers, and unfortunately they do add a lot of atmosphere to the scene, so it is difficult to skip them. <br><br><br>In conclusion, this is without a doubt one of the strongest sets of 2011. It's right up there with Medieval Market Place. I highly recommend this to Harry Potter fans, who are sure to get a kick out of the amazing details and fantastic re-imagining of this iconic locale. Even non-HP fans will appreciate the awesome construction, great piece selection, and host of fantastic accessories. A+ set. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,4

"LegoHPnut","2012-04-13T15:00:03.107Z","Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley!","<p>I've been a huge Lego HP fan ever since the Sorceror's Stone sets were announced over ten years ago.&nbsp; I bought nearly every set released since then, and am able to say that this set is made for HP fans.&nbsp; Diagon Alley is the first set to feature the&nbsp;same level of&nbsp;detail as the films and books.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The exclusive and rare minifigs.&nbsp; Fred, George, OLLIVANDER, the Goblins, and even a Ron Weasley, who has gone from being the most common HP figure next to Harry himself to being nearly impossible to get! 
<li>The details in Gringotts and Ollivanders are outstanding.&nbsp; Ollivanders really captures the cramped shop featured in the movies, and Gringotts feels much larger than it really is due to having hinges.&nbsp; The ornate columns and grand chandelier really add to the building. 
<p>The little accessories that come with it are awesome. A chocolate frog, cauldrons (which have a fish in them for some reason), all the new owls, and the really cool lampposts.</p>
<p>I also liked the use of black skeleton legs for the roof of Borgin and Burkes, which is a great segway into the...</p></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Borgin and Burkes is very disappointing.&nbsp; The outside looks fantastic, but the inside is completely bare. BORING. No cool, dark artifacts like the COS set. No amount of glow in the dark bricks can make up for this. Maybe the Leaky Cauldron would've been a better choice. 
<li>ANOTHER Lucius Malfoy.&nbsp; He's just getting annoying, now.&nbsp; I would have greatly preferred new, exclusive figure like Tom the bartender or even another Draco, but I'm getting really tired of Lucius. 
<li>Finally, there really isn't much playability.&nbsp; Ollivander's has an exploding desk, but you can only do that so many times before it gets old.&nbsp; This is definetly more of a&nbsp;display set.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, a 10/10.&nbsp; So far, this is the final HP set to ever be released, and Lego really went out with a bang. This is the closest to the perfect HP set we'll probably ever see.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"HarleyMeenen","2016-09-02T18:20:54.747Z","All-Around Excellent Set","<p>I can&#39;t say enough good things about this set. It&#39;s huge, it looks great, has excellent details, and several unique minifigures.</p>

<p>Half of the figures are available only in this set. My personal favorites are Fred and George, who both have two faces so they can either be true twins or differentiated, which I found to be a nice touch. The goblins also have unique heads and short legs.</p>

<p>Each of the three buildings has extra details added in. Ollivanders&nbsp;of course has wands, but also a pop-off feature in the front desk for when the wand has not chosen the wizard. It has two floors, with a ladder for moving between them. Borgin and Burkes (which, as others have pointed out, is not technically in Diagon Alley but oh well) has the vanishing cabinet. Gringotts includes a vault for storing money. There are also some extra details, such as lamps and items for sale, which adds to the atmosphere of the scene.&nbsp;Every section is a unique build, so it doesn&#39;t get particularly repetitive, and they all look quite nice when completed.</p>

<p>Admittedly, there are a few downsides to this set. There are a number of stickers, several of which can be tricky to place and two which makes up the Gringotts sign across two different bricks, meaning they have to be very carefully lined up right on the edges to look right. There are a lot of windows on each building as well, and it can get annoying repeatedly snapping panes into frames (and it&#39;s even worse to take them apart.)</p>

<p>All in all, however, this is a great set. I have built it several times and it easily takes&nbsp;three days, and that&#39;s if I devote my entire evening to building. It is a long-term, immersive project and it is well worth it.&nbsp;</p>
