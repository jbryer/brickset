<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Very small polybag, no instructions.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Small, basic parts, mainly slopes, two plates and a brick. The main colours are black and white.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Nothing special there. Each models take half a minute to build.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I've built all the models. The penguin is the best, it's neat. The strange animal in the upper right corner (which supposed to be maybe a kind of bird) is not so good, its wings(?) are too small compared to its legs. The whale is a typical 'B-model', but it's creative.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I think most of the Lego fans can build this small set from his/her collection. If you get it as a gift, be happy about it. But don't buy it - I saw this set for sale on the Internet, and it costs too much. Doesn't worth the money!<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
