It doesn't.</li><li>The game's quests are rather simple</li><li>No bank, and there's tons of stuff to collect</li></ul><br><p>Overview: If your a hardcore gamer, don't get this. There's no PVP or level system. If you hate trolls, don't get it either. There's been a successful train in one spawn area for 5 days now, and you can't kill one enemy without a pack defeating you, and a ton of kill stealers. <br></p><p>This game, however, is very fun. Mind the kill stealers and trainers, you can have a really fun time, especially with the Best Friends feature, good teamwork when it comes to the survival minigame and dragon minigame, and make the minifigure you played with when you were little (Lots of fun parts to start, lots of cool ones later too!). Factions are fun, because if you like up close fights, Setinel and Venture. Long distance fighters will enjoy Paradox and Assembly.</p><p><br></p><p>Final Score: 9/10, 10/10 if there was a way to stop kill stealing, and a way for the LU Team to shut down the train.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"GBP_Chris","2011-07-29T23:35:30.42Z","Incredible Game - Maybe even the best!","This game is incredible! From the Venture Explorer to the battlefields of Crux Prime to the Imagination at Nexus Tower, every part of the game is INCREDIBLE! The best function for pro builders is the property building, where not only do you have a large supply of bricks both new and classic, but when you finish, you can program them to come to life! The battles and weapons are awesome as well. Avant Gardens Survival and Forbidden Valley Dragon battle are the best mini games of the whole universe! Buy if you can<div><br></div><div>(Did I mention the is racing better than Lego racers or Lego Racers 2?)</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
