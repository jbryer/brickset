In the game, the rockets can be taken apart into three sections, and then be swapped with other rocket parts. With the model, you could do the same thing! It is very nicely colored, matching well with the Lego Universe Astronaught figure. Though it doesn't have much playability, being it's just a rocket, it's still fun to swoosh around, pretending that the astronaught is visiting different planets (or in my case, my tables). It's also very cool that you can use the code that comes with it and enter it into the game.&nbsp;The only thing I don't like about it though, is the fact that not everyone can get it (though it does make me feel proud), and that not all of the peices of the rocket can be pressed closely together, leaving a little gap between the cockpit and the engine peices (but that's only my opinion, and being I'm analretentive...). Other then that, it's a very cool set, and well worth it since I got it for free, (thanks mom!). </p>
<p>Hopefully Lego will start making other give aways, and maybe buyable Lego Universe sets too!</p>
