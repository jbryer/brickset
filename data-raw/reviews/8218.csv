Was worried I wouldn't get it.<br><br>The figure is as pictured. Cool screen printed logo on torso, orange helmet and orange hands are a plus.<br><br>1 major disappointment was that he didn't come with oxygen tanks!

"Nth_Brick","2011-08-11T16:39:35.96Z","The Nexus Astronaut","<p>This is no doubt a really cool little Minifig.&nbsp; The torso print is unique and fairly exclusive (however, I hear that they are now giving them out to anyone who buys LEGO Universe at the LEGO Store) and it is fairly rare to get orange minifig parts.&nbsp; The head is basically a revamped classic LEGO face with eyebrows, more detailed eyes and a less cheesey smile.&nbsp; He is fairly fun to play with and is a decent little astronaut that can work in pretty much anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for the downside.&nbsp; He is made of the low-quality chinese plastic and really has no vehicles/tools that you can either buy or are included with this thing.&nbsp; That said, he can seem a bit out of place among other astronaut/space minifigs.&nbsp; Also, he was supposed to be a pre-order exclusive.&nbsp; Now, LEGO is giving them away to everyone who buys the discounted game.&nbsp; These late-comers also get a LEGO Universe Rocket AND 2 whole months of free play!&nbsp; I feel cheated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, here's the simple breakdown of the LEGO Universe Nexus Astronaut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Pros:</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; At one point, was exclusive to pre-order.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; He is fairly unique and you get his gear in-game with the included code card.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Cons:</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; He is no longer an exclusive thanks to LEGO handing these things out like candy to anyone who buys the game.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Made of the dreaded Chinese Plastic.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Can look a bit out of place amidst other minifigs.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, this minifig is pretty cool and would be a great addition to any collection.&nbsp; But, you need to get to a LEGO Store fast to get the great deal they are now offering.&nbsp; Despite LEGO cheating me on this, I have to reccomend this little as a really fun and cool little minifig.</p>
