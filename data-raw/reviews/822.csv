He returns as a real minifig to those who purchased US versions of the Lego Island game. He looks exactly the same as he is in the game and I am sure we all agree that he looks alot like a station master. Also the piece count on the polybag is wrong, it should be 4 pieces instead of 3 pieces. (Torso, head, cap, legs)

"Legonat","2011-09-21T13:10:08.593Z","Well, Hello! Welcome to LEGO Island!","This is a real jewel of a set. Not only is the Infomaniac what most people who have played the game think of when LEGO Island is mentioned (I think of Pepper and the Brickster though), but he is the only character from the first LEGO Island PC game to be released as a set (or is he...?). I know you're thinking that this set should be 4 pcs/pzs instead of 3 but back then minifig heads came assembled onto their torsos still perfectly removable. Weird huh? I particularly put this fig in front of the jail in 6598 Metro PD Station but he could fit into just about any town or city layout. The thing about this fig is that it has the LEGO logo printed on it's back (I also have a Brickster torso with the same logo on the back, kinda suspicious...) unlike the Infomaniac in the game but that could be fixed by rubbing the fig on rough paper (something I don't recommend). 5 stars!<br>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,1
