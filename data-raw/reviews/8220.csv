<p>He had a blast building this even though most may consider this building experience about as easy as a Lego set could be, he really lit up that he didn't need instructions to figure it out.&nbsp; For a young child this is a nice accomplishment.</p>
<p>The parts got a 5 because I'm nostalgic for the 80's and it was cool to see my son get a retro figure.&nbsp; Parts/playability also&nbsp;receive kudos as it's a figure piece and contains magnet - great for playability!&nbsp; Currently Black Falcon is separated from the rest of Legoland with the important duty of guarding the ice cube dispencer on my fridge from a certain cat that resides in my home.</p>
<p>Value for money? IT WAS FREE!&nbsp; Thank you Bricktober!&nbsp; I wish I would have remembered that for the previous 3 weeks...hey waitaminute!&nbsp; I bought that Jester not too long ago.&nbsp; TRU owes me a magnet!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
