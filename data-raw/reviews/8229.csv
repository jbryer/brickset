I went to the Czech Republic, looked for days to find new star wars sets, and I found all 8 of the new winter ones. It's at a place called Zuraco Toys! This set is soo cool. The minifigs are awesome. You get 8 regualr battle droids, 2 new pilot droids, a new gungan warrior, and JAR JAR. The pilots are new because instead of having a solid blue torso, in the middle some of the blue is replaced with regular battle droid color, but it's not a big deal. Jar Jar is very cool. Double sided torso and he has real pupils and light red gungan skin. The gungan warrior is by far the best figure in this set. He has also real pupils with a purple gungan mask and his shield his insanely awesome.(also, for those who thought his legs were transparent, there not.)

"wander099","2011-01-12T22:50:21.757Z","Great Army Builder!","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box is pretty nice, like all the new 2011 Star Wars sets.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4>There are some new parts in this set and a nice amount of tan pieces that can be used to build your own things.&nbsp; But, most of the parts are fairly standard, we've seen most of it before.<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>With this set, the minifigures are the main attraction.&nbsp; You get 8 standard battle droids, two new pilot droids, one gungan soldier, and the new Jar Jar Binks.&nbsp; This is a great army builder for droids, but I had hoped for more Gungans.<br>
<h4>The build</h4>The build was fairly simple and with only 241 pieces it didn't take very long to complete.&nbsp; The only trouble I ran into was I couldn't find one of the pieces for a few minutes, but that was my own fault for not looking properly.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Overall, the ship is nice.&nbsp; With or without the droids on the back, it makes a nice vehicle to play with.&nbsp; The things on the bottom that look like skiis make it slide along the table nicely and the model is smooth and aerodynamic.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I picked up this set for $35 CDN, and overall I would recommend it to any Star Wars fan or army builder.&nbsp; It's not a bad price (comparatively) and it definately delivers with the 12 minifigures included.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"CapnRex101","2011-01-01T06:15:13.05Z","7929 - Battle Of Naboo","<p>This set is pretty good, it is worth the money you pay for it, but lacks a certain something which some of the other recent sets have had. I just don't think the set is quite up to the same standard as some of the others from this January 2011 wave, which is a shame, but is still a nice model.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art for this set shows the Droid Transport Craft speeding across the lush plains of Naboo. Laser blasts and explosions are scattered all over the place and Jar Jar is fleeing with a Gungan soldier, possibly Captain Roos Tarpals, who accompanies General Binks throughout the battle. Battle droids which have already been unloaded are firing at the two Gungans. Several MTTs and AATs are just coming over the hill in the background ready to finish off the Gungan army.</p><p>The instructions were just fine, no mistakes and I had no missing pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a few interesting new parts in this set, particularly the two Gungan heads and the plasma shield which are all highly detailed. Also we get many parts in various shades of brown and tan which are very useful for creating your own models.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are some cool Minifigures in this set, but none of them are of the same standard as others such as Aurra Sing, Shaak Ti, Embo, the Tactical Droid and of course my personal favourite, Saesee Tiin. The two Gungans are the highlights of the figures, with some excellent detailing on them and their accessories. I especially like the new shield, which looks very much like the ones used in the Battle of Naboo from The Phantom Menace. We get a lot of Minifigures for our money, twelve! These are the two Gungans, two new pilot battle droids and eight normal battle droids (which you can never have to many of). The pilot droids have now got a small area of tan printing, which introduces some detail to the figure, unlike the pilot which features in the Separatist Shuttle set from 2009 which has an all blue torso.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build took me about fifteen minutes, it almost took longer to build the Minifigures than the vehicle itself! The build is very straightforward, there are no complicated building techniques used, so it should be very easy.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model looks pretty good as a whole, with a well designed droid storage rack, much like that of the MTT from 2007, and some nice bodywork. The set however is really improved by the Minifigures. Yet still as neither the figures nor the speeder are particularly outstanding, I find it hard to be amazed by this set. I do however like the ability to easily remove the droid storage rack.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I have to say this is probably one of the weaker sets of the first wave of 2011, however I do still really like it, and I think it is somewhat overshadowed by the brilliance of other sets like Mace Windu's Jedi Starfighter, the Bounty Hunter Gunship and the spectacular T-6 Jedi Shuttle. Certainly a useful set for creating your droid army, and that is reflected in my overall score.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"sudorum","2011-02-11T17:33:23.217Z","Binks is Back ","<p>A lone droid skiff really can&#39;t be considered an entire battle scene, which the title of the set claims it is. You&#39;ll need the MTT for that. Overall, this an average set to add to your collection. The improved Jar-Jar Binks and the Gungan with the purple shield are the highlights. The droid rack on the skiff is similar to the MTT droid rack, but holds only half as many droids, due to the spots for the guns. Also, the rack of droids can separate from the skiff, and the individual platforms that the droids rest on can be removed. This set goes well with the MTT, especially if you want a complete Naboo battle scene.&nbsp;</p>

"legoclone","2011-04-13T20:11:29.54Z","Like buying 3 battle packs and getting a good vehicle thrown in","I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this set.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an impulse buy just because I wanted a Star Wars Lego set and I saw this one I didn’t have just sitting there on the shelf.&nbsp; First off, this thing is the ultimate army builder. For what amounts to about the price of about 2 battle backs you get 12 figures to include 8 standard battle droids AND a solid vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lego did a real good job of capturing the look of the Trade Federation troop carrier.&nbsp; What is more, if you have enough battle droids you can double the carrying capacity of the vehicles droid rack simply by removing the 2x2 holder plates for the blasters (since the droids can hold their own blasters, even when folded) and have the droids sit right next to each other.&nbsp; I am even toying with the idea of extending the length of the droid track by only 2 studs which would allow it to hold a total of 20 folded battle droids – only 4 plate pieces would need to be switched out – which would still look good since the end of the vehicle sticks out past the rack. The Gungans are well done as well with elaborate head pieces which are a vast improvement over the old style single colored head Gungans.&nbsp; I also like the new transparent shield.&nbsp; I have to say this set was really worth buying. My one complaint, and it isn’t really about this set but about battle droids in generals, is that I wish their legs were separate from each other.&nbsp; I don’t know, maybe they would be too flimsy but that way but&nbsp;they would be nicer for posing.",FALSE,4,4,4,5,5

"legodude357","2011-02-28T16:31:44.777Z","A great droid army builder.","<p>I went to the store intent on buying the Imperial V-wing starfighter. But at Target there was a display that had the 2011 battle packs, and this set along with the bounty hunter gunship. I set down the V-wing and picked up this. I really want that Jar-Jar minifig. I thought. I'd never had one before. Plus, there's a second gungan as well! Plus, the old droid piliots with white printing in the middle of their chests. PLUS x8 battle droids. You can never have enough battle droids. I decided to buy the Battle of Naboo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skiff</p>
<p>The skiff is excellently made for something that I myself saw in Episode 1 for all of 1 second, but is lacking in special play features, or interesting peices. Its a basic, boring build I completed very quickly. Like 2-3 minutes. The majority of that time was placing together all the battle droids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figures</p>
<p>Ah, the real reason to get this set. When I built this I got one of my baseplates, placed the box behind the figures, and found that there are enough figures with one stud spacing between them to fill the length of the box, and have two figures not in the perimeter of the box. Wow! But, the reason why there are so many figures is this: after reading Star Wars the visual dictionary, I am now very, um, stepical of legos. What they do is determine a price point, and build something that MIGHT justify that price. If it doesn't, they add extras figures or features. They should build a model, either from the clone wars series tv show, or a rehash, then price it. But they don't. Anyway, if your droid army is lacking or you don't have one, this set will give you all you need to fill the gap. Jar-Jar and Captain Roo Tarpals are greatly printed, with detailing on their ears, along with a double printed torso. This set is worth it for the figures alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>A great looking set which has a plethora of figures, along with a great versitile vechile, as I prefer the older tan and brown droid vechiles as opposed to Blue and grey of the clone wars. I have already built an entire battle of Naboo moc, just because this set inspired me to. If you just want the figures thats fine, the skiff makes an excellent pile of plates and bricks to add to your spare parts box. I do not regret spending the cash on this, and reccomend it to a friend. Thank you for reading my review!</p>

At its core, this set is a battle pack -- and a big battle pack at that.

From a minifigure point of view, the real stars of the show here are the Gungans. LEGO did such an amazing job with these minifigures. They're just outstanding minifigures that anyone will be able to appreciate -- and it doesn't hurt that their accessories are great as well.<br><br>The Battle Droid Carrier itself is a good little set, and I consider it to be a nice improvement over the 2001 version. The droid rack on the back is similar to the one found on the MTT. It can store all eight battle droids and a blaster for each, and there is a seat in the front for each of the Battle Droid Pilots. As you would hope, the droid rack is removable. It slides off and pops back on with ease. <br><br>Playability-wise, there isn't a lot you can do with this set on its own, and that's ok.

<p>The set includes a nice selection of parts, with a good amount of the new dark tan color bricks. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The battle droids are just, well, battle droids. Never can have to many of those. The pilots are redesigned, instead of having the full blue torso, it has a blue torso piece with tan printing where the blue was on the original pilot droid. The Gungans are fully redesigned, with Jar Jar having the same torso pattern, except with new gray colors and different arms. The head molds of both Gungans remain the same, except now with more detail. Captain Tarpals (or the Gungan Warrior whatever you'd like to call him) has a new chest print as well as a new transparent shield. </p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>A few interesting techniques are used in the build, but otherwise, it isn't all that special.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The final product is, first of all, much larger than it appears at first glance. The carrier is quite nice looking, but the only feature is the detaching droid rack. The set has good playability as well, including 10 battle droids total and the 2 Gungans. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, not a bad set, nice figures, and not a bad finished product. It is certainly an improvement from the original droid carrier, but also interestingly showcases some of the same features, like the single headlight in the front and the large cover in front of the pilot. I recommend it, but like all licensed themes nowadays, it is a bit high on the price point. Only a must have if you are a big fan of Gungan Warriors or if you are looking to build up your droid army. </p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4

"Tar_Domo","2014-09-05T17:37:24.4Z","A Great Set For Army Building","<p><em>Invasion of Naboo has started. The Trade Federation droid army has landed. It&acute;s time for the gungans to help the humans in the Battle Of Naboo. </em></p>

<p>This is a great set for building a droid army. You get a nice vehicle and two gungans also. Great value for money in my opinion.</p>

<p>This cost about 30 Euros when I bought it and nowadays you have to pay about 50 Euros for a new one. This is a retired set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was quite small. The instructions were easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This has not a lot of exclusive parts. Most of it&acute;s pieces are standard bricks combined in a new way. Tt has not great potential for building MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is the great part of the set. It really contains 8 standard battle droids and 2 pilot battle droids. And even the new MTT has just 7 standard battle droids and is a lot more expensive. This also contains 2 gungans, Jar Jar Binks and a gungan soldier.</p>

<p>Standard battle droids - I don&acute;t think there&acute;s a lot new information to tell about them. They have a straight arm and a curved arm as usually. They all have the basic blasters.</p>

<p>Pilot battle droids - They are the 2011 version that is a little bit different than the version you get from nowadays LEGOs. They are weaponless and come with two curved arms.</p>

<p>Jar Jar Binks - He is not an exclusive character anymore. He has some energy balls that are nice though. They are for the Battle Of Naboo.</p>

<p>Gungan soldier - He is the only exclusive minifigure in this set. He has an energy shield for protecting himself and a kind of stick where is that energy thing. He is a good add to the set and has an exclusive headpiece.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this was quite easy and fast. There were not any very interesting moments or problems. Kind of &quot;standard-building&quot;.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is great. It&acute;s a bigger one battle droid carrier. It can carry 8 battle droids with their weapons or 16 battle droids without weapon platforms if you fix it a little bit. The carrying thing is easy to get off from the vehicle. The vehicle itself has no flick-fire missiles or any weapons. The battle droid pilots have nice spots in the vehicle.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set for army builders. It&acute;s also a set for Episode 1 fans and collectors. I recommend it.</p>
