<p>Lance Spears is the diver in this set. I really like the new printing and coloration on the figure. The yellow is a very good change from the neon green. Also, you get 2 pairs of fins and a harpoon gun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Treasure</strong></p>
<p>The treasure in this set is a gold goblet placed on a rock, and guarded by a sea snake. This set also comes with a red gem and a clear gem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Vehicle</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The small speeder is&nbsp;surprisingly good&nbsp;vehicle. The wings can move up and down, and there are 2 robotic arms to hold the gems, goblet, or sea snake.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is better than I thought it was going to be. It has good playability, and a lot of pieces for the price ( $4.99 @ LEGO.com ). It is a great Atlantis set, so pick one up!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-18T12:51:56.333Z","A New Year A New Look","<p>Set #7976 Ocean Speeder: The Ocean Speeder set was a pleasant surprise for me two weeks ago when I walked into TRU and found it sitting there during the LEGO Atlantis 25% off sale. So I got it for less than the asking price, but even so this set is worth owning even at full price and it is nice to see LEGO giving us more 6.99$ (CND) sets to choose from in the new year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ocean Speeder vehicle is a small little vessel, probably not the best item to use while hunting for treasure in dangerous waters surrounding Atlantis, but Lance Spears is ready to handle anything. He has his spear gun and he can easily take out the under water snake that is included with this set. He has a double-sided head, one side happy the other squemish looking... It does look like he's unsure about something rather than being openly scared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new torsos for the 2011 Atlantis sets are a nice contrast from the green ones, now you can have Lance wearing yellow or green if you wanted to. The small underwater pedestal for the golden goblet and jewel to be displayed on is a nice little piece and makes for a better display than just having the golden goblet sitting next to the submarine. I also like that they included a second pair of yellow flippers on the off chance you lose one set you will always have a spare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I strongly recommend this set to Atlantis lovers, I do wish though that LEGO would have included the Aqua Raiders LEGO Crab piece instead of the snake, I mean I've seen a lot of eels in my time and I don't recall any of them being red. (Plus I don't have any of those Aqua Raider pieces yet and wouldn't mind having one in a cheap set like this.)</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"sniper1by1","2011-01-12T03:51:29.1Z","Very nice Intro to the Atlantis world","<p>The new Atlantis world has reached european ground, and the smallest set of the new series is a great one.</p><p>The changed look of helmet, arms and flippers from green to yellow gives the impression, that the Atlantis world shines somehow golden. A very nice idea, I think. The speeder looks good, and it's playability is great, because the construction is pretty stable.</p><p>The gems and the golden treasure let you know that there is much more to explore in this new area.</p><p>Overall you can say: The ocean speeder is a great value for money. If you have it, then you'll want the other sets, too.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"AETerry","2011-01-03T22:02:54.463Z","Ocean Speeder Review","<p>And here we embark on the first of my 2011 Atlantis sets. Now that the way to Atlantis has been discovered and cleared, the team now explores the lost sunken city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One notable change in the series is the use of yellow for the dive suits and highlights with the predominantly red vehicles. I'm rather partial to the green coloring Atlantis had before with the Divers and Vehicles. I was also pleasantly surprised with having a second set of fins for the minifigure.&nbsp;Extra pieces are always a win, even if they're tiny pieces and the ones most likely to be lost over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main draw for this set is the Ocean Speeder Vehicle and at $6.99 this is a worthy buy for an Atlantis collection. It's a sweet little build that looks like it has wings, as if the vehicle emulates how a mantis swims and moves through water. There's little arms on the vehicle, much like another smaller set from 2010 that&nbsp;came in a polybag. 2 Gemstones - ruby and diamond. The treasure in the way of a Gold Cup sets on a nice little rock outcropping and help suggest an underwater scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the set and it's a good kick off for my 2011 Atlantis sets.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5

 Box/Instructions</h4>
<div>
 So, we get a small, maybe, as small as they get, box. It has the new Atlantis 2011 printing. Not much to say. The instructions, &nbsp;are not in a&nbsp;booklet, but fold out like the ones seen in poly-bags.</div>
<h4>
 Parts</h4>
<div>
 Lots and lots of red... We get some nice red slopes, but those aren&#39;t the parts I&#39;d consider&nbsp;notable. The notable parts are the following,</div>
<div>
 -Gold cup</div>
<div>
 -Trans white gem</div>
<div>
 -Trans RED gem</div>
<div>
 -Silver&nbsp;propellers</div>
<div>
 -Red eel</div>
<div>
 I like the parts, it really is excellent value for a price of $5 USD</div>
<h4>
 Minifigures</h4>
<div>
 One minifigure, very&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;with the trans yellow visor.. I believe those flippers in yellow are new. My favorite part is the jumpsuit, it fits in great with a post apoc MOC.The&nbsp;Atlantis&nbsp;figures have always been kinda unique to me.<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""> </span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space: pre;""> </span></div>
<h4>
 The build</h4>
<div>
 A very simple build. You start off building the main &quot;control&quot; base. After that, you add the &quot;wings&quot;, and add the propelors with&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;pegs. The submarine is done. &nbsp;Next, you build the rock thing that the treasure sits on, pretty much, from the top, up. For a small set, this packs a fun build.</div>
<h4>
 The completed model</h4>
<p>
 Excellent! The sub has handlebars for the diver to hold onto, and bendable wings,&nbsp;whether&nbsp;your stationary, or rocketing through the ruins of Atlantis.</p>
<p>
 The treasure stand thing is quite nice, you get the great dark green and tan. The cup fits onto a 1X2 jumper tile. This is a great model I&#39;ve caught myself swooshing around making sub noises with quite a few times...</p>
<h4>
 Summary</h4>
<p>
 Ocean speeder is a fantastic set. You get a great minifigure, parts, and a fun time when you finish. At $5 USD, get it before its gone!</p>

<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
Since I also collected both generations of Aquazone (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Aquazone/subtheme-Aquanauts"">Aquanauts</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Aquazone/subtheme-Aquasharks"">Aquasharks</a>; <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Aquazone/subtheme-Hydronauts"">Hydronauts</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Aquazone/subtheme-Stingrays"">Stingrays</a>) I was very excited to find this new series of sci-fi-/fantasy-underwater series back then. So now I&#39;m gonna review them all, starting with the small sets.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Standard, mostly red parts for this series. The two stickers are a nice addition to give the parts a more functional look.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>We have one underwater-explorer-minifigure (with &quot;Janus-head&quot;) and some kind of abyssal snake. The diver features the yellow visor and flippers of the newer part of the series. There are also some gems, a goblet and a harpoon added.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>What do you expect out of little more than 50 parts? Very easy, yet interesting to see, what a great design can be achieved with such little amount of parts.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished set comprises the submarine and a small batch of sea floor with some rocks and seaweed on it. The goblet, which seems to be the treasure, the diver is hunting for, rests on top of the rocks. The snake can also fit loosely on this batch.<br />
The small submarine has two small turbines facing backwards attached to the maneuvering wings. The wings can be tilted slightly. The rear end has a handle for the diver to hold on to. The front has two small grippers to hold a gem and the harpoon.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Of course, in such a small set, you can&#39;t really expect many functions and surprises. What wins it for me is the nice design and overall practical thinking, one can see in the construction. I like the colour-scheme of the series, relying on red, green and yellow, and we find those colours featured well in this set.<br />
Though being very small, it has almost anything, a scout-type sub needs: two powerful engines, maneuverability, and a small weapon. The only thing that is missing is perhaps some kind of spotlight to bring light to the deep sea.<br />
The small part of sea floor is a nice little addition, giving the set a purpose (treasure hunt) and also a little thrill with the danger noodle... erm, the sea snake.<br />
So all in all, a well done little set which fits nicely in every collection of subs!</p>

"Lego_fan_","2019-12-30T18:56:13.297Z","cute little sub","<p>This set #7976 Ocean speeder is a fun little set. It includes a little rock with seaweed, a gold cup, two gems, and a water snake. It also includes a diver with fishing spear, and of cousre the highlight: the sub itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>the sub is a tiny little build that is maybe an inch and half at most in width. It includes two claw arms to grab treasure, two movable parts on the sides. Overall i think this set is fun and i nice addition to my collection but i kinda think that it is a ripoff unless you get for $2.50 or less. But if you are as hard core a collector as me you most likely need this set.&nbsp;</p>
