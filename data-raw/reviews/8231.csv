"Hedgehog222","2010-12-04T18:38:32.33Z","WOW!","<p>-<strong>Minifigures</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, this set has 2 new figures. The first one is the diver Axel Storm. He has a light gray helmet with a yellow visor, and yellow fins. The second figure is a hammerhead shark warrior with a soft plastic headpiece with a trans-red minifigure head that has teeth and little eyes on it. He also has a trident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Treasure</strong></p>
<p>The treasure in this set is a sand green&nbsp;Atlantian shield on top of a&nbsp;pillar. I love the new pillar pieces and the shield.&nbsp;Also, there is a light blue gem and a rare orange gem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-Vehicle</strong></p>
<p>The vehicle in this set is really cool. It has&nbsp;2 harpoons on the sides, 2 robotic arms to grab the shield or gems, and poseable legs. The&nbsp;legs have a very cool look to them, and they are pretty sturdy. The walker transforms by pivoting the feet downwards, moving the legs up, and turning them sideways. When the walker tranforms, it turns into a nice little speeder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set&nbsp;was definately worth $9.99 because of all the new parts and lots of cool features. The one thing I don't like about this set is that the pillar looks a little bland, but that can be&nbsp;fixed with some modifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"desire4one","2010-12-16T01:30:58.47Z","Undersea Transformer...Submarine in disguise.","<p>This little set is a keeper for $10.&nbsp; Everything in this set is a nice solid average - you shouldn't be running out and paying top dollar, but if you come across it, do yourself a favor and pick it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set consists basically of the submarine/robot and the minifigs.</p>
<p>The vehicle has a lot of red pieces and a few hard to find parts.&nbsp; The movement in the model actually reminds you of a mechanical transformation.&nbsp; The one draw back is the propellers are set up front, and would be better suited sitting near the back.</p>
<p>The hammerhead shark minifigure was a nice surprise and actually looked as cool on the box as it did out of the box.&nbsp; The head piece underneath actually has a gaping maw of fangs and two small beady eyes and looks just at cool without the hammerhead head piece.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The playability doesn't offer much, but it's at least PLAYABLE, which some sets don't even offer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you get the chance pick this one up.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"sniper1by1","2011-01-16T04:56:10.55Z","Transformers the second, very well done!","The second set of Atlantis in 2011 is perfect. It is cheap and there are new, very useable parts: the lego columns have an awesome design.<br>There are also new bad guys to defeat, here it is the hammerhead shark. The head of this minifig has a strange look, that fits perfectly to the world of Atlantis. But don't worry, with the seabed Strider, a submarine scooter which transforms into a robot-like machine there is no doubt that the team will find Atlantis.<br>Even though the idea of a transformer is already implemented at set no. 8080, it is absolutely amazing that it was possible to create a transforming vehicle with standard parts and also in such a tiny way.<br>Concerning that set 7977 is a small one (9.99 EUR), but with so great features, there is nothing else for it but to give 100% for this. This has to be in every collection of lego-fans, so... why do you still read this? Get up and get it before it is too late ;-)<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"AETerry","2011-01-04T15:22:28.24Z","Seabed Strider Review","<p>Another new 2011 Atlantis set to kick off the year with...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At $9.99, this set isn't too bad. Two new minifigures, Atlantis Diver and Hammerhead Shark Warrior. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shark Warrior in this set is a wow for me, the head piece looks great and the ""standard"" head underneath is a transparent piece with a huge gaping mouth full of sharp teeth. It looks very intimidating for a minifigure. The Diver has the new yellow suits/coloring for this year's sets. And like the little Ocean Speeder set, there is/was an extra set of diving fins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The column piece that comes in this set to suggest that the Strider is exploring underwater ruins could have been just a brick or two taller and not so short. As far as these new column pieces go, I'd love to see more... get enough of them and Greek&amp;Roman style architecture could be done with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Seabed Strider itself isn't too shabby of a build. And for a set this size, it does a transformation that I've only seen with a few other larger sets. It can go from being a sub-type submersible for helping the Diver get to the floor bed quickly and it can change to a Walker-Bot mode as the Diver more carefully navigates and explores underwater ruins. A slightly different design build could have placed the propelers in back and make it so the legs can more easily walk.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4

His torso is double sided as well, both sides look the same but there is some differences. His torso has pipes printed on his torso, that are ment to be going into his helmet.

"Odeinoichus","2012-01-22T16:08:25.58Z","Atlantis Shield, Hammerhead Shark Mini-Fig, Fun for All","<p>Set #7977 Seabed Strider: This LEGO Atlantis set is an impressive item for such a small model. It includes two Mini-Figs, a submarine and a small remnant of Atlantis in the form of a small colomn from one of their temples. (Or something.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model is one of the better Mini-Subs from the line, it does feature stickers for details, however it also features&nbsp;joints to turn the Seabed Strider from an open-water mech into a mini-sub in a sort of transformation function. Many of the pieces are the typical red found in other Atlantis sets, however LEGO designers have really improved the basic Mini-Sub design by incorporating Exo-Force Villain arms in place of the Battle Droid arms for the subs grasping claws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The small Colomn featured in this set is pretty neat and I'm glad to have the pieces, hopefully they'll be used in a lot of more LEGO sets to come. The Atlantis shield is a great Mini-Figure accessory with a unique print and coloring on it. (It's a light shade of green.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diver (I've forgotten his name) features a double sided torso print with diving gear and a double sided head, on top of that for accessories he has two harpoon guns on his sub and not one, not two, but three sets of yellow flippers. So you have some spares for other diving mini-figs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hammerhead warrior is not only a highly detailed Mini-Fig, but if you happen to lose the massive Hammerhead hat piece his transparent red head features not only the tooth filled mouth print, but two extra eyes. He also carries the same golden hued trident as the other Undersea Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this set is a great little number for some unique parts, has a fun mini-sub model that is highly playable and a cheap way to troop build the Hammerhead Warrior. (And as a bonus you'll also have an army of Mini-Subs, Divers and enough flippers to deck out three platoons worth of Mini-Figs.) I strongly reccomend it.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4

"Sobel","2020-04-29T16:49:43.043Z","Kind of a walker, yet no walking here","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
This mech-like underwater vehicle looked quite promising, but, at least in my opinion, could not live up to the expectations.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Again, mainly the red parts that define this series. Several slopes and hinges are with the set, as well as no less than ten stickers, which I found to be a little too much. Also included is a very small patch of sea floor with a small pillar and an atlantean shield on top of it and two gems.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set features two minifigures, a diver with yellow-themed gear and a hammerhead-shark-guy. The atlantean guard looks pretty impressive, I like the design of the head. He wields a trident and the diver has two vehicle-mounted harpoons at his disposal.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Really not very challenging, the hinges at the &quot;legs&quot; might cause some trouble for younger builders. The abundance of stickers is a little annoying, especially, because there are many narrow stickers that have to be placed very carefully.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model again looks quite flashy and elegant, like most of this series do. The &quot;engine&quot;-part is quite bulky with the two harpoons mounted on each side, still in reach for the pilot. His handlebar is at the back of the &quot;engine&quot;-part, as always. At the front are two grippers and two small spotlights.<br />
To both sides are forward-facing propellers attached to the &quot;knees&quot;(?) that drive the whole thing forward when in &quot;travel-mode&quot;. This mode sees the lower parts of the legs and the feet folded backwards, so the whole thing becomes even more stream-lined.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set&#39;s biggest asset is its design. Even though it is really not that big, it looks quite impressive and has a unique touch to it. But, for me, there is not much more to it. OK, the legs can be brought in a different position for travelling underwater, but the concept of &quot;striding&quot; is somewhat missed. The model has no walking-function whatsoever and that&#39;s what I would have expected from a set that has the term &quot;Strider&quot; in its description. Also, the tiny piece of sand with the pillar looks ridiculous. A 4x4 plate would have been more adequate in my eyes.<br />
So while having a very good design and basic functions, this set could not live up to what its name implied and the expectations that came with it.</p>

"Galaxy12_Import","2019-09-17T21:23:18.297Z","Scavenge the Seabed in Style","<p>Even though the mech appears to be the main feature of this little Atlantis set I was more attracted by the Hammerhead warrior, and this set is&nbsp;my first recollection of those fluted 2x2 round bricks (gotta have &#39;em!)</p>

<p>At the standard $10 price point it is another starter&nbsp;kit intended to either supplement a larger Atlantis collection or get you hooked on the theme; it was not much of either for me but served to provide some unique minifigs and a good stock of quite versatile pieces.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2019-12-31T00:43:15.94Z","Slick sub","<p>Lego set #7977 Seabed strider is a must have for your Atlantis collection. This set is from the second release of Atlantis sets and contains a whopping 105 parts.</p>

<p>The minifigures included are a male diver, and a hammerhead warrior.</p>

<p>It contains a little side build which appears to be a part of a pillar and it has a trident printed on the green element.</p>

<p>The sub has two claw arms to grab treasure, to spinning propellers, and the legs can be moved from mech stance to sub mode. The sub/ mech is about 5&#39;&#39; high when standing and about&nbsp;the same when is sub stance.</p>

<p>Overall i think this set has some great play and display value. I would recamend this set to any Lego aquatic fans or person who likes collecting mechs.</p>
