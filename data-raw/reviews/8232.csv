It is eerily life-like. The bulging eyes, the mouth full of teeth, this fish is a great design--it looks like it'll bite your finger off. And it's done without fake-organic style bricks (okay, maybe the old green dragon wings qualify, but they are a classic piece.)&nbsp;</p><p>The rest of the set is fine. Fun figures, and a few of the new ""pillar"" cylinders (boy do I need a thousand of those.) But the star is the fish, the model is great, and it is made of a lot of nice, useful, dark green parts. Well done, LEGO designers.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AETerry","2011-01-04T23:21:12.227Z","Angler Attack Review","<p>And here we are with the third of my 2011 Atlantis sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was a bit skeptical at first due to the departure of the black theme for the 2010 Atlantis Creatures. But I gamely went on and bought it as I want the new Angler Fish Warrior minifigure and sets featuring those awesome columns. I do hope LEGO will be selling the individual element pieces so we can build MOCs with those snazzy columns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The part of the set featuring the new Column has it looking like it's fallen over from it's time underwater. There's touches of seaweed to give the impression of being underwater and there is a gold treasure chest with two gems (1 blue, 1 green) and a gold Atlantean helmet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's two minifigures, an Atlantean Diver and an intimidating looking Angler Fish Warrior. The Fish Warrior has a mouth printed on his torso and a special head piece so his head is placed lower down over his torso. He's just a mean looking little character. The Diver features the new yellow look for the suits instead of 2010's lime or neon green. He's also carrying a camera for taking pictures of his finds and discoveries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Diver has a small Speeder to help him get around or get away from danger quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prize Winner for this set is the giant Angler Fish. Angler Fish look fearsome and the only thing more fearsome would have been if LEGO does a model of the Hairy Angler. What I hadn't realized before is that one of the Angler's teeth is gold. His jaw has a little pull tab in the design so that during play, you can open and close his toothy maw. The tail looks a little funny to me, I'd have done a design where instead of spinning, it could move back and forth/side to side like a real fish tail. The side fins are classic Dragon Wings cast in a dark green. The light lure on the Angler is a lego gem, so you can either be luring an unsuspecting diver by either the assumed piece of treasure or light. Finishing this build off is something we'll all have to live with for the Atlantean sets are the stickers. On the Angler, they are a bit tricky to figure out how to get them matched up to the proper side of the fish. What helps is remembering to keep the triangle symbol oriented up like an arrow. What I liked with the stickers, once you finally get them on is the texture they have to give a sense of leather or scales on this huge monstrosity.</p>

<ul><li>Pro 1: The fish is absolutly the big star of this set.</li><li>Pro 2: Nice minifigs.</li><li>Pro 3: Did I say I LOVE the fish? It look so ugly you just have to love it.</li><li>Pro 4: Nice seaweed.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The fish can't rest on a surface without almost laying on its side.</li><li>Con 2: Why do we only get&nbsp;two front&nbsp;""golden"" knobs for the pilar instead of two front and two back?</li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>I found this at a discount price and must sat I'm tempted to buy another set just to get one more ugly fish. I don't play with my LEGO as such so the rest of the set is to me not that interesting but the diver is not that bad, and the trident holding seamonster is rather funny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nice set, and one I really feel have potentials if combined with the creator croc.</p>

"bjtpro","2012-05-01T09:21:11.03Z","Hooked on the Fish","<p>Should this be posted as a Parent or AFOL?&nbsp; There are lots of reviews by AFOLs so lets keep this one as a Parent.&nbsp; I started as a parent a few months back but my toddler son, who doesn't really like scary Atlantis things such as crabs, sharks and ugly bug-eyed fish, has brought me out of the dark ages.&nbsp; He's more interested in his Duplo stuff and he likes to fiddle around with the Creator Lighthouse, for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like others have already covered the greatness of this set pretty well, I mainly just wanted to give this model all fives and publicly state to the fine folks at Lego (who I imagine read these things?) that if this is the kind of imagination that they're going to market&nbsp;then I'm hooked, so to speak.</p>
<p>The whole Atlantis line is top-of-the-line IMO, particularly the minifigs.&nbsp; The Barracuda guy you get with this set is about the most compellingly bizarre toy I could imagine, besides the funky fish which is so ugly you just gotta love it.&nbsp; I wish it had a part in the movie, I didn't see it?&nbsp; The guy who dreamt this stuff up needs a raise!</p>
<p>It looks like this is a redo of Aqua Raiders set 7771 from 2007?</p>

"Mystical_Møøse","2017-07-24T14:56:44.43Z","One of the best brick-built creatures.","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing special or notable, push tabs on the box, instuctions are ordinary stapled ones, left loose in box.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set includes two fantastic minifigures, a diver, Jeff Fisher, and a guardian in the form of a barracuda apparently, though to me it looks more like an angler fish, which would suit the set better. The latter is the far more interesting of the two, as the head appears in only one other set, City of Atlantis. It&#39;s made of a rubbery sort of plastic that TLG often seems to use for some hairpieces and animals, and it slots on to the torso fine. Despite the fact that the head covers most of the torso, it still has a detailed print.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The diver however, should not be overlooked and his suit is brand new for the second wave of Atlantis. Unlike the first wave, this one features yellow highlights rather than lime green. His torso and legs are covered in mechanical details and look great.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a good variety of uncommon parts, most notable of which are the earth green dragon wings and the speckled gold helmet, as well as the curved covers which make up the sides of the fish. The wings and cover are in this colour exclusive to this set, and indeed there are a fair few pieces which come in uncommon colours here, so it may be well worth picking up for that.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>While fairly easy, it makes good use of SNOT for the sides of the fish, and is quite satisfying to construct. There are several stickers to apply, and this may be a source of annoyance to some, especially on the body of the fish, but are not really necessary for the overall look of the model.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a great looking model overall, and having the small ruin and scooter certainly add to it, and you can feel that an effort has been made with them. The bulbous eyes are quite fun, and the snapping mechanism works well, though the fangs are prone to falling off. I&#39;m not to keen on the top fins, which look a bit out of place, or the tail, which for some reason rotates around a pin. It could have been mounted on a hinge to move realistically, which would have made more sense. It dwarfs the only previous angler, released a good four years earlier.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>The price per piece ratio is bang on average, and I think it&#39;s well worth the RRP in the US, though here it&#39;s a bit pricier, being only &pound;18.99 compared to $19.99 pre-Brexit. It definitely looks the part on display, and the smaller models add something to it.&nbsp;Overall, a nice purchase to make.</p>

"Sobel","2020-05-08T17:08:22.127Z","Now this critter deserves the title ""JAWS""!","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
Despite the VERY odd look of this fish, the set is quite interesting regarding design, functions and playability.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The fish is made up largely of green bricks. The side fins are the same parts as the dragon wings from old castle sets! Several medium and large fangs are included, as well as a golden one. The golden treasure chest holds some gems and a piece of atlantean armor. There are seven stickers in this set, four for the fish and three for the scooter.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two minifigures are included in this set: a scientist diver with &quot;Janus-head&quot; and the yellow gear of the newer sets and an anglerfish-like atlantean guard with Trident. The diver also has a harpoon and a camera which can both be attached to the small scooter.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple, straightforward build. The scooter and the small patch of ground are assembled first, then the anglerfish is built by starting with the internal structure. The sides, jaws, eyes and fins are attached after the main body is finished. Really, nothing too complicated.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set consists of three parts: the scooter, the patch of ground and the fish itself.<br />
The scooter is a simple, stream-lined device for fast underwater travelling. It has a place to hold the harpoon and a small arm to hold the camera. From the handle in the back the diver can still reach the harpoon.<br />
The sea floor piece holds a lopsided pillar, some seaweed and a large treasure chest. The chest holds the goal of the diver, an antique piece of atlantean armor. It also serves as a place to put the atlantean guard on.<br />
The fish itself is very bulky and massive. The lower jaw can be opened and closed, like with the shark-set of this series. The massive teeth do really resemble an actual anglerfish, and so does the &quot;rod&quot; hanging from its forehead. The eyes can also be moved slightly, be this intended or not. The side and back fins can also be moved a little, the back one only in a rotational manner.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While I stated in another review, that I&#39;m not really a fan of buildable creatures, this evil critter is on another level. It&#39;s design, being quite odd, is absolutely on point and bears a strong resemblance to an actual anglerfish. The gigantic teeth look really impressive and Doc with his scooter is best of not coming near them. And the gold tooth? That&#39;s really a good one! Looks like the Atlanteans have dentists for their beast slaves! The big, googly eyes and the &quot;rod&quot; with the flippers on top&nbsp;are also a strange sight, but fitting. The scale-stickers on the flanks are a good addition to the design.&nbsp;<br />
The scooter and the patch of sea floor give a nice touch to this set. This is something I liked in particular about the newer sets (yellow design) of this series: the sets have some small extra parts for more authenticity and playability. The design of the atlantean guard is awesome and the scooter has everything you need for exploration.<br />
But there is one big thing, that REALLY bugs me. It&#39;s the tail fin of the anglerfish. Instead of moving sideways, like a normal fin would, it... rotates. Like a propeller... Huh??? What? Does that mean, the fish is a robot? That stumped me. Also, the anglerfish can&#39;t stand up straight. It always leans to one side. These points kept me from giving it full five stars.&nbsp;<br />
But still, a set with some playability, nice parts and funny, yet impressive design. Definitely a must-have addition for every underwater-world!</p>
