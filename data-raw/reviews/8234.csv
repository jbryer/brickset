<p><em>where I wanna be</em></p>
<p><em>she may be!</em></p>
<p>Donovan keeps on singing in my mind, when I look at this Atlantis-must-have!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pro 1</strong> NEW COLUMN PARTS ""Brick, Round 2 x 2 with Grille""&nbsp;- 83 white ones plus 19 tan makes a total of&nbsp;more than&nbsp;100! 
<li><strong>Pro 2</strong>&nbsp;The 2 divers are somewhat steampunky - I wish, TLG would move more into that e.g. the under-water-boat could have a Nemo/Nautilus/Steampunk color scheme - the design is already alright 
<li><strong>Pro 3</strong> Monster-minifigs, which are a little bit scary and funny as well (right for kids) - they&nbsp;remind me of the movie 'Monsters, Inc.' 
<li><strong>Pro 4</strong> The giant crab has claws which actually work and look good - smart design! And its red eyes keep watching you all the time 
<li><strong>Pro&nbsp;5</strong> The temple&nbsp;simply looks great for display&nbsp;with all the golden parts on it - very elegant columns - and&nbsp;it is great&nbsp;for playing&nbsp;with lots of traps (as usual) 
<li><strong>Pro 6</strong> Flexible weeds add a certain under-water-touch 
<li><strong>Pro&nbsp;7</strong>&nbsp;All-golden Neptune/Poseidon-minifig looks absolutely drop-dead devine and has a godly appearance(-mechanism) in the temple</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Con 1</strong> The giant crab does not fit into the room under the temple as proposed in a picture without removing its legs - It looks better on the roof anyways 
<li><strong>Con 2</strong> The appearance-mechanism has one flaw: The floor rises, but stays on Neptunes/Poseidons&nbsp;helmet ajar&nbsp;(without help from the almighty finger) - naah! <br/>If one builds a small wall at the back of temple connected to the rising piece of floor, the weight of the wall will make the floor flip into a vertical position&nbsp;at a certain bent - easy to improve, be a little bit creative!

"incrediblehulk","2011-05-10T15:36:10.007Z","Definition of an awesome set","<p>I got my first set 18 years ago, but until now, my biggest set was 6075 Wolfpack tower. Recently, I fell in love with Atlantis theme and started saving up. Then I saw a nice discount on this (45€ as opposed to 70€ listing) and got it.<br></p><br><h4>Parts</h4>Aside from the insanely awesome column bricks (more than a hundred of them), there are lots of useful and uncommon parts. I couldn't stop imagining the houses that I can build with the pieces of this set. There are 6 golden tridents as a bonus. Would have been really really nice if they have just included a base plate.<br><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I've already had the barracuda warrior from 7978 Angler Attack, but I don't mind a second one of course. But the crab warrior is slightly cooler than him :) Diver minifigures are the standard Atlantis divers, no surprise here, but again, yellow suits are very very cool, I prefer them to the neon green ones. And lastly, the Poseidon(?) statue, a good candidate for collector's items.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Due to lack of a base plate, it requires a little attention, other than that quite straightforward, but fun. If you are on a flat surface, it won't require extra effort.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Looks more and more awesome than the pictures, including the picture on the box. I am not much of a player anymore, but the statue mechanism is quite good (although a little hard to use). The side models, vehicle and the crab also look good. Actually I ws already impressed how the vehicle looks before starting to build the temple.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Normal European price is a little high (70€) but if you see any discount, get it without any doubt. Either displaying or using the pieces for other builds, this is one of the best sets I've ever seen. Can't wait to convert this into a above-water Greek temple, or building some nice neo-classic houses.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Lint","2012-06-18T06:56:13.31Z","So much more than meets the eye","<p>The City of Atlantis is hands down the most beautiful looking sets of the Atlantis line of 2011. Unforunately poor pricing and very bad marketing on the box makes it look a lot smaller, simplistic and underwhelming than it actually is. The set includes five minifigures: a golden sea-king, two superbly crafted sea monsters (angler-fishman and crab man) and two Atlantis explorers. The architecture of this set is based on ancient greek culture with the main structure resembling the Parthenon. The gimmicks of this set are a golden gated dungeon, swinging axe over the entrance, a trap door and the elevator mechanism for the golden king reveal. Also included are a black brick-built lobster and the explorer's double armed submarine.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Excellent build experience. While the box art seems to depict the city as a rather simple affair with really lame gimmicks, the actual build of the main structure is a joy and the gimmicks, for the most part, are well inspired. I cannot stress how enjoyable this build was.<br></li><li>Excellent parts and lots of them. Lots of tridents, golden fish, seaweed, golden gates. The column parts are so good I almost feel like buying a second set to make the 'temple' three dimensional. This is a great set to butcher for ancient themed MOC's<br></li><li>Excellently sculpted Atlantean minifigures and brick-built lobster. No expense was spared to make these awesome. The fishman and crabman are standouts.</li><li>Overall a very beautiful looking set to look at. I enhanced mine with power functions lighting which really sets the mood.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Fishman minifig generally cannot stand up straight unless standing on a baseplate.<br></li><li>The main elevator gimmick, while well inspired, doesn't function perfectly. I don't know whether or not this is my fault for not quite building it properly but the mechanism seems to struggle to produce the torque required to push the golden king out from under. Also the flip-up throne-room plate doesn't seem to have anything there to hold it up straight after it has been pushed up.</li><li>Black lobster doesn't actually fit too well inside the golden gates.<br></li><li>I would have preferred that more bricks be dedicated to the City of Atlantis itself instead of giving us another red submarine yet again.</li><li>Initial pricing was horrendous for this set which is why I have seen them linger on the shelves. I got this heavily discounted and even then, only consider it a 'fair' price.<br></li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>This set is a must for any Lego fan due to the sheer number of interesting parts and minifigures plus the excellent build experience. Even if you are not a collector of the Atlantis lineI would recommend that you consider picking it up if it is still floating around your local store on clearance.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,3
"braycraft","2011-06-24T02:15:16.077Z","Potential","<p>This set has a TON of potential.&nbsp; I recommend buying it; however, I also recommend not including ANY of the green weeds, plants, anything like that.&nbsp; I removed those from my set, adn it looks like a prestine Greek temple.&nbsp; This is a theme Lego NEEDS to come out with.&nbsp; They need to test a Greek/Roman theme like they did with Vikings.&nbsp; The first taste of what that could be like came from this set plus the Spartan minifigures.&nbsp; Add this set, minus the plants and seaweed, plus the Spartans, an you have yourself an Ancient Greek city building.&nbsp; The underwater Atlantis feel takes away from this set's potential.&nbsp; This is absolutely a BEAUTIFUL set just as white and gold.&nbsp; Again, leave out the plants for the cleanist looking Lego set they may have EVER produced.</p>

"Ernst","2012-05-13T12:27:24.053Z","Greek Mythology under water.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : Great set with many possibilities. I&#39;m not charmed with the Atlantis theme but this set is really nice. I bought it because of the building, an ancient Greece temple, but it is a good set in total with&nbsp;nice minifigures and accesoires. The set has great parts which I want to use for a Greek/Roman Temple and looks great when finished with all good working traps. Most of all I love it because it&#39;s for me the inspiration and the base to built a real Greek Temple.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks </strong>: First to built are the minifigures, nice figures really. One a diver with propellor, a normal diver, King Poseidon and 2 Atlantis habitants. Then the huge krab and the small submarine, both very nice results. Then the built of the Temple with the left and right ground parts and the&nbsp;mechanism to lift the Poseidon statue. A clever part with a lot of Technic parts and works very well and&nbsp;then the pillars on which the first floor is based. The right floor has a trap hatch and a great looking golden fence down on the left side. Center is open and is covered by a wall part with nice stickers as background that rises for the &quot;Poseidon disclosure&quot;. After that again the built of 6 pillars on which you built the great looking front of the Temple, the best part of the set by far ! Great use of known small accesoires and surprise for me was the use of what normally is the roof or hood of a car in the center of the front. Than you built the stairs with a mechanism that connects with the &quot;Poseidon surprise&quot;. And finally the entrance toward the temple with some broken pillars and a small temple entrance with a trap; a spear falling down. In total great fun to built this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong> : definitly a set filled with great parts, I will just name some I like most. Of course the great amount of 2x2 round bricks, the gold parts suchs a the fence, the ornament fishes, the tridents&nbsp;and the 1x1 round plates. The Poseidon minifigure is awesome, the other Atlantis&nbsp;minifigures are good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability&nbsp;4 bricks</strong> : I&#39;m not the playing type but my 6 year old son showed me the great playabilty, he had a lot of fun with it for days. Nothing exceptional but good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value&nbsp;4 bricks</strong> : not cheap but affordable is my opinion certainly if you see all the great parts and possibilities the sets offers. Used price some &euro;40,00 which is a decent price for a good 700 parts set.</p>

"Fauch","2015-06-03T18:40:56.337Z","Nice looking, some design flaws.","<p>Parts</p>

<p>Nice parts here, lots of white, tons of round bricks with grille, also many seaweed (including large green flammes and some very rare orange plants), also some rare golden gates and fishes.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures lack prints a bit as only divers get backprinting on torsos, in another hand, there are some great molds for the heads, with hole for attaching horns or other stuff. The king has a golden and a human bearded face which is quite nice as well as an exclusive helmet. he looks&nbsp;quite shiny. It is a bit disappointing that the armor and helmet don&#39;t have the same texture.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite simple, but includes a bit of technic. The submodels bring a bit of variety. building the columns is slightly repetitive but doesn&#39;t take really long.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is of average size, I believe 28 x 32 studs. the temple is over 20 cm high I think. It&#39;s quite a beautiful model, though the sub builds don&#39;t really bring much in that area.</p>

<p>It comes with a ton of play features, unfortunately, not all well executed. The submarine comes with arms on ball joints and can catch stuffs, on the other hand, the flick missiles are very poorly done and difficult to shoot. The lobster is ok, but can&#39;t really grab anything in its claws. The temple has decent play features overall. an axe falls from the entrance but is poorly dissimulated, then a column can fall too. There is a trapdoor which works fine (though makes little sense underwater). Flick missiles in the roof feel a bit out of place, fortunately they aren&#39;t obvious from the front. The best feature is the king rising from the floor as you turn the key. It works well, though it can vary if you use other minifigs. It seems the king helmet helps quite a bit. If you use it a few times in a row, the king will eventually get knocked down.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Nice looking set with many play features ranging from terrible to good. Price seems a little bit high, battle of alamut retailed for 10&euro; more, and while they both take the same space, battle of alamut has far more walls. Also, in a very similar style, but different theme, I suggest getting scorpion pyramid over this set.</p>

"Sobel","2020-06-02T21:31:18.473Z","An architectonic masterpiece with some really cool minifigures!","<p>With all the Corona stuff going on, I find myself with some time on my hands to re-build and review some of my older sets. Now, with this series being some 9-10 years old, it is not really THAT old, at least in my eyes.<br />
This set is quite outstanding judging by its design. It is the first and only set I know, that resembles an ancient Greek temple complete with pillars, capitals and tomb/altar. On top of that, it has a lot of functions, minifigures and more to offer. Personally, I don&#39;t like the &quot;dollhouse&quot;-design that much, but let&#39;s have some details.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are not really that much special parts to this set. Obviously, a lot of white parts for the temple, especially the round bricks for the pillars (102 all in all!!!), baseplates, gears&nbsp;and white bricks for the rest of the temple. The only special parts come with the small submartine, those being the ball joints for the claw-arms. A treasure chest with some gems is included, as well as an atlantean mystic disc and several parts in the nice-looking gold colour. Also of interest might be the green &quot;plant&quot; pieces, which are originally flames, so yeah, cool recycling! Two green tentacles serve as large pieces of seagrass. The set contains nine stickers, which really isn&#39;t that much, given the number of pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Five minifigures are included, which is a fair amount for a set this size. We have two divers in yellow gear, a male and a female one. Both have two-sided heads, the male a frightened, the female a determined one. The male explorer has an oversized propeller-backpack with lights and wields a harpoon. The female diver serves as pilot for the small sub and also has a harpoon at her disposal.<br />
On the other side stand two atlantean guards and the King of Atlantis! We already knew the anglerfish-like guardian with his large fangs, but this set introduces an extremely cool looking little fella, who seems to have a lobster in his line of ancestors. He has the immobile legs of kid-minifigures but two large pincers attached to the normal hands. A large head with several extensions completes the cool design. The Atlantean king is clad in gold and has a two-sided head, one bearing the face of an old man with grey beard and neutral look and the other one being a more ghost-like, red-eyed grimace with an angry look. All atlanteans wield the usual tridents.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The diver&#39;s backpack, the black crab-like monster and the small sub are built first. E.Z. Next, the lower part of the temple itself is put together, including the tomb-rising mechanism for the king. This part might require some more attention since everything has to come in place the right way. Also, in the earlier stages, the whole construction is a little unstable, so a solid base to build on is recommended (e.g. table...).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
The construction of the pillars and roof is very repetitive, as is are the stairs. Here, the rest of the gear-mechanism is added, so focus. The final stretch covers the entrance way and the decorative plants. So, all in all, not a difficult build, I&#39;d rather say a little annoying here and there...</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Another piece of underwater scenery, this time, with an impressive architectonic monument of atlantean culture. The realistic design of the temple speaks for itself, the plants and sea weed add to this effect. The building also holds several interesting functions.<br />
The entrance with the archway has a hidden guillotine, that can be triggered by pushing the golden stud that sticks out on the arch. The large pillar on the right of the alley can be pushed over, be this a trap or rather a consequence of old age.<br />
At the bottom of the stairs is a stone tablet where the atlantean disc has to be placed in order to turn the tablet and have the King of Atlantis rise from his tomb. This happens via several gears that lift the small platform he stands on and have him push open the large white piece with the brick-pattern sticker. The left side of the temple holds the treasure chest and on the lower area a small cell, maybe for the crab-creature. On the right wing of the temple is a trap-door for getting rid of&nbsp;unsuspecting visitors. The front of the roof holds two (useless) flip-torpedoes of sorts.<br />
There are two additional pieces to this set, first the black crab-thing with odd red eyes and large claws. It has six legs a mysterious pattern on the back. The other extra is a small, but sturdy submarine. In fact, this is the second-largest submarine of the newer generation of this series! It has two large claw-arms, spotlights, useless flip-torpedoes and an oversized propeller in the back. The cockpit can be opened and the arms move freely in all directions.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While I&#39;m not so fond of the coulisse-like design with the open back and unfinished look, this set still comes out as a pretty nice piece of scenery and architecture. All the plants and pieces of rubble that&nbsp;are scattered over the place make it look quite realistic. The ornaments and golden decorations add nicely to the looks&nbsp;of the temple. This set has great presentation value, maybe when put in some kind of aquarium with dark blue background and sand on the ground. Add some indirect lighting and you get a nice display case.&nbsp;<br />
Furthermore, the play value is even more increased by the additional things that come with this set, meaning the crab and the submarine. Though the design of the crab is mighty odd, the sub looks cool and both these things give even more opportunities and help incorporate this set in the greater picture of the series.<br />
I already listed all the different functions of the set earlier, so now to some little flaws, as usual. Again, there are some things in the design that stumped me. As mentioned before, the crab-creature looks VERY odd. Also, the propeller-pack for the male diver is WAY too oversized, the guy can&#39;t even stand upright! There&#39;s also one MAJOR flaw in the main function of the set. When you turn the stone with the disc on it, it tends to be very stiff and needs a lot of force to be turned. I think that is because of the small gears underneath the stone which have to transmit the power immediately to some quite large gears. That way, it might be a little difficult to bring up the King from his tomb. Also, the entrance way is a little unstable and tends to break apart when the model is lifted.<br />
Despite this, this set scores in design, playability and it&#39;s minifigures. Definitely a recommendation and an awesome addition to the Atlantis series!</p>
