<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 can be added to the current Kingdoms set and blends in quite nicely<br></li><li>Pro 2 lots of pieces for the price, lots of basic pieces, lots of customization</li><li>Pro 3 Minifig matches the Kingsdoms minifigs</li><li>Pro 4 Door and windows really make it shine</li><li>Pro 5 Lots of castle colors vs the previous starter castle set which was yellow, that didnt really fit in with all the other castle sets.</li><li>Pro 6 Cool alternate builds on the box is inspiring</li><li>Pro 7 many extra pieces</li><li>Pro 8 with a lot left to the imagination, there's lots of playability for kids with the customizable dragon<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 The 'dragon' is interesting and creative but ultimately goofy looking<br></li><li>Con 2 Too bad they dont have enough pieces to build the horse with the default build<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I think its a great way to introduce your kids to the castle series, great bang for the buck. I didnt like the dragon so i turned him into a piece of furniture instead. With the small amount of castle sets out at this time, this set is a quick fix until the newer sets come out. I've actually attached it to my Outpost Attack (7948) and it practically feels like they were meant to be together with its matching color schemes and minifigs. Overall, I was impressed with this build.&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
"Sauron_Bauglir","2012-05-23T17:15:24.427Z","A Great Set for Small Children","<p>This set is very good for small children. Maybe not if you are my age (14). Below are the Pros and Cons:</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great parts: 2 keys, a gem, a few other good bits.</li><li>Useful figure for your Lion Knight Army.</li><li>Very nice wall section.</li><li>Good horse and cart for a farm.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Not very good value for money.</li><li>The dragon is pathetic.</li><li>Not very good for people my age (14).</li></ul>
<p>This set is generally good for the parts, and expanding your Lion Kingdom. Recommended for the ages of 4-8.</p>",TRUE,2,2,3,2,3
"Jerreke","2012-01-09T03:51:06.23Z","great play-set for children","<p>at a sale in a larger discount-shop i purchased this set for a very small price (€6). I bought it for my 3-year old who loves playing with his dad's Lego ;). He also has a nice range of Duplo but those little bricks are more attractive to him ;-)</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>nice little building + kart</li><li>the dragon is ideal for smaller children, despite it's goofy nature to adults. For a 3-year old it's a roaring dragon :)</li><li>box-art shows different buildings</li><li>nice parts</li><li>key for door! Children love this detail!</li><li>leftovers can be used for pimping the building, or constructing a bird (e.g.)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>no real horse for the kart</li><li>not much room in building for minifig</li></ul>
<p>in short: nice set for the younger people playing with Lego.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Ernst","2012-06-27T14:02:08.48Z","Great for kids (and AFOLS).","<p>Overall 5 bricks : I write this both as parent and AFOL. This is a real nice set for kids, my 6 year old son loves Lego and esspecially (like all boys) if he can fight and make adventures. And that is what this set offers, a knight with sword, a small Castle and loads of other possibilities and for a real fair price. And for the AFOL 144 usefull bricks to borrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building&nbsp;4 bricks : The instructions show how to built a cute small Castle with dragon but the fun starts when the kid starts to make his own designs and this set has all the content for it. The shown castle is even for a grown-up fun to built (yes I did).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts&nbsp;4 bricks : Looking at the parts as AFOL this is a great set with nothing but usefull parts for Castle MOC's, a nice minifigure, wheels, a door with 2 keys&nbsp;and&nbsp; 2 windows. The only thing you miss is a horse, that would have made it even more perfect.&nbsp;Be good to your kid and maybe parents can borrow some.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks : A kid can have hours of fun with the content of this set and so can we !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : For a nice price of €7,99 you get a good minifigure and some 140 other good parts. I might even consider to buy another box for myself just for the parts, really a good deal.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
