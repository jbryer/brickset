I&nbsp;compare this set to the other small sets from&nbsp;these series and I must say it is the best. It's the smaller brother of the Road Construction set. For a&nbsp;decent price (app. 10 Euro) you get a great variety of tiles&nbsp;including a shovel, a jackhammer, a small bulldozer bucket and many more uncommon tiles. The vehicles apper a little bit too small and disproportional but remember this is a&nbsp;tiny basic set so don't expect too much details :-) On the Lego homepage you'll find additional building instructions for this set, for example for a six-wheel bulldozer which IMHO is the best model in the set. </p>
<p>This is a must have for all Bricks and more series fans.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
