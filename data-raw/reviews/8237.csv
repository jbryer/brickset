Personally, that is all right, because someone would buy this as an introduction to legos, then they could fill it with whatever new sets they get. But to my surprise, everything is packed full! And the basic bricks that I bought the set for were all neatly contained within one bag. The other peices were in a different bag, with smaller peices in a very small bag on their own. The idea book is alright, a nice little handicap to help new builders, which this set is directed towards.<br><br>This set has a set of archs, a windsheild, some transparent peices, a pair of wheels, some axles, a minifigure, and many basic bricks. It has some great variety, but what I wanted it for was the basic bricks. And their are plently of them. Many more than I thought there would be. For a first time lego buyer, this set is perfect. Just be sure to eventually get them a bigger box, and many more sets to fill it with!<br><br>The playibility is astounding. As with all brick buckets (some of the best lego sets) you can build anything, create any senario, decide who triumphs! It is amazing how many playable things there are. You can simply build, or crete a microscale city, maybe make&nbsp; a bomber plane, a car shop, a hurricane rescue squad. ANYTHING. Just tell that to the new lego fan you got this for and it will be their favorite set. Then in the future, when they have more minifigs, more peices, and maybe a few themed sets, the battles can be bigger, the mocs larger and so forth.<br><br>To be honest, this is probably one of the best sets released this year. In 2011, one of the best years in lego. Thats a big award. Plus the price is just right. A bulk set of bricks like this should be cheap, as to attract a wary buyer as to whether or not getting into legos is a good hobby. I actually would like to get another one of these, for the basic bricks to build houses and such with. A great variety, great peices, a minifigure, whats not to like. This will compliment anyones lego collection perfectly. If you are a collector, who builds and displays your sets, I defeintly reccomend buying this so you can see its much more fun playing and creating with your imagination. I have reccomended this to a friend, and would like to thank you for reading my review!<br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5
