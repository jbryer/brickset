"jonnytheagent","2019-08-07T21:02:53.087Z","Good parts for little price","<p>Here is my review for the set:</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Good Parts like the rims in yellow or the 2 x 2 bricks in medium blue</li>
	<li>3 good builds to play with</li>
	<li>Alternate builds</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
	<li>There are 3 vehicles but only 2 Minifigures</li>
	<li>I think for a airport building set you need an actual airport building</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall ,this is a good set to play and if you are bored of the original construction, you can build something new from the bricks.</p>
