"Duq","2011-01-17T14:47:25.977Z","Minimalism on the Moon","<p>Here's an odd little set. It's a moon buggy in the City line. The driver/astronaut comes with a cap and a lunar helmet. I guess it's an exploration buggy with a drill on the back and a satellite dish for beaming back data.</p><p>The design is very minimal; a 2x8 plate with three sets of wheels under and a steering wheel and 4x4 inverted slope on top. Then there's a couple of robot arms and a torso for the drill and two cheese graters and a red handle for decoration. All in all there's 33 parts and that includes 6 wheels and 6 tires...</p><p>For playability it's good to have the option of using it 'on earth' or 'on the moon'. The drill arm can move but it easily comes off when it's played with.</p><p>For the 4 pounds I paid it's decent value, costing twice as much as the collectable figs.</p><p>It's no impressive design but it certainly makes a nice treat to bring home for a child.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3

"David1971","2011-02-27T16:33:08.307Z","Nice little thing...","<p>With the little LEGO sets, I always like them more than I expect. This is a good example. On the one hand, there's not much to it. I knew not to expect too much. It's an 8x2 plate with some wheels and some bits on. But actually - it's nice!</p><p>I got it for the great price of £3.19 in Tesco (UK) - that's in their 20 per cent off all toys promotion. And for three pounds it's a wonderful thing. It's nippy. It's got six wheels. And it's got a moveable digging/drilling bit of machinery. And of course, you get a nice astronaut, with a choice of blue cap or space helmet. This was a new kind of space helmet, to me, and quite grand. And I really, really like the fact that there is room to carry the helmet on the buggy.<br></p><p>It certainly is puzzling that the 2011 space sets are part of 'LEGO City'. This seems like something that maybe would only be of concern to AFOLs, but during the 5 minutes I spent looking at the sets in a toy shop the other day, two little boys became engaged in an argument with each other about the implications of this, one seeming to say that they weren't space sets at all and that they were just spacey-looking city vehicles (or something).</p><p>Even for me, in this particular case it makes me wonder if this is not a moon buggy, which I think it is, and maybe it's a kind of Earth-bound research buggy, or something for astronauts to move about in near the launch pad. But no, it's a moon buggy, isn't it. (*Looks again at box*) Actually the box shows it clearly being on Earth, with a city skyline in the background. And of course, the 'LEGO City' logo. Hmmm, see, it's confusing!!</p><p>But let's ignore all that and say it's a moon buggy. Well, it's a nice one. And the fact that it's not bulky or complex is actually *realistic* since actual moon buggies had to be simple and lightweight, as they - to state the obvious - had to get them to the moon! See the Apollo one at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Roving_Vehicle - there's not much to it.</p><p>So, this is a nice little set, and will very nicely compliment set #3366, 'Satellite Launch Platform', which I also acquired recently and am looking forward to building!<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

	i bought this set at a local toy store, it was dirt-cheap and the minifig has a nice helmet.</p>

<p>
	nice little set, but could be made better (eg. wheelfenders, storage for drilled moonrocks,...) with some spare parts. The extra parts might improve play-ability.</p>

"Snowtrooper119","2011-11-21T04:32:00.64Z","Review of space moon buggy","<p>This is another one&nbsp;of those great impulse sets. You just see it on the shelf, you think ""hey, that looks cool"" and then it ends up at the checkout. Well as far as impulse sets go this is pretty good. This set is the cheapest way to get one of those shiny new astronauts with the cool space pack. The astronaut has a reasonably detailed torso showing suitable details such as the space logo even though this is a City set but the best part is the really cool space pack with the dull gold visor. The spaceman also has a blue hat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The actual space buggy has very little to it other than the six wheels and the chainsaw arm at the back which are both nice features. It doesn't matter that it is relatively sparce because the features included make up for it, also the buggy has a special spot for the space pack on it&nbsp;. If you see this on the shelf it would be worth buying because it is just a great little impulse buy that is pretty good for 37 pieces. A good buy and it is very cheap.&nbsp;I recommend it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5
"Graysmith","2011-12-31T09:24:46.17Z","A Bit of Space Nostalgia","It's so nice to see LEGO going back into space just as the explorers they were in the Classic Space era. I believe a huge part of why Classic Space is as beloved as it is has to do with that fact that it was more reality-based rather than full of guns and aliens like most of what followed. These new space sets honour what Classic Space was all about, and if you're not looking to get any of the bigger sets you really can't go wrong with this moon buggy. Heck, I'd say this moon buggy is actually the one you really should get out of all of them since it is most akin to the many small lunar vehicles of Classic Space (like <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=886-1"">886</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=889-1"">889</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6841-1"">6841</a>).<div><br></div><div>It's not much of a build (as with most of these small sets), there aren't any amazing parts or anything, but it's a really lovely throwback to the Classic Space era and a must-own if you're a fan of LEGO's most iconic theme.</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
