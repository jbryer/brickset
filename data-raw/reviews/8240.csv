"Basingstoke_01","2011-02-12T06:24:56.607Z","Some interesting new features with a good price point","<p>This set consists of a tracker van with a portable computer desk and a rocket with a launch platform and spare satellite. </p>
<p>The van and the launch platform come in separate bags in the box for easy part sorting. The launch platform is basic, but does have a moveable gantry. </p>
<p>The van is the best part of this set. It has the same wheel base size as the K9 police unit released this year, but has a larger body, so you could use it a family car. It has a fold down black plate and a space for the portable computer desk. Due to the parts used the desk slides in easily and does not rattle about in place. The van has a fold down satellite dish on the roof. </p>
<p>The computer desk is one of the best control stations that Lego have yet produced. Unlike previous computers which were a single piece with dials and buttons. This unit has stand for the screen, a separate screen and a piece that looks like a standard QWERTY keyboard, right down to the distinctive shape of the enter and shift buttons, although the computer does use a piece that looks like a coffee mug. I am not sure what this is supposed to be.</p>
<p>The one oddity is the extra satellite. It does not seem to fit in with the rest of the set, for example their is no place to store it, it just sits on the ground. </p>
<p>Finally the stickers used in this set are reminiscent of the old space logo, a nice touch.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"United_Bricks","2011-02-20T14:57:06.567Z","Awsome space set","I got this from agros for Â£13.99, This set is really worth the money. You get one minifigure with this set, he is the mechanic. The set has eight stickers but they make the set even better. The lego space line is in corporation with N.A.S.A. <br><br><h4>THE MECHANIC<br></h4>The mechanic is a decent minifig. He has a blue base ball cap, a sort of new head but has been in other sets recently. He has glasses on his head and a smiling face. His torso is only one sided, the torso is the same as the repair truck sets. His pants are blue.&nbsp; OVERALL 3/5<br><br><h4>MOBILE DESk</h4><p>The mobile desk has a red ordinary cup it also has a printed keyboard and a new printed computer screen, which is very good design. Also on the desk their is a leaver and a red stud. The desk slides into the van very easily, which is good for storage uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OVERALL 5/5</p><p><br></p><h4>THE SATELLITE AND THE STAND</h4><p>THE SATELLITE<br></p><p>The satellite is a good design, their is two tops for the satellite. They are both the same design except one has the satellite already out for when it is in space and the other is when it on the ground. The ground top has no satellite coming out. All you do to change them is pull one of the rocket and replace it with the other top. Both tops has two logos on each side, The logo is a space rocket in space. The satellite things on one of the tops are stickers on a piece sadly, but they are still cool. OVERALL 4/5</p><p>THE STAND FOR THE SATELLITE</p><p>The stand makes the satellite even better. What you do is you put the rocket is the hole on the stand then you pull down the satellite holder thing and then blast off. One of the brilliant features of the stand is that you can pull down the satellite holder. OVERALL 4/5</p><p><br></p><h4>THE REPAIR VAN</h4><p>The van is a nice van, with lots of good things. The van has two stickers on it. On the top of the van their is a satellite dish, which you can lift up when in use and put down when not in use. The satellite dish a good design. At the back of the van their is a door what you pull down to open. on the door is a sticker, the sticker is a number plate and a red and whit caution sign. Inside the van you can slide the mobile desk into the van, I think that was a good feature. The van has been made brilliant. OVERALL 5/5</p><p><br></p><h4>OVERALL</h4><p>I thought this set was brilliant. Inside the instructions their is a couple facts about space. I thought this was a brilliant set, so I would give this set a 21/25.</p><p>(Please read me other reviews Legoboy2345678)&nbsp; <br></p><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<h4>Price</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its pretty cheap for a kinda' big set. For 165 pieces I recommend the approriate price should be around $20-$27 USD instead of $19 USD but for most of you out there a price mistake which in the case of when a price is slightly inapproriate [too cheap] for a big set we are happy:&gt;</p>

It is great and Im planning to make a LEGO stopmotion&nbsp;series&nbsp;entitled ""Space Story"".</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>

<h4>Instruction</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing new but a ""Do You Know"" question and answers relating to NASA [LEGO is in collaboration with NAS so thet these sets exist] near the advertisement pages. No mistakes but you may think this as a mistake: The part where it tells you to apply 1 sticker on the satellite and the rocket top but when you finished building it you will see 2 remaining stickers the same as the one on the satellite and rocket top, it is supposed to go to the opposite site of where the 1st and 2rd stickers are placed in the rocket top and the satellite.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its great and cheap, buy this when its around!</p>

"win_poo","2012-07-25T17:40:47.907Z","Not a strong structural set","<p>My 4-yr-old Lego enthusiast got this for his birthday, and I watched him follow the direction and build the entire set with minimal help. &nbsp;It is suggested that one part of the roof can be taken off to play the minifigure inside. &nbsp;Because of this, the roof of the car is structurally unsound and can easily fall off. &nbsp;I think it would have been better to have hinges instead if the top was meant to open and shut.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4
