"williamwolves","2011-02-21T17:44:28.1Z","""Houston, this is Sleek Shuttle, we have lift off...""","<p>After hearing the words; Space, NASA and 2011 I knew I couldn't wait. Lego was a genius to revive the earth based space theme: Space shuttle, rover, and Apollo like rockets. I had just gotten my birthday money and as usual went with my family over to Toy's R Us. I went straight to the Lego aisle and all I saw was the space shuttle box glowing in all of its glory. After grabbing the last one I set to work.</p>
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;This set was not too hard to build and was a great experience. It took about an hour but it was fun none the less.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;It's a space shuttle! You just&nbsp;can go wrong with that.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Cool golden helmet. It is the same from Atlantis except it's not a trans visor.(A little big but not impossibly obtrusive.)</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Double sided minifig torso's are always welcome.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Unique nosecone design. Still the same from the blue plane but with a pre-painted black tip.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;The instruction booklet had lots of facts on the real space shuttle at the end of the build.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;WHY DID LEGO USE STICKERS?&nbsp;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;The lone spaceman. He's all alone. Lego should have made the shuttle a little bigger to accommodate at least one more passenger like the previous Lego space shuttles and the hatches are also tough to close and open.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;The hatches are really rickety and although they stay closed, they rattle quite a bit.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;The landing gear isn't retractable&nbsp;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;It can&rsquo;t be set up standing on the thrusters since the fin in the back sticks off the edge over the thrusters.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Fixes:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Stow a fellow astronaut into the back with a little&nbsp;rearranging.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;You&nbsp;could&nbsp;put a long two by twelve flat brick over the hatches to stop the&nbsp;rattling.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;You can take the landing gear off or stick the back to wheels onto the wings.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Build&nbsp;a small launch pad out of 4509668&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;and make a clamp and add some extra stuff and the shuttle can stand up on it's own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I will definitely be recommending this set to many more people. I am glad Lego joined forces with NASA. In the end, the cons I found were mostly minor and overlook-able. And the price was reasonable as well. I cant wait for my local Toy's R Us to get a shipment of other 2011 space products.</p>

"TheMikeStrikesBack","2011-04-03T13:03:59.26Z","Fun little shuttle","<p>Well this is one of those sets that kept calling my name in the store because I love the space shuttle, but that I always resisted to buy because it looked small and a bit dumb. Finally, yesterday, I broke down and bought it.</p>
<p>The box contents was about what I expected. Two numbered bags (they are good size bags), instructions, and a sheet of stickers. I was surprised to not find either one bent up. But moving on to the building experience...</p>
<p>This was actually a lot of fun. Starting off with the base, you see the shape of the shuttle come together right at the beginning. It starts off with some big pieces, but seeing as how you're building the wings and base, that can be expected. The rest of the shuttle uses a mix of small and big pieces. The cockpit kind of bugs me though, I wish they would stop using one piece cockpits. I think they could make them more interesting with some more pieces but maybe that's just me... Overall it's pretty fun build and took me about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Now for some things that I found strange about this set. First off is the red. Since when is there red on the space shuttle? I guess they wanted to make it more colorful and appealing for kids or something. There's not a ton, so it doesn't look terrible. Still looks kind of weird though. Second is the fin. Personally I wish there wasn't that 2 x 3 plate at the top and that it had just cut off thin like the real shuttle. It's not a big deal though. I do like the 2 x 8 fin. Third is the yellow robotic arm. But again, I think it's a matter of making it more colorful. Fourth is that I think the back right behind the cargo bay could have been a little better designed, maybe just a couple tiles right under the fin or something. The little circular studs (especially the trans red ones) look weird to me. Fifth are the elevators. They are only two pieces and there is a big gap between them and the wings. I wish they had filled them in somehow. I guess they did it so the elevators could move freely up and down, but I know there are other ways to do that without leaving the gap. Lastly, and probably the thing I found strangest, is the red cup in the cockpit. Really...? Coffee in space...?</p>
<p>After all that, let me tell you what I do like about this set. First I like the size. I thought it seemed small but the size seems perfect to me for playing with it. Not so big that it's hard to carry, but not so small that it has no features. Second is the playability. I like how the elevators can move, the cargo bay opens, the robotic arm comes out, and the satellite attaches to it. The satellite can fold up and be stored in the cargo bay with the robotic arm. In the instructions it shows to detach the satellite from the arm first before putting it in, but I was able to get it all to fit while still leaving the satellite attached. There's even a special little second helmet inside the bay for space walks. Third is the engines. They look really cool. I also think LEGO made a great decision to use those canopy pieces in solid white. They capture the shape really well. Also the ones in this set have the little bar at the end of them which I think is really useful. I also just decided to mention that the nose is printed and not a sticker so that makes me happy. Lastly, and one of my favorite parts, is the landing gear. It's really simple but I think it looks great. It also has that forward tilt that the real shuttle has. I love it.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this is a great set. I was skeptical at first but I'm really glad I bought it. Like the title said, it's a fun little shuttle. Worth the 30 dollars. If you're like me and this set is just calling to you, give in. Buy it. (Or wait for it to go on sale if you don't want to pay 30 dollars. I guess it could have been 25.)</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"legospongepotter","2011-03-13T21:58:53.31Z","""One small step for a Minifigure, one giant leap for Minifigure-kind!"" ","<p>It is definitely a big leap for Lego to have a space them that doesn't include aliens or anything. I just got this today, March 12, 2011, and I am completely impressed. I have three base reasons for being impressed: <br>
-It looks so sleek and it looks really nice on display.<br>
-I can't really play with Lego, no matter how hard I try. This set made it easy.<br>
-There's lots of great features!</p>
<p>&nbsp;So I'm just going to start with the Minifigure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Minifigure:<br>
Legs: You get normal white legs without printing.</p>
<p>Torso: It is again white but it has lots of printing like the NASA symbol, some buttons that might control the space suit, etc. on the back there are some printed tubes to help him breathe. He has gray hands.</p>
<p>Head: I really dislike this head. I am going to change this head without a more suited one. It's that frown with the red glasses. I just don't get why the guy has to be angry. I really hate it in this set and would seriously recommend changing it with a more happy face.</p>
<p>Helmet 1: You get two helmets for this Minifigure. You get a nice white helmet with a clear visor. It kind of looks like a motorcycle helmet. Or if you're familiar with the game 'Halo' then it looks like the Master Chief's Helmet.</p>
<p>Helmet 2: I prefer this one over helmet 1. It's big. In the back there are some air tanks that extend over the back of the Minifigure. Then you get a big golden visor that isn't see-through. It's pretty cool and makes the Minifigure looks cute.</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cockpit:<br>
The cockpit is kind of empty. Inside there is some nice 2x2 slanted pieces with computer screens, and there's a mug there, which is kind of dumb because wouldn't coffee just float out because of zero gravity? The mug sits on the computer. Then there's a blue chair for the Minfiigure. The Minifigure cannot sit properly in there with Helmet 2. Only helmet 1 works. <br>
The top/outer part of the cockpit is pretty nice. At the nose part there is a printed part that looks pretty cool. It has what I think are some engines and some black and gray paint to make it look cool. There's are three blue windows, two small ones and a large one in the middle. They are actually one big window and attach from the inside. On top there are some studs. On both sides there is a sticker which again might be the NASA symbol. It's on either side of the cockpit. This whole thing is one big piece that attaches pretty easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Storage:<br>
The storage area is very nice. The rocket can be pulled open easily so it is very wide and you can see inside. Attached to one end is the yellow robotic arm. It's not an actual arm, but a long part that moves around and pivots at lots of useful angles. At one and is a piece that attaches to the satellite. <br>
The satellite&nbsp; is a great accessory. It is round at the bottom and on top of that there are two transparent blue pieces that can fold up and down so it looks like it's closed or like a real satellite. When closed it fits into the storage area, but open it looks like a satellite. On top of that two little sticks stick out, and this is where the satellite attaches to the robotic arm. On top of that is a round piece with a yellow stud. You can also put Helmet 2 in there and it has this kind of stand thing that holds it. You put the satellite and helmet back in and fold the robotic arm on top and then you can close it up.<br>
When closed, it looks like the middle of a shuttle as it should. There are tons of studs on top for things you need on top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Wings:<br>
The wings are big triangles on top of bigger black triangles. There is a sticker with the NASA symbol and the numbers and letters: JM 3367 (3367 is the set number). Another section of the wing can move up and down. Each wing is identical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Engines:<br>
In the back there is a large rudder piece with the NASA symbol again, and both sides are the same. Then there are these half-circle type pieces that kind of hold in the engines. There are five black circular engines in the back with lots of orange studs. It basically looks like the back of a rocket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Bottom:<br>
On the bottom there are circular smooth gray pieces and a five wheels. The ship leans in the front because of some of the wheels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Overall:<br>
This is a very well-done set. The design is pretty realistic. It has so many features that even if you aren't into City or Space or anything 'real,' you will still have to get this. I expect that once it is discontinued, it will be hundreds on eBay and Amazon. This is something you must get before it leaves stores. Seriously, buy it! This is right now my favorite set, but it will probably drop to second when i get Lego Hogwarts this April for my birthday.</p>
<p><br>
Pros:<br>
-Great Minifigure, minus face. <br>
-Excellent design of shuttle<br>
-Lots of great features<br>
-Must have</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Cons:<br>
-The easily fixable face problem....</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Building Experience - 5 - Not overly challenging but it was definitely fun and pretty good. Not easy, and you get numbered bags which can be helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Parts - 5 - Lego picked the best parts to make this set, including the new cockpit piece and Helmet 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Playability - 5 - I have never been able to really play with a real Lego set, this I can play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Value for Money -&nbsp; - This is hard. The piece count would say it should be about 25 bucks, but in the end it is fairly big at about a foot long and 8 inches wide it is pretty big and you get big pieces. I'm going to give it a 4.5 because this is a hard decision, but I'll give it a five here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20/20 = 5/5!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"TopperTwist","2011-03-31T15:48:10.77Z","Up, Up Here we GO, Where we Stop Nobody Knows! Oh!","<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;For $30 I was pleasantly surprised. This set is large, and playable (grammar check?). I really love this. If you didn't get Shuttle Adventure because it's too pricey, here's your chance. Review in short: Any city, space, or generic Lego fan should get this set. </p>
<h4>Minifigures:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Okay, here's where the set lacks a bit. Only one minifigure. Typically in a $30 Lego City set we'd expect two or three. It shouldn't change now. This set does include one new minfig, though. He has a very common City face with the orange sunglasses, generic white Space Police III helmet (I really hate that mold), and a new double-printed torso. I'm a big fan, now why can't we get two of these guys! The best part about the minifig in this set, however, is the secondary helmet. It's a white version of the Atlantis one with the already-been-used gold large visor. Excellent.</p>
<h4>Accessories:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Only two for this set. A coffee mug and a satelite dish. Just a red mug; nothing new here. The satelite is pretty neat, though. It has transparent extendable flaps with a sleekish-looking base. It also has pegs to attatch to the Canadian Arm. Decent accessories; what you'd expect in this set.</p>
<h4>The Set:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This is a nice sized shuttle. With a POOP cockpit, it makes it very easy for younger builders to put together. As a TFOL looking for a build, I was a bit dissapointed, but again, this is Lego City. The color scheme is great, with only a few NASA stickers. Thumbs up, Lego!</p>
<p>&nbsp;The main play feature of this set is the pull-open back. Inside, you see a generic Canadian Arm, satelite storage, and a helmet storage spot. You can remove the retractable arm, but that's about it. The best part is the swooshability of this set for sure!</p>
<h4>The Good:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;I really like the secondary astronaut helmet, the playability, the design, the size, and how this set feels heavy.</p>
<h4>The Bad:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This set needs to improve on including more minifigs, more accessories, and a&nbsp;few more pecies because the Price-Per-Peice is bad.</p>
<h4>Final Thoughts:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This is a very nice set. I would only reccomend this to AFOLs who like space or city, really any TFOL could find some use for this (like I did), and for sure any little child would love this set! I know a bit younger version of myself would. Go get it! Where are the other Space sets in America though?</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"parchioso","2011-05-16T11:10:40.62Z","A space shuttle for educational purpose","<p>I have been a space fan since I was a kid, but I wasn't able to have many space related toys back then, and among the Lego space sets, Space Shuttle and lunar landing sets have been the most wanted sets I believe, missing the discovery theme back in 2003, having the chance to have a Lego space shuttle definitely is something exciting to talk about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if budget and space allowed, 10213 is a great set to have the Space Shuttle, 3367's shuttle is not proportionally right to make you ""feel"" the Shuttle, the designer could have scale it up just a bit to make it more appealing, but on the other hand, to provide the shuttle for young kid's educational purpose, for budget and storage/display space consideration, it is a good set to fit the need of a particular Lego user base. In fact, I was not the one who built this set, my 5 years old daughter did it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shuttle in 3367 features a hinged arm and a satellite, all can be fit into the compartment, and cockpit cover is a printed part but the pattern is not that space tech looking to me, and the internal deco is also not so good, for example, I am not sure why a cup is there instead of control panel, yes, the space is small inside the cockpit, but it should be enough to accomodate a few more items there to make the cockpit internal more interesting.</p>
<p>[img]http://brickand.me/content/binary/Lego-3367-Space-Shuttle-(7).jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The landing gear cannot be retracted and that is something that can be improved in the design.</p>
<p>[img]http://brickand.me/content/binary/Lego-3367-Space-Shuttle-(2).jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The astronaut is a key component there, I am not very pleased with the minifig head as I think a better and more professional looking guy would be a better fit, but the gold coated helmet for the astronaut to use when working in space is an excellent piece.</p>
<p>[img]http://brickand.me/content/binary/Lego-3367-Space-Shuttle-(8).jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, if you are looking for a serious shuttle model, 3367 may be disappointing, but for a small kid with passion about space, this set is a very good place to start, for which I think is extremely useful in my case. </p>

"legodude357","2011-04-11T21:27:52.713Z","I was so excited yet so dissapointed...","<p>As soon as I saw this set on Brickset, I knew I had to have it! I strolled all around the lego store looking for it. I started on the left side, walking slowly viewing every piece of merchandise. I was thinking of getting something different, when I was getting a bit frustrated by not finding it. I noticed the larger space shuttle, and pondered whether or not to get it, but realized I didn't have enough money. A tad depressed, I stalked out of my favorite store ever, and was struck by a single space shuttle alone by the lego architecture sets. I smiled then skipped to the register.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box portrays the feeling of space O.K. The back has some facts of the model as well as the classic HEY! advertisement. The instructions had an interesting few pages of facts about NASA and space and the shuttle itself. I don't recall any mistakes.<br><h4>Parts</h4><p>I began to be disappointed when I tore open the box and excitedly ripped the bags open, not even bothering to sort the pieces. There were barely any pieces and the majority were specialized pieces. It felt like a lazy quick build at an over-the-top pricepoint. I was dissapointed, but trudged on and finished it.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>One minifigure is included. One of an astronaunt with a face a don't really like, but has two different helments as well as a coffee mug. which would really be useless in space. They should have included a tooth paste tube marked, ""FOOD"". =o)<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was lazy and easy. It felt over-junorized and I was disappointed. Way too easy. Maybe it was because I am an expert builder. IDK. But it was only the start of the let down.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model has a nice deployable satellite, and the sides can open to place it inside. I began to play around with it to find it got boring very quickly with only one astronaut and no other features. The box and above images show a flawless streamlined lego set. In reality the model was placed at an angle so that the hideous-ness of the back thrusters could not be seen. They have a gap between the side of the ship and the cover for the thruster, It looks really bad. If they were going to come up with all these special peices, they could have at least specialized a piece for the back.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All-in-all, I was very excited to get this, but was dissappointed. It was a model that was a good concept, a nice space shuttle at a fair price point, but turned into a disaster. In my advice, I would honestly say to skip this one until it's on clearance or you&nbsp; find one for a good price. I would not recommend this to a friend and suggest you save your hard earned cash for the Shuttle Adventure. At a $99.99 price point, that seems like a much better deal.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,3,1,2,1,2

<p>There is one minifigure included, which is an astronaut. The astronaut has back&nbsp;printing, two different helmets, and a nice looking design. The minifigure head is weird with the sunglasses. Why would an astronaut need sunglasses if he has a visor? It&#39;s a shame there is only one minifigure.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I had fun building this vehicle and it was a good experience. Quite easy to build, but I was thrilled by how much fun it was.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks identical&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;miniature model of a space shuttle I have in my room. I am very impressed with how the model looks.&nbsp;It fits comfortably in my hand when I hold it. There is barely&nbsp;enough room for the minifigure to fit in the bridge of the ship. I would have preffered two seats in the cockpit. The satellite is neat, but breaks easily.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set, but there are a few tiny things that could be improved. The set could be enhanced by another minifigure, more room in the shuttle, and a less breakable satellite dish. I have this set on display rather than playing with it, so I believe there will not be a lot for kids to do if they get there hands on this set.&nbsp;Other than this, the shuttle model is excellent, the minifigure is nice, and it is overall a fun little set that is well worth the price.</p>
