"puddlejumper1","2011-07-14T04:05:43.23Z","Great addition to your police force!","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be reviewing the LEGO City Police Helicopter #3658.I picked this set up when I went to the Lego Store in Natick MA. It was retailed for 34.99 USD. I think that's a resonable amount. When I got home I built this set right away. It was very fun to build and it wasn't that difficult to build either. This set has many rare parts. It is very fun to play with. I'm like how you can take off the roof of the cockpit to fit the pilot inside! This set comes with 4 minifigures. There are 2 police officers, a pilot, and a criminal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Truck: This set comes with a yellow truck&nbsp;for the criminal to escape on. I am glad LEGO included a truck.&nbsp;I like how they included a cab to hold the money. I wish they&nbsp;made a door for the cab so that the money doesn't fly away when the criminal is speedind away from the cops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helicopter: This Police&nbsp;Helicopter is&nbsp;a lot bigger than the 7741 Police Helicopter. I like the cockpit a lot! There&nbsp;are 2&nbsp; rare printed pieces used for the controls and a coffee&nbsp;mug. The roof of the cock pit&nbsp;pops off easily&nbsp;for play inside. There isn't much&nbsp;in the&nbsp;inside part of the area&nbsp;behind the cock pit&nbsp;but there's a lot of detail on the outside of the helicopter. On one side there is a light and on the other side there is a seat for a police officer, another light, and&nbsp;a rope for the police officers to get down if they need too. There are also lights on the bottom of the helicopter along with wheels.</p>
<p>I wish the top of the whole helicopter could come off easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall I would give this set a 5/5. It's not a masterpiece but it is a great set.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"stagus","2011-09-22T04:22:56.983Z","Cool Chopper - Basic Van","<p>Another addition to the police in my lego city.&nbsp; Did I need it need it&nbsp;- probably not but I did want it.&nbsp; Was it worth it - probably.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The main reason to purchase this set is the helicopter.&nbsp; It is excellent with a searchlight and camera as well as a rope to let down one of your police minifigs to catch the criminal.&nbsp; The chopper is very similiar to to the fire one but id the first 'large' police one I have seen.&nbsp; It is numbered 5 to fit in with this years police theme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the downside the criminals truck is very basic.&nbsp; Having recently built the Police Chase set with 2 fab vehicles in it this one just doesn't cut it.</p>
<p>Nice minifigs if nothing unusual....oh and I should mention the box is one of the new slim ones with 'Limited Edition' down one edge.</p>
<p>Great playability for the kids I would say.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cool Helicopter 
<li>Great playability 
<li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Criminal vehicle 
<li>Price - £27 - a bit much 
<li>…</li></ul>
<p>In conclusion a good set....not a great one.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
