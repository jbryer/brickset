"TopperTwist","2010-12-30T20:05:21.027Z","Great Battle Pack","<h4>Opening:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This set is pretty good for only $10 in the US. You get four minifigures and a police dog. With a few accessories.&nbsp; If you want the point of this review: I think this set is worth getting for the police dog and backup money pecies and figures, but not for the accessories.</p>
<h4>Figures:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;I think the remade old police torso with back printing is great to see again. It's also nice getting a black lightsaber hilt and an extra cop. However, all the criminals in Lego City are the same, escaped convicts with red crowbars, facial hair, and a beanie, stealing money. How original. It's good to get some criminals, but I don't like getting the same criminals in prisoner uniforms. BTW the new German Sheopard dog peice is awesome!</p>
<h4>Accessories:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This makes the set cruise downhill. The quad looks like that toy you always wanted but never got when you were 7. The ride-on car. Exactly what the police quad ressembles, but uglier. And the ATM looks unrealistic and strange. But we do get 2 money peices...</p>
<h4>Closing:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This set would be perfect for $7. $10 is kind of pushing it. If they just dropped the price to seven bucks and ditched the quad and ATM, this set would be spectacular. I would reccommend you get one for the figures, crowbar, backpack, and doggy! How ever this set is a lot for a little, it's still sliding past the 'worth it' line. </p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,4
"coldcomfort","2011-01-06T16:39:18.267Z","7279 Police Minifigure Collection - Round out your cops and robbers fun for cheap!","<p>I've seen people here and elsewhere say that they feel this set is a bit overpriced. I must respectfully disagree. Yes, the quad bike is a bit rudimentary but it's a decent looking space filler in the equipment lot behind your police station or at the very least a good little pile of useful bricks, bearings, wheels and tires. Who can't use more of that stuff? At any rate, in my eyes the ATV is a freebie because what this set is really about is the four minifigures.</p>
<p>I've been looking around for some inexpensive minifigures this week because I only have a small handful. What I have found is that you simply can't get a minifigure anywhere that I've seen for less than $2.50 - more when you include shipping. The way I see it four minifigures at a minimum of $2.50 each is the $10 USD price tag of this set. All the other neat little things included with them are just gravy - and good gravy at that!</p>
<p>I really like the shepherd and I think the ATM will look plenty realistic enough outside a convenience store or the like. It's easily on par with the phone booth from the 8402 Sports Car set.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The image is simple. I've seen better presentation.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set has numerous parts that I got it for. First off, there's a crowbar piece-LEGO is really losing some of it's old morality-now they have evil-ish criminals, guns, etc...anywas. We also get a sack that's effective for carrying stolen cash! That's new! Lastly, we have dollar bills and a more intricately printed police dog.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>They're awesome. You get two criminals, both very realistic (although I doubt that real criminals would wear their jail clothes in public) and two police officers with great uniforms. I just wish they still had police on the helmets like they used to.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's simple-but it's a battle pack. The vehicle was nothing new, and neither was the ATM.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Again, there's not much about it. But it looks pretty decent. I think the vehicle could have been done in a better way, but as it stands it's not half bad.<br></p>

"AETerry","2011-01-24T17:53:54.477Z","Police Minifigure Collection","<p>At $9.99, this set is comparable to other Battle Pack collections and the <a title=""View full details of set 8401: City Mini-Figure Collection"" href=""../../detail/?Set=8401-1""><strong><FONT color=#4667a4 size=2>8401</FONT></strong></a>&nbsp;City Minifigure Collection of 2009. Compared to the Star Wars Battle Packs, it is cheaper by about $2 due to lack of Liscense for a name brand&nbsp;and fewer bricks by constract for the minibuilds in the Battle Packs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will say for certain that this Minifigure Collection is by far better then the City Minifigure Collection as there aren't any extra signs to ""pad"" out the set and feel like wasted bricks. That's probably changing my opinion now after over a year and giving better thought to these sets and reviews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 4 minifigures in the pack, 5 when you include the dog you have a good assortment of figures to work with. 2 Policemen, their K-9 unit and 2 Crooks. Already there's lots that can be done with just that. The Cops are decent with sporting a new style for their uniforms while still being able to integrate with older sets/fleets/squads of Police minifigures. The crooks are a bit stereotypical with the stripped shirts and cell room numbers on them. I suppose it's a gimmick or trick that works for younger children in identifiying the bad guys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's plenty of new accessories, many of them are new such as the red crowbar and satchel. The crook's sport beanie caps and the Cops, one of them carries an interesting use for a lightsabre handle as a flashlight and instead of one pair of handcuffs, I've got two so both crooks can be properly apprehended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a small ATV style Police Car that's a fairly standard build making decent use of elements and doesn't try to do anything unsual with the build. It's simple and honest. The other small build is that for the ATM machine complete with cash inside&nbsp;which I enjoy seeing and makes for a wonderful little addition to a City/Town scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The instructions aside from the new standard of giving a listing of what elements are in the set and a Customer Service number should there be any problems, has a fun little comic for children to look at it. There's also a code for unlocking secret content on various LEGO sites/areas related to the City Police theme. As well as an ad for the upcoming Lego City Video game and three pages for the current Lego City themes for 2011 Police, Shuttle and Fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see where a child will have many hours of play with just this for a starter set or adding it to other City themes they may already have. For AFOL's who've been around the block a few times and have seen a large number of police sets over the years, this isn't bad for trying to give a fresh look at the Police theme and one that's pretty much a tried, true and tested standard &amp; must for a City collection.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

<p>There are many good parts in this set. There is the ATM machine, the two money pieces, the red crowbar, the knapsack, the dog and the torch. That is why I bought this set, along with the fact that I needed more policemen and criminals. However, the price to piece rating is pretty high, as I bought it for 15 dollars, so I was a bit hesitant to buy it. Minor Con.</p>

<p>The build is very short,as the ATV and ATM Machine take up almost all of the building. However, it is a impulse set, so all is forgiven.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The ATM looks awesome in a city layout, yet its always on a sort of backwards angle because it won't fit on studs properly. The ATV looks a bit small compaired to other police vehicles and I think it would be better if they raised the price a bit and put in a normal police car. Minor Con.

I'm not a big City fan, but the robbers in this current City line just ooze character. The two included in this set are no exceptions. You've got the cool one--who I figure is the leader--and the crazy one with the gold tooth. I especially like their hats, which are probably also good for dock or waterfront workers. The police are nothing special, but they make good straight-man foils for these robbers. There are some nice accessories too, like handcuffs, a crow-bar, and the dog. </p>

<p>This set is primarily about the minifigures, so the build is nothing special. The ATV is a fun, solid,&nbsp;little vehicle though and the ATM is a nice touch. Plus, one can never have too many money tiles! The fun little comic at the end of the instructions is a nice bonus.</p>

Your philosophical question for today is as follows: did the city hire an army of policemen to combat the crime wave in the city, or are the citizens rebelling against civil society because they are sick of 24/7 surveillance? You and your child will surely spend long hours debating the merits and pitfalls of each side of this dichotomy, and what an educational opportunity it will be to cite various seminal philosophical works in order to justify your varied points of view!</div><div><br></div><div>What’s that? You don’t see this as being a particularly realistic scenario? Well, fine then, guess I’ll just review the set. I had no real intention of ever picking up Police Minifigure Collection; being in the possession of a number of recent police sets already, I figured that I had already had my fill. Then there was a confluence of events: I had a small bit of money left over from an Amazon gift card, and it was being sold at 10% off, so I says to myself, I says, why the heck not.</div><div><br></div><div>I won’t bother insulting your intelligence by telling you what you get in this set since it’s all perfectly clear from the box art. Other than the Minifigs (and the dog), the two primary builds here, if you will, are the strange police ATV and the ATM, the latter of which is easily incorporated onto the “sidewalk” of any of the buildings of City Corner (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7641-1"">7641</a>). It’s a simple and elegant build and I suppose will appeal to folks who have fantasies of lifting an entire ATM away. The ATV, however, leaves a lot to be desired and is frankly pretty ugly, although it may find a home for people who intend to collect the 2012 “forest ranger” sets or who have some other kind of rugged theme going on in their displays. Perhaps it could serve as a proxy “police car”, since Bank &amp; Money Transfer (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3661-1"">3661</a>) and Car Chase (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3648-1"">3648</a>) and both a tad pricey and hard to find.</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, I would not have bought this set had it not been offered at a heavy discount to me, which it was. Unless you truly feel as though your city is lacking in law enforcement personnel, I would recommend giving this set a pass and accumulate policemen through other “proper” sets, if you will. I’m not disappointed, though, because my Gangster (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=8805-1"">8805</a>) is always looking for cannon fodder for his crew.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,2,2,3,3,3

We also have a Youtube account - Mrconnor2000 - Which has lots of Lego Imformation, Reviews and more so please subscribe and rate this review 5/5.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The Box had a great front cover and had 4 alternate images on the back showing playability features. it included one main bag which had a smaller bag inside. There was one instruction manuel which had pictures of other related sets on the back.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Lots of New parts were included in this set. They are - The red crowbar that one of the robbers are holding. that new piece is a great piece for any Lego city Police fan and it can be well used in scenes in your City. Next - another new piece is the Bag piece that a robber has on his back. it can hold Lego as shown but it only has room for as much as two 1x2 tiles.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Minifigures in this set included of two robbers and two policemen. The policeman on the buggy has No new items as usual except his torso has been updated a bit so it has a walkie talkie on it and a shiner badge. the other policeman has a cool but unusual new piece - a white cap. It has no printing and we think its a great edition to the police team. The robber on the Left of the box has nothing new except the crowbar which we've already talked about but the robber on the right has a light grey hat and a new torso which is the normal robber torso with a light grey jacket over the top which is really cool!</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build only took about 10 minutes to make and it was very fun and exciting to build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model was really good and we were happy with our selfs that we bought that set. The completed model has four minifigures, a police buggy and a cash machine. One problem that we had to face though, was the fact there was a sticker! the sticker went on the front of the buggy and said 'Police'. the rest was printed tiles like the cash machine screen. A great little set for anybody and for £8.49 or $9.99, its totally worth it. :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
