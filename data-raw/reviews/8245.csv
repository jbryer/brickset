<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Dog 
<li>Good Value 
<li>Easy Build</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Loose Dog 
<li>Blue/Red Police Light</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set was great for my 4 year old son and&nbsp;I to build together. Wheel wells and Dog are nice touches. The only problem is the Dog rolls around in the back because there is not anything to attach him to. The only other thing is no red light for the police siren. I very much prefer the blue/red light combination over all blue.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"legodude357","2011-01-29T17:16:30.88Z","Decent, but does what it set out to do!","I bought this the other day along with Small Car, which was on-sale at target for $4.50.<br><br>The build was quick, no complicated techniques, and is pretty standard for a Lego&nbsp; car. The dogs cage is removable, so you can use it as a dog house. The opening mechanism for the cage for the dog is just a hinge peice. And the area itself is flat, so the dog rattles around while your playing. But, again, quick, simple and satisfiying build.<br><br>The minifigure is basic police officer, mine had an older body with the badge over one of his pockets. His hat is white, and has a curved brim and can be put on backwards and not hide his face like the older Lego hats. He comes with two handcuffs, which are made of a new rubber material, NOT plastic as the older ones are. He also has a walkie Talkie. Pretty standard for the Police sets.<br><br>The new dog is actually specially designed for this set. If you dont know what I mean, try fitting one of the older dogs into the cage. See? Its too big. This dog is smaller, but has more details, and no its not a sticker. But maybe a leash could have been included for the dog.<br><br>Finished model is nice, sleek, and fits well with any lego city, big or small. Not much to say, but it does look nice. Also there's a new peice at the front. A 1x4 flat peice with a flat area in between two studs. Look at the enlarged image to see what I mean. There stickers, but as I have said before, lets just deal with them.<br><br>Overall<br>The model should have been $7.99, or should have included another figure, or another dog and a leash to justify the price. I reccomend it, but only if you have a lot of money to spend, or you really like it. But it does look cool, I can't stress that enough. If you can, you could buy two, and not put the police stickers and lights on one, so that it could be a civilian vechile! I might try that.. When the price goes down. :)Thanks for reading!<br>",TRUE,3,4,2,5,3
"AETerry","2011-02-02T20:04:03.54Z","Police Dog Unit Review","<p>This is my second of the new 2011 Police sets and I'm left feeling just a little lukewarm after doing the build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a set this size, it's a good price at $9.97, you get a Police man and his K-9 companion. The instructions are easy to follow and it's a quick and easy build. I think what bothers me with this set is that the back of the vehicle that houses the dog is too square, it could have looked more stream-lined instead of boxy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still it's good, it's the first Police Vehicle to come out for K-9 units, extra set of handcuffs to make sure you can apprehend all the baddies. New dog is good. Colorwise... or perhaps design wise it's got a fresh look that I haven't really seen or noticed in a long while with Lego.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

I don't know if any pieces are exclusive or that, but other than that the pieces themselves were kinda boring. The minifig was a nice addition to my other police figs. The dog was cool, I thought. The door in the back falls off a lot, but it was a good idea. I wish it would've come with a crook on a motorcycle or something, too. Other than that, I thought it was a really great little set!

The licence plates are a nice touch and their are other little details like head and tail lights. One slight issue is that the roof is only attached to the wind screen and not to the back of the cab this makes the front of the van a bit wobbly <br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"cityboy518ipswich","2011-02-18T14:31:56.133Z","Such a Neat Little Set!","<p>Okay, so at school I got a £10 amazon voucher, and spent it on this and the police motorcycle (which hasn't arrived yet and I will review it), and I have to say,&nbsp;7285 is a great little set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Price:</h4>
<p>I paid £8.09 for this, which is 90p off the official retail price, a pretty good price I thought. </p>
<h4>The Box:</h4>
<p>Standard City Box, showing city skyline and the sets features.</p>
<h4>The Parts:</h4>
<p>Some nice new parts, which are the new dog, the trans-dark blue 1x4 tile and the 1x4 tile with studs on end. But other than that pretty standard pieces. But the dog cage windows are always good for MOCing.</p>
<h4>The Minifig and Dog:</h4>
<p>The Minifig is a standard police figure, but has the new cap in white. I'm building an army of police figures but I only have 2 robbers lol. But the dog is the clear winner in this set. It has wonderful new prints on it's face and I love it so much, and, It doesen't have to be used as just a police canine. I can give it to my lego families!</p>
<h4>The Truck:</h4>
<p>Nice to add another police vehicle to my collection, you can never have to big of a police force, and it's nicely designed but it didn't look like they bothered with wheel arches&nbsp;for the rear wheels, but oh well.</p>
<h4>Overall:</h4>
<p>A lovely little set for under £10. I highly suggest going out and buying it. I give it a 5/5</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"BrickTVReviews","2011-06-04T23:50:47.97Z","My Last Purchase Before 7938 & 3181","<p>Welcome and today I&nbsp;have set 7285 Police Dog Unit. You all may know it as Police Dog Assignment and when I heard that, I realised that it is a big size, until Lego Wikia said Police Dog Unit. Anyway, onto the review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Choosing A Set</h4>
<p>I was actually buying the X-Large Baseplate [Grey] to improve my animation on YouTube under the username <strong>BrickTVEntertainment</strong> until I remembered that I was here to buy 7285 or 3179 <em>Repair Truck.</em> But I bought this first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box</h4>
<p>The box holds the normal <em>City </em>boxart. Again we see the HEY! [I love it, always!] that has been appearing since 2010 <em>City</em> sets. Like any other<em> </em>LEGO sets we have the thumb tabs to open the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>I have a problem with the instructions. On the part where it tells you to put the blue 1x1 control stick on the final pages it tells you to put it in the 5th stud from front [oooooo]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place here</p>
<p>The box shows it attached to the second stud from front [oooooo]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place Here [According to box]</p>
<p>The booklet is strange and unusual as it doesn't have the sets advertisement. Though it still has the Nielsen ad&nbsp;and the parts inventory list. Other than the 1x1 control stick-stud misshap it is clear to understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Contents</h4>
<p>I don't remember but I think it was 3 or 2, maybe. The biggest polybag has the large parts and the smaller on the smaller bags like ussual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>I love this set because of the parts, great for MOCs. The 1x4 with 2 studs is new to the 2011 <em>Police </em>sets. the 4x4 [maybe] flat with no studs in the middle is new too. A rare part is the policeman's white U.S cap, it has appeared in 2010 but this is the first time in white. Also the 2x4 flat tile with clips along with the 1x2 with handle which make up the opening police dog carriage function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4>
<p>The policeman is nothing new but the dog is the new one previously featured in the 7279 <em>Police Minifigure Collection.</em></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Build</h4>
<p>The build is entertaining. This is a medium sized build for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Model</h4>
<p>The model is good. A midsized van for the police department. The use of 1x2 flat with 1 stud to hold the dog carriage is creative, good job LEGO!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p>I recommend the price to be lowered to the same as the 3178 <em>Seaplane.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Story Corner</h4>
<p>I bought this set to expand my police force, like in the case of 8401 <em>City Minifigure Collection</em></p>
<p>I build this at night in the car. It will be my last set before 3181 <em>Passenger Plane </em>and 7938&nbsp;<em>Passenger Train.</em> Due to the immensive price of both here. This is the last for 2 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Buy this if you want a police dog unit. If to have the one from the old 2008 Police Station this isn't necessary unless you want another one.</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2011-11-04T22:15:43.47Z","Dog days.","<div>Having next to no knowledge of police work other than what I’ve seen in <i>Lethal Weapon</i>, I went to check out Wikipedia (the veritable font of all knowledge, obviously) to see what they have to say on the subject of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog"">police dogs</a>. To summarise, dogs in a police force provide the valuable function of being able to use their keen sense of smell to detect what Homo sapiens cannot, and the things that they are trained to sniff out are rarely pleasant: people trapped in rubble after disasters who may or may not be alive, illegal drugs, explosives, chemical accelerants that may be present in a suspected arson case, cadavers, and so on.</div><div><br></div><div>“Cops and robbers” is one thing, but I’m not sure exactly how one might explain the function of a police dog unit to a six-year-old, because none of the aforementioned topics seem particularly nice things to bring up in front of a child. I suppose I’m all for educating children early in the ways of the world, but, having no children myself not really having the imminent desire to have any, I can’t help but wonder if this question has come up or not in regular conversation amongst parents who did buy this nifty set for their kids.</div><div><br></div><div>But, in deference to actually staying on topic, I’ll leave that question for others to ponder and get to my review. Police Dog Unit is a nice little set, providing another well-designed vehicle to augment the traffic flow in your town or to otherwise beef up law enforcement in your totalitarian LEGO city-state. The vehicle is a little smaller and cheaper than its cousin Prisoner Transport (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7286-1"">7286</a>), but you’ll probably end up getting either both or neither in the end anyway since they do complement each other very well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You get one police Minifig and a couple of accessories for him, which is not atypical for a set of this size, and you also get a pretty cool LEGO dog, which is the same mould, I believe, as the Harry Potter Grim or whatever it’s called but with more detail, making it look much closer to being an actual German Shepard as opposed to just being a solid brown dog-shaped plastic mass. Another great feature that’s not immediately obvious from the promotional image is that the “dog carrier” detaches from the van for easy transportation to whatever horrible disaster site that you have created from the recesses of your twisted mind. The dog has ample space to be housed in this carrier, which is a great player for kids who are hunting down murder victims in narrow back alleyways. As for myself, I’ve combined this with the Airport (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3182-1"">3182</a>) so that the dog has baggage to sniff, just in case some drug lord happens to be passing through (hey, it happens). Oh yeah, and there are stickers, too, but I found that most of them were mercifully easy to apply and did not require an advanced artificial intelligence system in order to get them straight.</div><div><br></div><div>AFOLs looking to add just a little bit more to their town will likely get a lot of joy out of this set, especially if police sets are your thing. If you’re a parent who happens to be buying this for your kid, please tell me right away what you tell your child when he or she asks what exactly the point of a police dog unit is because I would like to know. After all, LEGO is meant to be fun and educational for both children and adults, so we should all try and learn a thing or two whenever we spend our hard-earned cash on construction toys, right?</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li><b>1.</b> I think it blends in with other civilian cars pretty well, and doesn't stand out like some other giant Emergency vehicles Lego has made.</li><li><br></li><li><b>2.</b> There is a nice little German Shepherd dog, which, although small, looks pretty cool in person.</li><li><br></li><li><b>3.</b> Im pretty sure this is just extra parts, but I got 2 handcuffs instead of 1, along with another blue 1x1 round stud that I put on the dog for fun.</li><li><b>4.</b> The assembly is pretty easy, and I think its my small, nimble fingers but im a bit of a perfectionist and it was pretty easy to peel the stickers off to get a second (or sometimes fourth) chance!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li><b>1.</b> I guess this doesn't really count as a con, and I blame it on LEGO's Digital Designer which allows you to make a 1x1 brick look freakin' <b>huge!</b>, but I was surprised at how small it was.</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>All in all, I think this is a really great set that if you can find (and it doesn't seem to be rare according to the 1474 people that have it) you really should get!

This is case where it definitely DOES NOT apply. I see it as the younger police officer cousin of 7942. The door opens and closes, there is little holders for items and contains 2 minfigs. However, this is not a set that should be played with by itself. It can make a great display piece (unlike the current police sets... WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY 2014 POLICE STATION!!) and can make a great addition to bigger sets. Why? Pretty obvious, there is no robber&nbsp;minifigure. That defeats the entire purpose of the police force, to catch the robbers. The rebuildability is great on this one, due to how many classic bricks are present. The minifigs are like any other city set nowadays, but that dog was REVOLUTIONARY! This was the first times any&nbsp;animal had any printing, and was a huge step up from the previous one. The printing didn&#39;t make it look kiddish, unlike what happened to the crocodiles and sharks. The policeman minifg has rather conventional parts at time, but since then that hat mould has been phased out ever so slowly, and the police torso (second best IMO, 2014 one was the best)&nbsp;had its last run with this set.
