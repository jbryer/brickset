"Legobuilderguy","2011-01-19T23:21:26.53Z","Take 'em away Dan-O!","This is a great set.&nbsp; Having the previous version of the Prisoner Transport this one is an improvement in just about every way. <br>&nbsp;The new vehicle is longer for starters so there is a bit more room to it. I do like the addition of the seat for the prisoner this one has included. Makes up for the lack of head room in the transport compartment. Also this one uses the nice storage compartment idea from the fire truck so the doors open wide and tall.&nbsp; The back doors of the vehicle are also taller than in the previous edition so it's easier to put the prisoner in without having to take the roof off the vehicle. So all in all from the nicely sloped windshield, to the larger rear doors, and of course for those out there the driver doors, this is a great vehicle to add to your city collection. This set is just great with the crooks motor cycle, cool new back pack and accessories you can't go wrong with this one!<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Mathtrains","2011-01-20T21:24:00.17Z","Catch the Criminals Well in This Vechicle","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Basic box. My instructions were slightly bent. There are some stickers in this set, but not too many.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some cool new parts like the 1x4 plate with 1 stud at each end for a total of two sets. You will also find the new backpack part.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>One police officer with the basic smiley face from modern times. I get bored of this face quite frequently. The criminal is the LEGO City textbook definition of one. I see that giving us more criminal faces is not on the agenda for LEGO based on some of the police sets.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Not too hard. This is a truck that could be used for many purposes. Ambulance, postal service.. the sky is the limit!<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>A really good prisoner transport vehicle. Everything is complete and modern. More space for criminals is the only thing I would have liked.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Buy this set if you don't have it! I had listed that I wanted the prisoner transporter from before, but not anymore! A new modern vehicle for your city! Is there anything else that you could want in this set! You do need a prison though to be able to take the criminals somewhere.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"legospongepotter","2011-03-13T10:47:49.88Z","A Pretty Decent Set","<p>I got this recently as a gift and built it quickly. Though it is not the best City set, it's pretty good.</p>
<h4>Minifigures:</h4>
<p>Cop: This is your standard cop. He gets a white cap to put on his head and his yellow head the regular charming smile. He has the black uniform with a gold police&nbsp;badge, some buttons on his uniform, and a breast-pocket. Underneath you can see a tie and a blue shirt. He comes with black pants.</p>
<p>Criminal: I prefer him over the cop because this is my first criminal. He has the gray criminal hat that is circular and has a sort of bumpy ridge on the end. One end is lower than the other so &nbsp;you can tell that one side covers the face, one doesn't. His face is pretty cool. he's a got some 5 o'clock shadow and he's grinning, showing all of his teeth, including one gold tooth. There's a small mustache above his moth. His eyes have that happy/evil look.</p>
<p>The criminal is wearing the new backpack that clips on a minifigure's neck. It's open and you can stick money in there. It fits about 200 dollars (2 bills). You get 100 dollars (1 bill) to put in this backpack. The criminal's torso us a&nbsp;button-up shirt with gray-and-white stripes. You can see that he has no shirt under his prison uniform,&nbsp;just&nbsp;seriously hairy chest. The number <b>50380 </b>is printed on his shirt. He comes with dark gray pants.</p>
<h4>Motorcycle:</h4>
<p>he criminal gets to ride around in a motorcycle. It was an easy build, with 8 pieces used to make it. It has a kickstand and on top is a big orange piece where the criminal sits, and on the bottom is a big black piece that has the wheels. It was a nice inclusion.</p>
<h4>Police Gate</h4>
<p>This is a small thing that was added to the set. It's just a fence that is used to block off roads. It has two stickers, one that says 'POLICE,' and one that has yellow and white squares across it. There are two blue lights on top. It was another nice inclusion.</p>
<h4>Prisoner Transport Truck</h4>
<p>Now for the meat of the set. I liked the design of both this truck and the Canine Unit set, and was thinking on getting either one, but i'm glad I got this. I'll start up front. There's a few headlights and a&nbsp;licence&nbsp;plate&nbsp;reading 'JM 7286.' There's a sticker on the front that represents where the front engine goes, I guess. It says 'POLICE' as well. &nbsp;You get a large blue windshield &nbsp;that is 6 x 3. &nbsp;There are two doors on either side, and the roof can be pulled off so you can see the&nbsp;driver's&nbsp;area. There's a yellow chair, a red mug, and a yellow steering wheel. On the outside there are also&nbsp;side-view&nbsp;mirrors, which are just 1x1 slopes. On top of the roof is another stick saying POLICE and a couple of binoculars for some reason.</p>
<p>The second section is a storage area. On either side of the truck there are doors that resemble garage doors. Both can be lifted up and inside you see a yellow crate. You can&nbsp;pull&nbsp;the crate out from either door. When inside, it actually stays in there pretty firm without&nbsp;moving&nbsp;around very much.</p>
<p>The yellow crate has a new design with handles on either side. There are 6 studs inside with a 2x3 design. You can sake out what's inside the crate to get tons of accessories. You get: A walkie talkie, a bullhorn, a pair of handcuffs, a little flashlight, and I don't know what the last thing is. It looks like a ping-pong battle with a transparent blue stud on it. It&nbsp;might&nbsp;be one of those things cops use to measure the speed of cars. Anyways, it's nice that you get all those accessories. You can easily slide the box back in and snap the door shut.</p>
<p>In the back you keep your arrested criminal. There are two windows in the back on either side with bars in them &nbsp;instead of glass. In the very back there are two white doors with stickers on them saying POLICE (I messed up and these stickers a crooked). &nbsp;You can open on the doors wide enough to see that there is a chair inside. You have to put your criminal in there with handcuffs and close the door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The roof of this set (which covers the last two sections of the truck) has a couple of features. In the back is a little yellow light that moves up and down, and in the middle is a rotation light that moves up and down. There's lot of transparent blue pieces to show that the police own the vehicle. That and the four&nbsp;stickers&nbsp;on the truck saying 'POLICE.' the roof can be lifted off easily and you can see the storage and criminal&nbsp;area from&nbsp;the top. you can also see that each section has walls in between them.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>This set is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;a good set. Any City fans will enjoy this. I'm not a City fan, but I like this set. You do get the accessories and the cool new backpack. I think most people will love building this. It's easy and fun.</p>
<p>Building&nbsp;Experience - 5 - It was a fun build. It was definitely not a challenge, but just a set to build, which was enjoyable.</p>
<p>Parts - 5 - I like the use of a lot of pieces, plus the accessories are pretty cool.</p>
<p>Playability - 4 - You might need a police station or your own little City street to have the most fun, but alone I'm sure a kid could have lots of fun imagining with this set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for Money - 5 - It could have been 17 dollars because of the price range. City Camper looked similar and was the same size and that was 17 bucks. However, you get a lot for a small truck and does look like the set would cost twenty bucks.</p>
<p>5 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 19 = 19/20 = 5/5</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"AETerry","2011-02-02T20:17:13.707Z","Prisoner Transport Review","<p>I'm not sure, once I've gotten done putting this set together it doesn't quiet feel it's worth the $19.99 to put out for it. Being the third of my 2011 Police sets, it was a far more satifying experience building it then 7285 Police Dog Unit set. It seemed strange to me to have this be a modular build and having two numbered bags. Stickers, must not forget stickers... they're in here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lego has done other vehicle sets for Police that are Prisoner Transports, but I've missed out on them. So this one made for a good ""catch up"" or ""make up"". The fence that's included in this set feels like it's too much of an add-on or after thought to increase the piece count. And after warming up to the new style of motorcyles, any set that includes them is fun. It allows for something of a police pursuit of the badguy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build is fairly solid, the roof is designed so you can easilly pop it off and get to inside it better. I remember older lego cars where you'd have to shake the vehicle around a bit and hope the minifigure finally fell out. So this makes it easier to get them in and out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do like the side storage areas, the panal doors that open up and the yellow crate of police gear that can be pulled out. Lots of little goodies, police signal, radio, 2 handcuffs, not just one! bullhorn and the new use of lightsabres for flashlights. I was also humored by the small cup inside the driver's side on the dash board. That was cute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some may disagree with me and say that $19.99 is worth the price, others may say it's too much, you'll have to decide. Though this does indeed make a good addition to any police theme and particularly the 2011 series that it's made for. </p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"taffer1979","2011-05-18T00:48:17.283Z","Solid Police set w/extras","<p>I bought this set to get my first crook. It was awesome that it includes a dirt bike.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-03T06:56:56.7Z","LEGO City (Police) - Prisoner Transport Review","This is a great set to have and a good addition to any LEGO city for sure. This set comes with lot's of stuff like a barrier, a motorcycle and a truck. This model is very easy to build and we also get a few stickers which we need to put on. The motorcycle and the truck can be maneuvered very easily as well. The police truck has some cool lighs which sviwel and the doors on the back can be opened if you want to put in the prisoner. The side has some doors which you can open as well. In the inside you'll find a yellow box with some useful accessories. For some reason the police of the LEGO city theme doesn't have any weapons which they can use to capture the criminals. The ceiling of the truck can be opened and the minifigs can fit in the cockpit very nice and easy as well.<br><br>All

"Harmonious_Building","2011-11-04T22:19:06.24Z","Right to remain silent? Forget it!","<div>Ah, the Black Maria, the paddywaggon; call it what you will, but this grim vehicle has been a staple of the story of policing for hundreds of years, and now you and your children, too, can join in this long and illustrious history by having a LEGO police van of your own! Experience the sheer terror of the prospect of a life thrown away as you escort the hapless criminal to the back of the Prisoner Transport, where you can shut the back doors on him - and his life - forever!</div><div><br></div><div>Well okay, that’s probably not what’s running through most people’s heads when they think about picking this set up, but it certainly ran through mine. This set is a newer iteration of 2005’s Prisoner Transport (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7245-1"">7245</a>), but since I do not own that set, I have no basis of comparison and will simply review this set on its own merits, and it really is a great set with a healthy helping of extras and features.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Unsurprisingly, you get two Minifigs here - a copper and a criminal - with the criminal having in his position one of those ludicrous “money bags” that I’m quite convinced do not exist outside of gangster movies or board games celebrating unchecked and immoral capitalism. The police Minifig comes with a literal crate full of accessories, including a walkie-talkie, a loudhailer, a set of handcuffs, and a bizarre light-up baton thing whose purpose is a bit lost on me. There does seem to be a noticeable absence of a handgun, which is probably deliberate, but nothing is stopping you from picking up one of your own and adding it to his arsenal.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Besides the weird police barrier - whose inclusion is almost questionable - you do get a dirtbike for the criminal to get away on <i>Cool Hand Luke</i>-style (or something), which is pretty neat since the motorcycles are fairly uncommon. The main component here is, of course, the police van itself, which is a little larger than the Police Dog Unit vehicle (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7285-1"">7285</a>) but far less intimidating than the Mobile Police Unit (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7288-1"">7288 </a>- you know, the funny thing is that the more I bring up this set and the more that I poke fun at it, the more I feel I should actually buy it. If you see a review of it here in a couple of weeks, you’ll know exactly what happened), and it manages to pack in a fair amount of &nbsp;playability in a relatively small space. Between the driver’s seat and the back of the paddywagon is a compartment for storing the various policing accouterments, and the crate itself fits fine, although things may spill out in transportation. The crook, on the other hand, has a nice little chair all for himself, although you could consider removing it and cramming in several hippie protesters at once when you go to disperse the crowds at Occupy LEGOland (pre-emptive remark: this throwaway comment will appear dated in a few years, I’m sure). &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As always, the value you get out of this set will depend very much upon how much value you place on police sets as a whole. It’ll add to the traffic without overpowering it, and the motorcycle could easily be given to a civilian if you don’t like the idea of criminals escaping from the police. At the very least, you’ll be able to recreate the scenes from <i>The Dark Knight</i>, or any one of the millions of movies involving a prisoner escaping from a prisoner transport, imagine that. And for parents of boys especially, I’m sure a lot of fun will be had playing cops and robbers. Just remember to tell them that if they are ever going to ride in a police transport, it had better be in the front seat or not at all (and no, I do not mean teaching them how to hotwire police vehicles).&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
