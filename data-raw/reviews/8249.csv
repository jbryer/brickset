"sudorum","2010-12-25T17:20:43.23Z","The law of brick and order","	This particular police set goes well paired up with the previous lego police station that was produced. The set has a good supply of unique officers, including a new dog that has its own bone, bowl, and pen. The two convicts are unique, and the crowbars are also quite new. The cells unfortunately do NOT have a back wall, but the doors can slide open by use of a wall panel. The toilets inside of the cells are ingeniously attached to wall panels which swing upwards so that the prisoner may make his escape. Also, the two beds in the cells are hollow to allow the storage of the crowbars. Decal ""drawings"" are attached on the walls to portray the convicts' cherry doodles.<div>&nbsp;The bottom floor of the station has a garage and a viewing screen. The second floor is equipped with an updated mug shot station which was present in an even older police station variety, and a computer on a desk. Finally, the third floor serves as a room for a water jug, a coffee machine, a desk with criminal photographs, and a desk for studying a diamond and a counterfeit bank note.&nbsp;	The roof of the building, strangely enough, has a helicopter pad with no helicopter.&nbsp;</div><div>Another strange sight is the police officer on a bicycle. Not a good chance he'll be catching any criminals on that contraption. On the down side, this lego has a staggering 35 decals. These, too me, are always a pain to apply, and are more of a nuisance than a positive aspect. However, the set is great, and is a very easy build despite the decal horrors. The price is not too inflated, so purchase is highly recommended.&nbsp;</div>",FALSE,4,4,4,3,3
"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-12-27T12:39:01.013Z","Improved from the last police station","This set is to be released in 2011, but I recieved it for Christmas and enjoyed almost every piece of it. It took me about 4 1/2 hours to build, and I was extremely impressed with the final result. In my opinion, the previous police station (7744) is not as good as this one.<br> <br>To begin with, this set includes 4 officers (1 female) and two prisoners. A newly designed dog is also included, and it looks fantastic. Accessories include handcuffs, microphone, walkie-talkie, flashlight, crowbars, bike, jewel, money, and dish/bone for dog are included. There is also a police car and a compact prisoner transport. You have to fold the legs of the prisoner to fit him inside the transport. I find it odd how the prisoner transport has car doors but the cruiser does not.<br><br>The landscape in front of the police station includes flowers, a bush, two police signs, and a street light.<br><br>After you build the vehicles, the prison cells are next. Each cell features a bed, with the crowbars stored in a secret compartment below the bed. There is also a toilet in each cell, which ingeniously swings open to allow for the secret exit of the prisoners. Both cells share a sliding door panel which opens/closes both cell doors at the same time, which I don't agree with as I prefer each cell door to open individually. Both cells are open-back for the purposes of playability. Below the cells are the garages for the vehicles. On the roof of the cells are assorted radars. The prison area can be accessed via the stairs to the extreme left of the station. <br><br>The next build is the police station. When you enter the first floor, there is a desk with a small number pad on it. There is also a large screen TV to track all the crime occuring in the city. There is a large rotating chair with a cup for the police to sit back and relax while he is watching for crime. Lastly, there is a small area where the dog hangs out, including his dish and bone.<br><br>The second floor includes the area for mugshot. There is a camera stand and on the 1x6x5 panel there is a height measurement meter. Lastly, there is a desk area with a computer and cup. The computer has a new design; it is not the Windows interface (the computer is NOT a sticker). <br><br>The third floor includes a large table with stolen goods, such as the jewel and money bill, where they can be recovered. Also, there is a coffee maker and water cooler. Finally, there is a desk with a desk lamp and paperwork. The roof of the police station has antennas and a helicopter pad (You can get the helicopter separately 7741).<br><br>The prison cells and police station are connected with 2x4 grey flat tiles, 2x2 grey plates, and Technic pins. Aesthetically, the police station is very pleasing because the curved windows give the building a more futuristic, interesting look. Another thing I enjoy is the good use of space. There are no large open spaces or transitional areas between the station and prison; they are placed side-by-side touching. Lastly, this police station, compared to the last one, is very roomy. There are tons of opportunities for you to rearrange the furniture and add new stuff in. <br><br>The thing I found very odd was how all the 1x2x5 and 1x2 white bricks had grooves in them. Sure that would be useful for the sliding garage doors, but they are unnecessary anywhere else. <br><br>Overall, this police station has its share of cons but the pros far outweigh those cons. At 783 pieces for $129.99 CAD, this is not as good a deal as the previous police station, which was 953 pieces for $119.99 CAD, but for all the things you get, I guess that is an OK price. I would recommend this police station to any city fan.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Dodge","2011-01-21T12:24:06.987Z","A very unexpected surprise!","<p>This was my first police station set of my building career.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set itself is nice and large and very easy to put together.&nbsp; The instructions were easy to follow and the outcome is very enjoyable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had originally decided to pick up this set for the pieces I could see: </p>
<p>- garage doors</p>
<p>- minifigs</p>
<p>- windows galore!</p>
<p>- curved white bricks (7 of them)</p>
<p>- unique sticker set</p>
<p>- newer pieces: dog, crowbar, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I was pleasantly surprised (hence the title of the review) to&nbsp;find that all of the white 1x2x1 AND 1x2x5 bricks had the slots for a garage door.&nbsp; This was a nice addition by the builders in charge since these pieces are not readily available elseware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also enjoyed this addition as part of the 2011 Police theme, with it's continuity of numbered cars and bandits/theives/prisoner what have you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very nice addition to any City theme enthusiast!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"TopperTwist","2011-02-12T17:46:22.647Z","Amazing Set, Better Than the 2005 Police Station!","<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;I love this set. The price is right, the minifigures are okay, the accessories are great, and the set is HUGE! What more could you ask for? Review in short: Go get this set, it's worth the $100 spent for the size let alone.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The box is big, as expected for a hundred dollar set. No surprises on the front or back, making it just standard for a Lego City&nbsp;big set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;You get four instruction manuals for this set, which is awful. I want Lego to go back to one or two manuals for big sets. It's such a pain to store and deal with 4! Also, my instructions were thrashed! The big one has a whole corner of the entire manual hanging by a little peice of paper! The others were badly folded at obscure angles. Grrrr....</p>
<h4>Minifigures/Accessories:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The minifigures are alright for this set. You get one detective cop, one female cop, one police with the old police hat, and one with the new-style white hat. And then you get one super common criminal, and one with a new face and torso! That criminal is the best minifig in the set!</p>
<p>&nbsp;The accessories in this set are nice. You get handcuffs, walkie-talkies, flashlights, a police dog, a megaphone, and keys! Awesome for a Lego City set!</p>
<h4>Vehicles:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Vehicles in this set are nice. The bike, not intimidating, but good to see in white! The police car has a nice design with storage in the back. The truck could hold a convict or a dog, but either way the stuff in the back of the truck look dead.</p>
<h4>The Set:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This set is HUGE! The garage is self explanitory, but the prison cells are awesome! The doors are pulled through a little rig on the side, and the insides are rigged up. Under the bed is a crowbar, and the toilet flips up so the criminals can escape down the side! Great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;The actual station is perfect. It's a great design, with the angle and all. The interor is good, and three floors are great. I especially like the breakroom water jug... The rest of the interor is just tables, lamps, mug-shot area; standard police stuff.</p>
<h4>The Good/Bad:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The good: Price,&nbsp;vehicles, accessories, building, and prison cells. The bad: most of the minifigures are boring, the police bicycle, and the interior has nothing special. Also, the peice count is pretty bad.</p>
<h4>Final Thoughts:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This is a nice, big set, clearly worth $100. It's the best police station Lego every released, and that on its own sums up this set....Sorry about the long review!</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"av8r1973","2011-01-15T10:21:22.707Z","Best police station yet!","This set and 7744 Police Headquarters were sitting side-by-side at TRU here in Taiwan. &nbsp;This one was about US$6 more than the previous model. &nbsp;Both have two vehicles, but this one has a bicycle rather than a motorcycle (is LEGO going green?) &nbsp;Well, we picked this one up because it looked more ergonomic for playability and the helipad was better designed for the 7741 Police Helicopter.<div><br></div><div>This was really a good build with lots of details inside on every floor and in every section. The main police station is 3 floors high. &nbsp;The first floor has a welcome area where the commander watches the command center screens from his swiveling arm chair and coffee cup. &nbsp;The second floor has a nice mug shot center and desk, while the third floor has a coffee maker and water cooler - nice touch. &nbsp;There is also a nice inspection desk for investigations.</div><div><br></div><div>The police car is just a standard police car. &nbsp;The second car can be either a prisoner transport or a K9 transporter, but not really both. &nbsp;The dog has to go in sideways, and the crook has to lie down. &nbsp;They are necessary with a police station, but nothing special here.</div><div><br></div><div>The prison wing is nice. &nbsp;The two-bay garage is on the ground floor along with a kennel for the nice German Shepherd. &nbsp;The dog even comes with a bowl and bone. &nbsp;Cool. &nbsp;Upstairs are two prison cells with nicely integrated sliding doors. &nbsp;The prisoners can escape using the stashed crowbar to force the wall and toilet out and then slide down the pole.&nbsp;The roof is nicely appointed with spotlights and communications equipment.</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, this is a nice update to the frequently updated police station standard. &nbsp;I don't see myself adding another station, but I do need a place to house the other police units we have. &nbsp;Perhaps a public safety depot in the future? &nbsp;Please, LEGO?</div><div><br></div><div>If you don't have 7744, this is a great one to get. If you do have it, this one probably isn't necessary, unless you need another precinct.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

<p>pros:</p>
<p>good value,new dog,one of the police is kinda like a rookie,alot of light blue glass peices,the new crowbar peice,and the stairs up to the jail cells.</p>
<p>cons:</p>
<p>very few. I wish that there was a bigger van so it can be like another prisoner transport,and the jail cells i wish that cell opened one at a time</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"stagus","2011-04-18T08:53:15.75Z","Excellent set with huge playability","<p>This is an excellent set.&nbsp; Good build, good looks, good pieces but where I think this will really hit the spot is the playability.&nbsp; There are two vehicles - police car and van.&nbsp; The van has class sides so don't leave the dog in there when it's sunny!&nbsp; There is also the helipad if you have the police chopper.&nbsp; Fits nicely, I checked.&nbsp; You have two criminals, 4 police figs and the dog (complete with bowl and bone).&nbsp; Within the set there is are the two cells, big screen to watch the activities, somewhere to take the mugshots and even a bit for Lego CSI!&nbsp; The criminals can keep their crowbars secretly hidden under their beds before breaking out through the wall in the cell, climbing down the pipe and disappearing on the police bicycle!!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the previous station and this is a step up in my opinion.&nbsp; It looks great in my city and provides loads for younger ones to play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoyable build 
<li>HUGE playability 
<li>Good minifigs 
<li>Nice touch having the helipad</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quite pricey (£72 retail UK) 
<li></li></ul>
<p>I think this is a brilliant set for all.&nbsp; As I've said looks good in a city for any AFOL's but would also be a great set for the younger generation who are getting into Lego.&nbsp; Hope this review is helpful.&nbsp; Happy building!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There is so many good parts in this great set. There is 6 minifigures and the dog. The food bowl and bowl and bone are awesome. The big TV and revolving chair are good too.</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2012-07-27T22:13:42.493Z","Stop right there, criminal scum.","So this set had been on sale on Amazon.com for the longest time, and I refrained from getting it for quite a while since I figured that not only did my town NOT need any more law enforcement officials encroaching into the lives of its citizens, but I also got hung up on collection <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Lord%20of%20the%20Rings"">Lord of the Rings</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Super%20Heroes&amp;subtheme=Marvel%20Universe"">Marvel</a> LEGO, which chewed through quite a bit of my disposable income and put this set further and further on the back burner.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Yet the discount remained, and so I finally caved and got this set for US$75, which is about a 25% discount on the suggested retail price of US$100 - a hefty discount indeed, and one that ultimately proved to be too hard to pass up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is the first police station that I have ever owned, so I will not be making any comparisons to the laundry list of police stations that have been released in years gone by. Instead, I will focus on commenting on this set as it stands. Is 2011's Police Station worth getting? Will your LEGO city feel any safer for having it? Let's take a look.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I will jump the gun a little and give my overall impressions of the set as a whole, and the first thing that should be said is that this set is enormous, and you will not feel jilted even if you pick it up at regular retail price. The baseplates, glass panels, and large white walls give this set an impressive sense of magnitude, making it feel as large as other sets in the comparable price range, if not larger. It's certainly a lot larger than any other City set that I own, dwarfing the airport terminal in <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3182-1"">3182</a> by a huge margin. Aesthetically speaking, this means that this set is sure to dominate your city landscape, unless you happen to have a full complement of <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Large%20Models&amp;subtheme=Modular%20Buildings"">modular builds</a>, which I have yet to look into. Therefore, be warned: you will be introducing a true police state in your town should you pick this up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The six Minifigs that you pick up with this set are nothing unusual. You get two ""bad guys"", a couple of police grunts, and an angry-looking chief to run the administrative and operations side of things. Six Minifigs may seem a little mean for a set of this size, but I guess the understanding is that police sets (and therefore Minifigs) are so easy to come by that I can't imagine this possibly being a problem. It took mere moments for me to forget which Minifigs came with this set and which ones hailed from elsewhere. Of course, if you're left wanting of law-enforcement Minifigs, then the Police Minifigure Collection (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7279-1"">7279</a>) has your name written on it; for what it's worth, I happen to have a review on that, too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>No large City set is complete without a couple of vehicles, and the Police Station provides a pair of them for your pleasure. The police vehicles included here are significantly different from the ones included in Bank and Money Transfer (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3661-1"">3661</a>) and Police Chase (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3648-1"">3648</a>) respectively, so there's no need to worry about repetition. Both vehicles here are well-designed, as always, and I particularly like the police dog transport, which I actually think is superior to Police Dog Unit (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7285-1"">7285</a>), which is kind of large and a bit unwieldy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The construction of the police station itself is divided into two parts, and the amount of building involved is satisfying substantial and enjoyable. The suggested first part is the garage and jail cells built above them, and there's a couple of surprisingly cool details. The police dog actually gets his own little pen, which I was not expecting, and the jail cells feature a neat little sliding mechanism that allows the jail doors to be opened and closed all at once (which is, of course, irrelevant when considering that they are exposed from the back). A number of little details increase the playability for those with youngsters at hand: for example, the prisoners' beds can open up to reveal hidden crowbars, and the toilet bowl sits on a hinged panel that can be swung up to aid the prisoners' escape. These are thoughtful&nbsp;intricacies&nbsp;that are sure to please a child with an active imagination, but aren't likely to be much of a big seller to doddering AFOLs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second component to the police station is the MASSIVE administrative building, which has so many functions that it ends up looking severely understaffed if one is limited to just the Minifigs included with the set. The three-storied building is attached via Technic pins - helpful if shelf space is at a premium - and consists of a lobby where Big Brother monitors thoughtcrime of every sort, a floor for photographic criminal elements of LEGO society, and a top floor that houses a CSI-type lab replete with cute furniture and accessories. You'll need to have some additional Minifigs to keep the operation running, though.</div><div><br></div><div>So is this worth getting? I suppose that the crowning glory of any LEGO town ends up being the Police Station, and if you are a slave to tradition in this regard, you are unlikely to be disappointed. For folks who actually play with their LEGO or have wards who do, I can see this set being a lot of fun, because it's really busy and has a ton of things to do, unlike the more AFOL-oriented Lord of the Rings sets, which simply look awesome. More conscious parents might be happy to know that not a single gun is included in this set, which is surely a conscious decision.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, if you're interested in some of the thought that's gone behind the design of this set, check out the National Geographic's Megafactories episode on LEGO (which you may or may not be able to find on YouTube) - one thing that blew my mind is that the little crowbars can actually be used to pry LEGO bricks apart. Talk about form and function. &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,3,5,5,4

thieves to which they are accessed by a ladder placed on the left side 
of the structure of the garages. </font><font>The cells are from the 
same accoumate structure built in mirror image, there is a common 
mechanism that allows the OPENING of the sliding doors, also within each
 of them is the bed with the secret hideout of the ""crowbar"" to escape, 
and a bathroom / toilet that hides the secret exit to allow the escape for the robber.<br></font></font><font><font class="""">I find these cells very well made ??and cured, and I
 struggle to find defects, than to share the mechanism for opening 
doors, but it seems to be a design decision to recall the old-fashioned 
prison cells imprisonment. </font><font class="""">For what concerns the 
assembly of this part, I do not think that there are particular 
difficulties, and I think should be reported only the widespread use of 
vertical plate to make the outer walls, thus obtaining two advantages for
 </font></font><b><font><font class="""">LEGO</font></font></b><font><font class="""">
 : the first is greater simplicity assembly, and the second, less use of
 brick, in particular, I believe that this choice do not like to
 many </font></font><b><font><font class="""">AFOL</font></font></b><font><font class=""""> , but we know that these sets still represent a compromise between price and range of users is not too high. </font></font><br><font><font class="""">
As far regarding the minifig, the two robber are really nice to see 
(even if more should be differentiated from each other) and only leave 
to the imagination than a thousand locations on the classic </font></font><i><font><font class="""">Cops and Robbers</font></font></i><font><font class="""">
 , marrying perfectly the atmosphere of the prison at hard labor; 
Moreover, it is also very interesting minifigs of cop that represents a 
note of color in a world that usually </font></font><b><font><font class="""">LEGO</font></font></b><font><font class=""""> had reserved for male characters.</font></font><br><font><font>Completed cells and garages, we proceed to the construction of 
offices spread over three floors that are flat on the 16x32 baseplate, 
in this case </font></font><i><font><font>the ground floor</font></font></i><font><font>
 is the entrance to the room the dog cop, complete with bowl and bone, 
and the office the operations center where there is a wide-screen to 
control all cameras with a swivel chair to watch the whole thing.</font></font><br><font><font class="""">On the </font></font><i><font><font class="""">first floor</font></font></i><font><font class=""""> is the office place for photos with lots of signs still camera and flash, and a very compact computer station, the </font></font><i><font><font class="""">second floor</font></font></i><font><font class="""">
 there is a coffee machine with a bottle of water nearby, both very well
 made ??and a desk topped with a diamond and notes (to mimic a possible 
seizure of thieves), and finally on the roof of the offices is installed
 a helipad, simple and successful.<br></font></font><font><font class="""">Even the structure of the offices, it should be 
noted the extensive use of vertical plate to make the outer walls, in 
addition, after completing the assembly of the structure, from an 
overall view of the apparent lack of a staircase connecting the several 
floors of offices (especially, the second floor and roof are isolated), 
ladders, which instead have been provided for cells that are located 
above the garages. </font></font><br><font><font class="""">
Completed the police offices, it must be united to all the garages / cells 
using pins technic is to be mounted in brick tecnic specifically placed
 on the sides of the two structures, in addition, the compactness of the
 structure is also guaranteed by the flat tile 4x2 and tile 2x2 gray that combine the two baseplates.</font></font><br><font><font class="""">Complete the set a white bicycle (which for a long time did not appear in this color in any LEGO set</font></font><font><font class="""">) a bush, two signs </font></font><b><font><font class="""">POLICE</font></font></b><font><font class=""""> and a light pole resting on the whole baseplate. </font><font class="""">
<br>At the end of the assembly I believe that could be considered:<br><br></font><b><font class="""">PRO</font></b></font><br>

"BuildTheBrick","2018-04-27T15:53:01.64Z","Great set, almost awesome","<p>This is a fair set. It includes two crooks, four officers, and one dog. In an old LEGO layout,&nbsp;I didn&#39;t use the escape feature of the &quot;Swinging Toilets&quot; very much. Being that it was on the same street that I had blocked off because I put a superhero base there. And did not feel like just making a structure. I didn&#39;t use it much either, now it is near Assembly Square in my layout (Review soon!) and it is hardly noticed&nbsp;because the other side of town has a big construction zone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But on the topic of the set, I think it is a good deal for&nbsp;playability including the toilets and&nbsp;the garage doors. I had lots of fun with the dog bay. However, I would much prefer that when LEGO goes for the open back style that they attempt to have walls that swing down to remove the numbers of &quot;Eyesore angles&quot; that a set has. Using this set as an example I figure this could in a redo be ok for the jail but a bit problematic for the office.</p>

<p><strong>All in all</strong>&nbsp;a good set, but all the playability features seem to thick, not like it is a bad thing for kids, but I think that LEGO should go for satisfaction on all levels.</p>
