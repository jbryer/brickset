 was out to buy myself some new tracks for my ever expanding railway, 
but instead of finding the well loved straight and curve track pack, I 
find this new pack. Upon closer inspection of the box, I wasnt too 
disappointed, as it looked to be a cheaper way to obtain a few flexi 
tracks without having to buy a huge pile of them. But that was before I 
realised they had stopped selling the original straight and curve pack.<br>WHY?</span><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">First
 off, I would much rather have 8 curves than 4 track pieces worth of 
flexi track. Flexi is useful sometimes, but no-one wants mountains of 
it. It looks ugly as anything when used in large amounts in conjunction 
with normal track, and now in order to get more straights you have to 
buy tons of flexi track. And now the pack is more expensive? and you get
 less? What?</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">But---
 before I go on to criticise any longer, I'd still like to thank the 
lego designers or employees who at least care about the ""trains"" 
department. Thanks for trying to do something anyway.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">Anyway
 lego, the thing is, there are a lot of afols into the trains, and we 
would like a tad more variety. Please? How about re-introducing the 
parrallel crossover? Or the cross-track? Why don't you just sell the 
tracks individually like the 9v system did? 16 straights in one box, 16 
curves in another box, and 48 pieces of flexi in another box? Or at 
least sell this new pack in conjunction with the old straight and curve 
mixed pack?</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">The
 problem here is that basic track (straights), of which many are needed,
 are being sold COMBINED with more specialised tracks (flexi). Flexi is 
useful sometimes, but in comparison we need more basic track, and every 
time we buy this expansion pack, we pay more, get less, and wind up with
 more flexi track than we need! (Also note that to buy more curves we 
now have no other option besides buying switches for a measly 4 curves, 
or purchasing a whole new train set...)</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">SO-
 overall this pack isn't terribly bad, but the fact that lego stopped 
selling the crucial straight and curve pack is. Lego could fix the 
problem buy continuing to sell this in conjunction with the straight and
 curve expansion, or even go better by selling each type of track 
individually, and introducing some new track pieces like crossovers or 
cross tracks.<br>Thanks in advance, lego.</span></div>",TRUE,2,2,1,1,1

<p>Straight and Flexes, it's bad. I mean straight acts as, straights of course! And flexes acts, curves and STRAIGHTS! I mean you can make straights with straights, curves with curves, curves with flexes and straights with FLEXES. So you can make double the straights with this set. I mean the flex tracks are for curves right but it can make straights. LEGO, you can do better than this.</p>

Train Station (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7937-1"">7937</a>) comes with four straight tracks, and if you intend to have a decent-looking railroad setup, buying this excellent set is more or less an inevitability.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Level Crossing (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7936-1"">7936</a>) also comes with four straight tracks, and while not as essential to a train display as Train Station, it is fairly useful for adding a nice bit of realism to your growing railroad town.</div><div><br></div><div>3. Yes, they are hideous, but the inherent “bendiness” of the flexible tracks can be rectified by using a couple of long pieces as bracers to prevent them from curving. A bunch of little flexible tracks make for an ugly substitute for a single straight one, but their ugliness is much more ignorable if they are spread out over a set of proper straight tracks.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It’s true that you can’t go wrong with having more pieces of track lying around, but ask yourself if dropping $20 for this is worth it. Personally, I am slightly annoyed with myself for not realising sooner that Level Crossing existed as an option for picking up more straight tracks, and I would never wish this misfortune repeated on anyone else. Of course, if you are fortunate (unfortunate?) enough to have a great deal of space for your train(s) to run, then perhaps this, too, will end up being an inevitability for you. Either way, we all know perfectly well that LEGO has stolen money from us yet again, and we all must be masochists for continuing on with this hobby.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,1,4,1,3,1
"mineroller","2011-11-28T06:47:56.32Z","Flex Tracks are ugly.... ","<br>As a train fan in general, I believe that train tracks do make up at least 25% or more of experience with any kinds of train fan works - be it models, Lego, diecasts, various gauges, etc. Trains are trains because they run on tracks.. otherwise they would be called buses... <br><br>In that sense, Flexible tracks really destroy quite a bit of ambiance of train building experience with Lego.<br>Small quantities of flextracks can be very useful in connecting that two section with just enough offset to not fit together. Otherwise, they turn Lego train tracks into something like Thomas wooden tracks or Duplo, for little kids. It really destroys the look and feel of track layouts in any angle you look at. <br><br>I mean, i know people who collects the old 9V tracks purely because it has metal rails that really adds realism to the track sets. I even have seen someone who paints the current RC tracks with silver enamel to make that feel.<br><br>I know that most people buy this just to get the straight tracks; same for me. I just needed some straight tracks and i won't be opening any of the flextracks for a long time.<br>",TRUE,2,4,1,2,2
"Dude45","2016-12-04T19:15:03.21Z","Good straight tracks, but flexitracks are not very useful","<p>If you have invested in LEGO trains, you certainly need lots of tracks. And it is of course essential to have many straight track pieces. Then you will want to buy many instances of this set.</p>

<p>7499 contains 8 very nice straight track pieces and 16 small flexible track pieces that can be used to create irregular curves. The studs on the pieces make it easy to incorporate them in a City layout and add crossings, signals and more. The dark gray color is a good choice.</p>

<p>A flexitrack piece or two are sometimes great for connecting two track sections which are not perfectly aligned, but unfortunately they&#39;re not useful in these&nbsp;quantities.</p>

<p>While you can use flexitracks to emulate straight pieces, many flexitrack pieces in succession are no good:</p>

<ul>
	<li>They are noisy when trains travel over them</li>
	<li>They make trains more prone to derailment</li>
	<li>They slow trains down and degrade batteries due to increased friction</li>
</ul>

<p>Like everybody else reviewing this product, I am not happy that you cannot purchase straight tracks without being forced to buy tons of unnecessary pieces you already own too many of. Hence the rating is quite poor.</p>

"ZG_Brickfilms","2016-05-26T21:20:44.19Z","Not even a circle","<p>This set includes eight straight track pieces and 16 of the flexible track pieces. As a person who has had a lot of train products from both LEGO and other companies, I expect a loop of track with any set of this type.&nbsp;We don&#39;t get that here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, the flex track is good. It can take some interesting shapes and trains don&#39;t often jump off of it. However, it is very wide turns. When I bought this to have some for my Harry Potter layout, I wanted a loop to ride my hogwarts express on. This doesn&#39;t do it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I feel&nbsp;this is a set for hard core train collectors. The track is good, but I really disliked that you can&#39;t make a full loop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>NOTE: if you are buying only one of these as your only track, it isn&#39;t able to connect in any type of loop.&nbsp;</p>
