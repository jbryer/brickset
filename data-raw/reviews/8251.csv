The sets are far to simple as just minifigures.</div><div>- From an investment standpoint, buying this one right when it comes out will be great for resale. However, as people are catching on to it's popularity, waiting until months after will NOT be a good investment.</div><div>- The great thing is that if you're building a town, these figures will be an amazing addition to your collection. Once again, however, there is a disadvantage. Because of the randomized packages, you may get minifigures for time periods not included in your collection can be frustrating.</div><div><br></div><div>NOTE:</div><div>People have investigated the code, and they can be decoded.</div><div>Also note that the minifigures are distributed exactly equal for each box of 60.

However, if you want certain items, buy off eBay or BL at a higher price and get the exact one you want. This probably isn't the best ""present"", but as most people are saying, it will make a great stocking stuffer.</div>",TRUE,4,5,1,3,5
"ToughTom","2010-12-01T16:24:52.497Z","Few amazing standouts, over all just good.","Theres a few in this set that I like a lot, mostly the Gorilla, baseball player, archer, and fisherman. The mummy worked out pretty good too due to the fact that I really like the Pharoh Quest sets. The only thing I really dislike about these I guess is compaired to the last set is the lack of extras. Everyone came with so many extra pieces and it was awesome. For example the karate master came with two gold trophies but the sumo only has the one. ",FALSE,4,4,2,5,3
"Doctor_Leg_O_Brick","2011-03-19T14:29:17.133Z","A lot better than I thought...","<p>On the&nbsp;eve of Series four, I thought&nbsp;I might as well review Series Three as I did wth Series Two. As pictures came ""into the wild"" just before&nbsp;I reviewed Series Two&nbsp;I said that this series was far from as good as Series Two. My mind has changed about them, as seeing them in real life was better than one had hoped. Yes, Series Two is better, but&nbsp;I think that Series One was not as good as the later Series Three. Anyway, on to the review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fisherman</p>
<p>One of the figures that I think is underated. The fishing rod&nbsp;I understand is hard to put together, but in fact is quite easy. You put the string piece with the stud on the end of the rod facing upwards on the stick,&nbsp;then put the string on to&nbsp;the&nbsp;clip at the top of the rod. To make it look better you can put the fish on. A new torso and head&nbsp;print, a new colour of fish (sand green), a new colour of nit cap (or wooly hat) and a new beard piece make this figure a winner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pilot</p>
<p>This figure can go in a number of themes like City, Adventures or&nbsp;Historical. Not many new parts but still a good figure. New parts here are the head and torso printing and&nbsp;a new colour of backpack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tribal Chief</p>
<p>Great figure to build a tribe with a few doubles of this guy and the Series One Tribal Hunter. All parts on this figure are new or recoloured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samurai Warrior</p>
<p>Wow! Alot better than other Samurai's from the Ninja theme some years ago. He has printing under the armor for anyone who&nbsp;wants to know. New parts for this great figure are&nbsp;FART&nbsp;(Features A&nbsp;Red Torso) in dark red with printing&nbsp;and new head&nbsp;printing, the armor is not new because its the&nbsp;same as the older Samurai's from 1999. Also a great figure to go with Series One's Ninja or the new Kimono Girl in Series Four.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snowboarder</p>
<p>Good figure with a new snowboard&nbsp;as well as the&nbsp;new face/legs/torso printing. The visor is of the&nbsp;new Star Wars Snowtrooper rebels, and the helmet is just a pink helmet. This figure is great to go with Series Five's male Snowboarder and Series Two's Skier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Space Villian</p>
<p>As I said&nbsp;most of the detail of this figure in the other review of him or it,&nbsp;I will&nbsp;keep it short as you proberly will like it that way. I can only begin to describe how much&nbsp;I like this figure, and how much detail went into him. He features a Blacktron Two logo on his chin, as well as heep of wiring on his chest. All the parts are new or recoloured in this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sumo Wrestler</p>
<p>Great figure but could do with a big belly mold in my opinion. He comes with a bronze statue, the same one as Series Two's Karate Master and the Soccer (Football in my country) Player from Series Four.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mummy</p>
<p>Funny that The&nbsp;Mummy comes out just as a theme comes out about them. I think this figure is great as ""army building"" gos, once you have some Pharaoh's Quest sets. He has front, back, arm, leg front, head,&nbsp;leg&nbsp;right side&nbsp;and leg left side printing. He has this ""Green"" skin that looks like hes been locked in a box for a few 1000&nbsp;years and is not happy about it. He also comes with a&nbsp;dark red Scorpion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Elf</p>
<p>If I had to some this guy up in one word, AMAZING! New legs, new torso, new bow, new hair, new legs, new head, new shelid, kind of new cape.... Also, did anyone see that&nbsp;I nearly used the same Mini review of the Spartan without realising??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tennis Player</p>
<p>One of the sports that in my country is very popular as Baseball is in the US. For this figure you need a double if&nbsp;your&nbsp;not displaying it because who is she going to play? The hair on this figure is the same as&nbsp;the Nurse from Series&nbsp;One&nbsp;but in a different colour. The racket is also new.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Race Car Driver </p>
<p>The Race Car Driver is like the Fisherman, underated. OK, I know he does not have machine guns or a sword or ""pointy ears"" but he is still a great figure. He has his own litle name on his belt that reads ""N.Grooves"", so I called him Nick Grooves. He FART (Features&nbsp;A Red Torso)&nbsp;with printing as his helmet is. He comes with a blond Mutt hair piece for when has not got his helmet on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gorilla Suit Guy</p>
<p>Attack of the...Mad man with a Banana?? Yes, his profile on lego.com&nbsp;states he is a man as a Gorilla which is backed up by his back printing, a zip up his back! I love this detail on him as well as his head which has beads of sweat pouring from his head! He also comes with a Banana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Alien</p>
<p>The Aliens are have landed! Doh! I'm three months early... This figure is great allthough his gun is recoloured, as is his head. He has a flight&nbsp;suit that looks great and is screaming ""Take me to your Alien Conquest collection please""...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hula Dancer</p>
<p>Good figure, perfect for a beach party! One of the most common figures in each box as proved by me getting three of them. On problem though so don't mark my review unhelpful for this as&nbsp;I don't know wether its surposed to be like this, but there is gap in skirt when put on the minifigure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rapper</p>
<p>Great for a city collection&nbsp;as the music industry seems to be growing. The boombox is one piece for FOL's (Fans Of Lego) knowledge. The cap is not the old one, nor the new but a brand new mold with a minifigures head on. He comes with the Series Two Pop Star microphone recloured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Baceball Player</p>
<p>The last one&nbsp;I needed again is number sixteen, the Baceball Player, is a great one to buy in multiples. I will, and have, seen MOCs (My Own Creations) done by fans using at least one part of this figure. The Baseball bat, like in real life, is a great weapon for gangsters or any figure for that matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think&nbsp;I enjoyed that review allthough it took me from 9.00AM to 18.15PM GBT. I hope you enjoyed my review, </p>

"spykid27","2011-04-28T06:17:04.05Z","Good parts for a set!","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As usual, minifigures is very popular with some people. But have you ever opened a packet just to find that the minifig is not the one you wanted? or even worse, the one that you did not want? In this review, I have included some tips to prevent these scenarios&nbsp; from happening:</p>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By feeling</h4>
<p>fisherman: Feel for the fish or the rope to the fishing pole.</p>
<p>pilot:Feel for the parachute and goggles. The goggles will have an indented&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;side,unlike the banana.</p>
<p>red indian chief: The headdress is very large and easy to feel</p>
<p>samurai:Feel for the sword or armor, which can be squished slightly by squeezing</p>
<p>snowboarder:The snowboard is easy to feel with both ends curving upward.</p>
<p>space villian:The only unique part to feel for is his robot hand.</p>
<p>sumo:The trophy is small and a little difficult to feel, but you can also try for the knob on his hairpiece.</p>
<p>mummy:Feel for the scorpion.</p>
<p>elf: Feel for the longbow’s unique shape.</p>
<p>tennis player:Feel for the racket</p>
<p>racecar driver:He’s the only figure with a helmet and hair, so feel for both.</p>
<p>gorrila suit guy:Feel for the banana, but be careful not to confuse it with the Pilot’s goggles.</p>
<p>alien:Feel for its head.</p>
<p>hula dancer:Feel for the two maracas, but don’t confuse them with the Rapper’s mic.</p>
<p>rapper:Feel for the mic, but don’t confuse him with the Hula Girl who has two maracas</p>
<p>baseball player:Feel for the bat.</p>
<h4>By the official decoding method:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=decode modo=""false"">Even</a> though the barcodes have been removed from the packages, there are still ways to root out what’s inside. On at the bottom on the back of each package is a series of slightly raised dots. Each figure has its own unique set of dots. They can be difficult to see, but we have compiled a new cheat sheet to point you in the right direction. This, in combination with the decoding tips I gave for feeling the bags should help you find, or at least narrow down your search for the figures you are looking for.[img]http://http://www.itsalltrue.net/reviews/advimages/2010/lego/minifigschecklist3.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;try these methods out if you want to, but they may spoil your surprise. happy guessing and feeling!!</p>
