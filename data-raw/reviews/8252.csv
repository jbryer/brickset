I think this is the best series yet. By the way, these don't come with spare pieces like Series 2 did. Another thing is that after they've been at the store for a while, and people buy them, there tends to be a lot of Ice Skaters, Lawn Gnomes, and Soccer Players for some reason. In general, Series 4 is really awesome.",FALSE,5,5,1,4,1
