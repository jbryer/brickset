"Ernst","2012-01-31T18:08:37.84Z","Mini Digger, Tow Truck, 4x4 Buggy, small cars but great set.","<p>Overall 5 bricks: another ""great"" small Creator set with 3 lovely vehicles and some nice parts. Like most small Creator sets sold in the plastic box in which you can save it when you parted it. Sold for a price everyone can afford, so a big 5 bricks again. I start to like these smal&nbsp;Creator sets more and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building&nbsp;4 bricks: Building is not too difficult but still asks some attention because of all the small parts, probably the reason why LEGO starts with an age of 6 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First the Small Digger, you start with the front part which you connect to the very goodlooking rear part. You connect them with a small hook which when finished allows the digger to turn, very stable thanks to the supportplates. You end with building a very good looking shovel. Result looks and works great! 
<li>
<li>Second the small Tow Truck, also looks nice because thanks to the mudguard and I like the 2 exhaustpipes on the sides. The towing device looks great too. 
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third the 4x4 Buggy: my personal favorite of the 3 vehicles. Simply because how it looks and how the parts are used, the 2 robotarms on the sides, the yellow searchlights and the red tail-lights and the black slopes on the hood make it look great!</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks: I already mentioned several parts in this set like the mudguard and&nbsp;the robotarms. Also very good parts are the black&nbsp;slopes with slots, the big wheels, the yellow plates with holes, the plates with doorrails and so on. Very good !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playabilty 5 bricks: 3 great cars that are all three great to built and play with, 5 BIG BRICKS here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks: all the great fun I mentioned before, the great parts, plastic box&nbsp;and all this for the small amount of no more than €4,99 is a great deal.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"glaubercavassani","2012-06-13T14:16:38.273Z","Em mini escala, um formidável set de cores contrastantes","<p>O que mais chama a atenção deste pequeno mas formidável set é pelo fato de suas cores constrastantes e pela pela representação com a escala proposta. Sem dúvida, é sempre um dos prediletos de quem o adquire. Sua montagem é divertida e a conclusão, surpreendedora.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Peter81","2012-05-26T10:10:46.097Z","Perfect","I bought it because i like the construction theme very much (technic). And for display to will show how big his huge brothers of technic are (8265, 8259). From a distance this cute and tiny wheel loader looks like a real one. Perfectly scaled with only 55 pieces. 5 minutes to build, years to display.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
