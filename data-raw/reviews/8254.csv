"Jamboon","2011-02-23T14:31:05.517Z","Very nice little plane","<p>This Creator mini vehicule gives you the usual three sets of instructions for three interesting models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plane is a great&nbsp;design with interesting detail and much larger than the pictures makes you think it's going to be. The wing span of this thing is really surprising which gives it the most important aspect of all, swooshability. The remaining two models are much closer in size to the other mini vehicules. The speedboat is very nice but the ultralight is much more forgettable. Nothing really striking about the design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the builds are very complicated but should be fun for anybody. You get a&nbsp;nice collection of useful little parts but nothing that rare or that you won't get from similar models. The one uncommon aspect you do get is the colour orange (so stock up for your Halloween MOCs :). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, a very worthy little set. Buy it and swoosh it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5

"Lego_Guru","2011-09-11T19:33:47.347Z","Pocket Plane","<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>The reason I purchased this set was because it looked appealing for its tiny size. I was especially drawn to the colors: white and orange with a touch of black, grays, and chrome. The set includes instructions for three separate builds: a dual propeller plane, a pusher plane, and a speed boat. It comes packaged in a&nbsp;silver and blue canister that can be stacked on top of others of its type.</p>
<h4>Vehicles:</h4>
<p>Model 1:&nbsp;a duel propeller plane with exposed engines,&nbsp;headlights, and a large canopy. This model is very sturdy and good for play.</p>
<p>Model 2: a pusher plane with a lack of detail aside from the navigation lights and engine grills, although for a model this size, I can't complain. Unfortunately the rear&nbsp;wing section&nbsp;snaps off after a fall.</p>
<p>Model 3: a speed boat with a large engine and running lights. This model is very sturdy but has no moving parts.</p>
<h4>Functions:</h4>
<p>With a model this size there isn""t much functionality other than the spinning propellers.</p>
<h4>Summary: </h4>
<p>I&nbsp;think that this is&nbsp;an awesome set&nbsp;for its size and it was well worth purchasing.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

I love the 3-in-1 sets, they have great value and are fun to build, but out of all of them, this is&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;of them all.<div>The 3 models are a Plane, a Space Shuttle and a Speed Boat. Here are my thoughts on each of them.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Plane</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't&nbsp;break easily, fun to play with, not to big, not small, looks cool. Very sturdy, an impressive model.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Space Shuttle</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;It's a cool looking model, but the bit on the back does break FAR to easily. Decent, but more of a display model.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Speedboat</div><div>It's the smallest model of the three, but it's fun to play with and&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;fall apart easily.</div><div>If you have an Aqua Raiders/Atlantis/Diver Mini-figure, this looks cool with them&nbsp;as well.</div><div><br></div><div>An overall AMAZING set, and great value!</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

I almost like the boat (tertiary model) better than the plane itself.<br><br><h4>Building Experience:</h4>Amazing - three in one is a great idea to make small sets more exciting.<br><br><h4>Parts:</h4>Not many new parts but it's rare to find some of them in orange.<br><br><h4>Playability:</h4>Wonderful - it's way bigger than I expected and this makes it very playable. I felt compelled to play, build and re-build like a child with his first LEGO set...<br><br><h4>Value for Money:</h4>I
paid
AUD$7 for this set - it was AUD$2 off. Worth every cent.<br><br><h4>Overall:</h4>Parts that are hard to find in orange and endless playability.",TRUE,5,3,5,4,5
"oscholes","2011-09-25T11:59:44.377Z","Mini Plane = Mini Fun","<p>First of all, I've always been a fan of the Creator 3-in-1 series. I 
think they're a great transition from building to someone else's design 
to building to your own design - seeing the same pieces arranged in 
three different ways is a real help in thinking about drawing up new 
designs. This kit, although it's small, is no exception - the three 
models are well designed and look very stylish - the orange is a nice 
colour addition. Great as a stocking-stuffer, or (as in my case) an 
impulse buy in the checkout at Toys-R-Us. Highly recommended for young 
and old builders alike, although experienced builders shouldn't expect 
anything challenging!</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,5
"Master_Wu","2019-07-18T15:22:52.847Z","Great set!","<p>I really like this set for multiple reasons: It&#39;s a small build, so it&#39;s more easily stored. This plane comes in a reusable plastic bin that it can be stored in. Also, it&#39;s a very fun build which also gives the option to build two other vehicles.</p>

<p>This set includes some great parts and it&#39;s worth the money for any Lego fan!</p>
