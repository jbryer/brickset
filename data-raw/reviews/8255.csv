seems like a step up from the smaller plastic box Creator sets in cost

<h4><br></h4><h4>Summary</h4><p>The first build is my personal favorite but the quad and 3-wheeler are pretty cool too. I'll keep it on display in the Dune Hopper form. I didn't keep track of what pieces were left over after each build but I'm sure there were a couple round 1x1's. The tires roll well over rough surfaces and the suspension is a nice touch. Def. adds to the play appeal. Holds together nicely.</p><p>I give it a thumbs up and a great Creator set for under $15 dollars.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
"Duq","2011-01-19T19:25:15.41Z","Just a very good little set","<p>In terms of parts count and price this set is the followup to 2010's 5866 Rotor Rescue. In terms of colour scheme and theme it's more like 5867 Super Speedster. So what does that give us?</p><p>Like most Creator sets this is a 3 in 1; The Dune Hopper that gave the set its name, a Quad bike and a Trike. I built all three, starting with the trike.</p><p>The trike is the afterthought of the set. It's dreadful. The proportions are all wrong, it has no steering and nothing that even tries to look like a front fork. Its only gimmick is the front suspension and it doesn't work. Push the front down and it won't come back up.</p><p>Next I built the quad bike. This looks pretty good. Here the proportions are spot on and the suspension works. It doesn't have steering but that's not as much of an issue as with the trike because it just looks right. This is definitely the second model in looks but to my surprise it uses fewer parts than the trike.</p><p>Finally I built the star of the show, the Dune Hopper. It's a good looking car that, like the other models, has suspension. It has some nice touches like those big headlights and the mirrors. Strangely it has a V-twin engine but that doesn't detract from the overall looks. Surprisingly it does not use all parts.</p><p>All three models use similar building techniques; they feature a similar setup for the suspension using just a handful of Technic parts and two elastic bands. They use some 1x2/2x2 brackets to attach a few pieces to the side and some hinge bricks and plates to add some detail on an angle. It's a very effective combination that produces interesting looking vehicles.</p><p>The parts selection is varied. A good few plates to form the base of the vehicles and some Technic pieces for the the suspension. Then there are tiles, slopes, clips (including the new 1x2 with clip on top in white) and handles for detailing. There are a few strange choices. For no particular reason two of the four 1x2 plates with arm up are yellow. There are also two of the new 1x4 plates with two studs at the ends but they don't have any purpose. The set would have looked the same with regular plates.<br></p><p>This is Lego as it's meant to be: with the varied selection of parts and the three very different models in the set as inspiration you can build an endless series of cool cars. For the 9 pounds I paid this is an excellent buy.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,5
"Gary_Bricks","2011-02-24T09:27:20.243Z","Amazing","<h4>5 out of 5 all over</h4><div>I honestly believe that this set is one of the finest ever Creator Models, well the first one anyway. The suspension is extra ordinary, I would never thought that Lego would come up with the rubber band for it, and neither would I. It comes with some handy orange pieces to.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-09-19T18:03:04.547Z","Probably the BEST LEGO set there's been in a very long time.","<p>Wow- thank goodness for LEGO Universe. Without it, I never would have won this contest, and I never would've&nbsp;received&nbsp;this amazing set. The beautiful yellow box it comes in was done very nicely, but the surprise inside the box is even greater.&nbsp;</p><p>Model 1, the&nbsp;<b>Dune Hopper</b>, is easily (in my opinion) the best out of the bunch. Very colorful, and closely resembles an actual dune hopper. The rear wheels and mufflers (I'm assuming those are what the things coming out of the side of the vehicle are) are represented by only one or two bricks, but it easily bears resemblance to real ones. I also love the built in suspension- it really adds a nice play element to the set.</p><p>Model 2, the <b>Trike, </b>is also very well done,&nbsp;but not the best. I don't find it to be my favorite, but the overall quality of it is pretty good. The handlebars can be adjusted, and the front wheel also has suspension, like the Dune Hopper with its back wheels.</p><p>The third and final model, the <b>Quad Bike </b>(or ATV, whatever you prefer), is a glorious build. The quality of the overall model is pretty amazing. This creation has suspension that resembles the Dune Hopper's, adding to the playability factor. It also shares the ability to adjust the handlebars with the Trike.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Well done models</li><li>Colorful pieces</li><li>Excellent building experience</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Not&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;a con, but it's not&nbsp;mini-figure&nbsp;scale. But who cares really?</li></ul>
<p>Well, what more can I say? The set is a masterpiece. If you have 13 bucks, pick it up. I regret not having bought many Creator sets in the past, because these models are just plain amazing. The purchase will most&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;be worth it, and a easy way to get a good set- at a low cost!</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
"Noctrian","2011-05-30T16:47:51.687Z","First real set of the year for me.","<p>I bought this set at Zellers Canada for $19.99. It was the cheapest set worth purchasing there, and is my first ""Creator"" set. I only constructed the Dune Hopper, and decided to keep that instead of going towards the other 2 possibilitys.&nbsp;</p><p>I was left with a few small pieces post-build, although nothing to notable. Most likely either used on the other variations or replacements for any lost pieces.</p><p>So, on to the Buggy itself!</p><p>I found that it was a rather quick build, only taking around 10 minutes, with one mistake on my part. The pieces are good if you are planning to construct other vehicles, as they are all rather easily found parts and can be used for a variety of things. <br></p><p>For play features, the Buggy has an open-able open air interior, with turning steering wheel. Although the wheel does not effect the steering of the buggy. It can fit a minifigure inside, but you will be unable to close the roof, making this not good for minifig use. The vehicle has rubber band suspension, witch is neat, and adds a realistic feel to the car, but I would have preferred for it to have suspension on both sets of wheels, instead of just the back. The wheels themselves roll smoothly along most surfaces, and perform well, even on carpet. <br></p><p><br></p><p>The spoiler on the back is a little bit annoying, and doesn't look good for my tastes, so I removed it after the build. I also removed the black bars in the front of the vehicle. With these removals the buggy almost feels like a classic vehicle, like something out of the early 1930s, this can be furthered by removing the roof as well. <br></p><p><br></p><br><br>In conclusion, this is a vehicle I highly recommend for most people who like Lego vehicles, I have not built all three variations, but I plan to in the future. <br>This is not a good car though, for Brickfilms or minifig play, due to its inability to support mini-figures without large modification. <br>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"chuping","2011-07-07T09:53:53.06Z","Good starting set for a 3 and half old kid","it is the first set for my son 3.5 years old. instruction is quite complete and friendly. he can handle almost all steps individually except one step that link for back wheels which is using technic parts. but he can do it after 2 times help. it is a good toy for my son. he divide and make it up several time in 2-3 weeks. it is much better than any other toys I bought for him.",FALSE,5,4,5,5,5
