It has very nice engine details, with a metallic silver radiator grill brick. The bright yellow nose cone is also very handy. It has simple landing pads and an adjustable back wing, also at the back is a small&nbsp;rotor.</div><div><br></div><div>The Truck</div><div><br></div><div>Overall very well detailed. Interesting pieces include the piece used for placing the lights and the bumper on Lego City Cars is used. Still scattered with amazing detail that will leave you in all</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
