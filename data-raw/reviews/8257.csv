I took my family to Legoland yesterday and for some reason I kept thinking&nbsp;they should make a&nbsp;Lego log cabin. On my way out, we stopped in the gift shop and I was pleasantly suprised to find this new set! <br>&nbsp;<br>Pros:<br><br>I really like the simple design, has nice a vintage look. <br><br>Includes a minifig, unlike many other creator houses. <br><br>Rear wall swings open, even with the roof on! <br><br>Canoe adds a lot of playability. <br><br>Nice details like BBQ pit and 'antler' decoration. <br><br>Includes a buildable tree, lots of brown pieces and some other hard-to-find stuff. <br><br>Great price: only 30 smackers!<br>&nbsp;<br>Cons:<br><br>Minifig needs a companion: a hunting buddy, fig-wife or even a dog to keep him company. <br><br>Attic window doesn't come with a windowpane. Seems like it would get pretty drafty. <br><br>Red roof looked brown on the box, I probably need my eyes checked. <br><br>Needs more interior than a fireplace, but don't they all? <br><br>Sides fall off the canoe a bit too easily and the rear wall is a bit bendy-wendy <br><br>Water plate should be larger, but I bought a blue baseplate to make this a lakeside cabin.

"Niallskie","2010-11-27T05:45:56.84Z","Cabin Fever","<p>Got this set from our local Lego Store on black friday... I was buying Pyramid of the Pharoah (7327) and was at the line already when I saw this set.&nbsp; No questions asked, I just have to get this set. Even got a nice 20% scratch it discount...niceeeeee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the review then... first thing that surprised me with this set was the price, saw this early on that day at TRU and the price was jacked up. $30 for this set I think is fairly awesome specially creator sets are 3 in 1. Actually the built was very basic and nothing really special, even the canou is really nothing special. No actual feature inside the cabin except the fire place, and thats basically it. I kinda expected more when I was checking the picture of this set a couple of weeks before I actually got it. Another huh for me is that, they could have given a printed torso for the minifigure... no biggie though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now on to the part I like with this set... one of the thing that impressed me was the tree, I know the build was the usual build, but the use of the pointy lego element, dont really know what to call it&nbsp;(usually used for teeth of creatures) was amazing. Simple as the element maybe, the way it was used was enlightingly new. I also loved how the cabin's entire back wall opens up for playability, as well as the roof detaches for&nbsp;more point of playability. Color scheme is awesome, I am very much liking the maroon brick they have been using for the 2011 sets. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though I did not like some stuff about this set, it does not change my over all appreciation of the set. This set is fantastic and is highly recommended for collectors who are wanting to expand their lego city. Have not tried to do the country cabin or river hut as of yet, but im sure it will be fantastic... and if the budget permits you can buy 2 more to display all 3 transformation of this set along with your collection.</p>

<ul><li>The rear wall swings out for easy interior access. This seems minor but is huge access wise versus popping the roof.

Especially the dark red/maroon roof bricks.</li><li>External details. The built tree, fire pit and rotisserie with 2 drumsticks, the canoe, antlers above side window (although as mentioned in another review, these would seem to fit better inside the cabin), front step, front lights/lanterns<br></li></ul>

<ul><li>The awesome tree falls off it's trunk quite easily (mentioned in another review)<br></li><li>Lack of internal details. I recommend the City Advent Calendar furniture as a quick fix :)</li><li>The base plates are small (mentioned in another review), but that means they accept studs on the bottom.<br></li></ul>
<p>The MSRP is pretty standard for the pieces that you get, seeing that it's not a licensed theme. Overall the Cabin is my favorite house in the Creator series to date. Great colors! Both of the other builds that you are given instructions for are good, one of them IMO being better than the featured build.I highly recommend any house/outdoor fan to pick one up.<br><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3

My other home sets are sharing minifigs and accessories from my City sets.</div><div><br></div><div>The lack of interior is the same as other Creator houses, so some additional bricks for furniture (wooden table, Adirondack chairs, etc...) would have been a nice touch. &nbsp;Especially because the back wall opens so smoothly and the roof comes off easily. &nbsp;It was designed to be played with.</div><div><br></div><div>The fireplace was a nice touch and the outdoor firepit with turkey legs (maybe) on a spit look great. &nbsp;I didn't have any of the bright orange&nbsp;translucent&nbsp;elements before, but they look great as embers and porch lights.</div><div><br></div><div>We are considering getting a couple more kits to allow a retreat-like area in our town beyond the farm. &nbsp;With the City House, Creator homes for the 'burbs, and now the Log Cabin, my minifigs have a choice of where to live. &nbsp;:)</div><div><br></div><div>Decent buy for the price and you get some unique colors, as well.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The first pro is definitely price. You get 355 pieces and essentially 3 different sets in one box for less than .10c/piece. I haven't seen that ratio in a SW set since they first came out.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The pieces are all quite standard, ones that have been around for ages. The pieces newest for me are the leaves on the tree. It was fun to build a set that didn't have a bunch of odd specialty pieces.</li><li>Pro 3: The build was fun and straight-forward. No repetitive builds and no stickers.</li><li>Pro 4: I like the features Lego put into the set, like the removable roof and the swing-out wall; the food roasting on a fire outside and the canoe and river. The ceiling even looks like it has 'exposed beams' in it, a nice touch. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: I would have liked to see a couple more trees, to give the set a real 'in the middle of the woods' affect. <br></li><li>Con 2: The interior is sparse. It would have been cool to have a cot or a table and chairs inside.<br></li></ul>

"Nesquik","2012-11-20T11:22:16.563Z","Fantastic Gift Idea","At 355 pieces, this set is actually better value than the images would suggest as it packs in so much detail within a small space. This is always the ratio to remember with Lego pricing - it's the quantity and size of the components themselves, not the scale of the final product. As such, the Log Cabin is good bang for the buck and makes an attractive gift option.<div><br></div><div>The main features of the showcase (Expert) Log Cabin model include a plain minifigure, a removable roof, a hinged back wall that allows more discreet access inside the cabin, a lovely fireplace, a little canoe for the minifigure to ride, a tall tree on its plate and a barbecue on the go... Looks tasty!<br><div><br></div><div>Unlike 'City' or other product lines that rely on specialised moulds for a design solution, the Creator range makes use of legacy components in order to build up detail and function. So, although the scale of the model would suggest it could have used less bricks, the final build is a much more satisfying (and classic) approach to model making. Many Lego fans appreciate this if they're somewhat overwhelmed or demoralised by the countless licensed sets out there.</div><div><br></div><div>This is apparent throughout the Log Cabin's design - the little canoe/boat has a very interesting build that is, in direct contrast to a 'City' approach, focused on clever techniques, rather a single mould. The roof of the cabin is a separate build, and is done so very much like a real life building (it can also be lifted off easily). Even the tree, which stands on its own small plate, is built from an array of nice components. It helps younger builders to think more about what they're doing, and to not just expect the solutions in favour of speed.</div><div><br></div><div>The Log Cabin has a really&nbsp;pleasing&nbsp;and almost sweet design from the outside; it just seems like the perfect retreat. I love the overlapping logs on the corners of the building, which suggests the roughness of the build. One of the best features of the product is actually the colours of the components - they're beautifully vibrant. It reminds me of many forest/nature sets from the 1990's.</div><div><br></div><div>Yet while the appearance is almost impossible to fault, the inside of the Log Cabin is a different story. I perfectly understand that the focus of the product is building techniques and design, but I'm surprised that the designers chose not to include any furniture. Not only would this have enhanced the playability of the product, but I feel it would make the inclusion of the minifigure a bit more justified, because all he can really do is go for walks and ride his canoe. Perhaps it came down to cost goals and space saving.</div><div><div><br></div><div>Another thing I am surprised at is that a Light Brick wasn't included for the fire place. This would have made an excellent addition to the interior and thus create some sort of cosy light source, but again, it's absence can understandably be put down to space saving and use within the other two designs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, I note that one reviewer mentioned the lack of a window pane in the upper frame of the Log Cabin. The reason for this I would have thought is fairly obvious; it's a log cabin, and made from materials that can be found in the forest. Anglian Glazing is a bit too far to walk to!</div><div><br></div><div>The other two models that can be built in this product are a bit weak for a Creator set, so I don't feel they deserve much attention. They are nice easy builds, but I imagine even a child would find them a bit boring. I'm wouldn't allow this to detract from the value of the product though, because the Log Cabin itself is something you wouldn't want to break up.</div><div><br></div><div>In short, the Log Cabin may not be the most complete addition to the Creator series, but I think it has bundles of playability and a wonderful exterior design to go with it (plus, it's up against some stiff competition with the likes of the 'Lighthouse' and the 'Seaside House'. Older children and adults will most certainly want to purchase this purely as a showpiece, and younger children will enjoy having this as a contrast to existing City products. It's classic Lego, and I love it to bits!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4

<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>The set comes with one&nbsp;unnamed&nbsp;minifigure, he has a red baseball cap, a smiling yellow face, a blue torso and beige legs.</div><div><br></div><div>The figure goes just great with this set as it is just a plain house.

Although this set does not come with any pieces to decorate the inside of the log cabin other than the cool fireplace corresponding to the chimney at the top, it still offers some space (not much) inside for you to do that yourself with whatever you want, to decorate the inside of the log cabin of your content.</p><div><br></div><div>The tree is quite unusual, you'd expect for a regular LEGO tree to be thrown in like the other house sets, but this set has a more creative tree and it leans towards one side so it won't bump into the log cabin's exterior wall. There's also a small campfire outside with two drumsticks roasting (you can even turn them around using the end of the stick both clockwise and counter-clockwise), two tree stumps, a plain minifigure with a typical outfit (but useful) that comes with a canoe paddle, and a canoe which is supposed to be ""parked"" on the blue water plate to the left of the log cabin. The colors are great, and it was great to build. I can only wonder why there is no window for the attic? It looks like a missing piece but it's not.&nbsp;</div><p></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great design.</li><li>This set has a lot of playability.</li><li>Detachable roof for inside play.</li><li>The back wall of this set can open and close for inside play.</li><li>This set comes with a minifigure and a canoe.</li><li>The tree has a cool, and more creative design.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Not enough space inside for decorations.</li><li>Plain interior floor, has none at all other than the green plate.</li><li>Due to the tree's weight, it falls off a lot.</li><li>Attic window has no window piece.</li></ul>
<p>A reasonable price in the Creator theme, matching colors, great playability, a few flaws, but for the most part this is still a great set. This set is very flexible and can be customized a lot. Overall I give this set a four out of five.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Trueblox","2016-04-29T15:19:43.91Z","Best lego creator set so far!","<p>Hello! i am Trueblox Gaming! for today, i will review this set! link to&nbsp;my youtube:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsb80_mgl-MGx3lBPDnln3g</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>the box art is fine, and the box is not that big, comes with 2 or 3 instructions ( i cannot remember ) one for every building, ( or&nbsp; instruction 1 for the cabin and instruction 2 for the other ones )</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>there are a more &quot; medium &quot; amount of bricks and some plates.</p>

<h3>The&nbsp;Minifigure</h3>

<p>the Minifigure is a guy with bej pants, blue shirt with white sleeves, a red hat and a backpack.</p>

<h3>The builds</h3>

<p>the first build i will talk about is the Log Cabin. it took me half an hour to build it. i liked building the boat, since it has a nice model.</p>

<p>the second build i will talk about is a small house that can open in 2 sides. one is the entrace the second is a pond with a duck on it. it took me 30 minutes to build this one.</p>

<p>the third and final build is another smaller house with a grill next to it and a small bridge over a lake. this build took me once again, 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>The completed models</h3>

<p>the first model is the Log Cabin. it looked really good, with the small river next to it for the boat, a small fireplace for grilling that sweet, sweet chicken :D</p>

<p>the second model is the small house that can open. i was satisfied by it, cause it was the first building i had that could open in 2 sides.</p>

<p>the third and final model is the small house with the grill and bridge. the bridge was good, because its my first bridge i built. same goes for the grill, loved the details.very good details for the grill, as for the house, it has some walls, and half of the walls are some&nbsp;roofs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>this set is good, good playability, good models and good details. i recommend it to every lego fan like me.</p>

"h734802","2021-05-04T09:52:05.3Z","My wife bought it","<p>&nbsp;One day my wife bought this set just because.</p>

<p>&nbsp;We love log and beam houses (who doesn&#39;t) so at least we have one until we get a real one...</p>

<p>&nbsp;Cute small house. Maybe bigger one with more space inside would be better. That was the only reason I didn&#39;t give it 5 in the <em>overall rating</em> and <em>playability</em>. I like Techinc after all, and it has a trend to make the sets as functional or realistic as it is possible. Some kind of similar trend would be super in the Creator sets also like the Colosseum. In the case of log houses they could be bigger with realistic life space inside for a minifig.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I checked the D-models here and they are awesome. I will build all of them just for fun and to try which one I like the most.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I can offer this set for every age. For the older ones just as a decoration somewhere in their house. By the way I have a <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42100-1/Liebherr-R-9800"">42100 Liebherr R 9800</a> (I wrote a <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/59914"">review</a> on it also) and its size just fits to the sets in the size of a minifig. It can demolish and clear houses and whatever, so you can play together with those kinds of sets, like this log cabin as well.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Looks good on the shelf.</li>
	<li>Good toy for a kid especially with other similar houses.</li>
	<li>Minifig size.</li>
	<li>Many custom D-models.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Con</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Small space inside and the lack of interior. It is just a matter of trend to make things more realistic in Creator sets also.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a good Lego time.</p>

<p><em>Hi, I live here and work nearby with this excavator. And I can demolish my own house...</em></p>
