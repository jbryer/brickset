<p>He has about six or seven Duplo figures, but the girl with the magenta hoodie is his favorite.</p>
<p>There are some great pieces in this set.&nbsp; The corn, apples, and oranges fit in the crates and a crate fits inside the van.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The van is fantastic and even the cat can drive it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We use the cash register as a computer and make it say &quot;beep beep beep&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There is a 2 x 2 Duplo block with a nice strawberry print.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As with most Duplo sets, these are blended in with the rest of his sets, but these pieces are standouts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is definitely one of the better Duplo sets.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
