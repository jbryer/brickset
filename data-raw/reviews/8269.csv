"Lucem","2010-12-13T20:04:56.337Z","Hasn't been released yet","So, this set hasn't been released yet, so I'm gonna do a blind review. As in, I'm going to review this set based off of pictures I've seen. Also, I just randomly rated this thing. XD<br><br>First off, the pieces. The fists are new, and they have been molded so that they have 4 fingers, and the inside isn't filled in. Yay! Now, the body. It looks pretty interesting. While it's skinny, the waist is connected to the body (just like with the original heroes), a feature we never saw with Bionicles. The head is new, and it looks pretty interesting (also). The helmet is 2 pieces, but I'm not really fond of the the little helmet accessory. Also, the weapon has LEGO pieces on them which kinda gives it a LEGO feel. Also, he comes with light blue spears that are flexible! Also, he comes with a new hero core, which is the top half of the original hero cores. Sadly, it is made with solid plastic. It is no longer translucent.<br><br>Joints. These guys are a big improvement to the original heroes (joint wise). The legs, and arms can move! At the first sight of the 2.0 series poster on the LEGO January calender, I thought that the arms on all the heroes were the arms/legs from the original heroes, just with fancy armor.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>- JOINTS! YES!<br><br>- Nice armor<br><br>- Cool new pieces<br><br>Cons:<br><br>- Helmet accessories<br><br>- New hero cores<br><br>- Hasn't come out yet. Don't let us starve LEGO!<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Kalhiki","2010-12-26T09:10:06.573Z","I'm going to go with the cliche ""Awesome Set""","Got this for Christmas, and I'm loving it. Where should I start? <br>(if you don't want to read the whole review, skip to the overall where I sum everything up)<br><br>BUILDING EXPERIENCE: If you're new to Hero Factory and the 2011 sets are your first figures, it won't be anything new. But if you were a Bionicle fan or liked the 2010 Heroes, the building is completely different. It's basically all ball joints and rods (like the kind you can put in minifig hands).As a matter of fact, there are only three connections that are Technic (2 axles, one pin). But overall, the building experience was quite fun.<br><br>PARTS: All... Well, most... of the parts are new molds.The only reused parts are the orange bulb on his helmet, the tube, and the spears (which could be new. I don't know if they've been rubbery before).As for interesting pieces, you have the armor, limbs, helmet, hand (which has four fingers and a thumb), the weapon, and the tube, which is transparent with blue inside it. It's kinda like Meltdown's tubes only instead of green, it's blue. I'm not going to get into detail, I'll leave it a surprise for you.<br><br>PLAYABILITY: Playability is much better than last year's Heroes, and all small sets for that matter. Stormer (and the other Heroes) has knees and elbows. This way you can get him into some excellent poses.<br><br>COMPLAINTS: I have few complaints about this set, and the ones I do are very minor. First of all, he only has one hand. The other arm has his weapon. Second, the body armor kinda wobbles, but that's not too bad. Finally, his feet are big. From some poses, they don't look as big, and they look smaller in person, but they're still there.<br><br>OVERALL: I highly recommend him. The building was fun and new, the parts are great and are all new molds, he has elbow and knee joints, and my few complaints are very minor. Plus, eight bucks is a steal for what you get: an awesome, well articulated figure. If you see him in the store, definitely pick him up.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"NickBrick","2011-02-26T21:13:14.827Z","A breakthrogh in design and some new parts make this set pretty intresting.","When I first saw the pictures of the 2.0 Heroes I just about threw up. they had strange weapons, blocky parts, and from the looks of em...no transparent parts! And when I bought the set thats just what I got. But hear me out, for I got a surprise.&nbsp; I had been hearing about <br>some sort of modification on the old Inika build and decided&nbsp; that I'd pick up Stormer 2.0<br>The new build is actually quite good! and almost double the pieces? Man! Lego is finally listening to our pleas to up the piece counts! WEAPONS: Like I said above, weird. Its a combination of Breez 2.0's and Evo 2.0's weapons except in different colors. Oh yeah, and the spears are rubber too. However, we do get a very interesting new hook piece. With all sorts of sharp edges and even some holes for expansion the weapons get an overall score of 3.8<br>ARMOR AND HELMET: Blocky. Very blocky. This is the worst part of the set. while fun to snap on it looks like someone just took a bunch of building blocks and put them on a stick figure. Thankfully a new printed armor peice is included and is great for giving MOCs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personality The helmet is small but the section covering the eye&nbsp; makes him look really good. overall score: 3.9<br>POSEABILITY AND OVERALL SCORE: The 2.0s are much better when is comes to making interesting poses. You can make do all sorts of stuff. Much much better that the old heroes.<br>For $7.99 Stormer 2.0 is worth the money. He is good for a first 2.0 hero. however I like Evo 2.0 better. Final score: 4.2 Hope I was helpful. Ill be reviewing Evo 2.0 and Von Nebula soon.<br><br>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

"QuickBricks","2011-03-07T09:35:54.647Z","An Unexpected Surprise...","I bought this set yesterday and was very pleasantly surprised! I thought that it would stink because it looks nothing like the original Preston Stormer. I bought him anyway, however, because Stormer is my favorite hero and I had to stay up to date, right? Well, my disillusion was quickly dissipated as soon as I had opened up the canister. I must say that it is pretty impressive. The tube that extends from Stormer's back to his weapon is transparent, except for a blue streak that runs down the middle of it. His head and Hero Core are solid blue, and the printed piece that says ""Stormer 2.0"" on the top of the left arm is pretty cool as well. The light at the top of his headgear is transparent orange, and the GPS and thermal indicators that are mentioned on the sight are not there, the eyepiece just has some markings on it that would indicate such devices. One more thing about the pieces that needs to be mentioned is that the spears on his weapon are rubbery. The flexibility on this hero is excellent as well, and it allows a whole lot more poseablility to Stormer. Lastly, the code in the top of the canister grants you access to play the new game ""Creep Crushers"" as Stormer on www.herofactory.lego.com. Overall, a great set. Don't let the appearance on the canister deter you from buying this awesome hero!<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-12T10:05:03.54Z","LEGO HERO Factory - Stormer 2.0 Review","This figure is a very cool figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers. The legs, the feet, the arms, the hands and the head can be moved and one arm has a nice looking shield with two blue spears which are rubbery for some reason. As I told you in the beginning: It's a very cool figure to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"KodakKid365","2011-03-12T09:08:39.457Z","Very nice set.","Stormer's head is cool, and the weapon is as well. The only problem with the weapon is that it only has one blade, and it's a lot better with two. The tube looks great. Another problem is that his normal arm is to short. Stormer is the tallest hero. I totally recommend him to you. he could lead the Alpha team in to battle against the Fire Lord any day.",FALSE,4,4,4,4,4
"flarefish","2014-12-01T08:17:14.003Z","Ultra building ice type","<p>This guy is already cool being a ice type ( get it ) but this is the first set that I saw that used the ultimate&nbsp;builder system meaning this guy was one of the most special sets I ever saw because of that cool new building type. Sadly this set&#39;s back is completely bare just like all the 2.0 hero&#39;s. Stormer&nbsp;has&nbsp;a really&nbsp;cool gun,&nbsp;awesome shield&nbsp;and&nbsp;a wire going into his back. His head is really decked out with a light,&nbsp;helmet and more. This set is rather thin but that does mean&nbsp;you can stand it up easily. Stormer&#39;s chest is made up of 3 parts: the base, the chestplate and the Hero Core. All together Stormer&nbsp;is a small set and quite a cool looking one if you ignore the back.</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p>First time I saw the ultimate builder system.</p>

<p>Really good chestplate.</p>

<p>Light bulb eye.</p>

<p>Epic gun</p>

<p>Easy to stand up.</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>Bare back.</p>

<p>Small.</p>

<p>Thin</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My rating out of ten is 7.</p>
