</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Not much to discuss here. It's the same canister design, except with an orange lid like all other Heroes. What's interesting is on the back is a picture of a possible combiner you can make with Evo, though any Hero really would work to make a unique combiner. The underside of the lid also has the code for the new Creep Crushers game.<br></p><p>The instructions aren't anything new and doesn't really need to be discussed<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>All (well, most) of the parts are new. The only ones that are old are the lightsaber rods (in a very nice blue) and a socket (however, it's remolded into the new-style sockets). Speaking of which, all sockets are new, strong, and won't break. So don't worry about taking him apart. I'm not going to go over every part; I'll leave it a surprise.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>None. It's a constraction figure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It was pretty simple. However, you'll definitely need the instructions to know where to place the armor. Also to note is that the connections are all ball joints or lightsaber rod sized holes (like a minfig could hold). There wasn't anyhing special other than that, though.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The finished model looks fantastic. It has much welcome poseability that was missing in the 1.0 Heroes, and a very unique design. Those familiar with the look of Bionicle will be in for a shock. There is hardly any molded details, which leaves a nice smooth look. The only thing I can complain about is that he only has one hand, and the goggles. The hand thing, you can't fix, but it really isn't all that noticeable. The goggles you can fix. All you need to do is flip around the headgear (which is a separate piece from the helmet), which gives you a visor. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all, he's a very good set, and I highly recommend him. If you're a MoCist, you'll be happy with the number of pieces and new molds you get. If you're a collector, he'll look great on your shelf with his striking red. If you play with you're sets, the added joints will provide hours of fun. I highly recommend him. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Huw","2011-02-12T15:56:40.39Z","Bionicle evolved","<p>Since 2001 I've bought every red Bionicle (and now Hero Factory) so as to keep abreast with the line's evolution. </p>
<p>Last year's Hero Factory models&nbsp;were pretty much the same as the Bionicles that preceded them: many of the parts were the same and the untrained eye would struggle to tell them apart.</p>
<p>This year's 'v2.0' models are quite different, though. It's as if LEGO didn't want to invest too heavily in tooling up for HERO Factory in case it flopped the first year. But, presumably it didn't and now, in 2011, we have models made from almost all new parts, with new connection points and methods. Gone is the reliance on Technic pin or axle holes and connectors, now most of the parts clip onto balls half-way up each limb section, or via two non-standard holes. This is not necessarily better, but it is different, and an interesting evolution.</p>
<p>Furno 2.0 is very different from 1.0, but looking at the trade catalogue pictures of Furno 3.0, due out in the summer, if we are to think of them in software release terms (which presumably we are given the version numbers) I think a minor release number, v2.1,&nbsp;would have been more appropriate: it looks much the same as 2.0 with a couple of new parts.</p>
