"HeroFactoryDude316","2010-12-30T00:11:45.01Z","EVO IS AWESOME!","I got this bad boy from a TRU a few days ago. I also got Stormer 2.0 and Jetbug with which was good. But let me tell you he's awesome!<br><br>Building experience: This is an amazing build. The armor&nbsp; snaps on the joints instead of attaching them the bionicle way. I heard that the first&nbsp; sets weren't good&nbsp; with building but from pics of the others I can tell this is a step up. 5/5<br><br>Parts: These parts are amazing. First off the snap on armor pieces are amazing. One of them also is gray and has Evo 2.0 printed on it. I also like his chest plate and PURPLE hero core. The helmet visor whatever it is piece is nice too and go's well with the set. The best pieces are the purple ones. The purple spike stands out and the head is nice too. His weapon is good and I like the use of spears. 5/5<br><br>Playability: The playability is great with this set. Unlike others you don't have to have another hero or villain to go with it. There are&nbsp; tons of great poses and I amused myself by posing him in different positions. 5/5<br><br>Complaints: ABSOLUTELY NONE!<br><br>Overall: Overall this is a great set. It's good to get for people who like Bionicle and Lego's like that. I highly recommend this to anyone that likes Hero Factory. 5/5 <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"ggggggggggggggggggggggggg","2011-05-08T14:30:01.717Z","Evo 2.0","I bought Evo 2.0 when in bristol, my brother also bought Stormer 2.0. This was my first hero factory set, as the first wave of hero's didn't appeal, when I opened the canister I was delighted to see the wealth of new moulds and the new way of adding armour, the build was intresting, but I imagine it being repetive with your secound hero, but Evo's parts were excellent, you get two 3 sized armour units in yellow, two 4 sized armour units in yellow, this bulky armour unit in yellow, and a printed size 5 gunmetal armour unit., you get three purple pieces including a spike, head and the hero core, there are other parts of interest, but I don't intend for this to be a lengthy review. Evo is playable as he has multiple points of articulation meaning you can pose him alot, and get him in heroic poses to fight of villains!<br>In conclusion, I would recommend Evo to a bionicle or HF fan and I found him a very good set.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4

"NickBrick","2011-03-02T20:37:59.973Z","Time to bring down the house!","Just as I promised hear is a review for Evo 2.0 <br>Compared to the other 2.0 heroes Evo 2.0 stands out as one of the better ones.<br>His legs are not as long as Stormer 2.0 (thankfully) the weapon is bigger than his as well.<br>Sadly the spears are still rubber but since they are in a more realistic its forgivable.<br>Something very interesting about this set is that Evo 2.0 is the first Hero factory/Bionicle figure to actually be bright Lego yellow instead of the that weird faded yellow we've been seeing for so long.<br>The head gear is also slightly better than Stormer 2.0 being bigger and in dark metallic gray.<br><p>The hero core is smaller than past heroes and is the first purple core. Its also solid purple. While certainly not a bad thing since its a somewhat new color I would have preferred it to be transparent. Evo 2.0 also has one of the problems that Stormer had. the armor is bulky and smooth, making seem as if someone just slapped some parts on a skeleton.</p><p>Overall Evo 2.0 is much better than Stormer 2.0 A new color and a huge weapon as well as <br></p><p>not being quite as bulky brings the points up to 5 and I definitely recommend this set, totally worth the price. hope I was helpful.

"KodakKid365","2011-04-01T09:31:38.23Z","Very Nice Set","Evo has cool head gear, and great armor. His color scheme is just amazing. His weapon is cool, but the only problem is the spear parts in it. They are rubber, and sometimes it woibbles around. I reccomend this set.",FALSE,4,4,4,4,4
"exo_force_fan200","2011-05-28T10:23:30.097Z","A new building technique, all new parts, and amazing colors.","<p>Personally, I loved this set. &nbsp;Every Lego fan should get at least one, if not two, of the new Heroes. &nbsp;I got Evo in addition to Breez 2.0 and Jetbug at Target, and he was very satisfactory. &nbsp;He includes all new pieces- only one (The ""hand"" that holds the weapon) isn't new. &nbsp;The color scheme is very nice, though there were only three purple pieces- the Hero Core, head, and spike. &nbsp;He could have had more spikes, but the one sort of gives him a ""bad boy"" look, which he is not. &nbsp;Well, it depends on whether you follow the... ah, never mind. &nbsp;Back to the review. &nbsp;Evo is the only one of the Heroes that does not get upgraded to 3.0 to have the ice shield, so if, like me, you are picky about your roleplays and want to use a character that both has the ice shield and will not be upgraded (Because upgrading him would force you to buy the new version in order to keep playing with him accurately), Evo is your only option. &nbsp;The new building system is very nice, with snap-on armor and almost nothing but balls and joints. &nbsp;Interesting note: The spikes on Evo's ice shield are actually made of rubber, so they are in fact new pieces like so much of the set. &nbsp;Overall, Evo is a very good set. &nbsp;Buy at least one of the new Heroes.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
