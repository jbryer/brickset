"Funnguston","2011-01-21T17:45:02.557Z","New Heros, New Design","<p>I recently purchased this figure from my local target store for $7.99 (the same price as the first series figures). After opening this set I was happily surprized to see that no sticker sheet fell out along with the pieces and instructions. The one piece the Nex's leg that I expected to be a sticker is actually printed right on the piece itself (and looks pretty good imo). The build was very different from previous technic figure sets because of a new version of the connection pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the standard ball and socket pieces with plus connections have been refitted with ball connections instead which allow for snap on parts which make these figures' parts quickly interchangeable, yet the pieces of armor hold together like the normal socket connections. The armor pieces that that normally would have plus connections aswell now are much smoother in appearance and only have 2 small hole connections the could be fitted with a normal lego rod or other pieces of armor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost every piece in this set is brand new which is a big plus, plus they cost the same amount as the first series of figures, yet have about double the pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this figure (and the rest of the 2.0 figures)&nbsp;are very different from past ones, the improvements made work very well for them, even though they may not work as well for larger scale mocs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you enjoy poseable figures and legos, then you should love this figure, but if you are looking for more of the classic style of techic figure set, this is may not be&nbsp;one for you.</p>

"diehardlegofan","2011-03-06T12:51:41.143Z","Nice Design, Humble Yet Confident","I fell in love with these new Heroes; Nex 2.0 is definitely on of my favorites. &nbsp;He has a wonderful color scheme (as does all the 2.0 figures), a great layout of his armor which gives him major personality, and the pieces are designed very well and can easily be used for MOCing.<br><br><br><b>THE PIECES:</b><br>These new piece designs are simply genius. &nbsp;You can really see that the LEGO designers worked VERY hard on these pieces. &nbsp;The pieces are detailed enough so they don't look boring, but simple enough so you don't get a head ache for looking at them. &nbsp;I love the five-fingered hand piece and the ""water gun"". &nbsp;The Hero Core I could care less about, I did sort of like the core being transparent, but a solid color looks okay. &nbsp;The helmet, I think, looks a lot like a football helmet, and the chest piece looks a little bit like the pads they have in football. &nbsp;But other than a few minor cons, these are excellent pieces for MOCing BIONICLE figures and Hero Factory figures. &nbsp;Overall, if you are a MOCer, these pieces should be a necessity to your collection.&nbsp;<br><br><b>THE BUILD:</b><br><div>The build is very straightforward; harder than the first wave of heroes, but simple enough so that you don't really HAVE to look at the instructions. &nbsp;But aside from the ease of the build, I did find it rather entertaining. &nbsp;I have learned that if you pay attention to how LEGO designers find different techniques to build the product, you may find different techniques to build your own creation. &nbsp;<br><br><b>THE</b>&nbsp;<b>FINISHED PRODUCT:</b><br>Very nice. &nbsp;I like how LEGO made the shoulders on the torso piece closer together; with the shoulder less broad it gives Nex 2.0 a humble, yet confident look to him. &nbsp;Highly articulated, although some joins are hindered by the layout of the armor, you can rearrange the armor in any way you please. &nbsp;Also, like I said about the pieces, I think this figure looks a little bit like a futuristic robot football player, but that's just me. &nbsp;<br><br><b>OVERALL:</b><br>This figure is very nice, and I highly recommend it. &nbsp;If you are a newcomer for this Hero Factory 2.0 theme, I recommend you get Nex and Evo 2.0 before you get any other figure.</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"BrickMaster_99","2011-03-20T18:57:45.42Z","A New Addition To The Team","Nex 2.0 is a very good set. First, his weapon consists of blackish-gray pinchers, two buzz saws, and two dark blue lightsaber blades for his blaster. His headset contains&nbsp;a miniature buzz saw and two lights on his left, and pliers on his right. Over all this is a great set.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,4,5,4
"lewa99","2011-03-08T10:25:14.143Z","Nex is awesome - but his pieces are even better","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nex is a pretty nice figure. He utilizes the new style of building system&nbsp;which integrates well with other pieces in this building system well, not only physically but from&nbsp;an&nbsp;aesthetic&nbsp;point of view. The figure itself is sturdy, with a nice sheild, and a helmet&nbsp;resembling&nbsp;an American football helmet, reenforcing the vibe you get from the character. The ony place he doesn&#39;t look so great is from behind, where the new armor pieces do a poor job covering his skeleton.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The skeleton however, is extremely poseable. Nex can be put in pretty much&nbsp;any&nbsp;pose you can think of, as long as he is balanced. I can&#39;t wait to see what the future will bring for this great building system.</p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-12T10:11:06.197Z","LEGO HERO Factory - Nex 2.0 Review","This is a really cool figure to have and it's also nice to play with. The build is very nice and easy and we don't have to worry about stickers as well. The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and he head can e moved and one arm has a nice looking shield with two translucent blue lightsaber blades. This blue is a little bit darker than the ones we've seen in the lightsabers we get from the LEGO Star Wars theme. The shield also has two chainsaws. As I told you in the beginning: It's a very cool figure to have - even for pieces which you can use for 
future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

His head is made up of three or four peices instead of just one which makes him much more cool. He is also is not monochromatic, he is multicolored unlike most Hero Factories and Bionicles.

<p>But anyway, on to the review!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box shows Nex posing for the camera ignoring the destruction that the fire villains are causing, hope he turns around soon!</p>
<p>The instructions were fine, no gliches.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set has a fair amount of parts, good for Mocing, especially the pieces for the weapon.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build is just like all the other Heroes, but of course, it's the first time TLG used this building style, and it FUN!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Nex 2.0&nbsp; is a very good set, and he looks like a carrot!</p>
<p>He has amazing posability compared to the old Heroes, and the weapon is very cool,&nbsp;it changes from&nbsp;an ice shooter and claw to a pair of buzz saws.</p>

It also shows Hero Factory HQ.</p><p>On the back, we have the combiner, his MHC (Mighty Hero Core) in 1:1 scale and his combiner.</p><p>The instructions have 18 pages of building, and some ads.</p>

There are 7 A 3-long armor pieces in orange, one A 5-long white armor with a printing, and a white body.&nbsp;</p><p>One orange MTIS (Multi-Tool Ice Shield), two gunmetal claws w/ saws at the end, &nbsp;two lightsabers in transluscent blue and a socket makes the weapon.</p><p>Orange feet and fist, one spike in dark green (or Mata green), his MHC in dark green, as well as a head , a cap in orange and a cool headgear in gunmetal.

<h4>The build</h4><p>Actually simple. Simple and quick! Almost everything connects with a ball joint.</p>

<br />
Pros to buying this set:</p>

<p>&mdash;&nbsp;Nice parts.<br />
<br />
This set has&nbsp;nice parts overall. If you&#39;re making an orange Moc, this set could be a nice addition.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&mdash; Good playability.<br />
<br />
This set is more playable than most sets at this time.</p>

<p>Cons to buying this set:<br />
<br />
&mdash; One hand.<br />
<br />
This set only has one hand, thus you&#39;d have to buy two to get a second hand.<br />
<br />
This set is nice overall. I recommend buying it if you&#39;re assembling Mocs or just assembling a Hero Factory collection!<br />
