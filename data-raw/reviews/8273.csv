First off-can Breez 2.0 really be female? Well yes, but would anyone guess that from anything but name? No.
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>We have the standard Canister for Breez. Pretty great scenery, although it would make more sense to fight Drilldozer instead of poze behind his onslaught of fire. The instructions were curled, but in better condition than those from large sets have been.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are really cool-however, they have major problems. You cannot re-use them without using the armor-the armor is cool from some sides, but due to it's of a back, it really isn't your best option for building. There are really nice new arm/torso pieces, but they all require a sock joint piece, and there isn't much you can do to armor those. With those, it turns a great building theme into a mix 'n' match. There are 2 red swords and the head's pretty cool. The weapons are underpowered though.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>Not enough. It's really just stick together and snap on. Plus place a few accessories on the armor. As if HF 1.0 was easy enough already.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Great for playing-that was the intention. Due to reusability of parts, I'm basically getting an action figure for more money. It's posable in every way, but it really looks bad when you can see the inside of the armor.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Well, if any of you want HF 2.0, go ahead. It's easier, a lot of mix 'n' match opportunities, more TECHNIC parts, etc-but be warned, this is more like an action figure with armor that can be taken off and switched with others, instead of a building toy.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,2,5,3

I mean, the only girl, and she gets a full faced helm? The color scheme is like a girl, not saying it's bad, but the only problem is the daggers. Ok, so in real life, some people do hold daggers like that, but with her, she looks better, but she can't actualy stab anything, except her own arm, unless you flip it right side up, which makes it look stupid.",FALSE,4,4,3,4,4
"exo_force_fan200","2011-05-28T17:39:03.273Z","Is green still my color?","Ladies and gentlemen, Breez 2.0! &nbsp;She can turn invisible. &nbsp;She has multiple tools on her blades. &nbsp;And she is looking fashionable in green! &nbsp;(This is based off a quote from the TV show.)<div><br></div><div>Alright, Breez 2.0, the only female 2.0 Hero. &nbsp;In fact, she's the only female Hero ever so far.</div><div><br></div><div>Building:</div><div><br></div><div>The building experience was good overall. &nbsp;If you've built one 2.0 Hero, you're built them all, and I'd built Evo 2.0 before her, so it wasn't anything new for me, but it was still a nice change from the Avotoran and Inika builds we've had for 3 and 5 years, respectively. &nbsp;First, you attach the upper arms and legs, in black. &nbsp;These are new molds for the new system, so if it's your first 2.0 build, even this simple step will be fun for you. &nbsp;Next, you attach the lower legs. &nbsp;These are also new molds, also in black. &nbsp;Then come the lime green feet. &nbsp;After that, you start putting on armor. &nbsp;The new snap-on system, which for the first time uses balls and sockets to put on armor, is fun if it's the first time doing it, like the rest of the set, and is supposed to be easy. &nbsp;More armor is then attached. &nbsp;Note that the set is very asymmetrical, starting on this step with the difference between the upper leg armor pieces: one is Breez's identification plate, and the other is basic size one new armor. &nbsp;The black lower arms are now attached, and *gasp*! &nbsp;They don't reach below the knees! &nbsp;Lego has actually made an action figure with correct proportions! &nbsp;The universe is coming to an end!</div><div><br></div><div>And apparently it's not. &nbsp;Back to the review. &nbsp;Lime green hands are next, new ones with 4 fingers and a thumb instead of 3 and a thumb. &nbsp;More asymmetrical armor is now added, then the spikes for this armor. &nbsp;The red is nice, but there's only 4 pieces of that color in this set, which is a bit of a let-down. &nbsp;Next is the new 2-piece snap-on chest armor with red Hero Core, then the red head with grey visor and lime helmet. &nbsp;A little disappointing is the fact that the helmet cannot be attached to the head without attaching the visor first, forcing you to use the visor. &nbsp;Even more disappointing is the fact that the heads are completely identical among all the 2.0 Heroes. &nbsp;The visors and colors are the only things that tell them apart. &nbsp;Finally are Breez's weapons: ""Multi-Tool Blades"". &nbsp;One of these, the left one, is awesome, and depending on your opinion, is even more awesome because it is held back-handedly. &nbsp;The other, the right one, is a bit of a let-down because it's very short.</div><div><br></div><div>Playability:</div><div><br></div><div>Breez can be fun to play with. &nbsp;She has the standard 13 points of articulation, allowing her to bend at her ankles, knees, hips, neck, shoulders, elbows, and wrists which DO NOT GO BELOW HER KNEES, UNLIKE <i>SOME</i>&nbsp;CREATURES *cough*Bionicle*cough*</div><div><br></div><div>The left weapon, again, can be used as a very cool back handed sword, but the right one is just ridiculous because of it's small length. &nbsp;It can be fun to pretend it's a boomerang, though, as with that curved end, it is very easy to imagine it whipping through the air with the cliche bad-guy-ducks-it-flies-behind-him/her-then-comes-back-and-knocks-them-over happening. &nbsp;That's pretty much all there is to say about that.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros and Cons:</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><br></div><div>COMPLETELY NEW BUILDING SYSTEM</div><div>NOTHING BUT NEW PIECES</div><div>Green</div><div>Red</div><div>Visor</div><div>Left weapon</div><div>Asymmetry</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div><br></div><div>Can't really tell it's Breez</div><div>Visor</div><div>Right weapon</div><div>Lack of red</div><div>Helmet is the same as the rest</div><div>Asymmetry</div><div><br></div><div>Overall: 5/5</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

I found 14 pieces which I haven't seen before. First of the arms, the legs, the hands, the feet and the head are movable. What I found interesting is the way how you stick on the elements: LEGO uses new limbs with balls where you have to put the pieces on. Also the head piece is really cool. It is made out of 3 pieces which I'm going to show you in my YouTube video (I've put in a link to this video at the end of this review). I also like the new weapon pieces which LEGO has given Breez 2.0. As you can see in my YouTube video the new Natalie Breez version is a little bit bigger than the William Furno figure from 2010 and she's as tall as the first Toa Tahu from the BIONICLE theme which came out in 2001.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Positive:</span><br><br>Great pieces which you can youse for brickfilms or MOC's<br>Nice starter set<br>No stickers<br>New pieces<br><br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Negative:</span><br><br>Not so many play features<br>No minifigs<br><br><br>All
