<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to the first wave of hero factory villans, this one, amongst the others in the second wave, are not worth the money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plastic is thinner, lighter, cheaper than the first wave.&nbsp; The appeal, well there is no appeal to the villans at all when comparing them to the first wave.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drilldozer is plain, and like other ones in wave two have these annoying red spikes.&nbsp; There could have been a better choice design wise to add detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would not recommend the second wave at all.&nbsp; The first wave yes.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is a box. It's a little smaller in depth (from the front face to the back face) than the first wave of villains, but I guess that's good. We also get a nice picture of Drilldozer on the front drilling the ground with fire shooting up from it. I will admit it's not one of the most striking boxes most likely because it doesn't have a lot of fire erupting out of nowhere in the background, but it's OK I guess. You're just going to end up ripping it open and forgetting about it anyway. It's what's inside that counts. <br></p><p>The instructions, as usual, provide a clear step by step building process so you can get everything together in the correct way.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>As with all the new Hero Factory sets, Drilldozer comes with many new parts along with very few old ones. Old parts include his feet, head, horns, spikes, tube, drill, and launcher. But who cares when there are new parts. He comes with some pieces you can find in other Villain sets like his blade and drill arm armor, so I'll just cover parts unique to him.</p><p>He has a new body armor piece, which is only in this set. It's very bulky looking and works for his look even though it's mostly covered up. I also found out you can put the new Heroes' armor on this if you want to make a bulky Hero. The head is also quite nice and very menacing. It'd be perfect if it wasn't for Fire Lord's face on the back due to it being a flip mask. And finally there is some standard limb armor. He comes with a size 8 armor piece that runs the length of his body. This is the only set so far where you can find it. There are also armor pieces in size 4 that come in black and gray. These were also with Evo, but these are more versatile do to the colors when MoCing.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>None!<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was good. It wasn't anything too spectacular despite using the new building style. There were no special building techniques used to differentiate it from other builds. So overall, it was good.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model looks decent enough to get five stars. Let's start with the bad. He has two neck joints. While this adds more poseability, it makes him look kinda awkward. It's hard to find a position where it looks good. But this is easily fixable by removing one of the neck pieces. The drill I also have to mark down. It's oddly positioned being lower than the rest of the arm. There's also no way to spin it. Finally, his head still has the old sockets that are prone to breaking. I advise not removing it from the joint. Really, those are all the downsides.</p><p>But the figure is still good. The Meteor Launcher over the shoulder isn't as obnoxious as I thought it would be. He also has some great poseability and just looks good. I also find his rather awkward design gives him character, so I can't mark him down for that too much. And the pieces are good too and give him a nice, strong look.</p><p>I must say, though, there are some things I don't understand. He has an arm support for his drill arm. I'm not going to mark him down because of it since it doesn't hinder poseability. It just doesn't do anything. He also has two shoulder joints, which is also somewhat strang as it, too doesn't do anything either. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, he's a pretty good set. I may not recommend him over other villain sets, but I don't think you'll be disappointed if you get him. Maybe go with Jetbug on Nitroblast first, but if Drilldozer appeals to you more, get him. He's a very menacing guy and would look good in your collection.</p><p>8.5/10, decently recommended.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"KodakKid365","2011-02-08T10:48:45.107Z","Drilldozer is like, insanely awesome!","Ok, so Drilldozer looked like a really crumby &nbsp;guy. I had a wall mart gift card for 15 bucks and there was nothing else to get, so I got him. The drill thing is awesome, and so is the gun, the way it's on like a tail. He is a little short, but that can be fixed. What you do is: There are three pieces that go on his back, above his gun. These pieces are there for nearly no reason at all. Take the two red ones and use it to make him taller. You'll know how to do it once you get Drilldozer. Then put the remaining black piece in a spare parts box. If you don't have things for spare parts, then get some. They come in a lot of handy for fixing up badly done guys. I also put some extra armor I had had on his leg extension so it wouldn't look messed up. His bullet looks awesome, like an explosion.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,4,5,5,5
"Thismindofmine","2018-06-05T10:53:49.41Z","Good set.","<p>This in my opinion is the second best villain&nbsp;of the 2.0 wave. Let&#39;s start with the pros. The design of the villain&nbsp;gives him a menacing look which&nbsp;adds a feeling of danger for the heroes. The drill arm gives him a different look than the other villains in this wave. The drill and the shooter definitely&nbsp;add to the playability of this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now for the cons. The drill arm is a little limited in pose ability&nbsp;due to the hose attached to the arm. Though this can easily be fixed be taking off the hose. The other con is Drilldozers&nbsp;left arm. it feels a little weak due to the other weapons, but that&#39;s&nbsp;just my opinion.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>Great Look</p>

<p>Great Playability</p>

<p>Cons&nbsp;</p>

<p>limited pose ability&nbsp;on the drill arm</p>

<p>Left Arm is a little weak compared&nbsp;to the other weapons.</p>
