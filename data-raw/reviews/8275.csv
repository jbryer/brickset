<p>I have to disagree as my review of JetBug, aside from the name, the box art, and the energy ball.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again comparing it to the villians of wave 1 of Hero Factory, the plastic of wave 2 seems lighter, and overall appeal, when the model is built is lacking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will say the spikea are not to my liking on any of the villians in wave 2.&nbsp; In the Power Miners line, Lavatraz, the big rock monster, has spikes to simulate flame.&nbsp; I find the use of these spike parts, just not complimentary to the model, or character itself.&nbsp; Sorry, that is my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However abosilutely love Hero factory villians Wave 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would I recommend Hero Factory Wave 2 Villians?&nbsp; My suggestions is that anyone buy just one of them, build it, and then review it.</p>

"ArchOnua85","2021-11-01T01:25:56.443Z","Before The Sell-Out: Jetbug","<p>Without the context, Hero Factory could have been seen as a fine, if not lively series. A wide variety of scenery themes, colourful characters, no shortage of animations ... you know, the foundations for being out of the commercial failure. But from what I more or less understand, Hero Factory tried to be the successor of Bionicle. Obviously, in that regard, Hero Factory was an absolute failure and by 2015, Bionicle was brought back. Although the year is 2021 and no Bionicle hasn&#39;t been released since 2016, neither did Hero Factory. And from my researches, it is safe to say that Lego just gave up on constractions. So it makes me wonder, what went wrong? In order to grant the benefit of the doubt, I would have a look at my previous Hero Factory acquisitions and figure out what went wrong.</p>

<p>I wish I had a set from the Breakout series, as I genuinely believe Breakout was the pinnacle of Hero Factory, if not what it should have been in 2010. Retaining the multiple personalities, matured character roster, actual functioning weapons as well as embracing the shinier constraction&nbsp;style that got added adopted since the Ordeal Of Fire series. But I didn&#39;t, so I would have to review Jetbug instead.</p>

<p>By this point, I&#39;ll just skip assembly and even playability because it is more or less the same, if not worse than Bionicle. Aesthetic is not any better, because while the character roster started to mature and so does the functionality (but not by much), unfortunately the personality of the villains died. So the 2.0 and 3.0 are unfortunately just as bad as the 1.0. And it does not plague specifically Jetbug, it affects all sets of Hero Factory.</p>

<p>So what about the value? Unfortunately, it is certainly much pricier than it should, especially since it is nearby the price of collectable and beloved Bionicles. 1 out of 5.</p>

<p>It must be depressing to write a bad review about my favourite type of lego besides Mindstorm and say that Jetbug is not something to collect, but I think it perhaps indicates why Lego gave up on constractions. The zeitgeist that Bionicle set was tarnished by Hero Factory, and later constractions were only done for complimenting a theme&#39;s line. Unfortunately, besides of those who grew with the originals, nobody would be interested in them. It is not to say constractions should be avoided, far from it. They absolutely hold a special heart in a good portion of Lego&#39;s fans, but unfortunately, any sets from Hero Factory is not eligible for collections, Jetbug among them.</p>
