<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nitro Blast, is a litte bit better, in ""character"" in the facial part, but like the others lacking in appeal in the body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build of the hero factory villians wave 2, very easy, and they are durable despite lighter plastic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I see the spikes again in this character, and would have been better choice to use transparent orange flame, as seen in some ,medieval lego sets, harry potter, city fire, etc....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I recommend them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, buy one, build it, and see what you think.</p>
<p>The names, box art, and energy balls are the best parts of villians wave 2.</p>",TRUE,2,2,4,3,1

On to the actuall review.</p><h4>The box</h4>Nitro's box at first glance is the same as the boxes of the 2010 villains. But when you take a closer look and compare it to a 2010 one, you realize it's thinner. It's dark grey/gunmetal and on the back there's an image of Nitro battling Breez. But unless you are a box collector, you most likely don't care to much about that piece of cardboard.<br><h4>The parts</h4>All the 2011 HF sets have awesome parts, and Nitro isn't an exception. There are mostly red pieces, along with black and dark gunmetal and some yellow spikes. His helmet is double sided, having Jetbug's face on the back. On Nitroblast this looks fine, but on Jetbug I imagine it beying a major problem. The yellow spikes are rubbery, there's also a trans-orange Meltdown tank and a green Barraki eye. Two of the pieces are really long and, to my great joy, there aren't any stickers and there's print on one of the pieces. The lava sphere is also very nice.<br><h4>The build</h4>Building Nitroblast takes a good five minutes even for good builders like myself. This may be because one examines the pieces while building, but the new HF building system isn't as quick in the villains as it is in the heroes. A very enjoyable building experience.<br><h4>Playability</h4>Nitroblast is really fun to play with, whether it's just posing him or having him fight you'r heroes. However, when it comes to posing, a problem appears. That problem is the fact that his left flamethrower arm barely moves at all. Sure, it looks cool, but it can only be moved a couple of inches. <br><h4>Overall</h4>Nitro is just awesome. He has a lot of character and individuality, as opposed to the heroes. He comes with awesome pieces and has an enjoyable build, so just buy him.<br>You won't regret it.<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-19T10:16:24.87Z","LEGO HERO Factory - Nitroblast Review","This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice any easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. This figure took me about 7 minutes and 20 seconds to build. The arms, the legs, the feet, the hands and the head can be moved. On one arm is a nice looking torch and the other hand has a launcher which shoots a ball which has a great design as well. I really like the design and the colors which LEGO has chosen for Nitroblast, too. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

I don't wanna make him sound horrible, he's not, but it was a huge dissapointment. He's okay. The right arm, with the gun is cool. But the left arm, the flamethrower arm, isn't. it's very weird.",FALSE,3,4,4,4,3

<ul>
<li>Great selection of pieces 
<li>Nice use of spike pieces on armor 
<li>Good set to buy for the new joint pieces</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reinforced arm is not a good design 
<li>Too asymmetrical 
<li>Not as good as the other villian sets, who have better pieces and designs for the same price</li></ul>
<p>He's a decent set, but nothing spectacular, so it might be more worthwhile to grab one of the other villian sets.</p>",TRUE,3,5,3,3,3
