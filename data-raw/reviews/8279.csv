"paul_merton","2012-06-16T14:40:40.933Z","Looks fun, but instructions are very confusing","I'm a sucker for half price LEGO, and that's how I ended up getting this set.<br><br>I enjoyed the building experience, and I just wish that more LEGO sets came in boxes like this. You remove the thin transparent plastic covering and simply remove the lid off the box without having to break any seals or tear any cardboard. When you're done with it, the game fits back in the box and the lid goes back on fairly securely (unless you store it upside down or want to play the game in space).<br><br>However, the instructions for this game are remarkably confusing and unclear. If an adult with a 1st class degree cannot understand them properly, what hope does a child have? I know you're encouraged to experiment and come up with your own rules for the game, but it would have been nice to have something understandable to start from.<br><br>This is not the only LEGO game to suffer from poorly written instructions. It seems that LEGO's focus on quality does not extend to written material!<br>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,4
