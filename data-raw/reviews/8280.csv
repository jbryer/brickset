<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Frog Rush is primarily a board game, it&nbsp;also is a Lego set with some nice pieces.&nbsp; First of all, it comes with lots of frogs; 5 in each of the four color.&nbsp; (The yellow and brown frogs have made some appearances before, but the red frogs are brand new.)&nbsp; It also comes with a nice amount of 2x2 tiles with a single stud in the center: 12 in light bley and 9 in blue.&nbsp; Additionally, it comes with a 16x16 green plate.&nbsp; (No, not a base-plate, an actual plate.)&nbsp; And the stork is also a nice design.&nbsp; The overall layout of the board is simple and not as complex as some of the other Lego games.&nbsp; But it is also a cheaper product, and despite its simplicity it is fun to play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frog Rush isn't the most complex game out there, and the design of the game board isn't breathtaking.&nbsp; But it comes with a good bunch of nice pieces, and I know of many AFOLs who enjoyed playing it with me.&nbsp; It's a cheap and fun game to own, and if you have the chance to pick it up, I would recomend you do so.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"richselby","2013-03-19T07:35:41.457Z","Family-friendly frogs","<p>This is the first Lego game I have tried. Even though I'm an AFOL, I bought this to play with my two boys, aged 3 and 8. This time round, I wasn't looking for great modelling techniques or nice parts use. The sole criteria for this is, as a family, do we enjoy playing with it?</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box might seem over-large at first sight, but this is so you can put the assembled game inside. Which makes sense, because you wouldn't want to make the game board up every time.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Obviously, frogs. 20 of them, in 4 colours. Perfect that Amazon Basin MOC you may have at the back of your mind. But there's also a bright green 16 x 16 baseplate which is handy to have. The Lego dice is a rather unusual part for me, but pretty much standard across the game range. I can't think of alternative use for the dice though.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The build is appropriate for its target market, young children. &nbsp;It took about 15 minutes, and that wasn't rushing.</div>
<h4>The game</h4><div>It's a simplified version of Chinese Chequers, with an added wildcard element - the Stork, which can eat your opponent's frogs. My 8 year old son understood the rules very quickly. And my 3 year old enjoyed moving the frogs, and making the stork eat his brother's frogs. As with any game in my household, there was shouting, tantrums, allegations of cheating, and actual cheating. In other words, it passed the time on a wet afternoon perfectly.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A simple game with some nice parts. Given it's modest price, I can recommend this.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,5
