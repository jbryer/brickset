I understand that LEGO is trying to increase the&nbsp;appeal to girls, and I suppose it is generally a message of the winner stays in the shade and the losers get burnt... I think. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, the board is very small and so are the pieces. So simplicty is the overiding factor in design terms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of the game is to negotiate the increasing coverage of sunshades without knocking anything over. If you have big 'man hands' like me you will no doubt struggle!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we got four kids to play this game, they totally loved it. Instantly tried to start 'doing each other over' and got really competitive. The games are quick and it really didn't matter who was playing it - girls and boys loved it.</p>
