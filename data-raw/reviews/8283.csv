"CapnRex101","2011-01-07T14:58:18.427Z","2111 - Kai","<p>The NinjaGo sets were never something which I planned on picking up. However I thought I would risk giving them a try, and was actually impressed! The set is expensive, but I do like it. I like the many new parts (even if many of them are Chinese made) and despite what I had imagined, the game was actually quite entertaining!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>These spinner and character packs are not packaged in a box unlike almost all other Lego models. They come in a blister pack, with a cardboard back and a translucent plastic front. You can see everything through the plastic, the spinner, the cards and the pieces.</p><p>The instructions are just a small leaflet, like that found with the&nbsp;Collectable&nbsp;Minifigures. It shows you the character on the front, the very short building instructions (just one picture) and instructions on how to play the game.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a few nice parts in the set, but not as many as in some of the other packs. We of course have the Ninja headdress, a gold katana sword and two of the new (ish) knives, as seen in the Imperial Flagship. The torso also has some nice printing, as does the spinner.</p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><p>The figure as a whole looks great, he has the trademark ninja headdress, a sash on his torso which is fixed with a clasp (each different figure has a different clasp) and red legs. Being the ninja of fire, the entire figure is red.</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-weight: bold; "">Summary</span></p><p>Overall, I love it! I have already collected the other spinners, and think they are all excellent as well! The cards are interesting, and of quite good quality. They certainly do affect the game, and make it much more interesting. However, the price is a touch too high for my liking, so I am taking a point away, I am also knocking a point off as having got the other figures, I think that Kai is one of the weaker ones, but I would&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this (and the rest of the series)&nbsp;to anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
"handsome_skellington","2011-04-07T21:27:14.703Z","Hmmmmmm...","<p>So I got this today actually, and I played the game and stuff.&nbsp; I found that Kai seems to have a different spin.&nbsp; I also noticed that he is more attached to the spinner.&nbsp; So enough of my yadda yadda, now to the pros 'n' cons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROS:</p>
<p>-Awesome character</p>
<p>-Sweet sword</p>
<p>-Nice double-blade knife dingy</p>
<p>-Great spinner</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONS:</p>
<p>-I was disappointed with the build</p>
<p>-Not the REAL Sword of Fire</p>
<p>-PRICEY!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OVERALL:</p>
<p>Buy the starter set, then buy this!&nbsp; It is great and all!&nbsp; Can't wait to get his sister, Nya!</p>

In This Set you get a pack of playing cards to play Spinjitzu, Kai's Fire Spinner and 3 weapons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Minifigure</strong> - In this set you get the normal Kai minifigure. He has a gold fire medallion. If you are getting this set just for Kai don't bother as you can pick up Ninja Ambush for £1 less even though it contains 2 minifigures Kai and Bonzai and the&nbsp;Scythe of Quakes.</p><h4>&nbsp;</h4><p><strong>Weapons</strong>&nbsp;- In this set you get 3 weapons 1 of which is a pearl gold colour. So you get a Gold Katana,&nbsp;a Spear and a Double-Bladed Dagger. Out of all of these my favourite weapon is the Double-Bladed Dagger due to its design and its simplicity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spinner</strong> - The spinner you get in this set is a light orange coloured spinner. It also has 4 of the medallion shapes featured on Kai's Torso except these are in yellow. Behind them there is&nbsp;some&nbsp;flames. You also get 2 1x2 peices in red for the game Spinjitzu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overall</strong> - Overall this is a nice small set but way to overpriced at £7.50 so fore more the overall score will have to be...&nbsp;<strong>6/10</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Look out for more set reviews ;)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jonnyronny&nbsp;</strong></p>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,3

"123MrBrick","2013-02-02T21:26:45.553Z","Awesome. Just Awesome.","<p>Kai is one of the more impressive yet simple of the&nbsp;$10 spinner sets. </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is a standard Ninjago blister pack, with the parts and the cards displayed on the front. The back depicts Kai in battle with Bonezai, along with images of some of the other spinners available at that time. There is nothing very unique about it, considering all of the spinner packages are relatively the same. The instructions tell you how to construct Kai and his weapons, along with directions for how to enter combat with your spinner. Overall, the box and instructions are of very good quality.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set includes five battle cards, along with a golden katana sword piece, which is very common in Ninjago, a standard black spear piece, and a double-bladed sword. The spinner has very nice printing depicting Kai's elemental symbol in a nice shade of yellow. Overall, the piece selection is great, but I believe the weapons variety could have been a little better.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set includes one minifigure, the standard Kai, which is actually pretty rare considering the amount of different suits Kai has as of right now. The face is nice, because LEGO even managed to include Kai's trademark scar and a rather stern look. A very nice minifigure, great for any ninja display even if you are not into Ninjago.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Not much to say here. You build the fig, build the weapon, and snap a part on the bottom of the spinner. Still a great set, though.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed model looks great in any Ninjago display, and Kai himself looks good with the other ninja. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, this set is worth its price. I reccomend it to any new Ninjago fan who is looking for something to start out with.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Blazing_Brick","2012-04-01T13:39:35.97Z","The Most Basic Spinner Set","&nbsp; Kai is a more basic spinner,because of his weapons,cards,and element.He is one of the of the worst spinner characters,although he is a good start to anyone's collection.Kai has a double bladed dagger which is WAY too big&nbsp; to fight with,but ignoring the size,it looks cool.He has the same spear as Zane and Cole DX.He also has a golden sword with an octagonal hilt,but it is the worst weapon fo fighting you get with any of the spinners.His cards and spinner are okay,I like the detail,but the scars on Kai's face are too deeply colored,making it appear as if it is still bleeding.I do love the card,Wall Of Fire,because there is always a huge chance it or any card like it will be effective.Overall,Kai is an okay set,but without his battle cards,he is DOOMED!",FALSE,4,4,3,4,3
