<ul>
<li>Great for kids 
<li>More fun than you think to spin 
<li>Golden flag pole 
<li>Old katana (octagonal hilt)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chinese 
<li>Came with a damaged katana, it is flattend out at the top and has ridges (picture provided soon) 
<li>Ten dollars for a chinese figure and spinner!? Not worth the golden pole, should be pocket money priced 
<li>Name is more American than Japanese (which is where ninjas are from)

<p>I am done with chinese plastic, the quality and product control must be very bad over there!</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,3

The different weapons that come with this spinner can fit in to the clip on the back of the headgear.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Weapons.</b>&nbsp;First, a gold staff - OK, not a golden weapon of Spinjitzu, but still pretty cool. However, in my opinion, Cole looks better with a normal brown staff. Next, the standard black sword. This colour goes well with Cole's costume (of course). Finally, the Hammer. This piece is useful for spinning; I have hardly ever lost a match with this weapon.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Spinners.</b>&nbsp;One of my personal faves, this spinner is green with 4 grey earth symbols on it.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, a good spinner set for someone who is trying to get just a spinner, without wanting to collect.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3
"Blazing_Brick","2012-02-11T22:08:17.413Z","Watch out for Cole!","<p>Cole is the ninja of Earth,and the leader of Sensei Wu's team of ninja.Out of the eight original spinners,he was third to best.</p>
<p>Cole comes with a golden staff,which is a great weapon,but I agree with brickie 52,he looks better with a brown one.He also comes with a black katana,which goes great with his outfit,but he drops it too easily.His last weapon is a hammer,which looks ridiculous,but it's a great weapon.</p>
<p>His spinner is good at holding Cole onto it,and the color scheme looks great.Cole had decent cards,I liked most of them.Power Drain and Magnetize weren't too good,though.Cole himself had somewhat decent detail,and I liked his costume because black was my favorite color,but he is sort of the more classic ninja,which makes some people think he is nothing new at all.</p>
<p>To me,this set had a four on playability only because I had all the other spinners at the time;all sixteen of them.</p>
<p>Overall,Cole is a very decent set;I suggest you get him whether you just like Cole,or you want to collect all the spinner sets.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,4
