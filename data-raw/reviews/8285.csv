"TBOC","2011-02-28T19:59:48.043Z","Zane, the Ninja master of Ice.","<p>I went to Toysrus last Friday, to see a nice section of NinjaGo items, because Jay is not sold on his own, I bought Zane, along with a Special edition card pack I had never heard of before. I decided to review this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Packaging</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with all NinjaGo spinners, they come in a packaging meant to be placed upon a hook, instead of a larger cardboard box. My only problem with the packaging is that you almost have to ruin it to get it open. Besides that, it has a nice red and dark red color scheme, with a large shot of Kai's face on it, under a NinjaGo label. It has a nice front shot of Zane, as well as the weapons that come with him, as well as showing off his Character cards and spinner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Set</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set comes with only 19 pieces. 4 of these make up the Zane minifigure. He has leg and chest printing, as well as a white Ninja headress, which, if I'm correct, only comes in the 2006 Slave 1 set. He comes with 3 weapons: A PearlDkGrey spear, a PearlLtGrey Katana, and a pair of PearlGold Shuriken (Sp?).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The high point of the weapons, obviously, are the Shuriken of Ice. the are a new mold, and are my favorite pieces from this set. The can be held in three different places, as are a tad large in comparaison for the minifigure. They can be held separetely in each hand, of together and the staff piece supplied by the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set comes with a MdBlue spinner with white dragon printed decals. A small piece is attached to the bottom, which helps it spin. A minifigure, in this case, Zane, but any can be put on, is placed in the center. The instructions show the correct way to spin it, the function will activate when the other is hit, making the middle go up, so they can be properly knocked off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set has a lot of playability, but a lot of it only occurs when you buy another, so they can fight. However, the spinners, when correctly spun, will spin for a good 30-60 seconds, which is very good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the spinning, building and weapon trading, a card game is also played along with it. This set includes a character card for Zane, and 4 Ice type cards. As all spinners have a Character card and 4 cards, you can collect all cards by buying the spinners and starter set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Value for money</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally, I thought the idea of a minigure for $10 was outrageous. But after careful examination of the spinner, It makes ense, the spinner contains metal, which will lead to more expensive sets. However, the quailty of this set amazed me, the only way this set could be better is if the minifigure was not made in China, and was the higher quaility Denmark minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to dish out $10 for the set, buy it, ifyou're looking for a good, lower priced Ninjago set, I would go for the Spinjutzu Starter Set, as it included two spinners, an arena, and has everything you need for a game, however, each spinner includes weapons, spinners and cards exclusove to the set. Out of the 6 spinner sets, I'd say Zane is the best one. Go buy him now!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean it, now.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Okay, I have no idea about these, as I got this set piece by piece by piece from my friend.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>8/10. The shurikens are an excellent mold, the colors of the other parts are really cool, the&nbsp;Asian head is quite cool, and it includes a ninja mask, and I was really short on these. If you want the shurikens, get this set.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Not much to say, but if Zane is your favorite ninja, get this. It's the cheapest way to get him.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>What build?</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>What model?</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Well, the only good reasons to get this are Zane and the spinner. But it's rather overpriced.</p>",TRUE,4,5,2,5,1

"Blazing_Brick","2012-04-01T13:56:31.07Z","One of the Best Spinners Ever","&nbsp;&nbsp; Zane is one of the best spinners yet,and will probably continue to be,considering 2013's anatgonists will be pirates.The design on everything is amazing.He has good cards and weapons.But,the gold shurikens of ice in this set are meant to be normal shurikens,it's just that the rules require every character to have a golden weapon.He also has a silver katana with an octagonal hilt and a spear.The design on the spinner is AWESOME!It is the Ice emblem displayed on light blue,with streaks of ice and snow running around and behind it.The cards were excellent;Zane has a character card[0 Fire,300 Lightning,300 Earth,and 400 Ice],3 Ice type cards,and an Earth type card.Out of the original eight characters,Zane was the best fighter.Out of the 17 made in 2011,he was fourth to best.Overall,Zane is one of the best spinners made,including 2012,so I advise to get him!",FALSE,5,4,3,5,4
