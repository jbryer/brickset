"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-22T11:07:36.447Z","LEGO Ninjago (Spinners) - Chopov Review","I don't have so many spinner sets of the LEGO Ninjago theme. This set here is one of my first LEGO Ninjago spinners I've built which comes with a skeleton. Just like in the Nya spinner set this set doesn't have any stickers. The skeleton minifig fits in this spinner very easily as well and I think it's because that the older skeletons which we've seen before the LEGO Ninjago theme may won't fit in this piece. I haven't tried it but I don't think they'll fit in there. We also get some nice weapons and extra pieces for MOC's and brickfilms as well. I really like the new bone piece which is used in this set. What I've forgotten to tell you in my review about the Nya spinner is that these also have a stand for the cards. The only problem is that the cards fall down very easily.<br><br>What I miss on this set is a helmet for Chopov, because if you have seen the pictures of the set 2259 (Skull Motorbike) you'll notice that this figure has a helmet. Just like in the Nya spinner set we get a few cards for the game and as many LEGO Ninjago spinner sets the packagings can be messed up very easily if you are not careful when you open them. But for a set like this I can't complain much about it. It's a nice set for army building as well...<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
