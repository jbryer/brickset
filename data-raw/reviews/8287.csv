"Batmissile","2011-02-10T16:58:51.71Z","Once Bitten, Twice Bonezai","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is not much to be said about the most basic Ninjago skeleton figure, Bonezai. I covered the general problems with the skeletal army in my review of Krazi, but Bonezai has a&nbsp;major problem all his own. He is simply woefully generic. His specialty weapon is a lame gold pickaxe and the only features that differentiate him from the other minions&nbsp;are his plain white loin cloth and eyes that appear to be rolling around in their sockets. The cards he includes are good for a cheap laugh (as always) but Bonezai really brings nothing of note to the table. Get used to seeing his ugly mug, though, Bonezai appears in about half of the Ninjago sets.",FALSE,2,2,1,3,2
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-23T09:59:29.117Z","LEGO Ninjago (Spinners) - Bonezai Review","This is the third set I've got with a spinner from the LEGO Ninjago theme. Just like in the other two sets which I've reviewed yesterday this set doesn't come with stickers as well. This set is a good set for weapons and pieces which you can use for army building. We also get a few cards for the game. The cards look cool but I'm not crazy about that game. We also get another skeleton minifig with this set. This time we get Bonezai.<br><br>These skeletons from the LEGO Ninjago theme remind me a little bit of the LEGO Castle (Fantasy Era) theme. Just like in the other LEGO Ninjago spinner sets we get a stand for the cards as well. The packaging is like the one I've seen for the Nya &amp; Chopov spinner sets. It's a good set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Firox_5000","2012-01-17T17:06:58.677Z","My First Ninjago spinner","<p>This was the first Lego Ninjago spinner set which I purchased for a outstanding sale on Lego shop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set itself is very small [tiny] and the building process of the set is extremely short and takes less than 2 minutes. When complete, the set consists of&nbsp;the &nbsp;ninjago skelenton minifigure Bonezai who has a simple but effective face with red eyes and a rather neat chest concealer which is put under the head. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also three weapons included which are a bone axe, mallet and gold'ish shovel provided for game play. Aswell as this, the figure spinner is included for the use of the spinning game and there is also several game cards and a small card stand built from a few lego bricks also in the set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set contains a mixed bag of unique and cool parts such as the stick of the bone axe being made of bone, the spinner [which is rare] as well as some parts of bonzai himself. Playability with this set alone, is rather limited and not very durable with main excitement ending within 30 seconds. However the conbination of another figure [prefferably a ninja] then the duration of this set is sufficiently increased and game play of the ninjago spinner game can go on for around 10-20 minutes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For £7.50 the original rrp, this set is very overpriced and challenges the hikes of star wars sets in which a figure,spinner and a pack of cards and a few weapons does not justify that very high price tag for that size. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However for £1.87 [ the price I paid], this set is an amazing bargain and offers better value. Unfortunately since then, the set has sold out and is most certain to discontinue. A justifying price to start with would have been £5.99.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To finish this review, I would sugguest it is a fairly good spinner however with it's availiblity rather rare [ which may mean paying more than the £7.50 rrp] I would sugguest to save the money and buy one of the newer spinners as it is alot of money for it's price. But if you want the old ninjago spinners, go for it!</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,1

"SKip_E_Productions2","2011-02-18T00:24:06.203Z","DO NOT BUY THIS SET (OR ANY OF THE OTHER SKELETON SPINNERS)! ","<p>this is a terrible set! i can't believe lego is expecting people to pay $10 for a spinner that only spins for about 5 seconds before the character (in this case, bonezai) gets knocked off by a ninja. but anyway, onto the review. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>although i went on complaining about how terrible this set is, it's actually a pretty fun build. it also has some pieces i don't have, including a pickaxe, a bone (duh!), and a mace. the only reason&nbsp;we (i'm actually reviewing this for my little bro)&nbsp;got this set was because they were out of ninjas and the starter pack.&nbsp;it's quite difficult to spin with it, because if you spin too hard,&nbsp;bonezai just flies out without even battling. however i do like the cards. i can't remember all of them, all i can remember is pick and choose, gravity drop, and limbo. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>anyway, if i were you, i would just buy a set&nbsp;that has a spinner. much easier. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOT worth the money. a good build, but not worth it, so don't buy it&nbsp;unless you want it. &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,1,2,2,2,1
