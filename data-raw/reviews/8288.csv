"Batmissile","2011-02-08T11:44:52.62Z","Alas poor Yorick, I knew him Ninjago.","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I openly admit that I am probably much too big a fan of Ninjago in spite of the theme's shortcomings. The little problems with the game of Spinjitsu, and Ninjago in general, are most apparent in the single carded skeleton troops, especially Krazi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of the character is a striking and malicious&nbsp;skeletal jester.....think Yorick from Hamlet on steroids.There is a huge problem in the execution of this motif, the hat is not included with the figure! If you want the appropriately colored fool's hat you have to buy the Ice Dragon Attack set and strip that Krazi of his hat. There is also the possibility of buying the Kingdoms impulse jester for a hat, but the coloring of the two figs mesh akwardly at best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From an actual game play perspective Lord Garmadon's skeletal forces are at a steep disadvantage. The new booted bone legs look good, but they hold the characters in the spinner base much more loosely than the legit minifig legs of our ninja protagonists.For this reason they are much more easily knocked off in battle. Also,their hands dont have the 360 rotation of standard figures. As such their weapons can only be held straight out in front of them causing a major strategic disadvantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, this set is borderline useless for the game, and looks lousy and generic on display with no hat. But there is a silver lining to this cloud. It would appear that Lego has realized the lack of appeal of generic undead soldiers and done away with them in series 2 single cards in favor of more specific villains such as Garmadon and Wyplash. So buy this set if you are a completist, I can't think of any other good reason.</p>

"The_Beast","2011-07-16T21:47:41.743Z","A Bit Confused","Ninjago never seemed like a good idea in my eyes. This looked kind of neat at first so I got one. At first I enjoyed spinning it around but it gets boring after a while. The cards were a horrible idea and really seem pointless. Ten dollars is way too much for a set like this. Lego should stop trying to make playing cards because it is obviously not their forte. This theme couldn't possibly last much longer but Lego seems to be investing a lot of sets within it. There was really no building element to the set and the building element is what makes it fun. someone could get permanently depressed from looking at a pathetic &nbsp;set like this one. You make think I'm harsh on this but I will say that I like the design of the skeleton... but i probably only like because it is the only thing that is remotely good about it.",FALSE,1,1,1,3,1
