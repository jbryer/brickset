"SKip_E_Productions2","2011-03-29T21:29:58.143Z","BEST $10 SPENT!","<p>the ""2170 cole dx"" is the best $10 i have ever spent. it comes with cole dx, the scythe of quakes, a grey spear, a grey katana, five trading cards, a spinner, and five lego pieces (not three like the older ones). the spinner is gold on top and red on the bottom. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now onto the five cards: </p>
<p>cole dx: character card&nbsp;</p>
<p>smoke screen: opponent spins with eyes closed</p>
<p>weapon freeze:&nbsp;you choose one of your opponent's weapons to use in battle&nbsp;</p>
<p>boulder barricade: build a brick in front or on top&nbsp;of your minifig</p>
<p>weapon frenzy: build the two hands randomly on spinner, then attach the other two weapons on them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>
<p>worth the money </p>
<p>cool new cards give you advantage in game </p>
<p>cool spinner and minifig design</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong></p>
<p>on the box the spear is brown and the katana is silver but in reality they are both grey </p>
<p>the scythe is a disadvantage so you will lose easily </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>worth the money! but use a different gold weapon instead. buy it!</p>

"Blazing_Brick","2012-04-02T14:31:06.95Z","One of the Best!","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cole DX is a great spinner,and I have a lot to say about him,so I'll divide this review.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set has great parts,and is one of only four sets that comes with extra parts so you can attach weapons to your spinner.The weapons were great.His spear is dark grey and does excellent in battle.His katana is silver,and Cole DX looks good with it.The Scythe of Quakes is good but the blade and the piece that holds the blade to the stick come off easily.The parts were decent;I like the brown bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifig</h4>
<p>Cole DX looks great.He is black with a gold dragon running around his suit,breathing rock.He has Cole written on the back of his suit,though,so his ninja wrap isn't really hiding anything anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cards</h4>
<p>The cards included in this set were excellent,or most of them were,anyway.Smoke Screen and Weapon Freeze both could be found in other sets,so they're not exclusive to this set.Weapon Freeze is found 2172 Nya,so it is new.I like Weapon Crazy because it is a card that only Cole DX can use.Cole DX's character card has 500 Earth,200 Fire,300 Ice,and 100 Lightning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Spinner</h4>
<p>The spinner is amazing.It is red on the bottom and gold on the top.The design is the Earth Emblem with rock and earth all around.Cole DX spins well on it,and it looks great while spinning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>This set is good overall.Besides the scythe coming apart easily,I really don't have anything bad to say about it.I highly recommend it to almost anyone.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"ChickenNWaffles","2016-02-11T23:50:50.497Z","Spinners never fail!","<p>I was lucky to find this for $10 on eBay brand new and sealed considering it retired 5 years ago. I collected Ninjago back in 2011 through 2012 and I have some good memories of spinners..</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in blister packaging so once it&#39;s opened it isn&#39;t salvageable&nbsp;most of the time unless you are very careful. I keep the packaging anyway. Instructions are folded up and instructions are on&nbsp;one sheet. Most of the instructions are how to play the game and not building since there is very little building involved in the spinner sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Hmmm... First off, you get two 1x2 reddish brown bricks, one 2x2 reddish brown plate, one black 1x1 plate with vetical&nbsp;clip, and one red clip. All of these bricks are used in the game, especially the clips in this case. I&#39;ll elaborate on that later. Included also is&nbsp;a silver katana, a pearl dark grey spear, and the Scythe of Quakes. The scythe consists of three pieces all of which are in pearl gold.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One minifigure is included in this set which is Cole DX. The DX suits for the ninja are my favorite version of them so I&#39;m always excited to get a DX ninja. Cole has good detailing on his legs and torso. The front of his torso has a dragon&#39;s head on it which continues to the legs with the tail. On&nbsp;the back of his torso is his elemental symbol and under it is his name. Again, a great minifig. This is one of three ways to obtain Cole DX. Cole DX also comes in 2509 Dragon Defense and 2520 Ninjago Battle Arena.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build&nbsp;doesn&#39;t take more than a minute. You throw Cole together, the scythe together and you&#39;re&nbsp;pretty much done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>?Cards</strong></p>

<p>I added this little section so I can talk about the cards individually. First off is Cole&#39;s character card. Cole totals at&nbsp;1100 SP which includes&nbsp;500 Earth, 300 Ice, 200 Fire, and 100 Lightning. The second card is Smoke Screen! Basically your opponent spins with his/her eyes closed until the end of the spin. Not my favorite card. Third is Weapon Freeze! You choose what weapon your opponent uses so if you want their golden weapon you can tell them to use their golden weapon and hope that you win that round. Fourth card is your golden weapon card, Boulder Barrier. I can&#39;t tell where you put your one 1x2 brick but I&#39;m guessing it goes in front of your minifig. Basically it&#39;s suppose&nbsp;to protect you. Final card is Weapon Frenzy! My personal favorite from this set. This is where your clips come in. You set up on your spinner the two clips then attach weapons to them which creates an&nbsp;awesome &quot;shield&quot;, pretty much guaranteeing a win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Over all this is another fantastic spinner! The spinner looks quite nice with the pearl gold top and the red bottom. It includes great pieces and weapons too and a nice minifig.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Well worth it for $10-$15! It comes with great cards and a fantastic spinner! Cole DX and his weapons are nice too!&nbsp;This is just a great set!! I highly recommend this set.&nbsp;</p>
