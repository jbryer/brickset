"Dragon_Master_48","2012-03-20T19:13:32.997Z","A decent spinner...","<p>This spinner, although not the best, provides many good pieces/weapons for other spinners, and also goes well on its own.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Zane DX. 
<li>Red and Golden/White Spinner. 
<li>Spear works really well.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Flail and katana are sort of... simple.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This spinner is decent and holds up against other spinners. If you are looking to add to your collection, this spinner would be a good addition.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"Blazing_Brick","2012-04-02T14:43:29.31Z","The Best Fighter of the Spinners!","&nbsp;&nbsp; This set includes Zane DX,a great figure,and many other excellent elements.His Golden Flail is great;I have lost less than 5 matches with it,and I've played with it at least 300 times.His cards were great,and this set even included Chain Crazy.His other weapons include a spear[a new kind] and a black katana.His spinner design is the Ice Emblem displayed on ice with more ice floating around.His spinner is red on the bottom and gold on top.He is great overall;I highly recommend him.",FALSE,5,5,4,5,4
"digi_raptor","2021-03-08T17:34:39.98Z","Good spinner","<p>Great spinner with good cards, spinner and minifigure.</p>

<p>The only&nbsp;thing&nbsp;that I would like to be better, is the accessories as I would&#39;ve liked to see a weapon that would fit Zane more&nbsp;e.g. a weapon with shurikens as the golden weapon looks more like a Jay weapon than anything else, Cole got a scythe, so why can&#39;t Zane get a shuriken related weapon? Parts only get a 3 as it&#39;s a spinner set</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall good spinner set</p>
