"Nased","2011-04-25T03:53:21.77Z","One of the Best Spinner set","The females character in this set is ""Nya""<br>This is the only female character in the whole of Ninjago so far. I think the bad guy fortress is quite poor, therefore I will need to get this set to get hold of the female ninja. In my opinion, there are more pros than cons for this set than any other Ninjago Spinner set.<br><br>PROS<br>1) Awesome Spinner: The design of the spinner is one of the best among the current spinners. (And yes, I prefer this spinner to Zane DX and Cole DX spinners)<br><br>2) Unique Weapon: The golden dagger is only available in this set and hence I have no choice but to get it.<br><br>3) Nice Prints: The printings on the torso, legs and back of the female ninja are awesome. It's really a job well done.<br><br>4) Cards: The cards are quite useful in game play and you just need to get them to collect all the cards. The character card of Nya is available in this set. <br><br>CONS<br>1) Price: The price is really too steep for a set with so few pieces.<br><br>2) Build: As a result of the small quantity of bricks, the building experience is far inferior to other model sets of Ninjago.<br><br>In summary, I think this set is worth getting because the PROS overwhelmed the CONS. However, get it while there is a discount of 20% of more or else the price spoils the entire shopping experience of this set.<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-22T10:55:41.98Z","LEGO Ninjago (Spinners) - Nya Review","This set is the first set with a LEGO spinner from the LEGO Ninjago theme. The spinner itself is very cool and I like the markings on this piece. There're no stickers in this set which is very good. The minifigs will fit in this spinner very nice and easy and we also get some cool weapons and extra pieces which you can use for MOC's or brickfilms. We also get some cards but I'm not crazy about this game. The pictures of these cards looks cool though. The main thing why lot's of people will buy this set is probably the minifig.<br><br>The minifig - Nya - looks very cool in her outfit. She got the a printing on the back of her face as well: On the one side Nya is wearing a napkin and on the other side she looks a little bit angry. One thing I have to complain about this set is the packaging. Sometimes those packagings are really hard to open and it's really easy to mess it up if you're not careful. But for a spinner set I can't complain much.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Carnistir","2011-12-16T16:35:41.163Z","""Why should my brother have all the fun?  You're toast!"" ~Nya","<p>Nya is a good spinner.&nbsp; I actually like that there is one girl ninja, and that she has a spinner.&nbsp; Enough talk, here's the review:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nya is fairly good, for being Chinese-made.&nbsp; Her daggers are very cool, and the Staff is a nice addition.&nbsp; Her card has 400 Fire, 300 Lightning, 300 Ice, and 0 Earth.&nbsp; Her spinner&nbsp;looks like Kai's, but it is actually a lighter shade of orange.&nbsp; Her cards are:</p><p>Backdraft: 400 Fire, Build weapons onto your spinner.</p><p>Power UP: 300 Fire, Put a weapon in your character's other hand.</p><p>Weapon Freeze: 200 Ice, Opponent places a weapon of your choice in their character's hand.</p><p>Stand Tough: 100 Ice {GOLD}, Stand character on two studs of spinner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, that's all.&nbsp; I reccomend her.&nbsp; Thanks for reading!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,5,3
"Blazing_Brick","2012-03-27T16:16:41.943Z","Probably One of the top Spinners","&nbsp;&nbsp; Nya is a very good spinner because of many reasons.Her spinner set has many distinct features that you don't get in some other spinner sets.She has TWO golden daggers,that appear WAY too big in my opinion,but that just gives her more attack power because they reach farther.She also has a staff,which is one of the best weapons for actually winning;the staff is a strong and lenghty weapon.She,as all other spinner sets do,has four battle cards.They include Backdraft,Weapon Freeze,Stand Tough,and Power Up.She also has a character card;it has 400 Fire,300 Lightning,300 Ice,and 0 Earth.She is one of the best fighters of all of the spinner sets,and I highly reccomend her.But,as usual,her spinner set is highly priced;you need to be aware of that before you buy her.",FALSE,5,5,3,5,3
"Matroxide","2012-08-10T16:57:23.46Z","Good Spinner Set","<p>This is one of my favorite spinners. It has nice parts, a good minifig, and some good cards like Stand Tough and backdraft! Another positive part is the two Golden&nbsp;Nick Daggers and the Realy Big Stick included for Nya to hold. Although there is not much to build, it is great for playing against friends!</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,5
