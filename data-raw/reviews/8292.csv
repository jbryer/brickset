"freakmamma","2012-03-19T00:09:06.65Z","Get Them While You Can","I wasn't in a hurry to get the Spinner sets; at almost ten dollars each they seemed grossly overpriced.&nbsp; I have no intention on using the sets for the Spinner game but I have found a lot of people who are into it so I have been using the cards to trade for other Lego elements I want or need.&nbsp; Target and select Wal-Mart stores have dropped the price on these to about five dollars; I can only assume it is to make room for the newer sets.&nbsp; I was lucky enough to get one of almost all the 2011 released Spinners for $4.98.&nbsp; Getting the extra Nuckal mini figure and the weapons was worth it to me for the reduced price and I am hoping to find some alternative use for the spinner piece.&nbsp; If you wanted to get these but thought they were overpriced you might want to start looking in retail locations to see if the prices have dropped or if they've been moved to the clearance section.<br>",TRUE,3,3,5,3,2
"Nased","2011-04-25T03:39:47.42Z","Nothing is perfect","While this set may not be the best set to collect, the parts and cards make this set worth buying.<br><br>This minifigure is not exclusive to this set as Nuckal can be found in a few other sets. However, I like the fact that the hands of Nuckal is different from the hands of the other ""Nuckal""s in the other sets. The orientation of the hands force the minifigure to hold the weapon in a horizontal fashion so that it can be played on the spinner. The rest of the pros and cons are summarized as follow...<br><br>PROS<br>Unique Weapon: The dual side golden axe is not easily available in other sets. Hence this is the cheapest way to obtain the dual golden bone and blades of the axe.<br><br>Cards: Character card ""Nuckal"" is in this set. The remaining 4 cards are nice and it will enable collectors to get hold of all the 81 cards.<br><br>Playability: The design of the spinner is quite nice and it is worth collecting.<br><br>CONS<br>Build: The building phase of this set is close to zero and it's not fun to build this set.<br><br>Price: This is the greatest turnoff of this set. I manage to get it at SGD$15 while this set is on sales but it's still quite expensive IMHO. Perhaps SGD$12-$13 is more reasonable for a skeleton.<br><br>Overall I still didn't regret buying this set as it enhanced my Ninjago collection. My advice to all other buyers is to get this set But... get it only when there's a discount.<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,3
"Dragon_Master_48","2012-03-20T19:20:15.127Z","An Awesome Spinner; one of the best of the 2011 line. ","<p>This is the first spinner I have obtained for my collection, and a mighty start as well.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nuckal figure. 
<li>Grey and blue-ish spinner. 
<li>Bone axe and sword are ""heavy duty"" weapons. 
<li>Nuckal's extra weight (being larger than a normal figure) often helps to balance the spinner when spun properly.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Flail is a rather mediocre weapon, although the spike at the tip helps it. 
<li></li></ul>
<p>If you are extremely interested in the Ninjago spinners, or just wish to pick up a Nuckal figure, this spinner is a great value.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,4
"Blazing_Brick","2012-02-17T12:57:39.747Z",""" Fear me, for there is no stopping me!"" - Nuckal,field commander","Nuckal is a great spinner, mainly because he has great cards and weapons,not to mention the figure is very cool. I like Nuckal's facial expression because it looks like a ""you don't know what you're messing with"" look. To me, Nuckal has the best weapon arsenal there is, considering he has a double bladed bone ax,and a machete.Also, he has a chained weapon;chained weapons are the best for fighting.He has a character card and four battle cards.Power Surge is a good card in particular,because it can cancel multiple cards at once, if there is something built on the other character's spinner.Nuckal has some pieces that allow weapons to be built on your spinner,and he is the only skeleton character to have them.He is also one of only 4 characters to have these pieces.Nuckal is worth&nbsp;the money&nbsp;more than about 13 of fifteen sets other than Nuckal himself.So,in conclusion,Nuckal is almost&nbsp;worth the money,and I recommend that you buy him.",FALSE,5,5,4,5,4
