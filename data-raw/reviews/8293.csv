"LEGOParadise","2010-12-24T07:10:15.73Z","Ninja, GO!","<p>I purchased this set yesterday in my local Tesco store for £12.97 and it is better than I expected. It has some brilliant new parts and minifigures. Beacause I am one of the first people to review a Ninjago set, I will try to tell you in as much detail as possible!</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>
<p>This set includes a blue ninja (Jay)&nbsp;and the evil skeleton Frakjaw (designed to look like a japanese skeleton). A blue ninja has never appeared in the old ninja theme so it is a very unusual minifig. The ninja headpiece is the&nbsp;normal mould, the only&nbsp;speciality being the colour. The skeleton uses completely new&nbsp;elements and printing designs.&nbsp;It's head is very similar to the Castle fantasy line's skeletons, the difference being metal straps printed&nbsp;on his head. His torso is more jaggerdy than other skeletons and has a cloth design on the&nbsp;joint where the legs&nbsp;meet the&nbsp;body.&nbsp;The arms are slightly bent allowing him to make more dramatic poses. Unlike&nbsp;all skeletons Frakjaw wears shoes! They are&nbsp;connected to the legs and cannot be removed. Minifigs:&nbsp;10/10</p>
<p><strong>Weapons:</strong></p>
<p>Six weapons come with this set, three for each character. Jay's regular weapons are a&nbsp; grey&nbsp;Katana (a ninja sword)&nbsp;and a brown bamboo stick while his ""weapon of choice"" is a golden spear. Frakjaw's regular weapons are a grey sword, a white bone and ""weapon of choice"" is a golden mace. All of the weapons have already appeared in sets before except the bone, designed specialy for the Ninjago theme. Weapons: 8/10</p>
<p><strong>Spinjitzu Spinners:</strong></p>
<p>The spinners need to be spun manually in order for them to work. Every ninja in&nbsp;the Ninjago them has their own unique spinner design. Jay's spinner design is a cloud surrounded by lightning and Frakjaw's spinner shows a skull with fire around it. The spinners are made to&nbsp;hold the characters loosly in place, so that when the spinners crash into each other during battle, one&nbsp;of them flies out of their spinner. Lastly, Lego bricks can be connected to the top and bottom of the spinners. 9/10</p>
<p><strong>Spinjitzu Battle Arena:</strong></p>
<p>The arena is constructed out of Technic pieces in the shape of an oval. While it may be very bendy, it&nbsp;stops the Spinjitzu spinners from falling off you table. 8/10</p>
<p><strong>Spinjitzu Cards:</strong></p>
<p>You get 10 Spinjitzu cards in the starter pack, a fair amount, which are divided into different classes: character cards, action cards (e.g you throw or place the card into the arena for the opponent to avoid), task cards ( you have to arrange your character into a certain position, build or add some bricks onto your spinner) and golden cards (you win if you take one of your possesions away when you are holding your weapon of choice). The character cards have stands (1x2 bricks on 2x2 plates) to display them in battle. Spinjitzu Cards: 10/10</p>
<p><strong>Playability/Value:</strong></p>
<p>This set has lots of playability-once you've had enough of Spinjitzu, just take the minifigs out and play with them separately! I don't know about good value, but considering the Single Spinner sets are £7.99, I think its pretty good! Playability: 10/10, Value: 7/10</p>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>
<p>The Spinjitzu Starter Set is a good little set, offers great playability and is perfect for deciding if you want to buy more Ninjago sets. Hope you found my review helpful!</p>

"toddthuma","2011-01-14T12:04:02.637Z","Ninjago combines card game, action game, and strategy game all in one. Plus, cool Ninjas!","<p>Back a few years ago LEGO Company attempted to make the Adventures Theme something more than a theme and included a gameboard and cards in certain sets. The idea was to use the models to play a game around. I could never get anyone to play the with me though.</p>
<p>On the strength of the LEGO Games comes Ninjago, a series of Ninja characters fighting to defend, yadda, yadda, yadda. A little skeptical I decided to put my money where my skepticism was and I bought this starter set. </p>
<p>I am surprised and happy with my purchase and with this set overall. .</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is definitely something teachers and administrators will see at schools in the cafeteria and the classroom. Unfortunately, it will also be something they take away from children. Overall, the game is simple to play, involves action, strategy, and can be a lot of fun. I can see playing this with my children for a period of time before they want to change the rules or move on to something else. 
<li>
<li>The parts included in this game were a surprise. There are 10 technic axels of&nbsp;12 studs long. There is also #7 axel connectors (8) and 2 stright axel connectors. This is great for technic fans!&nbsp; 
<li>The bases that the minifigs&nbsp;stand in while competing are complex, heavy, and seem&nbsp;like they have dozen other uses. I can't wait to see how others use these in non-designed ways.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>This set is expensive compared to the number of pieces. I paid $20 USD at a big box store. When you walk the isles and compare that to other toys or options from LEGO company you scratch your head wandering why. I could have bought&nbsp;8 Toy Story Army men with two jeeps for the same price.&nbsp;The price needs to be about 1/2 of what is being charged. 
<li>You need a lot more of these to continue to make the game interesting. You need more cards which come only in other Ninjago sets. How long are two children going to be happy with two characters? Not long (person experience). Each additional set is $10 USD and that's a lot compared with 4 minifig Star Wars character packs and $3 USD collectable character sets. </li></ul>
<p>Overall, I like the game and see myself playing it. There is action and strategy that makes it fun. The outcome shouldn't favor one player continually which will make it a challenge and keep the interest of several invovled. The price causes me to pause and rethink my decision. As collectable ninjas go, this is an expensive way to obtain them.</p>

"gnat2u","2011-03-12T08:11:53.09Z","Good for battles","<p>Awesome set. it has the two most awesome people in the world and the arena is cool if you can make it bigger. Ninjago!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"TopperTwist","2011-01-17T19:34:46.37Z","Surprisingly Good!","<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;I bought this set with my hard earned $20. A little skeptical due to the price-per-peice ratio, I bout it anyways due to how much I liked the Ice Dragon Attack and Skull Motorbike. Review in short: Everthing you need to start your NinjaGo game collection.</p>
<h4>Minifigures:</h4>
<p>Two minifigures, twenty bucks, not bad. Jay is pretty common so we unfortunately get him, but he's still a great figure. Frakjaw is good to get, but we don't get his headpeice which is very disappointing, but I guess during battle it would fall off easy. The bad thing about the minifigures is that it's the cheapest plastic ever. Oh well, I guess I'll buy the actual NinjaGo building sets with the real figures, and use the cheapies for battle.</p>
<h4>Arena, Cards, and Accessories:</h4>
<p>You get six accessories with this set. Since it's a wide variety with two golden weapons, it's not bad. The cards are good and adds a great twist to the game. With four per player, it's really nice. The arena is a Technic fans' dream. Aside from that, it's not much of an arena, but it serves the useful purpose of ensure that your figures will stay on the table.</p>
<h4>The Game:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The game is simple to play, but yet kinda fun. Even though it's clearly geared for kids around the age of 9 or 10, I as a TFOL still enjoyed playing it. The spinners are a nice new peice, and the rules of the game are very easy to grasp and play. Also, I found no problems with the rules of the game.</p>
<h4>""The Good""</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Almost everything in this set are good. The accessories, card stand, trading cards, arena, rules, playability, and completely new idea for Lego. Very good, Lego, very good.</p>
<h4>""The Bad""</h4>
<p>&nbsp;However the ""Good"" of this set are great, I can't go without mentioning what's not good about this set. First and foremost, the sheer cheapness of plastic, not including Frakjaw's hat, poor price-per-peice value, and kiddish essence of this set bring it down a smidge.</p>
<h4>Closing:</h4>
<p>This is an awesome set, and I came to the realization that even though it's only 57 peices, the arena is nice and sizeable, the game is fun, and the set is nice for $20. It's be more fun with more characters and spinners, but for $10 a pop I'll wait until I have more cash. All in all, if your interested in actually ""playing"" NinjaGo Spinjitzu, then this will surely get you started and on your merry way. All that's left to do is pick up the battle arena for $50 -_-.</p>

"ryanaitch","2011-01-21T15:18:52.987Z","Fun, some nice parts, but too few for the 20 USD price tag","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Packaging is mostly clear plastic with a hard backing, meaning that you can see nearly all the parts (with the exception of the 20 Technic parts, I think). No surprises here. Instructions are clear enough on how to play the game, which is really very simple.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>At 20 USD, this set's parts are about 37 cents each, almost four times the &quot;ideal&quot; ratio. Granted, the one-piece spinners are fairly complex/large, and there are two minifigures, but that's still a silly price for little more than a minifig pack.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>New parts (color): Ninja headwrap in blue, flail in pearl gold, spear in pearl gold, new printings on heads/torsos<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>New parts (mold): Skeleton torso, skeleton arms, skeleton legs (boots!), long bone, spinner bases<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This is where this set (and all the spinjitsu single-fig packs) shines. We get the first blue ninja Lego's ever produced, but the skeleton is my favorite. While this may not matter to most people (who may not have even noticed), the arms on the skeletons in the spinner sets are different than those on the regular Ninjago skellies -- the lower hands are rotated 90&deg;, which is much more useful for what I build.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Very, very short -- assemble the two minifigs, stick a couple basic bricks together, and assemble the Technic frame. It's over in a couple minutes. Really makes you realize how little you're getting for your money here.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Lots of loose parts; I wouldn't call it a &quot;model&quot; so much as separate game pieces. The game is simple: you shout &quot;NINJAGO!&quot;, spin your character w/ weapon, and watch to see whose figure falls off first. If you lose, your opponent gains your weapon (start the game with 3 each). You can play cards throughout the game, some of which depend on which weapon your figure holds. These cards tell you to do anything from stand your character on one leg to throw the card at your opponent's figure (card sleeves are a must, I think). The frame makes a nice field (no more spinning off the table and across the room!), but it's really nothing noteworthy regarding techniques or parts.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>A very small set for the price, but for someone like me the new parallel skeleton arms are a must. I got lucky and found it complete for 5 USD at Goodwill (Yay!), but even the ability to play the game is probably not worth the full price.<br />

This set is nice because it includes an ""arena"", all though occasionally the spinners do spin outside of this area.

"GDG16","2011-09-03T20:43:10.8Z","Overpriced!","<h4>I had some extra money from christmas</h4>
<p>so I got this little set, mainly for the minifigures. What I didn't know is that they are made of Chinese plastic, which you can easily see on Jay.</p>
<p>Minifigures: Jay- 1 of the 4 ninjas (6 if you include nya and sensai wu), Jay is my second favorite. he gets a&nbsp;Silver Katana, a&nbsp;wooden brown&nbsp;staff, and his special spinner Golden spear. I like Jay because of the blue Ninja get up. But, compared to my other Ninjas, you can actualy SEE the difference in plastic on the hood. Also, the torso printing is sloppy but still, its a collection builder.</p>
<p>Frakjaw- 1 of the 4 ""regular"" skeletons. he comes armed with a long white bone, a silver troll sword, and his special spinner Golden Flail. He is my second favorite Skeleton and has nice armor and a printed red belt. He has the new skeleton shoes and the spinner arms.</p>

<p>-Frakjaw</p>
<p>-6 weapons</p>
<p>-Nice Technic peices to make the ring</p>

<p>-VERY overpriced</p>
<p>-Chinese Plastic</p>
<p>-Not fun with one person</p>

"Blazing_Brick","2012-04-01T14:26:41.533Z","Better Value for Your Money","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally,I do reviews in one quick paragraph,but because this set has a lot more than normal spinners,I'll divide it up.</p>
<h4>Jay</h4>
<p>Jay is the un-before seen ninja,and his element being lightning,he is probably the most popular ninja.But,in this set,his detail is poor.On the spinner,it's okay,but...let's just say if he came alone,buyers would be more disappointed.Jay,you owe Frakjaw one there.His cards are great,as he includes Foce Field AND Trade Off.His minifig,however,is where the detail starts getting poor.His weapons are a silver katana,a golden spear,and the only good one:his staff.His spinner's design&nbsp;is a very angry-looking cloud surrounded by lightning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Frakjaw</h4>
<p>Frakjaw has very short legs but is just as tall as all of the ninja.Who knows why?I don't.But,in spite of his dwarf-like legs,he appeals to me more than Jay does.His cards are handy and just as good as Jay's.His weapons are a long bone club,a machete[or at least that's what it's supposed to be],and a golden mace ball.All of his weapons are good.But,there's one thing wrong:he doesn't have his hat!None of the skeletons except Wyplash do.[Kruncha's is part of his head mold]So I had my cousin give me one,and I must say,he looks a whole lot better.</p>

"Mr__Thrawn","2020-06-20T02:55:21.09Z","Fun game, not great as an actual set","<p>The 2257 Spinjitzu Starter Set was one of the original LEGO Ninjago releases from 2011. The original retail price was $20, and it included 57 parts and two minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>As was&nbsp;typical for the spinner packs, the set comes packaged in a plastic blister package with a cardboard backing. The spinners and character cards are displayed nicely within the blister, and the the other parts are packaged in a small polybag inside. There aren&#39;t any building instructions, but instead a folded leaflet with gameplay rules and an ad for the other sets from the first wave of Ninjago.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The set includes 2 minifigures- Jay and Frakjaw. Both are unfortunately made of slightly cheap Chinese plastic. Jay, the blue ninja of Lightning, appears here in his iconic original gi. It&#39;s simply designed, and is entirely blue except for the brown harness and gold elemental emblem on his chest. Frakjaw is one of four standard skeleton figures released in the original 2011 wave. He wears red spiked armor, and has an interesting head print with metal plating printed on.</p>

<p><b>Model and Accessories</b></p>

<p>There&#39;s not too much to build here, just a Technic frame and some weapons. The assortment of accessories is nice, including two of the golden weapons, which were instrumental to the story and required to play certain cards in the game.</p>

<p><strong>Play</strong></p>

<p>This set is designed exclusively for play, and succeeds in that respect. The spinners are excellently designed, with attractive printing and an interesting and effective function to eject the figure when they&#39;re knocked askew. The arena is also effective for helping keep the spinners in place, and it&#39;s great to get two figures to do battle. The collectible spinners and weapons also add some engagement. Of course, the cards are integral to the play experience. They&#39;re all very simple to put into play, using the bricks and accessories included in the spinner packs. The cards, particularly the character cards and the gold foil cards included in some of the limited edition sets, are also attractively designed and collectible.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is an excellent set for play, particularly in conjunction with other characters and spinners. The parts count is poor for the price, but the mode itself is well sized and there&#39;s tons of play value. The set can often be found new and sealed on BrickLink or eBay for close to the original retail price. If you have nostalgia for the original Ninjago line, or if you want a taste of the classic spinner game (which has yet to be matched in terms of customizability and general play value, in my opinion), then I definitely recommend this set.</p>
