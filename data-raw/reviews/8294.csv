"Frenzied_fox","2011-02-09T08:17:31.43Z","First Class Starter Set","<p>Ninja Ambush: The Review!</p><p><br></p><p>This set is an excellent purchase if you really want/need ninjas in your collection, which I did.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>Pretty basic, some different pictures of the set in action, and of course the easy to follow instructions. &nbsp;</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>This set has one nice part I didn't have before, the nunchuck/scythe golden piece, which is pretty awesome.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>There is the red Ninja, (of course), which has the red Legs, torso, and hood, and some cool insigna on the torso. The ninja's face is also cool, as he has a scar running along his left eye that gives him a hardened and determined look.</div><div>Before I bought the set, the skeletons looked so blocky, but that was just because of their feet. The rest is similar to the old skeleton, save the arms look more minifigure like, and the have a slicht backbone sticking out in the back.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>Pretty simple build, its just a catapult but when you push down, bamboo flys out of the way, revealing &nbsp;a scary ninja jumping out at skeletons. The scythe is three parts, and its pedestal is very simple.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This model is pretty fun to play with, launching ninjas and skeletons and other minifigures. What I find odd about this set though, is why the ninja is jumping the unsuspecting skeleton for no reason. If I saw a golden scythe in the middle of the forest I might walkover and pick it up. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Good set to pick up if &nbsp;you want to start a ninja collection, I would recomend getting this with another small ninjago set, like Ninja Training Outpost, for more fun, but it can stand alone. Definetly worth picking up to add to your collection. &nbsp;BTW I'm just starting out with reviews, so if you would, please say if it was helpful or not. Thanks!</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"TopperTwist","2011-01-23T20:33:23.987Z","Great Set, Perfect Price!","<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This is a nice set, with a perfect price. I would reccommend this to anyone starting out with NinjaGo. Review in short: Start (or continue) your NinjaGo collection with this outstand set, you won't regret the $7 you spent.</p>
<h4>Minifigures:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The minifigures in this set are pretty good. Kai is nice, with his flaming red Gi, and the scar on his face. The only problem with him is that you get the same boring katana piece I'm starting to become fet up with. Bonezai is nice, though. He includes the new skeleton body, arms, head, and legs, but that's about it. He really needs chest armour and a hat of some sort. He does include the new big bone piece with ax, however, improving the figure.</p>
<h4>Accessories:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This set includes a little stand with the Golden Scythe. It's great that you get a golden weapon in this set. The stand for it is bland, but an easy way to get a 2x2 with stud in the middle plate. Nice enough accessories.</p>
<h4>The Set:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;This set is nice, it even has a little play feature. On the bamboo-designed stand, you push the odd RED lever and pop goes Kai. It's a very simple mechanism, but it does include a couple nice Technic pieces. The only thing is, it would make more sense if Bonezai were jumping out, not Kai. Whatever though, it doesn't matter.</p>
<h4>""The Good""</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The unforgetably great things about this set are Bonezai's weapon, Golden Scythe, play feature, and the best: the price!</p>
<h4>""The Bad""</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The figures in this set are lacking, along with an incredibly easy build (what can you expect from a $20 set, though). Other than that this set is great!</p>
<h4>Closing:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The $7 you spend on this set are well worth it for what you get. It's perfect for little kids, but a TFOL like me enjoys it, as I'm sure some AFOLs would too. The price-per-piece value is awesome, and the set stands strong.&nbsp; Go and add this to your NinjaGo collection, it belongs.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: Everyone loves ninjas, and this set is an easy way to acquire one. The red ninja known as 'Kai' is a great minifigure, and a great addition to any collection.<br></li><li><br></li><li>Pro 2: The pieces in this set are great, and very useful. I personally enjoyed the gold scythe, as well as all the brown pieces, which are great for landscaping. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: If you ask me, I think the antagonists in this theme are kind of dorky. The skeletons' overall looks seem a little cheesy, and I think the LEGO Company should expand their villains to more than unintelligent skeletons. <br></li><li><br></li><li>Con 2: Well, there isn't really another, I think. However, I think it would be awesome if LEGO would make a Ninjago Battlepack. I'm not a fan of rainbow-colored ninjas, but having a few classic, black ninjas would be fantastic.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this a great, small set, and well worth your hard-earned greenbacks. I have been waiting years for the re-release of the Ninja theme, and I am officially satisfied.

"diehardlegofan","2011-02-20T12:22:21.383Z","Impressive Set","I was really excited about this NinjaGo theme, but when I saw that the ninjas were against skeletons and that their martial arts was called ""Spinjitzu"", it turned me away from the theme. &nbsp;I was definitely hesitant to buy this set, and the only reason I bought was because it was Saturday and I was REALLY bored. &nbsp;But now that I have this set I realize I really don't like it because it's totally awesome and epic or whatever; I like it because it reminds me of when LEGO seemed totally awesome to me. &nbsp;I am older than the recommended ages for this set, so I'll try to be reviewing it as if I was younger. &nbsp;<br><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>I'll start with the mini-figures: in this set you get Kai (the ninja) and Bonezai (the skeleton) and I must admit they are pretty cool; they have marvelous detail (something you can't really appreciate unless you actually have the set), the faces are BURSTING with character, and the weapons are neat (this set includes the golden&nbsp;scythe). &nbsp;I think it's cute how LEGO put a ""bone ax"" in this set for the skeleton. &nbsp;Now Bonezai is a neat little guy, although, not my favorite skeleton. &nbsp;Some people complain about his feet, and even though the feet are necessary for him to be on the spinjitzu spinners, I would have liked the normal feet better. &nbsp;I would be complaining about his head because it doesn't really make him look hardcore evil, but I guess if he did look hardcore evil, this set wouldn't be for 6-12. &nbsp;<br><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Although my favorite ninja is Cole, Kai is still a pretty cool ninja. &nbsp;Now I won't get into massive detail about the mini-figure, otherwise no one will want to read this review. &nbsp;To sum up all my likes about this mini-figure: the color is good, the detail is great, the face is good, the cowl is good, and the catana is great. &nbsp;<br><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Now on to the main set. &nbsp;There are two sections to the set. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I am not sure what to call either of them. &nbsp;One of them seems to be a wooden wall, and the other looks like a pile of rocks holding the golden scythe. &nbsp;Anyway, there's not much to say about the pile of rocks so I'll just get on to the main section. &nbsp;The playability feature of this set (if you didn't know already), is that you put the ninja on the back, then you push the red lever and the walls separate and the ninja launches out. &nbsp;Now, I'm not sure if I built wrong or something, but when after the walls separate they don't come back together, and I think it would have been better if they came back together. &nbsp;But other then that, this set is good. &nbsp;This was my first NinjaGo set and I will probably be buying more. &nbsp;Even though I probably would have liked the Ninja Outpost a little better, I recommend this set to anyone who is just starting on this NinjaGo set.",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"qitah","2011-02-14T02:33:39.66Z","Enter the Ninja!","This is a great little set and a good place to start with the Ninjago theme. You get two protagonists, both of whom have awesome weapons, a third awesome weapon to fight over and a brutal play feature to boot. So, to break it down further:<br><br>The Minifigs:<br><br>First up is Kai in his red ninja pyjamas. He has a fantastic wraparound hood that has a clip at the back to hold an extra weapon. His torso print is of a kind of rope harness connected with a gold badge over a standard gi, very pretty. He has leg printing too, a dark red sash with ends that trail down his thighs. His face is set in a grim scowl and he has a scar running across his eye. As someone mentioned earlier, this is a new face print, and i'm liking it a lot!<br><br>Second up is Bonezai, or skellie 2.0, as i call him. Lots to like here too - a great detailed torso and hilarious crazy eyes. The torso is a change from previous skellies - the hip bones are more pronounced and there is a spinal ridge at the back, whereas the old skellies front and back were the same. Skellie 2.0 also has new arms that are bent at a 45 degree angle, which makes them more similar to minifig arms. Unfortunately you still can't rotate the wrists, so you are restricted in how you can pose anything they are carrying. Ah well. Skellie 2.0 also has new ""legs"", or rather, concrete boots. This is the only thing i dislike about this figure, I mean c'mon - you have this brilliant torso and realistic arm angles and then you give him black blocks for feet?? I guess it's so the skeletons can cope with the spinning top game part of Ninjago, but i can live without it. I replaced the concrete boots with the old skeleton feet first chance i got.<br><br>The accessories:<br><br>The accessories in this set are pretty sweet. Kai has a standard silver katana, but skellie 2.0 has a brilliant bone axe, which is made up of a long bone piece (nearly as long as the katana) with a black/silver-speckled axe head attached to it. The ""prize"" weapon is a long handled gold kama (sickle shaped weapon), which is made up of three pieces. The connecting piece of this weapon appears to be a new piece as well, a kind of T-shaped lightsabre handle?<br><br>Build and Play Feature: <br><br>Nothing special in the build, it'll only take you 5 minutes, tops. There's a bit of technic involved but nothing too heavy. There's a little stand for the gold kama and a catapault cleverly disguised as a bamboo grove. You place Kai (or skellie 2.0) on the end of the catapault and press on the red plate at the other end - this makes the two halves of the bamboo grove spring apart and flings the minifig across the floor with surprising force. Great fun for all the family and heaps more satisfying than the spinners! <br><br>Overall conclusions:<br><br>For the number of minifigs, number of new pieces and prints, and minifig flinging play feature, this is great value. I bought it for $8.50 AUD, and prob will buy another one or two if i can get them discounted. If you not convinced by Ninjago, this is certainly the place to start. Just replace those horrid skellie 2.0 legs - trust me on that. <br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A very fun, if quick, build.&nbsp; Putting the little bamboo grove together was particularly satisfying because I could really see the bamboo shoots coming together as I built.&nbsp; I may look for more of the pieces used and build some bamboo groves of my own. <br></li><li>Launching the ninja Minifig at the skeleton Minifig never fails to make me smile, particularly when the ninja knocks the skeleton over.&nbsp; If that's not playability I don't know what is.</li><li>With two Minifigs and the super cool camouflaged ninja launcher, the $7 price point is awesome.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I don't really care for the feet on the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ninjago</span> skeletons.&nbsp; I haven't picked up any sets with the little spinner bases, but it looks like the feet are probably necessary for the spinners to hold onto the skeletons, but I think they just look silly.&nbsp; That, of course, isn't really a problem with this set so much as it's a problem across the theme.</li><li>I would have preferred if the piece that sticks out in front of the bamboo grove weren't bright red.&nbsp; Brown or even black would have looked much better and been less disruptive to the illusion that the skeleton is walking past an ordinary bamboo grove and has no reason to believe that a ninja is about to come flying at him.<br></li></ul>

"brickboyg","2011-02-11T07:19:56.947Z","Detailed review of Ninja Ambush 2258","Figures:<br><br>Kai: A brilliant ninja figure; a red ninja with black ribbons and a gold face on torso and legs. Little creases all over the torso. Black hands look great on the stunning red body. He also has a holder for his brilliant dark sword. Sword colour is much better than the light silver or gold coloured versions of the sword. The sword is a long sword, very good for playing with. Also underneath his mask is a yellow face with an angry expression, with red scars on his cheeks under his eyes. I believe this face is a new face as well. A 5/5 figure, excellent!!<br><br>Bonezai: Another 5/5 figure. Skeleton body is great, and has cool small black circles at the top of the torso. His rib cage is excellent, compared to previous skeletons. His legs and black feet are also excellent. Because of his thick feet, he is pretty easy to stand up on non - LEGO objects. Arms are also very much improved from other skeletons, and do not have viewable hinges or raised pieces of arm. The arms are bent good for holding guns to a shooting angle, or holding his brilliant axe up. I believe that most of the figure is made of new accessories and parts. I love the bone axe - a one bladed axe with a handle made of a long skeleton bone - but it is rather unusual.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>1. 5/5 figures.<br><br>2. Brown colour on most objects in this set are cool (My little brother and me both like the brown bricks, because LEGO didn't use to make it much 10 - 15 years ago, and a large quantity of our LEGO is old).<br><br>3. Ninja Ambush catapult system is pro-class; press the red brick at the front and two bamboo trunks fold outwards and Kai comes catapulting out in ninja fashion - and if Bonezai is in line with the bamboo trunks - hitting Bonezai over ready for a battle.<br><br>4. The Golden Scythe is beautiful. It is in three parts, a golden stick, an unnameable golden bespoke piece, and a golden blade. It is stuck into a shiny flat brick with a hole in the centre, which is built on top of some leaf bricks and two sloped pieces.<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

The fire ninja, known as Kai, has the ninja mold returning after a long time, as well as a katana, but also has a brand new torso and face. The torso features the Ninja clothing with a fire badge on the shirt. No back printing, however. The face is pretty sweet as well- a gruff and serious look with a scar across the eye. That's some cool LEGO right there. The skeleton known as Bonezai features an axe, brand new feet, and a new body mold. That's pretty sweet.</p><p>The build is simple and fast. Firstly, you build the shrine containing the Scythe of Quakes. It's a simple build, but it works. The Scythe is a three piece build and it stays together quite firmly. After the shrine, you build the bamboo launcher. The bamboo is represented using brown cylinders and grass pieces, but it gets the job done better than anyway I could've thought of.

The next and final figure is Bonezai, who is a very standard figure. He doesn't feature his chest pad like other skeletons have, and has a standard Ninjago skeleton body and legs. His face is all whacked out and confused, like he got hit on the head. Overall, the minifigure selection is decent, but not too exciting. <br><br>The set is very standard, starting with the stand. The golden scythe is put in the center, and that wraps it up!&nbsp; The bamboo is the main portion of the set. I really don't like the tan pieces though, and I would really like it if those were in brown. The bamboo looks decent enough, but the main goal is to launch Kai out to attack Bonezai. By pressing a red button on the front of the bamboo stalk, the catapult pushes up, the bamboo splits in two, and Kai launches out to attack Bonezai! I could honestly play with that feature for an entire afternoon. It's really fun! <br><br>This set is very good for two reasons- value and the play feature. It's right below 10 cents per piece, so the value is great, and the pieces are good for what you get. Overall, the set is very good. The downfall is the golden scythe, as it is an overly common weapon, and to me, it would make more sense to put in Kai's golden dragon sword since it is his golden weapon. In addition, I don't like how the tan pieces stick out on the bamboo. Overall, I recommend getting it because for only 7 bucks, you can have loads of fun. Overall, this set deserves a 4 out of 5!

"vikings","2016-07-04T03:11:04.683Z","Good small set ","<p>This is a good little set for a cheap price ($7.00). I got this not to long after it was released. It is&nbsp;a good little&nbsp;set. With it you get the stand for the scythe of quakes. Also you get Kai and Bonezai&nbsp;with it each with ok weapons. Then the main structure of the set is an ambush item used by ninja Kai. For this structure it is very good for the price at it&#39;s time. The red brick is used to catapult&nbsp;Kai forward pushing the trees apart and launching Kai onto Bonezai attacking/tackling&nbsp;the&nbsp;o skeleton.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Box/Instructions:</h2>

<p>The box is a box with good detail and shows a lot about this little set. The instructions are just your average size instructions for a $7.00 set. The dimensions for the box are 14.1 x 12.2 x 4.6 cm and the set weighs 0.08 Kg ( 0.18 lb )&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts:</h2>

<p>The parts for it&#39;s time were good. The ninja sword and a few other pieces were new or unique. The total piece count was 71 total pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures:</h2>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;you get in this set are Kai the ninja of fire and the skeleton Bonezai. Kai comes with a sliver ninja sword and Bonezai with a large bone with a dark grey shiny axe blade. Both minifigures are good.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The build:</h2>

<p>For a small set like this the build is good. No challenge at all unless you are just a beginner. The build took me around 2-5 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The completed model:</h2>

<p>Once finished the set was good. The minifigures fit the set well as you get Kai in a really cheap set for the start of this new series. Great structures that are have good playable features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall opinion:</h2>

<p>Very good set for as small and cheap as it was. This is a good set for a new or young&nbsp;Lego builder or&nbsp;if you are just getting into the Ninjago&nbsp;series. Good for all who want it even if it is out of your building league. Overall I give this set a 4 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Wreckagestudios","2017-08-20T18:03:41.207Z","Ninja Ambush-Good set","<p>Ninja Ambush is a good set. It has a reasonable price, good minifigures and it is a cheap way to get The Scythe of Quakes. The play feature allows Kai to fly through the air and attack Bonezai. When you press on the red brick sticking out, the trees will slide away and any minifigure you have placed will be shot forwards. Kai has a plain red ninja mask (same as the old themes) and a silver Katana. He has a dark red belt printed on his hips and legs and sashes across his torso with a golden fire badge. Bonezai has a skeleton torso with a white belt. He wears black boots which are attatched to clips; this is used for his legs. Bonezai has a small smile and crossed red eyes. His weapon is made of a large white bone and a metal-looking axe blade. Overall, I think this is a good set.</p>

"Mask_of_Control","2020-05-16T13:31:41.59Z","The best option to start a Ninjago collection!","<p>When the first wave of Ninjago sets released I bought this one because I really liked the story of the show. The set is small but it contains good accessories, minifigures and a suprising play feature.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>&raquo; Incredible design.</p>

<p>&raquo; Good variety of accessories.</p>

<p>&raquo; The green leaves add a good detail to the scenario.</p>

<p>&raquo; Contains two good minifigs.</p>

<p>&raquo; Includes a play feature that allows you to launch Kai to the air.</p>

<p>&raquo; The play feature works perfectly.</p>

<p>&raquo; The play value is decent even with only this set.</p>

<p>&raquo; Bonezai has&nbsp;good design and detail and at the time he had&nbsp;a new type of body for a skeleton.</p>

<p>&raquo; At last but not least, the set includes the Scythe of Quakes that is one of&nbsp;the four Golden Weapons.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p>&raquo; Bonezai does not come with a skeleton armor.</p>

<p>&raquo; If the set comes with Kai, it will make more sense to include the Sword of Fire and not the Scythe of Quakes.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>The set comes with great design and play features for a small sets and does not have many flaws.</p>

<p>I would recommend for fans of Ninjago to buy this set and for people that want to start collecting Ninjago to buy it too.</p>

"Andy317","2018-06-04T16:17:51.087Z","Good Value for a Small Set","<p>For a $10 Set, you get pretty good value for what you pay for. You get a hero and villain Minifigure as well as a half-decent build that includes some jungle pieces that could be used for a MOC if desired. The play function is cool but simple, so overall it&rsquo;s pretty much a must by for the kiddies, because it&rsquo;s cheap, action packed, and valuable. However, I wouldn&rsquo;t pay more than $15 for this secondhand on EBay or whatever.&nbsp;</p>

"SpaceNinjaWarrior","2022-10-20T12:27:38.967Z","A cute little playset that's a perfect start to your Ninjago journey!","<p>Hi there, this is my review of set 2258 Ninja Ambush. Let&#39;s start with...</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>The set comes with 2 minifigures, a Ninja&nbsp;and a skeleton.</p>

<p>Kai, the red ninja, master of fire, is dressed in his classic trainee gi. He has black gloves, a dark red belt, and a golden emblem on his torso. He has the classic ninja mask from 1989 in red, and wields a silver katana which can be attached to a clip on the back of his mask. Unfortunately, he has no back printing, but it&#39;s a minifigure from 2011, so it&#39;s not a big deal. He also cannot move his head because of his mask.</p>

<p>The villain of the set is Bonezai, a skeleton. He has a white belt printed on his torso, which is a specialised skeleton body. His legs are specialised, so they can be used on the Ninjago Spinner game from 2011/2012. His face has a &quot;dizzy&quot; expression, very funny. He wields a bone-axe (a long bone with an axe piece connected to it). He has no armour, which he does have in the show, so that&#39;s a bit disappointing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for the minifigures, now onto...</p>

<h2>The side build</h2>

<p>The side build is a small rock-like shrine for the Scythe Of Quakes. It&#39;s made out of 9 pieces (3 of those are for the Scythe) and overall, it&#39;s quite simple but effective. However, the Scythe is put on top of a 2x2 jumper plate, and can be easily knocked off of the shrine because of that. Instead of putting the Scythe Of Quakes in this set, it should&#39;ve been the Sword Of Fire, which actually belongs to Kai.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for the side build, now let&#39;s start with...</p>

<h2>The main build</h2>

<p>The main attraction for this set is... some bamboo? Well, not really. You might notice a red piece at the front sticking out, well that&#39;s for a reason. Behind the not-suspicious-at-all bamboo, there&#39;s a little space to put Kai on it. Now when you push on the red piece with a little force, Kai will jump through the bamboo, ready to strike! Now you know why the set it called &quot;Ninja Ambush&quot;, it&#39;s actually an ambush!</p>

<p>Now, the actual build... It looks a little odd, because of those 3 2x2 tiles in tan colour. You can also see the 2 black technic pieces sticking out a bit, I wish they put something there to cover those up instead of those 2x2 tiles, but you could easily do that yourself!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>My first ever Ninjago set from 2011, I&#39;m quite happy with it! Picked this up for 5 bucks without the box, and had a blast building it (and maaaybe playing with it)!</p>

<p>Overall, I think this set is a great start for new Ninjago fans. It may have its small flaws, but the price is also not bad, and some pieces are great for MOCs, such as the golden pieces from&nbsp;the Scythe Of Quakes, or the bamboo pieces. If you buy this used, I&#39;d recommend you buy it for 7 or 8 bucks, if it comes with the box and instructions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my first review on this platform, hope it helps! And thanks for reading!</p>
