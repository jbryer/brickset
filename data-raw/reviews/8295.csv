"TopperTwist","2011-01-10T00:38:53.22Z","GREAT Set","<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;I love this set. It has great play value and is perfectly priced. I know, all TFOLs, and AFOLs are slightly intimidated to buy NinjaGo because of it's little-kidness. Not to worry, these sets are a LOT better than I hoped for.</p>
<h4>Building the Set:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Very easy build, surprisingly better color differentiation, and short. I think the build went smoothly, but of course, its a little set meant for little kids, so the build was extremely easy.</p>
<h4>Minifigures:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Surprisingly, the two minifigures of this set are great! It's good to see Denmark plastic on Ninjas again! Jay, the lightning ninja has the same mask, and a great single-printed torso and printed legs. The blue on him wasn't as ultra-violet as I thought either. And Chopov is great with his new giant bone-ax thing. He has an old helmet with new armour, and a whole new printed skeleton body! Good surprise Lego, the figures are amazing!</p>
<h4>The Set:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The motorcycle has a little feature where you pull a lever and the front skull design swings down like a hammer. Nice feature, at least it works. Plus it adds to the play value. It's designed nicely with a great color scheme. It also has suspention, but I think that was an accidental feature due to using long axles. Bonus, this set was much bigger than I expected.</p>
<h4>The Good:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;I have nothing good to say about this set, except EVERYTHING. Go get it, It's only $15 and well worth the price from set value to peice value alike.</p>
<h4>The Bad:</h4>
<p>Uh? Nothing, this is a good small set.</p>
<h4>Closing:</h4>
<p>With&nbsp;a perfect price-per-peice ratio, this set is better than most of the other NinjaGo sets. For a low price of $15, I would definetaly pick up this set if you have 15 bucks in your pocket. I'm very happy I chose NinjaGo over the StarWars battlepacks. </p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2011-03-31T02:34:11.56Z","Not An Easy One to Judge...","<p>I must confess that I sort of find the premise of LEGO's new Ninjago line rather stupid. The idea of a mystical and mechanized ""Skeleton Army,"" charged by some form of dark magic from the Underworld (almost resembling some kind of a clan or gang rather than an ""army"") is totally fine by me, in fact it's a brilliant idea IMO, and it has produced some incredible Minifigures and vehicles. The return of Ninjas into LEGO's contemporary themes is pleasing to see (I must say though these new ones are kind of dumb, undisciplined, ""American"" knock-offs of true ninjas). What makes Ninjago so poor in my opinion is that these two ideas have been combined. I just don't find it amusing. Regardless, I must not let this degrade my review, and I will strive for an unbiased review of the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROS</p>
<p>I always begin my reviews by analyzing the Minifigures of the set. I've been exceptionally pleased with LEGO's newer Minifig lines these years, and this is largely the case with Ninjago. ""Jay,"" the blue ninja that comes in this set is a decent figure, but one I don't care for (back to my ""American-ninja"" qualm). His black katana (the same sword piece used in the Prince of Persia (c) sets) is cool too, and I must also compliment the nunchuks. Not only are they quite and advancement in piece-design, but their golden color is&nbsp;just epic.&nbsp;Truly though, I bought the set entirely for the fully equipped and decked-out ""Chopov."" Chopov is hands-down my most favorite figure from the Skeleton Army, and my favorite figure from Ninjago. When I first saw him, I was stunned by his incredible helmet; a black version of the ""battle helmet"" seen in the Green Soldiers of Toy Story (c) in LEGO. Being a history enthusiast, I thought it would make quite a headgear piece for potential WWII Soviet Union soldiers (since their helmets were similar to American ""steel pots""). I tested this out, and it didn't quite work. Regardless, I loved the piece and left it on Chopov. Aside, the new Skeleton pieces are great and have heavily evolved from LEGO Castle's skeletons. The bone-axe weapon is an interesting piece as well. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Skull Motorbike, obviously the main object in the set, is actually a stunning vehicle. It's essentially a gargantuan, almost industrial sized chopper bike with the Skeleton Army's awesome emblem on both sides of it and a ""skull-hammer"" weapon. As far as looks go, it's amazing. LEGO did quite well with the color-scheme of the Ninjago's Skeleton Army, and with all of the sleekness of a real chopper bike, it just works (not to mention thuggish looking exhaust pipes). When it comes to the ""Skull-Hammer"" mechanism, all it is, is lightly moving a nob which pulls a chain with enough momentum to hurl forward a large...skull-hammer. This doesn't at all interfere with the wheels, making it a practical design. The only thing is that one must question how in the backwards world of Ninjago is Chopov going to...harm...the Ninjas when the hammer doesn't touch the ground? It's a wonderfully working weapon that's practically useless, but nevertheless it works and for that I can't complain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONS</p>
<p>The first Con would be how much I dislike the Ninjago story, but that has been well established. My second Con is the fact that the bike has no ""kickstand"" or something to keep it up. In fact, this isn't necessary since it stands relatively well without it. I would've liked to see one though. Next is Chopov's driving method. All there seems to be to operate this machine is a white dome with a purple stud on it. Perhaps (imagination time!) the purple stud represents a fragment of dark magic or whatever, and since the Skeletons have a connection with this, Chopov naturally can use it to steer. Still, it seems just a tad gimmicky. Third, the bones going over the large back wheel sometimes can be accidentally moved to where they hinder the movement of the wheel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OVERALL</p>
<p>I bought this set for Chopov and his helmet. I got a cool bike as a bonus. I don't LOVE Ninjago as a whole, but this set showed me that at least the ""Skeleton Army"" part of Ninjago is cool (but this is me). In the end, I feel this set is worth it overall, especially CHOPOV! 4/5 Final score.</p>

"legoDad42","2011-04-05T18:50:13.157Z","Killer Chopper!","<p>Originally wasn't interested in <strong>NinjaGo</strong> but upon seeing this model built at my local Lego Store I really dug the design of the chopper with the large, beefy back tire,&nbsp;big flames from the exhaust and a great lookin' <strong>skull headed hammer</strong> to smash all in its path!</p>
<p>Also with this kit, the price is right. 157 + pieces and 2 cool minifigs with great weapons for <strong>$15.00usd</strong>, I couldn't pass it up. <em>Note, the clear stand is NOT in the set. I just used it to stage this pic.</em></p>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN4276-2.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Skull Motorbike</strong> is a fairly straight forward build.&nbsp;48-page instruction booklet showing some&nbsp;technic building but overall a satisfying and easy build. No repetition.(For the young ones, help them with the technic parts of the kit to get it right).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chopper measures about 9"" long&nbsp;and about 11"" with the added, large flame pieces and has nice details and a <em>killer</em> play feature I'll go through below visually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts of Interestâ€¦Parts I like...or BOTH!</h4>
<p>Some very cool elements below I feel can really be used for your own Moc's and Mod's.</p>
<p>Of note, I put in the stickers here because of the excellent 'red skull'-like design. These can be great for Moc's and customizing emblems on your mini-figs torso's. Great design!</p>
<p>The golden nunchuks handles are excellent new pieces as well as the golden short-chain. The long bone and the black army helmet are&nbsp;also noteworthy.</p>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN4266-2.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>SKULL MOTORBIKE details...</h4>
<p>Love the look of the chopper. Has the right tilt and slant of a chopper with the smaller front tires and the larger, beefy back tire which helps the model stand up very well. I could see the designers being influenced by some of the art of David Mann or Big Daddy Ed Roth on the Skeleton Army Men's various vehicles. </p>

<p>Head on...menacing, powerful...</p>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN4281-1.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Detail of Skull Hammer...gives ideas for a Ghost Rider bike...also the red 'eyes' act as headlights and the horned handle bars act as tripping and spearing weapons ala' a chariot...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...here you see the engine, gas tank w/purple cap, red stickers are applied to the side covers, also the exhaust pipes and bone mud guards. Note: the white handles on the sides add to the playability...since the bike is oversized to the proportions of the figs, you can attach more Skeleton Army Men to these handles to ride into battle. Also of note, don't worry about the&nbsp;bone guards rubbing against the rear tire. They can be adjusted as far from the tire as you like...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Play Feature: Smashing Skull Hammer!</h4>
<p>Here are the details of the Smashing Skull Hammer. On the right side of the chopper is a technic lever with white cone atop. This is attached to a chain from the engine to the front fork. Simply pull back (a bit quickly though) and the hammer comes smashing down. It can knock Ninja's off thier spinners, Ninja's standing around, Ninja's in mid leap...but if a Ninja is crawling in front of your bike, he's safe. The hammer doesn't fully touch the ground (rests above/over front tires). Although the Ninja would just get run over by the bike...;)<em>Really fun play feature!</em></p>

<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN4286-1.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>MINIFIGS!...</h4>
<p>Here you get 2 minifigs...<em>Ninja of Lightning</em> <strong>Jay</strong> with black samurai sword, removable cowl and his wonderful pearl gold 'new' Nunchucks of Lightning...which is one of 4 Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu (the others are the Shurikens of Ice, the Scythe of Quakes, and the Sword of Fire, found in other kits).&nbsp;You can also find Jay in a couple of other NinjGo sets. Also we have <em>Skeleton of Earth</em> <strong>Chopov </strong>with new black army helmet (often at first glance looks like a Nazi helmet but its the same&nbsp;from the Toy Story Green Army Men), spiked and well detailed armor and bone handled bronze axe! He can also be found in another set.</p>
<p>No spinners here though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Recommend...YES!</h4>
<p>I recommend picking this set up. Cool lookin' skull chopper with great play features, a sturdy model, fun minifigs to add to any collection(with unique weapons), good new parts to add to Moc's and Mod's (gives ya' ideas for&nbsp;Ghost Rider or Lobo style bikes)...all of this for an excellent parts to price ratio! Don't pass it up...:)</p>

"FanofLego","2011-03-14T19:35:36.37Z","Suprisingly, a good set","<p>When I first saw this set on the computer I thought it was the&nbsp;silliest&nbsp;Lego set ever. But when I got it as a birthday gift, I quickly changed my mind. For some reason on the computer it looks bad, but on the box and the real set, it looks cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the computer Chopov has red on his armour, but in the set he has no red,and he is wearing a really cool military helmet (that looks good for making your own military commandoes). I think that the set should come with Nya instead of Jay because Nya only comes with one set. I love the golden nunchuk and the bone ax!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Something I thought was cool was how when you pull the lever beside Chopov, the skull on the front swings forward and hits the ninja if he is standing in front of the motorbike. I like how the skeletons have purple on the vehicles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think it is the best Ninjago vehicle, and it is quite a good set.</p>

"123MrBrick","2012-01-26T20:55:52.24Z","The Coolest Bike Lego Has Made","LEGO has done some very inspirational work over the years (ie: ninja, rock raiders, western).  Though truthfully, 2011 Ninjago sets are the best by far.  I have collected most of the sets including the best skullken vehicle, the Skull Motorbike.  This set includes many rare parts including Chopov's army hat, shown on his character card and only appearing in this set.  The ninja slammer was a great feature, but is better for crushing snakes like Rattla.  I would recommend this $15.00 set to any LEGO fan.

"Wreckagestudios","2017-08-20T18:31:21.983Z","Skull Motorbike-Good set","<p>The Skull Motorbike is a good set. I like how it has a large wheel at the back and two small wheels put together at the front. On the right side there is a lever. When you pull the lever backwards, the large skull at the front swings forwards to try to attempt to stop Jay ,the blue ninja. The back wheel has two mudguards and flames shooting out of the exhausts. Jay has a blue ninja mask similar to the old ninja themes. Across his chest, Jay has sashes and a golden lightning symbol. Like the other ninja, Jay has no back printing. The weapons Jay carries are a black katana and the Golden Nunchucks of Lightning. Chopov comes with a battle helmet and red skeleton armor. Chopov has an angry face and red eyes,like all the skeletons. He wields a bone axe with a bronze blade. Overall, I think this is a good set. My only complaint is that you can see the chain used to operate the skeleton skull however I think it would look better like this than if it was all covered up.</p>
