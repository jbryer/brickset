"LEGOParadise","2010-12-29T11:07:55.7Z","Long Awaited Ice Dragon Does Not Dissapoint!","<p>Lego have made many types of dragons but have never made a Ice Dragon. Until now! A fantastic dragon, brilliant minifigures, this set was definitely worth getting!</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>
<p>Minifig No. 1: Zane, the Ninja of Ice </p>
<p>All of the ninjas have two versions of themselves; a normal and ""DX"" version. In this set, Zane DX is included, the difference beetween his&nbsp;""DX"" outfit and the normal version&nbsp;is a large golden dragon logo instead of his emblem. The dragon on his outfit is exactly the same (apart from the colour) to the Ice Dragon in the set. His name Zane is printed on the back unlike on his usual costume. His weapons are a black Katana (ninja sword) and, stolen by Krazie, two ninja stars. Zane DX: 10/10</p>
<p>Minifig No. 2: Krazie</p>
<p>Krazie uses the same parts as all the other skeletons in the Ninjago theme and reuses a Jester hat from the castle line. The only differences are his blue pants and his face, printed to look like he's wearing red facepaint. He comes with no weapons apart from the ninja stars stolen from Zane. Krazie: 7/10</p>
<p><strong>The Ice Dragon:</strong></p>
<p>The Ice Dragon is made of some pretty interesting&nbsp;pieces (see below) and&nbsp;has a nice sturdy structure.&nbsp;It's head is the most magnificent part&nbsp;of the model though. The head is mostly made up of two moulds, a higher and lower half of a head, which definitely won't appear in any other set, making it a very rare piece to have. Inside the mouth, there is a Bionicle/Hero Factory style launcher which when the top and bottom half of the head is pressed together a transparent blue ball is fired out of the mouth. The see-through&nbsp;ball is meant to represent a ball of ice. The head is connected to the body with a ball joint, allowing it to turn 360 degrees. On top of it's neck is a pole with a printed banner decorated with Japanese writing. The dragon's wings are made of white helicopter blades and support it's paws. It's feet are made of new, large&nbsp;Technic claw elements, joined together by ball joints. Ice Dragon:10/10</p>
<p><strong>Cool Pieces:</strong></p>
<p>1. Power Miners ""Crystal King"" chest piece in transparent blue.</p>
<p>2. Thirteen cheese wedges in transparent blue (one spare).</p>
<p>3. Printed Japanese Banner (4x2 plate smooth).</p>
<p>4. Three golden ninja stars (one spare).</p>
<p>5. All-New dragon head moulds.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;""DX"" ninja costume.</p>
<p>7. Bionicle/Hero Factory ball launcher </p>
<p>8. Six white helicopter blades.</p>
<p>Cool Pieces 10/10</p>
<p><strong>Overall: </strong></p>
<p>This set has good playability (it can be used for Ninjas or Vikings) and is brilliant value for money for just £19.99! Get it as soon as you can! Overall, 10/10.&nbsp;Hope you found my review helpful! More Ninjago reviews from me on the way!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"legoparent","2010-12-31T18:14:27.48Z","A Taste of the Orient On Ice","<p>Purchased the set at a local WalMart.</p>
<p>TRU, Target do not have them on the shelves as of yet in my area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model has an excellent appeal, something different you dont see in Lego.&nbsp; A refreshing staple of the NINJAGO, is that it does not reflect, nor look like Anime, such as the Exo Force theme did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was very easy.&nbsp; Similar parts, some from hero factory (mouth, energy ball, and feet). The colors are striking, and the signature is of course the head of the dragon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigures, well there is the ninja, nothing more than that, and then the clown skeleton which is way cooler than any ninja.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once built the model is a bit top heavy at the head part, depending on how it stands.&nbsp; The wings are a bit flimsy.&nbsp; Would have liked to see longer leg parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also at Walmart, they had the NINJAGO figures, 9.98 each.&nbsp; A little overpriced for one minifig.&nbsp; If you do not care about the ninjago game, the better deal is to buy the sets, which have two or more minifigs with them</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommend it?</p>
<p>Yes, for lego fans, ninja fans, martial arts fans, etc....&nbsp; This model will certainly add a taste of the orient, standing alone, or supplemental to other sets.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,2,2
"asteciuc","2011-01-04T22:34:02.353Z","Great Set For The Price","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Box was a bit thinner than most, but this is probably a good thing for those like me who like to keep the box.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts in this set are amazing, and quite a few are unique. Most will probably gripe about the dragon head, but a new piece is a new piece. It is comprised of a jaw and top head and is made out of semi bendable plastic. It is very durable.</p>
<p>There are quite a few trans blue cheese slopes as well. I absolutely love the color on these. There are about 13 of them in the set. There are also two larger trans blue sloped V shaped plates, much like those neon ones that came with the Crystal King in the Power Miners theme. </p>
<p>The wings are made up of 6 long plates that I believe may be unique to this set. There is no difference in the level of the plate, it is entirely flat. I can see a lot of use for all of these parts.</p>
<p>Also included is a printed tile with some Japanese scrawl on it. I have absolutely no idea what it says though. Still though, printed pieces are highly welcome in every case.</p>
<p>Also this set introduces the shurikens to the LEGO world. 3 of them total, gold.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The minifigures are pretty brilliant. There are only 2 but each one is highly detailed. The first is the white ninja, who has printing on both his front and back and his legs. On the front (legs and chest) there is a make up of the ice dragon he is riding, and on the back is his name (which someone said they didn't like, but I sure as heck love it).</p>
<p>The skeleton is of the new skeleton build, meaning it has new legs, arms, torso and head. Every part of it is NEW. The face is quite disturbing to me. It looks like blood is smeared around a snarling skeletal mouth, although that could be some sort of lipstick, but would that make it any better? The new legs have feet that have shoes, which is appreciated and nice. The arms are also better looking and lend credibility that this minifigure, is in fact, a skeleton.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build is relatively simple. Two feet, two wings, body, tail head. The head is two gigantic new pieces over a ball shooter. The wings are pretty much as shown, as well as the body and legs. The build was very simple, but over all I would have to say that it was effective. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>A little more girth to substantiate the build would have been appreciated, but for a $20 set this is beyond my expectations. This set is pretty large for the $20 price. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The low price, the amount of new, unique, interesting, detailed and absolutely fantastic pieces makes this set a must have in my eyes. </p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"r2d2qa","2011-01-20T14:48:50.283Z","Ninjago is plain weird... But that's a good thing.","<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>So yeah, This set is well... different. You have a white ninja riding upon a dragon with a japanese (I think) flag against a skeletal clown named Krazi... I mean really LEGO? Ninjago is a pretty weird theme, they managed to mix a war between ninjas &amp; skeletons over legendary golden weapons and fight for them by playing a game of Beyblade?? But the best part of this new theme is the rare parts you get in it. I'll tell you about that later, Moving on to the Minifigs.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<div>This set only comes with two minifigs, but it's pretty reasonable for the price of $20. You get Zane DX, a white ninja with a great double printed torso. On his chest is a golden dragon head spitting out ice (Or is it blue fire?) While on his back is a golden, spiky haired lion (I think...) emblem and below it is his name: Zane. His legs are also printed with a gray Karate belt and the golden tail of the dragon. Zane's face isn't very cheerful, he angry eyes and a straight mouth followed with a nicely added chin dimple. He also has the old white ninja headdress with a clip on it's back, where you supposedly, add his black katana.</div>
<div>The next figure, Krazi, was named for a purpose. He's a skellie wearing a rare red &amp; blue jester hat. His face is very detailed, his eyes have red pupils with black sockets and small black slits as well as a gray line on his forehead. Grey lines show his cheek bones, he has a bony mouth showing his teeth, and red marking circling it kind of like the Joker's from Batman. Krazi's body is great, they made a new skeleton body for Ninjago. His torso has printed cracks near the neck, his spine is in a great 3D form, though his skeletal parts seem more straight instead of the usual round. His waist also shows a new printed blue Karate belt. The new skeleton arms are in 1/3 degree angle making them more realistic, they are also grasp able by normal LEGO hands and are a lot more sturdier. He carries two golden &quot;legendary&quot; Shurikens, which have a delta shape and a spike at each point. Krazi's legs are also new, the show the skeletal thigh and the rest is a black boot.</div>
<h4>The Ice Dragon</h4>
<p>Now for the main part of this set! The Ice Dragon, in my opinion, doesn't actually look like a real dragon. The build of it doesn't really tell you the species of it but it's looks like the cross of a Wyvern and the Frost Dragon. The dragon's head is made of a nice rubbery plastic featuring a nice eye, white teeth, blue over white coloring and a orange beard. within the mouth is a mechanism in which you push the upper and lower lip together to fire a blue ball at a great speed but not enough to hurt you. The head has double chain reins to allow the rider to steer the dragon from it's back. It's back has two great new rocky, ice slope pieces and a black and gold pole bearing a white flag with red markings and some Japanese writing. The problem with the flag is it falls off by the simple touch of it and doesn't really belong on a dragon, so it's better taken off. The belly really isn't anything special, and it seems to run write into the head because of it's non-existent neck. The legs are have two joints with white knees and black clawed feet, about five studs behind it is a simple, white tail. The white wings are spectacular, being able to turn 360 and flap like a bird. They can also fold to be straight and spread out. There are 6 light blue 1x1 stud and 3 black thorns on each wing. The dragon has black hands with three fingers and three orange claws. The only thing with the wing is it falls off sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Ratings</h4>
<div><b>Price:</b>&nbsp;For the nice pieces and awesome dragon, $20 is pretty good, so that's a great plus. 4/5</div>
<div><b>Extra pieces:</b>&nbsp;Five extras, include 1 black stud, 1 orange stud, 1 new skeleton arm, 1 1x1 light blue slope, and 1 golden Shuriken. That Shuriken is real cool so I give this a 5/5.<span style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-weight: bold;"" class=""Apple-style-span"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><b>Minifigs: </b>Great figs, with some cool pieces. 4/5</div>
<p><b>Set: </b>The dragon is great and really fun, but a small fort for Krazi would have been a nice extra. 4/5</p>
<p><b>Pieces: </b>Really nice pieces are included in this set, old and new. 5/5</p>
<p><b>Instruction/Build: </b>Actually the build was quite boring, nothing new and crazy. I also saw a printing mistake in the instruction booklet... 4/5</p>
<p><b>Playability: </b>I say this is really fun for little kids, (I may seem old but I still have a childish heart) The problem is it may brake, so 4/5</p>
<p><b>Overall: </b>For a reason unknown, I absolutely love this set and I'm pretty sure others will too. So I give it a 5/5!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really hoped that my review was helpful to all interested in buying this set, It's really nice and fun to play with, as well worth it for the great parts.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
"Orange_Lemons","2011-01-01T15:57:57.737Z","One of the Worst Skeletons Ever","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is basically the same as all the others and the instructions are clear as they always are.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This is where the set really shines. Excellent tans-blue pieces, the weapons are nice, and who can't use more <strong><em>printed</em></strong>&nbsp;Japanese-style banners for MOC's? The only useless part for me would be the dragon's head.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Finally we can get some more ninjas without using eBay, Bricklink, etc. The skeleton is useless and could possibly be one of the worst skeletons ever made minus the arms. The white ninja is great, but the printing<strong><em> </em></strong>on the back with the ninjas name is somewhat useless; although, the front has an excellent design. The ninja's face is nothing special, just a basic face. My only complaint is the skeleton, and skeletons in this theme in general. Samurai's would be much better in my opinion.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>A basic build that almost anyone can complete easily.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>It doesn't look too bad, but it reminds me of a chicken. The banner doesn't seem to stay on very well, and the trans-blue pieces give it the icy look that is meant to be there.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This set is a great set for pieces and the rare white ninja with new throwing stars. I'd probably use this set more for a piece set rather than a display set.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,2,5
"TopperTwist","2011-01-10T18:38:08.59Z","Surprisingly Awesome Set","<h4>First Thoughts:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Being slightly afraid to buy NinjaGo as a TFOL, I went ahead anyways, and I'm very happy I did. This is a very playable set with nice minifigures and good design. Review in short: Don't regret buying this wonderful set for the small price of $20.</p>
<h4>Minifigures:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;You get two figures in this set, which is perfect for a set of its price.&nbsp; Krazy is nice with the uncommon jester hat, new skeleton body peice, new arm pecies, new boot-skele-leg peice, and new shruikens(how do you spell it?). Krazi would have been just&nbsp;perfect with chest armour, though. Zane DX is great, and I think this is currently the only set you can get him in. He has a boring face and mask, but does have a very nice double-printed torso and printed legs. Attatched to his mask is the extremely common (now) black katana.</p>
<h4>The Set:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The dragon included in this kit is perfect. It's a great size for $20, but for some strange reason I pictured it larger. The articulation is awesome on this guys feet and wings,&nbsp; they can move in practically any direction! Also, I can't review this without mentioning the amazing design. Although I think cheap chinese&nbsp;rubber was used on the head, the ball-launching feature on this ice dragon would be fun for little kids. The only problem with this dragon is the (printed!) sign peice towards the area where Zane sits. It falls off with the slightest touch.</p>
<h4>""The Good"" of the Set</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The things I really like about this set are the figures, dragon design, play value, articulatoin on dragon, minifigures, and color scheme.</p>
<h4>""The Bad and Ugly"" of this Set</h4>
<p>&nbsp;As I said earlier, I do not like the sign on this dragon. What's a sign doing on a dragon anyways?</p>
<h4>&nbsp;Final Thoughts:</h4>
<p>Getting past the awful sign, this is a nice set with pretty cool peices for MOCing, nice play value, and tons of fun. This NinjaGo theme is great and I plan on purchasing more. So, $20 is the ideal price, with a decent price-per-peice ratio, and size. Go get this if your in to ninjas and such.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"BobaFett2","2011-02-16T09:48:28.47Z","Fantastic Model, well worth your money","<p>I got this set as a birthday present. I had not expected it-and I was 
very pleased. The set is by and far the best from the winter 2011 
Ninjago line.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box has a very detailed display that is very well done. Beautiful detailing.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set is a bit low on parts for it's price, but it has quite a few unique and new molds, some of which are quite large. The dragon head's jaw and upper part are both great-my only issue with them is that they are rubbery and soft, and that the upper part doesn't fit perfectly on the thornax launcher pieces. There are also 6 long white ""helicopter blade"" pieces, and a lot of transparent soft light blue (medium blue?) pieces, the best being the two ""rock pattern"" pieces. Other fantastic pieces include the claws and the 2x2s with TECHNIC balls/sockets.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get two minfigures with this set: Zane and Krazi. At first I was a bit hesitant about buying this line and I didn't appreciate how good the Ninjas were-but looking at them now, I must admit, the Ninjas are certainly fantastic. The dragon suit is beautiful. The Skeleton (Krazi) is quite good as well-it has arms that aren't overly long and serve the purpose of holding weapons correctly (hurrah!) has some cool new feet, a new body with torso printing, a cool/odd face, and a joker hat.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's a bit simple, but still interesting.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The set is well worth buying. It has many features and looks very good. My main issue is that the shuriken (3 gold ones) are rubbery and more likely to break, and that it's a bit tough/unwieldy to launch the Zamor sphere in the Dragon's mouth. Otherwise, it's great-the wings, the claws, etc-perfect.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I'd highly recommend it. It's great for younger kids, but it should also appeal to older people for many different reasons, not least among them the parts and the minifigures.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Shistavanen_brick","2011-03-29T18:13:26.53Z","Ice dragon comes to save the day!","<h4>Initial thoughts.</h4><div>This is the first dragon, out of four I think, to be released as the ninja's winged companions. In itself the Ninjago theme is new to me, since I mostly collect Star Wars stuff. Although I'm not too keen on the Ninjago <i>game</i> I can still appreciate the Asian style of the Ninjago world. Not too sure about the skeleton army-thing plot, but the kids might get into it. As an adult I rather like the way this dragon is created - but not to a full extent. I'd still say it's price-worthy even if you get it for the retail price (I got mine to a heavily reduced price), as it looks good for display for me as an adult. I reckon kids will have a great time playing with it.</div><div><br></div><h4>The figures.</h4><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; "">There are two minifigs in this set. First out is&nbsp;Zane,&nbsp;our ninja. He's wearing a white ninja garbs with a cool golden dragon printing on the torso. On the back of the hood is a place to put his sword, which is pretty nice. This version of Zane is called the DX version, read on Brickipedia that the Ninjago ninjas only wear their DX uniforms when they ride their dragons. The second figure is the skeleton Krazi. He's pretty much a weird/scary piece of clown-skeleton and has the jester's hat to prove it (!). Krazi has blue loincloth and a scary face. As for the plot in Ninjago, Zane and the Ice Dragon are going to the underworld to find one of four golden weapons. In this case they have to get through Krazi first. The feet on these skeletons look a little bit strange, they might be considered boots or something strange that is in latest fashion in Garmadon's world.</span></h4><div><br></div><h4>Dragon.</h4><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; "">I <b><i>really</i></b> like the dragon!

It has greeeeeat claws that easily can grab a minifig. On top of its back is a sign with Japanese letters that spell ""Dragon God"", but that tends to fall off quite easy. I'm not really sure if it is well placed there, just in front of Zane?

Comparing to the up-n-coming fire dragon, the ice dragon just doesn't cut it. It's not spot on, what I'd expect a dragon's tail to be - for this dragon.

"wander099","2011-03-26T15:36:56.927Z","Best of the January Ninjago Sets","<p>First, I should mention that this set seems to be flying off the shelves.&nbsp; It took several shopping trips to different stores to track one down and it was the very last one in stock.&nbsp; Also, this model is back-ordered on the official lego site at the moment.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is fairly small and shows the dragon in a very nice pose.&nbsp; The instructions are straightforward and easy to follow.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has some great parts.&nbsp; You get the upper and lower jaw pieces, some excellent feet with claws, quite a few transparent blue pieces, orange claws, a printed panel with Japanese characters on it, and three gold shuriken.<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set comes with two minifigures: Zane and Krazi.&nbsp; This version of Zane is one of my favourite minifigures.&nbsp; His torso and legs are both printed on the front with a gold dragon and a belt, and the design is wonderful.&nbsp; I am less pleased with the printing on the back of the torso, I'm not sure what sort of ninja would have his name printed on his clothes (kind of defeats the purpose of wearing a mask...).&nbsp; But overall, an excellent figure and a must for any fan of ninjas.&nbsp; Now, I don't like the skeleton as much, but I suspect that that is because of my age, younger children would probably like this figure a great deal.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, I don't care for the new skeleton torso and I find his legs to be too short.&nbsp; However, he does come with a jester hat which is not a common piece.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was fairly easy, but considering the piece count and that this theme seems to be aimed at a younger age group (in my opinion), that it not surprising.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I love the completed model.&nbsp; While it doesn't look very good from behind (it's body is too small and its tail doesn't look great), when you pose it facing forward or on an angle, it makes an impressive sight.&nbsp; I particularly enjoy how the head looks like when the energy ball is in its jaws and I am pleased with the design of the claws on the wings.&nbsp; The energy ball also shoots very well.&nbsp; It requires enough force that it is unlikely to fire by accident, but not so much as to cause difficulty, and it fires a decent distance.</p><p>However, this model could have been designed better in order to be more pose-able and sometimes the sign falls off.&nbsp; Overall, I like this model.&nbsp; It is very playable and it does fit into some really cool poses, even if it could have been better.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I recommend this model for younger children who will really like the ninja and dragon and enjoy playing with it.&nbsp; I also recommend this for older children and adults who are interested in collecting the minifigure or using this set as a display.&nbsp; It isn't overly expensive and comes with a fair amount of good pieces, so it is well worth the money spent.&nbsp; <br></p><p>I think it could have been better, but looking at the pictures of the fire temple, I think lego might have done a better job on that dragon, especially with regard to the tail.&nbsp; So if the design is a deal-breaker, you would be better off saving your money for that set and getting a cool dragon in a bigger set that looks like it's going to be really great.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4

"Carnistir","2011-10-22T19:33:08.737Z","Good, but...","<p>This is my third review, and my first dragon.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a cool set, but it has some problems.   The wings are irritating, because you're repeating the same thing over and over.   Krazi is a good minifig, but Zane DX is really cool (no pun intended). Posability is limited, making it less playable.&nbsp;For some reason, the ice shooter won't work, but I think that's just my own thing acting up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I'd recommend this to a friend, but I'd also tell them about it's problems.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-30T08:24:18.547Z","LEGO Ninjago - Ice Dragon Attack Review","This set is a really fun set to have and to play with. I also like the design of this dragon. The fins can be folded and the arms, fingers, legs and the feet of the dragon can be moved as well. What I also like about this set is that the head can be squeeze to launch the blue ball. The built is really fun and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. I also can't complain about the number of minifigs we get in this set. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great set to have for sure.<br><br>All

"Dragon_Master_48","2012-03-20T19:40:21Z","A perfect set with a small sized dragon.","<p>Although the smallest of the dragons, the ice dragon still packs quite a punch against skeletons; and those with a small budget.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Folding wings. 
<li>""Ice breathing"" ball launcher. 
<li>Includes an extra arm for Krazi and Shuriken of Ice.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The flagpole sometimes comes off, and make is difficult to place Zane. 
<li>No armor for Krazi.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ice dragon, although still formidable, is not the best of the dragons. However, it looks good when displayed with the other dragons or a building/vehicle.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Matroxide","2012-08-11T13:59:52.087Z","""Feel the chill of the ice dragon and run... before it is too late.""     -Zane DX-","One of my favorite sets I got for my birthday, the Ice Dragon Attack was very impressive and fun to play with!&nbsp;Zane is my second favorite Ninja and looks nice in his DX suit! Krazi, the skeleton of lightning, has a nice Jester Hat , but&nbsp;I realy wish he had his Shoulder Pads! The Dragon, named Shard by Zane himself, looks great for the first Ninjago Dragon set. His Head looks very Japanese and shoots the Ice Sphere&nbsp;with great accuracy. His body has some rare-ish pieces and looks nice although the ""Dragon God"" bearing sign is unstable and falls off easily. The tail is ok, but&nbsp;I wish it had a little more detail at the end like all the others do. Finaly, it's wings are very detailed and elaboratly designed, yet unfortunatly they fall easily because of poor conections. The claws however are very impressive! This is also the cheapest dragon set out there so&nbsp;I highly recomend it!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"EliW","2012-12-25T13:56:58.147Z","Sitting broken...","This set was one of my favorites. Notice ""was"". It was very fun to play with, but I lost the the pole and the flag a day after I got it. The Shurikins of ice were a bit hard to get out of Zane's hands, too. Anyway, eventually, one of the wings fell off, and I tried to put it back on. I somehow made it worse by doing so. Eventually, the entire thing got destroyed and now it's sitting broken in my closet. <br><br>A good set overall, and I would recommend buying it, but ONLY if you're a collector. If you're someone out there who really wants this set, I'm sorry. I was planning on selling it the day before it got destroyed. &nbsp; &nbsp; :) <br>",TRUE,3,2,5,3,4
"Wreckagestudios","2017-08-20T19:53:29.16Z","Ice Dragon Attack-Good set","<p>The Ice Dragon Attack is one of my favorite Ninjago sets of 2011, my favorite is the Fire Temple. I like that you can change the angle of the wings on both sides. It has a tail which curls around but you can change the shape of it as it is possible for it to rotate at two separate points. On both hands attached to the wings it has three fingers/claws. The dragon can shoot a ball of ice out of its mouth by squeezing its jaws together. The head is made of two rubber pieces; the lower jaw and its upper jaw. The legs and feet are attached with ball joints, which allows the dragon to be posed in lots of different positions. Krazi the skeleton wears a blue and red jester hat and has a red ring all around his mouth. Krazi carries the Shurikens of Ice,which he has stolen from Zane,the ice ninja. Zane comes with his DX suit. He has a golden ice dragon printed on his torso and legs and on his hips he has a grey belt. On his back, the ice ninja&#39;s name is written in gold letters. Zane wields a black katana. Overall, I think this set has nothing wrong with it apart from the number of minifigures which is why it is my second favorite Ninjago set of 2011.</p>
