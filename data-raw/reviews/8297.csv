"Kalhiki","2011-01-31T20:32:10.76Z","Buy it ASAP","<p>Words cannot describe this thing's sheer awesomeness. Unfortunately for me, I have to try my best. So enough with the intro, let's get to the review!<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art is superb. The background has a nice Chinese/Japanese type painting look to it. And of course you have Jay and Cole trying their best to defeat the Turbo Shredder by using Spinjitsu. But let's face it, elemental tornadoes cannot defeat Frakjaw and his menacing machine.</p><p>The back features the play features and such. And of course it has the little chart thing with the Golden Weapons. This time the Scythe is highlighted. <br></p><p>When I opened the box I was quite surprised to see this had two instruction manuals. I can't remember what each covers, but I'm pretty sure the first goes over the front and the frame of the Shredder. The second covers the back. But who really care. It's the end product you want.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I'm quite happy with the parts in this set. You get a decent amount of the well sought after purple pieces, and medium sized flames. There are also the pieces that make up the Golden Scythe of Quakes which I like because... Well... It's gold colored. Heck, even the Minifigs are good for parts, so I'll cover that next.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get three (count 'em, three) Minifigs. Cole and Jay are pretty good. Their bodies are nicely printed, but really can't be used for anything else as they have their names on the back. Their faces are also pretty bland. This may be good for making generic Minifigs for, say, a Lego City or something, but not all that great because they don't have much character to them.</p><p>Frakjaw is the star here, though. My only complaint is that the legs are a little short. His body is lovely, but do to the printed loincloth, I can't really see anyone being able to do anything with his body either. His armor is well done along with his very evil looking face. But the thing that makes him shine is nothing that I've mentioned before. He's wearing a rice hat. This makes him officially awesome.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I was quite surprised with how the build turned out. At first I thought it was going to be symmetric, but it turned out far from it. I could tell where I was building, but not particularly <span style=""font-style: italic;"">what. </span>Do to the chomping gimmick, it leaves the build very (and I mean <span style=""font-style: italic;"">very</span>) asymmetric. Some times this was a little scary because I thought I may have lost a piece or the set didn't come with it, but everything turned out OK. <br></p><p>There's also one building technique that I really haven't seen before. It uses large horns (commonly used for tail tips) to make the cockpit. It's kinda hard to explain, so I won't try. <br></p><p>And for those of you who think it's important, the bags come numbered for ease of building.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>My goodness, this thing is beautiful. The shape and design is perfect. I really can't find any flaws with it. Do you want me to try? Okay. <br></p><p>I will admit, the flames seem a little large. But the smaller flames would just be too small, so it's not really a flaw. Also, the chomping action is a little slow. You have to roll it some distance to get a full chomp. And the chomping piece itself is a little wobbly only being connected by one pin. <br></p><p>But it has sooo many shining points. The chomping action (despite being slow) is astoundingly awesome and very addicting. The sheer bulk of it seems like it could take on anything. The spikes on the sides give it a very scary look if the skull on the front wasn't enough. The engine isn't as detailed as the ones from Power Miners, but this isn't PM is it? I simply am having a hard time trying to tell you how awesome this is, so I'm just going to go to the summary.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Get it. You won't regret it. Never before have I been more proud with an over twenty dollar purchase (well, maybe the Lunar Limo, but whatever). Trust me, if you're going to get a Skeleton vehicle, get this. Depending on your budget, you may have to pump out a few extra dollars, but it's well worth it. <br></p><p>Ten out of ten: Highly recommended.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

The&nbsp;unique&nbsp;thing about this set is when you move it forward, the front moves up and down so it can ""Eat people"". Also the fire on the sides is super cool!The money was ok, but I do understand big set, big price. Picture of set my website, bottom right.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-20T11:41:14.3Z","LEGO Ninjago - Turbo Shredder Review","This is my largest LEGO Ninjago set which I own now. For my surprise there're no stickers in this set which you have to worry about. You also can't complain about the design and the play feature with the biting mechanism which is awsome too. If you move this tank the big skull moves up and down which I really like. It comes with some big treads and 4 huge wheels which we've seen in the LEGO Power Miners theme a lot. I also like the big engine which gives this set a nice look.<br><br>The minifigs which are included in this set are Cole (the black ninja), Jay (the blue ninja) and Frankjaw. All of those minifigs are awsome and if you compare Cole to a black ninja from the LEGO Castle (Ninja) theme in 1998 and 1999 you can see that the mask seems to have a different plastic because the new version is more shiny. But all in all I think it's a good set to collect. And I've also been lucky to find this one for 20 Euros instead of 30 Euros.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on LEGO Shop@Home, eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Maelstrom_ninja","2011-03-25T08:50:52.273Z","Wicked awesome","This set is amazing, it goes well with the ice dragon attack set, and if you add ninjas and skeletons, you can make an amazing battle seen, I like Frackjaw and his rice hat, it is pretty awesome, Jay and Cole, well there is more to be said. The jaw chomper thing works really well, I had fun putting ninjas in front of of it and smashing them down.<br><br>&nbsp; The set itself has good pieces and a great color scheme. <br><br>Over all, I have to say, if they didnt have the dragons, the ninjas would suffer a crushing defeat (literally) by the skeletons.<br><input id=""gwProxy"" type=""hidden""><!--Session data--><input onclick=""jsCall();"" id=""jsProxy"" type=""hidden""><div id=""refHTML""></div><input id=""gwProxy"" type=""hidden""><!--Session data--><input onclick=""jsCall();"" id=""jsProxy"" type=""hidden""><div id=""refHTML""></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"perry3836","2011-12-29T20:32:02.417Z","AAAH! It is the dreaded turboshredder!","<p>I like this set! Anyway, I have this set right near me. Many people think this set has 223 pieces, but it doesn't. It includes the turbo-shredder, Fracjaw, Jay and Cole. It is a fun build because you get unusual parts, like big wheels, a triangle-shaped element and rubber treads.</p><p>Of course, now you want to see the finished model. It is a cool combination of a tank and a car. The main feature of the set is the chomping function that works when you push it forward and backward. </p><p>Cons: When the turbo-shredder gobbles up something, it gets&nbsp;stuck on the back. </p><p>Pros: Rare parts, cool figs, fun chomping function, great playability on its own </p><p>Conclusion: If you are just starting getting into Ninjago, then this is a good set to start with. It`s even good to add on to your collection - it is such a cool set.&nbsp; perry3836 :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
"cojack","2012-03-27T15:31:26.44Z","Cool looking set, but playability hampered by poorly connected rear wheels.","This is the third skull vehicle my son and i have picked up, I think the skull truck and skull motorbike are a fair bit cooler than this one. I like the big treads and the bone cockpit(i like all the bone details actually), but what kills this one for me is the terrible connection the rear wheels have to the body, which is made worse by the fact that you have to bear down on the shredder a bit to get the treads to grip enough to move the Jaw thing up and down, and as soon as you do the rear wheels pop off, which kind of kills the fun factor a bit, it's a cool idea, but kind of poor execution, still all of the Ninjago sets have been a pleasant surprise for me.<br>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,4
"Orbitons8000","2012-12-29T11:04:08.397Z","Defeat frakjaw in his massive turbo shredder!","The box is beautiful and great price at 44.99-54.99. Nice Cole, Jay and Frakjaw. My favourite part is the automatic mouth function thats activated by moving the shredder itself. Love the Treads and the Colours. Overall, Great set I reccomend it to everyone.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,4
"Master_Wu","2019-10-22T02:18:28.74Z","Very Good Starter Set!","<p>The Turbo shredder is a very cool set that&#39;s especially&nbsp;good as a starter set!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set includes three excellent&nbsp;minifigures: Cole, Jay, and a skeleton warrior. These minifigures look very good and are fun to play with.</p>

<p>The truck has&nbsp;some very big wheels in the back, as well as some very cool treads in the front. Both&nbsp;its skeleton face in front and big flames in back make it look very intimidating!</p>

<p>This set also has some very exceptional play value. When you push the truck forward, The front of the truck, which looks like a skeleton head, moves up and down and&nbsp;eats&nbsp;anything in it&#39;s path!</p>

<p>This set was fun to build, play with, and display which makes it perfect for any fan of&nbsp;the show or just&nbsp;Legos in general!</p>

"lego_collector_123","2020-08-02T09:25:27.39Z","Great price! ","<p>This set was released back in 2011 with the original wave of Ninjago. It is an imposing part of the Skulkin army and I love the design.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked the simplistic design of the original Ninjas as their clothing resembles traditional Gi&rsquo;s. Each Ninja has a hood piece with a clip on the back to store a weapon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jay: Jay is the Ninja of Lightning so his hood is blue. His face has a single, thin lipped expression with a cut through his eyebrow. The torso&rsquo;s blue robes have dark blue folds, brown rope trim, and a gold symbol of lightning. Unfortunately the figure doesn&rsquo;t feature printing on the back of his torso but due to the set&rsquo;s age that doesn&rsquo;t bother me too much. I appreciate the belt print on his legs. Jay carries a plain brown spear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cole: Cole has the same hood piece as Jay but this time in black. His face is noticeably different to the lightning ninja&rsquo;s with bushy black eyebrows. His torso is also well detailed with grey folds on his black robe. He features the gold symbol of earth and his leg piece is printed with a belt design. He carries a silver Katana.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frackjaw: Frackjaw is a Skulkin and he looks superb. He wears the same conical hat as Wu and has a great face print. His face is printed to look like a skull with red eyes and a metal band repairing a crack in his head. I love the armour piece which features red tipped spikes and a skull symbol. He has the custom Skulkin body design. The torso is moulded to look like a skeleton and has a red printed belt. His arms are in an upright position and can easily grasp a weapon but can&rsquo;t turn like normal minifigures. He has sturdy booted feet. He carries the Scythe of Quakes which is one of the collectable golden weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Set&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I love the design and colour scheme of this Skulkin tank like vehicle. The build is black with striking looking white bone highlights and purple details.</p>

<p>The front of the vehicle has two rubber tank treads which activate an action feature. The treads are very grippy which can make it difficult to move on certain surfaces. The rear of the vehicle has huge, hard-plastic wheels, which spin freely. The combination of the treads and standard wheels, makes for a very imposing looking model.&nbsp;<br />
A menacing, awesome looking skull on the front of the vehicle faces forward with detailed spikes running down the back. The action feature allows the skull to rise up and down and attack whoever is in front of it when the vehicle moves. I really like the inclusion of this feature. A set of ribs line the sides of the cockpit section behind the skull to good effect and a single figure can stand at the controls. Two large flame pieces appear to fire out of the exhaust pipes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is fantastic, it has good figures, a great looking vehicle with an action feature and an incredible price tag. I was expecting this set to retail for $80 - $100 aud but instead it&rsquo;s only $50. This set is quite old so finding it for a good price might be difficult but if you do this is a fantastic deal.&nbsp;<br />
