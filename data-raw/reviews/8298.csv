"Heureusement","2010-12-30T09:21:09.38Z","Ninja Playground!","<p>Just to let you know,this is my very first review here&nbsp;on brickset. Okay then, lets begin!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got this set from my local TRU 3 days ago. At first i didn't know whether i should get this set or not, but in the end i decided to buy it and what can i say, i'm very glad i did! This set is well worth the money (GBP Â£29.99). It includes 2 rare figures; sensei wu and nuckal. Sensei wu is an amazing figure especially as it includes his spinner and new rare wicker style hat. Nuckal is just as good as this is the only 1 of 2 sets that includes him in the first wave of ninjago sets. You also get the white ninja, zane. The bit that disapointed me was when i saw on the box it only had 1 gold shuriken, but when i was in midbuild i found out they always put a spare shuriken in every set there in due to its small size so that made me happy again :-) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now onto the dojo. </p>
<p>The build is as simple as 1,2,3 really although i spread mine over 2 days as i didn't want to get bored once i'd built it. It has a basic chinese look as it includes the huge gateway and panels with chinese writing on them, which if i'm correct are new pieces.&nbsp;I really like these pieces, if i'm&nbsp;honest.&nbsp;The features of this set include dropping axes and spinning swords. Ocassionaly, the swords fall out if you spin too fast or don't push them back in when you've used them (although i never do this, its just what i've heard). The main feature of this set is when you push the pillar holding the gold weapon,&nbsp;the stage area comes flying off. As i have all 4 ninja's and the sensei, i percision them all on the stage for show and then when my friends are looking at them, WHOOSH the stage comes flying off XD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So overall, i think this is a really good set. I would recommend this to anybody who likes ninjago. I've&nbsp;really&nbsp;good fun with this new ninjago theme than any other lego theme before. I've been into lego at the age of 1, when i got the set 7111 droid fighter. So thanks for reading my ninjago 2504 spinjitzu dojo. I'm glad i was the first to review this grand set. </p>

"Brock_the_Builder","2011-01-04T23:06:27.247Z","Great Ninjago set, but not worth US $50","Over the last couple of years, I have been reluctant to adopt certain new Lego themes.&nbsp; Let's face it, Power Miners is the same idea as Rock Raiders.&nbsp; Atlantis is just Alpha Team-Deep Sea, Pharaoh's Quest is Adventurers, and so on.&nbsp; So, when I saw Lego coming out with Ninjago, I wasn't sure what to think.&nbsp; I have all of the ORIGINAL Ninja sets (circa 1998-99) and they are awesome!&nbsp; I looked over the Ninjago sets upon release, but the Spinjitzu Dojo was the only one with enough classic appeal to make me open my wallet.<br><br>So, why do I say it's not worth $50?&nbsp; The main problem I have with this set is that there isn't much substance here.&nbsp; The build is extremely easy and only took 1 hour!&nbsp; Upon opening and spreading out the parts, you will be feeling short-changed.&nbsp; What struck me the most is the lack of unique parts included with this set-- I easily already had 80-90% of these parts!&nbsp; The only things truly unique in this set are the minifigs and the decorated glass panels.&nbsp; I mean, they couldn't even include 'printed' flags or bricks, so stickers are included for your dis-pleasure.<br><br>The Dojo itself is more of a play back-drop than an actual Dojo.&nbsp; There are no rooms or areas for your minifigures.&nbsp; The sorry little training areas to either side of the main doors can barely accommodate a single ninja.&nbsp; There is a technic pin and open brick exposed on either end to allow for connectivity with other Ninjago sets-- so I am guessing they will all make a circle?<br><br>Overall, even with the mediocre nature of the parts, this is a very cool set.&nbsp; It includes special minifigures, has a great color scheme, and looks very nice when completed.&nbsp; I recommend it to Lego and Ninja collector's alike, but I would suggest trying to find it for a discount.&nbsp; Dear Lego, please include an extra minifig and leave out the trading cards next time.<br>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,2
"legoDad42","2011-04-21T00:20:47.597Z","NinjaGo's Place of the Way...","<p>The <strong>Spinjitzu Dojo</strong> at first glance seems a bit pricey for what it is but the beautiful printed shade pieces, interesting parts overall, playability at a high level and overall wonderful look can ease the price pain a bit. Let's break it down to see if it's worth it...</p>
<p>[img]http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y174/PencillerZero/DSCN4427-3.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>At 373+ pieces, the dojo measures about 15"" long and with the&nbsp;outer walls bent in (with hinges), it's about&nbsp;13"" long. Comes with 3 minifigs., 1 spinner (exclusive to this set I believe), &nbsp;1 character card, 4 battle cards and a wealth of weapons (17 in total)! There are also 2, 44 page instruction booklets with 3 numbered bags separating each section of the dojo itself.</p>
<p><em>Note: At end of this review I'll show a scan of a nicely illustrated map, showing the locations of the Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts of Interest...Parts I like...or BOTH!</h4>
<p>Right away the Japanese printed screens/shades are fabulous standouts. Beautifully printed pieces that can definitely add a great touch for your Moc's and Mod's.</p>
<p>Of note, the&nbsp;<em>Golden Shuriken's of Ice</em> are all new, unique weapons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary and Cons...</h4>
<p>This is a nicely designed and wonderful playset (it also appears to be modular so you can add onto the sides additional NinjaGo sets or MoC more walls to enclose the set). Lot's of fun traps for you and your kid to begin training your Ninja, plus great parts for Mod'ers and Moc'ers...BUT, for the price it's lacking a couple of things... </p>
<p>-No spinner arena (like the starter set 2257). You can remedy this by checking that set and building it with minimal technic pieces.</p>
<p>-No spinners for Zane or Nuckal. Big oversight here. But not really since they WANT YOU to go and buy the other sets. Big con for me, since this is just a money grab by Lego. Makes parents have to buy another set to complete this one.</p>
<p>-Price. If they addressed the above 2 cons, this wouldn't be an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As much as I love this set, I'd wait for a sale on this. It should've retailed for $40.00 tops, so wait for a sale on this and you can put the extra money towards getting another spinner and building your arena.</p>
<p><strong>Recommend</strong> <em>(only on sale though).</em></p>

So, I'm going to edit it in the hope that it will become more helpful to you ignorant people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As my first Ninjago set and my first Brickset review, this is a really good set for $50. It has three minifigs, Zane with a major spear, Nuckal with a bone axe and machete, and the rare&nbsp;Sensei Wu with a staff and a spinner. The set comes with 5 trading cards: Sensei Wu, Flame Pit, Shaky Bones, Snow Surfing, and Higher Ground. </p>

</li><li>Why did the spinner have to be for Sensei though? Why not for Zane? </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall it is one of my #1 favorite Ninjago sets.

"Gandalf1","2012-01-18T11:23:55.817Z","A Great Set","<p>I got this set 50% off at Target because it had a slightly ripped box. It was a great deal, and the set is very cool.</p>
<h4>Damaged Box &amp; Normal Instructions</h4><div>The instructions were fine, but the box had a rip in the front towards the right, and it also just looked generally beaten. This was just on mine, though.</div>
<h4>Parts (or lack of one of them thereof?)</h4><div>This set had very good parts, and I actually like the stickers very much on the model. But, even though all bags were&nbsp;thoroughly&nbsp;sealed, it was missing a black 1x2 technic brick. Instead of that piece it contained a black 1x6 tile (which is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;not listed in the parts call-out). I filled out the missing parts form, and luckily, that piece is on PAB, so I should probably get it soon. In the mean time, I have replaced it with a yellow one, just because. You probably will not have this problem, though.</div>
<h4>Great Minifigures</h4><div>The minifigures in this set are very good:</div><div><b>-Sensei Wu:</b> Very nice outfit. The beard and hat, both of which are new to this set, are especially good. He also comes with a brown staff, a spinner, two tan 1x2 bricks, and cards.</div><div><b>-Nuckal:</b> Nicely detailed head and, um, neck attachment. He also has a chipped silver sword, and a bone axe.</div><div><b>-Zane:</b> Cool ninja outfit, determined expression. Also has a silver spear-thing, which is awfully big for him, but looks good.</div>
<h4>The Fun Build</h4><p>The building experience with this set was mostly fun and easy, but putting together the three main sections was difficult.</p>
<h4>The Awesome Completed Model</h4><p>The finished model is very sturdy. The highest part is very strong, because it has technic axles running up through it.</p>
<h4>Playability</h4><div>This set is very fun for all ages. it has several cool functions including:</div><div>-falling axes</div><div>-spinning sword obstacle</div><div>-firing darts (flick-fire missiles)</div><div>-exploding floor trap</div><div><h4 style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial; "">Summary</h4></div><div>This set is very good, and if your thinking of getting it, do so.

"Lint","2012-02-11T18:13:58.467Z","Nice Asian Themed Set with Great Parts!","<p>The Spinjitsu Dojo is a very nice looking set that comes with three minifigs: Sensei Wu, Zane and Nuckal. It is made to look like the walls of a training centre (i.e Dojo) and the awesome double doors hide the plinth which holds the golden throwing star. Along the sides of the doors are obstacle courses which feature a number of amusing traps such as axes in walls, flame/spike pits and rotating mincing katana.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-Lots of interesting and useful parts such as the windows, slopes, plates and ribbed walls. There is also a generous quantity of weapons, although most are used in the architecture. You also get 2 of the golden throwing star! I am also in love with these particular wooden doors. Studded doors offer so much opportunity for additional cladding or design.<br></li><li>-Three great minifig designs, I won't complain about the skeleton design this time :D<br></li><li>-The overall design and look of the Dojo is fantastic. The colour scheme works and the architecture is very well asian themed. I like the lanterns.</li><li>-Spinner. This is my first set with a spinner, I actually like it<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Stickerrrrrs</li><li>-Actual quantity of parts is kind of lean.</li><li>-Despite being designed for playability the set is kind of limited in this department as the obstacle courses don't actually play very well. There needs to be more spaces where a minifig can stand in the obstacle course. I also don't have a second spinner so I cannot add the actual Ninjago game as points of playability.</li><li>-As usual I picked this up on a sale with heavy discounting, but I 
remember the original RRP here in Australia and it was a great ripoff</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>Overall this set is worth it if you are either after the Sensei Wu minifig, golden throwing stars or are simply looking for a very good looking asian themed facade. I have a feeling that this set would integrate well into any asian themed MOC. At full RRP the cost for these is steep but I would certainly recommend buying at a discount.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,1

<b>Pilot Season (The Golden Weapons)<br />
2011<br />
373pcs<br />
49.99 USD, 30,99 GBP<br />
3 minifigures</b></p>

<p>The Monastery of Spinjitzu was a recurring location during the pilot episodes,&nbsp;first season, and seventh season of the original&nbsp;<em>NINJAGO&nbsp;</em>television series. Its first outing as a set came in 2011 with the NINJAGO theme&#39;s first wave. The model looks very little like its onscreen counterpart, as you can see, but is still quite good.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The set comes together very quickly, being as it is little more than a slightly curved facade. The traps and training equipment are interesting enough, and the way that the door is reinforced is something I haven&#39;t seen before,&nbsp;but the rest is fairly standard. It feels very flimsy until the last few steps.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>There are several parts of note in the set. In addition to the doors (2), Shuriken of Ice (2+spare), and spinner, there are 4 printed window pane parts, which only appeared here and in the #2507 Fire Temple.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The set includes just three minifigures, although I&#39;m sure much of the budget was eaten up by the spinner. I believe that&nbsp;<i>Zane&nbsp;</i>is the most common of the figures in the set, although he&#39;s one of the rarer ninja figures. I like the original ninja designs- they&#39;re clean and simple, but still look good.<br />
<em><img alt="""" src=""https://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/njo001.png"" style=""width: 245px; height: 400px;"" /><br />
Nuckal&nbsp;</em>also appears in several other 2011 sets, and his distinctive bone Mohawk and eyepatch look appropriately cool and evil.&nbsp;<br />
<em><img alt="""" src=""https://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/njo003.png"" style=""width: 210px; height: 320px;"" /><br />
Sensei Wu&nbsp;</em>is far and away the rarest figure in this set. He only appears elsewhere in the limited edition #853106 spinner arena and #853111 accessory pack. He&#39;s my favourite figure in the set, with two new-for-the-time parts (hat and beard) and fairly intricate printing.<br />
<img alt="""" src=""https://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/njo002.png"" style=""width: 209px; height: 320px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>The completed Dojo is a very simple model. It consists of a central doorway, modelled after a Shinto&nbsp;<em>torii&nbsp;</em>gate, flanked by two hinged walls. Pins allow the connection of sets like #2519 and&nbsp;#2254 . The parts count is low for a set of this size, due to the large parts that create a convincing facade. The stickered parts look nice, but they&#39;re not 100% necessary if you don&#39;t want to apply them.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>The model looks good on display, but it&#39;s really built to be played with. Despite the fragility of the build early on, it&#39;s quite robust when completed, other than some of the flags and other small details. The model is organised like an obstacle course- the ninja can train by navigating from left to right, left to right, or from either side to the centre of the model. The obstacles themselves are simple, but they work very well. I also like the small pools of water and lava that your figures can swing over, they&#39;re an effective use of space. There&#39;s also a less obvious trap in the middle of the model: when an enemy attempts to steal the Shuriken of Ice, which is hidden away behind the doors, the platform under their feet explodes, flinging them back! It&#39;s a fun feature, and one that captured my mind as a child.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is a fun set. The spinner, obstacle course, and trapped floor are great play features, and the model looks good on display. The minifigures are good, but 3 in a $50 set is disappointing, and $50 is too much for this just in general. Of course, it&#39;ll set you back closer to $80 MISB at this point, but it can be found used for $40-60. All things considered, this is a good set at a bad price.</p>
