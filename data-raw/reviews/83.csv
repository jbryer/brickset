This means that they always look a little crooked, an effect that is exacerbated when they're in a line, as cypress trees often are. Their geometry is such that you can interlock the tiers of different trees and produce a variety of interesting shapes. The knob on top isn't small enough to interact with other pieces, i.e. a minifigure's hand.</p><p><strong>Usefulness in a Layout:<br></strong>These trees are of limited usefulness; unlike the usual cone-shaped trees, they don't fit well in a town layout. They have a formal teardrop shape that says 'topiary' more than it does 'tree.' Their large size doesn't help; they look out of place with the usual Lego-scale buildings but are too unrealistic for larger scales like the modular buildings.</p><p>I would never have recognized these as cypress trees, mostly because I think of cypress trees as being much taller and with a more cylindrical or even very gradual cone shape rather than the teardrop of these trees. Real cypress trees are elegant and striking, characteristics that I can't use to describe these trees.</p><p><strong>My Conclusion:<br></strong>They're useful when&nbsp;one needs to cover up something or provide a quick backdrop, but they can't compete with brick-built trees in detail and interest or smaller one-piece trees in terms of appropriate sizing. They're a medium, but not a happy one.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,4
