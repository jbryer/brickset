"Ha876","2011-01-03T19:33:19.237Z","Bullseye","The ninja training outpost is the smallest of the current ninjago but that doesn't mean that its bad by any means. It contains one minifig named Cole who is the leader of the group of 4 ninjas. One of the cool parts about this set is the fact that it comes with 5 weapons and a scorpion(???). The weapons being a bow and arrow, 2 knives, a spear, and a sword(japanese looking). Also, there is target board where the ninja can practice chucking his weapons at. I like how the coloring on it isn't the traditional red and white. The weapons rack/station isn't much but it has a neatly designed lamp(again japanese style) on it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon seeing the package, for some reason it was hard to see what was on it! I guess my eyes aren't yet&nbsp; adjusted to the 2011 very vivid packaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The intructions are step by step, no miststakes, and a very skilled lego builder like myself could put this set together in just a few seconds. Literally, its extremely simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability was surprisingly high! I had a great time pretending cole was throwing his knives at the target then walking up to retreive them, but BOOM. A scorpion is resting by the target. A big one too...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was plain and didn't contain any surprises. But I did notice little technic pins and holes on the side. Which means this set could link up to another one of this set itself or the dojo set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all this would be a pretty average set, but if it was just a tad cheaper, it could be amazing! But as we all know lego's been raising the price on everything. Or maybe its not lego... Maybe its all the taxes or inflation thats been going on shortly. Anyways, I reccomend this set as a treat for a child, a set to keep you busy, or to start your Ninjago collection!</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,2

The final result does look a bit thin. But there are a bunch of accessories to give the impression of a training post, a scorpion piece and a target build for the Ninja minifigure Cole to train at. I noted a clever use of round element pieces to convey the look of a japanese paper lantern hanging from a pole. The base of the set have technic pieces and connecting pin suggesting that this set can be attached to a much larger set such as the Dojo playset I've seen or if you wanted, you could buy 3 more of these and connect them all to form a circular post.</p>

"davy_jones","2011-06-08T06:50:37.233Z","Weapons galore","Set 2516 is the smallest box set in the Ninjago theme. Besides the box sets, the theme also carries bubble wrapped individual character packs with weapons and stat cards. The set comes with a six page instruction booklet, one minifig, weapon holder and target.
The Cole minifig is cool due in large part to his black color scheme. This is further complemented by the scowl on his little head just in case the cover is blown. The main part of the setting is the weapon holder. This is a clever little design, demonstrating what can be achieved with few parts if creative thought is applied. The pieces 4211087 and 4211111 which are at the base, allow multiple units like this to be combined into one ferocious weapons storage facility.

Pros
 
Weapons galore; the list reads: 1 spear, 2 daggers/knives, 1 bow and 1 katana
Cole minifig
Nice color combo for the weapon holder and has a little barrel as well
Lantern is a nice touch on the weapon holder
Good value for money
 

Cons
The target design is a bit gaudy. Since Cole is mastering the Spinjitzu element of earth the colors could be brown or tan which is more in line with his quest and will give the overall 'old world' look to the set.

Note:
Get this set folks. If budget permits, get many. Think about it, ninjas are always shown to appear in groups with black overalls and carrying all sorts of weapons. So with many Coles, you effectively get a covert Cole army. Multiple units of this set will extensively add to your weapon inventory as well. Plus its not really costly.

I very much enjoy the new pieces and weapons which really get the ninja off to a solid foundation of being awesome and able to kick some butt. I also like the very clever use of minor pieces to create an Asian architecture. The bamboo look and especially the Chinese lantern give this small set a great deal of visual appeal. You get a total of 5 great weapons. In fact I am going to use him with my pirate sets, to bring a deadly Eastern flare. I also like the addition of ""extra"" pieces that are very useful and not necessary but very much appreciated, the barrel and the scorpion. Both really increase the playability of the set. Well done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only have two problems with the set:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Dislike the target. Sure the colors match, but it does not look or feel like a true target. a printed tile would have been better.</p>

<h4>Building</h4>The build is decent, probably the best you could get for a set of this size. There are some interesting SNOT techniques in the archery target, and you can connect 4 of the stands to make a small lookout tower.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4>
The best part of this set is the parts. You get a ninja mask, which is always great, a bow, a black katana, a spear, and my favorite part, the double throwing knives. They could be a great supply of Spinjitzu weapons. You also get a ""Black Brick, Modified 1 x 2 x 2/3 with Studs on Sides""<font class=""fv"">, which looks like a camera, and a leaves piece.<br></font>
<h4>Figs</h4>The only fig in this set is the black ninja, Cole. He is carrying a bow and arrow, which fits nicely on the clip on the back of the mask. He has a sort of glaring face. His torso is a robe, and his legs have a belt printed on the belt piece, with ends going down onto the legs.<br>
<br>
<h4>Weapon Stand</h4>The weapon stand is a nice accessory, it has a barrel, clips for the knives, spear, and katana, and a lantern hanging from it.<br><h4>Archery Target</h4>The target is a nice small addition, nothing special, but the target does bend between the target and the base.<br><br>

","<p><strong>2516 Ninja Training Outpost</strong>&nbsp;is one of the smallest boxed sets in the initial wave of 2011 Ninjago sets. Although it&#39;s not much, it&#39;s a fair introduction to the theme, and a good add-on for those who have already started collecting the theme.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not too much to this set that you wouldn&#39;t expect: it&#39;s&nbsp;is easy to build, and features a simple tower or outpost on a base, and a target, presumably for the bow and arrow or throwing knives. One interesting feature on this set is the Technic pin piece sticking out of one side (and a Technic brick with hole&nbsp;on the other). Although I personally do not have any of the sets this feature can be used with, I find it interesting how this set might attach to other sets- although its small size might hinder it more when doing so, as it might get &quot;swallowed up&quot; compared to these larger sets.</p>

<p>The Cole minifigure&nbsp;is a nice inclusion, as I am a fan of Cole, and he blends in nicely with the general color scheme of this set.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

This version of Cole is from the first ever wave of Ninjago so it is quite basic. He includes his black mask which has very high details on it to show that it is cotton or cloth and it is completely Black. His face is a mysterious, yet stunning face which had a scratch&nbsp;down it. His Torso has five streaks of rope on it which connect to a dragon-like badge on the front. Around that it is also ALL black. His Pants are black with a white belt on it. Overall, a very stunning minifigure.</p><p>The Set:</p><p>The set consists of a target for Cole to hit with his brown, detailed bow he is holding. The target is a easy to build but affective piece of the set and is the main part of the whole set. It uses&nbsp;a camera piece they used in Lego studios set at the bottom which you can see is holding the target up. Also, on the right of the picture, there is a detailed stand that is holding all of Coles accessories and weapons for him. The accessories/weapons include: A brown barrel, a black scorpion, a black machete, the brown bow which Cole is holding, a black spear and two hand-knives. Also, at the bottom there is a plant sticking out which gives it a nice effect. You might see that there is two clips on the stand. Well, they are to connect another one of those sets onto it and if you get four, you can have a complete circle of weapons and accessories which is a great feature, overall this set is Awesome!</p><p>The Price:</p><p>I think, personally that the price is a good price for this set if you live in Great Britain because the PPP (Price Per Piece) ratio is 8p PP which is&nbsp;great but in the US, $4.99 takes the PPP to 11 Cents per piece which is dissapointing. Apart from that, their is no problems with this set.</p><p>The Final Rating: I rate this set a 8/10 because it has a great amount of accessories and detail but there is hardly any playability features and the US price is a bit high.

This was my first set from the line and I thought it would be nice to review since I&rsquo;ve just repaired it.</p>

<p>The Good:</p>

<p>- Very cheap back in the day ($8 AUD)</p>

<p>- Cheapest way to get Cole at the time, but he looks a little outdated now.</p>

<p>The Ninja Training Outpost was certainly a good way to get Cole and some cool parts back in the day for some loose change.
