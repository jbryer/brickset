First of all, his face underneath the head wrap is kind of lame, he has a tiny little mouth turned down at one side. I also prefer the traditional ninja chest piece to the dragon one, it looks like cloth, as opposed to t\the dragon ones which just look like &nbsp;pictures on pieces of plastic, they are too two-dimensional. I also think that it's silly that they have the ninja's names on the backs, especially when the names are so dumb. Like really, Cole? Jay? Those are terrible ninja names.</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The skeletons are good, they have the classic floppy shoulders that I like and they are a color I have never seen before.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Arena:</b>&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Something is off. The problem is the two columns that have lamps and weapons on them. The black parts on top just don't look particularly good. I don't know how to fix it, specifically, but in my mind they look like angry little trolls standing there staring at the bowling. And I think that having axes on one side and swords on the other was a terrible idea, they should have just had swords on both sides, having them be different makes the whole thing seem off balance.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The middle column on the other hand looks great with the gold weapons and the score-keeping piece salvaged from the Glatorian.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The arena opens, too, the whole set is flexible and opens out from where the two gray tubes met. I don't know what the purpose of this is, but I like it anyway.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>My favorite part of the actual building, though, are the white flags at the ends of the arena.

The spinner, entirely contrary to my expectations, actually works fabulously, and it is really fun to line up the skeletons and fir the ninja into the midst of the chaos. the spinner itself doesn't knock down the skeletons, so you have to stick out his sword and let that hit them. Sometimes the skeletons will get knocked pretty far. It's extremely satisfying.&nbsp;</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall:</b></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>While there are a few problems, ultimately this is an extremely fun set with lots of playability and spunk. <b>9/10.&nbsp;</b></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is a standard mid-sized Ninjago box. The art is high-quality as always, showing the features and minifigs, but it just seems... peaceful compared to the other 2011 sets. It also mentions that this set includes the exclusive Jay DX with spinner, although the Jay DX figure was released in another 2011 set later in the year. The instructions are easy to follow as always, with the same picture of the set featured on the cover. This set came in three bags to make building easier.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set came with a lot of interesting parts that I had not seen before. There were a few new elements and some older ones in different colors. The weapons in this set have not been around for a while. Jay's spinner is exclusive to this set, and it looks great. Lots of detail, and the gold color looks great. What I found most interesting was that the score counter was actually from a Bionicle gun!<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set comes with six of the old castle style skeletons, but in a new tan color and without the actual skulls. Also included is Jay DX. This version has the same face as all of the others (except for NRG). The golden dragon on his robes shines when the sun hits it. On the back, it has Jay's elemental symbol and his name. His ninja mask can hold one weapon, but it has to have a stick handle, like the extra weapons included in this set. The downside is: Jay Didn't come with cards! So Jay DX does not have a character card.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This set is a bit harder than your average set to build, with the technic parts, and can get a bit repetitive.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It looks great when you are all done, and can connect to other models like the dojo.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would recommend this to any Ninjago fan, because it is great for training!<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Andy317","2018-06-04T18:53:18.34Z","Easily the Best Spinjitzu Set. ","<p>This set is all-around pretty solid. The minifigures are jay and a bunch of skeleton dummies. It would&rsquo;ve been nice to get another ninja, but all the weapons and accessories make up for it. The price to part is above average, as well as the playability. The kids are sure to have fun with this one. Overall, it&rsquo;s a Set I love and probably my favorite of the first wave THAT I OWN. (I still really want the fire temple) I would buy this for $50, maybe even $60 on eBay sealed.&nbsp;</p>
