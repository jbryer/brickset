(Like me!)</div><div>- Cool pieces and elements! It has some good parts like the golden crystal and all the tools.</div><div>- Perfect for the holidays! With Christmas around the corner, it would be a great stocking stuffer!&nbsp;</div><div>- Cheap! It is about $5 and it has many uses! It's great for all those tightwads out there!</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:&nbsp;</div><div>- It honestly doesn't do much. I mean, it's good if you have another set to add it to, but playing with it without any other characters or vehicles would be boring.</div><div>- Few minifigs. I suppose it's alright for the price but still, only one.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall: I think its a good stocking stuffer or a thing you would give to a friend, but its not that great. If you have another Pharaoh's Quest set, like the golden staff one, get it. It is like downloadable content for a video game. It adds a nice effect but alone its boring.</div>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,5

"desire4one","2010-12-16T01:09:14.877Z","Beetles Love Chicken...","<p>This set is a great introduction to Lego's new line of Egyptian themed adventure...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set consists of mainly two parts:&nbsp; The scarab and the campsite.</p>
<p>The scarab is actually quite comendable in that it is a bit more complicated than first impressions.&nbsp; The parts consist of many hard to find pieces that leave the imagination spinning.&nbsp; The leg construction lends itself to many applications, and I'm sure many robots and six legged creatures will arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The campsite is pretty drab, but If your buying this set, its for the scarab beetle.&nbsp; The component pieces don't lend much to a setting, but the accessories are passable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigure here is nothing to write home about, but his hair piece and torse piece may see use elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For $6 your basically paying for the beetle.&nbsp; Fans with large collections may find this set lacking, but what can you expect from Lego for the price of a #1 combo at your favorite fast food joint.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
"ndb","2010-11-30T17:43:18.543Z","Awesome!","<p>When I saw Pharoah's Quest, I let out a whoop of glee for the many guns and bullet straps&nbsp;prints on the mini-figs. Considering I'm a G.I.Joe fan, I see many potentials in this new theme for MOCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mini-fig (Jake Raines) is one of my favorites from the entire Lego line. His rifle is a great addition, considering you can never have too many rifles! Also, I notice that Jake is the main character in the series, and for once, kids don't have to buy a large set that some couldn't afford just to get the ""Hero"".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camp site leaves a bit to be desired, but a turkey leg and the new fire piece is always welcome to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Scarab has a fantastic, sturdy&nbsp;build, and for those who abhor stickers, the shell is printed. I find that I haven't seen the horn piece in any other sets, although I could be wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The piece is&nbsp;a bit expensive, $5.99 USD at Toys R Us, but can be expected with rising plastic prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, this set is awesome! It really appeals to me, but for some, it may not their cup of tea. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves steampunk, military, adventures, or zombies. I think you could find many use for this set.</p>

Let's get right into the review.<div><br></div><h4>Minifigure:</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The one Minifigure we get is Jake Raines, who I believe is the main hero in this theme. He has messy hair and a nice yellow head with cool sideburns and a small beard. He's smiling in a determined way.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>He has a new torso with a jacket and a white shirt. He has bullets in that bullet holder/ sash he's wearing, which continues on the back but without the bullets. He's wearing a brown belt with a silver buckle. He has these nice light tan legs too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><p>Crate:&nbsp;</p><div>In this set you get three other features besides Jake Raines. One of them is a weapons crate. It's basically a common brown box where you can put your&nbsp;accessories&nbsp;in.&nbsp;</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Accessories:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>First, you get a gray rifle which is in all the Pharaoh's Quest sets I own so I think they're in all of the sets. It's a nice addition.&nbsp;</div><div>Second, you get some binoculars, which are also gray.</div><div>Third, and best of all, you get a cool gray pick ax. with two 'blades' on either end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Fire/Food&nbsp;</h4><div>I don't know what to really call it. It's basically a few thin pieces with some rock-like pieces topping it. On top is a red cup. There's some chicken in this holder which is held above a fire. or one little flame piece. It really is nothing, more like something Lego threw together in a minute. But it's still a good touch.</div><div><br></div><h4>Scarab Beetle</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Obviously the best part of the whole set is this wonderfully detailed Scarab Beetle. He's got this little head which has two gold studs for eyes and a large black jagged knife for some kind of horn which reminds me of a unicorn.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The head attaches to the rest of the body. There's six legs that attach underneath a large blue shell. The dark blue is very cool. It has some printed designs on it, like the Eye of Horus, a Lego brick,&nbsp;etc. There's some sand printed and what looks like clay brick. Overall, great Scarab Beetle.</div><div><br></div><h4>Gold&nbsp;</h4><div>This is the point of the set, really. It's a piece seen often in Power Miners set, it looks like a jagged rock but it's colored gold. I can't say much but it is a very cool piece.</div><div><br></div><h4>Overall</h4><p>This is a very good set, and was worth the price. Any Pharaoh's Quest fan must have because of the beetle and gold. I would highly&nbsp;recommend it to anyone who likes interesting/rare pieces. The beetle is&nbsp;definitely the best part of the set and my favorite. Thanks for reading!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5

<p>I got this set for Christmas and I am glad I did. The Pharaoh's Quest sets have really jumped out at me in the store. Anyway, this set is nice way to sample or whet your appetite for PQ sets. Having each of the PQ&nbsp;sets&nbsp;sentered around the six treasures different treasures of Amset-Ra is a nice little gimmick--it makes the little gold treasure that comes with this set&nbsp;seem extra special.</p>
<p>For a small set, the build was quite enjoyable. It especially was very interesting to see the beetle come together. It is very articulated which gives it some personality.</p>
<p>The blue printed pieces are very detailed and well done. I especially like the hierogliphics: an eye, a lego brick, and a scarab. I looked up the meaning of these glyphs and the eye means ""to make or do"" and the beetle can symbolize a scarab or mean ""what has come into being.""&nbsp;So the whole sentence can roughly be translated as ""I made a lego scarab"" or ""I made what has come into being."" Granted, the eye of Horus and the Scarab were also used charmed symbols in their own right, but if the sentence was intended, it was a nice touch on Lego's part.</p>
<p>Jake Raines is a nicely detailed and fun figure. His accessories--the gun, pick-axe, and binoculars--add a lot of play value.&nbsp; The little campfire provides some nice ambiance and one can never have too many chicken legs! All of this allows Jake and the beetle to interact in many different ways. I currently have Jake hiding the gold behind his back, while befriending the beetle with some chicken. Nom nom nom.</p>
<p>Anyway, in conclusion, this is a fun little set with a lot of character and playability for the size.</p>

I'm impressed in many ways...<br/>&nbsp;<br/>First off - Huge Kudos to Huge Nerd for pointing out about the hierogliphs and it's translation to ""I made a lego scarab."" That makes it an awesome touch on LEGO's part with this set.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>What's also great with this scarab set is a return on LEGO's part to more printed pieces instead of stickers. The Atlantis Monster Crab Clash requires stickers, it is/was in the same price range as Scarab Attack. While not as big and bulky as the other set, the Scarab is fairly well articulate and looks great.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The minifigure Jake Raines takes the place of Jonny Thunder from previous incarnations of LEGO's Adventurer and Orient Themes. I suppose he'll be alright. He comes with several accessory pieces, which can be good or bad in terms of MOCs. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Special is a gold piece that's part of the series of treasures that Jake Raines and his team are searching for in this theme. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>The campfire is a bit uninspired, about it's only draw is the chicken leg being roasted over it if you're shy on this type of accessories for your MOCs/Collections.",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4

"K_nut","2011-02-25T11:18:32.157Z","A very good set for many uses.","<p>When the new Pharaohs Quest line was announced, I was very excited, being an Egypt buff and loving anything to do with adventure. So when I saw this set at TRU and bought it, I was very surprised about what was found inside.</p>
<h4>Minifig</h4>
<p>A very nice figure for a set this size. Jake Raines does not have a&nbsp;reversible&nbsp;as seen on LEGO.com, but does have very nice back printing.</p>
<h4>Scarab</h4>
<p>The star of the set, the scarab has a very good design and is able to be used as an army builder. The best part about the scarab was that there were no stickers, and the back was a printed tile. If you are into Bionicle, the scarab can very much be used as Mata Nui's friend, Click.</p>
<h4>Other stuff</h4>
<p>This set is a very good way to get a pearl gold crystal, used as one of Amset-Ra's treasures. The design of the campfire is simple, yet affective and has a few useful parts.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>This is a very nice way to get Jake Raines, A desert creature, and a few parts. There would have been more playability if it came with a mummy, but it's still a very good set. If you are a fan of old adventurer's sets, this is a must buy. I'm very glad I picked up this set and I hope there are more waves to come.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had a blast putting it together too.&nbsp; He even counted all the pieces (there were 48, not 44 as the box stated, so yay extra pieces for him!) I have to admit, much like the Flying Mummy Attack I also purchased, this line is rapidly growing on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets get down to it: You have 1 of the 6 treasures (gold rock/crystal) the main character, Jake, some anti-dung beetle Jake accessories (shotgun and pickaxe) a box to put them in and Jake's lunch (turkey leg and cup o' joe) both of which rest on a makeshift lego campire that you build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main treat is the Scarab.&nbsp; I have not built too many lego beasties, but this one was very impressive in build (well from what I saw watching my son build it).&nbsp; A nice deep blue shell with printed (for all you anti-sticker peeps) bricks and worn hieroglyphs, individually moving legs and head - good for poseability, and a well constructed body really gave it a more organic realistic look than as a Lego scarab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scarab is&nbsp;fun and small&nbsp;and should be displayed at the office or around the house.

"sharpleaf","2011-12-02T19:24:54.24Z","A great little set","<p>Well, the set is not as big as you would expect, but it has good parts.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is perfect to place the set inside, and the instructions are very simple to follow, but it comes folded (it's a booklet, but they have folded the booklet) and sometimes it re-folds itself when you are following them, so that is a little anooying, but it's because of the box's size.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The main reason for buying the set. It comes with another of those golden crystals. It's my third one, but this one is the first gold crystal ever to be made in golden plastic, not dark grey plastic with a kind of printing in it, and I really like that.</p><p>Jake has a shotgun. I always thought it was just like the old ones but it is a little redesigned so the minifigs can hold the handle from above.</p><p>The scarab comes with a lot of useful parts, mainly the arms, the main brick in the body, the horn and the shell. It is almost only useful parts.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Jake Raynes is probably the main character in the theme.</p><p>The hair: It's a common brick, but in black, which is not so common.</p><p>The head: Only one side printing, with &nbsp;a scar and beard.</p><p>The torso: Double printed, with an bandolier for holding ammo.</p><p>The legs: Plain dark tan legs.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's pretty easy, because the set is really small but i'll give you one hint: turn around the scarab legs so the black part is holding the body and the light grey claws are in the ground, it becomes a little weird but much more stable.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The campfire is really just a filler and parts out with ease, but the scarab (if modified as above) is very stable.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Don't buy it for the campfire. Really. There's nothing good on it except the fire itself.</p><p>But I strongly recomend you to buy it if you want the scarab or Jake.

"Odeinoichus","2012-01-09T17:58:33.357Z","The Scarab Rises","<p>Set # 7305 Scarab Attack: It has been a while since my last review so now I shall get the reviewing of sets I should have finished by now reviewed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We start up with a small set called Scarab Attack from the Pharaoh's Quest Theme, this set retailed at 6.99$ CND and served as a smaller set in order to get the main character of Jack Raines from the Pharaoh's Quest storyline. This would mostly be the reason for older fans of the Theme to buy it, on top of the Scarab creature itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the Scarab: This takes relatively little time and will be quite easy for most builders. The Scarab itself is a nice looking creature reminiscent of those found in the Atlantis Theme, his torso and insect legs are kind of built up using techniques similar to those of the Dwarf Spider Droids found in some Star Wars sets. The main draw of the Scarab is the unique printing on the large back shell of the creature, with heiroglyphics and brick patterned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the Rest: Jack Raines is the only Mini-Figure in the set, and there is a small campfire/desert site for Jack. It includes a red coffee mug and a LEGO Turkey leg, accessories include a large crate, a pickaxe, a pair of binoculars and one of the Western Rifles introduced way back when.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is pretty simple to build, as I already pointed out, and once you've built the Scarab,you're kind of stuck with very little to do unless you have more of the Pharaoh's Quest Theme to include with it. It might be a decent set to buy up more of if you want an army of little scarabs to run around, but there isn't much of a point to it honestly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall: I'd say this set is a decent enough impulse set for the younger collectors, it offers some fun accessories and a bit of an adventure to play with between the scarab and Jack, but all in all without larger sets from this Theme to compliment it doesn't do much. However it does also include one of the shiny looking crystals from the old Aquazone theme in a nice new color. I'm not sure what this Ore Chunk might be used for, but it is a unique color. Not quite the same as the golden tones of the crystal from the Blacksmith Attack set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd have to say that I recommend this more for the Scarab than anything else, and if you could find a way to get the printed brick that makes up the back of the beast you could easily make it with pre-existing parts from your collections.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4

<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts in this set are largely unremarkable except for the gold crystal and the printed pieces from the scarab.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>With this set you get Jake Raines, but as he comes with other sets, that won't be a reason for buying this set.&nbsp; I find this minifigure kind of boring, especially since this identical figure appears in two of the other Pharaoh's Quest sets.<br></p>

<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The sole reason to buy this set is for the scarab.&nbsp; I am quite impressed with the design and the printed pieces are gorgeous.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This set is very cheap and if you are a fan of the theme, then I would recommend getting this set just for the scarab beetle.&nbsp; Personally, I think it makes a nice display piece and it doesn't take up much room on a shelf or a desk.&nbsp; But if you value playability, then I would get this set with one of the other smaller sets (or bigger ones if you like) so that it is more fun to play with.<br></p><p>I would not advise getting this set for a young child because the set is made up of a couple of main pieces and some of the other pieces are basically loose (the crate, crystal etc.) and may get lost.&nbsp; However if your child is older or good at keeping their things together (i.e. not prone to losing bits), this shouldn't be a problem.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>&nbsp;Estimated size of the box 4.75 x 3.5 x 2 inches which is a small box that can be added as extra orders for space fillers when you order big items online. (That is what I did). The instruction is a small booklet with 12 pages for the build. Fairly easy to do, even my 5 yr old daughter was able to follow.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>44 pcs, with printed body part of the scarab. No stickers! The extra pcs included are: 1 orange flame, 1 gold stud, 1 gray like arm clamp (not sure what it is called but it is the one that connects the scarab leg to the body) It comes with a pick axe, rifle, binoculars. together with a golden rock, red mub and a chicken leg.<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Only 1 together with the weapon and items I mentioned above. No hat or cap but just the black hair.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>After the usual minifig, you are asked to build the camping/cooking area and then the scarab. I like the way the scarab is connected both the body and the legs using the circular part for the underbelly as the main attachment for the 6 legs.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Simply very nice. The scarab can be positioned very flat to semi standing (front legs above the ground) to almost full standing such as it is trying to devour the minifig posture. You can even clamp the legs of the scarab around your finger to sort of make it as a ring. The head is also movable and can be posed in different angles.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>For 5 dollars with a nice scarab and accessories, this can be bought again and again to build up your scarab army. Something to consider if you like this theme or something you want to create using bugs.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"Ernst","2016-05-16T17:56:59.087Z","Kill the Scarab and let the Quest begin !!","<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Overall 4 bricks :</strong> The starter set of a great theme, a bit Adventurers 2.0 !! I love these small starter sets, most of the time with 2 mini figures but here 1 figure (the hero : Jack Raines) and a Scarab. A nice introduction set for a friendly price, not a must-have but a welcome addition.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Building 3 bricks :</strong> Not a great building effort, first the small camp part and after that the Scarab. Not difficult and a nice result.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Parts 4 bricks :</strong> The leading mini figure of the theme : <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?M=pha009#T=P"">Jack Raines</a> and several nice parts here. The most special parts are in a way the less useful parts, the 2 <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=47753pb020&amp;idColor=63#T=P&amp;C=63"">Scarab shield parts</a>. The only other way to use this are maybe as decoration in a building or something like that. Still they are very nice and printed, no sticker !! Overall nice parts and several useful accessories. With a mummy mini figure added it would have been 5 bricks here.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Playability&nbsp;3 bricks : </strong>Jack has to beat the Scarab, end of the challenge... But these small sets are mend to be added to your other Pharaoh Quest or Adventurer sets of course, than they become more useful.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Value 4 bricks : </strong>For some &euro; 5,00 or less you can find this lovely small set. Always a nice addition for kid to play with, for an AFOL for parts and certainly for a collector. <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?S=7305-1#T=P"">Bricklink</a> even offers an average value below that.</font></p>

<p>I got this set at the end of 2010 but hopefully you can get it still this year. I got this set mainly for the minifigure, since he is the spotlight of the set. It's also the cheapest set to get Jake Raines. Bye. Happy building!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"Graysmith","2012-01-09T19:48:18.947Z","It Comes At Night!","I bought this on a whim at a discounted price and I'm so glad I did because the scarab beetle in this set is just gorgeous! Not only does it look great, but it's also really cleverly put together which makes it really fun to build. The dark blue shield pieces are also printed which gives it that extra something. I'm really thinking about buying a few more of these sets just because I'd love to have a few more scarabs.<div><br></div><div>As for the rest of the set, you get some nice accessories including a golden crystal piece but the campfire leaves a bit to be desired. I love the idea of a campfire and the scarab attacking at night as our hero sleeps, but it could and should've been so much more (even for a small, cheap set like this). Luckily an extra flame piece is included so it's certainly possible to build a better-looking campfire though you'd probably need to get some pieces not included in this set. The minifigure is quite nice looking, but certainly no Indiana Jones.</div><div><br></div><div>Bottom line: If you think the scarab looks cool (and trust me, it IS cool), get it!</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Zatth","2012-02-07T19:45:48.857Z","Scarab Attack: Jack Raines has all he needs......","I am not a big fan of Pharaoh's Quest, but his little set that I picked up one day stuck out at me. Although it is the smallest set of the theme it has a lot of punch for it's money (despite a price label that was often all too high). <br><br>As the title suggests, the set includes a lot of equipment for Jack Raines. He gets a mug, a fire, a chicken leg, a pair of binoculars, a pickax, and the signature rifle. As a bonus, an extra piece that my set included was a wrench. Why am I highlighting this? Because this adds a lot to the set's playability. Despite the small size, I have had far more fun with this set than the size might suggest. The wide range of equipment means that our intrepid hero Jack can get into many varied (and potentially humorous) scrapes with the armored Scarab beetle. Speaking of the beetle, the Scarab is a nicely designed model, quite articulate and colorful. It would certainly make a great addition to a larger set to increase the ranks of Pharaoh Amset Ra's horde. For those interested, the hieroglyphics on the back of the beetle roughly translate into ""I build a scarab"". Lego has such a canned sense of humor.......... but a fun addition nonetheless..... :)<br><br>So, how does this set stack up? Quite well. Despite the poor $6.95 retail price tag. If you can obtain this set at $5 or under and have an interest in Pharaoh's Quest or a stocking stuffer set, then I would get it. With some good creativity and imagination, this set has a lot of playability and life in it. Cheers!<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
