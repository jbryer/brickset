It came out way ahead of said release and&nbsp;TRU did not&nbsp;overpriced it. I even visited our local Lego store and&nbsp;got them&nbsp;atleast a couple of weeks ahead. Now on to the review:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As expected to these kinds of sets, this is more directed in building up your minifigure as to the build of the small set that goes with it. Minifigures are awesome most specially the mummies, I love this them as they really looked menacing and they have two printed faces, one with just an eye showing and the other with teeth showing. Accessories themselves are very nice, specially the scarab shield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hero minifigure is also cool, but what I think is the highlight for me is the motor bike. I have not seen this kind of bike as of yet so I do think its new. I also love the color scheme of everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Golden Staff altar is the usual build, simple but it does serve its purpose. Golden Staff is very nice, can work as a great Egyptian decoration if you would customize your own pyramid. All in all this is a great set, specially if your getting ready to raise and army of mummy and take over the world.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"cassidyarch","2010-11-20T22:12:54.26Z","A lot to love in a $9 set!","<p>This is a terrific small set. The motorcycle has great detailing and printing. The figures are beautifully printed (front and back) and a lot of fun. I didn't think I needed an army of mummies, but I do now.</p><p>The small assortment of pieces is nice too. There are, unfortunately, an <i>odd</i> number of dark tan slopes (7) I wish it had come with eight, but I guess I'll just have to buy two sets to even that out. For the price, a great little set.</p><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"joetheman","2010-11-27T16:56:30.027Z","Pretty Awesome","This set is a nice small set that has lots of cool new pieces and an overall pretty good set.The best part about this set for me are the mummies (including accessories)and the new motorcycle cover that is very detailed and with the maroon coloring makes it even better.&nbsp; Overall I give this set a 5/5.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"vamproe","2010-11-23T14:17:05.73Z","The set is a true treasure, great start to the Pharoahs line","<p>First: The set is a rather quick build about 10 minutes, if that.</p>
<p>The bike is one of the best parts of the set, a brand new bike design, can see getting extra bikes for customizing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifures are good too, at least the mummies are great. Love the double faces, the more options the better !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The staff alter it's self is nice too, I really like the spot on top of the staff to put a gem. Really gave it an Indiana Jones feel to it.</p>
<p>a few extra alters to make an ancient catacomb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over all a really nice set, lots of play for the $$, This set would make a great stocking stuffer.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,4

"desire4one","2010-12-16T01:21:33.527Z","Protect the golden tooth pick!","<p>This is another great introductory kit for the new line of Pharoh's Adventures from Lego...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set doesn't seem like much at first glance, but actually offers a lot, for the avid collector and the little guy with some imagination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set consists of an old, 1930's style motorcycle, the small structure, and the minifigs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The motorcycle is surprising novel, and brings to mind scenes from a certain archeologist turned adventurer.&nbsp; It can fit into a variety of themes, and due to it's maroon color, sets it apart from other cycles out there.&nbsp; There's a small possibility for building expansion on the cycle, and a skilled builder may attach a trailer cart, a machine gun or any other number of ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The structure suits it's purpose, but doesn't draw a lot of attention.&nbsp; It makes an interesting eye piece for holding the unique golden staff, but other than that, how much can you do with it.&nbsp; Minifigs can't even hide behind it very well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The big selling point with this set is the Mummy minifigs.&nbsp; They just look plain evil, and Lego is improving on it's minifigs with every set (as well as the raising the prices).&nbsp; These two red eyed fellows are begging to rise from your lego chest to enact curses millenia old.&nbsp; The adventurer seems alright, but would apeal more to the collector is he had flesh colored hands and head.&nbsp; Yellow colored minifigs just seem to peg themselves into a certain group, with little use elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line is, for around $10, this set is worth picking up.&nbsp; It even has 4 small pieces with sharp angles on 3 of the 4 sides.&nbsp; I've not yet seen this piece, but I'm sure I'll find a use for it somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kick some sand up and defend the golden toothpick!</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,4
"Kalhiki","2011-02-13T20:25:19.453Z","One of the better 10 dollar sets","<p>I'd like to get all the Pharaoh's Quest sets, so I was going to get this anyway. I was a little iffy at first, but the mummies and the staff drew me in.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is a little bland in my opinion. Sure it has some nice CGI pictures and an Egyptian feel, but the tan. The tan doesn't really stand out on the shelf. Compare it to, say, a Ninjago box. The Ninjago box will stand out much more. But who cares about the box, it's what's inside that you want...</p><p>The instructions! Fooled you, didn't I? No? Fine. The instructions are paper. It's a booklet. Step by step building. Easy to follow. Now enough of that, on to the set! (no joking this time) <br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>The only reason I rated this a five was due to the Staff, the mummies, and the bike.<br></p><p>The Mummies will be covered next, so we'll look at the Golden Staff. It's a very nice piece. However, it seems a little empty. Luckily if you have, say, the Soul Diamond from the Flying Mummy Attack set, there's a place where you can put a diamond in the tip. I haven't tried this, but I've seen pictures, and it looks cool.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Mac: There's really not much to say with him. His pants are a solid color, so nothing there. His body's nice with his suspenders and white sleeveless shirt. You can also see the outline of his six pack on his shirt along with some grease splotches. Judging by his gut muscles, I doubt this grease is from a cheeseburger.</p><p>The head is good. No flip head, though for a scared face. He's got stubble, a little scratch on his cheek, and a very quirky smirk that seems to say ""I'm gonna get past them mummies and take there Staff"" right before he chucks the dynamite at them</p><p>Now the Mummies. These guys are gorgeous. Their legs have a blue... robe, I guess (I really don't want to call it a skirt, but that's all I can think of). And they have a nice gold belt to hold up their... waist cape, there. That's what we'll call it.The body has some nice printing with it's wrappings (that are also on the back). And they have a gold collar thingy (obviously I'm not acting like I know everything). <br></p><p>The head is nice. This has double printing. One side has one eye visible, while the other has both eyes and a mouth. Luckily, you have two mummies, so you can use both at the same time.</p><p>Then he has his hat (or Nemes as I've heard it been called), sword (or kopesh, I believe), and scarab shield (or... nevermind). I would go over the other mummy, but that'd be stupid.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It was simple. I'm not going over it. Just one piece on top of another.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4> The bike is a very nice motorcycle. It's equipped with headlights, and a
 little back piece to hold the rifle (awesomeness) and the... Dynamite? 
Yes, there's dynamite. I'm not quite sure why, though. It doesn't seem 
to fit this theme. Not much to it really.<br>The... Pedestal, let's call it that, is quite nice. For it's size it's quite detailed. You can tell it's basically made of sand and rock. It also has a little plant which was a nice touch. <br>The main feature in this set is the Staff ejector. hitting a little peg in the back will cause the staff to pop out. However, you need to use some force to get it out. Just pushing won't work. There was a slight modification I made to this. I used a small Technic piece to prevent the 'button' from flying out with the staff.<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall... Gee... I don't know what to rate it. It's a very simplistic set, which makes me want to rate it low, but small sets are going to simplistic. Tell you what, it's a good set. Maybe not the best, but not the worst. It's a little small for a ten dollar price point, but not by much. If you get it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.</p><p>8.5/10, decently recommended<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"legospongepotter","2010-12-22T19:51:02.58Z","A Great Set, a Great Theme, a Great Title","<p>This is my first and only Pharaoh's Quest set, though I hope to get the Scarab Attack soon.</p>
<p><b>Minifigures:&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b><i>Mac McCloud</i></b><i> </i>- Very nice minifigure. &nbsp;Many assume his legs are normal brown but I have realized that the shade of brown is different than normal. Not a big difference, though. Just slightly darker, but its almost impossible to notice. He has a great torso which I think is new. He has a&nbsp;sleepless&nbsp;shirt&nbsp;on and you can see his chest sort of. There is some brown/dark red stains on his shirt that is probably dirt, but it could be blood. Around his neck and armpits you can see his hair. Then he has these red...suspenders? I think so, and they got these silver buckles. On the back is just the back of the suspenders and it shows where his arm meets shirt as well as the front. I like his head. He has lots of stubble and a half-smile. He is sort of squinting because his eyebrows are close to his eyes, and this makes sense because he is in the desert. He has a scratch on the side of this face. No double-sided face. You also get a great brown aviator's helmet with gray goggles that move up and down, though he looks weird with them on. The goggles just look to big.</p>
<p><b><i>Mummies</i></b><i> </i>- I don't know if this is good or bad, but the two are identical twins. Their legs have these nice dark blue rags or ripped robes that have great detail. Their torsos are covered with bandages that look very old, a great feature. I don't know what it is called but it has this half circle that is golden besides these great dark blue designs. You get basically the same on the back, a good thing. I love these heads. On one side they're covered with bandages and you can see two mean red eyes (according to that new book by Rick Riordan, The Red Pyramid, red is the Egyptian color of evil instead of black so that's cool) and his teeth in a snarl. &nbsp;On the back the mummy's face is covered with bandages besides one red eye....spooky. As for&nbsp;accessories, you get a great&nbsp;scimitar, or curved sword, that is very detailed. Then you get another weapon, for defense this time, a well-designed shield made to look&nbsp;like&nbsp;a scarab with a handle in the back and great markings in the front. On their heads you get to put a wonderful headdress that fits well and is very detailed with good markings. There is also a spot to put a stud in the middle of the head. It is a very amazing addition. You get two of these mummies, as well as two of each&nbsp;accessory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Motorcycle</i>:</b> An old-fashioned motorcycle that is a great scarlet and black mix.Up front is some interesting headlights as well as gray markings on the front wheel protector piece. There is some nice black handle bars and up front with some elaborate details is a spot for Mac to sit. In the back you get a headlight and a place to keep a gray rifle and some great dynamite - my first dynamite as well. Very well detailed and a good size. While most 10 -13 dollar sets aren't much besides the Minifigures, this set has this great motorcycle which is&nbsp;recommended because of the collector's value. I really like this vehicle, and I normally don't care for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Desert Stand </b></i><b>-</b> This isn't really much. Down at the bottom is some nice detail with gray bricks that are supposed to be rocks, some amazing dark blue bricks. We move up to one of those 4x4 smooth pieces with a stud piece thing in the middle. This is dark blue. On both sides of it is a tan slope piece with some gold studs. I love the great colors in this set. You get a big golden staff with very elegant designs and two fang-liked things at the top to form an&nbsp;almost&nbsp;complete&nbsp;circle. Wonderful staff and my favorite part, besides the great Minifigs. You put this beautiful staff in that 4x4 smooth piece and it stands still. It is one of the six golden items that are in all these sets and that are what all the good guys are trying to get from the evil mummies. In the back is just a tall tan wall that is pointed and ends with a dark blue&nbsp;piece. There is this device that allows you to push the staff from is stand, by pushing a small stick into the staff. However, this device falls out as well.&nbsp;Nonetheless, the staff does fly forward very far which makes up for it. I guess this is the pint of the dynamite. You put the dynamite behind the wall and push the device to make it seem like the dynamite exploded, pushing the staff forward. A nice feature. There is also a small green plant protruding from the wall.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion:</b> Most ten dollar sets are only worth it for the Minifigs, but this has other stuff too. I would highly&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this set to Prince of Persia fans because of its setting in the desert, adventure-loving fans for this great playability, and fans of unique minifigs and pieces. Highly worth it and a great addition to the&nbsp;fabulous Pharaoh's Quest theme. Hopefully I'll do Scarab Attack soon. You should really just go and buy it. Now. Really. Go.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"legoDad42","2011-01-02T00:20:57.127Z","Great Pharaoh Starter...","<p><strong>Golden Staff Guardians</strong> is one of those perfect little $10.00 sets that have great mini-figs and accessories. </p>
<p>Great for kids for the excellent designs of the mini-figs, a vehicle&nbsp;and good playability for such a small scene (Lot's you can do with this set and some imagination) while for the AFoL, you get the mini-figs to increase your Mummy armies, excellent accessories and a cool looking motorcycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The breakdown....</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>motorcycle </strong>in a beautiful rich red (similar body and chassis like Mutt's 'Harley-esque' bike from Indiana Jones set 7196) w/double headlights, rear tail-light and clips in the rear for tools, weapons, etc. In this set, it holds a rifle and a stick of dynamite. <em>Suggestion, attach a gray pistol to bike to act as a kick stand. Helps stand up bike better when Mac McLoud is fighting off those Mummy Warriors.</em> 
<li>New <strong>Mac McLoud</strong> mini-fig with pilot's helmet, goggles (an extra pair included), bruise graphic and stubble on face, all new torso with wife beater t-shirt, suspenders and blood stain graphics front and back. No graphics on legs. 
<li>2 <strong>Mummy Warriors</strong> with the standard Pharaoh head-dress but this time the head-dress is all in black. Gives the Mummy Warriors a more menacing look and sets the tone as the main foot soldiers in the Mummy Army of the Undead! They are issued a khopesh 'sickle' sword and wonderfully designed scarab-shield each in dark pearl gray. 
<li>Small, mini diorama of a temple holding one of Pharaoh Amset Ra's precious/mystical artifacts, the <strong>Golden Staff</strong>. Nicely designed pearl gold staff with a spot at the top to attach possibly the Soul Diamond from Flying Mummy Attack (7307)?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability-wise...with the 'temple' you have a spot to put the staff on and a long pin to push the Golden Staff off it's base. This is to simulate McLoud planting his dynamite and blowing part of the wall, thus knocking off the staff. Plant the dynamite either in the front at the base of the staff or to the 'back' of the temple. Another idea for playability here is that as McLoud approaches the staff, you push the pin and the staff flies off into the hands of the Mummy Warriors acting as if they have telekinetic powers. Also build around the small temple to give it a larger look. There's much you can do with this small set!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I <strong><em>highly recommend</em></strong> getting this. Great price, great figs and great playability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note:On all the Pharaoh's Quest sets there are precious and perhaps mystical artifacts of Pharaoh Amset Ra for your heroes to liberate. This set has (as mentioned above) the Golden Staff but I was remiss to mention in a previous review </em><a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=37635"">http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=37635</a>&nbsp;<em>that the artifact there is called a Soul Diamond.</em></p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,4
"AETerry","2011-01-31T13:06:55.78Z","Golden Staff Guardians Review","<p>Here we are with the second of my Pharoah's Quest sets and the second smallest of them to get at $9.99. And that's not bad for the size of this set and the number of minifigures you get in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what you get is Mac McLeod on a motorcycle as he races towards the shrine area where the Golden Staff is hidden away at. His motorcycle has a bit of reduncancy with extra pieces that could have been left out in my opinion... 1 clear piece for the head light instead of going for two. And the back which seems to high up, but how else is the build going to support the inclusion of a back tail light and saddle pack to hold Mac's rifle and a stick of dynamite. The motorcycle really is sweet for it's coloring and the intention of design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You then have 2 Mummy Warriors guarding the Staff from Intruders and Treasure Hunters. The detailing of their legs, torsos and faces is great for minifigures. I just love their scarab shields and swords. It'd be sweet to get a battle pack of these Mummy Warriors in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, you have the little shrine set holding the Golden Staff.&nbsp; It's decent, about my only complaint is the little piece you flick out to make the Staff look like it's going flying. I could have done with out that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All together, the look, feel and play set up is great. On a roll and I'm gonna want to continue to pick up more of Pharoah's Quest as the year goes by.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"LegoAficionado","2011-01-09T11:09:01.75Z","Behold the Golden Staff of Ra...I mean of Amset-Ra!","I have been really excited about this theme ever since the first pictures of the sets appeared during the late summer. As anyone who has read my other reviews, I loved all of the adventurers sets from the late 90's to the early 2000's. So when I saw Pharaoh's Quest, I giggled with excitement and nostalgia. Pharaoh's Quest is the somewhat reboot of the Adventurers theme with the Desert subtheme.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>So I naturally wanted to pick up some of the themed sets when they came out but I did not really have much money to do so. But, when I finally had enough money, I went out to TRU and picked up both this set and the large Scorpion Pyramid (More on that in the next review).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This set is small compared to the other sets, but is it worth buying?</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigs:</b>&nbsp;Now this set comes with Mac McCloud and two mummy soldiers. Mac is a nice minifig and that is all I have to really say about him, he has nice detail and he is okay. The real minifig stars of this set are the two mummy soldiers. Both mummy soldiers carry awesome metallic grey scarab shields and swords. And each of the mummies has a nice black mummy headdress. the heads of the mummies have two faces and you can choose which face you want on each of them. The mummies are really nice and are much improved over the 1998 Adventurers mummies. These mummies actually look like what you would expect a mummy to look like and they have a lot of detail.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Minifigs: 5/5</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Motorcycle:</b>&nbsp;I am not sure if TLC made a new motorcycle mold for this set, but all I can say about it is, it's amazing. It has a really nice color of crimson red to it, and it has a very nice mold. Though building it is not all that extensive, it is nice to build a well designed bike.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Motorcycle: 4/5</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Staff Stand: </b>Now here we get into the actual feature of the set. The staff stand is much larger than what you would expect it to be, and has a build that is more complex than as you can see on the box. The stand has some really nice dessert pieces and it has a action feature. If you place the staff in the stand, in the back of the stand is a push rod that if used, launches the staff off from the stand. Though it is a very simple mechanic, it works really well, and with the dynamite included in the set, you can create a nice explosion scenario (just a suggestion :]) The stand is nicely built and offers some playability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Staff Stand: 4/5</div><div><br></div><div><b>Golden Treasure-Staff: </b>This is one of the 6 golden Pharaoh's treasures. The staff is by far my favorite because it is really well designed. The staff has a connector spot at the top of it, so you can place a jewel/ruby in it. The staff is much longer than what you expect and can be held quite nicely by any of the characters.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Golden Staff: 5/5</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall:</b>&nbsp;This set may lack in some complexity of the build, but makes up for it in the shear amount of imagination and playability it is capable of. You will have fun with this set, and the minifigs are a very nice addition to any collection (especially the mummies). The staff is amazing and it truly makes you feel like it is a legendary item. The motorcycle is simple but is very fun to play with and the staff stand has a well working feature to it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now about the price. In my opinion (and everyone else's these days) it is a bit overpriced. But not as overpriced as other sets I have had these past few years. I say that this set may seem too few on pieces, but it is somewhat worth the price. Now I say somewhat because I am not entirely convinced it is worth the price, but: if you like really good minifigs, buy it; if you really want to get a Pharaohs quest set that is smaller than most of the others, you might want to get this one or the set ""Flying mummy attack""; or if you want a good playable set, I suggest you at least consider this set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is a very good set and TLC did a really good job sticking true to the Adventurers theme for this reboot. I say, mission accomplished Lego, you have recaptured my heart with nostalgia, again...</div><div><br></div><div>Overall I give this set my stamp of approval and a 5/5.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Check out my next review...Scorpion Pyramid. Does it live up to its predecessor ""The temple of Anubis"" from 1998? We will discover the truth, haha...ha...(lame pun)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-15T12:29:21.403Z","Skeleton Mummies and a new Adventure in Egypt. What's not to Love?","<p>Set #7306 Golden Staff Guardians: I picked this set up when I bought 50$ worth of LEGO at TRU to get 10$ off, it was a deal TRU Canada had going on and I figured this would be a perfect start for the Pharaoh's Quest Theme... I wasn't wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having no knowledge of the backstory for the Theme prior to picking up the set I wasn't aware of who the Mini-Figure was by name, but now I know. His name is Mac McCloud, apparently he's teamed up with Jake Raines and a few other adventurous sorts to stop the evil Pharaoh Amset-Ra from claiming the six golden treasures and reeking terrible vengence upon the LEGO Universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The backstory isn't as important as what the set looks and feels like once you've got it built up, and I honestly really love this set, the only thing preventing me from giving it all fives is the size and number of pieces included. It is after all one of the cheapest sets, but is great fun and really impresive looking for such a small build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Golden Staff rests on an ancient pedestal, but with a simple flick of the piece sticking out of the back it falls off, simulating the explosion caused by the dynamite I suppose. If this set only featured the pedestal alone it wouldn't be much to look at, fortunately LEGO thought to include a familiar, yet not so familiar looking Motorcycle. Seeing as how I missed the Chauchill Cemetary Battle set this was my first exposure to this particular style of Motorcycle. And I LOVE IT COMPLETELY!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Motorcylce looks great, it has the feel of a 1950's era Motorcycle and, when put next to my Scorpion Tracker from Adventurers it looks perfect. The two Themes, seperated by at least a decade compliment each other quite nicely. The Skeleton Mummies come with some great looking torso and head prints, as well as some nifty looking accessories, the scarab shield and the sword they use is just... I don't know how to describe it... But I wish I had the Roman Gladiator from the Collectible Mini-Figures so I could have him facing off against these two, I'm sure it would look quite fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Skeleton Mummies have double-sided heads, so you can mix and match the look of them. Or have them share the same face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd strongly recommend these new Pharoh's Quest sets, I can't wait to pick up the other five, even if they do have Chinese made Mini-Figures... Though I don't think they do, I mean this set doesn't seem to have them. In fact I can't wait until I can pick up a duplicate of this set for those Skeleton Mummies and another Motorcylce, the set really impressed me and I think you'll be impressed too. The only problem is I don't think Amset-Ra can actually wield all six of his golden treasures, not unless LEGO made him with a larger than normal Mini-Figure body that could accomodate six arms. The staff is a great looking piece though, and it has a socket where the Soul Gem is to be placed from Flying Mummy Attack. I look forward to picking that one up and combining the two treasures of the Pharoh to begin either saving LEGO Universe or plunging it into a Pharaoh's evil Curse.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"wander099","2011-02-08T08:15:03.537Z","Nice Motorcycle","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is fairly small and designed like all the other ones in Pharaoh's Quest.&nbsp; The instruction booklet is short and simple.&nbsp; It is easy to follow and given the number of pieces this set contains, mistakes are unlikely to occur.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The only special parts in this set are the pieces that compose the motorcycle body and the golden staff itself (which according to the story is required to defeat the Pharaoh...I think).&nbsp; It also comes with a bundle of dynamite.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are three minifigures: two mummy warriors and Mac McCloud.&nbsp; The two mummy warriors come with a scarab shield and a scimitar each.&nbsp; They also have two faces, one with only an eye showing and the other with both eyes and the mouth showing.&nbsp; McCloud resembles a mechanic and is wearing an aviator hat with goggles, which I think would have looked better in black than the grey that they are.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very simplistic.&nbsp; The motorcycle is largely composes of two large pieces and the shrine is a very straightforward build.&nbsp; A young child would likely be capable of building this without assistance.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The motorcycle is the most impressive part of this set.&nbsp; It is coloured in an aesthetically pleasing dark red, has a decent design for the intended time period and while it is a little unstable, if you have an extra hinge control stick or two, you can create a kickstand on one or both sides.&nbsp; The motorcycle can be rolled along, but if you push it and let go, it will probably fall down.<br></p><p>As for the shrine, it is unimpressive.&nbsp; It holds the golden staff which can be knocked off by pushing the pin on the back, but is important not to push very hard or the staff will be knocked a significant distance.&nbsp; This is the only function of this part of the set.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a good set if you have some of the larger Pharaoh's Quest sets as it will go very well with them and its playability will be enhanced.&nbsp; It is also a good set to get if you want to get more mummy warriors of if you are interested in the motorcycle, as the price is fairly low.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,4
"K_nut","2011-02-26T17:46:56.15Z","A surprisingly good set.","<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>When I first saw the Pharaohs Quest line in stores I picked up the two smallest sets. My big reason for buying this set was for the minifigs and motorcycle. Really, these aren't the only good things about this set.</p>
<h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Minifigs</h4>
<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The minifigs are a great part of this set and get a 5/5 from me. Mac McCloud has a great face and torso with&nbsp;an oil stain. All the detail in these figs are just stunning. The sword, (Khopesh, as I believe it is called), is a beautiful piece and I will certainly buy some off of Bricklink if possible.</p>
<h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Motorcycle</h4>
<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This set is a very nice, cheap way of getting a beautiful motorcycle, even&nbsp;if it is the same mold from 7196. Equipped with Dynamite, this thing is ready to kick some undead butt!</p>
<h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Shrine</h4>
<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The shrine that holds the golden staff is bigger then you would expect. The golden staff itself is a very nice piece and is great for making some very cool wizards. The shrine itself is full of useful parts and even has a play mechanism for removing the staff.</p>
<h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Overall</h4>
<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>7306 is a great parts pack and army builder at the same time. This set has a very good building experience for a smaller set and has good playability. What more can you want than some undead warriors against an adventurer equipped with a rifle and Dynamite. Even if you're not a fan of Egyptian adventures, This is a great set that you should&nbsp;definitely buy.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1. It's an amazing set despite its small.<br></li><li>Pro 2. It has weapons like a shotgun and dynamite.</li><li>Pro 3. It has a nice motorbike and many details like the golden staff.</li><li>Pro 4. If you collect monster minifigures, the two mummies can add up to your collection. <br></li><li>Pro 5. You can add this set to the previous themes like Adventures Egypt and Indiana Jones.<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1. The headress of the mummies could have been gold with blue lines like the one&nbsp; the Pharaoh from Series 2 has.<br></li><li>Con 2. It would have been better if there was another mummy that could be either the snake charmer of a flying mummy.</li></ul><br>I find this set nice. I always wanted to get a treasure artifact from Lego. Also, I was planning to make Legends of the Hidden Temple in Lego so I needed at least one artifact. With the mummies in this set, I can make the crypt room based on the show. I suggest you get this set.<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

"Harmonious_Building","2012-07-21T20:30:24.89Z","The mummies return.","In the late nineties, LEGO experimented with a subtheme called the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Adventurers&amp;subtheme=Desert"">Adventurers</a>, rolling out a line of sets based on the 1920s fascination with ancient Egypt, or at least a stereotypical representation of it. Compared to many of the others themes that had been released up until that point, Adventurers tested the waters by doing things a little differently: the ""protagonists"" of the set had official names, and there was a loose storyline and character relations that sort of tied all of them together. Apparently it was successful enough that the Adventurers earned themselves a couple of neat subthemes, but those came out at the time when I had fallen off the LEGO wagon, so I can't say too much more about them.<div><br></div><div>Anyway, the much more recent Pharaoh's Quest is clearly a homage/reboot of that old Adventurers line, and there are some striking similarities here between this theme and the Desert subtheme of the Adventurers, though of course everything is much shinier and more up-to-date. So, it's kind of nice that LEGO decided to essentially give a modern audience a reintroduction to a theme that was unique when it first came out.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Golden Staff Guardians itself is a pretty simple set - so simple, in fact, that it's almost like a ""battle pack"" than an actual set. For US$10, you get a gun-toting, motorcyle-riding, dynamite-wielding (?) explorer, a pair of cool undead mummies with an ancient thirst for vengeance, a sweet motorcycle, and a shrine of sorts that houses the titular Golden Staff, whose mysterious purpose is unknown to me. It's not a bad deal, and the generous selection of Minifigs alone make this set a pretty good deal, especially if you can find it on sale.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Minifigs are all nicely detailed, as one should expect of all contemporary Minifigs. Our explorer's rough and stubbled face realistically convey that idea that he's spent a good amount of time cavorting about in the desert, and he comes with a rifle that I believe hails back from at least the time of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Western"">Western</a> subtheme and possibly earlier. His motorcycle is not much of a ""build"" per se, but it does come in the relatively rare dark red colour, which I do like. There's plenty of room at the back to hold his accessories and for a passenger to teeter precariously if you so desire.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The mummies are likewise very awesome. I like the new scimitar weapons that they have, and I absolutely love the ""scarab"" shields, which are of dubious historical authenticity but give these undead warriors a lot of personality. Their heads are printed on both sides, so you can swap them around to give the two a little bit more variety, which is welcome. These two goons are protecting the aforementioned shrine to the Golden Staff, which is ostensibly the main build here but, again, it's not exactly spectacular or particularly complicated. It looks good for what it's trying to show, and it does have this strange gimmick in which one can push a little Technic pin behind to knock the Golden Staff over. Why is this important when the Golden Staff is already very easily removed? Who knows. But, it exists and doesn't hurt anyone, so whatever.</div><div><br></div><div>If you're looking to spice up your Minifig collection with a 1920s adventurer guy and a couple of sweet mummies, this is a great set to pick up just for the heck of it. You get a lot of highly playable odds and ends, so you're unlikely to be disappointed, since what you see is pretty much what you get. It's generally pretty rare that the smallest sets of any theme feel like a complete package, but this plus Scarab Attack (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7305-1"">7305</a>) are actually good enough for a little adventure (and they are also incidentally the only Pharaoh's Quest sets that I have). And who knows? If you develop a taste for antics in the Egyptian desert, perhaps you'll feel compelled to empty your own royal treasury and get the rest of the line for yourself.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,3,2,5,5

<p>the&nbsp; minifigs are AMAZING! i love the accesories (especially the golden staff) and the motorcycle was a great addition to my lego collection&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>the mummies are great except for one thing. their heads are two sided which means you have to have the headresses on them. mac is cool with the muscles and the stains on his shirt. i like the avaitor's helmet as well&nbsp;</p>

<p>the build was boring and easy.</p>

A very nice set which includes the first trophy of the Quest : the Pharaoh&#39;s Golden Staff attached to a small shrine and guarded by 2 Mummy&#39;s. It offers great playability, mini figures and parts and is still very affordable.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Building 3 bricks :</strong> An average reward here simply because there is not too much to built besides the motorcycle and the small shrine holding the Golden Staff. Fun to do but finished in just a few minutes.</font></p>
