"Niallskie","2010-11-23T15:29:51.687Z","Who needs flying mummies??? Us","<p>I bought this set at the local Lego store for $20bucks, perfect price for the set if you ask me. Did not bought the 7327 (Pyramid of the Pharoah) for a couple of reasons... main reason though is that Black Friday is coming and the Lego store gives the scratch a discount on that day, I might get 10%, 20% and 50% discount on your purchase, now who wouldn't want that right? Hopefully this info also helps in your buying decision this week?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the review then, when I was on my way home I checked the box and the plane&nbsp;on this set reminded me of the plane in 7623 for the Indiana Jones set. I said to myself I do hope they are not same in built as I can already see similarities in the picture. Got home, opened the set and started building... awesome. I love this set, ofcourse there are mummies, but the highlight&nbsp;are the accessories they come with. Head piece is fantastic I tell you,&nbsp;but the attachable wings hit the mark for me. I did not like the plastic wings they do before specially when the get scuffed, bent, streatch and ripped. This wings are solid plastic, that gives the playability of the minifigures alone are endless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pagoda, totem or what ever you call it is the usual build, nothing special about it really. As usual the sticker does not work well for me, as I would prefer printed bricks. Now the plane... is it worth the purchase? Well it is worth every penny, I was afraid it woudl be&nbsp;the same build as a previous Indi plane... in some ways they are, but in a lot of ways different. I actually loved the plane, color is fantastic but the thing I love the most is the dual mounted machine gun (humbly built but looks devastating), and the gem grabber at the belly of the plane, simplistically genious is the way i can describe it. Played with this plane for a couple of minutes before I set it down to display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all this set is fantastic addition to the whole Pharoah's Quest line, I basically advice you to buy it and experience the fun for yourself. Would be nice if there are more minifigures (don't we all want the same? :D). Another thing I did not like much is the grabbable gem, I mean it serves its purpose in playability, but it has a big tendency to be lost. Other than that love this set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Zrath","2010-11-25T06:50:23.373Z","Flying Mummy Attack!","The Pharoah's Quest sets have been showing up in US Toys'R'Us stores, and my local one had three of the sets, including this one.<br>The actual name of the set, as printed on the box, is ""Flying Mummy Attack"" and it costs $20 USD. The box is a new square and very flat size also used for the new Atlantis 7978 ""Angler Fish Attack"" set which also sells for $20 USD. (I sense a theme)<br>&nbsp;<br>Most people will get this set because of said flying mummies, and they are very nice.<br>The wings are wide and solid, with beautiful dark blue and tan detailing. The neck-tab seems pretty sturdy. The wings are styled after the scarab wings seen in ancient Egyptian architecture and hieroglyphics (and on Journey album covers).<br>The flying mummies wear Horus-style falcon headdresses and they're awesome!<br>The minifigs have printed torso and legs, and two different faces on the head.<br>&nbsp;<br>The biplane is nifty and follow many of the design aspects of actual WWI aircraft. The rounded wing-tips and tail-tips, the twin machine guns on top of the upper wing. It's got a major design flaw though: the propeller is simply TOO DARN BIG!<br>The propeller looks massive when compared to the size of the actual plane, and it hits the ground when the plane's body is parallel to the ground (during take-offs and landings). I don't know why Lego didn't go with a smaller prop. I've already replaced the one on mine. :)<br>Also, this is yet another Lego tail-dragger airplane without a tail-wheel or a tail-skid. They did the same thing with the Indiana Jones ""Fighter Plane Attack"" set. Indy's stolen biplane and the pursuing German fighter both lacked tail-wheels.<br>The biplane is equipped with a grabber mounted on a swing-arm with which to snag the jewel at the top of the obelisk. This is a neat little play feature.<br>&nbsp;<br>Overall, this is a cool set. The flying mummy figs are the highlight, followed by the nice dark red biplane.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"legoDad42","2010-12-26T18:23:09.863Z","Fun, Flyin' Pharoah's Quest...!","<p>The return of the 'Adventurers' styled theme...Pharoah's Quest, Flying Mummy Attack is a fun small to mid-sized set that has a wonderful dark, deep red bi-plane and great, all new mini-figs...The Flying Mummy's!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PRO's...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>'Spirit of Luis' Bi-Plane</strong>. A beautiful deep red, single cockpit biplane(with small lever), rubber wheeled landing gear (left and right), plus Spirit of Luis graphic (on sides),&nbsp;eagle-headed graphic (on tail)&nbsp;and RAF Roundel designs (left and right) on top wing (all stickered graphics). 
<li>2 large machine guns atop the two main wings (these are the automatic long barrel pistols with technic pins to complete the look). 
<li>Hook/Grappling technic arm under bottom wing that swings left and right and can hook/grab. Used to grab the gem stone atop the obelisk but can also grab other items. 
<li>7-inch tall obelisk with wonderfully detail hierolglyphs (nice weathered look to them)&nbsp;and turqoise trans-colored gem (on a modified 2x2 plate) atop. This is&nbsp;the gem you can grab with the hook arm. 
<li><strong>Jake Raines</strong> Mini-Fig with brown aviator helmet and dark gray goggles (you also get an extra pair), brown aviator jacket graphics front and back. Front has an 'S' pin/badge and silver flying wing details, back of jacket has an eagle design (which matches the graphic stickered ones on the biplane itself) and initials 'SMH' (not sure what SMH stands for). Jake's face graphics has long sideburns, stubble and he appears to have a scar on his left cheek (and I don't mean his bum...;) 
<li><strong>Flying Mummy Mini-Figs.&nbsp;</strong>You get 2 great,&nbsp;all new figures with newly molded and beautifully painted detailed wings (long single piece that you attach to neck of mini-fig). Great new 'Horus' head helmet w/Horus eye (wedjat) graphics. New mummy wrap graphics front and back of torso and duel faced head. One side head shows both red eyes and teeth while the duel side has only a single eye peeking out through the wrappings. Also front legs have graphics and both of these figs. comes with pearl, dark gray spears.</li></ul>
<p><strong>CON's...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although I love the color and details on the biplane it's a bit too small. Should've made the two front wings mounted taller (Jake can't see at all through this), and make the plane a little longer too (for overall look and to possibly accomdate some storage). 
<li>No tail/back wheel. 
<li>No hand held weapon for Jake. I guess he can grab one of the machine guns from the top wing. 
<li>Price. For 125+ pieces $20.00 is a tad too high. I'm thinking this is more of a $15.00 (tops) kit but I'm guessing the price is for the newly molded helmets and wings for the Mummy's. It's not a terrible price though.</li></ul>
<p>This set fills the niche left by the Indiana Jones theme and brings back the feel of good old Johnny Thunder. Cool new looking biplane (excellent color), GREAT new Mummy minifigs and overall...if you're looking for high adventure and high playability...this is a must get! I recommend it. </p>
<p>Great fun for the kids. Easy and fun build for them and they (along with AFOL's) will love the mini-figs. Love to see how builders incorporate the new winged elements into their Moc's.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,3
"Be_Burger","2010-12-26T07:37:36.037Z","Swooshable: Check","I picked this set up a few weeks ago, and got around to building it yesterday. Here are my thoughts on this set.<br><br>First off, the box packaging is very nice but does not really affect the set itself. When you open the box you will find a small instructions booklet, the dreaded sticker sheet, a small bag, a medium bag, and a large bag of parts. I was definitely suprised how few pieces there really were in this set.<br><br>The build is very easy but is satisfying, the dark red color of the biplane and the tan &amp; dark blue of the pillar contrast very nicely. The pillar is lacking in much of a build or such though.<br><br>The fun little feature of this is the jewel grabber, believe it or not it really works! There is a little claw arm on the bottom of the airplane which easily grabs the jewel on a plate and carries it away. Mucho fun.<br><br>The figures are fantastic! From the details on our brave hero's torso, to the wings of the undead mummies, it is a great set figurewise. The mummies are quite awesome, you have to admit.<br><br>Overall, I feel that the main part of this are the figures and the biplane, which are very nice, while the pillar is quite lacking.<br><br>To finish up, here are my pros and cons:<br>PROs:<br><ul><li>Flying mummy figures</li><li>Nice dark red biplane</li><li>Cool pilot/hero minifig</li></ul><br>CONs:<br><ul><li>Pillar lacking build or details</li><li>Not very many pieces for a $20 set</li></ul>Thanks for reading my review!

"legomakes3","2011-02-08T17:42:28.6Z","Simply One of the Best Sets of 2011!","<p>For my birthday, I decided to purchase numerous new City sets and 4 of the brand new Pharaoh's Quest set. Being a fan of the original Adventurers series, and remembering the cheezy commericals they had in 2000, I decided to give these re-vamped sets an ultimate try. The set that literally caught my attention was this one. Not only does the plane look like something coming out of WWI, it is also a very well designed and done set. In other words, it is just one of the BEST LEGOs of 2011! And here's why...
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>…</p>
The box is pretty skinny, due to LEGO's helping-our-beautiful-environment program. It definitley looks like a $19.99 set (I only got it for $15.99 because I took GREAT advantage of TRU's 20% sale! CHA-CHING!), and it shows vividly what the set really is about: a great duel in the air! The instructions are just normal instructions, with an illustration of the whole series on the back, and the regular screaming kid contest on the back! 
<h4>Parts</h4><p>…</p>
The parts work well with the type of set you are building. LEGO did a good job making sure all the necessary parts to make a warplane in this style was included, and also gave it a pretty good mix of colors. The only pet-peve I have about this set is the piece assortment for the crystal tower. Honestly, its too skinny for my ultimate liking, but I still give it points...
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>…</p>
This is probably the OUTSTANDING part of the set! Jake Raines in an RAF-style aviator jacket and those two amazingly-designed flying mummies! I don't even CARE that the mummy itself is a re-hash, the helmets and wings make up for that! BRAVO, LEGO, BRAVO!
<h4>The build</h4><p>…</p>
A simple 10-20 minute build, with excitment building up when the plane starts to literally come together!
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>…</p>
When the model is completed, it is a work of a true genius! I mean, everything in it just WORKS! The plane is awesome, the statue is great, and the mechanisim of picking up the diamond is really cool, too! I think people should actually get MORE THAN ONE of these sets, because you can definitley make your own LEGO WWI stop-motion film or army with the plane!
<h4>Summary</h4><p>…</p>
If I was asked how much I liked this set in a rating between 1 and 10, I would have to break the rules a tad bit and give it a....um, let's see.........TRILLION! Everything about this set screams me! It was an instant choice to add to my large collection of LEGO, and is probably my favorite Pharaoh's Quest set! THANK YOU LEGO!",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"HeroFactoryDude316","2010-12-31T14:36:48.38Z","What's better than one flying mummy... two flying mummies!","This is an awesome set! I got it for Christmas along with a few other Pharaoh's Quest sets. This set is probably my second favorite the first being the cobra and the least favorite is the scarab. Now on with the review. <br><br>Minifigures: Jake Raines: Jake is an okay minifig. In this set he comes with goggles and is in a flight suit. He's pretty good because unlike other sets he wears something different. The only thing is Jake comes in way too many sets. 4/5<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mummies(flying): These guys are great. The wings on them are amazing. Another thing is their helmets. There shaped like the heads of hawks so that's cool. I also like the double sided heads.5/5<br><br>Plane: The plane is great. I love the deep red color. The other great thing is the claw to pick up the gem. The machine guns are good but Jake can't see where he's going with them in the way. The propeller is good also but that blocks Jake too. 5/5<br><br>Tower: The tower is terrific. I like the Egyptian writing even though it's stickers. The gold pieces are great and those plants are good but it'd be better if they were gray. Another thing is that the crystal is just sitting on top. I've lost it twice because of that already. 4/5<br><br>Overall this is a good set and goes well with the Scarab attack. 5/5 <br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"AETerry","2011-05-18T15:48:43.353Z","Flying Mummy Attack Review","<p>So the Pharaoh's Quest is on my list of themes for this year that I'm working on picking up. This set is the latest on my list picked up. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What caught my attention with this set are the two Flying Mummies. Those two minifigures look very cool with the Falcon style head dresses and wings expanding out from behind them along with the detail work for the mummies' faces, legs and torsos. I'd have hoped for just one more with this set. But with the wings being new pieces, a part of me is aware that specialty pieces or large pieces do factor into the value of a set or how many of a particular piece will show up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other notable, which I didn't really pay attention too until I'd opened the box and put it together is the bi-plane. Jake Raines pilots stalwart plane named the Spirit of Luis. While a good little plane, I do complain of a design flaw of the two tommyguns used for mounted machines guns being too low and that they'd tear up the propeler if it really were to function as is. The plane is also equiped with a ""catch"" that comes down to scoop up the gemstone off the top of the obelisk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last piece or feature to this set is the obelisk that the gemstone sits on top of. It, along with the bi-plane both have stickers that feature on it. So love 'em or hate 'em, they're here. While the obelisk is certainly tall enough to warrant the use of a bi-plane to come in and retrieve the gemstone, I can't help but feel there could have been more to it. Like maybe just a bit more grand looking. It just feels like it lacks something. Perhaps this is where my feelings come in of wanting a third flying mummy figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all, it's a fairly decent set and worth it at $19.99 for the Mummies and Bi-Plane build, with all else being extras. I've been enjoying displaying it on my desk.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"wander099","2011-01-12T22:57:41.533Z","A Decent Set","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is well done, you get a nice close up view of the plane and the flying mummy minifigures.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Something I especially liked was that two machine guns are included as part of the guns on the plane.&nbsp; In addition to looking good on the plane itself, they can be removed and used with minifigures.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The flying mummies are great.&nbsp; They are really detailed and the wings are made of good sturdy plastic.&nbsp; You also get Jake Raines wearing an aviator helmet and jacket.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was not challenging in itself, with the exception of the stickers.&nbsp; The stickers are my major complaint with this set.&nbsp; In particular, the sticker for the tail of the plane was difficult to attach and took multiple attempts.&nbsp; There are also stickers for the writing on the side of the plane, the bull's eyes on the tops of the wings, and of course the Hieroglyphics on the pillar are also stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The pillar is nothing special, but the design is good.&nbsp; The plane is the real draw for this set.&nbsp; The design itself is great, but could be improved if the pilot's seat was higher so that Raines could see over the top.&nbsp; But the red colour is nice and, as I mentioned before, the machine guns are great.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would recommend this to anyone who likes the Pharaoh's Quest theme or likes planes.&nbsp; The plane in this set does not resemble any plane that I have seen in LEGO before and the set goes well with other Egyptian style sets, including the old Adventurers theme sets.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4

"Zackula","2011-04-28T20:50:28.02Z","Best set of Pharaoh's Quest","<p>I bought this set at Target in the U.S. a few months ago and love it.&nbsp; It consists of a biplane, an obelisk, and three minifigures.&nbsp; It is like someone at LEGO said, ""Hm, let's make a set with a really cool airplane, but lets add an obelisk and make it all in rare and beautiful colors.&nbsp; While we're at it, lets add in an epic flying mummy.&nbsp; No, scratch that, make it two flying mummies.""<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Box:<br></p><p>The box is one of the newer thin boxes, which I like because of less cardboard in landfills/ my closet.&nbsp; The front shows Jake Raines flying the plane toward the obelisk to steal the diamond like a boss while the flying mummies are attacking him.&nbsp; The back shows him landing the plane to steal the diamond.&nbsp; There is also a diagram of the six Pharaoh's treasures, with everything but the diamond greyed out.&nbsp; There is also a diagram showing how the grabbing mechanism works.&nbsp; The top side shows the three minifigures, plus the diamond.&nbsp; There is nothing really important on the other sides, just choking warnings and LEGO Club stuff.&nbsp; <br></p><p>Instructions:<br></p><p>The instructions are on the smaller size, about the same as an average BIONICLE canister set.&nbsp; They didn't have protective cardboard or shrink wrap.&nbsp; The cover of the instructions shows the same picture as the back of the box.&nbsp; It has the minifigures first, then the obelisk, and finally the plane.&nbsp; The last few pages have the grabbing mechanism, parts inventory, a list of all the Pharaoh's Quest sets, and the standard LEGO Club/survey advertisement.&nbsp; These were on the last five pages, not the same page.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set is excellent for parts.&nbsp; About half of the biplane is brick red.&nbsp; This includes six of the 3x3 quarter circle plates.&nbsp; It also includes a few gold, dark tan, and dark blue pieces in the obelisk, as well as two cylinder plants.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are a few stickers, including two for hieroglyphics, two for the name of the plane, two for the bulls-eyes, and two for the rudder.&nbsp; These stickers are the only reason it didn't get a five for parts. &nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This is it, the reason the set caught your eye in the first place: flying mummies.&nbsp; These are definitely in the list of Ten Coolest Minifigures of All Time.&nbsp; I'll review them piece by piece.</p><p>Legs:</p><p>The legs are light grey with dark blue Egyptian bandages/robes/cloaks/kilts printed on them.&nbsp; They are not printed in the back or the sides.&nbsp; They have a gold belt with dark blue squares on the hips.&nbsp; This isn't on the sides or back either.</p><p>Torso:</p><p>The torso is light grey with mummy bandages printed on the front and back.&nbsp; On the front, it has the fancy Egyptian burial necklace printed in gold.&nbsp; There is no printing on the arms.</p><p>Head:</p><p>The head is also light grey.&nbsp; It is double sided, with with mummy wrappings on both sides.&nbsp; One side only shows one eye, while the other side shows both red eyes and some teeth.&nbsp; It is a very cool head, and can allow both the mummies to have different expressions.</p><p>Helmet:&nbsp; <br></p><p>The helmet is dark blue.&nbsp; It is molded in the shape of a hawk's head.&nbsp; The ancient Egyptian god, Horace, also has a hawk's head.&nbsp; It has the Egyptian eye symbol printed on a white background on both sides of the head.&nbsp; This piece came wrapped in a small, plastic, non-resealable bag.&nbsp; It is very cool and has a weighty feel to it.</p><p>Wings:</p><p>The wings are beautifully made.&nbsp; They are a combination of tan and dark blue plastic, with an Egyptian pattern printed on them.&nbsp; They are a hard plastic, like the rest of the minifigure.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the coolest neck pieces I have ever seen, and really make the mummies stand out.</p><p>Jake Raines:</p><p>Jake is the good guy in this set.&nbsp; In any other set, he would probably stand out, but here he is overshadowed by the mummies.&nbsp; He comes with a bomber jacket and a pilot's helmet.&nbsp; Overall, he is actually pretty cool.&nbsp; The mummies are just cooler.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This was a rather simple build.&nbsp; Building it as slow as I could, it took about twenty minutes.&nbsp; The only difficult part was getting the stickers to be symmetrical, since they were all in pairs.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This model is fun to play with and look at.&nbsp; The grabber mechanism is quite simple, but still fun.&nbsp; It consists of a torch holder on a Technic bar swinging down to grab the diamond.&nbsp; It seems like a rip off that this set got a common turquoise gem for its treasure, while the other sets got gold shields or swords, but the grabber wouldn't work on them. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This set is definitely worth the twenty bucks.&nbsp; I highly recommend this set to anyone who needs the parts, the minifigures, or just a cool set to play with.&nbsp; This is unique in its appeal to both AFOLs and kids alike.&nbsp; The only flaw in this set is the stickers.&nbsp; Otherwise, it would be the perfect set.&nbsp; I give this a 24/25<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Duq","2011-07-18T18:57:29.237Z","It's the Spirit of Luis, but where's the spirit of Johnny Thunder?","<p>I was happy to find this set on offer in the supermarket. I liked the old Adventurers series and this appears to be a similar theme. As well as that I have a weak spot for biplanes, so what could go wrong?<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is very well designed; the style of the box makes it obvious what sort of set this is. There's not much to say about the instructions for a small set like this; easy to follow.<br></p>
<h4>Parts &amp; Minifigures</h4><p>There's a lot of nice parts in this set. The main attraction are all the dark red pieces but there are also plant pieces, two cool tommy-guns and some pearl gold. There are three minifigs; a pilot and two winged mummies.</p><p>The retail price of this set in Ireland is €17,99. With only 125 parts that means 14c per piece and that's a lot for a theme without a license. That's possibly caused by the mummies with double-printed heads, big headgear and those wings.</p><p>There are no printed pieces in this set but there are some stickers; two on the tower, one on each side of the tail fin, one on each side of the plane with the 'Spirit of Luis' name and two round ones with the Royal Air Force insignia to put on the wings.<br></p>

<h4>The build</h4><p>The tower takes a minute or two to stack together. The colours are nice but it really is just a stack of bricks. The plane takes a little longer to build. No strange techniques involved, just good old stacking of bricks and plates. There's a plate with door rail inside to stop you pushing the propellor axle in too far. The result is a fairly wobbly propellor, but at least it spins freely.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I bought this set for the plane but unfortunately it's a disappointing design. I like the colour scheme, and the 'Spirit of Luis' is a nice touch (look up Spirit of St. Louis if you don't know what it refers to).</p><p>The pilot has a little windscreen but it's not clear why because any view forward is blocked by the upper wing assembly and the guns. Let's hope the guns are fitted with Fokkers synchroniser gear to stop them shooting the planes propellor to splinters...</p><p>The propellor spins freely when the plane is sitting with its tail on the ground, but once the tail lift for take-off the propellor hits the ground. The plane could also do with a tail wheel for taxi-ing.</p><p>There's a contraption underneath the plane that's designed to grab the jewel from the top of the tower. It's a nice trick for playability and it's easily removed if you don't need it.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I guess I don't really get the new theme. Why does every theme need bad guys these days? I preferred the old Adventurer theme that was just about archeologists looking for treasures. Without the winged mummies maybe there would have been some budget for a slightly better plane.</p><p>The set contains some interesting parts and the plane has some nice touches. On the other side of the equasion there are too many design flaws and the set is expensive for what you get. <br></p><p>Overall I was disappointed. Bring back Johnny Thunder!<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,2
"dragon_teenager","2011-08-16T14:52:11.83Z","Fantastic theme sampler","I got this set some time ago, but I've kept it completely intact because of how much fun it is to play with. You get a nifty biplane (that harkens back to the Adventurers themes of old) with updated aesthetics, and in my opinion this is one of LEGO's best attempts at the vehicle. A unique dark red color scheme, minimal stickers and a sleek look make it very swooshable. The dual machine guns mounted on the top of the plane also look quite nice. <br><br>The plane does come with some sort of robotic arm that is mounted near the landing gear, which might seem like a rather strange addition. The idea is that the biplane can swoop down and grab the gem on top of the Egyptian tower. As far as functionality goes, this is bare bones. Fortunately, the mechanical arm is very easy to remove and doesn't affect the overall look of the biplane. <br><br>The tower I mentioned is simple but effective, with some sparse vegetation and interesting colors. Unfortunately, the hieroglyphics are stickers, and without them it looks quite bland. I have never been as voraciously opposed to stickers as some people seem to be, but I imagine that this could bother some people. <br><br>The set includes three minifigures: a pilot, and two identical flying mummies. The pilot is nice, but relatively uninteresting; the mummies are much cooler and probably the best reason to pick up this set. The spread-eagle wings, complimented with a hawk-like headpiece, look gorgeous and even elegant. The mummy figures themselves look decent, and include reversible heads to add a little variety to their appearance (one side has a typical mummy grin, while the other side is fully bandaged aside from one eye - very cool). <br><br>In conclusion, this set is definitely worth looking at if you've ever been interested in Pharaoh's Quest. It's much cheaper than the Pyramid, which is the only set in this line that I think is significantly better. At $20, it's a pretty good value, and I enjoyed it immensely. Highly recommended! <br>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
"bricklord","2013-01-02T15:18:49.603Z","An Arial Battle in Brick","<p>There is much to like about this set. &nbsp;After building it twice now, I find myself still enjoying it.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The Instruction book is pretty standard. &nbsp;It is the newer format where each step has a parts list with it. &nbsp;Although, the steps are simplistic, sometimes only involving a single piece at a time.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>There isn't much to talk about here. &nbsp;The maroon pieces are nice, but they are only the bigger pieces for the plane. &nbsp;The piece count is low due to the use of extra tall spacer pieces and bigger plates.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>What can I say? &nbsp;The Flying Mummies are cool and you get two of them. &nbsp;The Pilot figure is fairly pedestrian for the theme.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The Pedestal for the ""Soul Diamond"" is rather uninteresting. &nbsp;The height is achieved through the use of extra tall spacer pieces. &nbsp;Due to the thinness of the spire, it falls apart pretty easily. &nbsp;The ""Soul Diamond"" is merely attached to a single plate, which is in turn not attached to anything, allowing for easy removal/loss.</p><p>The Biplane is a quick build without a lot of complications. &nbsp;The propeller is attached through the engine piece. &nbsp;The guns on the upper wing are nice, but the technic pieces used for the gun barrels can fall off if not firmly attached. &nbsp;The only thing really throwing the build off is the hook used for grabbing the ""Soul Diamond."" &nbsp;It just throws off the lines of the plane and hangs under the wing as an afterthought.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>There is much playability here. &nbsp;The Birplane is very swoosh-able, as are the Flying Mummies. &nbsp;I foresee many arial dogfights.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the stickers are on, the whole set has a very nice aesthetic to it.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The Flying Mummies, the Biplane, the color scheme, the minimal use of stickers, everything fits together very nicely for the ""Pharaoh's Quest"" theme. &nbsp;I would recommend this set on the strength of Flying Mummies alone.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-25T07:46:54.56Z","LEGO Pharaoh's Quest - Flying Mummy Attack Review","<p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of good pieces which are always great to have for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or brickfilms for sure. This is also the first time I've seen a set with the wing pieces which LEGO used for the mummies.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs are very nice. Jake Raines has a nice pilot uniform with a brown helmet and a brown jacket which is printed on the back. The mummies have a new hood piece and a nice wing piece which came in an own bag. I really like the printings of these flying mummies. They also got a printing on the back of the face and on the torso.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers with this set.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/7307-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has some really good value. We get a nice biplane which has a propeller on the front which sviwels full 360°. On the top of the wings we can see two tommy guns. That means that this is also my first set I got which comes with a tommy gun. The dark red pieces on this plane look very good as well. If you put it next to the biplane from the Adventurers theme (set: 5928) and next to the one from the Orient Expedition (set: 7417) you'll notice that this vehicle is a little bit smaller than the older ones which was really interesting. The next part we get is the obelisk. The obelisk has some foliage on the ground and on the top you can see a piece which has a gemstone which the explorer has to get if you move the little arm on the ground of the biplane. I really can't complain about this set.<br></span></p>

"clundsberg","2011-05-28T00:49:43.45Z","The set did a 180 on me.","<p>I try to purchase at least one set from each series Lego does.&nbsp; This does not always happen and for some reason I was very reluctant to get into this particular series even though I was crazy about the first wave of Adventurers which parallels this series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What changed my mind? Target.&nbsp; They had a sale.&nbsp; This set was knocked down to $15 and sold out (ergo how I ended up with the substitute Outpost Attack) at one Target but pretty well stocked at the other.&nbsp; Plus I'm a pretty big fan of Lego Bi-Planes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set did a 180 on me however and surprised me.&nbsp; Despite being excited about the plane and ho-hum regarding the notion of flying mummies, the pendulumn swung hard opposite direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plane is still a nice addition and the engine detail is sweet.&nbsp; However, I found it to be smaller than expected.&nbsp; The wingspan is shorter than most of my airplanes and the propellor seems clunky and oversized by comparison.&nbsp; This is about the extent of any negativity I have towards this set.&nbsp; If you cannot stand stickers, add that bias here as the plane itself has 6 (although the British insignias work well) and the Egyptian pillar has two...ok I'll give you this sticker gripe:&nbsp; Rule of thumb should be if Lego printed it in the past, they shouldn't sticker it in the future. The past Adventurer sets had all the heiroglyphs printed on.&nbsp; The Tommy guns that are inverted and placed on the top wing&nbsp;are very cool pieces to own and would be great accessories for anyone creating 1920's gangsters.&nbsp; The grappler that hinges under the planbe to retrieve the diamond is simple, but effective.&nbsp; nothing too fancy in the build but it works well and does not detract from the design of the plane.&nbsp; It also swings both ways (heh) and can be placed under the left or right wings when in the ""off"" position.&nbsp; You also get the main character of this set in pilot gear.&nbsp; The sideburns and goatee seem a little out of period, but overall is a nice minifig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real surprise for me were the flying mummies.&nbsp; Their wing construction is very detailed and sturdy. - I guess I expected them to be made of flimsy transparent plastic with a design on them. Not the case at all. Furthermore, their headgear was packed, protected in individual packaging an dhas a nice painted design as well.&nbsp; To add to my amazement, both mummy heads have 2 faces printed on to create a versatile look of individuality or unified mummy army. (Steve and Phil sound like good names for 'em...I dunno, haven't decided yet)&nbsp; These mummies also weild an interesting hue of metalish grey on their spears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pillar itself is a basic build, but of a very nice height.&nbsp; Detailed with worn hieroglyphic stickers and 2 small plants&nbsp;which adorn&nbsp;the base, this structures sole purpose is to protect the soul diamond (so maybe I should have said soul purpose) by means of placing it on a rather large pedistal.&nbsp; Very simple, but works well as a structure especially next to like playsets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another aspect of this set that surprised me was it's colour scheme.&nbsp; Deep dark blue, maroonish red, gold, 2 hues of brown sandy colours.&nbsp; These are all new to my Lego palette and a welcome addition.&nbsp; Very easy on the eyes and they dont contrast with previous sets in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, $15 is the *perfect*&nbsp;price for this set, so if you find this on sale and have yet to own it, I'd recommend it.&nbsp; Because o fthis set I'll be keeping closer tabs on the line and looking at other sets as well.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
