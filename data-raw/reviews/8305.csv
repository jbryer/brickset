"legospongepotter","2011-01-31T20:28:27.12Z","Fear the Serpent!","Another excellent set for the new Pharaoh's Quest theme. This is my set, and my largest. I also own Scarab Attack and Golden Staff Guardians, both reviews are on Brickset. This set is very unique, and the snake is a great part. You get three Minifigures who I will proudly reveal now.&nbsp;<div>(I'm splitting this into sections: Minifigures, Jeep,&nbsp;Accessories, Monument, Snake, and a Quick Review I do with larger sets.)<br><div><br></div><h4>Minifigures:</h4><div>Okay, so like I said, there are three Minifigures: Jake Raines, Helena Tova, and a Snake Charmer Mummy.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Jake Raines - </b>Jake Raines is the leader of the 'good guys' in Pharaoh's Quest. He's a very interesting Minifigure. He has messy black hair that is getting more common and can be seen in sets like the Camper. He has a yellow head with cool&nbsp;sideburns&nbsp;on each side of his face. He has some aftershave and a small triangular beard. He's got a determined eyes, a half-smiling mouth, and a red scratch on the right side of his face.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Jake has a tan jacket on with buttons and a white shirt with an undone collar. He has a brown belt with a silver buckle and a sort of sash with bullets on it, like a bullet holder. I don't know what to call it. He has some back-printing, which consists of the back of his tan jacket. the back of the bullet sash which has a silver buckle, and the back of his belt where you can see some small containers in it, like Batman. He has dark tan legs</div><div><br></div><div><b>Helena Tova - </b>I believe she is the only female character in Pharaoh's Quest. I noticed Minifigures are normally male, but there are a decent amount of females. Anyway, she's a really cool Minifigure. She has reddish-brown Agent hair that is the same color of any of the Weasleys in Harry Potter. It parts on either side of his face and runs along her back in a long ponytail. My only complaint is that it fall of often. Her yellow head is double-sided. On one side she looks&nbsp;determined. She has pink lipstick. on the other side she is afraid and her teeth are showing. It looks like she's shivering or something.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Her torso is pretty cool. She has a necklace with a blue gemstone on it (reminds me of the jewel in 'Flying Mummy Attack') and a white shirt, with a neat collar and it is buttoned. She also has a brown belt with a silver buckle. It has various compartments. On the back you simply see the back of her belt and some lines for her shirt. She has a light tan satchel which hangs from her shoulder and extends to her waist and is made to look like a real bag. It is my first bag like this and it is very cool. Her arms are white bu her hands are brown, like gloves, which is pretty cool. She has black pants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Snake Charmer Mummy - </b>He's my favorite Minifigure. He has the basic mummy outfit with gray skin, He's wearing another cool headdress that extends like a ponytail in the back and has room for one stud up front in the middle, and part of it goes to his shoulders and hangs off them. It is a new tan color so&nbsp;it's&nbsp;very cool, and&nbsp;even&nbsp;better, there are two green snake designs on it. His head is bandaged.&nbsp;completely. He is double-sided, so on one side you can see only a red eye, on the other you can see both eyes, his mouth, and his teeth.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>His torso is also heavily bandaged everywhere so it looks kind of dirty. near his neck is some kind of gold cloth or whatever with dark blue designs. On the back it is generally the same. He has dark gray hands in contrast to his light gray skin. He has light gray legs and it looks like he's wearing these blue robes that stop near his knees. The robes look ripped.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Now that the Minifigures are done, now I will continue with the jeep you get.</div><div><br></div><h4>Jeep</h4><div>Every single Pharaoh's Quest set comes with a rust red vehicle, with the exception of Scarab Attack, the smallest set which is an impulse set. Like I said, the majority of the jeep is rust red and it is a very cool vehicle. Up front there is a couple headlights and a&nbsp;license plate reading 'LC 3957'. On top of the hood is just one smooth piece. Then you get your front window with two lights flanking it.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Now, the seating is pretty cool. It is made of two seats and it is one piece. The doors do not open. There is a black steering wheel in there. As we continue to move back,there is this little piece that has a design of what looks like a rope. In the very back there is a very cool brown crate that has 6 studs in it, but it takes eight to fit it on there. You can put Helena in there. On either side of the awesome crate are two holders. One has a gray rifle and the other has a black shovel. The wheels are pretty big and look heavy duty. The truck is my favorite of the two Pharaoh's Quest vehicles I have, the other being the motorcycle in 'Golden Staff Guardians.' One Minifigure can fit in this jeep easily, but it's a little tight with two.</div><div><br></div><h4>Accessories:</h4><div>There are lots of great accessories in this set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Pistol (x2) - </b>Helena gets a standard pirates pistol. It is gray. You get as a extra piece which I thought was great.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Dynamite - </b>You get a bright red stick of dynamite.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Green Snakes (x2) - </b>These are for the Mummy. I thought they were great. They are basically normal curvy snakes but green. And then you get two. I think they act as weapons for the Mummy. Very cool.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Rifle - </b>I already mentioned this. It is just the standard gray rifle. It is quite long and pretty cool. I think there is one in every PQ set, but I may be wrong.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Shovel - </b>This is a normal black shovel with a flat end. I think there are some in Farmer sets (a sub-theme of City).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Monument:</h4><div>This is where the Mummy stands, and this holds the large snake. It is reasonably large itself. On the bottom is some tan pieces and some black pieces to block out the inside. There is some&nbsp;hieroglyphics. Above there is a small platform that fits a Minifigure. A couple slants pieces flank the platform and in between is a pillar with some&nbsp;hieroglyphics, which are stickers. As you move up you see the point of the set.</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>In this set, Jake&nbsp;Raines&nbsp;and Helena Tova and trying to get the Golden Scarab Shield from the Mummy. It is a normal Scarab shield with lots of detail like a handle in the back, but it is bright gold. Then there is some dark blue pieces and a cool gold piece that tops the monument in a point.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Snake:</h4><p>The snake is the obvious feature of the set. It is pretty long. One and a half of the snakes are the length of my arm. I'll start at the bottom and then end with the top. &nbsp;There is these long tan tail-like pieces that don't even look like Lego.Then it continues in a chain. There are two types of links. There is a small part that has some gold pieces, and then large part with gold pieces, dark blue, tan, and a rusty orange. I would like to note printing on certain pieces. The gold pieces that are sort of slanted but have room at the &nbsp;top have dark printing that looks like a V. It's on all of them, but not very&nbsp;noticeable.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The chain continues and then hits the head. It has a printed piece with some eyes. The snake looks like a girl because of the eyes. The printing looks like bricks. Inside the mouth you can see the tong which comes out of the mouth and it looks like a fork. It has two white fangs. The bottom jaw moves up and down a little. Then there is that big part that sticks out and looks like ears (sorry, i forgot what you call it). It is normal plastic, not regular Legos and attaches easily. It is on there pretty firmly. It has a cool design of tan and dark blue stripes and very big tan circles. which connect at the bottom in a line. In between the two circles is some&nbsp;hieroglyphics.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;The snake attaches to this&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;piece on the back of the monument. However, it falls of easily do I don't really like the design there.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Cursed Cobra Statue Quick Review</h4><div>I do this with bigger sets with long reviews. This is for those who want to read a review fast.</div><div><br></div><div>This set is very cool. It is the third biggest Pharaoh's Quest set. It comes with three Minifigures.</div><div><br></div><div>Jake Raines is the first. He has black hair and some cool sideburns. His torso has a white shirt and tan jacket. He also has light tan legs.</div><div><br></div><div>Helena Tova is second. She has orange Agents hair and is double-sided. She is determined on one side and scared on the other. She gets a pistol and dynamite.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Mummy is third. He has a tan headdress with green snake designs. He has the normal mummy outfit, so he's all bandaged up. He comes with two green snakes. He is double sided. One side shows his whole face, the other just one eye.</div><div><br></div><div>The set comes with a red jeep that has some good seating up front and a black steering wheel, then a crate in the back that can fit some stuff. It has two holders, a gun and shovel.</div><div><br></div><div>It comes with a big monument that some&nbsp;hieroglyphics and a platform for the Mummy. The large snake attaches to it because of a&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;piece in the back. It also holds the golden scarab shield</div><div><br></div><div>The snake has a chain for most of his body with lots of good detail. The head is printed with some eyes. He has white fangs and a forked tongue. His head moves up and down.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h4>Overall</h4><div>Thanks for reading this review. This set obviously is required because of the shield to any Pharaoh's Quest fan. I like this set and think it's really cool. I can't wait to get my next set. I plan on getting all the sets next month but who knows?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</h4><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4
"cadwindu1996","2011-02-19T02:20:12.683Z","the cobra is alive!","<p>Ok well i have to say this set blew me away&nbsp;with awesome minfigs an awesome snake and a jeep it has excellent value for money I actually recieved this as a gift for doing work experience at tesco hythe in colchester by tesco which was very cool.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/InstructionsParts</h4>
<p>The box had some very cool images on front and back and excellent cloth like details to make it look like a map. the instructions were the averedge size of an instruction manual for a 20-30 pound set and had just over 48 pages. the peices were very nice and came in five bags they were not numbered though.I did notice a new peice for the front of the car where the headlights and number plate go.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>jake raines:Ok this is my first jake raines figure ever and i have to say seeing him for myself he is a fantastic hero and well worthy of the title of action hero for the theme.He has a double sided torso and tan trousers both sides of the torso have amazing detail.&nbsp;I hope lego continues with this double sided feel for all of 2011 sets. His hair is cool because the only sets you can get black spiky hair in without paying loads is the collectable minifigures series 1 and 2 so it is easy to get if you get raines. if you get a spare raines in perhaps scarab attack you can put his head on a tux body to give him an indy feel.</p>
<p>Helen tova/skvalling?:Ok i just want to clear this up she is only refered to as tova in&nbsp;the description of the set on lego.com however every where else she is skvalling so i will just refer to her as helen.She has excellent detail on both sides of the torso and carries a light tan indiana jones satchel however i think hers is more acurate to the indiana jones movies.She comes with a pistol and can be given dynamite she has black legs and earth orange&nbsp;hair like obi wan's but in the style of the collectable minfigure lifeguard's hair.She also has a scared face and a determined face.</p>
<p>mummy snake guy:He is basically the same mummy from the other set golden staff guardians with added snake head dress which is awesomely detailed and two green snakes from the indiana jones set well of souls.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Quite an easy build until you get to the snake but even that isn't that hard you just have to follow instructions 8 times over to make the body and tail then the head is very simple.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>the completed model looks very cool especially combined with golden staff guardians the snake poised over the statue ready to pounce on the intruders the mummy holding his snakes poised to throw them and the adventurers walking or rather driving into a Trap.However one complaint snake does hot fit into the statue very well and is quite loose apart from that set is fine.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall an excellent set and a definate recommend to others get this et or you will regret it!</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"K_nut","2011-02-27T08:50:53.783Z","The worst Pharaohs Quest set, but still pretty good.","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>When I picked this set up at TRU, I was excited because I thought that it would be very playable. I went home, built it, and was sort of&nbsp;disappointed.<h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Minifigs</h4><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The minifigs are&nbsp;possibly the best part of this set. Jake Raines, we've seen him before so I don't really need to go into much detail there. Helena Skavling is a great figure and her torso can basically fit into all themes. Unlike the picture here on brickset, her hands are brown instead of yellow, and in my opinion, they look much better. The snake charmer mummy is just like any other mummy, with the&nbsp;reversible&nbsp;face. The only unique part about him is his&nbsp;headdress. His headdress is dark tan and has a nice, simple pattern of a snake on it.</p><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Car</h4><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The car is very good but awkward looking. If you look at it closely, the front and back seem to stick out a little too far. The color scheme on all the Pharaohs Quest vehicles have that nice, rugged feel to them.</p><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Pyramidy, Statue thing</h4><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>I really don't know what to call this, but it does look kind of neat.

The shield looks very cool in gold color.</p><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Snake</h4><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The snake is the worst part of this set. It is good for parts, but impossible to pose. It's very knobbly and only falls over when not on the pyramidy, statue thing. When on it, it has much more&nbsp;poseability.</p><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Overall</h4><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This is definitely the worst of the Pharaohs Quest sets, besides the coin bank of course. Overall, it is pretty good looking when it sits next to other Pharaohs Quest sets, but is very hard to play with the snake. It is much smaller then it looks on the box. If you're a collector like me, you should get this but if not, you still should get it&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"Hobie819","2012-03-23T19:28:28.177Z","Saw this on clearance - couldn't pass it up and not disappointed","<p>I found this set on clearance at the local BX (military base exchange).&nbsp; They typically always have a few sets on clearance (50% off) so this one was up when I went in today.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box and instructions are par for the course. As with most newer models the instructions show on the top of the page what parts are used in the steps&nbsp; There was a small misprint with the box as others have noted in that the box shows Helena's hands as a different color but nothing major.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a lot of unique parts to this set as well as parts to use for later models. Yeah, the stickers suck but there weren't too many to put on (2 for the car, 2 for the statue). The main thing that confused me was the mix between printed parts and stickers. Some printed parts suprised me (the snakes head for instance where it is only used in this model) while more common parts such as the hieroglyphics were stickers.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Both figures are nice.&nbsp; Nothing super special with any of them but the hair on Helena is a pretty nice hair style for the figures thnat I didn't have before.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Very repetitive... I didn't expect anything less considering you're building a giant snake but there also wasn't anything that stood out at me or gave me any ideas for future builds.&nbsp; It was pretty strait forward.&nbsp; If you're looking for simple then the set is for you.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is pretty nice.&nbsp; My main suggestion for improvement would be to change the blue connector in the back of the tower to be a full connector instead of the x connector to the snake. This would allow the snake to stay on the tower easier for poses and whatnot.&nbsp; The playability factor is great - my 3 year old son (who also loves LEGO's) has bene playing with it since we built it.&nbsp; If you are a true AFOL (one that doesn't ""play"" with their models much), the tower offers a good stand for the snake to pose giving the model a nice display look to it.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In reality I couldn't complain much about it. I got the set for 15 US dollars which is an outstanding price per brick and the playability will keep my son and I entertained for awhile.&nbsp; Add this to our Indiana Jones theme legos and the few ones I had from the original adventure series and we have a fairly nice middle east treasure hunting scene to play with.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 52 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of great pieces which are very useful for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure. This set has a lot of tan and 'fake gold' pieces, too.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs look very cool. The mummy has two green snakes and a nice looking hood. The back of the face and the torso are printed. The other figure we get is Jake Raines. It's a cool character but I like Johnny Thunder from the old LEGO Adventurers theme more. The figure has some cool markings on the front and on the back of his torso. The last minifig we get is Helena Tova. She looks very hot for a minifig and I like the hair piece which LEGO has given her. On the back on the torso and on the face we can also see some printings.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very fun and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on. This set took me 22 minutes and 31 seconds.<br></p>

On the statue we can also see a golden scarab piece which the explorers have to get. The head and the tail of the snake can be adjusted very easily as well. The head of the snake is printed for my surprise and the mouth can be opened and closed, too. The jeep looks great as well. I love the colors on it and it's also nice to see that LEGO uses the cockpit piece which we've seen on a lot of those vehicles from the old LEGO Adventurers theme before.

"AETerry","2012-01-27T14:11:13.3Z","Cursed Cobra Statue Review","<p>The whole of the Pharaoh's Quest line is a revisit to the older Adventurers theme LEGO did many years ago, mainly the Desert Sub-theme of that series. And frankly, I rather like this series and much of the feel of this theme.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are in booklet form with illustrated step-by-step pictures of the build, followed by a catalog of pieces in the set in case of needing to reorder or replace missing pieces.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>At 213 pieces, the set doesn't feel it's worth the $29.99 in some ways. Like it falls a bit short. I'd say it's worth it though for many of the ball joints in this set for those looking for those style of pieces for other MOCs.</p><p>It also seems inconsistant to have a printed brick for the cobra's head and stickers that are placed on the obelisk and car.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get three minifigures. That of Jake Rains, Helena Tova and a Mummy.</p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The set is built in three parts.</p><p>1st - Jeep - Jake and Helena's car that they use to get away from the snake. The build is fairly standard and offers some good color choices of that dark burgundy for the jeep.</p><p>2nd - Obelisk - while it's not too exciting a build, it provides something for the cobra statue to rest on and a repository for the gold scarab shield that the Mummy is guarding.</p><p>3rd - Cobra Statue - While much of this build is repetitive for the different segments, the final build of the snake is pretty solid. There's a thin, almost paper-like plastic for the Cobra's hood. Otherwise you have a good build that clearly looks like what it's supposed to be.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4>
<p>As stated above, I rather like this theme and have enjoyed collecting up the sets for it. Very Indiana Jones like or the newer series with Brandon Frasier of The Mummy. I am glad that LEGO opted for focusing on doing a few well done sets rather than cranking out numerous sets and designs just to milk it for tired, redone models. All of the Pharaoh's Quest sets stand out on their own from other Adventurer sets.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"wander099","2011-04-13T22:55:12.653Z","Awesome looking cobra, less awesome set...","<p>This was the set that initially drew my attention to the Pharaoh's Quest theme.&nbsp; Naturally, I had to have it and I think I will end up with all the sets except for the really big pyramid one (I hate the baseplate...a lot).<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art is really great.&nbsp; It makes this set, in my opinion, the most visually appealing.&nbsp; I just loved how the snake looked.&nbsp; The instructions consisted of a single booklet and the bags were not numbered-par for the course on a set this size and of this complexity.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some really great parts in this set.&nbsp; The most obvious one is the large thin plastic piece attached to the cobra.&nbsp; The plastic is thicker and more sturdy than I expected, this is not something that will accidentally rip one day if you treat it well.&nbsp; The cobra's upper jaw is also printed (unfortunately the pieces of the pillar are not, but I'll get to that later).&nbsp; This set also comes with the old vehicle body in dark red as well as the many gold pieces used for the cobra.&nbsp; And of course there is the golden scarab shield.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get three with this set: Jake Raines (the exact same one AGAIN!), Helena Tova, and a snake-charmer mummy.&nbsp; Jake is nothing special, the same figure is included in two other sets, including the Scarab Attack set, so if you're just after him, just buy the cheap one. <br></p><p>However, this is the only set that includes Helena Tova, so she is a good reason to buy this set if you are a fan of the theme and want all the characters.&nbsp; Her hands are brown for some reason (unlike pictures on the box) and from what I hear that is true across the board.&nbsp; I don't know if Lego just made a mistake in making her or if they just forgot to change the box after altering the colour.&nbsp; All in all, she's a cool figure, she's got a printed torso and a cool shoulder bag that I didn't have in my collection before.</p><p>Finally, the mummy.&nbsp; Compared to the ones in other sets, this one is just alright.&nbsp; He's got the same head, torso, and legs.&nbsp; The only difference is that his headdress has a couple of snakes painted on it and he comes with two green snakes to wave around.&nbsp; Compared to the flying mummies I got in one of the other sets, this one just doesn't measure up.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was pretty easy, and when it got to the body of the snake, it was repetitive.&nbsp; And there were a bunch of stickers for the pillar as well as the vehicle.&nbsp; Some of them, particularly the ones for the car, were a pain to get into place.&nbsp; I really dislike the plentiful stickers in this theme.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Overall, the model is pretty good.&nbsp; I love the way the snake can be posed on the pillar and made to attack the adventurers as they try to get the shield.&nbsp; The snake is kind of hard to pose though and is really limited when posed separate from the pillar (will fall down a lot if you aren't careful how you pose it!)&nbsp; And I think it would have looked better if the pillar was taller .&nbsp; I am not so crazy about the car.&nbsp; Visually, it is fine, but practically, there is an issue because you cannot fit both adventurers in the car at the same time.&nbsp; The second figure must be placed standing in the crate at the back, which is somewhat annoying since the car could have been made to fit both.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In short, this set looks a whole lot better than it is.&nbsp; I would recommend this set only if you are a fan of the theme or really want the snake.&nbsp; It is a bit pricey for what it includes and unless you really want all the characters from the theme or you really like the snake, it just isn't worth the money.&nbsp; I suspect that younger children would really like this set, but for older children and adults, it is less attractive and you should only buy it if you are really sure you want it.&nbsp; Personally, it goes well with my Temple of Anubis from the old adventurer's theme (as do many of the other sets in this theme), so that could be another reason to get it if you own some of those old sets.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,3
"xccj","2011-03-09T23:54:56.32Z","The Minifigures are Great, and the Cobra is Just a Supporting Role","<p>The new Pharaoh's Quest theme is a fun concept that hasn't been seen since Johnny Thunder, and the Cursed Cobra set fits the theme nicely.&nbsp; It comes with a couple of explorers, a nice vehicle, and a big, Egyptian-style enemy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigures are the main appeal to this set.&nbsp; They have lots of nice detail, particularly Helena.&nbsp; The truck itself looks pretty swell, even though the build isn't spectacular.&nbsp; The cobra is okay but certainly not the best enemy out there.&nbsp; The head design is great, but the sockets that make up the rest of the body make it hard to pose.&nbsp; Although, to be fair, that's pretty much guaranteed for any snake model.&nbsp; And the temple is really only there to support the cobra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the role playing just isn't enough, then the parts selection is really great.&nbsp; There are some neat recolored pieces, as well as lots of tan, dark tan, and gold elements.&nbsp; Plus, the minifigure parts make it all worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a little pricey for what it contains, but if it can be found on sale, then it's certainly worth it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"vith","2011-03-28T14:55:46.37Z","This got me back into Lego...","<p>So, one day I was at the local toy shop, don't ask me why but I feel I had to take a look at the new Lego sets. I'm 20 years old now (hehe). And I parted, after a long debate with this set. (The other choice was brickbeard's bounty, but that wouldn't fit on my bookshelves.) <br></p><p><br></p>So I came home after a twenty-minute busride and I immediately began, just like the old days unpacking the set on the carpet, in front of the television. <br><br>Aaaah the joy I had...<br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great fun to build<br></li><li>Wow, it's a bloody snake!<br></li><li>Oh my, the minifigures are cool</li><li>The car is really nice<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The little temple is a bit too little (but you buy the set for the snake anyway)<br></li><li>This got me back into Lego. *sigh*<br></li></ul><p><br></p><p>At around 32 EUR, you'll get a scary serpent, a sexy mummy armed with two green snakes and a jeep with two heroes in it. It's, as always a bit expensive but hey.. It's a toy that will last forever. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,3
