"Niallskie","2010-11-17T14:05:28.72Z","Go fetch!","<p>I got this set along with the 7306 at our local TRU, again I was very happy because it was not overpriced and it was released a couple of weeks earlier than our local lego store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an amazing set, the build was fabulous and worth purchasing. The inner sanctum where the golden sword is place is an awesome build, would have been better if the stickered columns are actually printed bricks. Not really a big fan of stickers coz they eventually peal off or put in unevenly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I say about the Spinx? not only that it is a great display, it is also a functional giant dog. The sanctum actually sits under the Spinx's belly when its sitting down, as if its guarding it.&nbsp;Playability of this set is really good, I also love the fact that they put some vegitation on the Spinx's legs to show it had been guarding the Golden Sword for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigures are alright, in my opinion it could have added a couple of more minifigs. An extra mummy&nbsp;and a girl minifig will better make it worth the price. Not to compare to the other sets like the Burrow, that set has more minifigure though the $10 price difference is worth it im sure, and those minifigures are solid characters and worth a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beat up car is nicely conceptualized, love the color scheme and is great for the set. All in all this is a great set and would sit beside the 7327 when it comes out. I actually recently got 5988 (Temple of Anubis) and had two of the Spinx on both side. Now I'm really excited for the release of 7327.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"therealindy","2010-12-15T15:14:05.453Z","Another Art-Deco masterpiece to make people go ""ooh and ah"" at the office!","<p>Wow, this set is a work of art, and wildly imaginative! &nbsp;Another Art-Deco masterpiece to make people go &quot;ooh and ah&quot; at the office! &nbsp;After this, there can be no comparison to the older Adventurers line from the 90s. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In all my travel and study, I have never seen a Jackal-Headed, or Anubis-Headed Sphinx, but there are many sphinx-like creatures in Egyptian Mythology with human heads, ram's heads, and heads like Seth, the enigmatic god of Chaos.</p>
<p>So this is something that definitely could exist, but has never been seen before, like a brand new discovery! &nbsp;The face, the expression, the scowl and snarl are all realized perfectly... &nbsp;Plus the hot rod car is super... &nbsp;Extra credit to LEGO for this work!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"UFO_and_Insectoids","2011-01-08T21:09:26.763Z","What lies in the shadow of the statue!","<p>I recieved this set along with all of the other Pharaoh's Quest sets for Christmas. And I must say this one and the pyramid are my 2 favorite ones!</p>
<p>This set is a remake of the classic Adventurers set 5978 ""Sphinx Secret Suprise"", the set features a giant posable Sphinx with the head of the egyptian god Anubis that sits on top of a small&nbsp;chamber that holds one of the many artifacts belonging to Pharaoh Amset-Ra, the Golden Sword! The set also includes an old fashioned desert rig that has storage for a rifle and pic-axe!</p>
<p>This is an awesome set, and a great addition&nbsp;for anyone collecting the Pharaoh's Quest sets, or anyone who just wants to buy&nbsp;one cool LEGO&nbsp;statue!</p>
<p>Here are the pros and cons-</p>
<p>Pros-</p>
<p>-Awesome minifigures, includes Jake Raines and 2 mummy warriors!</p>
<p>-Cool vehicle, includes rifle, axe, and dynamite!</p>
<p>-Fully posable Sphinx, stands a max height of 20cm and 23cm long</p>
<p>-Temple holding one of the 6 artifacts of Amset-Ra, the golden sword!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons-</p>
<p>-None that I can think of, other than I thought the car included a map and it didn't but judging this set overall, I&nbsp;have nothing to complain about!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall- 5/5!</p>

"AETerry","2012-01-13T14:16:33.593Z","Rise of the Sphinx Review","<p>I picked this up using a gift card from Christmas and with some good timing and prices, got this for far cheaper than retail so I can't complain at all about the price on this.</p><p>With the Sphinx set, I'm down to just one last Pharaoh's Quest set to get a hold of and hopefully that won't be too expensive of an endeavor... or least wise, it won't hit me in the wallet that hard.<br></p><p></p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art depicting the set is good, I have to say it doesn't do the set justice though. Which is actually a good thing.</p><p>The instructions like many of LEGO's instructions are in booklet form with illustrated step by step pictures of the build and easy to follow. They are time consuming though.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>With 527 pieces, there's plenty here that even with full retail price, you've gotten your money's worth. There's a lot tan colors for building with. Most notable are the joint and hinge pieces of this set for those looking for sets to buy with ""robot"" parts rather than going through LEGO's pick-a-brick feature. Gold scorpion pieces and golden sword can also be found in this set for those looking for some.<br></p><p>Love them or hate them, there are also stickers a plenty in this set for the hieroglyphs. Careful placing and handling, you shouldn't have too much problem with them.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are a total of three minifigures in this set. Two mummies with the black headdresses that I love. You also have the adventurer Jake Raines in an aviator jacket.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed mode</h4><p>Overall the build is comparatively easy for me but time consuming. <br></p><p>The Sphinx - I have to note though that the Sphinx itself is very deceptive as the box art for the intricacies of this build aren't clearly shown. I found myself very engaged when I got to the head and switching colors for the different layers of the head and the muzzle. The legs are far more stable than I had originally supposed from the box art.</p><p>Vault - This the building the Sphinx sits on that holds the golden sword treasure. Without the sphinx sitting on it, this piece is rather boring and with all the gaps in the wall, I have to wonder why Jake needs dynamite to get the sword out instead of just reaching in through a hole to reach it. There's a push pole on the back of to eject the sword out once Jake's place his dynamite piece.<br></p><p>Roadster - The roadster car that Jakes drives in this set didn't really appeal to me. I appreciate the effort and design from LEGO, I just didn't like it, as if it could have been left out as other sets also have Jake and his crew with vehicles already.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>The sphinx very much so makes this set for me with the vault and roadster that Jake can speed away in adding character. I very much so enjoy this expansion and update to the Adventurers line LEGO has done in the past and while it doesn't look like it will extend into 2012, I'm glad they weren't trying to crank out numerous ""garbage sets"" for this theme to make a buck. Not when there's plenty of other themes LEGO has that do bring in revenue for them.</p><p>If you like the Pharaoh's Quest theme, this set is worth it and shouldn't be missed. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Kooz","2013-02-26T14:24:47.107Z","Pleasantly surprised!","<p>This is a nice set that I picked up on eBay at well below retail. &nbsp;It had a high piece count (&gt;500) so I went for it. &nbsp;In an attempt to make a useful review, I will be brief.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Box is pretty big, taped in the recent LEGO fashion making for easy opening. &nbsp;Inside, the instruction manuals float freely, getting a bit bent by the box contents. &nbsp;The art makes this set look a bit lame.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Nothing terribly unusual. &nbsp;I suppose my favorite parts are the flat panels with hieroglyphs on them. &nbsp;I hate stickers as much as the next guy, but these really add to the completed model, and it wouldn't be the same without them.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>You get two mummies wearing ancient Egyptian headdresses. &nbsp;Both are pretty well-detailed and interesting. &nbsp;They wear tattered shirts instead of mummy bandages on their legs, which along with their slightly grey color distinguishes them from the Monster Fighters and minifig lines.</div><div><br></div><div>You also get Jake Raines, a somewhat unremarkable character in the mold of Indiana Jones and Lara Croft. &nbsp;In this iteration, he's wearing a bomber jacket and looks a bit boring.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>More interesting than I anticipated. &nbsp;Building the head of the Anubis sphinx was more complex than it looks, and although there don't seem to be any special techniques, the build was not an ordinary brick-on-brick build. &nbsp;Excluding the car, which was very basic and simplistic.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>Much cooler than the box makes it out to be. &nbsp;It's sturdy and playable, looks really cool, and has some fun functionality (the Anubis sphinx can stand and be posed; Jake can use dynamite to blow a wall down--operated by a push button; a golden sword can be slid out of a secret chamber; the Anubis sphinx's mouth can open and close). &nbsp;This is a very playable set.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Summary</b></div><p>I was skeptical that this would be any good, and looked forward to the build only to sate my desire to build LEGOs. &nbsp;I was pleasantly surprised by the finished product and would recommend this to anyone with children or who likes ancient Egypt, adventurer, or monster(ish) themes.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4
"T79","2014-04-25T11:27:19.513Z","Hungry Hungry Sphinx!","<p>Recently someone gave the children some lego and since they liked it so much I&#39;d figure it&#39;s about time to get all those old sets from my childhood back down from the attic. Until that happens though, I just happened to come upon this and thought: &#39;well, why not&#39;.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box itself didn&#39;t really convince me, I didn&#39;t buy it until I did some research on it first (which is how I ended up at brickset) but after that decided to go for it anyway since it was sold for about half RRP. Although the fact that it&#39;s been about 20 years or so since last I bought lego (or indeed, played with) might have something to do with this, thinking it&#39;ll never be as good again as back then when I was a kid.</p>

<p>The instructions were clear enough, as I had no problems at all building the set. It did take the better part of the evening though, but with all these new colours and pieces (again, for me), well I had to take a good look at them now didn&#39;t I?</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Plenty!&nbsp;Seeing what other sets I used to have this one immediately ranks up in&nbsp;my top 10 of &#39;biggest&#39; (by piece count)&nbsp;sets.&nbsp;I especially like those dark red and dark blue pieces, too bad there&#39;s not more of them here. Tan and dark tan are in no short supply however. And oh, gone are the days when gold used to be represented by yellow!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Very nice, but then again I&#39;m used to having a torso printed on just one side with one or two colours so these are a huge leap forward! Either way the mummies are superb, my only gripes with the minifigures here would be:</p>

<p>1) Another &#39;good guy&#39; minifig would have been&nbsp;a nice addition&nbsp;(the sphinx gets so tired of chomping on Jake that in desperation&nbsp;it starts eating the mummies as well...)</p>

<p>2) Those Anubis warriors from the Pyramid seem to be so much more apt for this set? Why wasn&#39;t one included here too, in addition to or even in place of the mummies?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As said before, not too complicated and rather pleasing but&nbsp;a bit&nbsp;long, especially when you get to the four legs which are more or less identical. The head is probably my favourite part to build as it just looks so good. Some stickers have to be applied but at least they don&#39;t go over several pieces and they&#39;re pretty easy to get in place.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>All in all, a lot better then I would have thought! The car is nice if a bit bare (that gap over the rear wheels), the vault on its own (without the sphinx over it)&nbsp;is rather fragile, open&nbsp;and not&nbsp;very interesting and the body and legs of the sphinx could use&nbsp;a bit more form but all together it&#39;s very fun to play with. The legs are very posable, the car zoomable and the &#39;exploding wall&#39; works as expected, but the main feature for my kids is without a doubt the working mouth of the sphinx! Everything (and I do mean everything) that is lying around is just there to be used as food, and an occasional loose tooth or even lower jaw does not spoil the fun!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>That last part should explain the title of this review and also why it&#39;s a shame there&#39;s only one sphinxbait, I mean, one&nbsp;minifigure to be eaten (I exclude the mummies). Two would have doubled the fun! For the price I got this I&#39;d say definitely worth the money, I&#39;m not sure I would have bought it at full price but either way, I&#39;m glad I have it and so are my children!</p>

<p>EDIT: more than a year and a half after I wrote my review and this set still is one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;boys&#39;&nbsp;favourites, it absolutely deserved those 5 stars for overall rating and playability! I am taking away one point for parts though, as during this time I&#39;ve had several of those&nbsp;&#39;bamboo&#39; bricks used in the legs&nbsp;losing one or two leaves due to the way the sphinx is played with. A minor point but a bit unfortunate.</p>
