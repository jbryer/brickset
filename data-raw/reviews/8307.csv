"WiseWarrior","2010-11-18T20:13:00.82Z","An amazing set","I remember the original Egyptian theme back when the Adventurers were around. There were some great sets made in that theme, but sadly it ended and there have been no more Egyptian sets since then. But at long last the wait is over! Lego has released the ""Pharaoh's Quest"" sets, and quite a few of them got me excited, none more than the Scorpion Pyramid.<div><br></div><div>Despite having a low piece count for a $100 set, there are a lot of large pieces, the biggest being the gigantic baseplate the set is built upon. Included are a giant scorpion, a car, and the pyramid itself. While the original Egyptian theme didn't have a pyramid, this more than makes up for that. While it's not completely pyramid-ish (It's flat on the back side) it for the most part is a great representation of a real pyramid. Sadly there are stickers, I've never minded them much and the hieroglyphics are pretty cool. Now then, onto the different sections of the set:</div><div><br></div><div><b>Mini-Figures: 10/10</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Amazing. The only other theme with better figures is the Atlantis theme. You get two Anubis Creatures, which are excellent designed and come with a sword and scarab shield. You also get a Flying Mummy, which is a very original concept and the wings are quite cool. The Pharaoh himself has a stunning golden headdress and a two-sided head, one face golden and one the standard mummy head. The explorers are much less creative, but still look the part. Overall the mini-figures in this set are very impressive.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Car: 9/10</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Very impressive car. High level of detail, and I love the gun and the trunk. Sadly the trunk doesn't hold accessories too well and they tend to fall out, especially the spear. That's my only complaint though.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Scorpion: 10/10</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>A Scorpion Pyramid isn't complete without a scorpion, and the one included is humongous. It has movable legs, pincers, and tail. It can sit on the completed pyramid and devour explorers and mummies alike if they walk too close. Very impressive.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Pyramid: 10/10</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Finally, a pyramid! And a giant one to boot. With plenty of traps and secrets this is one of, if not the, best Egyptian set ever made. While it's flat on the back for playability's sake, it still looks very impressive and there's a lot too it.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Stairs</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>The stairs that lead to the entrance can be pulled up to reveal a scorpion. Who in their right mind would do that I do not know.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Entrance</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>The pyramid has sliding doors that when closed show an image of Anubis. Very cool feature.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Pharaoh's Tomb</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>Like all proper pyramids, this one has an eject switch, which tosses out the tomb of the pharaoh like yesterday's garbage. Thankfully he's dead so he doesn't care. It's a pretty cool feature, and the switch is hidden by the wall so it doesn't subtract at all from the pyramid's design.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Trapdoor</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>Hidden in the back of the pyramid is the ever-necessary trapdoor, which dumps a load of bricks on anyone unlucky enough to walks in that particular spot.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Golden Headdress</i></div><div><br></div><div>The pharaoh's headdress is hidden behind one of the walls of the pyramid. It's one of the six golden treasures and is pretty cool.</div><div><br></div><div><i>Pits</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>There're a couple pits in the front of the pyramid where scorpions and snakes make their home, and one of them has treasure in it.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Overall this set is top-notch, and I high recommend it!</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"yodaccm","2010-12-07T18:27:58.163Z","A New Lego Adventure Begins!","<h4>Beware the curse of Amset-Ra!</h4><div><br></div><div>Pharaoh's Quest is an exciting new addition to the ever expanding universe of Lego adventure-themed lines. &nbsp;Harkening back to the Adventurer's line from the late '90's, Pharaoh's Quest narrows its focus strictly to the plundering of ancient Egyptian treasures, and with great success!</div><div><br></div><div>The flagship model of the inaugural Pharaoh's Quest run is the excellent ""Scorpion Pyramid"". &nbsp;Coming in at a hefty $99 MSRP and boasting nearly 800 pieces, this set throws everything you will expect from this new line unabashedly and right in your face. &nbsp;Mummies, giant monsters, huge ancient structures, booby traps, armored vehicles, weathered adventurers...it is all here and in force. &nbsp;This set is a home run in my opinion.</div><div><br></div><div>Let's get the minifigures out of he way. &nbsp;Coming in at 7 figures, it may be a bit on the light side in terms of it's price, however these are some of the greatest figures I've seen in a non-Star Wars Lego set in a while. &nbsp;We have three adventurers on a quest to plunder the Golden Artifacts to prevent the awakening of the evil mummy: &nbsp;Amset-Ra. &nbsp;These are relatively standard characters: &nbsp;a professor type, decked out with a satchel bag, khaki fatigues, and standard expedition hat. &nbsp;There is the young hero template, with roguish hair, bandoleer strapped across his chest and pistol at the ready. &nbsp;Finally, the heroes round out their numbers with the mechanic character, dressed in a oil stained shirt, suspenders, cap and nine o'clock shadowed visage. &nbsp;Together, they will have to face a horde of undead creatures.</div><div><br></div><div>Leading this army of creatures is Amset-Ra, the mummy king whose followers are attempting to raise from his tomb. &nbsp;He comes with the Golden Pharaoh's headress and a dual sided face, one the golden, mystic stare of an ancient Egyptian king, the other a mummified, bandaged wrapped ghoulish glare. &nbsp;He is guarded by two jackal-headed Anubis warriors who brandish deadly curved swords and fend off attacks with their scarab shields. &nbsp;They are a bluish-black color that is quite striking against the otherwise earth toned colors of the pyramid. &nbsp;The falcon winged flying mummy swoops down upon his prey carrying a black spear, his long wingspan blocking casting dark shadows upon his prey before they realize it is too late!</div><div><br></div><div>Of course, we must discuss the Scorpion who apparently makes it's home perched atop the ancient temple. &nbsp;This massive beast has a posable tail with an imposing stinger at the tip to impale any adventurer who gets too close. &nbsp;Of course, that if they don't get snatched up by the two huge claws this beast brandishes. &nbsp;This eight-legged arachnid can easily grasp onto the side of the pyramid and looks absolutely imposing to any explorer foolish enough to get close enough.</div><div><br></div><div>However, our heroes aren't totally unprepared. &nbsp;To blast through the unforgiving dunes of the desert, they mount up on the heavily armed and armored ATV. &nbsp;With two heavy treads on the back, this heavy vehicle can easily transport our heroes to the base of the pyramid. &nbsp;And if the odds are against them, the machine gun perched on the back of the ATV will give them an edge against their undead adversaries. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, after facing giant scorpions and undead warriors, our heroes must face the perils of the pyramid itself! &nbsp;Past two sliding doors, can they make it past the falling block trap? &nbsp;Will they find the golden headress? &nbsp;Can they blow open the mummy's tomb with the dynamite? &nbsp;There are plenty of snakes and scorpions to hinder their quest, too! &nbsp;One could argue this is not a true pyramid as the back in flat and open, but it lends itself to easier access and playability. &nbsp;Also, the large base plate may be a bit lazy, but it actually works well with this set, but there is one ""pit"" on the base plate this is not used at all and is simply covered by plates. &nbsp;The tall obelisk at the entrance of the pyramid really takes this set to another level. My only gripe is the stickers! &nbsp;Of course...this time more so due to finding my sticker sheet completely ravaged when I pulled it out from the box. &nbsp;Stickers were bent and coming off of the sheet, sticking to the bags. &nbsp;However, they stuck just fine to the pieces, so no harm to foul.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this set is fantastic. &nbsp;It has plenty of playability, many fun details and gadgets, some really detailed and new minifigures, and a sense of real, classic adventure. &nbsp;Your Indiana Jones sets will nicely compliment this set, along with the Pharaoh and Mummy figure from the Collectible Minifigures. &nbsp;You could even throw in the Explorer and Brush Pilot figure to round out your adventurers!</div><div><br></div><div>I highly recommend this set and look forward to seeing where Pharaoh's Quest takes us in the future!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"therealindy","2010-12-10T09:53:00.69Z","Completely satisfied with this set!","<p><br></p><p>At first, I was planning on getting two of this set, plus some extra bricks on LEGO Pick-A-Brick, so I could make a complete pyramid with 45 degree sides, but as soon as I finished this set, I was completely satisfied with the design of it exactly as it is right out of the box!</p><p><br></p><p>As other reviewers have mentioned, the angles of the pyramid are not exact, but the optical illusion works perfectly nicely, and makes the whole thing the right depth so it can fit on a normal size shelf. &nbsp;I do not think they skimped at all, they just used smart design choices.</p><p><br></p><p>The layers of bricks on the front face are very reminiscent of The Stepped Pyramid of Zoser at Saqqara in Egypt, and it looks very cool when it is lit from slightly behind. &nbsp;The plates on the sides allow a lot more usable room inside, so the minifigs can stand in the side chambers.</p><p><br></p><p>If you like, you can fit some of the architectural elements from the other sets neatly into the empty 6x6 pits on the right and left sides, but I decided to leave it as open space. &nbsp;In the end, this set looks like the ultimate lair for an Egypt-themed Super-villain, like Ozymandias!</p><p><br></p><p>Fortune and Glory!</p><p><br></p><p>The_Real_Indy</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"UFO_and_Insectoids","2011-01-09T20:58:26.543Z","The Scorpion, The Pharaoh, and The Golden Nemes!","<p>Part of the reason I love this set is because it reminds me so much of the older ""Adventurers"" theme pyramid, only this set looks more like a pyramid! It includes awesome minifigures including the Pharaoh, Amset Ra himself! It has&nbsp;original as well as new&nbsp;features to it, such as the classic trap door with falling rocks and the blow out door feature on the side! It also includes a giant scorpion guardian that sits on the&nbsp;pyramid balcony!&nbsp;The inside only gets better! There is a secret shrine with a gem and the&nbsp;last of the Pharaohs relics, the golden headdress!&nbsp;Below are the pros and cons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>-Great minifigs, including Pharaoh Amset Ra and new Anubis warriors!</p>
<p>-Cool features and ancient booby traps!</p>
<p>-Ancient golden treasures such as golden coffin lid, gem, and the golden headdress!</p>
<p>-Includes a vehicle and giant scorpion!</p>
<p>-Very detailed looking decals!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>-There are very little to no cons I can think of except for the gun on the back of the vehicle is a little hard to&nbsp;put minifigures with and the set is a little spendy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall: I give this set a 5/5 rating because despite the price it's very good for money value. It maintains some original features of the older version while keeping an excellent pyramid shape and addition of newer features! And it's an awesome final touch (OR FIRST)&nbsp;for any Pharaohs Quest set collector. Well done LEGO for creating this theme!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"BobaFett2","2011-01-12T17:42:07.83Z","Amazing Set. Now let's discuss prices...","<p>I got this set a few months before 2011. It was fun having it ""early"", and I couldn't wait ever since I learned about it in summer 2011.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>They provide a nice high quality background for the box. It's not perfect, but it will do. The theme logo is nice, and they set up a very nice scene.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has incredible parts. Like the largest set from the Adventurers Egypt subtheme, this set is full of tan. But not only does it have tan-it has dark tan, earth orange, dark blue, and gold. There is a huge number of tan slope bricks. You get a lot of dark blue roof bricks, many cones in dark blue and gold, a lot of dark tan tiles and plates, and more. In the scorpion you get five parts which are printed, as well as a lot of rare dark tan parts. The list goes on. My one complaint about this set is the stickers. They have bad sticking power, and stand out. They've been peeling off since I got them, and I wish they would just print the parts. Then I'd have a lot of cool hieroglyph parts for a long time, not just for half a year...<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Awesome. As this is the only set in which you get a full-quality Anubis Guard (probably one of the most popular recent Minifigures), you know you're getting something great. But the list doesn't stop there-you get Amset-Ra, the master of evil, with a sweet death mask face. You also get three out of the four adventurers, with Archibald being unique to this set. All have really useful torsos and faces. Lastly, you get a flying mummy, which is a nice Minifigure, but really-the Anubis Guards are number 1.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's very fun. LEGO made near perfect use of the baseplate. The pyramid has a few cool functions and many great details. The scorpion is simple but fun, with an odd technique for the legs, and the vehicle has a very nice build.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The vehicle has a mounted machine gun in the back, but the only way to make use of it is while standing on the back. The Minifigure doesn't fit in the little space for them, but nothing's perfect, and LEGO would have to have a non-mounted machine gun to do so-something they probably wish to avoid. Otherwise, it's awesome-especially the tank treads.</p><p><br></p><p>The scorpion looks very nice. It's flat, the pincers and tail move, and it looks pretty imposing.</p><p><br>The pyramid itself is spectacular. It has a lot of great functions, such as a trap, an ""explosion"" wall, and opening doors. The balcony is a nice touch. The only sad thing is that the interior is pretty devoid of detail. The stairs were nicely built. They flip up, and underneath is a scorpion. It doesn't really do the trick though, at least not alone. Unfortunately, the area in front of the pyramid is pretty bare. The snake pit is easy to avoid, and the snakes could easily get out of it in real life. The obelisk makes up for this, although it doesn't have very good sticking power.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>It's awesome. Not perfect, but nearly so. The price tag is a bit too high-a worse price per part than Star Wars sets. The stickers are amazing, but peel off. On the other side, Minifigures, parts, build, and set are all awesome. If LEGO had included more parts as they should have at this price, the set would probably be one of their top-selling products.<br><br>I recommend this to all Egypt, Adventurers, and action fans. Anyone who needs tan, who likes these Anubis Guard, or anyone else really. It will be worth it.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"K_nut","2011-02-27T12:13:28.573Z","A better then perfect set.","<p>This is a set that when I first saw the pics, I knew it was a must have for me. I'm not someone who saves their money but for this, I knew I'd have to. 2 1/2 months waiting for this set was&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;worth it.</p>
<h4>Minifigs</h4>
<p>Lets start off with the not too special ones. Jake Raines and the flying mummy are great figures but pretty common. Mac McCloud is a great figure in the set. Identical to the one from 7306 except he has a dark tan kepi hat. Prof. Hale is an awesome figure that I am very surprised at. He has a rare tan handbag, hat, and has really neat prints. Amset-Ra is just too awesome to put into words. He has a nice, pearl gold headdress and if you flip his head he has a nice death mask. The Anubis warriors are possibly some of the best minifigs that TLG has ever produced. The minifigs score a 5/5 from me.</p>
<h4>Truck</h4>
<div>The truck is a beautiful part of this set. The treads are a very nice edition and it can seat all three adventurers. Equipped with a nice turret, these adventurers are ready to finish this quest once and for all!</div>
<h4>Scorpion</h4>
<p>The scorpion is another perfect part of this set. It is so huge you could make a $10 USD set for it. The best part about it is that there are no stickers. Yep, all good printed pieces for you.</p>
<h4>Pyramid front</h4>
<p>The Pyramid is built on the raised baseplate from 7627. You don't see many raised baseplates these days. The front has a few stickers but not many. We start on the left hand side. Farthest to the left is the obelisk. Looking a lot like the one from 7307, It falls over a lot but you can use it as an extra play feature. Next we have the snake pit. A part that I don't really get, you can use it for extra parts for the parts are very useful. After that we have the staircase. A very nice edition that can fold up to reveal a scorpion, hence the name. above the&nbsp;staircase&nbsp;is a nice, sliding door which has an&nbsp;Anubis&nbsp;face on it. A very nice edition also. Finally we get to the scorpion pit. Marked with a gravestone, the scorpion pit is pretty cool.</p>
<h4>Burial Tomb</h4>
<p>To the far, right hand corner is the Pharaohs burial chamber. Complete with&nbsp;Sarcophagus, the adventurers can blow up the wall with a stick of dynamite and open the Sarcophagus. his function works with a lever inside the Pyramid. The sarcophagus is a beautiful mold I'm glad to see back in production.</p>
<h4>Interior</h4>
<div>The interior is very nice and looks like a&nbsp;doll house. The side walls are created using SNOT (Studs Not On Top) and gives the interior a dark,&nbsp;wondrous&nbsp;feel to it. On the right is the Nemes holder. On the left is the lever to blow up the wall. Upstairs is another play feature that can make extra 2x1 dark tan bricks fall to crush any wandering adventurers.</div>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>I give this set a 5/5 because I can not give it a 10/5, which is what it truly deserves. This set makes me truly speechless, for it is far better then perfect. It has much playability because it has all those booby traps. I am glad that I picked this set up and I think it is appropriate for all ages. This is by far one of the best sets that Lego has ever made and I am very glad I picked this up. If the Pharaohs Quest line continues like this, I look forward to perhaps the greatest Lego line that they've produced.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"FanofLego","2011-03-14T18:44:03.833Z","An excellent set","<p>I was very excited when I heard about the Pharoh's Quest theme. I was hoping they would be as good as the Lego Adventurer's egypt subtheme. I am happy to say they are just as good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigs</p>
<p>The minifigures were great but it also should have come with Helana. I think Professer Hale should be in more sets since he started the quest in the first place. Jake Raines was in too many sets but I was happy he was included in this one. I liked all of the new minifigure outfits. Amset ra and the mummies were amazing. The wings on the flying mummy looked great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bricks, design, and play</p>
<p>The stickers were very nice and detailed&nbsp;but some of them should be printed bricks. But that would definitely raise the price of the set. I like how it included the specially modeled piece with the seats on it. Just like the old Adventurer's sets. There was a ton of the same bricks used. They should have chose some other colours or bricks to make it not only more interesting to build but to look at. There should have been more traps inside. The inside needed to be more detailed and a little&nbsp;bigger. It is really hard to play inside it and there's not really anything in there. There should have been some rooms you could fit your hand in. It should have come with coins and treasure pieces you could scatter around. The dynamite blowing up the door to amset ra was lame. You clip the dynamite there you have to go around the pyramid to push the lever&nbsp;to make it pop out. The dynamite should not be included in the function. The&nbsp;scorpion&nbsp;was really good but I found it a bit lazy the way it was built. But it looked excellent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all this was an amazing set and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I hope to see some Pharaoh's quest sets coming&nbsp;out soon because all are very well done.</p>
