"Duq","2011-01-17T17:42:33.697Z","There's no getting away from it, this is a police car!","<p>The <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8665-1"">Highway Enforcer from 2006</a> finally has an urban partner. Most Tiny Turbo Police cars have been part of a bigger set. This is only the second squad car on its own (third if you include <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7611-1"">7611</a>).</p><p>And a good looking car it is. Shorter than its Highway cousin and with smoother lines. The front looks tough with a bar above the grille and the back has a subtle spoiler. And with that black and white colour scheme and the red and blue lights you don't need the stickers to know it's a police car.</p><p>The building experience is nothing special; the typical Tiny Turbo concept of stacking plates and slopes with brackets front and back for bumpers and grilles. There's an interesting bunch of parts in this set. Because of the various colours you get a lot of spares; 7 round plates and cheese slopes. There's also two different mudguards, pretty wheels, tiles, 1x2 plates with rail and with bar and a 1x2 panel.</p><p>This is one of the best looking Tiny Turbo's and with all those parts it good value too.</p><p>(A little detail I noticed while building: the grille tile on the set picture above and on the box sits half a plate too far forward)<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,3,3,4
"legodude357","2011-04-11T21:56:34.187Z","A neat set.","I figure with sets like this, they would be a lot cheaper, (but not quite as fun!) if they were in a poly-bag or a box. The small plastic container is neat, but is also what you are probably paying the most for.<br><br>I recieved this as a surprise gift in my stocking for Christmas. I probably would never buy one of these sets because they seem expensive and have low value. The build was quick and easy, but interesting. Lego could have included a 1x2 piece to fill in a gap underneath the back windshield piece, which, btw, is a neat little piece, of which you receive two. The instructions were a folded up one page manual. I believe there is an alternative model for all of these little cars if you buy two and combine the other half of the instructions and the parts from each set. I love minifigures, and micro sets like these that include none are an automatic no-go for me. In the end it was an okay set, and had a few extra 1x1 transparent studs. You do have to apply stickers. I would not recommend this un;less your into the micro sets or the 'racers' line. Thanks for reading!<br><br><br>",TRUE,3,1,1,1,2
"Ernst","2011-12-30T14:59:31.17Z","Cool little Policecar","<p>Overall this set gets 5 bricks<strong>:</strong> this is a very nice Policecar to add to your City collection. Looks great, nice to built and good stickers. Comes in a plastic box so when taken apart easy to store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building&nbsp;3 bricks<strong>:</strong> it was my sons present but being a Lego fan I took it apart and rebuilt it, not too difficult but the result is solid. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts get&nbsp;4 bricks<strong>:</strong> Overall black rules but the white and blue bricks make it look great. The 4 x 2 bricks make it solid, the spoke wheels make it look great and dangerous. The 4 flashlights and the stickers give it a great finishing touch.&nbsp;Maybe a transparant front window would have been better?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks<strong>:</strong> great for every kid and drives like thunder !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks<strong>:</strong> Dutch retail price now â‚¬ 3,95, need I say more for this nice car ?</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
