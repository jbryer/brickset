The original was orange. <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8681-1"">Tuner garage</a> in 2006 had a yellow one, and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8154-1"">Brick Street Customs</a> in 2008 came with a grey version. This one then is lime with dark grey and white flames. For me the colour scheme just doesn't work.</p><p>Hot rod mk IV is slightly different from its predecessors; for the first time there are front mudguards and for the first time the engine is dark grey instead of metallic grey. Neither is an improvement. At least the grille still has its chrome outline.</p><p>The parts selection isn't bad with some tiles and jumpers in lime as well as the rounded top bricks and the mudguards but none of these parts are new in lime.</p><p>Even for a Tiny Turbo there's little SNOT in this build; only the two cheese slopes behind the engine. </p><p>All in all I'm disappointed with this set. We've seen it all before, only slightly better looking.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"fox171171","2011-06-20T21:58:58.22Z","Neat little car, very poor colour quality.","<p>A nice little hot rod. Pretty good for a small part count.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Not too bad looking, for a small model. Rolls well.<br></li><li>Some nice parts. Grille on the front is pretty cool, and could be useful elsewhere.<br></li><li>Doesn't look too bad without the stickers (though definitely plain).<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of stickers.<br></li><li>Colour issues.<br></li></ul>
<p>I bought this set to build for something to do for a few minutes, 
then to use for parts. Plus when my 3 month old gets old enough for 
LEGO, I'm sure he'll want some wheels to build with.</p><p>I'm happy 
with the pieces. I hate stickers, but never intended to use them, so it 
isn't too much of a bother for me, but others may be annoyed.</p>My 
main complaint is that the lime colour is not consistent. Similar 
pieces (two tiles for example) seem to be the same, but alongside other lime parts, they are clearly a slightly different shade. It is fairly obvious and looks really bad. This poor colour matching is why I gave a lower 
""overall rating"" than the other categories would suggest. (8304 suffers 
from this problem as well, but with the orange pieces, and not quite as obvious.)",TRUE,2,4,4,5,4
"Mask_of_Control","2019-08-26T15:57:14.077Z","This is a set with some problems!","<p>I received this set in 2011 and I think it&#39;s a average&nbsp;set.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>&raquo; Good addition to a Lego Racers Tiny Turbos collection.</p>

<p>&raquo; The play value is good although he depends a lot on the buyer&#39;s imagination and if he has more&nbsp;Tiny Turbos.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p>&raquo; The design of the set practically changed nothing from the others Hot Rods that came in other&nbsp;Tiny Turbos sets.</p>

<p>&raquo; The sets does not come with a piece of fire or water to make nitro like in the set 8641: Flame Glider&nbsp;and in the set 8681: Tuner garage.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>The set is a good despite not improving that much&nbsp;from his previous versions but I still think that is worth to buying it if you like Tiny Turbos or Hot Rods.</p>

<h2>Set score</h2>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>7.5/10</strong></p>
