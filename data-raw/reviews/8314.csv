That's about it I'm afraid. </p><p>The build is mostly typical for a Tiny Turbo with brackets front and back. The base is different though with stacks of round plates to raise the body. The bracket in front only holds a grille and seems to be missing a bumper or bull bar. The bracket at the back holds... nothing. No tail lights or any detailing, just bare studs.</p><p>Once it's built it just doesn't look right. The cheese slopes that dip the bonnet towards the windscreen, the tiles at the back sticking out over where the tail lights should have been. If it wasn't for the stickers it would be really plain. The colour scheme works and I like 'Slippy Racing Oil'.<br></p><p>The parts selection is quite plain; mostly plates. Only three tiles and a simple 2x4 slope for the cab. The inverted slope for the rear wheels is the only unusual part - for a Tiny Turbo... At 51 it also has one of the highest part counts of the series so value for money is good.<br></p><p>This truck just disappoints in every way. The looks, the lack of details and interesting parts... If you want to miss out on one Tiny Turbo this year make sure it's this one.</p>",TRUE,2,2,2,3,3
