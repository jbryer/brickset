While the stickers certainly add to the race car feel the design doesn't need stickers to look good - and that's always a good sign. It's not quite as good-looking as last years Blue Bullet but it's definitely in my top 3 of the past few years.</p><p>The design is similar to a number of the Le Mans type racers but this is the first open wheel Tiny Turbo outside of the off-roaders.<br></p><p>You'll find some nice parts in this set; three brackets, some tiles (a black 2x4) and grilles and two parts you rarely find outside the Tiny Turbo series; the spoiler part and that rounded wedge part that's used for the windows.</p><p>The imaginary team name 'Smell Zwell' must be one of the strangest names Lego has come up with. I wonder if this is a case of Donkey Kong (the famous translation mistake at Nintendo that gave the early video game classic its strange name)...</p><p>An interesting design built with interesting parts in nice colours. What's not to like?<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice car, for a small model. Rolls well.<br></li><li>Some nice parts.<br></li><li>Doesn't look too bad without the stickers.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of stickers.<br></li><li>Colour issues.<br></li></ul>
<p>I bought this set to build for something to do for a few minutes, then to use for parts. Plus when my 3 month old gets old enough for LEGO, I'm sure he'll want some wheels to build with.</p><p>I'm happy with the pieces. I hate stickers, but never intended to use them, so it isn't too much of a bother for me, but others may be annoyed.</p><p>My main complaint is that the orange colour is not consistent. Similar pieces (two tiles for example) seem to be the same, but the 1x2 grille is a slightly different shade than the 1x2 tile. The grille does seem to match the 1x4 tile. This poor colour matching is why I gave a lower ""overall rating"" than the other categories would suggest. (8302 suffers from this problem as well, but with the green pieces.)<br></p><p>I guess the car smells good, as the sticker says ""Smell Zwell"".<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,4,5,4
