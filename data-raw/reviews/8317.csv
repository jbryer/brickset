"antjtw","2011-01-01T13:08:14.59Z","Smashing Set!","<p>I eagerly&nbsp;anticipated&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;this set in the mail. It was one of those sets where I thought, I&#39;ll get that one, if I don&#39;t get any other set this year, that will be the one! I was not&nbsp;disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The set comes with:&nbsp;Battle Droids, Standard (x2),&nbsp;Super Battle Droid, Rocket Arm,&nbsp;Captain Rex, Luminari Unduli,&nbsp;BARC Speeder and the&nbsp;center-piece&nbsp;of the set, theDroid Proton Cannon.&nbsp;</div>

The devastating Separatist proton cannon leads the droid army in the greatest battle of&nbsp;Star Wars: The Clone Wars, with a missile launcher, adjustable turret and poseable legs. The Separatists seem unstoppable until Captain Rex and Jedi General Luminara Unduli arrive on the BARC speeder and turn the tide!&quot;</i></span></p>

<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I&#39;ll start with the speeder. The speeder is identical to the speeder in the 2011 Clone-Battle pack. However, the colour scheme is slightly modified, swapping the green pieces for shaded red pieces. The speeder itself is sturdy, strong is looks very nice. It&#39;s easy to hold, giving the speeder maximun playability.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The Proton Cannon is large, 9 inches tall, roundabout. The legs are posable, however, they cannot stay up when raised. They can rotated, around the model to gain different stances. The legs can be raised for walking, &nbsp;but will not stay in the air once released. The control which pivots the cannon is on the front, it does look rather sore, however a small modification, by moving it to the back, which is very simple, fixes this problem. The upper-cannon is sturdy and looks nice, with a external cockpit on the left of the model to fit a droid. The turret of the cannon is also sturdy and nice looking. The build level is moderate.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Figures. The battle droids are nothing&nbsp;particular&nbsp;special, however the Super Battle droid has only appeared in 1 or 2 other sets, making it rather rare. Captain Rex, who&#39;s appeared in one other set, the now dis-continued AT-TE, 2008. Making his figure also very rare. The set also contains the Lego-Debuting Luminari Unduli, who comes&nbsp;equip&nbsp;with a double-sided head, one normal, the other with a printed visor. She also comes with a green light-sabre.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Overall, I&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;you but the set if you have the money, if you don&#39;t I don&#39;t recommend saving up, buy a battle pack and the figures from Bricklink or eBay.&nbsp;</div>

"CapnRex101","2011-01-02T07:00:31.857Z","7869 - Battle For Geonosis","<p>This was a set I was excited to get, and it certainly did not disappoint, both the Minifigures and the models are excellent, and that is a winning combination.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art for all of the recent Star Wars sets has been very eye catching, and that is what it is there for, to draw your eye onto the product, so that you may buy it. This picture shows the turret firing a missile at the approaching Luminara Unduli, who is riding a BARC speeder. Captain Rex is taking on a battle droid and a super battle droid with his twin pistols. Things are exploding all around and the background is of course of Geonosis. A downed Trade Federation Coreship is smouldering at the back of the action.</p><p>The instructions were fine with no mistakes and I had no missing pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are several nice new parts in this set, the most obvious of which is Luminara's headdress, it is not entirely new as it is the same piece as used in the Wookiee Catamaran set from 2005, Luminara also appeared in that set as a Light Up Lightsaber figure. The printing on her torso and legs is very nice, with a lot of detail. There is also a dark grey barrel, which I have not seen before and the two large quarter circle slope pieces used in the Slave 1 and the Grand Emporium. As well as all that we also get a translucent gearbox piece, which is not exceedingly rare, but nice to have all the same.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are five Minifigures included in this set. We get two normal battle droids who are always nice, a super battle droid with rocket launcher arm, who is fairly rare as he has only appeared in the AAT set from 2008 before now, Captain Rex who is nice for anyone who missed out on the AT-TE set from 2007, which was the only set to have included him previously and of course Luminara Unduli, who is an enormous improvement on her Minifigure from 2005. The detail on her torso is amazing with some intricate areas of necklace, and even some fold lines in her dress. The legs are also great with her trademark sash well recreated. Her face is very good, with purple lips and blue eyes, however she has a double sided face, on the other side is her wearing the goggles we see in the season two episode 'Legacy of Terror'. Which is a nice touch.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was quite easy, it took about twenty to thirty minutes for me, the build was quite a good one, using a couple of interesting building techniques. There were a couple of Technic elements which could pose a problem for younger children, but very little, so it shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Altogether I love the set, like Mace Windu's Jedi Starfighter the set could be used to create a good even battle by itself or with other models as well, I like the inclusion of the BARC speeder which is identical to the BARC speeder in the Clone Trooper Battle Pack apart from the colours, basically any piece in green in the Clone Trooper Battle Pack is in dark red here. They look good together with a clone riding the green speeder and a Jedi riding the red one.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I love this set, sadly though I am not quite going to give it full marks as I think the price is a little bit too steep for what you get, but I would still&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;it to anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"Kalhiki","2011-09-13T21:00:49.593Z","What, no Geonosians?","<p>Well, TRU was having sales, so I got this set (plus I got a free R2-D2 USB which is cool). Before I start, I'm kinda regretting I got this set. I got it for 30 to 35 dollars, which is a good price, but I feel I would have been happier if I got the Ninjago Earth Dragon Defense set. Oh well!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is nice and features the set in realistic glory. There is no cheating on the picture, so the poses can be pulled off. And as usual, the back features the set's functions.</p>
<p>Inside you get three bags of parts and one instruction book. The instructions cover the minifig builds and speeder bike (bag 1), the legs of the cannon (bag 2), and the main cannon (bag 3). </p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts are pretty good. I like the greys wich would come in handy for building mechs and whatnot. Plus, on each leg there is a cool cylinder/piston thingamabob. I didn't know these existed, and didn't see they were on the set, so this was a nice surprise. I also like the clear gearbox.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>We get five minifigs in the set (well, four since you get two identical Battle Droids). I'll go least favorite to favorite.</p>
<p>Battle Droids: Average Battle Droids. Nothing to go over</p>
<p>Super BD: Average Super. Nothing to go over. Though he does have a neat gun arm, but this was in other sets.</p>
<p>Luminara: She's actually a pretty nice figure. The legs and the body prints are very detailed and from what I remember from the show (I haven't seen many episodes), it's pretty accurate. The face is kinda... eh. I guess I'm used to the movie figures and not the cartoon faces. Still, it's pretty nice. Also, the face is double sided, the flip side having goggles or something. The hat also is pretty cool looking as well.</p>
<p>Captain Rex: Surprisingly my fav. I love the look of Clone Troopers and now that Lego has given them armor, it's even better. The overall design is a basic clone, but he has shoulder pads, a waist guard-not-skirt, an antenna, and two pistols. And, he too has the silly cartoon face which is detailed, but eh to me. But it's nice to see he's got some stubble.</p>
<p>Geonosian: Oh wait! There isn't one! What? This is the Battle for Geonosis, and you don't give us any Geonosians? Come on...</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build was rather simplistic. Speeder was a speeder. Not much.&nbsp;The gearbox on the cannon&nbsp;was one of few interesting things in the build along with the cannon (the one that fires). The only part I had trouble on was connecting the side panels on the main cannon, but that was mainly because I didn't have it aligned properly. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Let's do the Speeder. I like it overall. The side fins are cool, and I love the sleek look to it. I particularly like the middle fin on the back. But, I have to mark it down. From what I've heard, this is the same speeder from a certain battle pack (not sure which). So, it's kinda cheap on Lego's part to include an identical design in a different set.</p>
<p>The cannon is the main meat. It's very sturdy, and the gear function adds nice playability (along with the firing missle). The design is gorgeous, and I love the triple launcher design (main cannon and two red cannons). Plus, it's&nbsp;got legs, so it's a big, walking cannon.</p>
<p>But problems. The legs are just... I don't know. They're out at weird angles and remind me of a turtle. The only upsides to them are the kneepads and cylinders. I just think they could have been better. As for the gun, it's nice looking, but has a big, gaping hole on the side. And sadly, it's on the outward facing side (the side without the pilot seat). It has a nice cover on the&nbsp;other side, so I don't know why&nbsp;that choice was made. But other than that, it's fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, I really don't recommend this set. Not for the actual price. I'd definitely wait for a sale and get it then. But even still, I'd only pay 30 bucks or less. Otherwise, it's just not worth it. It gets some points for not having stickers, so that's good. The only reason why it gets a four out of five is because it's a good set, but probably only for avid SW collectors. I'm not really one anymore, so I'm a little dissapointed I didn't get something else, but for you SW collectors, if you can find it on sale, maybe consider it.</p>
<p>To the Star Wars collector: 4/5</p>
<p>To Everyone else: 3/5</p>
<p>(I guess it's mostly the price that's been making me regret this.)</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,3
"legos","2013-11-14T21:06:55.593Z","Battle of Geonosis: The best set yet?","<p>I bought this set back when it came out, and I was thrilled with the whole experience, even the price, which is not something I'd normally say of Lego Star Wars. I think the main reason I got this set was the cannon. The classic (Well not that classic, this is the prequel we are talking about!) Geonosian cannon was a must have for me, and when I saw the minifigures, I was thrilled.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Minifigures: Captain Rex, Luminara Unduli, and two droids?

All of the grey pieces are awesome.</li><li></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>BARC speeder: The speeder itself is not the problem, but I think Lego threw this in so they could raise the price</li><li>Price: $50.00 for a cannon and 4 minifigs? I don't think so.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This set was great, and a good addition to any Star Wars fans collection. Playability, parts, and minifigs are great, but the price and BARC speeder are disappointing. Overall, a great set! I recommend you buy this while you still can!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
"Huge_Nerd","2011-11-12T08:02:18.487Z","It's a Battle!","I got this on sale at TRU a while back. Having acquired the Geonosian Starfighter and looking forward to the upcoming 2012 Geonosian Canon and battlepack, I thought this would make a great addition to a Geonosian battle display--and it does!<br><br>The Proton Cannon droid is the centerpiece--and a worthy centerpiece it is. The build was an interesting mix of traditional and Techic style elements. The resulting model is a really nice, large size and the different shades of gray surprisingly are not boring. The highlights of blue and red add to its visual appeal. The legs are very poseable, and the piston system looks and works quite well. Unlike what others have mentioned, the legs on mine stay posed however I place them. I currently have the front left leg and back right leg raised as if it is walking and they stay up just fine--it still balances great on two feet too! The gear box is a nice touch and a good playability feature. Since this droid is more like a mortar launcher, howitzer, or ""rail gun"" it feels like a weapon that would be calibrated and aimed in such a manner based on precise degree measurements (calculated by the battle droid on the little pilot platform). Again, unlike other reviewers, I left the knob in the front since that allows for more range of movement than modding it to the back. Finally, the spring-loaded missile launch is super-powerful so watch out!<br><br>Next is the BARC Speeder. This is my first experience with this kind of speeder and I was pleasantly surprised. The speeder is very sleek and swooshable, and feels much more hefty and solid than traditional Endor style bikes. The build is also less of a cheat than the other bikes (it doesn't have that pre-formed bike piece). The brick-red pieces are very stunning in color.<br><br>Finally, you get a nice array of minifigs. The two battle droids are standard, but one can never have too many of them! The super-battle droid is big and solid-feeling with a nice cannon arm and a cool gun-metal color. Luminara has nice front and leg printing, a nice headdress, a head with a unique skin-color with two colorful faces. I have her riding the speeder with her visor face forward holding her green light saber aloft! Last but not least is Captain Rex. He's a standard clone, but with five o'clock shadow on his face and blue details on his armor. His colors ""pop"" much more than I expected--and much moreso that Commander Cody from other sets (who I expected to like better, but Rex won me over). He comes with the gray clone gear so you can give him his signature look.<br><br>I find the MSRP price to be quite fair. You get a large main model plus essentially a battle pack which are all very playable as a self-contained set or mixed with others. If you get it on sale like me, however, all the better!<br><br><br>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"Stromeon","2011-12-23T12:38:32.453Z","Nice battle set!","<p>This is a really good set to pick up if you want to recreate some Clone Wars action. Although it is from the Battle of Geonosis, all the parts of the set wouldn't look out of place in other Clone Wars battlefields. While the cannon does not fire from the barrel, a technic piece with a rubber bit on the end comes out from underneath the barrel when you press a red technic piece at the back. You can also adjust where the cannon is aiming by twiddling a little knob at the bottom on the front. The cannon is GREAT for playability as you can have endless amounts of fun trying to get your aim right to knock minifigs over by firing the cannon. The minifigs are also good, the captain Rex is very good. The BARC speeder is exactly the same as in the Clone Trooper Battle pack, but just with a slight brown colour scheme</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The cannon is amazing - soooo much better than flick-fire missiles, if shot with venom, the technic piece can fly across a room at a high velocity</li><li>Luminara has a two-sided head, a normal one and one with goggles on it to shield her eyes from the dust or something</li><li>A Super Battle Droid is included, seemingly rather rare these days</li><li>One of the few sets that gives an OK balance between the two sides, some sets like the Jedi shuttle - 4 Jedi vs... nothing... - here we have three droids and a cannon vs a Jedi and a clone and a bike</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Battle of Geonosis set, so there are ... wait... no Geonosians ?!?!</li><li>The seat on the cannon which the droid sits on has no studs, so the droid is liable to fall off. You can just put a studded piece in there and that solves the problem</li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>If you combine this set with the soon-to-be-released Geonosian cannon (which has Geonosians in it) then that gives you the base for a good battle of Geonosis scene. The cannon is just so cool in this one though :D</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
