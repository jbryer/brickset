The clone commander is fantastic. He has an awesome, almost transparent green/yellow color scheme which looks amazing. The 2 bomb squad troopers are perfect as well. The have an eye-popping hot orange color that also has a semi-transparent look to it. And the ARF trooper- INCREDIBLE! This has to be my favorite clone figure of ALL time.

"CapnRex101","2010-12-29T15:54:28.297Z","7913 - Clone Trooper Battle Pack","<p>This set is absolutely incredible in every way, from the figures to the speeder, I love it all!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box for the set features the BARC speeder surrounded by Clone troopers on a sort of jungle background. Laser blasts are all around, presumably from some droids or possibly the new Mandalorians.</p><p>The instructions are just fine, no errors or missing pieces for me!</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts for this set are excellent, especially the parts which make up the wonderful figures, the ARF trooper helmet is a new mould and the other three helmets have all got brand new printing! The speeder is made up of some very nice parts, such as the ski pieces which form the four sections of armour plating (if that is what they are) protecting the blasters and the engines.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Well now, this is where the set comes together spectacularly. All the figures in the set are fantastic. I will start with the brilliant ARF trooper, the helmet design is really spectacular, better than that of Arealight in my opinion. The printing is spot on and looks really nice. The Clone trooper is in fact from Horn Company led by Captain Lock under the command of&nbsp;Jedi&nbsp;general Eeth Koth, they appear in the season two episode 'Grievous Intrigue' and the figure looks very accurate to it's brief appearance in the TV show. This figure includes leg printing unlike most Clone figures, as does the Bomb Squad trooper figure. This figure has a very nice helmet (which is interestingly orange with white printing and not the other way around) which looks just like the helmet of the Bomb Squad trooper from the season one episodes 'Blue Shadow Virus' and 'Mystery of a Thousand Moons' as does the torso and leg printing. And just to sweeten the deal, you get two of these!</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very quick and easy, it takes between five and ten minutes and contains no difficult or particularly interesting building techniques.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The figures as I so emphatically stressed are excellent, but so is the speeder, it is predominantly white but also includes some green and dark grey parts. It is very accurate to both the bikes seen in Revenge of the Sith and those seen in the Clone Wars. I prefer this bike to the one which appears in the Republic Gunship set from 2008.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall as you may have guessed I absolutely adore this set,&nbsp;everything&nbsp;about it is perfect and I will&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;be buying multiples of this set to bolster my Clone army.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box has the Captain Rex Logo on it and shows 4 all new minifigs on the front. On the back, it shows this battle pack an battle with the Mandolorian Battle Pack(which I will get). The instructions show the new Lego Star Wars Winter sets.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are nice and I count the minifig parts in the rating.There are 2 Lego Atlantis Spear Guns in this set. There was 1 extra piece and that was a black bent droid arm.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs make this set amesome! All of them are new. You get a new ARF Trooper. Unfortunetly, the only thing new about him is his helmet, but the helmet is the best one I've ever seen. You can turn it 360 degrees. It has tons of details. The new Clone Commando(on the box it says clone trooper) has green printed legs, green printed body, and a green printed helmet. It also has 2 new commando pistols (the set also has 2 blaster rifles and 1 blaster pistol). Lastly, you get 2 new Bomb Squad Troopers. They both have legs, arms, bodies, and helmets that are printed orange.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>There nothing important really about the build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The Speeder Bike has some&nbsp;nice colors (green and white) and looks very cool with the Clone Commando on it.</p>

The first one is adorned in green markings. Two others are a nice orange color and deviate from the typical mostly white clone trooper. The final trooper has a standard body, but his helmet is different. It's a more complex version of the helmets worn by the Endor troopers.

These clones seem to be a bit more ""niche"" than the clones in the last clone battle pack, but that does not make them any less awesome.</SPAN></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Speeder Bike is Excellent 
<li>The decoration on the Clone Troopers is Fantastic 
<li>An ARF Trooper has finally been made!, though he lacks leg printing for some reason... 
<li>These minifigs allow one with a standing Clone Army to flesh out their ranks with some specialists</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>

<li>The leg printing on the clones in this set is a pro of course, but the ARF trooper and the older&nbsp;CW&nbsp;clones now look&nbsp;like they are missing something when&nbsp;they are put with the other new clones in this set due to the amazing decoration on the Bomb Squad Troopers and the Green Clone. 
<li>As I stated above, these clones are much more ""niche"" and specialized than the ones in the last clone battle pack (8014). Depending on where you are in the fan spectrum, this can either be a pro or a con. In terms of serving as an army builder, this set seems to be better suited to adding a bit of flavor to a standing clone army, while 8014 (the Clone Walker Battle Pack from 2009) makes a better bulk army bulder. One could even use the ARF trooper in the walker from that set! 
<li>A little expensive: $12 for me </li></ul>

<p>Here's a hint though people at Lego...when deciding what mini-figs to put in these battle packs&nbsp;it's always nice when you include at least 3&nbsp;of the most common type contained in an army which gives your customers incentives to buy more in order to build up big armies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I bought&nbsp;multiple sets&nbsp;of the old clone trooper and stormtrooper&nbsp;battle packs because&nbsp;they had 3 common troopers each.&nbsp; Heck,&nbsp;I bought 7&nbsp;of the clone trooper&nbsp;sets and I'll probably buy that&nbsp;many of the Mandaloran sets.&nbsp; But with this set I'll probably get only one because&nbsp;I don't really need an entire platoon of bomb disposal troopers.&nbsp; If you had instead included one bomb trooper and 3 of either of the other types I would have bought a ton of these things.&nbsp; Just something to consider...</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,3

<p>I find the clone&nbsp;minifigs wanting, especially the helmets: they're too simple, in my opinion. I can live with the faces, though. And I'm not a big&nbsp;fan of the Clone Wars series as well.</p>
<p>But then, adding color and prints to the rest of the figs in this set&nbsp;gave me a big surprise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The</strong>&nbsp;<strong>gem</strong> <strong>of the lot</strong>:<strong> the ARF trooper!</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You just got to love the mold of the helmet. Mine had slight misprints on the mouth part (which hapens to a lot, as I have acquired new, loose figures of these babies), but that didn't dampen my enthusiasm for this thing. I really wish they placed 2 of these instead of the bomb squad troopers. You can't have enough of them, in my opinion. And whatever the rest of it's body lacks in terms of prints and colors, it makes up for with its helmet. Although this makes me want to swap the heads with the clone commander's, and you do get a more awesome fig which adds to the playability. I do pity him for not being the one assigned to ride the bike! AND even if he belongs to the clone wars, I'd be more than happy to put him side-by-side with the OT Stormies and scout troopers any day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The set also comes with two bomb squad troopers. The orange&nbsp;color give them such distinctive features, that seem to say, ""we are here!"", so that they should be easily sighted and be shot at (can we blame the&nbsp;republic for that?). Bomb disposal is another matter, though. Kidding aside, overall they are visually impressive, but I just do not agree with the colors for the roles. But these would be great for customization. The prints on the legs make up for a lot good points&nbsp;. The colors make them nice for display, as it easily catches the eye! ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clone trooper commander also shows what additional colors and prints can do to improve appearance. I only wish that they fitted him at least with a rangefinder. I do like the touch of green on this thing, and the guns provided are an improvement from&nbsp;that of the previous battle pack. Prints on its legs are also a good addition. Add a pauldron and a kama and, ""voila""! Another great customization piece!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SPEEDER BIKE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The speeder bike is awesome, to say the least. It was a delight to build for me and the instructions are&nbsp;very direct. If there were choppers in the empire, this could be one of those. It's big, bad (in the good sense) and well designed! Everything fits in just right.&nbsp;It's very swooshable (at a lower altitude, of course!) and also aesthetically pleasing, as the newer designs of the vehicles seem to be becoming.The parts used are also a plus factor as&nbsp;most have a great degree of usability in other builds, if you consider such things.&nbsp;I give this also a big playability factor.</p>

<p>The speeder. Ummmm...... It is really cool. Pretty good design and fun to build. Although as expected its just basically stacking plates then a few details.

The ARF trooper is now the leader of my two imperial scout troopers from the Battle of Endor&nbsp;set. &nbsp;Also, with the release with the Geonosian Starfighter around the corner, that commander cody figure can be the leader of the two orange clones. Who are supposed to be bomb squad. The last figure is what I've been told, is an 'Eth Coth Trooper'. Sorry for the spelling. He has double printed torso and printed legs! I put these legs and torso on the Arf trooper and it looks amazing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set yoyu will defeintly buy, because it is one of the cheaper sets of 2011. I think that the price can be lowered $3. I plan on buying many multiples of this set. But the mando battle pack, you should only get two of. Really you dont need more than eight mandos and maybe a boba fett to lead them. I would reccomend this to all Lego fans!</p>

Though I’m not a big fan of the Star Wars prequels, or the “Clone Wars” TV show, I have to admit that Lego does a phenomenal job creating Lego sets designed around them. The new Clone Troopers battle pack is a useful army builder to anyone who collects Lego Star Wars characters.

"Firox_5000","2012-01-07T16:06:21.09Z","New Clones ","<p>I bought this set shortly after it came out from Lego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set contains 85 pieces and is very easy and quick to build which should take around 10-15 minutes at the most. </p>
<p>The set when completes consists of four clones and a speeder. The Clone figure are very well printed and I think the orange squad troopers are done very well. The sand green clone is also a nice addition as to is the bomb trooper adding some nice variation that the first clone battle pack did not really have. </p>
<p>The speeder is also a rather nice addition differening from the old mini walker from the 2009 one. It does the job well with colouring and appearance but is more of a supporter to the set to the figures to add playability, excitement and value. </p>
<p>The set contains several unique parts and colourings all on the clone troopers such as the orange printing and helmets on the bomb squad troopers, the turquise printing on the sand green clone trooper and the somewhat classic/clone cross in the&nbsp; ARF trooper. Apart from that, all the other parts in the set are mostly common in other sets. </p>
<p>The playability of the set on it's own is quite durable however if you own the Mandalorian battle pack then the set has greater abilities of play value due to the opposing sides of a battle field.</p>
<p>This set is fantastic for the figures and it's low price tag offering many fans of lego to stock up on several of these for their collection and also it's unique figures. </p>
<p>There is nothing much I can complain about this set at all. The price I bought it at was £9.99 which at the time was quite good value. However to reflect the recent hike in this years battle packs the price has had a 20% hike of £2 making the current price of it now £11.99. </p>
<p>I very strongly recommend this set especially for all star wars fans, army builders and those who like clone trooper but dont like star wars. However for £12 a pack, I suggest where possible to buy them slightly reduced as it's previous price at £10 was much more reasonable. </p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4

<li>ARF trooper is great! His helmet is super cool, and can completely rotate unlike the Scout-Troopers helmet from the Battle Of Endor and other sets. The helmet also has pretty cool printing.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box is the standard battle pack size that we've all come to know with the usual Captain Rex box art showing the set in it's 'action' pose, along with the near essential explosions and blaster lasers. The instructions were clear (as always) and no mistakes as far as I could see; all the parts were in the box.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Speaking of parts, there are a couple of nice pieces, my favourite being the cool gun pieces that lie on the top of the engines. Other than that, there is nothing of real importance to mention other than the ski parts that attach to the sides.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>The minifigures are the main draw in my opinion. They are superb! The set comes with four brand new minifigs (at the time of release); a clone commander who comes with two great blaster pistols and green stylings, an ARF trooper with an AWESOME helmet piece (Great job by Lego here!) but a regular clone body and legs, and two bomb squad troopers, who look really good. Four real nice minifigs here, so great for those building up an army or squadron.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>Nothing to say here but really simple and not challengng in any way, but young children might get some building fun from it.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The speeder looks really nice and can hold a minifig with ease. I don't know whether it is from the clone wars or if it is just a Lego random creation, but it's cool either way. It looks really fit for duty when the ARF tropper is riding it, though, so look out droids (or Mandalorians for 2011)!</p>

And what better sets to leave until the end than 2011's Battle Packs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set scores fairly high, while admittedly there is only one model to build, which is typical of LEGO Battle Packs, we get a lot of great items included in the set. To start off we'll mention the model, this is a BARC Speeder build, it is similar to other designs of the BARC speeder found in recent Star Wars sets. It makes however for a simple, fast build with some great design choices for the detail of the BARC, compared to older Speeders which were lacking in decent piece numbers used and details carried over from official media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is great for playing with and makes for a decent addition to the Vehicles your Kids or Diorama MOCer enthusiast AFOLs enjoy to make so much. It isn't as cluttered as the miniature Imperial Dropship from the 2009(?) Stormtrooper/Shadow Trooper battle pack, so you can easily hold onto it and swish it around.</p>

<p>Now for the Mini-Figures. These four are impressive, you have great printed detailing on the Clones, in different and unique colors. We also get a brand new style of helmet with the ARF Trooper. Aesthetically these four Mini-Figures fit in with Clone Wars displays/collections, however they'll look great added in with any clone army.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two Bomb Squad Troopers include new orange coloring, which makes some fun new printing and great troop buildable mini-figs. All four of the Clones have the exact same head, we also get more of the same Clone affiliated accessories we've seen in past sets. Two small pistols for the BARC Speeder Pilot, two long blaster rifles and an ordinary blaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All four of these Clones include back printing, if memory serves, and the bomb squad troopers have leg printing. Overall this is a must own set, and a perfect one for clone enthusiasts to buy multiples of. I rate it a solid five out of five, with exception to the build, which gets three out of five only because you aren't building much and if you collect a lot of Star Wars sets you'll have built a few of these BARC speeders before. I strongly reccomend this set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"AT_TE_is_so_cool","2013-10-06T18:05:11.91Z","Bomb Squad troopers are amazing.","&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So far, this is one of the best battle packs if you are looking for good clone troopers, but is not the best if you are looking for a good vehicle. I would give the building experience two bricks because, there is a total of 85 pieces in this set, so there is only a little lego could let the speeder actually do. The minifigures are amazing, which include an ARF trooper, a horn company commander, and two AMAZING Bomb Squad troopers, which made me super happy. The only special parts found in the set are the two harpoon guns that make up the speeder's blasters, and the ARF trooper's helmet piece. But the printing for the figure's torsos and leg pieces make up for the lack of special parts included. The playability of the set is not that high, because the speeder can't really do much, which is probably one of the only faults in the set. I think the money is a small price to pay for this set, and I think it is worth every cent. All in all, I think this is a great set to have so you can grow your clone army and is a must get set from 2011. I definitely recommend this set for all Star Wars fans and clone wars lovers.",FALSE,5,4,2,3,5

<p>&nbsp;Minifigures;</p>

<p>&nbsp; ARF trooper this is the first LEGO ARF trooper. His helmet is a specially moulded piece with blue and green markings. His torso is printed with regular clone armour printing and plain white legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Horn Company Commander he has sand green markings on his helmet and his torso with a stylised bull in lime green on his torso. With armour printing and sand green highlights.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Two Bomb Squad troopers. They have orange helmets with a white diamond pattern on the faceplate. With orange and white printed on their legs and torsos.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The only build in this set is a speeder bike for the clones to ride. This scale&nbsp;of a BARC speeder is my favourite version. The speeder is white with green markings. Overall it is a great set.</p>
