However unlike the Clone Trooper Battle Pack, there is only one type of minifigure in this set: the Mandalorian Death Watch Soldier. Although this does mark it down a bit in my opinion, the Mandalorian is still a very good minifigure, and you can easily make a Jango Fett MOC using their pieces. The jetpacks are the same as the ones on the Clones in the Corporate Alliance Tank Droid but grey instead of white, and the helmets are the same as Boba Fett's in the most recent Slave I but grey and blue instead of green and dark red. The rifle/turret is pretty cool too, and is easy for a minifigure to hold.</div><div><br></div><h4>Speeder</h4><div><br></div><div>The Mandalorian Speeder is pretty cool, and is very accurate to its Clone Wars appearance.

"AETerry","2011-01-04T22:28:09.97Z","Mandalorian Review","<p>It's not very often that Lego Star Wars has a compelling set that gets my interest. I didn't just buy one, I bought two sets of this and I may, as part of army building, buy more as the year progresses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4 minifigures are the Mandalorian Death Watch Soldiers, which I guess appear in the Clone Wars t.v. series. That explains the styling of their faces. And a good thing they have those snazzy blue Mandalorian helmets, otherwise they look highly sleep deprived and angry about it too. They feature a blue &amp; grey coloring scheme for their armor, grey backpacks and each of them has at least one weapon they can carry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I go onto the rest of the set, I should mention one of the weapons carried is that classic video camera/bazooka piece with a minibuild for it so it's a tripod heavy laser cannon. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Speeder Bike is&nbsp;a solid little build with a clear brick underneath to give the illusion it's hovering. Complementing the Mandalorians, it too is a blue &amp; grey design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finishing out this set is a Weapons Turrent, also a blue &amp; grey design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As someone who isn't all -that- familiar with every nuance of Star Wars or LEGO Star Wars, this is a great and wonderful little set. Obviously, if you've been collecting, just starting out, pick up random sets here and there... this set is well worth picking up.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"CapnRex101","2010-12-29T17:51:09.99Z","7914 - Mandalorian Battle Pack","<p>This is another brilliant&nbsp;offering&nbsp;from the January 2011 wave of Lego Star Wars, not quite as good as the Clone Trooper Battle Pack but still very good indeed.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art for this set is spectacular much like that of the Clone Trooper Battle Pack with the turret and speeder surrounded by Mandalorians and blaster fire. The box is the same size as all of the other battle packs as you might expect.</p><p>The instructions are faultless, as usual, and I had no missing pieces, in fact I had an extra Mandalorian helmet!</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some nice pieces in this set such as of course the Mandalorian helmet (which with just a single sticker could be turned into that of Pre Vizsla) which you get four of or in my case five! The piece which connects the barrel of the turret to the stand may be a new&nbsp;piece&nbsp;as although I have not seen it in a set before, it could well be a piece I have simply not noticed. This set also includes some new pistols, these are basically the old pistols which came with the ARC trooper armour crossed with the basic short Star Wars blaster. They also appear in the Bounty Hunter Gunship and the new Clone Trooper Battle Pack.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Minifigures in this set are the stand out feature for me! The helmets are very good and are very accurate to those seen in the television show. The torso printing is quite good and features a fair amount of detail as well. The jetpack is the same piece as seen in the Corporate Alliance Tank Droid but has been recoloured in dark grey.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build for this set is very short taking only five to ten minutes like the Clone Trooper Battle Pack. The build is very straightforward and easy, and utilises no new or interesting building techniques as far as I can see.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Overall the model looks brilliant. The light turret looks really good, and could double as a chain gun or rotary cannon (still holding out for a piece for that). The heavier turret also looks quite good but perhaps needs something else at the front instead of just that blue piece. It just makes the armour look a bit weak. The speeder is lovely, very accurate to the episodes it appears in and very well designed.But it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the figures that take the set up a level.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I feel this set could do with a couple of touches here and there but even without any modifications this is really a wonderful set. I think it would make a nice small gift for any Lego or Star Wars fan (including yourself) and would advise people to buy it. I hope to get a couple more of these and create a small Death Watch army to take on the might of the Republic and their valiant Clone troopers.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

It took only 5 minutes or so to build, but I feel this set added plenty to my collection - excellent value for money. Run fast and shoot straight!<br>",TRUE,4,5,1,5,5
"sudorum","2011-02-09T20:30:33.76Z","Jango Fett Served Four Ways","This is the first and only battle pack I truly wanted the first time I heard of it. The fact that it was going to feature mandalorians instead of clones or rebels signified to me a much needed change. The only disappointing aspect about this battle pack is that all of the mandalorians are the same color. Also, they are very close resemblances to what an improved version of Jango Fett would look like. As in all battle packs, the minifigures are the center of the set. The turret and the strange vehicle neither hinder, nor help the set. They're just kind of there.&nbsp;",FALSE,3,4,1,1,4
"Brickmeister1138","2011-01-24T22:24:25.05Z","When Battle Droids are not enough, it is time to send in the Mando'ade!","<p>This set is epic.&nbsp;It finally gives one the ability to add some Mandos to a Lego battle scene that are NOT based on parts lifted&nbsp;from a&nbsp;Boba or Jango minifigure. This set, like the Clone Battle Pack, is compsoed of multiple elements:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mandalorians: In the Star Wars Universe, there are few forces more feared than the Mandalorian Supercommandos, and Lego has certainly given them justice in this set. The details are fantastic, and Lego even captured the intimidating look of the Mandalorian Armor (or beskar'gam if you are a Star Wars fan). Though the thing that puzzles me with this battle pack is the fact that the Mandos appear to be Clones. I do find it ironic that the CLONE TROOPER battle pack's troopers had more individuality than the Mandalorians in this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Speeder: The speeder captures the look of the speeder used by Obi Wan and Duchess Satine in ""The Mandalore Plot"" episode of the Clone Wars. It is a simple build, but it was a simple speeder in the episode, so I have no compliants. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cannon + Repeater Rifle: These features of the set add to the playability, but are of little use to one going for movie accuracy. These componenets of the set are average, and I found them to be of little use.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Mandalorians Look Awesome! 
<li>The Speeder is movie accurateand well built 
<li>4 Jet Packs 
<li>The face on the mandos (though repeated) is well done and is easily useable elsewhere (it makes a great head for an Imperial Officer)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Mandalorians appear to be clones, some individuality like in the Hoth Battle Packs would have been nice. 
<li>A commander (Governor Vizsla for example) with different armor would have been Welcome 
<li>The Cannon and Repeater Blaster are a little silly 
<li>A little Expensive 
<li></li></ul>
<p>This set, despite its slight flaws, is very well made and is truly a sight to behold. It is a must have for any Star Wars fan, and is an excellent Mandalorian Armor source (Mandalorian armor is the height of fashion amongst mercenaries and bounty hunters)&nbsp;and&nbsp;army builder. Overall I give this set a 4.75/5. The .25 was taken off because Mandos are not supposed to be clones.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,4

<h4>Parts</h4>Set contains 68 pieces, no new pieces, most of them are in blue and grey, nothing special on them<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>4 mandalorians, they all look same, but they are very good designed, torso has printing on only one side, but that's not problem 'cause jetpack covers their back. Helmets are same like new Boba Fett's only in different color. Only bad thing about figures are their faces-they are ugly, even worse than clone faces
<h4>The build</h4>Nothing special.. very easy to build, 5 min. max.
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The speeder is kinda stupid, it's too small, but it can maybe be useful in MOCs</p><p>Small turret is is pretty cool, it's very useful in almost every SW MOC, it can be attached to Mandalorian hand</p><p>Big turrent is also great, simple but nicely designed, it's also very useful in MOCs<br></p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box has the Captian Rex logo on it and shows off the set and the 4 new mandos. And on the back, it shows this set in battle with Set #7913(The Clone Trooper Battle Pack). The instructions show all the new Lego Star Wars Sets from the 2011 Winter Line.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>You get a cool Mixture of blue and gray pieces in this set which is very nice. There is a new Machine gun turret design for one of the Mandos as well. I count the minifigure parts in the rating.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The 4 Mandalorians&nbsp;are very cool. You can easily customize one of them as Jango Fett, Pre Vizla, or any other Mando that comes to mind. Besides the new machine gun for one of the&nbsp;Mandos, you also get a blaster pistol, blaster rifle, and 2 new commando pistols.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is about 5 minutes long and not very hard.</p>

<h4>The Build.&nbsp; (5/5)</h4>
<p>The build was extremely easy, for it took 4.5 minutes to build with no mistakes in the instructions. </p>
<h4>The Parts.&nbsp; (5/5)</h4>
<p>I do like the blue parts in the set. You also get two wings pieces and nice scopes and a clear piece.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>The Minifigures.&nbsp; (5/5)</h4>
<p>You&nbsp;get 4 Mandalorians which are excellent blue figures with no back printing.&nbsp; They have great mold and printing for helmet.&nbsp; They have a gray single jetpack and a good detailed torso.&nbsp; The long gun, small gun, two small pistols, and a very cleverly-designed machine gun come with these guys.&nbsp; These minifigures will go for $5-$15 each and $15 to $20 for 4 of each online.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>The Ships.&nbsp; (4/5)</h4>
<p>The set comes with a speeder and a turret which both have great-looking color schemes.&nbsp; The speeder with a 2x2x2 clear brick piece&nbsp;is very sleek and good-looking all around.&nbsp; The minifigure can sit on a 2x2 brick space&nbsp;where his hands can attach to the steering controls.&nbsp; The wings on the sides can move up and down.&nbsp; There is ""swooshability"" for this speeder.&nbsp; I love way the LEGO Company made the front and tail of the speeder.&nbsp; It looks brilliant along with turrent's front.&nbsp; You can put a minifigure on a 2x2 brick space.&nbsp; The gun can move a 360 degree rotation.&nbsp; Overall, the ships are great, but the problem with this set is the fact that the playability is limited, until you buy the 7913 Clone Trooper Battle Pack for Clone Troopers to battle.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>The Value.&nbsp; (4/5)</h4>
<p>The price-per-ratio is bad because it is 17 cents per piece.&nbsp; It should have been $6.99 with the price-per-ratio being 10 cents.&nbsp; However, I do like the stuff you get in the set.&nbsp; Overall, it is worth picking up.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>The Summary.</h4>
<p>In conclusion, this set has 4 excellent minifigures, 5 essential guns, 1 awesome speeder, and 1 cool turret which is 68 pieces&nbsp;which retails for $11.99.&nbsp; It is a great buy.&nbsp; You will not be dissatisified.&nbsp; But if you are build a Mandalorian army, you need to get it on a BOGO50% discount.&nbsp; Comparing to the 7913 Clone Trooper Battle Pack, I get this first because we have never gotten any Mandalorian except Jango Fett and Boba Fett before.&nbsp; But if you want an army of something, get the 7913 for more pieces and cooler minifigures.&nbsp; Overall, you will appereciate it.&nbsp; If you want more playability, buy both this and 7913 for $23.98 which is pretty good for playability and 8 minifigures.&nbsp; Overall Rating:&nbsp; 23/25 (92%)</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4

The helmet and jet pack are separated, in the fashion of the recent Lego Boba Fett from the 2010 rerelease of the Slave I (set 8097). In the earlier sets, the helmet and jetpack for Boba and Jango were one piece. The new design looks more realistic and allows for flexibility in the neck for these figures.<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-mandalorian.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/Star%20Wars/mandywithouthelmet.jpg[/img]</span><br></a><br>One of the slight disappointments of this set is the lack of a difference between the four Mandalorian figures. They are all exactly the same, as opposed to the many variations of the Clone troopers like the ones from the recent Clone Battle Pack. Hopefully we will get more Mandalorian sets in the future (the Mandalorian league “Death Watch” has become more significant in the recent “Clone Wars” TV episodes) and will have more variations on the Mandalorian figure design. Another strange thing is that the faces are all exactly the same, just like the Clone Troopers.

<p>The set comes with four figures all of which are blue mandalorians. The figures themselves like most battle packs are the key feature and have beutifal printing on the helmet and chest. All mandalorians are packed with different sized guns some being very small and on having a big gun. </p>
<p>The set contains a range of small accesseries and vehicles for the mandolians to battle with. The main object is a small winged flying vehicle which can hold one mandalorian figure on top which looks like a nicely sized vehicle. Another accesserie is a turret stand where one mandalorian can take aim and fire out at clone trooper which in my view is a great addition to the battle pack due to the variaiton of vehicles it offers [ which often appears in most battle packs]. There is also a smaller&nbsp; gun turret included however this one in my view has not been as well done due to it's punyness. Apart from that, it has a very nice range of accesseries which are all excellent additions to the battle pack. </p>
<p>The set parts are of a very good standard with the helmet and armour printing on the figures being superb. the set also has common [but useful] other parts such as wings, a car tyre hub blue curved wedge and long black tube brick. </p>
<p>The playability on it's own is fairly durable but when conbined with the Clone battle pack makes the play value far more durable when theyre together. </p>
<p>For £9.99 [ now £11.99] the sets value for money is of a reasonable value however the piece count and size of the battle pack is quite small in comparison to others of its price and size. For it's currently higher price of £11.99 though, the price is too high and has just over half the parts a size for this price should have. The set shouldve stayed at £9.99 as it's a much better price. </p>
<p>Overall, I recommend this set to all star wars fans, army builders and any general lego fan for the figures and supporting accesseries. </p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,3

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is mostly standard but has a few good parts and colors. The blue wheel well, the mounted gun&#39;s blaster piece, the black torch handle, the grey 3x1&nbsp;smooth slope. Those are cool, but nothing too special.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All four Mandalorians are identical and have really goofy faces. You can&#39;t use them for much other than Mandalorians but they are very imposing!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building the three parts is very simple an standard, as you may expect. No surprises here, although the SNOT turret is nice.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like this battle pack more than others in a way because&nbsp;instead of one big vehicle it has a smaller vehicle and two other items, the two guns. That makes this battle pack a bit more of a battle pack instead of just a small vehicle. Makes for a more interesting battle with their clone enemies!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Battle packs are always pricey for the amount of parts but as usual you get a lot of minifigures. While I usually like having armies of identical figures, the Mandalorians aren&#39;t doing it for me. I haven&#39;t used them in a MOC, and I don&#39;t really see the point of making an army of these guys. Good for young fans of Star Wars who want to make a battle, but I don&#39;t think I would buy it myself (I received it as a gift I believe).</p>

"Odeinoichus","2012-10-27T18:28:09.85Z","Mandos on the March","<p><strong>Set #7914 Mandalorian Battle Pack:</strong> After years of Star Wars themed sets, with only a bare few of them featuring our favorite Mandalorian Bounty Hunter Boba and to my knowledge only one set featuring Jango his father, LEGO brings us something Star Wars fans had been itching for, for years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mandalorian Battle Pack, much like the Clone&nbsp;Troopers Battle Pack features four Mini-Figures and a small build, while the Clones only had one model in the BARC Speeder, the Mandos got two smaller models. Fast and easy to build, both models enhance the play value of this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first model is a small gun station, designed for defensive perimeters the gun station is manned by one of the Mandos. We've seen gun stations before, with other Clone sets, this and the other model however are all uniform in color. With blues and greys matching the tones of the Mini-Figures themselves, these models are all uniform in nature and look great, especially in multiples. (Or with the new Mandalorian Starfighter.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second model is a fairly small&nbsp;speeder vehicle used by the Mando Commander, or Captain, considering the Mando given the speeder carries the small pistol accessories Clone Captains and Commanders use. This model is a fun little number for kids, for adults it's more of an afterthought that adds to displays and dioramas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You build a third item, not much of a build really, taking some pieces and a Mini-Figure accessory you create a special weapon for one of the Mando Mini-Figures, a sort of dual-legged assault blaster/sniper weapon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are perfect looking, with uniform colors of dark blue and gray they evoke the Mandalorian design from the Clone Wars Cartoon. Unfortunately none of these Mandos have double-sided torsos. A minor complaint, as the detail work is very impressive on the prints, and considering they are also wearing the brand new jetpack piece for the Mandalorian armor back printing would have been wasted on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new helmet piece is quite nice too, and the faces, while all identical, have the Clone Wars aesthetic. The assortment of weapons included are mostly found in other sets with Clones, but they work just as good here as they do in those other sets. Overall this is a must have set, a much appreciated troop builder style set for those of you who want to army build Mandos. And they complement Pre Vizslaw's set quite nicely. The only thing missing from this set honestly are the viewfinders found on Mando helmets, the helmets themselves have two tiny holes in the side for such a piece, but for whatever reason LEGO did not include them. Still I highly reccomend this set to every LEGO Star Wars fan.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

All necessary pieces of equipment for a proper army. ;)<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: I like the minifigures. While I'm not the biggest Mandalorian fan, these figures are a good addition to a collection. They are pretty detailed and even have angry battle-faces. I like the blue and grey color scheme; it separates them from Boba Fett and the all the Imperial figures I have.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The speeder and the turret are pretty cool. LEGO can't do anything too elaborate because the main reason for the set is the minifigures, but they did a decent job with these two models; both have good playability.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Con 1: All the minifigures are the same. In the other battle packs you get a variety, but here you have 4 blue/grey Mandalorians.

"alfred_the_buttler","2021-01-23T06:03:50.6Z","Only worth it for the minifigures ","<p>So I already owned a couple of the Mandalorian minifigures that I picked up over the years, but was thinking that since I&#39;m buying all the Mando sets from the show, maybe I ought to have this set as well, and it is very cheap to piece it together on Bricklink if you aren&#39;t buying the minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>You get four identical Death Watch minifigures in this set. Certainly they lack the detail and variety of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75267-1/Mandalorian-Battle-Pack"">new Mandalorian battle pack</a>, yet, they are perfect for anyone who is trying to put together a battle from the Clone Wars. They also make a decent stand-in for Bo-Katan and her friends that appeared with her on the new show. Obviously, they are all male and lack details, but at least they are the right colors. Until Lego releases a new set with these characters, these will be your best bet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Builds</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most disappointing thing about this set. You get two tiny, super simple builds (3 if you count the heavy artillery). First is a speeder. This is the same design as the speeder in the newer Mandalorian battle pack, only much simpler and it hovers on a clear cylinder. Quite honestly, my kids could design much better speeders, and they&#39;d be a lot sturdier too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also get a bunker with a cannon that is equally simple. The best part about it is the rather unique piece that the cannon is built off of. Again, this type of build was copied in the newer battle pack and with much more detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, if you can consider it a build, you get a portable cannon that is compromised of 6 pieces, centered around one of those old cameras that appeared in Classic Space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Verdict&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing how the newer set is still available in stores, there is zero reason to get this set anymore, unless you like the color scheme better. If that is the case, may I suggest purchasing the bricks for the new set in the colors of this set so that you have better and more substantial models. This set is really only worth it for the minifigures, and assuming we start getting Bo-Katan and other Mandalorians in the not too distant future, even the minifigures may not be worth it for much longer.&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;The minifigures in this set are all the same four identical Mandolorian warriors. They all wear the same Mandolorian helmet in dark grey with a black visor and blue and white accents. There torsos are printed with Mandalorian armor over dark blue shirt and a brown and gray belt. There faces are Clone Wars style printing with exaggerated features. There legs are blue with grey hips. They all wear grey jet packs. One carries a blaster rifle. The other carries a regular blaster. Another one carries two blaster pistols.

<p>&nbsp; The first thing you build is a long range blaster for the unarmed Mando. Second thing you build is a one man turret for another warrior.
