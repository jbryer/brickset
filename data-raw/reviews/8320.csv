set (7915) is a LEGO Star Wars set which came out in 2011. It comes
with 2 minifigures. This set also does include decals.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifigure:</span><br><br>
<ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Imperial Pilot:</span> First of I thought the imperial pilot would look the same as I've seen in some reviews of the TIE Defender set. The pilot has the new helmet design from the 2010 TIE Defender with some new markings. The torso is new and he has some markings on his back of his torso. He also comes with a <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">face</span> which you'll see in my videos which I'm positng with this review.<br></li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">R2-Q2:</span> When I saw R2-Q2 for the first time I thought this R2 unit would be chrome but I was wrong. The whole R2 unit comes in a dark grey color and with some cool markings. I wish LEGO could have give us a chrome R2-Q2 which would have made this set into a collector's item.<br></li></ul><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><strong>Imperial V-wing Starfighter:</strong><br><br>
<ul><li>Before I begin I have to say that I haven't noticed this version of the V-wing in any Star Wars movies. The V-wing has a very cool design. One problem is that the pilot doesn't have any controls in the cockpit. A cool thing about this set is how you can move the wings of the starfighter. You have to move a big gear which makes both wings moving. But once you turned the wings up just like you can see on the box the model can't stay very well and the wings fold down. Another problem is that you have to take off the head of the R2 unit if you want to get him behind the cockpit. A big plus is that this set includes 2 new elements which I haven't seen before.<br></li></ul>

It has a slick black/gray/white color variation which is satisfactory. The figures are also fantastic. The R2-Q2 droid has a very detailed body with the newer, more cartoonish looking decal.

"David1971","2011-02-04T17:22:34.46Z","Sleek, stylish, and quite substantial","<p>Well, this is more like it! It's good to have a pleasing, stylish spaceship, which has very little wrong with it and is quite straightforward and, in LEGO Star Wars terms, reasonably inexpensive.</p><p>The minifig and the R2 droid are both very nicely done. I like those black Imperial pilots, and this one is a bit different to the ones we've had before. (Other reviews, such as the excellent ones by 'maaboo35' and 'Duckuss_Maxximus', give you more precise detail than this review will - including where bits of this pilot have been seen before - but I do like to review every set I build to say what I *feel* about it).</p><p>The ship is more substantial and chunky towards the back than you might think from the photos - which is good - and the whole thing is a good size and eminently swooshable. For £18 (current price on Amazon.co.uk) this is reasonably priced ... and it's the kind of set you could give to someone who had not had a LEGO Star Wars set before, and feel proud!</p><p>The only two negative points are:</p><p>(1) there are a few stickers - not too bad, but still annoying ... as we always say, *why* can't they print them?! The rationale is to keep costs down, but I wouldn't care if the set cost 50p more and they'd bothered to do printing instead of stickers.</p><p>(2) I don't actually mind too much with this one, but I always complain when there is nowhere for minifigs to sit down in a vehicle. Here, the pilot has a seat (although no controls or computer or anything); and the R2 droid has to stay home and watch. (They suggest you can take his head off and take that for a flight, but I don't think that's a very clever solution). Including a little space for the R2 unit on the ship would be the kind of design challenge you would think the clever LEGO designers could cope with.</p><p>Neither of these negatives is very bad - the ship looks fine without stickers, in fact; and maybe R2 units *are* destined to stay home and do repairs.</p><p>Overall, a very good set. And also - note to LEGO - they should do more sets at this price point where you get a whole decent-looking vehicle and a couple of figs. It's a good plan and would attract new purchasers, I think.<br></p><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
"EtudeTheBadger","2011-01-21T16:44:09.147Z","Black is the New Red!","Okay, then! New year, new V-wing! And it looks fantastic!<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span><br><h4>Pros<br></h4><p>The ""Imperial V-wing fighter"" is a solid model, make no mistake! It has a great colour scheme, black with that sterile Empire grey, and some really nice details. Building the model is quite a remove from the 2006 version, with a more rounded selection of parts. Literally! The underside of the ship uses some very curved parts, making it look more streamlined, and a single fuselage piece on top of the nose is in place of the wedge and plates from the older V-wing. Brown, an unusual choice in my book, is used for the inner part of the main nose and seat; it looks strange at first, but it does work. Possibly the best new feature is the guns - they're more compact than the V-wing of old, and compliment the wings nicely! <br></p><p>Coming in a close second for best new feature(s) are the wings themselves! The system seen here for landing and takeoff is more movie realistic - they rotate rather than closing, and make for quite a spectacle. <br></p><p>The minifigures are nothing short of amazing, either! A pre-TIE Fighter Imperial Pilot and R2-Q2 - <span style=""font-style: italic;"">love him</span>! - are our stars, and they <span style=""font-style: italic;"">really</span> look cool. The Pilot uses a black version of the 2010 ARC-170 helmet, with a TIE-style uniform and black head, while R2-Q2 has a darkish metallic shine.<br></p><p>Let's round off the Pros with a quick glance at everything else: a clear, cylindrical 2x2 round mounting part for display when the wings are rotated up; NO silly flick-fire missiles; a superb canopy part with hinges that blows older parts out of the water; and finally, some nice engines!</p><h4>Cons</h4>Oh, right. While the V-wing is a good model, there have to be some downsides.<br><p>First off, the stickers. You got to acknowledge them at some point, right? Yep. While the stickers in this set are few in number, they are a pain to attach, and can look really bad if not applied correctly. Even the round Imperial logos are stickers, a concept I'd hoped to see phased out.</p><p>The second of our cons is subjective. While I hope this isn't the norm, the R2-Q2 figure I got is badly printed, and his legs are quite loose. It brought the set down a bit. Also, you have to remove his dome and fit it onto the ship. I find this a little lazy, and a droid socket could easily have been put in. Maybe some modification will fix that problem...<br></p><p>Lastly, and obviously, the price. Of course. £21.99 for a set that should cost half that.&nbsp;</p><h4>Pros and Cons at a Glance</h4><ul><li>Pros:</li><li>Good-looking ship!</li><li>Good use of parts and colours</li><li>Minifigures are brilliant</li><li>Great new features</li></ul><ul><li>Cons</li><li>Stickers</li><li>R2-Q2 has some flaws (won't happen to everyone, I hope)</li><li>Only R2-Q2's dome fits on the V-wing<br></li><li>Price is way too high</li></ul>Overall, even though the price asks a lot, you'll get a lot out of this set, and it's a good purchase for fans and enthusiasts!

"Duckuss_Maxximus","2011-01-25T01:51:43.607Z","7915-1 Imperial V-Wing Starfighter - Back In Black","<p>When I first saw this set on the Lego website I was instantly intrigued by it. I remembered the previous red V-Wing (6205) because a friend of mine had it and it was pretty awesome then. This new black one is 10x better! The figures caught my attention mainly at first. The former V-Wing only had a red R2 unit head but no body. This time around they gave R2-Q2 a body and a new silvery-grey color scheme. The pilot puzzled me at first mainly because there weren't decent pictures of him when it first came out. I later realized he has the printed face/open helmet set-up as the pilot in Palpatine's Shuttle (8096). Which is cool but I prefer the standard pilot face with the orange visor and chin strap. That's just me though. When I ordered it and it finally arrived I got busy building right away! The new wing mechanism is a great feature as opposed to moving the wings from attack mode to flight mode manually. There were some things I disliked about the set but they were few and far between compared to what I liked about the set. Mainly I don't like the decals. I'd prefer printed pieces. Also I don't like how you have to take off the R2-units head to mount him to the ship. They should've made a compartment/socket to stash his whole body. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Unique minifigs (R2-Q2 has a body and a new paint scheme.&nbsp;Pilot has printed face/open helmet set up)</li>
    <li>Black color scheme</li>
    <li>New wing mechanism for flight/attack modes</li>
    <li>Windshield better fitted than the previous</li>
    <li>Shorter top fins and built w/ less pieces (don't fall apart as easily)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Cones for turrets this time around</li>
    <li>Display stand is too small (clear round brick)</li>
    <li>No compartment to stash R2-unit</li>
    <li>No cockpit controls</li>

"legoclone","2011-03-07T19:56:17.473Z","Nice Improvment for the V-wing","Nicely done Lego!&nbsp; It always bugged me with the old Republic V-wing that the wings didn’t do what the wings of the actual V-wing in the movies and cartoon did -- namely rotate into the landing position.&nbsp; I’ve actually tried to come up with a fix for that older kit but it looks like the Lego engineers beat me too it with this one.&nbsp; It’s a really simple mechanism that achieves the desired results.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also like the smother profile with the elongated canopy and the large curved nose piece with the one easy sticker.&nbsp; There is a bit of a cockpit gap but not too bad when compared to other kits.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new pilot helmet is pretty sweet as well; it’s basically a black version of the flight helmets that came with the new ARC-170 last year.&nbsp; As this craft represents the early steps between star fighter development from the Republic to the Empire that makes sense.&nbsp; All in all I really like this kit.&nbsp; If I had one minor complaint it would be the lack of some retractable forward landing gear to allow the V-wing to sit level when on the ground but this is easily addressed with some parts from the spare-part box",FALSE,4,5,5,4,5

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>An enjoyable build</li>
    <li>Reasonably good looking</li>
    <li>Cool minifigures</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>

    <li>No cockpit detail</li>
</ul>
<p>I find this model interesting, with some nice/less common minifigures. The rotating wing assembly is simple and robust. I enjoyed the build. There was some repetition in the wing section, but not so much to make it monotonous. I found building both wings concurrently helped with that as well. There are a few interesting pieces, like large wing plates.</p>
<p>I'd like to see more sets around this price point, even though I still think 18 cents per piece is a bit high. I realize this is a licensed set and that adds to the cost, but 15 cents would have been great.</p>
<p>My astromech body had odd color patterns in the plastic. Not cool.</p>
<p>Would have been nice to have a spare head, one for the figure, one on the ship.</p>
<p>Wings have no &quot;positive&quot; position. Have to eyeball it.</p>
<p>I absolutely hate stickers! Especially ones like the imperial logos, which there should be more than enough requirement for to have them printed. Hard enough aligning them on center, but also need to be the correct rotational orientation. It does not have to be off by much to look bad. I am an AFOL, I'd hate to see how bad I'd do as a youngling! This part, as small as it is, really takes away from the overall enjoyment of the build. It can also make the set look pretty bad if you don't do a spot-on job of applying the stickers. This dragged my &quot;building experience&quot; score from about a 4.5 down to 3.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Orthobotrex","2011-07-08T13:22:58.62Z","Stealthy looking beast","<h4>This is not the best of all the other STAR WARS ships out there, but this star fighter looks lean and sharp...</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the way the sillhoutte of the ship makes it stand out. Add the color combinations and you have for yourself something akin to&nbsp;a vehicle in stealth mode. This should then be displayed against a light-colored background to make it stand out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience of building the ship is about average, as everything is pretty much snap-on-as-you-go. The flipping mechanism for the wings allows easy and firm&nbsp;positioning, although the terminal ends of each swing are slightly loose. The windscreen is positioned well into the cockpit (unlike my experience with the freeco speeder where it was not flush) though the farthest end will not snap shut onto the corresponding studs. This is not a cause for worry as the clips firmly close it. Thus, I'll give this a high swoosh factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being&nbsp;more of a minifig collector, these are what I like the most with this set. The new design (and, of course,&nbsp;the color)&nbsp;of the pilot is just amazing! I like the detail involved in its every curve and the way&nbsp;the helmet lets the eyes peer out. The prints on the torso are greatly detailed&nbsp;as well. You also&nbsp;get another member of the R2 droid family with a new pearly grey color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, of course, there are things I would like to have changed in this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PACKAGING:</p>
<p>To start with, the sticker sheet was curved inside the box so that&nbsp;after you apply them, the edges curl up.&nbsp;You also need delicate care in putting them on as not doing so will cause the long sheet on the front end to be off-center, or the imperial emblem to be slightly rotated out of position (I guess this is why they used the term&nbsp;""dreaded"" in DSS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The black part that makes up the front of the fuselage is not packaged inside a bag, and&nbsp;I believe this is what damaged the instruction manual of my set (there was a small but significant tear on the front page) so don't shake those MISB's too much!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE SHIP:</p>
<p>I would have&nbsp;preferred that the gears&nbsp;rotating the wings be placed inside the construct, although I guess doing so will make the ship&nbsp;a bit wider. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get an extra 1x1&nbsp;dark bley round plate and a bush, but since the right wing almost touches the gears, I recommend putting the extra bush&nbsp;into the axle&nbsp;and this will give it enough clearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MINIFIGS:</p>
<p>Lastly, My droid has marbled markings at its back, which I presume is from the molding process. I just hope you guys don't get the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is still a nice set with one of the best SW minifigs!</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

I was however pleasantly surprised by this set, it is by no means fantastic, but it is certainly worth purchasing. I do like the&nbsp;Minifigures and like many other sets in recent waves the figures are what make the set, not the model itself.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is very eye-catching and stands out well, it features the planet Mustafar in the background with the V-Wing flying along firing all 4 green lasers. There is an explosion just below the fighter so it has evidently run into difficulty. The box also makes very sure we are aware that both Minifigures are brand new with a shot of the figures standing side by side with a stamp proclaiming that they are indeed new.</p><p>The instructions also are perfect, no mistakes that I have found! All the parts were there for me and that is what we shall move onto next.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a few new parts in this set which I would like to draw your attention to, firstly the brilliant new cockpit&nbsp;which&nbsp;was new, however since the&nbsp;release&nbsp;of this set the same piece has been included in certainly Alien Conquest set 7066 - Earth Defence HQ, and also on the new Space Designer set which has recently been released as the first set of the Master Builder Academy. However despite appearing in a couple of other sets it is still quite a rare piece and very useful due to how sleek and streamlined it appears. There are also quite a few hinges included in the set which often come in handy for MOCing as well 3 pieces with the Empire logo, unfortunately these are stickers but they still look great and are great to have if you are wanting to make any of your own Imperial themed vehicles.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are 2 Minifigures which are both very nice, not exactly stand out Minifigures in my opinion, but still&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;worth adding to your collection. The Pilot in particular is very useful and is highly detailed, looking very sinister in an entirely black uniform. The figure consists of a pair of plain black legs, a very nicely detailed torso which features a life support pack and piping, as well as some back printing, as far as I can see the torso is identical to the one from the Republic Clone Pilot from set 8088 - ARC-170 Starfighter apart from the fact that this one is black with grey printing. The head and helmet though are the real show-stoppers, the head looks incredible with shiny silver printing on a black head, the wide eyes create a very blank looking face which in this case makes him look a little bit frightening. The helmet is even better, it is incredibly detailed featuring 2 Empire symbols in silver as well as some other highlighting, mainly consisting of vents, all over the helmet. However it is not a new mould as it is identical to the one from the earlier Phase 2 Clone Pilots.</p><p>The other&nbsp;Minifigure&nbsp;is a brand new R2 Unit, who is apparently called R2-Q2. He appears briefly in A New Hope where he is scouring the computers&nbsp;on-board&nbsp;the Tantive IV for information about the Death Star plans. The Minifigure is not a shiny silver unlike how he appeared in early images of the set, however this is accurate to the film and he stills looks fine in a pearly silver and is very well detailed.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very easy and takes about twenty minutes or so at a leisurely pace. There are not many interesting building techniques but I do like how the wings and fins look, a great&nbsp;improvement&nbsp;on the older V-Wing from 2006.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When constructed the set looks great for displaying, but is also very 'swooshable' and easy to play with. The engines look really nice and have some sort of green light coming from them. I do sadly have 2 slight problems with the set though, firstly the lack of any decent landing gear, sure, the clear cylinder does it's job but it looks terrible, and I don't think it would have been too hard to include some retractable landing legs. Also I think the guns look a bit silly as well, they are totally inaccurate to the film and are just lazy in my opinion. However I do like the sleek look of the fighter and the swivelling wings feature is not bad, a bit boring perhaps, but it is better than nothing I suppose. The fighter looks just as good with or without the Astromech head placed behind the cockpit, and while it is a shame the main body of the droid does not fit in&nbsp;the&nbsp;fighter, but I think that would have been difficult to incorporate into the design without ruining the sleek look of the model and is an understandable decision by the designers.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I would say this is perhaps the weakest of this latest wave of sets but is still worth purchasing as a display item and a toy which is easy to play with for younger children as it is very sturdy and will not fall apart on you. The Minifigures are also pretty good, and are of course both exclusive, so for Minifigure collectors this set is a must buy. I would say this an improvement over the older V-Wing, however I would have preferred a Republic V-Wing rather than this. The price is fairly high, a huge jump from the older set, but still is not extortionate for what you get!</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 7/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

Overall, these minifigures are extremely awesome with great detail.&nbsp; My favorite is the pilot.&nbsp; The minifigure value is great because each one of them sell for $5-$15 each.&nbsp; <br><h4>The Starfighter.&nbsp; (4/5)</h4>The Imperial V-wing Starfighter has a great look it with an excellent color scheme of black and gray.&nbsp; The ship is held up by a 2x2 transparent brick which makes it unstable sitting; but it's okay.&nbsp; It has a sticker in the front of the ship with good detailing.&nbsp; The cockpit, which is new, can move up, and you can sit the pilot one a 2x3 brick space with his blaster in his hands.&nbsp; The astromech can sit on a 2x2 brick space behind the cockpit (with the Imperial logo is which is on the center section of each wing too) if you take its dome off and put it on there.&nbsp; There is also movable parts near the astromech's head.&nbsp; The back has two neon green engines which is great.&nbsp; The wings can move if you turn the a wing from the sitting position to its flight mode by turn it to toward the ship and wing will move at the same time.&nbsp; On each wing, which are the same, but different location, have two smaller wings on side to move left or right.&nbsp; For the normal attack position, move them a little bit to the left (if you are facing the set) on the right big wing; do the same for the other except the opposite directions.&nbsp; The big wide section has two cone-cylinder pieces for the guns.&nbsp; I would like the fire-flick missiles instead as another play feature.&nbsp; It has great ""swooshability"" feature.&nbsp; I will note that the ship is sturdy, for one of children drop it and only a few pieces broke.&nbsp; I wish this set had more playability another than the wings and the swooshability.&nbsp; <br><h4>The Value.&nbsp; (5/5)</h4>The price-per-ratio (14 cents per piece) is not good; however, this set is completely worth $20 because of the ship's great look, minifigures, and the probable army builder for the vessels.&nbsp; <br><h4>The Summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>In summary, this set is a definite buy.&nbsp; It has a great price point, outstanding minifigures, and elegantly-looking starfighter.&nbsp; The set has a great army builder set for the Imperial at a cheaper price.&nbsp; However, I do wish that the fighter had more playability like flick-fire missiles.&nbsp; But overall, it is <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">very </span>good set.&nbsp; Overall rating:&nbsp; 24/25 (96% out of 100)<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Huge_Nerd","2012-01-03T21:29:16.163Z","Value and Vindication for the V-Wing!","I got this set as a Christmas present and couldn't be happier. As has been mentioned, the V-Wing in Imperial colors is seen at the end of Episode III. It's nice to have a model of a more obscure vehicle. The box art really sells the model too. It looks sharp with the magma planet of Mustafar behind it.<br><br>This set includes two minifigures. The pilot design is the perfect choice for this ship. The Imperial V-Wing is a kind of transition vehicle between the Republic crafts and the TIE fleet of the Empire. This pilot in this set looks like the halfway point of evolution between the Phase II Clone pilot and the later TIE pilot--perfect for the transition period. <br><br>R2-Q2 is also a nice addition. He is actually found in Episode IV scanning files on the Tantive when Vader and his troops board. His color scheme works perfectly with the black and grey of the fighter. I substituted R2-Q5's black head on the V-Wing to see what it looked like and the silver head was definitely the better choice. I will note that R2-Q2 is made of a somewhat metalic gray plastic where you can see some swirls in the plastic. As a collector of Transformers, I can't help but get bad thoughts of GPS (Gold Plastic Syndrome which, despite its name, can affect swirly plastics of other colors too http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Gold_Plastic_Syndrome).<br><br>The starfighter itself has a nice intuitive build. The final result is a sleek, swooshable fighter. While the model is primarily black and gray, there are two other (visible) colors that are used well. Most stirkingly are the neon green/yellow ion thrusters. They really pop against the black background. Second, the interior of the cockpit is a nice dark brown which distinguishes the exterior from the interior--leather interior?--nicely. <br><br>The price for this is also great. For $20 you get a good sized sharp looking fighter and two nice minifigs. I think this fighter is a great alternative for those who may not have the budget for the larger, more expensive TIE Fighter coming out 2012.<br><br>As a bonus, Lego has alternate instructions for this set on the Build Together site:<br><br>http://www.buildtogether.com/assets%5Cpdf%5CSW_ImperialBladewing.pdf<br><br>The Imperial Bladewing appears to be a non-canonical vehicle. The build is simple and quick, but the final result is a very solid, swooshable, and cool looking little scout fighter.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

Silly as it may seem, I was rather taken by the R2-Q2 minifigure and seriously considered getting this set for myself. Or at least just the minifigure alone. What sweetened the deal is a sale from Wal-Mart dropping it's price down to $15 for me to finally go ahead and pick this up. $19.99 would still be worth it, but a sale is very sweet.<br><br>Part of what made me hesitant for a while getting this up, is 1) focusing on other themes and their sets for my collection first. 2) While I love Star Wars, I'm very partial to the original classic trilogy of movies, not the newer movies, series, sets, toys, ect.<br><br>The build of this set is very straight forward and enjoyable for me. The black and gray coloring along with its sleek design make for a very solid ship. There's a technic build for the wings for the landing and flight mode. A simple rotation of the gear and the ship is ready to go.<br><br>I love Star Wars, I'm just very picky about what I'll pick up as I don't necessarily like very ship design that comes out.

"Snowtrooper119","2011-11-23T02:38:45.997Z"," A good set with good minifigs","<p>I missed out on the 2006 version and was quite dissapointed but now&nbsp;I have&nbsp;this cooler new version. This is quite different to the standard&nbsp;spaceships of the empire, instead of tie fighters we have a v-wing. This is quite unusual as we have only had tie fighters and other tie-class spaceships so to have an imperial fighter that isn't a tie-class is very unusual but this is&nbsp; a good thing. Besides a new tie fighter is coming out next year (2012). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box</h4>
<p>The box is way to big for the actual amount of pieces you get, it is full of air and is a bit dissapointing. Other than that the box art is pretty cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>There are only two minifigures but the two minifigures are both very cool and very unique. The imperial pilot doesn't have the normal tie pilot mold but instead&nbsp;uses the mold for the arc-170 pilot and is very cool in black with imperial insignia. The pilot head also looks very cool but needs the helmet to look really good. The printing on the torso is cool but is very similar to other tie pilot torso's. R2-Q2 is a silver astromech droid. Nuff said. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>V-wing</h4>
<p>The v-wing is a black, gray and&nbsp;slightly more detailed version of the 2006 model. It also has a few extra pieces. This is jet blackwith grey detailing and *sigh* stickers. The stickers in this set seem to be terrible and do not stick very well. Other than that it has some cool details such as the green engines at the back and imperial emblems on the wings. Overall it looks&nbsp;really cool but I do not like the stickers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>It is a good&nbsp; set and looks cool on a shelf but do not expect great things from the stickers. The minifigures are great and are a good reason to buy this set. It is a bit pricey for what you get but that does not matter. Buy it if you have some spare money lying around. I recommend it to fans of star wars and lego spaceships and fans of the colour black.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>

<p>The pictures and quality on the box are great, but mine was beaten up when I bought it. The instructions were easy to follow and without errors.</p>

<h4>Parts</h4>

<p>Good parts, great for MOCs. I especially liked the black piece that helps make up the front of the ship. The helmet piece is also fairly new. But there were so many STICKERS...</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>

<p>Both figs are brand new. The pilot has amazing printing, but the legs could have been better. R2-Q2 is great for Imperial MOCS, but I thought he was a Rebel droid as seen on <em>Tantive IV </em>at the beginning of A New Hope. Overall, superb quality.</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<p>The building takes around 30 minutes and was mostly symmetrical, except for the mechanism used to turn the wings into &#39;V&#39; formation.</p>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<p>It&#39;s very fun to play with, but a little boring on its own because of the fact that there is no conflict. You can always make something up, though,</p>

"patat73","2012-12-31T10:36:14.78Z","Review of  7915-Imperial V-wing Starfighter","<p>I bought this set at a Target with some leftover Christmas money, and&nbsp;I must say, it looks pretty good. It has a nice sleek apperence and has an interesting color scheme. This set comes with two minifigures- a pilot and a R2-Q2 driod.</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures</strong>-I'll start with the pilot. He is very detailed, despite being in all black.&nbsp;he has some back printing with the back of his outfit, and on his front&nbsp;is the only color on him: some red and blue bottons thet control his helmet i'm guessing. His head has part of the&nbsp;helmet's printing, while the helment is the same kind used by the new clone pilots. he looks good even without the helmet on. He&nbsp;also has a short blaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R2-Q2 is basically a chrome silver R2-D2. Of course, this just makes the driod even cooler. I have nothing elso to say about him.</p>
<p><strong>The Ship-</strong>This thing is cool. It does have some stickers, but i don't really care about them. Plus, there are only six, and they wern't that hard to apply. I like the cockpit, which isa drown color, so it adds to the ship, which is mainly Light grey and black. The pilot can fit inside the cockpit very easily, even when hes holding his gun. But now we reach my first complaint- you have to take R2-Q2's head off and only put that on the ship. My only other complaint is with the small blasters on the wings. They break off very easily. But other then that, the wings turn very easily. That's also the only action in this set, ther arn't even any flick missles.</p>
<p><strong>Overall-</strong>This set works well if you have another ship to fly around with it. If your a star wars fan, this shouldn't be an issue. It also needs more action, but is still fun to swoop around. If your a collecter, this set looks good on display.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"ninbricks","2017-09-13T13:56:02.27Z","a deadly black imperial beauty with the potential to really shine","<p>This Imperial V-Wing Starfighter in my opinion is the most beautiful and intimidating version of that vessel, LEGO brought to life. The dark color scheme really suits my vision of imperial aesthetics, and the pilot as well as the silver astromech-droid are superb figures that make the set a highlight.</p>

<p>But, there are three major flaws that really provoked my tuning-abilities from the first day I saw this set. Number one being the fact that you have to leave the droids body behind, when the ship is in flight-mode. Are you kiddin me, LEGO!?! Hell no, you only want us fans to make it right... :-) And it&#39;s really no big deal to make it capable of fitting the whole droid inside!!</p>

<p>Number two is a too often seen flaw of LEGO-models; the missing cockpit-detailing. But depending on your skills, you can easily design a good seating with a clip for a gun and a console. I decided to take a small blaster instead of the one that comes with the set, because it fits better into the small cockpit.</p>

<p>Number three is the fact, that the starfighter has to land on the gun-barrels, which is a shame on it&#39;s own, and that the wing-folding-mode is not accurate to the original. But this once again is a true &quot;masterbuilder-freak-mission&quot;! Just search through the &quot;www-net of possibilities&quot; and you&#39;ll find good source material. And with a few modifications you have a wonderfully accurate version of the Alpha-3 Nimbus-Class V-Wing Starfighter.</p>

<p>So yeah, it&#39;s a really great set!!. One may think that I emphasize too much on the flaws, but they are the &quot;bonus-play-factor&quot; in my opinion. Not only building it according to the manual and then letting it catch dust, but tuning it up, making it perfect, squeezing out every little chance to make it a high-class-model. THAT is LEGO to me!!!</p>

"AlkkuV","2022-01-29T15:33:38.127Z","Imagine if the Empire would have used this.","<p>Hello guys, it&#39;s me, AlkkuV back with another review. Today I&#39;ll be reviewing set number: 7915 Imperial V-Wing Starfighter. This is a ship that Empire sadly, never used. So this doesn&#39;t appear in any of the movies. But without further ado let&#39;s get into the review.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: The box art was nice, the planet looks like Mustafar, Bespin or Tatooine, but I&#39;m not sure what planet is it.&nbsp;The instructions were clear and had 55 pages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: This set comes with two minifigures. They are: Imperial V-Wing Pilot and Astromech Droid, R2-Q2, Red Dots Small. They both are unique to this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: There are 139 pieces in this set. Lots of useful Black and Medium Stone Grey pieces for MOCs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: The build was nice and easy. We also get six stickers: Two of them are actually useful, the ones with the Empire logo. One thing bothers me in the ship, though. There is no place for R2-Q2. You can only put its head on the ship. There is a space between the wings that the droid would easily fit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete Build: Overall the set is very good. Just not that much playability, a couple of unnecessary stickers on the top of the wings and no place for the whole Astromech, only its head. Minifigs are very good and so was the build also the parts were a welcome surprise. Overall I would give this set a 4.8/5.</p>
