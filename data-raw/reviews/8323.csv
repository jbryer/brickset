","This was only my second Technic set, having built regular sets for 9 years I thought it was time to finally try a Technic set!<div><br></div><div>What I like most about Technic sets is the complexity and the challenges within the sets. Themes such as CITY are becoming too easy, and contain no 'advanced building techniques'. Building a set such the Container Truck proved to be a far different experience.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One of the most interesting parts within the set is the 'Container' portion. This piece is not actually locked into the set, rather it's secured with the Technic pieces that act as the hydraulic lifts. Unless you physically play with the container (other than using the gear) it will stay in place, and provide you with enough of a 'dump' to empty all the pieces out. I found it interesting that it wasn't locked in with a Technic piece.</div><div><br></div><div>The most challenging part of this set was the cab. There were probably 25-30 pieces within this section alone. Finding such complexity was a big plus for me, I'll definitely be buying more sets in the future!</div><div><br></div><div>Overall this is a FANTASTIC set. it's priced just right, and will provide you 20 - 30 minutes of brain-stimulating fun!</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

 own it as soon as I could. This Mini-Technic Model has won a special 
place in my collection as it is as much a favorite Mini-Technic model 
kit as my beloved Lego Technic 8290 Mini-Forktruck. In my opinion, it is
 that good of a model. <br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>The build was extremely enjoyable, the color of the bricks/liftarms 
is very eye-appealing, and the overall look of the A model, a 
mini-container, truck is really fun and a blast to fiddle with. It's a 
winner in my book. The gimmick for this kit is a container which can be 
dropped and picked up by turning a gear on top of the vehicle which 
controls a set of arms to 'hook' and 'un-hook' the container. It's a very clever design and one that I find really entertaining for its simplicity and effectiveness. <br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>The B Model is slightly less eye-appealing but does allow for the 
creation of a mini tow-truck with a lift cradle operated by turning a 
knob on the completed vehicle. I applaud the design even though it is 
not as eye-appealing as the A model. But with a Mini-Technic model, I 
expect that and accept it for what it is, and that is a creative use to 
make another model using only the parts in the kit.</p><p><br></p><p>I've enjoyed this kit so much that I've picked up a couple of extra versions over the months as the parts are exceptionally handy for some of my own experimentation. It's not too late to get this kit and I'm certainly glad and happy to have it in my collection. In short, I find it a real winner in the under $12 USD Lego Technic line. I can only hope that the 2012 Mini-Technic kit will be able to deliver the same satisfaction that this 8065 kit has with me.<br> </p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"SenatorBlutarsky","2011-03-10T11:53:12.13Z","Excellent addition to the mini Technic line","<p>I picked this set up from my local Toys R Us because for a pretty low price, it appeared to provide a model with a fairly unique function.&nbsp; I was not disappointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build took me about half an hour and was quite pleasant.&nbsp; If you are used to the larger Technic sets, there won't be any surprises, but given the size of this set, it is very well designed.&nbsp; The finished product looks about as good as it could at this scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When compared to the playability of the other mini Technic sets (and for the sake of this comparison, I take ""mini"" to mean around 100 pieces), this one really shines.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the other mini sets, it has a single function that makes use of a worm gear.&nbsp; In this case, the function is to lift the container onto or off of the truck with a pair of lifting arms that are controlled by a gear-knob on the top of the cab.&nbsp;&nbsp;This function works flawlessly.&nbsp; Not only does it smoothly lift the container in both directions, but it also securely locks the container down to the frame of the truck when the&nbsp;arms are cranked all the way to front.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of parts there is nothing really special in this set other than the container and the four mini wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the parts&nbsp;are a fairly generic set of liftarms, pins, axles, connectors, and gears (3 12T double-bevel, 1 8T, and the worm gear).&nbsp; The container, while an interesting part, is probably not going to be useful for too many other projects, and&nbsp;you can usually get a slightly&nbsp;better part/price ratio in one of the bigger Technic sets.&nbsp; This is pretty much what I expected, though, so I had no problem with the parts inventory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, this set is a winner.&nbsp; It's an excellent introduction to the Technic line.&nbsp; Veterans of Technic sets will also find it to be a fun little diversion, especially since its lifting function works so well.</p>

"asherkobin","2011-09-14T18:12:20.827Z","Awesome Small Model","<p>Picked this up as an impusle purchase.&nbsp;I just bought the Mercedes-Benz Unimog at Toys R Us and used their shipping so I have to wait.&nbsp; I had a Technic buidling itch that couldn't wait so I ""needed"" to buy something to satisfy my evening.&nbsp; Well this Mini Container Truck was it.</p>
<p>It is a model of a refuse truck that leaves behind a huge metal open-top container (usually green)&nbsp;at building contruction sites.&nbsp; Usually workers will dump used lumbar and drywall from a renovation.&nbsp; There was a Lego Town recycle truck similar to what I'm describing.&nbsp; It was red and came in a train set.&nbsp; It used some sort of grab arm mechanism underneath the container for picking up and dropping off the container.</p>
<p>Firstly, it has the dump truck part from my first Lego set as a child, the Cargo Center from 1982 or so.&nbsp; Sencondly, the realistic and amazingly precise mechanism to load and unload the bucket.&nbsp; Even the bottom angle of the exit lip plays a role in its function.&nbsp; This gets me excited because of all the parts that are between the bucket and the top screw are just a testament to the quality of Lego bricks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For customization, I will attempt to build an enclosed container to replace the bucket similar to the Town truck I described above.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
