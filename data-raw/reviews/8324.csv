At first I thought this set was too small for that, but in the end it does have a lot of parts and you can make nice MOC's out of them.<br><br>Anyway, the set itself, two models:<br>A-model is the Jeep. It has a nice wheelbase, steering and suspension. At first I thought it would be slapping around, but if you don't push it too hard, the set can follow the desk-objects quit nice<br>B-model is a buggy. Nice effect is the way of steering: just tilt the model a bit and it will steer in the appropriate way.<br><br>Below the line it is a nice set, with nice features. If you don't want to build the predefined sets, it has many other models to build, based on parts of one of the two builds. I think good value for money. And if you don't like it anymore, put the parts with the rest of your pile and start making other MOC's ;)<br>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4

"Techman","2011-11-28T19:56:28.087Z","A nice small set with good features for its size","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This was my first 2011 set before getting the 8070 super car. I picked this set up primarily because I was getting tired of my other Lego Technic stuff and wanted to get something new at a good price I was willing to pay. This set offers a cool hard spring shock element that controls both front and rear suspension. I think it was ingenious how they made that work for such a small set. The steering is pretty cool as well and doesn't use a rack and pinion like most larger Technic models do. For $20 bucks, this set only comes with 141 pieces which is a little pricey. I didn't care really about the price, I just wanted something different and from a 2011 production line. Overall, the set is good for the few pieces it has and I like how they integrated the suspension, well done designers. To conclude, this set is worth the money for the parts and to just have another set to play with. It is a good micro build that is easy and is good if you're bored and want something to do. The B-model is actually pretty good too, but I prefer the main model over the second just because it looks cooler. So go buy one!",FALSE,4,4,3,4,3

<p>The A-model looks perfectly fine and has a nice steering mechanism that I had not seen before.</p>

<p>I thought the B-model looked&nbsp;atrocious from the instructions, so I almost did not build that &nbsp;either. When I did, I was pleasantly surprised. The model looks much better than expected and the tilt-steering is actually pretty cool.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a perfectly fine set to own, but it&#39;s never going to be a favorite.</p>
