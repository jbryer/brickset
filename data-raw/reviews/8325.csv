"crazycga","2011-03-08T12:48:01.26Z","Quick Set","I picked this one up as a quick build to do that evening while watching a movie. &nbsp;It's not a large set and I'm eyeballing the 8053 Mobile Crane, so I'm just wishing... &nbsp;But back to this one. &nbsp;It's a small set, clocking in at 292 pieces. &nbsp;The build is very simple, and the scale is totally different from all of the other Technic sets this year.<div><br></div><div>In all, the build took me a half hour of concentrated effort. &nbsp;I'm not a large fan of the string spool, never really have been. &nbsp;The mobility functions are very simple, which is acceptable given the scale of the model (i.e. the turntable is accomplished using a simple stud.) &nbsp;What I really do like about this model is the extending legs. &nbsp;I feel they're very cleverly implemented. &nbsp;What I don't like about it is the steering mechanism. &nbsp;It's a very small and compact design, but I think it's a bit of a cheat. &nbsp;As a result the rotational range of the turning mechanism is less that 1/4 turn. &nbsp;(I've seen better, that's all.) &nbsp;The extension piece is interesting, but impossible to extend in a ""controlled"" manner because of the friction method used to hold it in place.</div><div><br></div><div>A fun little set, and at the price it was fine. &nbsp;It's part of the construction set that now litters my desk at work.</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4
"hollywood_heidke","2011-03-13T22:15:20.923Z","First Technic Set","This was my first Technic set and I was thoroughly pleased with the purchase.&nbsp; The build was new and enjoyable to a Technic newbie.&nbsp; The pieces were unique to me.&nbsp; The many functions of the set were interesting to see develop over the course of the build.&nbsp; They were also fun to use/play with after the build was complete.&nbsp; The fun I had with this set will likely lead to more Technic purchases in the future.&nbsp; While I will always be more inclined to buy a themed Lego set, I will now give a second look to all Technic sets I run across.&nbsp; Bravo again, Lego. :)<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"Thunder_gryphoN","2011-07-16T18:30:03.47Z","A clever and interesting set for the beginner and pro alike.","<p>I bought this set on a whim, being that I like construction machinery, especially cranes. The A-model was an absolute joy to put together, with no tricky or repetitive areas. Despite being simple and having no particularly special parts, the truck chassis shows an exceptional amount of thought and cleverness having been put into it with the steering mechanism that takes advantage of the play between parts and the sturdy, functional outriggers, as well as a highly detailed cab.</p><p>The B-model is also fairly detailed and retains the same steering mechanism as the crane, as well as a reasonably detailed exterior. For both models, I recommend squishing the steering parts together so the friction helps keep the steering from turning by itself when the models are rolling.<br></p><p>My biggest gripe about this set is that it uses a single 8t spur gear to lift the crane and tow truck arm. Such an arrangement produces an extreme amount of force on the spur gear, limiting lifting capacity of both models to almost nothing. Additionally, this makes the spur gear very easy to break. A much better solution would have been to use an arrangement to that on the 8270 Rough Terrain Crane, which is far more robust yet still compact. In my own view, the lifting mechanism makes for a serious hit to the otherwise excellent playability as the crane can't be used for lifting and is fragile, yet the chassis makes a reasonably sturdy base. Despite this puzzling flaw, the set is very enjoyable to drive around, deploy, then stow again. <br></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Outstanding crane truck chassis<br></li><li>Very clever and compact steering mechanism</li><li>Functional outriggers</li><li>Fun to play with, looks great as a display</li><li>Easy, yet exciting assembly<br></li><li>Affordable</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Fragile lifting mechanism doesn't allow for lifting of significant loads</li></ul>Set 8067 is a fun, low-cost set that I recommend to any Technic fan, novice or experienced, for it is a pleasant build and overall quite well designed. <br>",TRUE,4,3,5,3,4
