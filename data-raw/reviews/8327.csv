"hga09","2010-12-20T18:54:21.703Z","Possibly the best non-motorized LEGO Technic construction vehicle since 8455","8069 is an excellent design in terms of functionality. The philosophy behind this design appears to be maximum functionality with the fewest parts. 8069 may not be nearly as good looking as the 8265 (front loader) of last year or the 8294 (excavator) from 2008, but it has a lot of neat tricks up its sleeve.<br><br>The new compact (mini) linear actuators (mLAs) introduced with this model perform smoothly. Mechanically, these appear to be a much better fit for manually operated Technics designs. Unlike the larger fully encapsulated linear actuator designs that were introduced with the 8294, mLAs don't require you to turn the knobs forever to get a useful range of motion. You also get to see exactly what is going on in terms of mechanical coupling.<br><br>The mechanical design design for the front bucket (lift and tilt functions) is simple but it works quite well. The only complaint may be that the maximum lift for the bucket is relatively limited. There are two gear-knobs on either side of the model that can control the lift. I am not sure if this was intended for the convenience of both left-handed and right-handed builders, but it does work quite effectively to increase the speed with which the bucket can be raised by using both hands to turn alternating knobs simultaneously.<br><br>The yellow translucent 2x2 round brick on the top of the cab controls steering. The steering system works is simple but smooth with decent range of motion on turns.The two black gear-knobs on top of the rear side of the cab control the excavator arm. Probably because it is difficult to transfer rotational motion to a linear actuator on the second segment of the excavator arm for a small model, 8069 uses two linear actuators at the bottom section of the arm to drive both the arm motion and bucket motion independently. It does look a bit different from a typical excavator arm design that was used in 8455, 8294, 8043, etc., but it works well. There is third knob that controls the rotation of the excavator arm around the vertical axis. In order to support the rotation of the excavator arm, rotational motion from the gear-knobs is coupled from to the back-hoe subsystem through a pair of universal joints.<br><br>Finally, there are two support arms that can be extended and locked in place manually at the rear section to stabilize the vehicle when the excavator arm is being used. The overall build for 8069 is relatively straight forward, at least for an experienced Technics fan. There are a few steps where relatively large subassemblies come togehter and axles need to be fitted carefully. Instructions are are quite clear, though a bit too simple for my taste. There are many steps where only one or two parts are added to the model. There are a few stickers but they all go on single tiles (1x8 and 2x2). <br><br>LEGO was able to deliver a very playable and multi-functional construction vehicle with both a loading bucket and a back-hoe for under $60. They did have to leave out some nice-to-have details such as a working engine with pistons, more body panels, etc. to keep the scale small and the price of the model relatively low but IMHO this was a good trade-off. 8069 is definitely the highlight of the 2011 Technics line so far - though flagship Technics models (e.g. Unimog) are expected in 2H'11. 8069 will likely find it's place in the Technics hall-of-fame of medium-scale models in the near future.",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4

I, for example, got tired from all the motorised models; it's exagerated, too many models have power functions these days (I have already many battery boxes and cabels, of which many are not even compatible ). It's a better experience if you control the functions by hand, this insures that the model is complex, well-thought-out and worthy of the Technic name.

"wrathofgod22","2011-02-06T09:46:31.627Z","An improved back hoe!","<p>Having read the previous 2 reviews, I would like to compare 8069 with his elder brother 8455 of 2003. 8455 was my first Technic set and I really loved the pneumatic functions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Size - Both are of the same proportion with identical buckets and rear wheels. However 8455 has smaller front wheels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steering - Both uses HOG but I'm having some problems with 8455 :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engine - 8455 has a V3 engine while 8069 has none.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Functionality - 8069 definitely works better for me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stickers - 8069 has a few while 8455 has none.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appearance - 8455 has a more impressive look with the amount of pistons!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall IMO 8069 is a simplified version of 8455 yet improved with better functionalities. It's a must buy for all Technic fans!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

"SenatorBlutarsky","2011-01-26T15:56:31.48Z","Incredible value!","<p>I have to agree with everything hga09 said.&nbsp; This set packs an incredible amount of functionality into a fairly modest size package.&nbsp; Here is a short summary of the functions is this model:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Front-wheel rank-and-pinion steering (via beacon light on the top of the cab).</li>
    <li>Hood that can be raised.</li>
    <li>Loader bucket that can be raised/lowered (via gear-knobs on either side of the engine compartment) and tilted (via turning the exhaust stack in the front).</li>
    <li>Rear outriggers that are individually deployed via lever mechanisms.</li>
    <li>Excavator arm that can be raised/lowered and extended via two gear-knobs on the top of the cab) and swiveled (via a gear-knob on the side to the rear of the cab)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the really neat things about this model is how well the control knobs are integrated into the overall design.&nbsp; The exhaust stack and beacon light serve as both aesthetic and functional elements.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It's hard to imagine getting too much more for your money.&nbsp; The only cons I would note are that the mechanisms that control both the loader bucket and the excavator arm are not as close to being authentic as in some of the larger sets.&nbsp; For instance. the tilting of the loader bucket is controlled via a lever mechanism that extends all the way back to the body, rather than by a set of linear actuators attached directly to the loader arms themselves.&nbsp; Given the size of this set, it's hard to really fault it for those simplifications.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would love to see LEGO produce a large loader-backhoe set (i.e. a flagship set with 1500+ pieces), with power functions and linear actuators controlling all of the loader and excavator operations.&nbsp; That would have to rank up among the best Technic sets ever.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"sbasak","2012-02-28T05:51:06.343Z","One of the best non-motorized sets","<b>Packaging</b><br>
<br>
I bought a Lego after a long time. In fact, this is my first studless 
set. I was quite excited to start building as soon as I opened the box. 
However, I was disappointed on the packing. In old days, Lego used to 
insert a tray with pockets to hold parts in plastic containers. Now 
there is no such plastic tray inside! Just the sealed plastic bags with 
parts inside. The wheels and front bucket were just bundled as loose 
parts. Also, Lego now only includes instruction for main model. The B 
model instructions must be downloaded. What the heck? Cost cutting at 
its extreme?<br>
<br>
Building it was time consuming consider the model does not have too many
 parts (609 to be precise). This is due to the fact that parts were not 
well sorted in bags. It took me 3.5 hours to construct the model. 
Initial steps were longer as I had to delve thru all parts. It became 
much quicker from part 2 of instruction booklet.<br>
<br>
<b>The model</b><br>
<br>
The finished model was quite big. It spanned the length of a typical computer monitor (17-19 inch). The functions are:<br>
<br>
<ul style=""text-align: left;""><li>Hand of God steering (the steering in cab is dummy) operating front wheels although turning radius is quite large.</li><li>The two black cogs on either side of the model raise/lower the front bucket. The vertical rod tilts the bucket.</li><li>There are two out triggers at the rear, which you can raise/lower using handles.</li><li>The backhoe assembly in rear can be rotated as a whole using worm 
gears (its bit loose and has considerable free movement as well).</li><li>There are two knobs (cogs) at the top of cab, one raises/lowers the 
backhoe arm and one extends it in/outward to operate the backhoe.</li><li>The bonnet of engine bay can be opened (but there is no engine inside by the way).</li></ul><br>
Overall, a good playability. Aesthetically it is a pleasing one. I heard
 that studless models look nicer than studded ones. As this is my first 
studless model, I think this claim is actually true. My previous studded
 Lego sets look quite blocky. Did not use the stickers - I hate them.<br>
<br>
This is the first time I used linear actuators. These convert rotational
 movement into linear movement. It is analogous to old pneumatic pistons
 but instead of air pressure, it works via linear movement.<br>
<br>
<b>Overall Impression</b><br>
<br>
I would give this set a score of 9 out of 10. There are many functions 
and this set bucks the latest trend of providing motors in almost every 
Technic sets! I prefer pure Technic without any motor. The joy of seeing
 action via hands pushing cogs is totally different. <br>
<br>
This set has lots of special parts (but then I have not played Lego for a
 long time). This somewhat restricts what you can create of your own. 
Don't know whether I'd ever create the B model (especially without a 
printed instruction - shame Lego).",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5
"Gandalf1","2012-04-30T11:05:23.833Z","""OK, just... one... more... peg...""","<p>This is my first ever Technic set, and it is very cool, and worth the money. I got it at the LEGO Store, and am very pleased with it. Now, the review:</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div><b>Box</b></div><div>The box was good. On the front, it shows the main model, with a small picture demonstrating the functions. On the back it shows the B-model, a log-handler. Overall, the box was not amazing, but not bad.</div><div><b>Instructions</b></div><div>The instructions were understandable, but had some issues. First of all, there were a few times when they told you to assemble some part of it in the most confusing way possible. <b>EDIT: <i>There used to be a sentence here about a problem I had, but I realized it was just my own mistake.</i></b>&nbsp;Also, in step #76, when it shows how to attach the front scooper-thing, if you follow their instructions exactly, you'll stress the pieces! You have to bend technic beams out of the way in order to put something in between them.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Lots of tight technic pegs! 50, to be exact There were also lots of very useful gears, axles, technic beams, and tires. I was blown away when I opened the set and saw the front shovel/scooper/thing. It is <b>HUGE</b>. There were some stickers, but they weren't too difficult to line up, and they weren't that necessary. I kind of like stickers most of the time, but I know many of you on Brickset don't, so you'll be pleased to know that they don't add that much to the model. Oh, and the mirrors are not actually shiny. It's just a gradient.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Hehe. ;) It's bigger than minifigure scale.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Difficult at times, and what I figured out is, when you can't seem to get a part to attach, push harder! But not too hard! You don't want to break the pieces. It took me around 3 hours to build. Yeah, it's complicated, but the results (see below) are worth it!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Very awesome looking, and bigger than expected, which is always a plus for me. The tires roll very well on carpet or wood. It has so many functions:</p><p></p><ul><li>Raise and lower the front scooper-thing</li><li>Tilt it&nbsp;forward&nbsp;and backward</li><li>Use the light on the roof to steer the front wheels (The steering wheel doesn't do anything.)</li><li>Extend the side-thingamabobs that help support it</li><li>Turn the rear shovel left and right</li><li>Raise and lower the rear shovel</li><li>Tilt it forward and backward in a digging motion.</li></ul>All of these functions are done using turning axles that are easily accessible.<p></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>This is a very fun set, and can probably be motorized, although it wasn't designed with that in mind. Very good value for the money, at 9.85c per piece. I definitely like Technic more, now that I have this set. If you like cool gear functions and/or vehicles, this set is for you. You will not be&nbsp;disappointed!</div>",TRUE,4,5,2,5,5
"DrFrankenstein","2012-05-18T20:15:30.68Z","Not as luxurious as 8455, but still a very nice set","This set back-hoe is a remake of the well known and respected 8455 model from 2003. It copies the scale and style from its predecessor even borrowing the same buckets. The main differences are the control mechanisms, the lack of an engine, and the larger front tires. Because the 8069 does not have all the pneumatic cylinders, pumps, and hoses of 8455, it sports a leaner look.<br><br>There is noting particularly remarkable in the build process of 8069. The 8455 is much more of a challenge with its intricate maze of hoses that need to be routed correctly. The turn-knob controls of the new model feel responsive and precise, with the exception of the arm swinging mechanism, which uses a worm gear and has way too much free play. The rear stabilizers are a bit of a disappointment with their flimsy rod controls, but then again the 8455 stabilizer aren't perfect either, because they don't lock securely into place when deployed and feel soft because of the pneumatic component to them.<br><br>In terms of playability, the knob turning gets tiring rather quickly (it takes a lot of revolutions to induce a substantial motion in the linear actuators). The constant need to pump the 8455 also taxing, but, boy does that change once you hook up a compressor to it ... then all you have to do is flip the valves and the pneumatics take care of the rest.  It doesn't look like adding power functions to the 8069 would be an easy feat (and cheap either) - it simply wasn't designed for it. At any rate such a move will defeat it's beautiful simplicity of a hand-driven model. In this regard, it just can't replicate the experience of driving the 8455 powered by a compressor.<br><br>The loss of the engine in 8069 doesn't seem like a major step back. Yes, it does kill a bit of the realism and makes it look cheaper. On the upside this change is what makes the 8069 roll around effortlessly with much less drag than the 8455.<br><br>Finally, the steering of 8069 is not as jumpy as 8455, but its turning radius is limited. Changing the restricting pins as described by one of the previous review does improve the steering angles almost to the level of 8455.<br><br>In summary, the 8069 and 8455 look very similar on the outside, but the mechanics are very different in pretty much every aspect. LEGO has outdone itself managing to pack a ton of functions and looks into 8069 at a very reasonable price. The tradeoff here is that this model doesn't have the luxurious feel of pneumatic valve controls, the engine, and the stabilizers of the 8455, which remains the reigning king of the Technic back-hoes.<br> ",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5

I like medium sized sets, where developer managed to pack lots of smart solutions using limited number of parts and restricted space. Construction machinery is also my favourite Technic subtheme. Sum these up, put in some specialized parts as a bonus and take my money. That's the way 8069 is - great, classic Technic set.
