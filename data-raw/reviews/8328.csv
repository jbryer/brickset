"smallman28","2011-01-25T17:28:18.163Z","Only my 4th set but very impressed","<p>Let me start by saying this is only the 4th Technic set I have built so my observations might not be of the usual standard&nbsp;that people are used to.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how many parts there are in this set but it was enough to keep me amsued for a few hours.</p>
<p>What looks lke it might be a complictaed build turns out to be not the case.</p>
<p>I like a challenge so when I get a new set I just open all the bags into the box so it takes me a bit longer to rummage around to find the bit I need.</p>
<p>Despite this I built it in about 3-4 hours so more experienced builders might be done in half that.</p>
<p>Overall I think it is a great set but there are a few things that bug me a bit.</p>
<p>The bonnet/hood opens for you to be able to see the engine so why is the bonnet so see through in its construction?</p>
<p>A few more bits in the bonnet would have made it look fuller&nbsp;and not so skeletal which for me slightly spoils the overall effect.</p>
<p>The front light sections&nbsp;are only held in in one fixing point,its not a big deal but they are on the wobbly side along with the whole front end.</p>
<p>Its BIG,well not massive,but its quite substantial when built in terms of lenght and width.</p>
<p>The power functions work well althought the bonnet&nbsp;lowers so far down before it just seems to drop on its own and then just at the&nbsp;last moment it lowers correctly again.</p>
<p>Overall I like this set despite the couple of niggles I have with it.</p>

<P style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"" class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first Lego review I have written. Please keep that in mind as you read through. Additionally, I did not build the second model or apply stickers.</p>
<P style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"" class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"" class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp; This set contains 1281 pieces. There are two bags of black friction pins and two bags of blue axle pins in this set. This set also has a large number of gears, including one Mindstorms 24 tooth clutch gear. Many body panel pieces are also included, as can be seen in the pictures. When I cut open the bags and started sorting, I was quite overwhelmed. I usually sort pieces into kid’s-style kitchen plates (You know, the ones with divisions for the food!) and with this set I ran out of plates. I sorted the remaining pieces and put them back into the bags until needed.</p>
<P style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"" class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"" class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent about 7 hours building this set, including the time it took to sort the pieces. I was quite satisfied with the building experience, especially the way the gearbox was constructed. I have not built a Technic set that has used a gear box before. The mesh of the gears is easy to obtain, but the mesh of the two red clutches and clutch extensions is a bit picky. There are times when I need to jiggle the gear shift knob to get the clutch to pop into place. I believe this is caused by just a bit too much “play” in there. I may need to squish the gears together a bit. This set uses HOG steering but does not use the yellow, 4 tooth gears that are usually employed here. Instead, 12-tooth gears are used. I see no functional difference and, indeed, the yellow gears would stand out like a sore thumb on this set.</p>
<P style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"" class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"" class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp; The V8 engine is very nice, although it could have easily been a V10 as there is room. A V10 would have been more in scale as well; the V8 is a bit too small for this model. That is a very nit picky complaint though! I am pleased at being able to see the engine while the car is in motion. Some sets have tucked the engine away, negating (to some degree) the reason for having one. The engine driveline uses gearing to step around the gear box in the center of the car. Also, two universal joints are employed as the rear axle is out of line with the drive train. It is quite realistic.</p>
<P style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"" class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<P style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"" class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had no problems with the power functions in this set. The doors, hood, and tailfin all function well. When closing the hood, before the clutch gear kicks in, you can see the front of the car “tighten up” a bit as the worm gear binds up. This is typical of the set up used in raising or lowering the hood and presents no problems. In fact, I like to tighten the hood down all the way before switching the motor off. The rear hatch is simply on a hinge and the tailfin pushes it out of the way when extending or retracting. The doors not only swing up, but also swing out in the same motion. I like how they work and look.</p>

"N11634","2011-03-19T23:47:04.62Z","Pretty good, but.....","<p>Well, My first review, my 7th or 8th Technic....I lose track.&nbsp; I have returned from a 20+ year leave of absence.&nbsp; In the last few months, I've built the Motorized Excavator, the Crane Truck, a few Mindstorms models, a few smaller Technics with my son, and the 8880 Super Car (Yes, THE super car...Thank you, eBay).&nbsp; I'm not sure why I kept it in my head that I was going to compare this model to the 8880.&nbsp; They're 17 years apart in production, so there's very few parts that either set has in common aside from the V-8 Engine.&nbsp; If you're looking for my preference, I like the 8880 better. ;-)</p>
<p>...But I digress.&nbsp; Back to the model at hand.&nbsp; After building so many current Technic sets, this one just feels different.&nbsp; It doesn't look as finished as other sets.&nbsp; The body parts don't mesh or flow like other sets.&nbsp; The Crane truck and excavator make great use of the body panels and they have this great finished look.&nbsp; The body on this car just looks tacked together.&nbsp; I hate to bash it too bad, a sports car usually has flowing curves and the designers did the best they could with the body panels and flex pieces they have.&nbsp; Honestly, the ""B"" model (T-Bucket-style roadster)&nbsp;looks better in my opinion...but I haven't built it as of yet.</p>
<p>The build went well and maintains that Technic ""feel"" throughout and it's a neat use of the power functions.&nbsp; It's unfortunate that for just one ""M""&nbsp;motor, you need this honkin' battery box sticking out the back of it, though.&nbsp; As usual, they did a great job incorporating the battery box to make battery changes easy.&nbsp; A suggestion would be molding the battery box in different colors to go with the model a bit better and not stick out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>The steering is a bit sticky around center.&nbsp; I haven't isolated the problem, but it may be the stickiness in the wheel hubs.&nbsp; They fit quite tightly into the ""A"" arms in the suspension.&nbsp; More suspension travel would have been nice, but I understand it's a sports car and they just don't have&nbsp;a lot to begin with.</p>
<p>Overall, the design is great&nbsp; I agree with the other reveiwers that the front end could have been a bit more sturdy, and a V-10 would have been&nbsp;cool.&nbsp; It does have a neat look when you get down to it's level and look it right in the grill.&nbsp; It looks eerily similar to an American car (some sort of snake, I believe), changed just enough to avoid litigation.&nbsp; Maybe the V-10 was where they drew the line to avoid licensing fees!&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>I do recommend this model.&nbsp; It's still very cool despite my little hang-ups about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>- Lotsa pieces. 
<li>- Nice complicated build. 
<li>- Interesting use of Power Functions. 
<li>- Very large model and displays well. 
<li>- Many must-have parts. 
<li>- All-wheel suspension. 
<li>- Interesting use of the shifter.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>- Skeletal look, not terribly attractive. 
<li>- Flimsy (but not fragile) front end. 
<li>- Body feels tacked together. 
<li></li></ul>
<p>I still like the kit.&nbsp; I'd recomment it to any Technic fan, but I just wish the body flowed better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>UPDATE!&nbsp; I have now completed the B model.&nbsp; I know it's been a long time, but my summers are busy.&nbsp; For those not familiar, it's&nbsp;a T-Bucket style roadster with opening&nbsp;suicide doors and a retractible top; Both run by the shifter like the A model.&nbsp; The functions open both doors at once and the shifter only has forward and backward as directions, no left to right slide. </p><p>I will probably not&nbsp;gain any favor with many when I say that the B model&nbsp;should have been the A model.&nbsp; It may just be because I'm a&nbsp;classic car&nbsp;fan at heart, but it REALLY looks sharp.&nbsp; It also displays much better, in my opinion.&nbsp; </p><p>The build was enjoyable as always.&nbsp; It basically works it's way from the back to the front during the build, so the hard stuff is covered first.&nbsp;The rear suspension is a bit sticky, but the front is silky smooth.&nbsp; The frame will bottom out if you compress it, much like a typical street rod would being so low to the ground.</p><p>The retractible top and doors have a lot of slack in the drivelines, probably because of the worm gear assemblies.&nbsp; The motor runs for quite a long time before the functions actually move, but it's a minor issue.&nbsp; It would have been nice to see the doors open seperately, but it's still a well thought out design.&nbsp; </p><p>I'm going to keep it in this form to display.&nbsp; It really looks very cool, even with the stickers for the A model still on it.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The 3&nbsp;instructional&nbsp;manuals and sticker set &nbsp;were all included on a piece of cardboard to prevent bending. &nbsp;I never saw the appeal of rating the box.</p>

(actually a little over 4 pounds). &nbsp;many parts I am familiar form my previous technic builds (clutch gear,&nbsp;differential) and many 2 and 3 stud friction pins. &nbsp;it includes a bunch of (x8) gears with smooth holes that can spin freely around the axle, a V8 Engine, and a lot of flex pieces</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I wake at 4h to catch a 5h bus to work. &nbsp;I finally get home (usually!) at 17h30. &nbsp;so thats my excuse for taking almost 3 days to complete her. &nbsp;i quite enjoy the complex&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;sets because they contain the looks and functionality. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Larger than i was expecting! &nbsp;She's about 19"" long and 8.5"" wide and weighs 4lbs (about the size of a small newborn!). &nbsp;I'm not happy with the fact the battery box&nbsp;requires&nbsp;6 (!!)

"Zapp_Brannigan","2011-05-20T21:36:35.777Z","Extremely well done but not perfect","I got this set recently via Lego Shop At Home. I never had a real Technic car set, so this is my first one ever. I was very excited to build it and see how everything worked. Overall, everything worked out quite well, but there are a few problems here and there; I will talk about them shortly.<div><br></div><div>When you open the box, you get a total of 13 bags, one of which contains the instructions and sticker sheet; this time, Lego placed the instructions and stickers in a bag so they don't become wrinkled. You should have 10 bags of pieces and two bags storing the battery box and motor.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The entire set took me around 8.5 to 9 hours to build. Unlike previously, this time I sorted all my pieces into individual piles, and I must say, it was extremely easy to find what I was looking for. I'm sure that if I piled all the pieces into a large pile, it would have taken me 11+ hours to build. Like many large Technic sets, the build was fairly challenging and there are several instances in the instructions where you have to pay close attention to (i.e. when you put the clutch gears in, you have to put them in on the proper side).</div><div><br></div><div>Once completed, I was very impressed with the model. Aesthetically, this set scores maximum points; the large number of panels and flexible tubing give the car a sleek, realistic look. The wide array of working gears gives the set a very technical feeling (hence the name Technic!). The model is amazingly large, measuring at 46 cm x 18 cm x 13 cm (length x width x height, respectively), and it is also quite heavy, I would estimate around 2.5-3 kilograms including the battery box, which accounts for around 25-30% of the total weight.</div><div><br></div><div>Basic details include things such as seats, steering wheel, grille, bumper, headlights, brake lights, and stickers which gave the car more realistic details. Functional parts include the hand-of-god steering, V-8 engine, four-wheel independent suspension, and Power Functions which control the opening of the hood, spoilers, and doors. The Power Functions is controlled by a ""transmission"" gearbox that can be switched to control the hood, doors, or spoilers. To open something you must put the switch on forward (which is to your right when the battery box is oriented sideways in the rear of the car), and vice versa when you want to close everything. Even though in real life you would NEVER use the transmission to control these functions, in this set it is still fun to operate, and it works quite well. The structure of the car is fairly sturdy, reinforced from top to bottom; however, I don't recommend severe abuse (such as purposefully dropping the car to test its strength).</div><div><br></div><div>To me, the most outstanding problem was the suspension. When you build the front suspension, you have to compress the spring in order to lock it in. This is due to the fact that the spring is 6.5 studs long, and the vertical distance between the bottom of the spring and the locking hole is 6 studs long. As a result, the spring is out of alignment and needs to be compressed slightly to lock it in (You will know what I'm talking about when you build it). Because the design is very specific, you will have to dismantle the entire front section to create modifications. Also, the front suspension does not go down very far, otherwise the bottom of the car will hit the ground.&nbsp;The rear suspension, on the other hand was fairly stiff; if you push down on it you can feel its hesitance to spring back up. This can easily be fixed by adding another spring to each wheel; although it will not reduce stiffness, the springing force will be improved.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>When the Power Functions is in operation, you have to pay attention when to start and stop the motor. For example, if you are opening the hood and it is opened to its maximum position, you cannot leave the motor running because it will jam and possibly cause damage (you will be able to hear the motor begin to strain). The same rule applies for the doors and spoilers, and for closing.</div><div><br></div><div>Another complaint I have is that the steering wheel is strictly ornamental, serving no purpose in doing what it's supposed to do.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, I was very impressed with this set. At $154.99 CAD it is a great deal considering all the things you get such as Power Functions. I would recommend this set to all Technic fans, but if you are a serious collector I would check around for other reviews and details before buying this set. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"sakuraL","2011-06-29T04:53:17.313Z","A nice one : )","<p>As others have already pointed out and described most features of this set, I might just make my review shorter by making a concise pro &amp; con list.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>1. Instruction guides came with a cardboard in a bag: hopefully from now on, all instruction guides will be crumple-free!&nbsp;</li><li>2. Wide range of pieces: This set comes with many different pieces, and obviously, a lot of them are red. A motor and a battery box are included (you might start thinking and working it out already where to install them other then n to this set...)</li><li>3. Motor function! : As explained above.</li><li>4. Great building experience: Very few repeated building and steps, it makes you impossible to get tired of building whether or not you want to finish building the whole thing in one go.&nbsp;</li><li>5. Being concrete and strong: In general, most parts do stick together firmly. Lots of pin-to-hole work makes it very concrete.&nbsp;</li><li>6. High complexity: I believe most Technic fans would love complex building experience, the more complex the better. The gear work in this set is very complicated, and very packed. Some pieces are hard to set into their place because space is very limited for you to put your finger there to hold it tightly.&nbsp;</li><li><br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>1. Bags are not numbered: I had had the impression that sets of recent years have their bags numbered for easy building and sorting. I was surprised that they didn't this time. Having some 1200-ish pieces all in this box at the same time was a little inconvenient, especially there are quite a number of big red&nbsp;panels&nbsp;and gear-related pieces.&nbsp;</li><li>2. Appearance: As others have pointed out (and other critiques out there on the internet) that the look of this set is a little ""skeletal"", especially at the front in my opinion. Probably the V8 engine should be hided from view first, then the motor function can raise the hood to reveal the engine. I guess it would be more appealing that way (for example, when you are showing off your set to other people). However, Model B does not have this issue.&nbsp;</li><li>3. Hard to remove battery box: In the Main Model, the batter box is placed in a rather ""difficult"" location: You will have to pull 2 red pins out in order to take the battery box out, and the 2 pins are half-hidden by panels. But in Model B, I can see the placing of battery box is better planned, as in, not stuffing it to the back in the last minute of the build.&nbsp;</li><li>4. Another minor issue is that a particular group of pieces was near impossible to deconstruct! You will need a lot of strength for it and it nearly broke my nail. You will need to deconstruct those pieces if you want to build Model B after the Main one.&nbsp;</li><li>5. A little disappointed that the motor function does not include running the car forward &nbsp;@_@ . It was only meant for the doors, hood and the spoiler.&nbsp;</li><li><br></li></ul><div>To conclude:</div><div>A great set with a reasonable price and a great set in your collection :)&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
"SenatorBlutarsky","2011-09-16T10:50:31.123Z","Solid set, but a few minor issues","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought this set used a few months ago, but I've been pretty busy, so I didn't get around to building it until last week.&nbsp; What attracted me to it were the power functions and drive train/axle parts that would be useful for MOCing my own cars.&nbsp; Despite the fact that my review focuses on some of the shortcomings of this set, my overall impression of it is pretty positive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Build</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build took me about 6 hours in total (spread out over 3 sessions).&nbsp; It probably would have taken me closer to 5 hours to complete if I were working with a brand new set -- I&nbsp;bought the set used and the pieces were completely unsorted, so I probably spent about an extra hour searching for parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I'd have to say the build was very satisfying.&nbsp; There's a good amount of complexity and very few repititive tasks.&nbsp; As with most Technic builds, the process starts with the central gearbox and works its way outward.&nbsp; The major sub-assemblies are the gearbox, the rear axle/differential, the front axle/steering mechanism, and the doors.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, let me say that the power functions all work great.&nbsp; The doors, hood, and spoiler all work flawlessly and the clutch gear completely eliminates the gear grinding that you get in some of the other sets (e.g. the 8052 Container Truck).&nbsp; I particularly like how the rear ""hatch"" moves up and down to allow the spoiler extend and retract and how the doors open at an angle to simulate the movement of butterfly doors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, I have a few gripes related to the design of this model (although, to be fair, I knew about these issues before I bought it, so they were obviously not serious enough to discourage me from spending money on it):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>It feels wrong to me that there is a gearbox where the transmission should be, but it is not actually a transmission.&nbsp; Perhaps I feel this way because I got back into LEGOs just recently, so I missed my chance at the 8880 Supercar, 8448 Super Street Sensation, and 8466 4x4 Off Roader&nbsp;sets. &nbsp;I'd like to build a set with a real transmission. 
<li>While the power doors and hood are an interesting build, I don't think that they are a particularly good application of power functions.&nbsp; In my opinion, all three of these features would have a more realistic feel to them if they were operated by a damped spring&nbsp;or&nbsp;rubber band in combination with some kind of catch/release mechansim, similar to what was done for the doors in the 8454 Rescue Truck.&nbsp; I'm not intimately familiar with the fancy doors on the&nbsp;Ferraris, Lamborghinis, McLarens, etc., but my guess would be that they are all driven by a spring or gas strut rather than a motor. &nbsp;A better application of power functions would be&nbsp;to operate features that are normally powered in real life, such as a retractable convertible roof, pop-up headlights,&nbsp;or an active suspension. 
<li>Finally (this is a problem I have with many of the motorized Technic sets), the way the control switches work for the power functions seems awkward to me.&nbsp; Consider the way a power window works in a typical car.&nbsp; You push the switch one way to open it and the other way to close it.&nbsp; Ideally, that's the way the controls for the doors, hood and spoiler should work as well.&nbsp; Instead, you have to engage the correct gear in the gearbox and then go all the way to back of the car to flip the battery power switch into the right position.</li></ul>
<p>In addition to those design issues, there were several other minor problems, most of which have already been reported by the other reviewers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The front suspension is very stiff and has very little travel. 
<li>The steering is a little stiff, but not enough to be a real problem. 
<li>Removing the battery is a little difficult because the pins that hold it in are partially hidden behind body panels. 
<li>You have to be a little careful when picking the car up, because the front end and many of the body panels are somewhat flimsy -- several of the body panels are attached with just a single 2L axle.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Appearance</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll agree with some of the other reviewers that the body panels seem patched together to some extent, and therefore don't create a flowing body shape.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;I think&nbsp;the discontinuities in the panels may actually improve the appearance in some ways.&nbsp; In particular, the gaps between the front fender panels and the door panels are reminiscent of the giant brake vents of the&nbsp;Dodge Viper (particularly the first two generations).&nbsp; The use of flex axles to simulate the windshield and other glass components is also pretty good.&nbsp; The rear end (as others have pointed out) is somewhat bulky and unattractive, but that was probably necessary to create the space for the battery box.&nbsp; Furthermore, that kind of rear end is fairly typical of American high-end sports&nbsp;cars -- take a look at the Viper or Corvette (which, I'll concede, are not truly ""supercars"").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is full of great parts, especially if you plan on building some supercars of your own.&nbsp; The axle assemblies, including the control arms, the steering hubs, narrow differential, and CV joints are a good starting point for any vehicle MOC.&nbsp; In addition, you get the power functions, including the all-important clutch gear, as well as a huge array of red liftarms, panels, and flex axles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The power features in this set&nbsp;all work very well,&nbsp;and the parts will certainly be useful later on.&nbsp; Also, although other may disagree, my opinion is that the A model Super Car looks pretty good when it is built.&nbsp; For those reasons, I'd have to say that this set was money well spent, even if it does have a few minor issues.&nbsp; </p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4

"fatalleader","2011-06-11T15:56:46.57Z","Misnomer","This set is, I believe, a misnomer. Super cars, such as the Ferrari Enzo, Lamborghini Aventador, and Mercedes CLK all have their engines mid-mount (or what I call rear-mount, as it's behind the passenger area). This car is more of a sports car, or, if you really want to get technical, a Chevy Corvette. Sports cars, such as the Chevy Corvette, Ferrari California, Dodge Viper, and BMW Z4 all have front-mount engines. There are exceptions to this, since Porches have rear-mounts and the more common ones are sports cars.<br>The cost averaging I've figured out is that 1 brick is anywhere from five cents to a dime in US dollars. Now, some bricks cost even less (I think the lowest is three cents) and some are more (the NXT CPU is about $100, since it's a computer processor), but a minimum of 100 bricks is about $10 in the US.<br>The reason I said Playability was a 3 was because it's more of a display model.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
"DrFrankenstein","2013-07-15T00:39:36.357Z","Very nice supercar","<p>I agree with mostly everything said about this model. This nice looking and massive supercar is a great addition to the Technic lines, even if it does not break lots of new ground.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The building instructions for this set work fine, but are not the best I've seen. It seems like the instruction designers have tried to please both the AFOL crowd and the junior builders here. There were at least 6 steps in the instructions that are confusing and guaranteed to result in mistakes (luckily not too bad to correct once detected). Clearly, LEGO skimped on testing the instruction sets thoroughly with kids in mind. Yet, in many instances the instructions get way too patronizing with oversimplified 1-pin steps. It's an example where Technic's competing objectives of providing a complex build yet easy to follow instructions targeted towards kids are at major odds with each other. <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Tons of red bricks in this set with some blacks and grays intermixed. Red has been the color of the Technic supercars of the 21st century and this one is no exception from the pack. That's fine, but I wish the designers would try having some fun with other color schemes. Also, there is not too much variety in the parts - lots of liftarms, panels, and other usual suspects.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The early part of the build is somewhat slow focusing on the transmission and developing some support structures around it. Once the chassis starts to take shape though and the functions routing starts to emerge, the build picks some speed and becomes interesting (from the 2nd booklet on).<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The finished car looks great overall and is impressive in size. On the plus side, the chassis is very solid. On the minus side, as others have pointed out already, the panels and other decorations on the outside seem patchy and attached just so they don't fall apart on their own. Also, I don't like the use of soft bending axles in this model. Still, I think the designer did a great job in adding some curves to this car's looks.</p><p>The suspension is low, as it should be for a sports car. The steering is a bit stiff and the turning radius is too wide, but it's not too bad. The functions are interesting and so is the choice of using the transmission to switch between them. It's not exactly something one would spend lots of time playing with after trying it all once. I am not sure if the motorization of the set was a great decision, but the lack of a polarity switch is a mistake. The switch on the battery box is just not good for dynamic control applications as it lacks precision.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a fine supercar that sports great looks, size, and great functions. The inside is solid, but the panels on the outside could be attached better. The playability is limited by the stiff steering and the lack of polarity switch. It is a great display model, but not much of a toy. Despite it's shortcomings, it's worth giving a try, if only to compare to the classic 8880 which is still the gold standard for a supercar.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
"Techman","2011-11-27T16:03:43.03Z","Awesome set has lot of cool features","<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>To start, I ordered this set a while back and was very eager to see the power functions in action. I knew already that this was going to have a ton of pieces before even buying it. When I got my hands on the set for the first time, I was blown away by the sheer size of the box. It weighed a lot too. The bags weren't numbered, which made building a little longer which was fine to me at least. I prefer enjoying my time watching a set unfold as I build it. The beginning of the model was a little bit tricky since that's where the gearbox was placed and a lot of gears were being meshed. <b>Be careful where you put the gears. </b>I almost put a gear in the wrong spot while building the gearbox. During the build, most of the assemblies weren't too repetitive, which was nice. The suspension and new CV joints were cool parts I haven't seen yet, but am glad to now own them. During the build, I was surprised to see just how large the length of the set was, close to 18 inches. There are also a lot of exterior panels which cover up the sides, top, back, and other portions of the car. I like the general aesthetics of the car. It looks appropriate for the type of muscle car it should be. The one thing I felt missing out of the set was dash steering. The steering wheel was there, but it didn't turn the wheels up front like some of the older sets like 8466 as an example. The main inner part of the car is mostly made up of beams to hold everything together. It is quite durable, except for the front which can be a bit flimsy when you leave the motor running too long after the hood has opened. Basically, it won't break apart in your hands if you hold it. The V8 engine is a nice touch to the set--it is sort of concealed by the hood and you can see the pistons moving in and out like a real car engine does. There are a total of four motorized features: the hood, rear spoiler, and both side gull doors which open at an angle. Because this car is so large, this set will take up some space when you are finished building it. But it is a great set to display and play with.&nbsp;To conclude, this set is an awesome set and I recommend it for all the red beams, panels and gears, etc.&nbsp;The price of around $120 is suitable since it comes with 1281 pieces. You will have hours of fun assembling the set and what it has to offer.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4

"Matty_Abe","2022-12-20T12:09:31.033Z","2022 Comparison Review","<p>In 2022 we have seen the release of the fourth 1:8 scale Technic set: the 42143 Ferrari Daytona SP3. A terrific set with incredible detail that is only realised during the build. Once the set is finished, it looks great, but it just sits there. The engine and extremely intricate&nbsp;gearbox cannot be easily &quot;worked&quot;</p>

<p>Compare that set with this 8070 Super Car...&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>hand of god steering (fairly well concealed)</li>
	<li>motorised hood/bonnet</li>
	<li>motorised left and right scissor doors (operated independently of each other)</li>
	<li>motorised spoiler (rear wing thing)</li>
	<li>visible working V8 engine (the same style pistons that have been used since Moses was a boy and also used in the 2022 Ferrari Daytona)</li>
</ul>

<p>As an AFOL, I don&#39;t regularly &quot;play&quot; with my sets, but I do like to give them a work-out from time to time (usually when I take them off the shelf to destroy LEGO&#39;s number one enemy... dust!).</p>

<p>The four 1:8 scale Technic cars are the pinnacle of Technic engineering and I adore them for that. However, when compared with this set, I just feel that the simple motorised functions make this set more of a true Technic set, and the 1:8 scale sets would be better suited to the theme&nbsp;<em>Creator Expert /&nbsp;Icons.</em></p>

<p>In my collection I also have the 8880 Super Car (from 1994!) which had a very simple gearbox and the very short-lived (in the real world) four wheel steering. I feel that it was this&nbsp;8880 Super Car that really kicked off the Technic Super Car love affair!</p>

<p>In conclusion, the 8070 Super Car is absolutely fantastic from a display and playability point of view. Both the 8070 and 8880 cars are both generic LEGO designed cars and not licenced sets. Later Technic sets are of course recreations of actual car brands/models&nbsp;and thus&nbsp;were/are much much much more expensive.</p>

<p>The 8070 Super Car is a bundle of Technic joy and a must-have for every Technic fan.&nbsp;</p>
