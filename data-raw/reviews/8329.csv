I have almost all of the original Pooh sets that my son enjoyed greatly when he was little and my girls now play with and love. The quality of the plastic used for the old Pooh sets is excellent and the pieces still look new after all these years and play. I worry that the new Pooh minifigs and non-brick pieces will not hold up as well. The new minifigs and honey pot look and feel cheaper than the original ones. This doesn't take away from any of the play value, my kids love this set. I just wonder if my grandkids will be able to play with this set.",FALSE,3,2,2,3,3
