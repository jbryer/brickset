"starwarsman52","2010-12-13T22:04:04.053Z","Great bounty hunter set","Overall, I really underestimated this set. I originally wasn't even going to get this set until I ran into some extra holiday money. The minifigures are fantastic. The assasin droid is like all the other ones. Sugi isn't amazing but shes a great addition to have either way. She has a nice doubled sided torso and a very detailed face. She comes with a normal blaster and one dagger knife. Embo is extremely detailed. Is face looks exactly like the clone wars version. He has a great double-sided torso and awesome printed legs. His weapon is a crossbow. His hat is okay. I wished they would have made a special, exclusive piece for that, but its still good. Aurra Sing is incredible. She also has a great double sided torso. She has 2 of the brand new mini blasters. Her hair piece is great and fits in her head quite well. They really detailed her exactly like the clone wars version. The ship is awesome. The green-yellow color scheme looks really nice. The engines rotate straight for flying mode and vertical for landing mode. The cockpit has very cool sticker detailing. Their are 2 compartments to the cockpit. The top section is the control section. The bottom section is the prison section where you can store 1 minifigure prisoner.<br><ul><li>Pros:</li><li>awesome minifigs</li><li>really nice ship</li><li>very good price</li><li>Cons:</li><li>tips on the ends of the engines move around sometimes</li><li>THATS IT!<br></li></ul>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

"captain_radda_radda","2011-01-02T21:49:46.023Z","INCREDIBLE SET!","<p>It had been a long time since i've seen a set this accurate to its tv counterpart. I just recently watched the episode <em>Bounty Hunters, </em>and saw quite literally no differences between the set actual gunship. The minifigures are fantastic and i especially like Embo. His hat is awesome and the printing is extremely accurate to the show. He even has printing on the back of his head! The crossbow is cool, but should be pure black rather than silver. Aurra Sing has been a fan favorite for years as well as my second favorite bounty hunter (Bossk for the win!) Her hairpiece is excellent, despite the fact that it is brown. This doesnt bother me though, since the attempted product came out even better than i expected. The biggest con is the exclusion of the long ranged rifle as seen in the comics and <em>Hostage Crisis.</em>&nbsp;I'm not surpirsed though, as the rifle is much longer than the standard clone rifle and has a strap across it. Mabye next time... Sugi is terrible. She looks more like an old lady than a Zabrak and only has four horns. The attempt at a pony tail was poor, and could have been replace with a new headpiece. The assasin droid is *sigh* just another assassin droid. This could have been a perfect attempt at including a commando droid, but I guess not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>New and incredible figures</p>
<p>Good pieces, nice colors, great design</p>
<p>Solid cockpit</p>
<p>Cool engines</p>
<p>HOLOCRON </p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>A tad expensive </p>
<p>minimal room for figures</p>
<p>Assassin droid</p>
<p>Engine flaps move way too much</p>
<p>Sugi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall:</p>
<p>A fantastic start to 2011, a truly incredible set. If your on the fence about this one, just buy it! It may be expensive, but the figs make up for it as well as its sheer beautiful appearance. So far, this is the best set i've seen in a LONG time. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"CapnRex101","2010-12-30T14:40:56.257Z","7930 - Bounty Hunter Assault Gunship","<p>This set is just sublime, pure and simple, the Minifigures and the Gunship itself are both excellent and have a high play value.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box art for this set shows the Gunship flying through space away from an orange planet with an asteroid belt, probably Geonosis. The laser cannons are firing and many explosions are taking place around the ship. There is also a smaller image of the ship in landing mode and a line up of the four Minifigures included in the set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions are perfect, like in every other set and I had no missing pieces, what more can you ask for? Unlike most Star Wars sets however the set has numbered bags, which makes the build much shorter and easier, but for those of you out there who enjoy the challenge of building your Lego sets, as I do, this can be a little frustrating.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are many interesting parts featured in this set including a couple of brand new moulds including Aurra Sing's hair and a dark grey flat piece with studs on either end. I particularly like however a new printed piece which has several buttons and some Aurebesh writing on it, in this set it acts as the lid for a box stored on top of the vehicle. I can see this piece being used a lot in future Star Wars sets. For those of you who dislike stickers, there are several in this set, but fortunately they are not too difficult to apply. Also there are many dark green parts in the set, which are quite rare, so could be useful in your own models.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Minifigures in this set are brilliant, we get four, an Elite&nbsp;Assassin Droid which is just the same as seen in the Assassin Droid Battle Pack, but it is still a nice inclusion to the set. There is also Sugi, who is quite a good figure, but lacks some detail and Embo who is a really interesting character and has been well recreated in Lego with some excellently detailed printing on his head, torso and legs. The highlight of the minifigures though, in my opinion is Aurra Sing, her printing is very accurate as is the new hair piece, which is not something that has been attempted before. She could be very useful as she has&nbsp;appeared&nbsp;in many recent Clone Wars episodes. On her legs she has printed holsters which look really good, equally as good as the new pistols which are included for her.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build took me about half an hour and was quite engaging. The construction of the mechanism to move the engines is very clever, and deceptively simple. There are many areas of the set which use some nice sloped pieces, and even better, they come in dark green! The method of connecting the cockpit to the main body of the gunship is quite interesting, and allows or easy&nbsp;separation, not that I can see why that would be&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The set overall is brilliant, very accurate to it's appearance (albeit short) in the season two episode of the Clone Wars 'Bounty Hunters'. I am very pleased that they included an Aurra Sing Minifigure even though she did not appear with this ship in the show, and therefore would not need to be in the set. The cockpit is spacious but has only one seat and a control panel.&nbsp;There&nbsp;is also a storage chamber or jail cell with bars and a hatch which closes over the bars. The main feature of the set however is the movable engines which move into landing position when the back of the ship is pulled, this movement also reveals the cargo box inside which there is a Jedi Holocron, despite what many people have said, I like this accessory, it at least resembles the Holocron seen in the television show, and is a welcome inclusion.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this set is amazing, in my opinion of all the Star Wars sets I have so far from 2011 (all but the T-6 Jedi Shuttle and the Battle of Naboo) the best equal to the Clone Trooper Battle Pack.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"starwarsgeek101_","2011-01-15T23:58:09.083Z","Better than expected","<p>This set is known for being the least-attractive set out there. You can argue, but if you compare the price of <strong>$50</strong> for a set that has only has <strong>389 pieces</strong>, you know that the other one would win. But the minifigures are very nice and the ship design is decent.</p>
<p><em>Minifigs</em></p>
<p>We can all say that the main reason for getting this set would be for <strong>Aurra Sing</strong>. She comes with a very unique headpiece and a detailed front/back torso and nice printed legs. Her weapons are two small blasters.</p>
<p>Two other minifigures in this set are <strong>Sugi</strong> and <strong>Embo</strong>. I personally dont know much of their backround but the Embo minifigure is very nice with a printed hat, a unique face with front/back printing, a unique front/back printed torso, and&nbsp;uniquely designed legs. Sugi lacks a hairpiece, which saddens me, and her legs are simply two shades of grey. Her head and torso are front/back printed however.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the unimportant <strong>useless assassin droid</strong>. I wouldnt really call this a minifigure since you could get 7 of them for $10 in a battle pack.</p>
<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Assault Ship</em></p>
<p>The ship itself is a nice size: <strong>not too big</strong>, about 11 inch. x 11 inch. The cockpit is nicely decorated to seat once person (Which i assume is Sugi). Underneath the cockpit is a compartment where <strong>you can barely fit a single minifigure</strong>. It looks like a brig for prisoners though by its jailbars, which is why it might be so small.</p>
<p>When ever you slide the large grey center panel of the ship, <strong>the wings rotate</strong>. When pushed foward, the wings go into flight mode: when&nbsp;you push them back,&nbsp;they go into landing mode. There is also a tiny chamber for a holocron of somesort.</p>
<p>Aside from the functions and size, <strong>there are stickers</strong> to this set. The pieces are pretty nice since you dont see these types of pieces in a dark green to often. It is pretty sturdy so it is pretty playable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So overall, would I recommend this set? Not at first, I'd buy a few other 2011 sets first, but this set is pretty nice even for $50.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"Squidtron","2012-01-08T00:12:38.637Z","Useful parts, well designed, cool minifigures, all-in-all, a good set!","I received this set from my brother for Christmas, and it was a great! <br><p><br></p><h4>Build</h4><br>The build was fun, though it made my thumbs sore. The fact that the internal structure of the cockpit was a technic framework was a pleasant surprise, after all, technic parts are useful in any theme (for building mechanical functions, esp. in Sc-Fi, not to mention Bionicle). The tail section was a rather simple build, but still, technic parts were pervasive in its construction. On this section, the technic parts perform an essential play feature, but I'll get to that in the appropriate section.<br><p><br></p><h4>Minifigures&nbsp;</h4><br>The minifigures on the set are brilliant. The four minifigures are Assassin Droid, Sugi, 
         

        <p class=""itemName"" title=""Aurra Sing"">Aurra Sing, and last, but certainly not least, Embo.<br></p>The Assassin Droid is useful for his parts, which make perfect greebles. The playability on him's not so great, because his hands cannot rotate and his legs do not move separately. But, hey, he can get of of playability by just lookin' awesome.<br>Sugi's a little dull compared to the other 'figs, but her parts (other than the head) make good civilian clothing, a feature not usually seen on space sets. The face I suppose would make a good alien face.<br>Aurra Sing's pieces are not as useful as Sugi's, but she certainly looks better in the set. The pants are useful in City and Space alike, I'm not quite sure what to use the torso for, but the head makes a pretty good alien head. The hair is about the most awesome LEGO hair I have ever seen. Instead of sticking on the stud on the minifigure's head, it fits<span style=""font-style: italic;""> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in </span></span>the hole in the center of the stud, giving it a creepy punk look. I have no idea what it will be useful for, but Aurra Sing's hair is the best part on her!<br>I save the best for last: Embo. His hat is pretty good looking, but the colors (Silver, mud-tan, brown, and dark grey)&nbsp; make it pretty difficult to use, especially since I have almost no parts in the same mud-tan color. His head is great, it is sandy green and somewhat buglike in appearance, apparently, he is wearing some kind of gold mask which conceals his mouth but leaves the rest of his face uncovered. The head is perfect for a bestial-alien look, which is a rare feature in minifig heads. The body also makes a good bestial-alien, but it can also serve as a space-guerrilla outfit. The legs are useful anywhere but city. They especially work well for a tribal-alien or sort of Prince-of-Persia feel. <br><p><br></p><h4>Playability</h4><br>This set has wonderful play features, especially if you have another set for the minifigures to run around on. The spaceship is heavy, and thus not very swooshable, but it is fun to land, have the minifigures climb out and attack something! The guns are not flick fire guns, but they are excellent for play, because they look good, and can be swiveled up and down to shoot a moving target. The most important feature is the landing mode, the tail of the ship can be pulled out about 2 studs and the engines tilt down so that the ship can balance on them. Also, the moving of the tail reveals a crate stored on top of the craft, this crate contains an item which looks like a transparent burger, but I have no idea what its actually supposed to be. The cockpit only has room for one minifigure, but if you feel like it you can stick the other 2 on the ship's wings. When the cockpit is opened, you can see the pilot as well as a gun rack on the roof. Their is endless fun, just so long as you have another set to play with.<br><p><br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p><br></p>The most fun part of this set comes when it is disassembled and in you LEGO drawers.The green parts are not specialized pieces, so they can be used on practically <span style=""font-style: italic;"">anything </span>dark green. Of course, the technic parts are immensely useful too, after all, the can increase the playability of any creation, or give it structural support. There are a couple nice greeble-parts, but not enough to be worth mentioning. The best parts are on the minifigs, which are useful in all themes. In sci-fi, by far the most useful is Embo, every single on of his pieces looks cool and is easy to use. Great pieces to create a primitive-technology space alien. The yellow is a nice touch, because it too comes in handy when building, though it is not a versatile as the dark green parts on this set. The windshield is very cool, I have not actually tried using it yet, but I think it could be very helpful, especially since I have no other windshields that are remotely like it.<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,3

"LegoMoose","2017-11-15T23:44:30.767Z","LegoMoose's Bounty Hunter Assault Gunship review","<p>Oh my, does writing this bring me back.</p>

<p>This set was just plain fun to build, and it was somewhat easy for an 8 year old to build. The parts are great, and the ship looks great as well.</p>

<p>This set has some pretty good play features. You pull back on the back section of the ship, and the two engine turbines transition from a horizontal position to a vertical landing position. This also reveals a hidden compartment in which a crate&nbsp;is snuggly put in! You can of course, open the top and insert a pilot as well as the two &#39;cheeks&#39;. This reveals a little prison cell under the pilot&#39;s seat. On the back of the cockpit, you can lift a hatch to show some bars that look into&nbsp;the inside of the prison cell.</p>

<p>There are some great minifigures. Especially the Embo. He has great printing and is probably my favorite bounty hunter from the Clone Wars TV Show. Aurra Sing as a special hairpiece, and the other two aren&#39;t very special.</p>
