So when I first saw this set I was very, very excited. When this set was first announced (by rumor) it had three new Jedi in the set (Quinlin Vos, Shaak Ti, and Saesee Tiin). So I was&nbsp;a little&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;in this set when the set&nbsp;actually&nbsp;had Obi-Wan, Anakin, Shaak Ti, and Saesee Tiin. However, this is one of the best sets that I have got in a long time. It is very well constructed and the new minifigs are very nice. It is a very nice building experience and well worth the money that you will spend on it. I don't like stickers, but I will not give it a bad rep because of it. There are 5 stickers for this set but they give it nice detail. The flick-fire missile system is poorly designed but does add some more&nbsp;playability&nbsp;to the set. If this set was to have Quinlin Vos it would be a 6 out of 5. That is the only downfall to this set. &nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"CapnRex101","2010-12-31T16:24:01.913Z","7931 - T-6 Jedi Shuttle","<p>This is another spectacular offering from this latest wave of Lego Star Wars, one of the best. The figures however put this set in a class of it's own.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art depicts the shuttle dodging laser blasts over a brown planet with swirling clouds, a blue planet is shown in the top right corner of the picture and the flick fire missiles are being fired from the shuttle.</p><p>The instructions are perfect and I had no missing pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are several interesting new parts in this set such as the cockpit glass which is printed very well and the large gears which are rarely found outside of Technic sets. But of course the highlights are the two headpieces for Shaak Ti and Saesee Tiin, which are both exquisitely sculpted and detailed.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Well perfection is that all that can be said. Saesee Tiin and Shaak Ti are two of the best figures to come out of this new wave of Lego Star Wars in my opinion, everything about them is brilliant. Strangely I like Saesee Tiin the best out of theses two minifigures, it's just the exquisite detail on his headpiece that wins me over. The Shaak Ti headpiece is also excellent with a slight rubbery feeling to it. Of course we also get Obi-Wan and Anakin which a nice for people who have just started collecting Lego Star Wars and do not have the figures, but for seasoned collectors they are becoming more than a little tedious, especially Anakin. All the figures in the set come with their respective coloured lightsabers of course which is obligatory. The lack of Quinlan Vos is not particularly important to me, while he would have been nice he is rumoured to be appearing in the Republic Frigate model with Eeth Koth and Commander Wolffe to be released in the summer of 2011.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This set is reasonably easy to build, but has some Technic pieces which younger children may find difficult to put together. It took me roughly forty-five minutes start to finish and was quite an exciting build.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The shuttle is really well done. It looks like a difficult item to design and the designers have done a good job on this. The feature of the swivelling wing section is very well thought out as are the flick fire missiles and the cockpit, which at a squeeze takes three Minifigures, not bad for such a small space. The Minifigures as I have constantly said are the outstanding elements of the set however, and somewhat steal the show.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As is evident now, this set is frankly amazing, the shuttle itself is very good, but the Minifigures are the highlight, as with many of the recent sets.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Carl","2011-01-09T16:26:10.703Z","T-6 Jedi Shuttle","Everything about this set is FANTASTIC. This set is one of the best Star Wars sets LEGO has ever made and I was incredibly happy to get this as a birthday present today (10th January)<div><br></div><h4>Minifigures</h4><div><br></div><div>As I said before, everything about this set is FANTASTIC. Well I was lying. The minifigures are BETTER than FANTASTIC! People have complaining about Quinlan Vos not being in this set despite being featured in this set in preliminary images, but this doesn't really bother me, as he is going to be in the 7964 Republic Frigate coming out later this year. Now onto the actual minifigures.</div><div><br></div><div>- <b>Anakin Skywalker </b>is the same old lame old in my opinion. He has been in more sets than there are pieces in the T-6 (gross exaggeration) but I suppose he was in the shuttle with Obi-Wan in the Season 2 Clone Wars episode 'Bounty Hunters'. Although I would have preferred Quinlan Vos, he will be coming later in the year and I don't have to put Anakin in the Shuttle.</div><div><br></div><div>- <b>Obi-Wan Kenobi</b> is a pretty good minifigure. He is a very good likeness to his Clone Wars self and is a welcome addition to the set, seeing as I didn't get the other two sets he was in, so this is my first Clone Wars Obi-Wan Kenobi.</div><div><br></div><div>- <b>Saesee Tiin</b> is an AWESOME minifigure! LEGO has made the Iktotchi Jedi Master perfectly in my opinion. His horns and tough-skin forehead are fantastic and he is my third favourite Jedi that I have, behind Aayla Secura (2nd) and the T-6's very own Shaak Ti. Easily one of the best minifigures ever made.</div><div><br></div><div>- <b>Shaak Ti</b> is amazing. In fact, to call her amazing is a gross injustice. This Togruta beauty is my favourite Jedi minifigure and definitely one of the best minifigures ever made by LEGO. Her lekku (head-tails) are very good and the only disadvantage to her is that while wearing her cape it is very hard to sit her in the cockpit of the T-6.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h4>T-6 Jedi Shuttle</h4><div><br></div><div>The build of the Jedi Shuttle is very sturdy and LEGO have done a very good job at making it big whilst only using 389 pieces. Seriously, it's a LOT bigger than I thought it would be. The body of the shuttle has a very interesting build and comes together with the other components of the shuttle brilliantly. The flick-fire missiles that come out from the engine area when you push the outside two engines work a lot better than most flick-fire missiles and go quite far. The landing gear is simple, consisting of only three pieces, but does it's job very well. I suppose it has to though, as the shuttle can't land flat without it!</div><p><br></p><p>The wings are genius. In my opinion they are just right for the shuttle itself and although they may be lacking the width of the actual shuttle that is featured in the Clone Wars episodes, I don't mind one bit. They turn great and the big gear in the middle of the craft slows down the rotation a bit to make sure the wings don't spin like crazy. The design on the top is very appealing, however perhaps my biggest fault with the set is the unattractive underside. I would have much preferred it if there were studs on both sides, but it's up to LEGO.</p><div><br></div><div>The cockpit has been probably the most controversial part of the shuttle on other web sites that have reviewed this set, with most people saying that the interior is ugly and that LEGO could have done a better job. I do not agree. The cockpit can fit two minifigs (Shaak Ti can only fit if you put her in the front seat with the bottom of her cape rolled up) and three at a squeeze. The exterior has been sculpted very well and the windshield comes of easily in order to remove the minifigures from the cockpit. The cockpit can also detach easily from the main body of the shuttle as an escape pod and I think that this is a neat extra feature to a set already filled to the brim with playability features. Although the interior is a little unattractive WITHOUT minifigures seated inside, when there are minifigures in it you don't notice it at all.</div><div><br></div><h4>Price</h4><div><br></div><div>Seeing as I got this set as a birthday present, I can't really judge the price.</div><h4><br></h4><h4>Overall</h4><div><br></div><div>Overall this an absolutely magnificent set, and I am&nbsp;exceedingly happy with it, especially as I got it for free for my birthday.&nbsp;The minifigures are amazing and the whole ship is an architectural triumph. I would definitely recommend purchasing this set, no matter what the store price is as it is truly brilliant.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Brickman193","2011-01-18T01:24:24.293Z","2 Hitch-hiking Jedi","Well, today I bought this set from the local Toyworld. It was $90 AUS, on sale from the RRP of $100, so I bought it. Let me just say, the set is amazing.<div><br></div><div><b>Pros:</b></div><div><ul><li>The minifigures are all amazing -for a set named Jedi Shuttle, it doesn't disappoint! The real attractions here are Saesee Tiin and Shaak Ti, both well detailed with great torsos and headpieces. Obi-Wan is here again, quite rare in the CW theme and always a welcome minifig. The last is Anakin, which seems to irk a lot of people, but I did not already own him, so I didn't mind. Still, for most collectors, the set offers some top notch minifigs. 5/5</li><li>The ship is amazing, both in aesthetics and design. The colour scheme is a bold red and white, with splashings of grey and blue; its colour helps it stand out on the shelf or display table. The design is easy enough, with each wing, the body and the cockpit being a separate bag. No part of the building process was too repetitive. 5/5</li><li>The ship has a great ""SWOOSH"" factor to it. The gears that move the wings around the body are well designed, and the complete vehicle has a nice sturdiness to it. It has a lot of heft, too, for so few parts.</li></ul><div><b>Cons:</b></div></div><div><ul><li>Not a damn thing, in my opinion. Some people might find an issue with its pricing, but for the amazing minifigures and a cool looking ship, it's worth the full price!</li></ul></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Berrus_Brickus","2011-02-11T15:50:55.31Z","Crash-landing in space?","<p>I&nbsp;purchased this set from&nbsp;<strong>Wal*Mart</strong> for about $60, not even worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am debating whether or not this set was even&nbsp;designed, or just thrown together.&nbsp; And at $60 (for 389 pieces?), I would expect it to be.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Want to hear about the parts <em>Brickset?</em> Okay, well they are mostly, very large and not very useful except for things along the lines of other <strong>STAR WARS</strong> ships.&nbsp; I understand that the large pieces&nbsp;are probably for structure, well, it doesn't stay together all that well.&nbsp; See <strong>The completed model. </strong>Most of the parts are either (classic) red, white, or light blay, with a little tan, black, and trans. light blue mixed in.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set includes 389 LEGO elements, the same as the <em>Bounty Hunter Gunship, </em>which I believe is about $10 less.&nbsp; I don't own it, but I would have to say go for that as this has structure problems.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no printed parts in this set except for a little Jedi starfighter control panel (haven't seen one of those in a few years) and the windshield.&nbsp; So everything else is a sticker.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>We get four minifigures here, Obi Wan Kenobi (3rd set to include him), Shakk Ti (1st), Saesse Tiin (1st), and another Anakin Skywalker (about 100th).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these figures are new to me, even Anakin, though I did have an Ep. III Obi-Wan.</p>
<p>I often tend to go on about the figures, but I am writing&nbsp;this in a hurry, so this will be brief:&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Shaak Ti:</strong> Dark brown legs, Dark brown torso w/ a dark brown cloak and part of her red chest showing, Dark brown cape/cloak (I liked the feel of these back in 2001 more), an exclusive head with little detailing (thank you, the late 2011 Jedi are mostly hideous), and an exclusive head-gear piece showing her extended foarhead. </p>
<p><strong>Saesse Tiin: </strong>Dark brown legs, Dark brown torso with white arms &amp; black hands, exclusive face with nice golden eyes (CW version actually looks good here!) and an exclusive head piece showing the horns.</p>
<p><strong>Obi-Wan Kenobi: </strong>White legs with tan hips, same tan torso with white arms, face with large blue eyes and burnt orange beard, exclusive burnt orange hairpiece</p>
<p><strong>Anakin Skywalker: </strong>Black legs, black torso (very similar to Obi-Wan's, different belt though) with brown arms, exclusive face with large blue eyes and a scar from Ventress, and an exclusive ""Clutch Powers"" hairpiece in brown.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>A fairly easy build.&nbsp; Took me about 50 min. give or take a few.&nbsp; And that includes about two backtracks, and sombody (not me) spilling all four bags out at once.&nbsp; The only part that I actually enjoyed building was the hull (bag 1).&nbsp; The wings (bags 2 &amp; 3) were repetative and confusing.&nbsp; Bag 4 was the cockpit, and the colors are so mismatched that it wasn't even fun!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Very, very fragile.&nbsp; Hardly any playability at all because it is always falling apart, there is no support on the bottom of the wings, <em>so&nbsp;those&nbsp;are always fun to build and rebuild :(&nbsp; </em>When the cockpit is removed, the pins are so strong that it usually takes part of the hull with it.&nbsp; On the note of the cockpit, the rotating feature works, but it is pretty hard to turn the wings because you need one hand on the cockpit or hull, and another to turn the wing, which moves very slowly and requires some force, won't be too easy for children.&nbsp; And again about the cockpit, it does look&nbsp; good from the out side, <em>but, </em>on the inside all of the colors are mismatched, and the two minifigures (yet this set comes with four) can hardly see out side of the window, and they hardly stay in their seats.&nbsp; Shaak Ti can't even ride the shuttle because of her cloak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shuttle has a total of <em>two </em>flick-fire missles. <em>""It's more than a match for the Bounty Hunters!""</em> Not really, two missles aren't that impressive and they can't even shoot out when the wings are left-right.&nbsp; Note: The missles have a button to push so that they are fired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the wings.&nbsp; The top section looks nice, but on the bottom they are gray and have white and red plates at various angles.&nbsp; It would be nice if they included some more of those large white plates so that it would at least look as if they tried. The wings are also uneven, when angled up-down, they are either slightly more to the left, or to the right as when the studs on the wings are upwords, they are lifted slightly higher than they should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And lastly, the thing is pretty heavy, so it would have not ""swooshability"" with young kids, especially when the wings are up-down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>I would have to say, get the <em>Bounty-Hunter Gunship</em>, it has the same amount of pieces, and is $10 lower.&nbsp; Don't even purchase this set for the figures, get them of off Bricklink.</p>",TRUE,2,2,4,2,3

"David1971","2011-08-20T15:58:47.567Z","Very stylish and delightful ... showing the power of the Lucasfilm + Lego collaboration","<p>I was very happy building this. It's so stylish and very impressive, and very satisfying.</p><p>The design, I couldn't help thinking, was rather a striking achievement, and it's one of those things where the work of the Star Wars designers plus the work of the Lego designers comes together beautifully - so it's a really powerful testament to the Lucasfilm + Lego collaboration. Because the Lego company on its own doesn't, frankly, produce such beautiful designs. They do great stuff, but this design is exceptional. For example, the use of colours is very particular - mostly white but with the stylish red stripes cutting across, and some light grey. The colours are not garish, and the design is attractive but also functional - it makes sense as a spaceship that people would actually fly in.</p><p>But - to hand credit back to the Lego designers - this is executed in Lego extremely well as well, with some great SNOT (Studs Not On Top) work around the engines, and many other very nicely done features. I do love those engines, with the transparent light blue coming out of them; they look fantastic.</p><p>The four minifigs are all very nice with great attention to detail. The ship is only able to actually seat two of them, which is the kind of thing that I have found annoying in other sets, but I can forgive in this one.<br></p><p>The set does use some stickers, which I don't usually like at all, but these are ok. Generally I leave them off, but I applied the wing stickers here and they do look good. You have to be super-careful to put them on straight, of course.<br></p><p>Overall this is an extremely nice spaceship, and a very fine Lego set. Well done, everybody.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

By the way, the missiles do not fire very far.&nbsp; And that is all for the ""playability"" features other than ""swooshability.""&nbsp; On the other hand, my child drop it, and the wings broke.&nbsp; In summary, it is not very child-friendly.&nbsp; There is nothing really to do.&nbsp; The playability is horrible.&nbsp; <br><h4>The Value.&nbsp; (1/5)</h4><p>The price of $60 with 389 pieces is extremely bad value (15 cents per piece).&nbsp; Even for what get, it is still bad value. <br></p><h4>The Summary.&nbsp; <br></h4><p>Overall, this set is horrible.&nbsp; It has play features that do not work very well such as the rotating wings, the fire-flick missiles, the cockpit storage, and sturdiness of the ship.&nbsp; It does not do anything.&nbsp; However, the shuttle looks great; the minifigures are good; the build was enjoyable.&nbsp; And the parts are excellent.&nbsp; However, the value is terrible.&nbsp; If I had to choose between this and 8096 Emperor Palpatine's Shuttle, I would chose Palpatine's Shuttle.&nbsp; It has better minifigures, more storage, and more pieces.&nbsp; (*Note:&nbsp; I compared this to 8096 Emperor Palpatine's Shuttle because both are current available shuttles.*)&nbsp; The set is truly a rip-off.&nbsp; I recommend to not buy this set.&nbsp; Rating:&nbsp; 17/25 (68% out of 100%)<br></p><br>",TRUE,2,5,5,1,1

The overall construction is modular, with the cockpit, engine and turntable-mounted wings assembled separately and slotted together to form the final model.

The T-6 shuttle's wing section rotates brilliantly and smoothly on an ingenious turntable, and has no notable flaws. Just make sure you have the landing gear folded up when you rotate the wing... Also, a weirdly excellent flick-fire missile mechanism is included in the engine section. You hit the engine nozzles to eject the missiles, which fire quite far!

Firstly there is a lot of unfinished detail on the reverse of the wing. Secondly I think that the&nbsp;new&nbsp;minifigures are good and this is only the third time obi-wan has been in a set. But I think they could swap anakin for maybe adi gallia or another interesting jedi. But on the playability side of things it was a very good set. Maybe the cockpit could have been a little bigger to fit all the minifigs and they need somewhere to store their lightsabers. Overall I would give it an 8/10 just because of anakin and the unfinished detail. I think the price is also a letdown. I mean the bounty hunter gunship has the same amount of pieces but is £10 cheaper. I suppose considering that there are some rare peices and because of the minifigs it is an alright price. I think it could maybe drop £10 to the same as the bounty hunter ship.",FALSE,4,4,3,5,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-10-05T09:56:39.097Z","LEGO Star Wars - T-6 Jedi Shuttle Review","<div class=""description""><p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 389 pieces and it is 60 USD. That means that the price per 
piece ratio is 15 cents per piece which is a really good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs are very cool. We get Anakin Skywalker who has the basic Clone Wars design. We also get the Clone Wars version of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He isn't a new figure as well. The two figures which are more exciting are Saesee Tiin and Shaak Ti. Saesee Tiin has a nice head design and he is the only minifig in this set which has printings on the back of the torso and a green lightsaber. Shaak Ti is my favourite figure of this set, because she looks so detailed. She is the only figure which has a cape. What's also very cool about this set is that this is the only set which includes this character in so far.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is a lot of fun and we also get a few stickers to put on.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/7931-1.jpg[/img]</span><br></span></p><p><br></p><p>The
 set looks very cool and it's fun to play with. However, it's a little bit tricky to open the cockpit and we also can't fit all 4 figures in the cockpit. Another downfall we get here is that there's no room for the lightsabers and Shaak Ti's cape. What I like about this set is how the wings are going to move around the cockpit. On the bottom we get a nice little landing-gear which can be adjusted. I also love the details on the engines and you can push the engines to shoot the <span></span><span>flick-missiles.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"fatpretzel","2012-07-04T18:17:20.487Z","Make sure you get my good side!","<p>This ship is well designed and&nbsp;surprisingly better on a shelf than I thought it would. The designers did an excellent job throughout the set. The inclusion of Saesee Tiin and Shaak Ti are fabulous additions to the mini-figure lineup.</p><p><br></p><h4>Box</h4><p>This box is pretty large for containing under 400 pieces. The front of the box shows off the two best features of this set in the lower corners. On the bottom left is an inset of the wing rotation in progress and the lower right shows off the two new mini-figures.</p><p><br></p><h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are 8""x11"" and well printed. I saw no typos or misprints in my set. There was only one instance of a sub-assembly taking more than a full page, but that instance showed the instance was repeated twice at the beginning and the completion of the assembly.</p><p><br></p><h4>Mini-Figures</h4><p></p><ul><li><b>Anakin Skywalker</b>&nbsp;- He seems to be in every Clone Wars set right now and this one is no exception. He looks good from the front but absolutely blank from behind.</li><li><b>Obi-Wan Kenobi</b>&nbsp;- Obi-Wan is also lacking detail from behind. I am also not a big fan of his ""Angry Eyes"" expression.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Saesee Tiin</b>&nbsp;- He looks great fro his first appearance. His ""hair"" blends in well with his head and includes lots of detail.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Shaak Ti - </b>This is the best mini-figure in the set. Her montrals are&nbsp;exquisitely detailed and blend seamlessly into her head. She is also the only figure in the set with a cloak.&nbsp;</li><li><br></li></ul><h4>Assembly</h4><p>This set went together very quickly. I put the whole thing together in less than forty minutes. Most of the assembly is in the vertical direction, but there are some nice horizontal build elements in the cockpit and around the engines. This makes for some nice trim around the engine housing. The fuselage also has two flick-fire missiles activated by hitting the outboard exhausts. The landing gear seems to be tacked on after the designer realized the set wouldn't sit right without it. The rotating wings look great from the top and right side, but are an afterthought on the left. I was disappointed by the lack of detail on the reverse side of the wing. The cockpit uses a lot of the same design elements as Emperor Palpatine's Shuttle. The set is only designed for two mini-figures which leaves two guys to hitch a ride with someone else.</p><p><br></p><h4>Playability</h4><p>The lack of room for two of the mini-figures is a big minus. This set also doesn't sit easily in your hand so I would say that younger users will have difficulty playing with it. Every Star Wars LEGO set seem to have flick-fire missiles now and this one is no exception. The wing rotation works well, but does require some juggling to shift from landing to flight mode.</p><p><br></p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>This set looks good, ""from a certain point of view."" The wing makes up the majority of the surface of this set, but looks like the designer only worried about one side. LEGO is trying to include a lot more mini-figures with sets. I think they overreached on this one by including two more mini-figures than could fit in the set. Without something for those other guys to do, they are just going to feel lonely. This set tries to appeal to collectors and kids at the same time and pulls both of them off so-so.</p><p></p>",TRUE,3,5,5,3,2
