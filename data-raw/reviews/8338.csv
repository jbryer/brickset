<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>As per all architecture sets the brief history of the real life building is interesting, but the info is limited compared to what can be found from google. Instructions are nothing special.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>Tan.. tan.. actually I like this set and the empire state building because of the tan.. but other than a few 1x3 tiles it's just basic bricks, plates, tiles. Of course it could be argued that this is purest lego at it's best. Basic parts, representing something real. In this sense the lack of special parts is great.<br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>Erm.. well.. I suppose Gorilla Suit guy might stomp around the place..<br>
<h4>The build</h4>Quick, easy.. plate..plate..plate, brick, brick, plate..snot. Done.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4>Never been there.. I like the architecture sets, have aquired parts for and built all of them, this is my personal 2nd favorate after the Empire State Building.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4>Expensive as a set, cheaper from bricklink.. If you're a collecter, like architecture, live in the Rockefeller center, or are a rampaging minifig bent on destruction I'm sure this is the set for you.. if you're looking for playability.. go with anything the bricklink random search throws at you :-)<br>",TRUE,4,1,3,1,2
