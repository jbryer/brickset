(Picture above for reference). Both their heads and bodies were the same size. This used to amuse me very much last time as I thought that it was crazy to put these people beside my regular size minifigs. This set also came with windows, wheels, vehicle chassis, car windshields, propellers, and a giant load of regular bricks.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
