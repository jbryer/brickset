"sparticusjoe","2018-03-30T19:25:11.7Z","A very long, detailed review about a very, very obscure Lego set.","<p>Once upon a time a twentysomething guy with the online alias &quot;sparticusjoe&quot; embarked on a magical quest to re-build and review a whole bunch of Lego sets he found in his parent&#39;s attic, virtually all of which were from the 1996-2000 Town Jr. line. To his surprise, after much building, looking up instructions long lost, and research, it turns out that preteen sparticusjoe had every single Town Jr. set with only four exceptions. One was the &quot;Command Post Central&quot; massive police station set that I probably didn&#39;t have just because of the massive quantity of other police sets I had at the time. One was a very obscure and hard to find set consisting of nothing but road signs. One was the 6435 &quot;Coast Guard HQ&quot; set, a set so obscure I&#39;ve still yet to find it for sale in the states for less than several hundred dollars. The fourth and final one was this set.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m a natural born completionist when it comes to any hobby I have. Whether it be collecting old movies, model trains, albums by bands I like, my collection of ancient military memorabilia, my collection of very old military revolvers, or any of the other various weird interests I have, if I don&#39;t have every variant of something there&#39;s a nagging feeling I get that something&#39;s wrong. It feels nice to have every version of something you like so you can compare every one of it to every other one of it to people like me.</p>

<p>Well, it was tax return time this year and Bricklink had exactly one copy of this set for sale for around a hundred bucks, brand new, so I figured I&#39;d get that much closer to that desired 100 percent completion and spring for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to try to be even more thorough than normal in this review because there is just about zero information on this set out there. Of the four I don&#39;t have, this is the one I was most wanting just because of how obscure it is. The fact that I seem to have gotten the last remaining copy of this set on earth outside of a lone one for about 400 buckaroos on ebay means it&#39;s doubtful very many people know anything about this set, and the lack of even a single review of it on the entire internet means I doubt many people ever will. So I&#39;m going to try to change that.</p>

<p>Lego set 2234, strangely titled &quot;Police Chase&quot;, is an extremely strange set. Apparently it was released as a promotional set for a store chain I&#39;ve never once heard of, as I live in the Big Bend region of Texas and not Germany. I have no idea if it was ever available anywhere else, though considering how hard it is to find any information about this set I highly doubt it.</p>

<p>As per usual with my reviews, if TLC gave it a separate instruction sheet I&#39;m going to review it separately, and I&#39;ll finish up by summing up my thoughts on the five categories you rate it on.</p>

<p><strong>The Packaging: </strong>On all the other sets I have and have reviewed I haven&#39;t included this as I so rarely kept the boxes and bags when I was a kid. This one I got new as a grown-up so I can comment on it. The box this thing comes in is absolutely huge. For having only 146 pieces, this thing&#39;s package tricks you into thinking it&#39;s <em>way</em> bigger than it actually is. The pair of road-baseplates you get with the set come in a plastic tray that doesn&#39;t really fit very well in the inner box, and each of the components of the set come in very, very large, very eye-catching baggies of their own. For how tiny the components of this set are, the baggies are probably four times the size they need to be, particularly on the police car&#39;s baggie which is the same size as the building included&#39;s baggie despite the car being a fifth the size of the police station.</p>

<p>The standard assortment of alternate models are included on the back of the box, most of which are uninspiring to say the least. It&#39;s basically just three variants of &quot;make a slightly different looking car out of the cars the instructions give you&quot;. I do plan on uploading a photo of the back of the box somewhere here soon because there does not appear to be a single picture of it on the whole internet.</p>

<p>Each baggie has a separate instruction sheet for each individual part of the set, in standard Town Jr. fashion. This is, as always, entirely unnecessary and just adds to the ease of losing the tiny instruction sheets instead of just having one nice large bookle.</p>

<p><strong>The Turbo Car: </strong>First we have a red civilian vehicle with &quot;TURBO&quot; written huge on the sides of it. This is pretty bog standard Town Jr. bad car design, it&#39;s mostly a prefabricated chassis, there isn&#39;t any roof (for any of the cars in this set, actually), there&#39;s no seat for the driver, and it only barely resembles a vehicle. Of note is that, a theme we&#39;ll be touching on a surprisingly huge amount in this review, this vehicle is <strong>EXACTLY</strong> like the civilian car included with set 6333, Race and Chase, except it&#39;s color-swapped. This is a shockingly common theme in this set: literally every single component of this set is identical to a component in another set, but pallate-swapped. I can only imagine the reason for this is that this was a barely-released and barely-distributed promotional set and TLC didn&#39;t really feel like having its A-team of designers (or any designers at all) working too hard on building this thing. Of note, however, is that the pair of red bricks with &quot;TURBO&quot; printed on the sides of this car are exclusive to this set, two of the actually several that are 2234 exclusives. The fact that a set this rare even has exclusives is sort of surprising but there it is.</p>

<p><strong>The Police Car: </strong>Guess what, friends? It&#39;s the exact same police car as in 6333, except with a green windshield instead of a blue one. Other than that? Same car. Exact same. No difference. Much like in that set, there isn&#39;t a seat for the officer to sit in, there is basically no detailing on it, the chassis is prefabricated, and there isn&#39;t even a back to his vehicle. Classic 90&#39;s bad car design right here. The printed hood piece is sort of cool, but if you have the extremely common #6333, you already have it. Lego&#39;s obsession with making vehicles with rollbars in the back and no roof and no chairs continues with full force in:</p>

<p><strong>The &quot;V8&quot; Car: </strong>Why if it isn&#39;t the exact same car as in #6327, Turbo Champs, except pallette swapped! This time instead of being white and saying TURBO, it&#39;s blue and says &quot;V8 POWER&quot;, exactly like the civilian car in #6333 did, so TLC could even re-use that piece from that set. Going down the list... Pointless rollbar? Check. Roof? Of course not. Chair for the driver? What are you, crazy? Weird, pointless pair of antennaes where they don&#39;t belong? You got it. That&#39;s right friends, it&#39;s a vehicle from the 96-2000 era, it takes eight seconds to build, and everything&#39;s pre-fabricated. What do you expect.</p>

<p><strong>The Trailer: </strong>Why this microscopic part of the set has its own instruction sheet I don&#39;t know, but this is by far the easiest part to review in the whole set. It&#39;s... the exact same trailer as in #6327 Turbo Champs (which is in and of itself the exact same trailer as in Super Cycle Center). No differences, no pallette swaps, just verbatim the same trailer as in those two sets except the tile that said &quot;TURBO&quot; now is just a blue tile. That&#39;s it. TLC put this exact same trailer in three sets in the era, and in all three felt it deserved its own instruction sheet. Huh.</p>

<p><strong>The Trike: </strong>It&#39;s a Lego Tricycle, alright. These things were everywhere back in the day and nobody liked them. The old two-wheeled motorcycles were far, far cooler and more desirable even at the time, but TLC tried forcing these things down everyone&#39;s throats until they were quietly phased out in around 2002-ish. It&#39;s exactly like every other one you&#39;ve ever seen, but this one is red. Two lights, a rollbar for absolutely no reason, the body is totally prefabricated, no thrills, no frills, just a Lego tricycle. Nothing to see here folks.</p>

<p><strong>The Baseplates</strong>: Yes, this actually does have its own instruction sheet, just in case you can&#39;t figure out how to put three signs and three trees and two fences down on a pair of&nbsp; baseplates. These are always nice to have more of (my current total is six!), and they are as cool in this set as they are in Super Rescue Complex and Roadblock Runners. The accessories you get are three trees, of which one is large and the other two are the smaller christmas tree type ones, three signs (a STOP sign, a crosswalk sign, and one that&#39;s a triangle with an X on it that I&#39;ve never seen having been driving on American roads my whole life). The signs are interestingly the old-style 2x1 base signs that are absurdly flimsy and possible to break by simply removing them from a brick too many times (ask me how I know that) instead of the 2x2 base ones that were far more common by the time this set came out.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a neat little gate thing you can put on to block one side of the road... and it&#39;s exactly like the one in 6330 Cargo Center! That&#39;s right, even this one tiny little detail is ripped off from another set of the era. The lone other baseplate accessory you get are a pair of the massive, weirdly out of scale to minifigures yellow Fabuland-style fence bricks. I have no idea why these were included and they&#39;re so massive (being about 2/3rds the height of a minifigure while only having two horizontal planks on the fence) that they stick out like a sore thumb. These bricks aren&#39;t exactly common however so it&#39;s neat to see some for that reason alone.</p>

<p><strong>The Police Station</strong>: Man, Lego&#39;s made a lot of police stations. This is one of three that came out at the time, one being Command Post Central, one being the thing I dubbed a &quot;Police Shed&quot; in set 6464, and now this one. This one is... Probably the single strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in a Lego set. So for this police station, TLC took the Truck Stop Cafe from set 6329, and just re-skinned it to be a police station. The problem is construction-wise, it&#39;s <strong>EXACTLY THE SAME</strong> as the truck stop cafe is. This leads to the only police station ever built to have a <em>drive thru serving window</em> on the side of it, complete with a canopy. Seriously, this thing looks like one of those businesses where a business buys the building of a defunct restaurant, so that while the sign says it&#39;s a payday loan business the shape of the building says it&#39;s a Pizza Hut. Only this time it&#39;s the Lego Police force doing that to the poor Truck Stop restaurant.</p>

<p>The &quot;burgers/fries/pizza&quot; sign out front has been replaced with an identical brick with a badge on it. The &quot;TRUCK STOP&quot; sign on top has been replaced with an identical brick with the word &quot;POLICE&quot; on it. The yellow flags are now white. On the inside where there was previously a pizza, pair of mugs, and spigot for drinks on a serving counter, there&#39;s now... still the serving counter, but now just a single mug and a completely pointless white lever.</p>

<p>But still, by far the most hilarious part of this whole ordeal is the drive thru window. It&#39;s still there. The canopy is just plain white instead of white with green stripes, but it&#39;s still a drive thru window. At a police station. With a counter for food. There&#39;s plagiarizing your own work for a forgotten promotional set, and then there&#39;s building a police station with a drive-thru window. I&#39;m sort of glad I got this set just for how strange that inclusion is.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures: </strong>Normally I don&#39;t review this separately but considering I&#39;m one of maybe four people to own this set and almost definitely the only one to actually build it in 2018, I figured I&#39;d list them for anyone who may care someday after finding out they too have every Town Jr. set but this one:</p>

<p>There&#39;s an Octan Oil guy with a motorcycle helmet, a male policeman that&#39;s as generic as they come, a &quot;green zipper jacket&quot; guy that if you collect 90&#39;s Lego you have sixty five copies of this guy already (he sure gets around!), a &quot;leather jacket with red undershirt&quot; guy that&#39;s only slightly less common than his green friend, and the lone standout is a female police officer, something TLC didn&#39;t make too many of so that&#39;s something.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>Man, it&#39;s 1998, what do you want? It&#39;s like building Turbo Champs, Race &amp; Chase, and the Truck Stop Cafe, but with different colors. Other than the color swap it&#39;s the exact same sets as those. None of those three had good building experiences and this doesn&#39;t either. It&#39;s Town Jr., everything&#39;s mostly built for you. It is what it is.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>NOW we&#39;re talking. If this set was to get recommended for anything it&#39;s the parts. There are a <em>shocking</em> amount of exclusive parts for a set that was barely made, barely released, and all but forgotten about. The &quot;POLICE&quot; panel brick on top of the station? Exclusive. The police badge panel? Extremely rare. The police badge window in front of the station? This and the extremely expensive Command Post Central are the only places you&#39;re getting those. Other exclusives and highly rare pieces are: Fabuland fences (for some reason), trees (can never have too many), the lovely road baseplates, the &quot;TURBO&quot; red brick which was never seen outside of this set, and the old-timey extremely delicate 2x1 based road signs of which you get three.</p>

<p>My only complaint in the parts category is that there aren&#39;t enough of them. Seriously, this set should be about twice its size considering how big the packaging are. However, for how uninspired and low-quality the rest of this set is what&#39;s here really isn&#39;t bad.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>This is the only Lego set I&#39;ve reviewed so far that I didn&#39;t have as a kid, so I have no fond memories of playing with it as a youngster, nor do I imagine I knew it even existed. However, if you were a kid I can imagine you&#39;d have some fun with this. It&#39;s got a ton of vehicles, uninspired though they may be, most of which are perfectly playable for a young imagination. You can act out police chases till the cows come home and I&#39;m sure many, apparently primarily German, kids did.</p>

<p>Displayability is another matter. You&#39;d better believe I&#39;m going to display this thing, it cost a hundred dollars and it probably the rarest Lego set I own, but it&#39;s not particularly attractive or anything and the biggest standout feature, the police station, looks quite frankly ridiculous.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>If it&#39;s not obvious by now, you really shouldn&#39;t buy this set. You probably can&#39;t buy this set for under 500 dollars, which believe me it isn&#39;t worth. You *might* someday manage to score the thing for 100 dollars like I did, which... Isn&#39;t worth it in a vaccuum, but if you&#39;re a completionist of weird things and enjoy oddities as much as I do you&#39;ll probably get some enjoyment from, but putting that Benjamin towards your power bill (or a Lego Train set) is probably a better investment.</p>

<p>On its own merits this is a fifteen dollar set at best. However, considering it wound up being such an obscure part of such an obscure theme as Town Jr. during a fairly obscure part of Lego history, it does have some worth. You can expand your town with two road baseplates and get some civilian vehicles that are merely uninspired, not necessarily bad, and you get the single goofiest looking building I&#39;ve ever seen in a relatively modern Lego set out of the deal.</p>

<p>That said, odds are you won&#39;t be able to find it because I was just barely able to find it, and to be completely, 100 percent honest, that&#39;s a-okay. Some things are obscure for a reason.</p>
