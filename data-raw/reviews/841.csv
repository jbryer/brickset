"SafePit","2009-05-25T22:06:10.403Z","Great Beginner Book","These LEGO idea books were a great idea and helped spawn other ideas.  I built most of the models in this book as a child and later as an adult using POV-Ray.  The nice thing about this book is if you have the basic sets, you can build just about every model in the book.  Some items are a bit hard to find today (fences and old style doors), but I'm sure you can work around that with some basic intuition.  Great for younger kids -- especially the smaller plane and animal models.  For more advanced builders with older sets, check out the LEGOLAND Idea Book from 1980.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It was quite a bit different that my&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/ISBN0756686067-1/The-LEGO-Ideas-Book"">ISBN0756686067-1</a>&nbsp;LEGO Ideas book and I was really impressed by how good it was considering the age.</p>

<p>This book was released&nbsp;one year before LEGO got their patent granted for their minifigure&nbsp;design and all we had were maxifigures&nbsp;(one is shown on the cover of the book)&nbsp;and the predecessors&nbsp;to the minifigure, the LEGO-Land figure.</p>

<p>In the book, there are pictures of little builds that kids are encouraged to make and there are even some instructions included for some of the builds. I think that this takes away some of the imagination of the book, but it does make it more appealing for smaller kids so I will let this slide.</p>

<p>Overall I think that this was a really good book for the time, but in my opinion it doesn&#39;t hold a candle compared to today&#39;s books. It is a nice antique to have, but it is not much more than that.</p>
