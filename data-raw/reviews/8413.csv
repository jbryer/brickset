"MarsNeedsLEGO","2010-12-18T15:34:30.957Z","The gift(card) of LEGO","I have the 'distinction' of working at a Target store in Texas, and was pleasantly surprised to see this on the giftcard rack one day. I grabbed one and placed it in my shopping basket and headed to the front to checkout. <br/><br/>When told that the minimum amount one can place on a giftcard is five dollars, I was somewhat dismayed. But the cashier cheerfully suggested I put five dollars on the card and use it toward the remainder of my purchases. Brilliant! And that's exactly what I did, making this the first and only LEGO set I've ever acquired at absolutely no cost.<br/><br/>That alone should make it 5/5, but in addition to the value, this set also features some interesting pieces (the white 'teeth' for ears, a printed eye on a 1x1 brick, and the ubiquitous Target bullseye logo printed on another)&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;a nice little plastic box to store them in while disassembled. I can only give it a 4 for playability (being an employee and seeing the dog plastered everywhere does tend to diminish its charm), but otherwise I highly recommend this set. Get it while you can!",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

"MorkMan","2011-03-05T23:16:29.82Z","Well worth the price..","This little set popped out at me during Christmas of 2010. I saw it on the end-cap by the greeting cards at my local Target. I pulled it off the hook and took it to an employee nearby. She confirmed that it was a gift card and that I was indeed, free (with a minimum of $5 put on the card). I was the second to last one and she told me that was all they had and wouldn't be getting any more. I didn't pick p the second set. I figured I would spread the love to another Lego fan. It sits on my bookshelf right now and is a great little set to show off. It's a great conversation piece (as if the other dozen sets aren't) sitting on my shelf in my office. I'm happy to own it since it didn't seem to be a huge seller. Is it my favorite piece? No, but it's definitely a cool addition to my collection!<p></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
