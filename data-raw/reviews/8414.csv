A fantastic price with the new light-up brick which is a very bright light BTW. <br>The main model stands at just under 6 inches tall. It is very poseable, except the legs, I would of likes an ankle joint, and moving the stiff click hinges on the foot cause the leg to come apart on my model. A 7-long technic beam keeps the body in one piece.<br>The build wasn't anything new, but not boring or too repetitive.<br><br>Cheapest way to get the light bricks, and I will be finding this robot headless for a lot of MOCs where I can add some light.<br><br>Special parts:<br>4 silver robot arms<br>2 silver tooth bricks<br>1 silver studless slope <br>1 light up brick<br>8 ball and socket bricks<br><br>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,5
"AETerry","2011-04-07T15:29:48.58Z","Rescue Robot Review","<p>The only other set that I have to really compare this one too is the Power Miners' Crystal King <a title=""View full details of set 8962: Crystal King"" href=""../../detail/?Set=8962-1""><strong><FONT color=#51abff size=2>8962</FONT></strong></a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The robot stands about an inch smaller then the Crystal King. And where I paid out $19.99 for the King, the Robot is $16.99. The Crystal King still has its coolness factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rescue Robot though also has rankings for coolness in that it's instructions give you three different builds and models you can make, so it comes down to a matter of preference. While the Robot has many cool features and pieces from the ball joints for the limbs and the light pieces for the head and features overall a good solid build.... when it comes to the feet of the robot, like the one other reviewer has commented on... I'd have liked better ankle articulation and have problems myself with the feet breaking when trying to bend them according to the joint pieces there. On the Crystal King, you see a similiar design for the feet, but unlike the Robot, I have had no problems with the feet breaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then as more a matter of personal preference, the hands of the Robot, I'd have liked to haven seen a thumb design like the King's... not a spike piece that sticks out suggesting a thumb and has no posability. Basically the Robot is in a mode of giving you a permanent two thumbs up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As this is the first Creators set I've picked up, I do like it, and the price is better then that of the Crystal Kings when comparing similiar builds.

"vexorian","2011-06-14T12:32:51.01Z","Great parts pack, not so great design","I have always loved LEGO robots. Specially like Creator robots because of that vintage feel that LEGO wouldn't risk getting in the more action-ish themes. So when saw the first pics of this set I was already set to get the set. Today, I found out the 2011 sets arrived to store, so this set was the first&nbsp; I got.<br><br>I built the three designs. I think the robo dog is probably the strongest desgin-wise because it does not have the articulation issues of the other two. On the other hand the reason for that is that it does not intend to have articulation at all. Anyway, I will be reviewing mainly the main design. The other robot has basically the same flaws, the main difference are the head and the right arm, really.&nbsp; They are smaller than you would think after looking at the cgi pics, but that is not a big problem to me, I would rather have small and bulky than tall and skeletal.<br><br>The thing is, that the robot has hard time posing, and it is not because of a lack of articulation pieces. It is more related to the way they are used. Specifically, the legs are very articulated, but in the wrong direction (laterally). Whereas for legs you would prefer front/backwards articulation. When something with legs cannot be made to look like walking, there is a problem.<br><br>The second weakness is with the arms, although it is not nearly as bad as the legs. The articulations are in the correct direction. And it is fairy articulated, but there is not much you can do in comparison with even the least expensive Bionicle sets of old.<br><br>What is really disappointing about the arms, is the hands, two exo-form arms (fingers) per hand is really not enough. The designers put a silver claw to simulate an extra finger but it does not quite work. What is really not nice about this is that with 6 of those arms in the new silver color, the piece pack quality of this set would have also improved.<br><br>Finally, the head is a little limited in movement, but perhaps it is better that way.<br><br>I ended up modding the leg-foot connection without using pieces from another source. I basically rotated each foot 90 degrees to the left (or right) and then put the connection again, so that the articulation becomes forward-backward instead of lateral. The side effect is that the 'front' of the legs becomes completely red, whether this looks better or not is up to your opinion. I do see why the designers didn't go this way, and it is that it seems a little weak. Overall, what I would have done is used bionicle articulations to connect the leg to the foot.<br><br>It is however, a Creator set, and the main point of these sets is for the kids to create&nbsp; new things. The other models are different enough to motivate them to rebuild and rebuild and rebuild. The pieces available are good sci-fi fodder. For the price I actually liked the bricks the set comes with:<br>* Curve slopes in black and red.<br>* The silver slope used in the head.<br>* The four exo-force arms/fingers.<br>* Note that the silver used is a new color. It is a little darker than the silver used in previous years and more metallic.<br>* The standard things you would expect to find in transparent colors, like cones, studs and 2x1 plates, in trans yellow.<br>* The four system ball cups and the four system articulation balls. They are the new molds. They are clearly stronger than the ones used in the previous years, and it is easier to insert the balls in the ball cups.<br>* Some wing pieces.<br>* And of course, the reason many fans will get this set: The light brick. I think this is the least expensive set to get it, and since the main design is not a great asset, there will not be a lot of guilt to use the light brick in other situations. This is the first time I get one of the new light bricks, in comparison with the old bricks, the new one is clearly more useful (easier to fit in sets and MoCs) and has VERY strong light and the battery can be replaced.<br>* Overall the bricks feel stronger and of better quality than on previous years, but this is subjective.<br><br>So overall, I do not regret getting it because the pieces were a good deal for the price. Wish the main design had better articulation though.<br>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The light brick is just a cute little touch to this set, a function.<br></li><li>-The parts selection is varied very much and is great for a parts set. The model is also cute and great.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The articulation of the arms and legs is a strong weak point of this set.<br></li><li>-I would have liked the gray parts to all be silver gray, just to add that nice little extra touch.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is small and powerful. The designer obviously has skill in the area of set design overall. Buy it if you can.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,4
