<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>It was great to have a genuine Lego storage cabinet... Unfortunately, by that time in my life (probably aged around 10 years old), I already had FAR too much LEGO to fit/sort into these drawers!&nbsp;So I still needed plenty of ice-cream tubs, and other containers to store it in.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Eventually all the lego went into a large home-made mat/sheet, (similar to the Lego drawstring bag), but I still used the drawers/cabinet for a lot of the small/rare parts, so they&nbsp;weren't&nbsp;so hard to find.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Cabinet was very &quot;Ikea-like&quot;... White laminated chipboard, pre-drilled holes, and an allen-key to assemble the cabinet.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>I think it's still in my fathers shed to this day! 25+ years old!</div>

The cabinet fits 4 trays, that came in red or blue. It certainly was sturdy, as the cabinet owned by my husband from 1984, with 4 trays, is still in daily&nbsp;use by our own children now. The cabinet can be used neatly to display a range of smaller newly-built sets.</p>
