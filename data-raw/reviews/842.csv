The individual bags make the small things you can see in the picture. Every three or four small bags, you can make a slightly bigger concoction. There are a lot more blocks and slopes than there are plates, although it is nice to get a few odd pieces like the clear slopes, the propellers and the skateboard wheels. You can build the big spaceship - it looks a little like the old classic space models - but it is a bit fragile and piece meal. This is a fun set for an advent calendar, and would be great for small kids travelling or staying with grandparents, etc, but it is only an ordinary parts set or basic collection.
