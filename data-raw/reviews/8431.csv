<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has the classic&nbsp;Lego logo on each side, and the mug is a nice bright white, and has stayed in this colour after three&nbsp;months use. It is a good size for a cuppa - not too small and also not too large, the capacity is 350ml. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not made from bone china, so for those that would like a&nbsp;'proper' cuppa, stick to bone china,&nbsp;but for ordinary tea, coffee, and hot chocolate, I have found it does the job perfectly. Some mugs have a habit of cracking after some use due to the hot water, but this one has no cracks showing. It states on the box it is dishwasher and microwave safe, but as I don't have either, I am unable to advise on these, and how it might effect its looks and longevity.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â£5.99 for the mug is on a par with other mugs I have brought, so I feel it is a good reasonable price. When you look at what Lego sets you can buy for this money, I feel the mug provides better value for money, and bound to be sort after by adults and older children alike. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Lego builder in your life, this will make a lovely treat for them, or treat yourself to it. </p>

My old non LEGO mug was worn out and whats a better replacement than a cup with my favorite company logo on it? I use it primarily for coffee and been using it once everyday and put in the dishwasher every night. Time will tell if the logo will fade, but it looks like it will last for a long time. Also it is a little bit taller than normal coffee cups. Maybe about a centimeter taller.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>LEGO logo</li><li>Little bit taller than other cups</li><li>Looks durable<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Should of been available in colors other than white. Blue or yellow would be great.<br></li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>$10 USD is not a bad price for this mug as it is essential for every morning.<br></p>",TRUE,5,1,1,2,5
