The minifigure is of Darth Vader (duh) and has the usual printing on the front apart from the clock. The helmet can not be taken off but the arms and legs are movable. The controls on the back can be tiresome if you drastically need to change the minute and does tend to slow down. The batteries are quite reliable but have to be replaced every other year at most. It comes with a snooze and alarm function. If you press down the head, the clock lights up. At a certain angle, it is quite hard to see and might reflect light or could be hard to differentiate between 6 and 8. The light is red.&nbsp;<br />

Overall, the clock is pretty good but there are some better designs.</p>
