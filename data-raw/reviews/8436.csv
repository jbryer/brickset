as I saw this on Lego Shop-at-home, I knew I had to have it.&nbsp; It is 
fully pose-able with moving arms, legs, hands, and head.&nbsp; When you press the head, it activates the clock's backlight.&nbsp; The backlight is orange.&nbsp; 
Pressing on the head also makes the alarm snooze.&nbsp; The clock is very easy to set and use.&nbsp; I recommend this clock to anyone 
who loves Lego minifigs, Star Wars, or both!&nbsp; It is a MUST HAVE for all 
Lego fans young and old.&nbsp; Buy one NOW if you can find it!&nbsp; Thank you Lego.<br>",TRUE,5,1,1,3,4
