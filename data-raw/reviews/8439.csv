Ever since I saw that the Pyramid set comes with Anubis guards I've been pining for one. And now with this key ring, I can at least enjoy having one, even if he has a metal chain coming out of his head.</p><p>It was my hope that I could remove the chain, and so far I have been thwarted (albeit that's because I haven't really tried that hard yet). The detail is fantastic for a minifigure, with gold highlights outlining the ears, red eyes, six pack and kilt. The&nbsp;headpiece&nbsp;is also wonderfully sculpted, I especially like his nose. The dark blue used to outline his abs can be a bit hard to see against the black of his fur, but will show if in decent lighting.</p><p>The only major drawback to this figure is that because of the construction, you are unable to disassemble the figure like you could a normal one. You could also say that lack of weapons could be a fault as well, but I'm not that picky. There is no building&nbsp;experience&nbsp;as he comes (permanently) pre-assembled, no additional parts as he would surely lose em, and playabilty is quite limited as there is a heavy metal chain chilling out on top of his head. BUT! That does not really bear any weight whatsoever as this set isn't technically meant for play.</p><p>I will be honest, I would much prefer to have an actual Anubis minifigure, but this set is an EXCELLENT stand in until I get one. And the fact he was on sale was made all the sweeter.</p><p></p>",TRUE,5,1,1,2,5
