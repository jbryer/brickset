"legowomen1980p","2010-12-05T00:04:35.013Z","Awesome pieces, But many of them feel like cheaper chinese quality found in extended line products","Pros:<br><br>1. Awesome new pcs.<br>2. lots of color<br>3. lots of detail<br>4. awesome set to build an army<br>5. New wings are awesome looking<br><br><br><br>Cons:<br>1. new weapons feel like inferior plastic (sword and spear) very flimsy, not solid plastic, cheap quality.<br>2. so does new head gear and top of sarcophagus along with some bricks feel like a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; different sort of mix of plastic.<br>3. New wings feel very cheaply made out of some new plastic formula used by lego.<br><br><br>This set was really made for AFOL's who collect Lego and don't intend on playing with them. This is the type of set you build once and don't touch. if you were to play with it, the pieces could break or the color could fade away. In the world we live in today, it is not like it was 50 years ago when things were made to last. This set was made to break and crack over time if played with, this way it forces you to buy another. I hoped Lego would not go this way with it's toys. But this set is just the beginning. The beginning to an end to making toys last a lifetime.<br><br>I really hope Lego doesn't get it paint from China..<br>",TRUE,3,3,2,1,2
"legoDad42","2010-12-26T20:07:50.83Z","Great Battlepack!","<p>Great addition to the Pharaoh's Quest theme...the Skeleton Mummy Battlepack is a must get for your Egyptian 'army of the undead' Moc's, excellent for Pharoah Quest Mod's and overall collector's of unique mini-figs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of what ya' get...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 Flying Mummy mini-fig</strong>. Same figure you see from Flying Mummy Attack with beautifully painted, single winged piece and dark blue Horus headed helmet with 'wedjat' graphics. No weapon though. 
<li><strong>1 Mummy Warrior mini-fig</strong> (similar to fig. from Cursed Cobra Statue) w/Pharaoh-like dark tan head-dress adorned with dark blue snake graphics and all new dark, pearl gray sickle sword. 
<li><strong>1 Mummy Warrior mini-fig</strong> (similar to fig. from Cursed Cobra Statue) w/Pharoah-like dark tan head dress adorned with dark blue snake graphics, black spear and all new, nicely designed Scarab-shield. 
<li><strong>1 Pharaoh Sarcofagus</strong> (similar mold to the Adventurer's Egyptian sarcofagi), pearl gold top/lid and dark blue base/coffin. Inside you'll find 1 red snake, 6 gems (trans colored&nbsp;red, 2 turqoise, yellow, blue and green), and 2 trans red studs. 
<li><strong>2 Black Scorpians</strong>.</li></ul>
<p><em>Note: All 3 mini-figs have same graphics for head(Dueled faced-2 red eyes and teeth on one side, other side one red eye peeking through the wraps), torso (mummy wrap graphics with detailed necklace front and back) and legs (graphics on front only). </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, for $15.00, this is a great 'battlepack'. Since now we know that the magnet sets are mostly glued (and those went for $15.00 anyways) this is an excellent value since you get more for similar price. I'm hoping they'll have more Pharaoh's Quest Battle Packs with Anubis Warrior figs. and accessories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great for the MOC'ers and MOD'ers out there. This is the type of set that spurs your imagination. Just from this simple set you can Moc an entire fantasy scene around this.</p>
<p><strong><em>I highly recommend it.</em></strong></p>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5
"AETerry","2011-04-06T20:36:31.84Z","Mummy Battle Pack Review","<p>At $15, I get that this pack has 3 minifigures, the sarcophagi, 2 scorpions, snake and 2 1x1 red transparent pieces and 6 gems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought it, so that says something to the fact it's worth getting. The Minifigures are well detailed. One of which is a flying mummy. I love it. Hopefully in the future when we see wings, we can see other prints and angles they're ""held"" at for the molds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aesthetics wise, I would much prefer the black head pieces from <a title=""View full details of set 7306: Golden Staff Guardians"" href=""../../detail/?Set=7306-1""><strong><FONT color=#51abff size=2>7306</FONT></strong></a>
<SCRIPT type=text/javascript>$().ready(function() { $('#b8303').jqm({ ajax: '/ajax/getInstructions.aspx?SetID=8303', trigger: '#c8303' }); });</SCRIPT>
 Golden Staff Guardians. As well as a second scarab shield in the pack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Battle Packs normally have up to 5 figures in them, I can see the trade out of one for the sarcophagi, which in turns acts as&nbsp;a treasure chest to hold the gemstones in. And that's a goodly ammount of gemstones to have in this pack or any set. And a variety of colors to boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess after that the scorpions and snake take the place of another minifigure? I like the scorpions. Having those is cool, not too many of them yet and they can be gotten from the Pick-A-Brick section of Lego.com at .28 cents a piece. The snake I don't really care for, but that's just me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see how it all values out, equals and is worth the $15. But it just doesn't feel that way. If Lego releases another Pharoah's Quest Battle pack, I hope it will be one that has more Anubis minifigures, has a full 5 minifigures and leaves off the little ""extras"".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd have prefer to have seen at least 4 minifigures with this set the more I think on it.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,3
"legoparent","2010-12-31T07:14:58.74Z","No Treasure in the Closet, Only Skeletons","<p>Pharoah's Quest great theme, and continuation of the Adventurer's theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figures are highly detailed, but would like to have at least five figures in the pack, such as the knights kingdom packs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, an ok set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Con:</p>
<p>Very high priced for what little you get.&nbsp; Wait for a sale on the pack, or just buy the pharaoh's quest sets, more for your money.</p>

"The_Reviewer","2011-05-14T15:42:35.123Z","A good set,but overpriced","<p>I went to a lego store and decided to buy this,because it's exclusive,but I was surprised to see that this set is $15 (I thought it would be $10).Anway this set has some good pieces like The:Coffin-tomb piece,two scorpions,two red snakes,a shield,a sword and some gems. The 3 minifigures are two snake-designed headgear mummies and a flying mummy.And&nbsp;there&nbsp;is not much of a build,everthing is pre built.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Realy good pieces (cheapest way to get Coffin-tomb thing) 
<li>Pretty good minifigs 
<li>Scorpions</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Overpriced (should be $10,not $15) 
<li>
<li>This is a pretty good set.But buy it if you find it on sale.-Thanks for reading.</li></ul>

"bluemodern","2012-01-05T20:22:35.52Z","Nice minifigs but everything is pre-built","I bought this set on sale for $3.50 at the Lego website. The retail price in the US is $15, which I think is way too much for what you get. The set comes in a blister pack instead of a box and all of the minfigs are already put together when you buy it (as can be seen from the second image on brickset). This takes away some of the fun since there isn't anything to build/put together (hence, there is no instruction booklet for this set). There are 3 minifigs, 2 scorpions, a snake, a sarcophagus, a spear, a&nbsp;shield, a sword, and some jewels. That's it.<div><br></div><div>On the positive side, the minifigs and sarcophagus look great and are well done. All of the minifigs have printing on both sides of their torsos. The flying mummy looks excellent, again both sides of the wings are also printed and the mummy's cap has printing on it of a bird as well. The sarcophagus also looks very nice with the embossed shape of a minfig on the lid.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This set can be helpful if you want to build a mummy army. If you can get this on sale it is good, but I cannot recommend this set at full price.</div>",TRUE,3,4,1,4,1
"tomasubrick","2012-08-20T09:17:48.037Z","Mummy Battle Pack","<p>I went to LEGOland (Windsor) and bought this after coming out from the lazer raiders ride-as there is a shop after the ride-for Â£8.99. It comes with 3 mummys (flying and 2 mummy warriors), 2 scorpions and a&nbsp;sarcophagus full of ""treasure"" (2 clear red studs, 2 blue gems,dark blue gem,red gem,yellow gem and a green gem) and a red snake.</p><p>The Mummy Warriors have 2 faces (one on the back and the front) one normal and one with just one eye.
