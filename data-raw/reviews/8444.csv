buying her, but after I had her in hand I started to see the 
possibilities of the figure as well as the parts.<br><h4>Design</h4>The legs of the figure appear to have on a green bathing suit.&nbsp; The torso of the figure has printing that looks like a green bikini top with a flower lei.&nbsp; The face has a wonderful smile, and the hair is black with a printed flower!&nbsp; She comes with the LEGO version of a grass skirt (made of similar material to minifig capes), and two of the maraca piece from the Series 2 Mariachi, which in this case I assume are meant to represent gourd rattles such as Uli uli.<br><h4>Playability</h4>The figure as a whole would fit equally well in many LEGO themes.&nbsp; For LEGO City she could be at a vacation paradise (need somewhere for the planes to fly, right?) or dressed up for a beach party.&nbsp; If Pirates is your thing, she could be a native islander.&nbsp; I could see her in Indiana Jones and other adventure themes as well.<br><h4>Parts</h4>If you want to use the parts rather than the figure, again you have several possibilities.&nbsp; The hairpiece with the printed flower could be used for a flower child of the 60's or a minifig out on a romantic date.&nbsp; The legs could be used on a male figure to represent a green bathing suit.&nbsp; I haven't thought of alternate uses for the gourd rattles (other than Maracas) or grass skirt yet, but I'm sure there are plenty.<br><h4>Cons</h4>There is one thing LEGO could have done better, making the lei a separate piece instead of printing it on the torso.&nbsp; That would have opened the possibility of having other tourist figures wearing a lei, and it also would have allowed you to use the green bikini torso as a more general female bathing suit.<br><h4>Summary</h4>Overall I really like the hair printing, and the add-on skirt is great as well.&nbsp; Hopefully we'll see more cloth skirts instead of dresses printed on slope pieces.&nbsp; This is a great minifigure and hopefully a sign of more good things to come.&nbsp; ",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

The details on this character are very nice and we also get some nice markings on the hair as well. I really can't complain about this figure.<br><br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and

"legospongepotter","2011-03-12T10:14:28.01Z","Welcome to Hawaii","<p>This was a surprise when I got this Minifigure in a bag. I didn't want this, I thought the Minifigure was the mummy or something. My mom doesn't like it because she says the Minifigure is 'innapropriate' for someone my age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hair of this Minifigure is pretty cool, it's black and kind of hangs over the shoulders. The hair is a little common in brown. However, this has a pink flower printed on it that was definitely a cool feature.</p>
<p>She's got a big grin on her face like she's at a luau or something fun at the beach. Red lipstick outlines her mouth.</p>
<p>The torso of this Minifigure is basically a green bra that is not printed on the back and one of those flowery necklaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her legs have a printed bikini bottom that is also green. However, a grass skirt that attaches similar to the way cloaks attach to Minifigures, except this attaches to the legs and stretches completely around the Minifigure except on one side. Other than that, the legs are yellow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite part of this set are the maracas. &nbsp;They are brown and looks pretty cool, and I'm glad that there were two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She comes with a little black sort of&nbsp;pedestal&nbsp;piece.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall,&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;not the best Minifigure but anyone living in Hawaii would like this, as with the Caribbean. There are much cooler&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;and some parents might say it's innapropriate.&nbsp;</p>

"AETerry","2011-04-07T20:55:59.687Z","Hula Dancer Review","<p>First.... I don't get the point of the maraccas she's holding, I think more of Mexico with those then Hawaii or other Polynesian cultures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I can see... a MOC build with a bunch of Lego Tourists exiting a plane and being greeted by a bunch of these minis to Hawaii... just one idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A clear and definitive female face is great. That's good for MOC building and set ups. The hair piece is stunning with the flower printed on it. That really makes it. The Grass Skirt was a bit of a pain to get attached to the legs, but looks alright. It doesn't completely go around as shown in the picture, but it does the job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very decent otherwise, just if I had been hand picking out minis instead of getting them randomly, this wouldn't have been one of my choices and since getting her, she's kind of grown on me, must be that winning smile. I'll place her next to my baseball player whom I didn't think would be one I wanted.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,4
"Berrus_Brickus","2011-02-07T15:58:40.097Z","Dashboard Shaker!","<p>I ordered about twelve CM randomly from LEGO.com.&nbsp; I was rather pleased to find two of this little lady inside.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The Hula Girl, as well as all other CM, come random in a lime green packet showing the sixteen figures posing, with the rarer ones in the front, <em>""You never know which one you'll get!""</em></p>
<p>The instructions are on a little flyer showing the basic anatomy of a minifigure and some examples of what goes where.&nbsp; On the other side there is a checklist of the sixteen figures.&nbsp; I am not&nbsp;as happy with the hula girl's flyer as I would be with any of the other sixteen (with the exception of the Fisherman).&nbsp; This is because the grass skirt is hard to apply, and even when I figured it out, it still sticks out at one part.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p><strong>Hair Piece</strong></p>
<p>Here you get an over shoulder (what else to call it?) hair piece introduced in 2009 in black with a little pink flower printed.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Head</strong></p>
<p>The only piece that I hate almost entirley, it would be fine, but the mouth is opened very wide.&nbsp; I liked the snowboarder's face on her a bit more.</p>
<p><strong>Torso</strong></p>
<p>A nice torso which when paired with the legs creates a green bikini suitable for any <em>female </em>vacationer.&nbsp; The torso is a simple yellow torso with a green bating suit top with a Hawaiin flower chain (I don't know the name) hanging above it.&nbsp; The back is blank like most other CM.&nbsp; My only complaint here is just a little embarassing, I personally think that she would look better with a belly button. :p</p>
<p><strong>Legs</strong></p>
<p>A simple green bikini bottom.&nbsp; I am not certain, but it may be identical (with a different color of course) to the S2 lifeguard.</p>
<p><strong>Skirt</strong></p>
<p>A little grass skirt that stretches around her waist.&nbsp; I didn't find it very clear how to place it, and it still seems to stick out at an end.&nbsp; This could be fixed if LEGO had added a fourth hole to the skirt, assuming&nbsp;I applied it correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Maracas/Rattles</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Not sure what to say except I have never seen a Hula dancer equipped with rattles before, but what do I know?</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>See the photo. . . .</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Not much, but not much fun either building a stiff chinese figure.&nbsp; And as said before, it isn't clear how to apply the skirt.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>See minifigures</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>In conclusion,&nbsp;the grass skirt is hard to apply. :p</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,4
"sideswinger","2020-08-25T01:30:18.59Z","One of my favorites!","<p>So fourteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3 is the Hula Dancer, and she is a pretty neat figure. She was released in 2011, retailed for three bucks, and includes 8 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that hair piece, which is a pretty cool part. The piece was not new, nor was the coloring. But the cool thing is, it has a pink flower on the side. That is pretty cool looking, and I just like how it came out.</p>

<p>Next we have her face, which has a very nice expression, which is that big chipper smile. I really love how that turned out, and I always like when LEGO gives us generic faces; they&#39;re very useful for custom minifigures. She has no alternate face either, which is common for lots of CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Then we have her torso, which does look really cool. I love that flower necklace (I know there&#39;s a word for that, but I can&#39;t think of it!). She also has those curve lines on the sides, and she has no back printing, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Then we have her skirt, which is where things get very controversial. See, all the official pics of her (including this one) have that cut-styled hula skirt, with the separate strips of fabric. However, the REAL pics of her have a totally different design, to where it has no slits, and some points all along the bottom border. So this pic has a really cool design, while the REAL figure has a design that&#39;s not very accurate to your typical hula dancer.</p>

<p>Then we have her legs, which do have a bit of printing underneath with the green and all. It does look a little weird, as if the top section and the printing below are disconnected, but oh well.</p>

<p>Then we have her accessories, which look pretty good. They are just those Series 2 maraca pieces without printing, and they look good-in person. When my sister seen this picture she thought they were chicken legs. Well from the front, she&#39;s not wrong.</p>

<p>Anyway, my overall rating of this figure is a four. I really love some specific parts of her, like the hair, head, and torso, as well as her accessory. Pretty much every part of the figure, besides her skirt. That part of her just doesn&#39;t work for me. And while the three dollar price might be a&nbsp;little much, it isn&#39;t that bad. And I think that wraps up this review! So if you found this review helpful, check out my Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and thank you for reading!</p>
