Being Native America and a AFOL, this is byfar one of the best figures that I have added to my collection. I admire the detail that was put into the head dress, the art work on his clothes and the face paint. This figure along wth the Tribal Huntress from series 1&nbsp;make for a great couple.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think for the &nbsp;price of series 3 vs series 1 &amp; 2 that it is over priced for the element to dollar ratio. </p>

"spokeydokeyjenner_jones","2011-01-24T15:23:57.457Z","Another great minifigure!","<p>This is one of the best mini-figs in this series, and also I&#39;ve had some thoughts about making my own Indian village.<br />
<br />
And would you believe it; they even detailed the back of the head-dress. I&#39;ve named the cowboy from S1 as Six-Gun Sid and the Indian Hunter as Forest Eagle, and now I&#39;ve named this Chief Blistered Fish-lips. They have the same spear as the Spartan Warrior, and there are now three Wild West mini-figures, with the mariachi counting as the fourth in my opinion (mainly for a Mexican MOC).<br />
<br />
So let&#39;s look out for more of these special plastic small-fries, but for me, it&#39;s mainly the historical ones I enjoy the most.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2011-03-02T13:21:33.14Z","Needs a Shield","<p>Set #8803 Tribal Chief: I got this Mini-Figure just recently so I haven't studied it closely enough, but I am still pleased that I got it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detail on this figure is striking, standing next to my Western Tribal Chief you can see the subtle differences between a Mini-Figure from over ten years ago to the new interpretation of today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accessory wise, the Tribal Chief includes a nice new spear piece, apparently it came with the Spartan, but since I have none of Series Two yet I can't verify this. And of course the headdress is familiar to anyone who collected the Western Theme from the middle to late 90's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His print is truly stellar looking, overall I'd have to say with him you could have two seperate tribes for your Western display now, this Mini-Figure has bare arms, I believe we don't see that very often in LEGO Mini-Figures. Although he wasn't high on my list of Mini-Figures to get from Series Three I am still proud to have him. The facial print is also very nice looking. I wish he included a tribal shield to go with that spear though.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4

<p>The minifigure is okay. I think it would have been better with a different face. The head does not look like an indian (in my opinion).&nbsp;I've never seen an indian with such&nbsp;a huge smile.&nbsp;I don't think this minifigure&nbsp;is worth the price. I say it's worth&nbsp;$1.&nbsp;One good thing about this minifigure -&nbsp;it comes with a new, realistic spear! The spear looks great! Overall it's average. All of the pieces are pretty good other than the head.</p>

He is very easy to find (by feeling for the&nbsp; headgear) the spear is&nbsp; the same as the Spartan's From Series 2 (exept the stick is brown) and the printing on his torso,legs and Headgear, are very well done.</p>

"AETerry","2011-04-12T12:36:47.65Z","Tribal Chief Review","<p>The last package I open and I finally got the Tribal Chief. Which means I really took the time to feel the packages for his very distinctive head dress.</p>

<p>The print job like much of the CMs is very good. The spear is different then any I've seen before with Lego Castle outside of the CM series. </p>

"Harmonious_Building","2012-06-01T09:48:37.457Z","Laconic Lakota in LEGO.","<p>The history of (white) America's treatment of the numerous Native American tribes is a sordid one, and one that seems to continue to be somewhat whitewashed even to this day. LEGO itself has been guilty of perpetuating the mythicised ""<a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Western&amp;subtheme=Indians"">Cowboys vs Indians</a>"" storyline, which serves as obvious inspiration for this iteration of the Tribal Chief.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But we'll leave politics and history out of this and instead look at our dear Tribal Chief for what he is: a piece of collectible plastic that serves&nbsp;as a visual (if&nbsp;stereotypical)&nbsp;representative&nbsp;for Native Americans as a whole.&nbsp;I'm no expert on Native American culture and iconography by any means, but my initial reaction to looking at Tribal Chief is that he is an allusion to the great Lakota chief <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Sitting_Bull_%28Tatonka-I-Yatanka%29%2C_a_Hunkpapa_Sioux%2C_1885_-_NARA_-_530896_edit.tif"">Sitting Bull</a>, who, incidentally, is the subject of the&nbsp;largest LEGO statue in Legoland Billund. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tribal Chief has obvious similiarities to the previous tribal chief as seen in, well, Tribal Chief (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6709-1"">6709</a>), the leader of the ""Indians"" in the thusly-titled subtheme of Western. I never was able to get my hands on the largest Indian sets as a kid, though I did have some of the smaller ones and therefore a few Indian Minifigs. The headpiece, the most striking part of Tribal Chief, has changed minimally,&nbsp;and remains -&nbsp;now as it was then - an impressively detailed piece that is clearly meant to represent the famous feathered headgear of (some?) Native American tribes. This new Tribal Chief has also traded his ugly red legs for a more uniform colour scheme, a choice which is much appreciated, at least by me. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The best change, in my opinion, is the face. I'm not sure what peyote was involved with the designs of the faces of the original Indian Minifigs, but they just never sat well with me. Minifigs? With noses? And with distinguishable features around their eyes? I guess I can appreciate how detailed those faces were, but they just struck me as being distinctly un-LEGO looking and slightly scary. The face on this Tribal Chief, on the other hand, follows the template of the contemporary LEGO faces and adds cool war paint, which makes him so much more palatable to me. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The one thing that I did like from the old Tribal Chief, though, was the little feather pieces attached to the spear and also his tribal shield. Both of these are sadly lacking from this Tribal Chief, but, on the other hand, there's nothing stopping you from cannabilising these pieces from your old Indian sets if you so desire. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I do appreciate LEGO putting out Collectible Minifigs from different cultures, so Tribal Chief ranks highly in my book. Fans of the old Indian subtheme may have differing opinions on the updated look, but newcomers experiencing LEGO Native America for the first time will surely love this tribal leader. </p>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,3
"sideswinger","2020-08-11T21:42:16.793Z","A pretty cool figure!","<p>So the third figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3&nbsp;is the Tribal Chief, and he was released in 2011, retailed for three bucks, and includes five pieces. To me he&#39;s a decent figure, but nonetheless, let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>So starting from top to bottom, we have that huge&nbsp;hat piece, and gosh, it looks amazing. I&#39;m just in love with the piece. It has some extremely intricate detail&nbsp;and I just really love how they actually went the extra mile to mould hair back there. Not sure if it&#39;s dual moulded, but I would guess it&#39;s printed. Then we have that awesome moulding all around the sides for the feathers, and he has some great printing as well&nbsp;with the blue, red, and tiny bits of yellow. Just an awesome piece. However, with that being said, the part was not new for the figure. I must say, that is pretty unfortunate, and while it does make the figure a little less interesting, it&#39;s still an interesting piece.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which has just some alright printing. It just looks pretty generic, with that chipper smile. That smile actually looks sort of strange, since, (as far as I can tell,) tribal leaders don&#39;t smile quite that much. But I&#39;m not a tribal leader, so what do I know. No alternate face either, which is common for lots of CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso, which I must admit, has some complex printing for its time. He has some extremely intricate detail, with the red, white, and blue lines. His arms are plain yellow as well, with no printing. No back printing either, which its weird how the figures in Series&#39; 1, 2, and 3 have no back printing.</p>

<p>Next are his legs, which also have some pretty good printing overall. I love how the printing carries on from the waist down through the legs. I also like the tiny red and blue triangles on the sides of the printing. No side leg printing, which is just fine.</p>

<p>And finally, we have his accessory, which is just that spear. Nothing special, but it was new-ish back then. It was introduced a year before this series, and I don&#39;t know if the color was new or not. And I didn&#39;t know this until I bought the Viking from Series 20, but that tip is caste in rubber, so that&#39;s sort of interesting. And as you can see, the bottom is caste in what&#39;s known as that reddish brown color.</p>

<p>So overall, this is a figure that&#39;s sort of grown on me. While he includes no new parts, I&#39;m just so intrigued by his hat piece, and it&#39;s packed in a relatively cheap three dollar figure, which is neat. And this dude goes great with the Series 1 Tribal Hunter too. Just a pretty good figure for his value and all. And I think that wraps up this review, so check out my other Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>

"AlkkuV","2022-02-04T16:58:13.547Z","Tribal Chief.","<p>Hello, guys, it&#39;s AlkkuV, back with another review. Another series 3 minifigure review: Tribal Chief. Let&#39;s see what do I think about it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: Again, just a basic series 3 bag and the booklet with all the mini-figs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MInifigure: So, the minifigure, Tribal Chief is actually a very good minifigure. The figure has a brown spear, with a silver tip. The hair piece is amazing, and the print on the torso and legs is good-looking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: This set has a total of six pieces. I think all of them are unique, but i&#39;m not sure about the spear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: The build is easy, just put the mini-fig together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete Build: Overall, I like the figure. Some very rare pieces in this one, too. I just realised, that I have so many figures that I won&#39;t be able to review them all. Overall, I would give this set a 4.6/5.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and stay toon for more reviews!</p>
