"legospongepotter","2011-01-01T01:00:17.393Z","Awesome Minifigure!!","This guy is pretty cool. New, of course, a series three Minifigure, and very well done. He comes with the black stand and the bag and 'instructions.'<div><br></div><h4>Legs: &nbsp;</h4><div>His legs are mainly a nice shade of red. A very bright color, but not the Fire-truck bright. Unlike many Minifigs, he has printing. He has silver armor/mail designed on his....knee? I don't know, its that part of the leg on top that kind of bulges. It is also there on the thin part that connects the legs to the torso. Very nice legs.</div><div><br></div><h4>Torso:&nbsp;</h4><div>He has a sort of light green karate belt, and a red Karate outfit that is often white in movies. He has a yellow flower design on a lot of his torso which I suppose is a little weird. However, I suppose it could be used for the torso of a&nbsp;Japanese&nbsp;lady from ancient Japan. No back-printing, a little&nbsp;disappointing. The samurai has red arms and black hands, like he's wearing gloves. That's always cool.</div><div><br></div><h4>Head:</h4><div>His head, of course, is yellow. He has black sideburns that are attached to a small black beard. He has these fierce thick black eyebrows and a big&nbsp;mustache, and a mouth in a&nbsp;straight&nbsp;line. Underneath his mouth is another triangular beard which is&nbsp;above&nbsp;this thin line of hair - the small beard I was talking about earlier. No double-sided face, sadly.</div><div><br></div><h4>Metal Armor and Weapon:</h4><div><b>Helmet: </b>I love the design of his helmet. Has a sort of hard-hat design but there's this long neck-protector. Then there's this sort of holder for the sword, but I don't think its for that. Really good helmet design.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Armor: </b>Pretty good armor. It covers almost of the real torso Pretty good, has a square hole near the neck to show his neck...weird. Then there's those shoulder flap things that are similar to Pirate and Prince of Persia pieces. They have a square pattern and cover the shoulders. The back is just solid 'metal.'</div><div><br></div><div><b>Sword: </b>Nothing new, here. Just a gray ninja sword with the cool handle design. Not awesome like that great helmet, but good to have a bunch of these.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>OVERALL:&nbsp;</div><div>Very cool and unique minifigure. It goes well with Ninjago, and a collector must have this. Castle fans will also love the armor. If you want to create an Ancient China scene MOC then this guy is good. Worth it. Thanks to Brickset for making me a bronze metal reviewer!</div>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5

"SeptimusHeap","2011-02-12T09:11:26.993Z","One Of The Best","<p>I'm going to use a little different reviewing style, see how it works.</p>
<p>The Samurai Warrior is easily the best fig, in my opinion, in Series 3. He is one of the best overall, just beaten by the Spartan.</p>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Head</span></h4>
<p>The Samurai Warrior's head has a beard running down the sides and the bottom. He also has a small goatee. He has black bushy eyebrows, and a mustache. He has a stern expression. It is very well detailed and printed.</p>
<h4>Torso</h4>
<p>The torso is mostly covered up by the armor piece, but it is a flowered kimono, which could also be used as a woman's dress. It looks a little out of place, but with the armor on, it's fine. No printing on the back, though.</p>
<h4>Legs</h4>
<p>The legs are nice, printed legs with armor on the front.</p>
<h4>Sword</h4>
<p>The Samurai Warrior's sword is nothing new, it's a slightly chrome katana piece, with nice handle texture.</p>
<h4>Helmet</h4>
<p>The helmet is a very nice piece, I don't think it has ever been used before. The top seems very similar to a hard hat piece, it has the lines going down from the top, and makes me wonder if the helmet mold is a variation of the hard hat. There is a clip on the front, so you can attach an old double horn piece. The bottom portion of the helmet goes around the sides and back of the samurai's head, and can hold a visor.</p>
<h4>Armor</h4>
<p>The armor piece is very nice, it has shoulder pads, and front and back padding. It fits between the torso and head.</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,4,4
"Tonebone0011","2011-03-13T21:04:56.973Z","A very awesome minifig to get in series 3","<p>I've spent about half an hour with an older random lego collector feeling out the packets these guys come in. He was looking for a samurai as well but was kind enough to give me the first one he found. Its a shame they are not in the Ninjago set, I'd take samurais over ninjas anyday<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 One of the best looking models in the series 3<br></li><li>Pro 2 Ninjago doesn't have samurais in their sets so this is one of the only ways to get a samurai at this current time<br></li><li>…</li></ul>

"davy_jones","2011-06-10T10:47:47.843Z","Soulful Samurai","<p>I wanted this guy the moment I saw it. When I&nbsp;did get the bag it&nbsp;proved to be full of surprises. To start off, a lot of mention on quality issues with some Lego minifigs have been cropping up. I personally experienced that lack of quality with this piece. The legs seem to be made of a hollow plastic. It feels light and can be marked easily. The chest also has clearly visible mold lines and doesnt have the usual Lego sturdiness. Make no mistake I do like it but quality here needs improvement.</p>
<h4>The Good</h4><p>1. Torso design captures period clothing well</p><p>2. Minifig face is very samurai like</p><p>3. Katana with slightly different design to katana's found in Ninjago. The part between the hilt and blade is hexagonal here. I prefer this design.</p>
<h4>The Bad</h4><p>1. Quality issues</p><p>2. Helmet has curved C-shaped mount in front, but no piece goes there. Samurai pictures show that this area is usually mounted with a curved horn or bone like piece positioned laterally. It could have been included.</p><p>Despite the issues, I'm biased to this minifig because I find the whole Samurai/ Ninja culture intriguing. Dare I say, this minifig's got soul.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4

Missing out on the Ninja theme back in the day I welcome this figure now.&nbsp;<div><br></div><h4>The figure.</h4><div>It has a nice printed robe on the front (flowers) of the torso. Unfortunately, the back isn't printed at all. Front legs have some samurai armour but then again, the back of the legs have none. This samurai warrior has a very stern face, suitable for him (or maybe he's holding his breath?). All of you who dislike the sumo wrestler, I have the perfect solution for his use. Lend the hair piece to the samurai when he's not wearing his helmet. Looks great and fits his samurai side-burns like a glove!</div><div><br></div><h4>The parts/weapons.</h4><div>We get a grey helmet and a cool breast-plate armour, both which I don't think are new. Just a subtle change in colour. And what would a samurai be without his sword? A nice katana is included, though I wish maybe they would have included either a naginata (long spear) or the classic yumi (longbow) also. Not as much a complaint as an idea. It would have been cool.</div><div><br></div><h4>Future.</h4><div>Just thinking, it would be cool if this could continue with asian warriors. There are plenty to choose from, to name a few; Shaolin monk or a cool Mongol with furry boots!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>The front of the figure is just top notch in every way.

"woodall_aidan","2012-04-19T17:08:26.967Z","8803-3 Samurai Warrior","This figure is an AMAZING figure. The samurai warrior has a basic dark-bluish gray samurai helmet piece, which was used in the past in the 1998-2000 theme 'Ninja', but in the previous theme, it was in black, light gray and dark gray. The head has a determined expression, a mustache, a goatee and sideburns. The torso is a dark red torso with a flowery robe pattern. The robe has an elegant look to it. The armor is the basic samurai/ninja armor, but instead of it being dark gray, black or pearl light gray. The legs are dark red and have a greenish gray design on them. Like the ninja from Series 1, this figure is compatible with other themes, such as the old Ninja theme and Ninjago. Overall, this set gets a 5/5.<br>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,4
"AETerry","2011-03-29T13:42:39.35Z","Samurai Warrior Review","<p>When the Oriental Castle Theme came out, some of my favorite minifigures were the samurai, not just the ninjas. And while I appreciate that Ninjago is allowing more people to get a hold of ninja minifigures for their collections... I'm missing having more samurai to work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This guy helps to solve or alleviate the problem. His armor, helmet and sword are definently what was used in the original Oriental theme. But the head piece and minifigure print make this a welcomed and new version of a samurai to have around. Plus he doesn't look as old as one samurai from the old theme.</p>

<p>I think this is a highly recommended 5 star minifigure. The parts of this minifigure look very realistic... better than most of the other CM. It does not have an unrealistic face like some of the other CM, who have huge mouths or crazy faces.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-08-12T02:01:22.343Z","Not the best, not the worst.","<p>So the fourth minifigure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3 is the Samurai Warrior, and he&#39;s a neat figure. He was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces.(The info says seven pcs, but I only see 6.). So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Kicking him off, we have that helmet, which is a neat part. It was not new for the figure, but it&#39;s still a pretty interesting piece. I love the moulding on the sides, and he has that clip on top.&nbsp;It looks sort of out of place, but oh well. Is what it is.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which looks okay. I like that angry frown, as well as his mustache, and his eyebrows really make him look threatening. It isn&#39;t anything to special, but oh well. No alternate face, which is normal for most CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Next we have his breastplate, which looks okay. It wasn&#39;t a new part or anything, but I like how much it fits the character. It has some nice moulding on the sides, at least, and once again, very fitting.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso underneath, which I must say, does have some brilliant printing. I just love how it all came out. It is just that flowery red robe, and he has that waist band as well. Just some awesome printing. No back printing, which is normal for back then.</p>

<p>Then we have his legs, which have more very complex printing for 2011. I mean just look at the layers of color and all. Just some pretty detailed legs overall. And his accessory isn&#39;t much, so let&#39;s discuss it in the same paragraph. It&#39;s just that plain sword caste in black, so a very bland accessory.</p>

<p>And overall, while nothing is new for the figure, all the parts go together really nicely. And while this series is known to be one of the worst, this is a decent figure overall, which is why I gave him a three. Not the best, not the worst. Also, three dollars isn&#39;t a bad price for him. Nowadays, he goes for an estimated fifteen bucks on Ebay, which to be honest isn&#39;t awful. It&#39;s actually a cheaper second-hand price than some Series 20 figures, which is the newest series at the time of this review. But anyway, I think that finishes up this review! So check out my other Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
