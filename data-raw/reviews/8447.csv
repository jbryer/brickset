for most, but to be he is fab. I suppose being a fan of the golden age of
flight biases me a little.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br></p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;"" class=""MsoNormal"">Parts</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">All the special parts are pretty common really, an aviator
helmet, goggles and a backpack that have been around since 1998 and 1989
respectively. The colours are the tempting features here. Dark Brown and Dark
Tan are most desirable and suite the parts well.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br></p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;"" class=""MsoNormal"">Prints</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The torso is a classic Aviator Jacket design and integrates
seamlessly with any Adventurers, Indiana Jones or Pharaoh’s Quest set . The
face, a moustachioed chap, is fitting for a magnificent man with a flying
machine. </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Over all, this is a good figure for any collection. Good
colours and useful print. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The accessories he comes with have been seen before with other sets... like the tan colored backpack and then the aviator helmet with goggles from the Adventurer themes. They're not anything really new or exciting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does help to give this figure appeal and stand out is the print job. First for the jacket the pilot is wearing. That's actually very good and has me considering keeping one of the two I've got and trading off the other once I can. The second is the minifigure's face, for creating the look of an older mini with a white mustache. So it's the print details that are going to be the best with this minifigure.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,3
"Dragon_Master_48","2013-12-05T17:03:45.883Z","It's Fine Enough as is, But it Could've Been Much More","<p><b>8803-2 Pilot</b>&nbsp;is a very interesting figure, and still well made, but I feel as if it has both is pros and cons when compared to other figures, even those of the same series. I can't say I was disappointed with this figure, though: it is by no means a bad figure- just average.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Wonderful figure with well-suited colors and detailed printing.</li><li>Backpack and helmet/goggles.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No real accessories to hold.</li><li>Minifigure series is a little bit overpriced, in my opinion.</li></ul>
<p>This minifigure is better suited for people who prefer simpler minifigures than accessory-laden ones; either way, this makes a marvelous display piece, and even fits well with many sets that require a pilot. I, personally, still enjoy this figure, and despite the apparently average rating, I recommend this figure to anybody who enjoys the minifigure series or want to start collecting the series, even casually.</p>",TRUE,3,4,1,3,3
"lego7","2011-11-23T05:37:08.77Z","Review of Lego Minifigures Series 8803 Pilot Minifigure!","<p>The Pilot belongs to Series 3 of the Lego product line called Minifigures. The Pilot is very well designed. On his yellow face is a grey/white mastache and eyebrows and black eyes. He definately looks like an old&nbsp;World War 2&nbsp;pilot. Sitting on top of his head is a brown plastic avaitor helmet with grey goggles on it. He's carrying a beige bag on his backpack. His avaitor jacket is brown in colour, you can tell that minifigure designers put in effort to make the avaitor jacket realistic.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1, Well designed</li><li>Pro 2, Comes with a black stand for you to display the Pilot&nbsp;&nbsp;(Thanks Lego!) so that the minifigure will not topple over easily.</li><li>Pro 3, Well priced!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NONE!</h4>
<ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><p>   Please note that this Pilot minifigure can be&nbsp;used to replace&nbsp;the pilot in the pilot in the Lego Pharaoh's Quest&nbsp;7307 Flying Mummy Attack to make it look&nbsp;like he is fighting in a biplane in World War 1 or 2. the pilot included in the 7307 Flying Mummy Attack looks like the&nbsp;pilot here, only the body and head peice is different&nbsp;than the pilot in this Minifigures series. The pilot&nbsp;in Pharaoh's Quest does not have a backpack unlike the pilot I'm reviewing now.&nbsp;I hope this review was useful&nbsp;in your&nbsp;decision to buy this minifigure. Thanks for reading my review on the Lego Minifigures&nbsp;Series&nbsp;3 Pilot Minifigure.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,2,5
"Graysmith","2012-01-07T22:44:25.69Z","An Overlooked Gem","This guy is such an underrated beauty. I can understand why people pass him over in favour of more attention-grabbing minifigures, but they're really missing out on a very classy character. I find it hard to put into words just exactly why I love this one as much as I do, but it just feels like a perfectly executed adventurer (rather than a pilot) in the vein of Indiana Jones. Looking at him I picture him searching for Shangri-La in the snowy Himalayas or something like that. His torso looks great, as does his weathered face, and the brown/tan colours make for such a lovely combination. He may not stick out, but after I tire of the crazier minifigures, I know I'll still love this guy.",FALSE,5,4,3,4,4
"sideswinger","2020-08-10T01:47:50.73Z","one HORRENDOUS figure!","<p>So the second figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3 is the Pilot, and I really despise this dude. He was released in 2011, includes 6 pieces, and retailed for three dollars back in the day. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting him off, we have that helmet and goggles, which is made up of two parts: the helmet, and the goggles. That helmet was not a new color or anything, and it&#39;s an incredibly common piece to get, so nothing special there. The goggles are also not new, and they look fitting for him, but still not all too exciting.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which to be honest is my favorite part of the figure overall. I like those eyebrows, but the reason I like it is because it really fits for a Santa figure if you ask me, with that mustache and all. No alternate face either, which is common for most CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Next we have his backpack, which was the closest thing to an accessory we got. It was not a new piece, however it was a new color, so that&#39;s sort of neat, but nothing too extraordinary. And it isn&#39;t that special, since the 2016 backpack mould is a lot better if you ask me.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso, which has some alright printing. It fits the character, but just isn&#39;t all too exciting. He has those orange zippers and all, but still, the printing just isn&#39;t enough to save this figure. No back printing, which is to be expected since it&#39;s covered by the backpack, and since back printing just wasn&#39;t too common.</p>

<p>And since he has no accessories plus no printing on the legs, let&#39;s just jump right to my final opinion. So don&#39;t get me wrong, this figure captures a typical pilot, with the helmet and all, but my gosh, he&#39;s terribly boring. For one, we&#39;ve gotten pilots like this in LEGO before; second, he has no accessories to make up for his boring design, if you don&#39;t count the backpack; and third, he&#39;s just an overall awful figure, and he&#39;s without a doubt my least favorite in the series. And to be honest, he might be my least favorite CMF ever. Plus, the three dollar price hype worked horrendously for this dude.</p>

<p>And sorry for my rant, but I think that wraps up this review! So check out my other Series 1, 2 and 3 reviews, and hopefully this helped ya&#39;ll decide whether you should pay top dollar for it on Ebay, because I sure wouldn&#39;t; but nonetheless, thanks for reading!</p>
