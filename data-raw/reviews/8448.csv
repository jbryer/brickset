I was a little confused about how to put it together and quite frankly, still don't know if it's right, but it feels unique, so I like it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The head has light gray facial hair and a very happy smile. I might swap his head out for someone with a more generic face, since the beard covers up his unique face.</p><p><br></p><p>What I hate about this guy is the paint job. The official images Lego released are incorrect. There is no orange anywhere on the fig. It's more of a yellow, and the yellows don't match. The torso yellow is much more drab than the pants. This fact alone tempts me to trade this guy.</p><p></p>",TRUE,2,2,2,2,2

A welcome addition to any nautical themed MOC!<br>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,2
"Berrus_Brickus","2011-02-14T15:46:54.467Z","“That reminds me of the time...”","<p>I ordered a couple hand-fulls of CM from LEGO.com along with <em>Bank and Money Transport</em> and <em>Seabed Strider</em>. I wasn't hoping to get the Fisherman, and he was actually one of the only few I did not recieve multiples of (the only others were the <em>Rapper</em> and <em>Snowboarder).</em></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The Fisherman, as well as all other CM, come somewhat random in a lime green packet showing the sixteen figures posing, with the rarer ones in the front, <em>""You never know which one you'll get!""</em></p>
<p>The instructions are on a little flyer showing the basic anatomy of a minifigure and some examples of what goes where. On the other side there is a checklist of the sixteen figures. </p>
<p>I am not as happy with the Fisherman's flyer as I would be with any of the other sixteen (with the exception of the Hula Girl), as there is no indication of how to assamble the fishing pole.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p><strong>This Only Includes Non-Minifigure Parts, for minifigure parts, check the next section down.</strong></p>
<p>New sand-green fish, which is nice because I was getting tired of seeing them in silver and gunmetal.</p>
<p>A new fishing rod mold, which is nice, except I have no I idea of how to string it.</p>
<p>A new fishing line-see above</p>
<p><strong><em>For those of you who do not know, these parts are not of high quality as they are fabricated in China.</em></strong></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p><strong>Note: What I refer to as Fabu-orange, you may consider light pale orange or dark yellow</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fisherman:</strong> Fabu-orange legs, light blue torso depiction a sweater with fabu-orange cover-all top, new short white beard (great for Santa as long as the torso is not blank), a nice face with a gray beard (?) sparkling eyes, and an open mouth which actually looks nice, and an exclusive dark blue knit cap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually like the fabu-orange, as if the overalls were normal orange, his clothing would be too similar to outfits we have seen in CITY (specifically Coast-Guard, Hosiptal, and Construction Themes).&nbsp; Many have complained that&nbsp;the&nbsp;torso print and legs&nbsp;don't match, mine do.&nbsp; And from some non-official photos of the S2 Surfer, it doesn't look like every one of his figures had the printing that looks like a mistake, <em>hmm.</em></p>
<p>And F.Y.I., the same shade is used on you beloved Hazmat guy. <em>Mwhahahahaha!</em></p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Err. . . .</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>See <strong>Minifigures </strong>section </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Actually, not a bad figure.&nbsp; And that is coming from somebody who didn't want this guy in the first place.&nbsp; He is a great addition to any CITY, and perfect for me as I am planning on purchasing the new Marina but not the Harbor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And no, he is not great for playability, which is why I am not surprised that their are more copies of him than the <em>Alien </em>(who I think I'll review next) than the star of this review.</p>",TRUE,4,5,1,2,4
"Johan_V_D_","2011-03-02T05:55:12.74Z","Overrated","<p>Amateur fishermen sometimes exagerate when talking about their (near) catches... According to their stories they almost caught a whale, while in fact they only spotted a sardine. Same goes a bit for the reputation of this figure. Its highly overrated.</p><p>Probably most of the buzz is generated because its one of the rare figs in this series.</p><p>Because, apart from some pieces, this fig doesnt look as nice as on Legos promo picture at all. I guess he has been fishing in the same contaminated sea&nbsp; where the surfer has been doing his thing too. Same as with the surfer the coloring on this one is terrible.. legs and torso not matching at all.. looking very weird.<br></p><p>I realy dont understand why the quality of these figs is so inconsistant. Some are great (theme, fig finishing, accesories), some are ok (mainly because theme isnt that appealing, but well executed), and others, like this one, just seem to have bypassed quality control.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>interesting pieces: new color for the fish; beard; fishing rod (well, at least some people seem to like it..)<br></li><li><br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>terrible printing: he is supposed to wear some kind of dungarees, but the colors of the legs and the torso dont match at all, which make the overall look of the figure totally unappealing</li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>Nice to have this fig for the pieces, but, unless you want to collect all 16 of them, don't feel sorry if you missed this one. Probably you got something better for your 2€.<br></p>",TRUE,1,2,1,1,1

"Odeinoichus","2011-03-03T21:24:25.7Z","It's time to Fish","<p>Set #8803 Fisherman: Many fans of the LEGO Mini-Figure have felt this is one of the better offerings from the series due to a few key factors, first of all it introduces a new style of LEGO beard, it features a brand new LEGO fishing rod and overall it's just that impressive looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally can't say one way or the other just how impressed I am by this Mini-Figure. Sure he's got all of what I said above and more, but at the end of the day he's just an everyday Elderly Fisherman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His torso print evokes overalls and a sweater, something new for all you Mini-Figure lovers. His fishing rod is a new piece and works slightly better as a fishing rod than the original piece available in older Town sets. His blue tuque is a great new style of hat and his beard is a nice change from the old Castle Wizard's beard that has been used quite often in LEGO sets for elderly gentlemen. He also includes a light green toned fish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say it's a nice new Mini-Figure although I question the inclusion of a grey beard on the facial print. He's going to fit in great with the new LEGO City Harbour.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4
"AETerry","2011-03-30T17:57:17.34Z","Fisherman Review","<p>I think the word I want for this minifigure is Ambevilent. I'm not sure what LEGO had in mind with the design of this mini. What it has going for it is the introduction of a new style Lego Fishing poles. There had been one other and that was way back in the 80's with Fabuland... if you got the Cat Minifigure pack. As for this new accessory, I do hope to see more of them come out and in other sets to make use of them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other feature going for this minifigure is the new style of beard for creating the look of an old minifigure. The print job of the minifigure for the torso with the legs is uneven and therefore unconvincing for me. The beanie cap I've seen with the Thief Characters being used in the new 2011 City Police sets. And the fish is a different color from the previous silver colors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beard and fishing pole make this minifigure worth getting.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,4
"StarKiller22515","2020-02-09T18:58:24.66Z","The BIG Catch","<p>This is a very cool, unique figure if you ask me. The new smaller fishing rod piece is nice, but the fishing line falls off a little too easily. The beard is perfect for a Santa mini figure. The navy beanie is nice and the orange wetsuit overalls thing is great for someone from a deep sea vessel. The sand green fish is nice as well as it is a nice change from the normal silver one. Only $2.99 for a great mini figure like this is a steal compared to the prices today.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-08-09T01:58:48.67Z","A fantastic figure!","<p>So the Fisherman was the first figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3, and he is a great figure, considering he&#39;s in an awful series. He was released in 2011, includes 8 pieces, and retailed for three bucks, which was a dollar up from the original price. Nonetheless, let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>So on top we have that hat piece, which was a new color for it. And it&#39;s caste in that dark blue-green color, so that&#39;s pretty neat. Nowadays it&#39;s not rare or anything since it&#39;s come in lots of sets since 2011, but it is still pretty cool since it was exclusive back in the day.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which has some great printing on it. I like the gray beard printing, but the best bit is the huge grin. He just looks so chipper and glad, and I really&nbsp;love that. No alternate face since it would look really awkward with that exposed back.</p>

<p>And next we have that beard, which is totally the best part of the figure. It was new for the figure, which makes it even cooler, and I just love how the piece came out. It&#39;s been used in lots of sets, like Series 8, some Nexo Knights, Series 20, just lots of nice sets. And it is, of course, very fitting for Santa Claus. It is caste in white too, so that&#39;s even cooler. It&#39;s made of rubber as well, which is fine with me.</p>

<p>And then we have his torso, which has some good printing. I love how he has those orange overalls and all, but I must admit, it looks like the wrong color next to those legs. Nonetheless, it&#39;s some okay printing. No alternate printing, which if you ask me, a three dollar figure really needs that, but oh well. Is what it is I guess.</p>

<p>But then we have his legs, which are caste in orange. And they were new for the figure too in that color, so that&#39;s cool. No printing on them, but that&#39;s okay. And like I said, the color doesn&#39;t really match the color of that printing on the torso. Still, it&#39;a cool that it&#39;s exclusive.</p>

<p>And finally we have his accessories. He technically has two, but that pole is made of two pieces. And speaking of which, that fishing pole is a great build. And I think it was new for the figure, but I might be wrong. Either way, the pole piece itself looks great, with the studs on both sides, and it&#39;s caste in black too. Then the string piece looks great too, with that bar at the tip and the stud on the other end. Just a great build overall. Then he also comes with that fish, which now is not too special, but back then it was a new color for it, that being sand green.</p>

<p>And my overall opinion is that this is a brilliant figure. I just really love how he came out as a whole. He has incredible accessories, all three of which I think were new, we have that new hat color, and best of all, that beard piece. This is just an overall fantastic figure, and while this series isn&#39;t that great overall, I think this is one of the best in the series, for his value and his looks. And I think that wraps up this review! So don&#39;t forget to check out my other Series 1 and 2 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
