"HeroFactoryDude316","2010-12-19T14:51:46.23Z","Cyborg Attack!","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently got this guy at TRU yesterday. Along with him I got the gorilla guy, the rapper, race car driver, and tribal chief. Any way..... on with the review. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Building experience:</b> The Space Villain has a simple build like most minifigs. However there is more building involved with him because of his arm and weapon. I give him a 4/5.</p>
<p><b>Parts:</b> This guy has awesome parts! First he comes with an awesome gun. I really needed that lightsaber piece. He also has a robotic leg (silver unlike the one from the pirate theme). Anther cool thing is his robot arm. I give him a 5/5.</p>
<p><b>Playability: </b>There's not much playability unless you have other Minifigs or the Star wars theme in my opinion. I give a 3/5</p>
<p><b>Money value</b>: I don't know if it's because their not supposed to come out until January or what but $ 3.99 is expensive for minifigs. Even with great parts it just doesn't make sense. I give 3/5.</p>
<p><b>Overall: </b>Overall it's a great minifig to anyone's collection. The only things are the price and the fact that you can't really tell if you got this guy or not. Just do what I did and grab a few of them and hope for the best. Overall I say a 4/5.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,3

"BrickManBrick","2011-01-09T12:31:18.59Z","Great Parts, Great Minifigure!","<p>Great Minifigure! I used the decoder to get him. i then felt out the pack. For those who would like to purchase a Cyborg, Feel for the really big helmet, and the visor. To make sure, then feel for the red light saber. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts</p>
<p>This minifigure comes with great parts. You get the robot arm, which is pretty rare. He also comes with a nice big helmet which is not very common. Finally, he comes with a peg leg, which is not very common eithier. Great parts for collecters.</p>
<p>Minifigure</p>
<p>This guy is very unique. He has a little gun with the red lightsaber blade, and a very neat little gun. His head reminds me of terminator,you can use that head for a custom terminator. He has a great torso, it's very detailed. Great robot arm, it really cool. And finally, the peg leg which is awesome.</p>
<p>Rap - Up!</p>
<p>This is honestly one of the most unique and awesome minifig from Series 3. I recomend getting him. Read the top and find out my method on getting him!</p>

"Doctor_Leg_O_Brick","2011-02-26T06:22:56.237Z","We can rebuild him....","<p>Well, its been five months or so since&nbsp;I did my last review, and&nbsp;I was thinking about doing a review of this guy. As as a space fan, but don't have that many space sets (untill this summer...)&nbsp;I wanted this thing to have to not only attack my city, but also to attack my series one Spaceman. Think of the things them two could do! I, myself, have said that the blacktron cyborg has gone back into the past after the spaceman (read the Spaceman's profile on lego.com), but you can do what you like with this guy. I think reading this back over that i have watched two many Terminator movies....Anyway, i will stop writing the intro and start writing my review! (sorry for such a long intro)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE BUILD</p>
<p>Well,&nbsp;I think anyone could do this in the age range on the packet,&nbsp;as all you have to do is put six parts together. I think it taken about six/seven seconds to build, the only problem a five year old might have is putting&nbsp;the visor in the helmet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PARTS/MINFIGURES</p>
<p>Has this guy been into many firefights with M-Tron and the Space Police or what! He has the same helmet as SP3 (space police three) just in black, or the Spaceman from series one, the Spaceman from the city set 3367, new ADU from Alien Conquest and some of the World racers sets in black. His torso show nicely his Blacktron logo and some armor/wires and a belt. His arm (the robot one) is in a nice new shade of black. Sorry if i am wrong about that but I have never had&nbsp;this colour before. His other arm is a normal lego minifigure arm, so no&nbsp;special part there. However, his legs&nbsp;are nice. He has a pirates peg leg recoloured in the new black, and a normal lego minifigure leg and hip. His head is the crown of the&nbsp;minifigure. That ""I'm going to blow your head off"" look is realy affective&nbsp;and&nbsp;what a difference from the smiley heads of the old Blacktron series. His head is like the Terminator's so if you want a head for your Terminator, you know where to get it. The gun is a recolour of the&nbsp;Series one Spaceman and the Series three Alien, which has a short lightsaber piece&nbsp;in red for this figure insted of blue or purple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PLAYABILITY</p>
<p>Very low without any other lego minifigures to blow away and terrorise. But on the other hand, this guy can go anywhere in your collection (well not Belville or Duplo or quatro)!Just think, your castle colletion can be attacked by ""A Warlock who has limbs made of steel and motorized energy from a strange weapon made by the devil himself that can defeat a army of 10,000!"" Or your city can be attacked by ""A strange, lego figure from space that even N.A.S.A are having trouble figureing out who....or what.....it is"". The things you can do are endless with this Blackron maniac.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OVERALL RATING</p>
<p>Get this figure otherwise you will be dissapointed not to have him around. Also, yes this guy is made of plastic from china, and yes this gos against legos ""Only the best is good enough"" but&nbsp;I have never had a problem with any figure from any of the series.</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2011-03-03T20:55:17Z","Space Villain or Cyborg, which is it?","<p>Set #8803 Space Villain: The Space Villain is a mighty fun looking Mini-Figure, he is obviously a cyborg with nods to the old Blacktron sub-theme of Space. Specifically the Blacktron 2 Sub-Theme, due to the fact that they are the ones with the B symbol on their chests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chest print is a great looking print, as mentioned it features the Blacktron 2 symbol on the collar of what might be some sort of cyborg controlling chest panel or space suit thing. His legs are the standard Pirates peg-leg pair of legs in two shades of black, the peg-leg side is a different color of black. (At least I believe it to be more black than any type of grey coloring.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also has a robotic arm with the standard robot hand, unfortunately despite what the pictures say it doesn't push all the way into the arm. Accessory wise he has the space pistol with a red lightsaber blade as an energy beam. He also has a bulky looking helmet, again sort of homaging the character of Darth Vader, or perhaps Dark Helmet from Spaceballs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His facial print is partly covered by a metalic plate of some kind that covers one eye with a red glowing optic sensor, his teeth are in a gritting pose his other eye looks very angry, he obviously doesn't like being a cyborg, but again who would?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this Mini-Figure is a great nod to classic late 80's Space sets and is an excellent addition to your current Space collection. He's just an all around great Mini-Figure and worthy of being tracked down.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-02-08T16:55:09.043Z","No one is safe when the Space Villain is around...","Series 3 brought us this retired Blacktron warrior, who&nbsp;unfortunately&nbsp;for him has lost part of his body- his peg leg and robot arm remind him of this, as well as his robot eye. He's still ready to fight though, which is shown by his blaster. I quite liked this minifigure- was it his metal peg leg, his robot arm, or his Halo like helmet? I'm not sure. But maybe it's that this figure is just quite cool. LEGO should be proud of their marvelous combination of minifigure parts!",FALSE,5,3,1,3,4
"alva","2011-04-08T09:24:17.07Z","Worst Minifig in Minifig 3 Collection","I am a big lover of Blacktron 2. I think they are the best theme that Lego ever launched. But i think to put the Blacktron 2 logo in this minifig is really a disgrace. I hate the way of the minifig look. Come on, you can build a cyborg, but you could not build a cyborg leg, only a peg leg like a pirate hundred years ago? If Lego want to create a feeling of a cyborg, I think a leg with silver color will serve this minifig better.<br><br>I also do not like the color. I think the original Blacktron 2 color (with white as dominant torso and leg color) will serve the minifig better.<br><br>The only reason I bought the minifig is just to make my collection complete.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-08T09:37:26.07Z","LEGO Collectable Minifigures (Series 3) - Space Villain Review","This minifig is one of the BEST figures of series 2 so far. I like the space sets like this one. The robot arm has been used on some LEGO Agents minifigs before and the pirate leg has a gray color which is really nice. The gun has been taken from the LEGO Space (Alien Conquest) theme and the helmet design has been taken from the LEGO Space (Space Police III) theme. When I compared the laser of the gun with the lightsaber blade I noticed that the Collectable Minifigure version is a little bit shorter than the Star Wars version. And if you look closer you'll realize the old LEGO Space (Blacktron) logo on his torso. When I saw the Blacktron logos on this minifig and on a figure we got in the Space Police III theme I thought that LEGO is going to bring back Blacktron but then they gave us Alien Conquest (which isn't a bad them either) which really surprised me a lot.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,5
"AETerry","2011-03-29T13:50:45.153Z","Space Villian Review","<p>I'm still not very sure about this minifigure. He almost looks worse in person then when I had only a picture of the minigure to look at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, if you're a fan of Blacktron or remember them, he's a clear nods towards them with the stylized ""B"" symbol on his chest that's a clear indicator of Blacktron 2. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dark iron grey peg leg ruins the effect of a cyborg villian for me. It's too over the top for me. The arm though is alright. As for as his laser pistol accessory goes. Remove the clear red rod and it looks better. I don't care for the style of helmet he's got. Head piece is alright, clearly marking him as a cybord and if you look carefully, you can see his teeth appear to be metal too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps in a campy sort of way this minifigure works. There's just certain features of this minifigure I don't like and others that I do, so it gives me mixed feelings.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,3
"AlHazred","2011-08-29T12:14:14.637Z","Blacktron II Lives Again!","<p>I was excited to hear about a cyborg in Series 3, but thought I'd be disappointed based on the tiny image on the box. When I finally got the minifigure, I was pleasantly surprised.&nbsp;</p><p>The minifigure comes with black legs with a peg-leg post for the right leg, a black torso with a replaceable socket for the right arm, a scarred face with a bionic right eye, and a black helmet with a golden visor. I'm a little unhappy with the peg-leg; I realize there are limited options for variation on the minifigure legs while still maintaining modularity with all other LEGO products, but they might have included some sort of socket feature. I love the ""mech arm"", which was used in the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7066-1"">Agents</a> theme and also shows up on <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=ac012"">the alien cyborg</a> in the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7066-1"">Alien Conquest Earth Defense HQ</a> set. This CMF pack comes with a black claw for the Space Villain, but you could easily slot in any of a dozen other LEGO parts; this gives good value for the money, in my opinion.</p><p>In addition, the torso has a green ""B"" Blacktron II-style logo on the pocket of silver uniform! What a great nod to a well-loved Classic Space subtheme! I'd love to get a whole slew of Space Villains for customizing a bunch of ""new Blacktron"" minifigures! The only way it could have been even better is if they had put the logo on the pocket of one of the Blacktron I all-black torsos.</p><p>As far as accessories go, you have a gunmetal ray gun; like the one with the Space Alien, it's a classic 50's-style retro piece, beautiful in its simplicity. I'm not insanely fond of the trans-red ""lightsaber blade"" they use to show it firing, but at least the SW enthusiasts will have a reason to buy.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Mech arm - customize your own cyborg!<br></li><li>Blacktron II logo - for your ""new Blacktron"" space villains!<br></li><li>Retro ray gun, since you just can't have enough</li><li>Black helmet with gold visor is a nice touch, and would look good on other minifigures<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Peg-leg detracts from the high-tech look<br></li></ul>
<p>All told, I'm not surprised with how popular the Space Villain turned out to be; I see individual figures selling for a lot more than USD 2.99 on Bricklink. I wouldn't mind buying or trading for a bunch of these to make a ""new Blacktron"" squad with which to bedevil my Space Police III guys. The only real minus is the peg-leg, but I find myself growing used to it with time.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,5
"sideswinger","2020-08-14T02:39:50.517Z","One INTERESTING figure!","<p>So the sixth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3 is the Space Villain, and I do have a lot to say about this dude. He was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes eight pieces, not counting the display stand, which for some reason I don&#39;t count. I mean if you&#39;ve read my other reviews, you know that I&#39;ve NEVER included the stand in the piece count. I really don&#39;t know why. But anyway, let&#39;s get a closer look at this figure!</p>

<p>So on top we have that helmet, which is of course, two parts. It has the black base, which is the Series 1 Spaceman helmet, except here it&#39;s caste in black, which I think was a new color for the figure. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything special nowadays, but it was back then. I like the moulding at the back as well. But things get a bit interesting with that visor, which is caste in a transparent yellow. And I think that&#39;s a kind of rare color for that part, so that&#39;s cool.</p>

<p>And under the helmet&nbsp;we have his face, which has some pretty good printing on it. I love the cyborg half, with that robotic red eye, and his evil snarl looks good as well. I do have one little nitpick though, which is that the robot-side looks a bit odd. You see, the silver printing doesn&#39;t carry around his head, and that looks pretty strange. I don&#39;t expect it one bit, since side head printing is extremely rare with LEGO, but still, the fact that it looks strange cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, which is where things very interesting. First off, he has that robot arm instead of a traditional LEGO Minifigure arm, so that&#39;s pretty cool. It wasn&#39;t new, as it was introduced with the Series 1 Robot, but this was a new color for it; that being a very dark gray color. And since the hand&nbsp;is that claw piece, it is separate from the arm itself. The other arm isn&#39;t anything special. But then we have his torso, which is even more interesting. See that green &quot;B&quot; on his chest? Well that&#39;s a LEGO Blacktron logo, which was a theme that ran from 1987 to 1993. I love when LEGO has easter eggs in their merchandise, and we see that here. No alternate back printing, which is unfortunate, but oh well.</p>

<p>And adding to the craziness is his legs, which is where things are also interesting. As you can very well see, one of his legs is just plain black. But the other is that peg leg piece, which is caste in that silvery gray color. I might be mistaken, but I think this was a new color for it back in the day. I must admit,I&#39;m having trouble grasping why he has a peg leg, but I guess because he&#39;s a cyborg guy. And it&#39;s a new color for it, so who cares!</p>

<p>And as if the figure couldn&#39;t get any more interesting, we have his accessory, which is made of two parts: the gun, and the rod. Now yes, it is just a ray gun. And yes, it is an extremely overused accessory in the CMF world. But this was a new color for&nbsp;it back in the day, that being the same dark gray color the robot arm is caste in. I kind of wish the rod was yellow rather than red, because I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever got a trans-yellow rod. And if we have, it&#39;s been in very little sets.</p>

<p>And at last, it&#39;s time for my final verdict. Honestly, I&#39;m kind of broke with this guy. On one hand, I sort of think his design is a little boring, however &quot;interesting&quot; he may be, and his choice is a bit niche. Plus, the only thing that makes him interesting is the pieces. Then on the other hand, I sort of like this dude berceuse he does have so many good pieces, like the helmet, torso, arm, leg, gun, lots of pieces. Another reason I like him is because, like I said, I love when LEGO includes easter eggs, and this guy has two. I already covered the Blacktron logo, but this entire character is an easter egg in and of himself. And that&#39;s because he&#39;s supposed to be an alter ego of the Series 1 Spaceman. I just love that. So that&#39;s why I&#39;ve given this dude an overall score of four. Good value, and good pieces.</p>

<p>And I think that&#39;s it for this review! So check out my Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
