"CamberbrickGreen","2013-12-15T05:13:10.243Z","Surreal & Rewarding","Of the Building Ideas Books, I never fancied this one much having seen those that followed but when you only have basic bricks at your disposal and forget that you can not necessarily make the intricate wonders in future publications, this is equally if not more rewarding. The front cover contains some exciting images and loads of early 1980's blockiness so lets take a look inside...<div><br></div><div><b>Duplo</b></div><div>The youngsters get a bash at monkey see, monkey do with some melding of basic bricks from Lego stuffed on top of the giant Duplo blocks. The results are as you might expect and make a nice introduction to combining those monstrous blocks which would incidentally make some great large builds in Lego scale if you need a temple wall etc. Clunky vehicles and animals appear followed by an array of dead clown friends from the past, all remembered in the melancholy of a wax crayon drawn dream cloud above a giant clown face with house windows for eyes. Disturbed? Interpretation is obviously essential here but even as a kid some of the weirdness was just lost on me and I did not know what I was looking at.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The standard Lego Town trees look strange next to a grinning Duplo kid and his house and the animals are frequently freakish or bizarre which is of course great for small children to have fun with. One oddity I liked was the snail with a house window in the shell.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Basic</b></div><div>Unusual buses, trucks and vans feature with giant wheels on blocks. They are driven by a range of folk that I can not for the life of me remember well but could be described as between a Duplo figure and a Minifigure. The wax crayon is back to draw road lines which was a nice suggestion for those of us who could not afford or find those elusive road plates. More of these Basic folk show up in houses, buildings, aerplanes, boats, bedrooms and 'crazy' house-cars which for me always indicated an imaginative kid lacking bricks at a loose end, unable to realise their potential.</div><div><br></div><div>At least the mini vehicle traffic scene provides a solution to killing off all those excess wheels. Here some really nice vehicle builds make some good ideas; fire engines, trucks, wagons, caravans, trains, all giving solid model inspiration. Things get a bit more serious here with a large fire engine and excellent sports car and then suddenly we are back to a delightfully bonkers set of gypsies with a horse drawn caravan and sheep!&nbsp;</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Town: Vehicles</b></div><div>Finally minifigures arrive with dragsters on a racing track and a chunky F1 car to build. I should add that technic wheels are used whenever the designers feel like it which is a little unfair as they look great but were rarely used in Town sets as shown blended here. Perhaps we needed to buy a Technic set for this but the basic stuff is still fun including a man who's head is stuck atop a tiny F1 car. The wind up motor makes an appearance along with increasingly large and chunky models such as a crane. Some of the traffic on a small strip sadly diminished to the bottom of the page include some huge and wonderful looking vehicles. The main focus however continues with builds for a farm, sheep being a quick and easy build.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Space</b></div><div>A very large blue space vehicle then comes along with some not particularly easy to find parts. It should though please fans of blue Space sets. This is the briefest section and features just this one build.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Town: Construction</b></div><div>Things take off here with a superb scene of a busy construction and in my opinion the best build instructions of the book for a quarry heavy hauler or mining truck if you want. The cumbersome vehicles in the back ground are not made anything of though.</div><div><br></div><div>Here the sections follow no more pattern and jump back to sheep and then a zoo and other animals. The zoo provides a brilliant range of simple but rewarding builds for all ages of child and despite a brief Noah's Ark scene (you probably won't see Lego depict that again) the path returns to penguins, one of the most fun and quick animal builds, and a circus.</div><div><br></div><div>Town houses are depicted in simplicity for easy builds and then in more advanced ways for kids with loads of roof sections where the really great houses get made. Loads of building types are gone through by image rather than instruction which is more inspiration as the book range suggests - 'Building Ideas' not 'Building Instructions'. But that factory is pretty amazing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The buildings with vehicles even reach Thunderbird level in style but going off on a tangent which the book frequently does we arrive in playgrounds, giant interiors with poshly dressed minifigures with added on bricks that is not really shown anymore- giant dresses, coat tails and shoes! These interiors continue until&nbsp;all is at sea. Boats being an ongoing section.&nbsp;Building as a theme is next with its house constructing crane that leads to a mega-crane of impressive yet mostly unachievable proportions.</div><div><br></div><div>Here the surreality of the book goes up a notch with humanoid animals that could not be further from Chima although is Chima not weird? Clown, red indian (yes red) and robot madness comes next. All very good but the mini build vehicles are a simple but welcome relief. Chunky airport and flight models are also very enjoyable normality and decent models.</div><div><br></div><div>Why it should all end on a complex cable car house and ski ramp is beyond me but while pickled, the ideas in this book are on the whole very goo and make a unique old Lego ideas book for many to enjoy. Perhaps finding past parts that are less used now may be a problem but the inspiration her counts for a decent read.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,3,1,3,1,3
"medleyj","2020-04-30T19:52:49.823Z","GREAT idea book with tons of simple ideas for all types of themes","<p>If you want a book that covers building animals, city, farming, boats, jets, technic, or other simple or advanced models, this is the book for you. Lots of parts are 1970-1980 style and many are discontinued. The snow skiing ski slope ideas are great. This was my first idea book and I wore it out as a kid so much, I had to buy another as an adult.&nbsp;</p>

"michaels_afol","2021-01-16T14:39:12.72Z","A return to the standard format for Lego Ideas Books","<p>The beginning of the 1980&#39;s was a big time for Lego Ideas Books, with the release of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6000-1/LEGOLAND-Idea-Book"">6000</a> in 1980 and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7777-1/Trains-Ideas-Book"">7777</a> in 1981.&nbsp;226 was also released in 1981, although it tends to get overlooked in the shadow&nbsp;of those two aforementioned&nbsp;iconic giants.&nbsp;6000 incorporated&nbsp;a story throughout it&#39;s pages, and 7777 also threaded its builds together with a minifig on a handcart passing by each build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>226 was something of a reset back to the more usual Ideas Book format, with just a parade of various random Lego building ideas. At most some were grouped by sub-theme, such as houses, boats or aircraft.</p>

<p>226 did still&nbsp;have an overarching theme, but it was not as obvious as 6000 (Town, Space and Castle) or 7777 (Trains).&nbsp;The builds in 226 were based on the universal/basic building sets (the equivalent to today&#39;s Classic theme) released in 1980 to 1981. These sets were in three groupings aimed at different ages. 3xx for ages 3-4, 5xx for ages 5-6, and 7xx for ages 7 and up.</p>

<p>After a couple of pages showing how to combine Duplo and System bricks, the next&nbsp;few pages of the book are devoted to building ideas based on the 3xx sets, including the &ldquo;finger puppet&rdquo; figures that came in these sets.</p>

<p>Then the remainder of the book is devoted to builds based on the 5xx and 7xx sets. Builds based on the 5xx sets are very bright and colourful and are more simple (for the time), with the 7xx style builds being a bit more complex. Each of the 7xx sets had a distinct colour palette so it&#39;s easy to spot which set the build would be based on, but mostly the builds use&nbsp;extra parts that were not in the sets.&nbsp;But as stated in the introductory paragraph in multiple languages at the front of the book, the aim of the book is to provide inspiration to children to build new things with the bricks they have, not necessarily just copy the builds in the book.</p>

<p>Some highlights from the book include a Noah&#39;s Ark scene, a racetrack (including the now rare Cyprus trees and several uses of the also rare 3 &times; 4 33 degree slope in trans-clear), a micro scale harbour, a large factory, a retro futuristic house, a construction site, doll&#39;s house furniture, a hot air balloon and a snow scene with minfig skiers and a cable car set into a foam mountain. Some builds are populated by minfigs, some are not.</p>

<p>The quality of the building ideas do vary, but this book is aimed at a fairly broad age range, so that is to be expected with such a wide brief.</p>

<p>While at Brickvention in 2020 I was talking to a boy who was probably around 10&nbsp;years old. He described an old ideas book that belonged to his parents&nbsp;and I knew straight away from his description it was 226. He told me how he was recreating builds from the book, adapting them to the modern parts he had. Nearly forty years on&nbsp;226 was still doing exactly what it was designed to do, inspiring young builders.&nbsp;</p>
