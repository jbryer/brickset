"gime","2011-01-16T20:13:56.283Z","really great","<p>It was not on top of my wish-list but I'm happy that I got it. Where I live, the price is at the same level as the S1 and S2 [~ $2.4].</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Standard S3 green bag and a standard folded instruction. No barcode and dots/bumps are not reliable.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The snowboard is just great. Goggles are fine too. Quality is very good but there are no spare parts.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>That is some pretty girl. I like the fact that it is a female character this time. You can pair her up with the skier from S2 and you'll get a perfect couple.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Cannot be simplier.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Looks great, it's really catchy.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I like it and I recommend it to all minifig collectors. Though I believe this might be one of those underrated characters in the series.</p><p>[img]http://gime.vot.pl/gime/8803_snowboarderer.jpg[/img]</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"qitah","2011-02-14T05:21:38.77Z","Halfpipe Harriet (or so i've christened her)","This was one of the must have figures for me from series 3 - everything about her is perfect. For a start, you get a kick-arse female figure, rather than the usual boring sterotypes of baywatch babe, cheerleader or maraca shaking island girl. Plus the colour scheme is great - the pink, gray and white look really sporty and classy on her, especially contrasted against the amazing dark blue snowboard!&nbsp; I've never seen a pink helmet before either, that's a plus.<br><br>Might be just me, but i think the quality of the plastic on her is better than average for the collectables as well. Legs are stiffer and nothing looks transparent.<br>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,3
"Odeinoichus","2011-03-03T16:19:09.603Z","Zipping down the Slopes","<p>Set #8803 Snowboarder: As Mini-Figures go the Snowboarder is one of the better figures from the Collectible Mini-Figures collection. She has a fairly detailed print, with zippers for pockets and some lavender color which evokes a snowsuit one would see snowboarders wearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her hands consist of grey color for gloves and her face print is a happy smiling expression showing off her teeth. She is having loads of fun while out and about on the mountains. Her helmet is a uniquely colored piece of a lavender like tone and it includes a pair of those white goggle pieces we Star Wars fans have long asociated with Hoth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The snowboard accessory is a great new piece from LEGO, it is a dark blue with blue and lavender snowflakes printed on the surface. I really wanted this figure and am super glad I got her, my one dissapointment is that unlike the Racecar Driver she doesn't come with a spare hairpiece to use for when she wants to take her helmet off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this Mini-Figure is one of the better figures from Series 3 and you should definitely try to find one or even two for your collection.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4
"sideswinger","2020-08-13T16:24:22.947Z","A decent figure.","<p>So the Snowboarder is the fifth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3, and she&#39;s an okay figure. She was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces, if you don&#39;t count the display stand, which I never do. But let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>So on top we have that helmet, which is made up of two pieces: the pink base, and the white goggles. And the helmet isn&#39;t anything super special, although I personally don&#39;t see that color for the helmet in much sets. In fact, the color might even be exclusive, though I don&#39;t think it is. The white goggles aren&#39;t anything to great either, though it is some nice part usage, as they were first used for&nbsp;the Star Wars Stormtroopers.</p>

<p>Next we have that face printing, which is pretty cool if you ask me. I always like when LEGO gives us casual generic faces, as they are very useful in Custom figures. This figure has no alternate expression, but that&#39;s normal for lots of CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Next we have her torso, which has some good printing. I love the white and pink color scheme, which looks really good together. Also sort of interesting how her hands are gray, to represent gloves. No back printing, which is normal for these older CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Then we have her legs, which have a little printing on them, to where she has some black boots and some zippers. Not too much going on there, but it is pretty cool how they printed them at all.</p>

<p>And finally, we have her snowboard, which is the best part of the figure. And I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t know if the part was new for the figure or not. I&#39;m terrible at knowing what parts are new and whatnot. But what I do know is that it has some decent printing on it, with the snowflakes in pink and blue. I also like the color it&#39;s caste in, which is that dark blue, so all cool there.</p>

<p>And overall, while this is a pretty bland series as a whole, I think this exact figure isn&#39;t all too bad. I mean sure, she isn&#39;t anything over the top, but she&#39;s decent. My favorite part is of course, her snowboard, with that printing and all. And I do think three dollars is a tad much, but not that big of a deal. And from my research, she goes for about thirteen to sixteen bucks on Ebay, which is a bit too much for her, but oh well. And I think that wraps up this review! So check out my Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>

"AlkkuV","2022-02-05T14:06:49.68Z","Snowboarder.","<p>Hello guys, it&#39;s AlkkuV, back with another review. Next up in series 3 is the Snowboarder. I tried to do these in the order of the booklet, but I already did the Baseball Player, so it doesn&#39;t&nbsp;matter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: You already know the deal, just a basic series 3 bag and booklet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure: So, the Snowboarder. First of all things, she is a female minifigure, which is very good. She comes with a snowboard, of course, but it has some nice printing on it. She come with a pink helmet with a white visor. The printing on the torso is good, but again, the is almost no printing on the legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: The set comes with seven parts. The helmet and the visor are the only ones that are not unique I think, but I could be wrong about the helmet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: Again, just put the mini-fig together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete Build: Overall I think this is in the middle of boring and exciting, so it&#39;s not the best, but not the worst. Overall I would give this set a 4.7/5.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and stay toon for more reviews!</p>
