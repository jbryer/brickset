"CapnRex101","2011-01-02T13:52:02.15Z","8803 (8) - Race Car Driver","<p>While I like the Collectable Minifigures as a series, sometimes the figures which do not include a brand new mould, seem poor in comparison to the ones which do. Unfortunately, I suspect that is what has happened here.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are few interesting parts in this set, which is a shame. There is some new printing, but that is it.</p><p>The crash helmet is a decent piece, it is printed with a&nbsp;chequered circle around the top of the helmet and an Octan symbol adorns that. The visor can move up and down like on a real helmet.</p><p>One nice touch is the inclusion of a blonde hairpiece, it is the same piece as made its&nbsp;d√©but&nbsp;on Mutt Williams, and since then has really been overused. However as far as I am aware this is its first appearance in blonde, which is nice.</p><p>The face has some detail, it has brown eyebrows (which do not match the hair) and a wide grin, maybe he just won a race?</p><p>The torso is the highlight of the Minifigure, some of the detailing is really excellent. It is predominantly red but contains some white. All over it has white&nbsp;stitches&nbsp;and motifs, one is a spanner with a flame coming out of the end and the other I cannot read. A white band goes across the middle of the torso, on which it says Octan. One detail I like is the belt, it is red and white and says on it 'N. Groves' which I imagine is the name of the driver. His arms are red and he is wearing white gloves.</p><p>The legs are just plain red and he has white hips.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The saving graces for this figure are the cheap price (as with all of the Collectable Minifigures) and the good&nbsp;playability, this figure would go well with any of the racers sets and you could create a really exciting race. I want to give all of the Collectable Minifigures good marks, but sadly this figure simply doesn't warrant a particularly decent score.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 5/10</p>",TRUE,3,2,3,4,5
"Lego_Minifig_Man","2011-02-06T13:35:54.97Z","I think Octan sponsors ALL the sporting events in Lego City!!","I wasn't planning on buying any lego collectible minifigures on the day I bought this guy. I was at a local bookstore, and was caught by surprise that they were selling these. I was really excited, and scared that they'd be all gone if I waited, so I 'blindly' picked out one. I'm not too dissapointed, as this would've been my third choice if I did have the crib sheet, but I was still hoping for either the samurai, or the gorilla suit man. I'm planning on going back with the crib sheet soon. Tip for people who feel the bags to tell about the contents: the helmets for this guy and the snowboarder feel similar to the ape guy's mask. Anyways, on to the review!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Accessories<br/>This guy comes with a helmet, and the standard stand. It would've been nice if they had included somthing else with him. Maybe a trophy? Yeah, that would've been good. They could have used the trophy from the new Harry Potter Quidditch set.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Anyways, he has a helmet. It's red, with a circle that is made up from a checkered pattern, like from a racing flag, on the top. It also includes a Octan symbol on the front. It also have a clear, detachable,&nbsp;visor. You can't put the helmet on while he has his hair peice on, which is okay with me, but would probably be a small problem if you intend to make a stop-motion video featuring him.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>He also has a hair peice, which is blond, and is a very good length. It's the first time (as far as I know) that that hair peice came in blond.&nbsp;It's the same hair peice as many other recent minifigures, including the minifig that came with the sports car set. This is one of the key elements in this figure that made me want it, because I have similar hair and I'd like to make a minifigure of myself.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>It also features a normal minifig stand. Black, flat, 3x4 with only four studs&nbsp;in a line on top. It's fine, and nothing special.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Head<br/>&nbsp;<br/>His head is a very simple, but nice, expression. A big grin, with eyes that aren't just circles, and some brown eyebrows. He must've won!&nbsp;Might be awkward if he didn't win. Interestingly, the eyebrows are black in the pictures. Overall, I really like it. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Torso<br/>&nbsp;<br/>He is wearing a red racing suit with a belt-type-thing that says N. Groves on it, and it features some&nbsp;logos from fictional companies. He has red arms with white gloves on. He doesn't have a printed back, which is dissapointing, because it would've been a great place for some more logos. Strangely, his left hand took a lot of force to turn. Is that&nbsp;going on with everybody's?<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Legs<br/>&nbsp;<br/>His&nbsp;lower-peice has red legs, and a white... peice thing. It's fine, and I really don't have much to say about it.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Playability<br/>&nbsp;<br/>He has some playability, but you have to have a racecar for him. And lego racecars aren't really all THAT common, and I don't have one, so I'm giving him a low playability. There should've been a double-printed head, with the other side a sad face because he's look strange grinning if another person won. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Conclusion<br/>I gave it a low building experience because it wasn't special, but it wasn't bad or hard. Truthfully, I don't know how I&nbsp;should&nbsp;rate things on that, like,&nbsp;how fun was it, or did you have troubles buliding it, or... you know? Anyways,&nbsp;this is my third favourite minifigure from Series 3, mainly because of the hair peice, and partly because my friend who watches F1 racing calls him Micheal Schumacher. If you have a lego racecar, you should buy it. If you don't, you should skip it.",TRUE,3,2,1,2,3

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Color choice and constrating, this minifigure is pretty good with the red and white and the printing on his torso for Octan is very on par with everything else seen in the Collectible Minifigures line, even some of the standard sets such as Pharoah's Quest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those collecting the minifigures to complete sets, this figure is an obvious must, for those just collecting a few figures, he's not bad and worth considering having around, especially if you've got a lot of other Race Car themed sets, either from the 80-90's where Shell was the sponser of choice to the current World Racers theme.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2011-03-02T13:28:38.503Z","Driving Car Number 53 is Jim Douglas!","<p>Set #8803 Racecar Driver: Ok, so he looks nothing like Dean Jones from the Lovebug, but the title of this review is designed to catch your eye. The racecar driver seems to be one of those Mini-Figures from Series 3 that isn't as aweinspiring as some of the other figures in the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, he is still a worthy new Mini-Figure to your collection, and on the plus side I've got a Third Place driver for my World Racers Snake Canyon display stand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The print on this Mini-Figure is highly nostalgic, he reminds me of the racers from the early 90's which often used Octan as their sponsors. This guy is a bit more detailed however with extra writing on his torso, and his facial expression is quite cheery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I especially like the blond hair included with him as it allows for him to remove his helmet and have something underneath, as opposed to going bald or constantly having to wear his helmet while walking through LEGO City. Overall I'd say that you won't be dissapointed with this guy, I mean some of you might simply because he is a standard Theme based Mini-Figure you can get in any ordinary Race inspired LEGO Set with an actual car or something to drive/opperate. However, in my opinion he's still a great Mini-Figure and you can't really go wrong with him. Especially with that nice sharp print and the tight joints these Mini-Figures have.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4

"1UPminifig","2014-10-12T02:00:07.207Z","A Driver without a Race Car ","<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In late-2010 (Series 2) and early-2011 (Series 3) it was a good time for finding choice Collectable Minifigure themed characters. &nbsp;While LEGO has offered no collectible minifigure racers in prior series, the uniqueness about the Race Car Driver (Series 3) was that there was no accessory, rather there were two head pieces: a helmet and a hair piece. Let&rsquo;s drive into the review if you&rsquo;re racing to get this minifigure.</p>

<h3>Polybag and Instructions</h3>

<p>(I&rsquo;ve already talked about the Series 3 polybag in (massive!) detail in my earlier Space Alien review; this will be a condensed version.)</p>

<p>The Series 3 polybags are an eye-popping light green that compliments such characters as the Gorilla Suit figure on the front. I&rsquo;ve noticed that some series come with alternative colors to the lettering, and my Race Car Driver was found in a polybag featuring white and red letters, rather than the usual silver lettering. The Race Car Driver is absent from the featured characters on the polybag.</p>

<p>The instructions are stranded fare for the Collectable Minifigure line, a double sided sheet with a checklist on one side and instructions on how to build a minifigure on the other. The colour of the instructions change with each series, in this case, being the same light green as the polybag.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>This&nbsp;minifigure is built like any other. For the helmet, the visor is separate and snaps on.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p><strong>Helmet/Hair</strong>: Usually, you&rsquo;re given the choice of helmet or a hair piece &ndash; this time, you get both. However, both do not go on at the same time together. Therefore, the helmet acts more like an accessory if you&rsquo;re careful attaching the helmet to his hand. &nbsp;Using the black baseplate, stand your minifigure and place the bottom rim of the helmet in his hand. There is a limit to how far your character can lean or lower his arm, as the helmet mold does not come with a grip area, as it is on the current spaceman helmets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The helmet is red, like his suit, and features the Octan logo (white, red, green) on the upper forehead region. Making a small crowning circle, the black&amp;white checkerboard pattern of the racing flag. This pattern connects to the Octan logo. The visor piece is a tinted clear grey.</p>

<p>The Race Car Driver comes with a sandy blond hair solid mold that is designed to appear combed over with bangs; reminding me of Brad Pitt&rsquo;s hair in the movie, <em>Meet Joe Black</em>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Both the helmet and the hair would combine with other pieces for a variety of looks, particularly for City themes. &nbsp;Important &ndash; Beware/FYI: The helmet is difficult to detach from the head. The culprit is the torso&rsquo;s neck, which doesn&rsquo;t grip the head tightly enough to remove the helmet without the head coming off the body. The solution is to place the head on a different torso and then reassemble as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Head</strong>: &nbsp;The head of the Race Car Driver is the simplistic toothy smile and pupil eyed happy face. He has brown/blonde thick eyebrows that compliment his blonde hair. The grin has a black outline at the corner of the smile, as to indicate the separation of upper/bottom teeth. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Torso</strong>: The Race Car Driver makes no secret as to who is his sponsor, as the upper chest of his torso contains a white band with Octan clearing written in the middle (the &ldquo;Oc&rdquo; written in red letters and the &ldquo;tan&rdquo; written in green &ndash; on mine, there is a considerable typeface alignment error with the &ldquo;tan&rdquo; higher than the &ldquo;Oc&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>There are broken white lines throughout the shirt area, indicating no less than eight pockets. There are solid black lines that outline the zipper and collar, which also have white broken lines. The same broken white lines and solid black lines form the belt area, which is red, and tiny white lettering says &ldquo;N. Grooves&rdquo; (presumably, his name). &nbsp;On the top left and right pockets, there is a black design of what appears to be a wrench with a fire-blast handle, and cursive writing saying &ldquo;Certified Figure&rdquo; (I think?). Both of these are in black with a thick white outline. The driver comes with white gloved hands.</p>

<p><strong>Legs</strong>: We have a rare combination of colours with a standard red leg portion and the pelvic area outlined in white. There are no pockets, patches or other design elements and this left me disappointed given the amount of detail on the head and torso. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Extras</strong>: &nbsp;Like all LEGO Collectible Minifigures the Race Car Driver comes with a black display stand.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Usually, Collectable Minifigures are so unique that their playability is limited when left with a single figure, but the Race Car Driver can be added to so many sets and LEGO vehicles, that he&rsquo;s fun without needing more figures to interact with. The possibilities of play are too many to list. If you have basic red bricks and some red wheels, build this minifigure a matching car.</p>

<h3>Suggested Pairings</h3>

<p>The Race Car Driver naturally fits with any race theme or pieces/sets featuring Octan&rsquo;s logo to form a perfect pairing. With his bright red/white suit, the Ferrari sets also come to mind.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Even though the Race Car Driver is somewhat repetitive in the LEGO universe, I really do like this figure. Despite the lack of a traditional accessory and detailed legs, I like the blonde hair and the easy way he can be inserted into my LEGO play experience. &nbsp;3 out 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"StarKiller22515","2020-02-09T21:55:07.207Z","No Accessory?","<p>The helmet and torso are nice and have the Octan logo on it which is nice, but the legs are bland and the hair piece and face are generic and boring. It also doesn&#39;t come with an accessory which stinks. If you want this set you are basically just buying the torso and the helmet. I would personally not recommend this set unless you really like race cars or have other LEGO race cars but don&#39;t have enough drivers.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-08-21T19:59:56.963Z","a NEAT figure!","<p>So the eleventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3 is the Race Car Driver, and he&#39;s a neat figure. He was releases in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes seven pieces, if you do count the display stand. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>So I normally start with the piece on top, but this is where it gets a little controversial. See, his accessory IS the top, which is that helmet. I normally take a look at the accessories last, but since his accessory is an alternative to the hair, we can go ahead and talk about both. The hair might be the most interesting part of the figure. Not because the piece itself is special, as it is just that wig boy hair, but because the coloring it&#39;s caste in is pretty rare. I&#39;m not sure what other sets it came in, but we&#39;ve very rarely gotten the piece in that coloring. Then we have his helmet as well, which looks really good too. I really love the Octan logo printed on it, and it is made up of two parts: the helmet, and the visor.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which looks good as well. I like his chipper expression going on, with that smile. No alternate facial printing, which is to be expected from lots of CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso, which does have some pretty great printing. I like the stitches, as well as that Octan logo once again, and I don&#39;t know if that black writing is literate. If it is, it&#39;s pretty hard to make out. No back torso printing, which is present&nbsp;for almost all the series.</p>

<p>And finally, we have his legs, which have no printing. It is kind of interesting how the middle part is caste in white instead of red. I always like when CMF&#39;s have neat color patterns, so all good there.</p>

<p>And overall, I think this is a pretty solid figure. Partly because he&#39;s made of plastic, but also because this has some cool prints and pieces, like the hair, helmet, and head. We did get another race car driver in Series 18, and yes, that figure was WAY better. But not &#39;cause this is bad, but because he&#39;s so cool. So I think this figure could have been better, but still, I&#39;m not mad with what LEGO accomplished. And I think that wraps up this review! So check out my other Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews if you&#39;re interested, and thanks for reading!</p>
