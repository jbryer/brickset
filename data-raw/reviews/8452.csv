"CapnRex101","2011-01-01T12:14:02.743Z","8803 (9) - Rapper","<p>The Collectable Minifigures are turning out to be a gem. One great Minifigure for £1.99, what's not to like? This is the rapper who for me is one of the highlights of Series 3, the level of detail on the figure is incredible, from baseball cap to jeans it never fails to look great on any shelf.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some brilliant parts with the rapper, in fact every part is brilliant. But there are two in particular that catch my eye, the baseball cap and the radio. However I shall give my opinion on every piece.&nbsp;</p><p>I will start at the top with the cap, one of my favourite parts. The detail is sensational! The cap is predominantly black with ridges running from the edge of the hat to the top. The panel at the front is gold and has a small motif of the head of a generic Minifigure. This part also appears in the baseball player with different colours and printing.</p><p>The head is also very nice, it portrays the look of a rapper in reality very well, right down to the gold teeth and lovely shutter glasses. He also has a thin black beard which runs around his face.</p><p>His torso is again fairly good, with a chain, hanging from which is medallion with a dollar sign on it. His arms are yellow as he is wearing a sleeveless shirt.</p><p>The legs are very well detailed with chains, pockets and a belt. On the hip piece is printed the waste band of his boxer shorts, which are showing due to how low he is wearing his trousers.</p><p>His accessories are a gold and black microphone which was seen with the pop star from Series 2 and the wonderful radio, which has a handle and such detail as a&nbsp;cassette&nbsp;in the front with buttons, and even lines running across the two speakers, which look great.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I have to say this up there with the best of any series of the Collectable Minifigures so far, it's playability is limited, but he could feature in a Lego City display, at a concert or in a night club! Anyway, this little figure is amazing, everything about him is perfect, and so I can only give him...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"gime","2011-01-16T20:36:29.23Z","One of the best in S3","<p>This fig was in my first opened bag from Series 3.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Standard S3 green bag and the standard folded instruction. No barcode, dots/bumps are not reliable.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some nice unique parts here. First of all - the boombox. It's amazing, really detailed and high quality. Next are the golden mic and the hat.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>A real west-coast rapper in Lego Town. The minifig is extremely well-designed, details like the chain, beard and glasses add lots of realism.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>5 simple steps.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Really good looking. Very good quality, even the hat doesn't fall off.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A must have for all collectors, and a really nice addition to any lego town. I can imagine lots of play scenarios or mocs that could use this guy.</p><p>[img]http://gime.vot.pl/gime/8803_rapper.jpg[/img]</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2011-03-03T17:20:43.6Z","Can't Touch This","<p>Set #8803 Rapper: One of the must haves of the Collectible Mini-Figures Series 3. He was high on my list to get, and I believe I scored him along with the Mummy and a few others on my second batch of six purchased upon first discovering their location at retail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rapper includes two accessories, a gold tipped microphone and an actual LEGO Boombox, I bought LEGO City Mini-Figure Collection, which includes a buildable Boombox for the Female Citizen. This one is an actual single piece Boombox that I hope to see in future LEGO City or Town sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He's wearing a black baseball style cap with a gold front and the picture of a Mini-Figures head, not sure if it represents a baseball team in the LEGO Universe or just a styled piece, but it suits him. His torso is bare armed and features a dollar sign necklace on the print, his pants are a unique color and with a print that just says, blue jeans. Low riding blue jeans, the elastic band of his boxers are showing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His facial print is great, he's got a black beard with sideburns, black eyebrows, one of them looks like it might have a piercing of some sort. His smile is golden, quite literally, apparently he's replaced all of his teeth with gold ones so he must be really well off with his rapping. And the shades, those sunglasses he's wearing are an excellent touch. They aren't mirrored, I think they are called visored shades or something to that effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I strongly recommend this Mini-Figure and hope you have much luck in claiming one.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4

<p>the only thing I don't like about this minifigure is that their is too much Gold. In real life Rappers do not have that much gold. But if you like minifigures this one will make great adition to your Collection.&nbsp;&nbsp; Buy Him if you can&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks for reading</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-12T10:33:10.1Z","LEGO Collectable Minifigures (Series 3) - Rapper Review","This rapper minifig is one of the BEST minifigs of series 3 so far. The details on the torso, the legs and the face are just awsome. The cap has some very cool markings as well. We also get a microphone and a radio which are very useful pieces to have.<br><br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and

"AETerry","2011-04-12T12:46:20.087Z","Rapper Review","<p>Finally at long last I got the Rapper for series 3. Him along with the Tribal Chief were proving slightly difficult to locate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rapper was well worth it in the end. As a whole figure, he looks fantastic! He carries a gold topped microphone and has a one piece boom box that looks really cool and better then the boom boxes from a the Extreme Island Stunts theme with the skate park or the City Collection, or for that matter, any I would build from pieces as a kid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to the mini itself, I love the shade of blue and print job done to give the look of blue jeans. White shirt with a gold medalion, I love the hat, gold and black and I hope to see more ball caps in this style in the future. The face is good too, gold teeth and the visor shade look, I'm not sure that's what Rappers would wear now days, but on a minifigure, it's awesome!</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,5,5
"cityboy518ipswich","2011-04-14T09:37:54.457Z","I'm Not Afraid!","<p>The Rapper is in my opinion one of the best series 3 figures. He has light blue legs with&nbsp;a chain printed on them, a very detailed torso with a dollar necklace ($) and a head with some cool shades. He also has a new hat with a minifigure head printed in gold on it. He&nbsp;has some&nbsp;awesome accessories, they are a&nbsp;brand new boombox with some fantastic detail and a newish microphone with a gold tip. The microphone has been used in one other collectible minifigure. The complete figure is stellar and I highly recommend picking it up.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-08-25T21:59:50.74Z","An AWESOME figure!","<p>So the fifteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3 is the Rapper, and he&#39;s figure I&#39;m just not sure about. He was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting him off, we have that hat piece, which looks pretty good. I do really like that print, with the gold in the front and the minifigure head, and it just has really cool printing overall. What really surprises me, is that it was an entirely new mould. That is super cool, in my opinion.</p>

<p>And moving right along, we have that face print, which looks alright. I do think that beard looks a little odd, with its very square design, but nothing too bad. I do like the gold teeth, as well as those snazzy sunglasses. No alternate print, which could look pretty strange from behind.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso, which I do really like how that came out. I love the gold necklace, and he has no back printing, which is a little inconsistent with the necklace, but oh well. Back printing was sort of&nbsp;rare with older CMF&#39;s, so I don&#39;t really expect it.</p>

<p>Then we have his legs, which might be the most detailed part of the entire&nbsp;figure. I love the printing on them, from the very elaborate printing on the upper section, to the chains beside the pockets. I also really like the complex detail for the belt.</p>

<p>And then last but not least, we have his accessories. He actually has two, which is pretty generous by LEGO. I really like the microphone, with the gold top and black bottom. I also really like the detail on the boom box, which was also a new piece, so I really love that. The printing on it is good as well, with the gold and all.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a figure that has seriously grown on me. When I started this review, I thought he was okay. Now, I love this guy. He has great printing, two great new pieces, and a decent&nbsp;value for three dollars. And I think that wraps up this review! So if you found this helpful, check out my other Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and I hope this helped you decide whether you wanted to pay the estimated 11 to 12 dollars on Ebay. I think that&#39;s great value. Anyway, thank you for reading!</p>
