He looks awesome, has impressive new pieces, and even has little pointy ears! Who couldn't resist getting this guy? Lets talk more about him.</p>
<H4 style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">Parts</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The elf has many nice new pieces. He has a new bow piece, which is taller and more elegant than the original bow. There is also his hair, neatly combed backwards with cute, pointy yellow ears. His head, shield, torso and printed pants are all nice additions as well.<br/></p></li></ul>
<H4 style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">Playability</h4>

<li>I can imagine that many people would enjoying playing with this guy, seriously who doesn't like elfs?! I hope Lee Jones leaves some for us :P <br/></li></ul>
<H4 style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">Value</h4>
<ul>
<li>For TLG's $2.99 pricetag, I think this figure is definitely worth it. He's a great addition to any minifigure collection! <br/></li></ul>

There was no problem with recognizing of the both&nbsp;hidden people, but unfortunately all other sets were not recognizable at all - so I have chosen only 2 sets I thought I was sure what was inside.</p>
<p>Now I saw over 30-40 sets - only 2 of them were recognizable (in my opinion). One of them was gorilla guy - perfect match, but the second one should have been rapper, and was elf...</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very nice looking colours of torso and legs 
<li>Perfect printings of the armor 
<li>Interesting hair piece and face 
<li>Beautiful green cape 
<li>New very good looking long bow (except of arrow) </li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The hands and legs move too loose - it may be, that only mine&nbsp;figure&nbsp;has such defect. Why is it so? Is it only the one time imperfection or some of you do have the same problem? 
<li>Bow -&nbsp;I could never (and will never)&nbsp;understand how come that arrow holds on the lego bow all the time -&nbsp;it's against the natural philosophy ;) 
<li>Elf is the first bowman (since 1984), who has a shield! - who could have such a weird idea to give him both bow and shield? Does the lego elf have more hands than a proper human bowman? 
<li>Why didn't&nbsp;elf get a shield and a long sword instead of a long bow? In my opinion it would be the perfect match! And in such a match for me such warrior would get the highest note. 
<li>And last but not least: the long bow, as well as the common bow (27 years old, and still the same!)&nbsp;are very delicate - it is enough to grab it once to leave a track on it...</li></ul>

<p>Hey!&nbsp;In my opinion the Elf fig is the most wonderful fig out of the first four minifig series! Simply the best!</p>
<p>First of all, it has tons of nice accessories: the best shield ever carried by a minifig, the new longbow and the dark green cape. All of them is unique and wonderful.&nbsp;And if it is&nbsp;an&nbsp;Elf, it must have those special 'peaked' ears and blonde hair: and yes it has. So as the beautifully painted torso and legs.</p>
<p>The designers have proved their perfect taste, and the result is the perfect aesthetics of a fig one can imagine.</p>
<p>The final bonus makes this fig the best of the whole collectable minigure series is the quality. Although it has been manufactured in China, the Elf fig is perfectly crafted: there is no quality issue with this one at all. It is as good as any figure from a european made building set.</p>

"legospongepotter","2011-04-16T17:55:01.947Z","Yes, it is Legolas","Well of COURSE it is Legolas from the great Lord of the Rings (I'm reading the series and I saw the films). I hope many of you noticed that his name is LEGOlas.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This is probably one of the best Series 3 Minifigures and one of the greatest Minifigures of all time, and there are many reasons why. To start off, you get lots of great green colors and I believe everything except the bow is new.</div><div><br></div><h4>Hair</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The elf has white-ish/tan-ish/blond-ish hair. I guess it's a sandy color, really. All his hair smoothly glides backwards into small little stubs of hair on the back. His hair is also designed to have ears on them. It's really kind of part of the hair but&nbsp;printed&nbsp;yellow. However, it's pointy and cool&nbsp;nonetheless.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The only way his hair could be better is if the hair was designed so the ears actually stick out a little more. It's still cool, though and it's new. It's recolored to be brown and black in the Series 4 Werewolf. I hope this hair gets used a lot. Maybe in the future we'll have blue hair with purple ears. Anything's possible when it&nbsp;comes&nbsp;to Legos.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Head</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Next, we have the head. As you can see from the picture, the elf has a rather determined expression. You an see his cheekbones and his thin brown eyebrows. I don't understand the brown color, though. Shouldn't it be blond? His mouth is curved in a frown. If he was smiling, then he would definitely be Legolas. his skin, of course, is yellow. He has one face.</div><div><br></div><h4>Torso</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>His torso is brand new, as well. The printing is fantastic. You can see a silver belt along the bottom with a green emerald. He is wearing chain mail, and the detail is great with the silvery design. Around his neck is something brown that I have not figured out entirely. Some kind of sash? Possibly for arrows? The part where his green cloak fastens around his neck is printed, which is AWESOME. His arms are light green and his hands are yellow. The light green is a rare color when it comes to clothing, though it is the same color as roof pieces in Harry Potter. There is no back-printing.</div><div><br></div><h4>Legs</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The elf has brown legs with printing. Along his waist part there is some chain mail, which continues down his leg. There are&nbsp;some&nbsp;light brown pockets to go along. These legs are really great and are actually one of my favorite parts of the set.</div><div><br></div><h4>Shield</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>I believe this shied is new. It is gray&nbsp;along&nbsp;the edges and there is a bronze border with silvery designs along it. Inside the border is the same color green as the cloak with silver lines across, and a deer with great antlers&nbsp;printed&nbsp;in the middle like a symbol of peace or something. Well, the deer looks mad so maybe a symbol of nature....&nbsp;Anyway&nbsp;there is a handle on the back for the elf to hold it and is an excellent piece.</div><div><br></div><h4>Bow and Arrow</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This is basically the only piece that isn't new. However, it is still my first and remains cool. It is brown and looks like an bow&nbsp;getting&nbsp;ready to fire, with a brown arrow sticking out, preparing to fire. Along with the shield, you can stage great battles with this elf if you have this. Maybe if you want to make a Lord of the Rings MOC then soem of these would be helpful.</div><div><br></div><h4>Cloak</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This is the least special part of the set, which means its&nbsp;speciality&nbsp;on a 1 to 100 scale would be 95. It is a normal cloaks that goes&nbsp;around&nbsp;the neck and is held in place by the head. It is dark forest green, which I think is new.</div><div><br></div><h4>Stand</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This is the normal black stand that comes with every Collectable Minifigure. It is black and has four studs across in the middle.</div><div><br></div><h4>Overall</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This is my first amazingly stupendous Minifigure. There are so many details and it's a favorite of mine. There are sets that cost thirty, forty dollars that aren't as good as this set. I would highly&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;getting it. I only have two complaints: There should be a quiver for arrows, and I think it would've been cooler if he was smiling like Legolas does, or perhaps he had a double-printed&nbsp;head with a smile. Overall, this is a great Minifigure and no true Lego fan could stand&nbsp;being&nbsp;without it.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,2,4,5

<p>I was rather pleasantly surprised and pleased to see that the Collector Minifigures were on the shelf at my local Wal-Mart today. I was giving up hope on seeing anything show up in my area due to location and small county, small town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The elf was in the first package I opened up and he is one of the minifigures from series 3 that I've been really wanting. So that was high on the awesome factor for me as a collector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks wise, he is just one of the best minifigures in this series. The hair piece is sculpted or molded to give the appearance of pointed ears, he's got a very unique long bow piece that I have not seen with other Castle themed sets, a unique sheild, green cape and torso printing.</p>

<p>The Elf has a nice chainmail print on his torso and upper legs. There is a jewel in the center of his belt and his facial print evokes a serious expression of some kind. The hairpiece includes two pointed ears on either side to make the Elf look like an Elf. He comes with a new version of a long bow, the piece is diffierent from the standard Castle long bow and looks rather... Elven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shield accessory is the standard long shield, but with a great looking print on the front, it's a Stag with dangerous looking antlers in the center of a field of green and surrounded by a bronze looking trim. It's really quite interesting looking. The Elf also includes a green cape, what's good about this is that his chest print has a green cape clasp covering his neck, so it goes well together.</p>

I submit to you, however, the nonconformist opinion that he is not, and, in fact, far from being enamoured with Elf, we should all find ourselves severely annoyed by him.</div><div><br></div><div>Sure, there are some telltale signs - the flowing dark green cloak, the longbow, the pointy ears - but there is one piece of compelling evidence that gives everything away, and that is the shield, upon which is adorned the stylised logo of a deer or an elk.

Indeed, this obscure, reclusive, almost cult-like faction of LEGO Castle saw a grand total of three sets before fading into the shadows, frustrating future LEGO collectors for ages onwards who wish to partake in their ultra-coolness but are prevented from doing so due to their current and forevermore prohibitive price and inexplicable rarity. Indeed, with the possible exception of Fantasy Era’s Dwarves, Dark Forest is probably the most unique Castle subtheme, one that we are all hoping for a spiritual successor to but never get because LEGO is a cruel mistress.</div><div><br></div><div>What, then, are we supposed to make of Elf’s pointy ears and angry appearance? It’s quite simple. When the Dark Forest faction dissolved, the grand majority of its members were arrested and executed or otherwise forced to integrate into proper Castle society.

He is all that remains of the Dark Forest.</div><div><br></div><div>Is this a cool Minifig? Of course he is. You didn’t need another review to tell you that. In fact, if you are even a passing fan of Castle, you should do all that you can to get him immediately before he starts routinely going for $50 a pop, following exactly in the league of his legendary Dark Forest counterparts.

Because it has captured the essence of how a wood elf looks like translated to LEGO. While I do not really understand how the bow and the shield could work together technically speaking, they more than made up for just complimenting the minifigure itself. 

This is one of those minifigures you would appreciate on its own, and even more so if you amass an army of it.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

He was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes eight pieces, if you do count the display stand. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that hair/ear combo, which looks brilliant. It was new for the figure too, which is even cooler. I don&#39;t think it was dual-moulded, but rather the ears were printed, and I love how that all came out. You might think it was used for Legolas in the Lord of the Rings sets, but nope. They used a different piece for that. I don&#39;t mind though.</p>

<p>Then we have his face, which I like how you could use it for generic LEGO minifigures, as well as specific ones. That angry look really goes with anything. No alternate face printing, which is common for lots of CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>And his cape is next. It&#39;s done in green as well, with no printing or anything, but that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s just cool that they included it at all. It is that old, thicker material as well, which is to be expected. Let&#39;s just move right on to his torso, which has some awesome printing. I love how all that came out, with the continuing green cape design, and it&#39;s just really complex for its time. No alternate printing, but it is neat how the arms are done in sand green.</p>

<p>Next are his legs, and they have some cool printing on them as well. I really love those green flakes on front, as well as what appears to be boots. He does look kind of strange without side leg printing, but that&#39;s okay since this is an excellent figure otherwise.</p>

<p>And then lastly, we have his accessories, which look awesome as well. He has that reddish-brown bow and arrow, which isn&#39;t a rare piece whatsoever, and it has appeared in several CMF&#39;s. But that&#39;s fine, because it&#39;s very fitting. But then he also has that awesome shield. I really love the printing on it too, with the deer and all, and I just love how that all turned out.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s really my overall opinion of this figure. I just really love how he turned out. First off, this series is not at all one of the best, but this figure is one hundred percent my favorite in the series. And not just that, it&#39;s one of my favorite CMF&#39;s ever. Definitely my favorite CMF&nbsp;ever. There&#39;s been three CMF elves; one in Series 9, and the other in Series 17. The Series 17 is a close one, but I like this dude much more than the Series 9 one. And for three dollars, this is great value. And I think that&#39;s it for this review! So read my other Series 1, 2, and 3 revies, and thank you for reading!</p>
