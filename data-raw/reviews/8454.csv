<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Sumo Wrestler</strong>&nbsp;minifigure is one of the most unusual figure in this series, because there is no theme or genre directly attached to this figure. Yes, there is Ninjago, but sumo wrestling and ninjas&nbsp;really&nbsp;have nothing in common.&nbsp;He looks pretty cool,&nbsp;has a nice&nbsp;fat belly (good for sun-bathing Santa Claus :P)&nbsp;and an awesome hairdo!&nbsp;He is definitely a cool figure, but&nbsp;does he have what it takes to&nbsp;stand up to the rest of the competition?&nbsp;Lets talk more about him.</p>
<H4 style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">Parts</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The&nbsp;sumo has&nbsp;some interesting pieces. He has a new ""bun""&nbsp;hairpiece, which is nice but would be nice if it wasn't so <em>flat</em>. There are no textures in his hair which makes it look&nbsp;sort of fake.&nbsp;His bronze&nbsp;trophy is nice as&nbsp;well, we saw the gold version of this with the Karate Master.<br/></p></li></ul>
<H4 style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">Playability</h4>
<ul>
<li>I&nbsp;think that the sumo definitely has some cool features, but I think that not everyone will&nbsp;put this at the top of their want list. I think people who have no specific interest in Japan or sumo wrestling in of itself would probably not buy this figure.<br/></li></ul>
<H4 style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">Value</h4>
<ul>
<li>For TLG's $2.99 pricetag, I think this figure can be worth it to some people, but to others maybe not as much. As I said above if&nbsp;there is nothing in him that really catches your attention then you probably shouldn't bother picking him up.&nbsp;Either way, I think that he is&nbsp;a great addition to any minifigure collection.<br/></li></ul>
<H4 style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">Overall</h4>
<ul>
<li>Overall, I think that he is definitely a good&nbsp;minifigure but appears slightly plain and I feel he needs something else, but I'm not sure exactly&nbsp;what.</li></ul></DIV>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

<p>I bought eight of the sealed minifigs from one display box and 4 of them were this sumo.&nbsp; He is way too common and he's not very valuable.&nbsp; Despite being a good looking figure, he lacks any accessories.<br></p>",TRUE,4,1,1,5,2
"jonbuddy","2011-01-31T19:34:19.977Z","Bringing the illusion of a fat minifigure, it's the Sumo Wrestler!","<p>I picked this up yesterday at Downtown Disney in Orlando, and its not bad at all. The illusion of fat is a very new tactic from the amazing LEGO&nbsp;designers. There isn't much to be said about this set, because it is only a minifig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it has no effect whatsoever on the rating, this is most naked minifigure to date that I've seen (and I doubt TLG could go any farther :O)</p>

"AETerry","2011-04-07T20:33:31.24Z","I'd be angry too getting a bronze trophy...","<p>Out of Series 3, the Sumo Wrestler is the one whom I like the least. He's a figure I'll soon be pulling part to use with other MOCs rather then keep him together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The torso print to give the illusion for a fat minifigure is good. Not very flattering either, but it does the job. The hair piece is good too, looking like a bun, you can take and use it with any minifigure, particulalry females or a Samurai not wearing their helmet. Yep...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The facial expression is good, either of intense concentration or anger over getting a third place trophy... of which, as pointed out in the title, is bronze. As I have the Karate minifigure and the gold trophies, that leaves only looking for a silver trophy now... or waiting patiently to see if LEGO opts to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there's features and details that are good, but in the end, the Sumo as minifigure whole isn't my favorite.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, LEGO gives us a Sumo Wrestler, what does that mean? It means we have a torso that is topless, I believe the third such torso that has been produced by LEGO, the other two belonging to Dastan from Prince of Persia and the German Mechanic from Indiana Jones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't really have anything against the Sumo, he is a nice looking Mini-Figure with a very interesting print. His face sports a serious expression and his hair is very nicely done. His only accessory is a small statue, which was apparently introduced with the Karate Master of Series 2, but I didn't get any Series 2 so I didn't notice this. It's a little LEGO Trophy, and it is such a plain looking trophy that you can use it for anything. LEGO Oscar perhaps. (Hint, hint)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He seems to be a common figure though, I now have three of him, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'm hoping to trade my third one for either the Pilot, Samurai or Hula Girl I'm missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though I'd still strongly recommend this figure, you just might&nbsp;want a topless tubby guy in one of your MOCs one day and this torso gives you the beginnings of that. :)</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,4

"woodall_aidan","2012-04-07T11:33:12.65Z","8803-11 Sumo Wrestler","This set is easily my personal favorite in Series 3. The sumo wrestler has black hair in a bun and a similar face to the ninja, with a similar stressed face. The torso is yellow with a big belly and a big chest. The legs have black hips and yellow legs. The figure also has a little bronze statuette, which is supposed to be a trophy. It is the same part as the trophy from Series 2, but that one is in gold. This set deserves a 5/5. <br>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,4

"sideswinger","2020-08-15T16:47:25.127Z","Such a BORING figure!","<p>So the seventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3 is the Sumo Wrestler, and I just don&#39;t know about this figure. He was released in 2011, retailed for three bucks, and includes 6 pieces, if you count the display stand. I normally don&#39;t, but I guess I will here. Anyway, let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have his hair, which is the best part of the figure. It was new for the figure, so that&#39;s cool. And I do really love how that piece turned out, with the bun in the back, and it&#39;s been used in other minifigure series&#39; too, like Series 4, 13, and 15. The top looks a little strange, with its flat top, but I don&#39;t mind all too much.</p>

<p>Then we have his face, which looks decent. He has those bushy eyebrows, the wrinkles beside his eyes, and that angry frown looks cool as well. No alternate face, which is common for most CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, which has a bit of printing, to where he has those fat roles and all. It doesn&#39;t really work out to well in my opinion, but oh well. He has no back torso printing, which all the figures in Series 3 don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Next are his legs, and they have no printing. But it is cool how the middle part is caste in black, and the rest is yellow. Pretty smart how they did that and avoided doing any printing. Also a little lazy, in my opinion.&nbsp;But it is what is I guess.</p>

<p>Then last but not least, we have his accessory, which is pretty boring. It&#39;s just that golden trophy piece, which isn&#39;t new to the figure in any way whatsoever. That&#39;s also pretty lazy, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Overall, as you might know, this series is known to have some of the worst CMF&#39;s ever. This dude is a culprit, if you ask me. Yes, the hair is cool. But the rest of the figure is so incredibly boring, with no interesting parts or prints. And the value here is terrible. Three bucks for this? No thanks. Good news is, he goes for under ten bucks on Ebay (if you don&#39;t count shipping,). I think that&#39;s because he was a pretty common to get. Anyways, I think that wraps up this review! So check out my other Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
