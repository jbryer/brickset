In my opinion, he is the best of&nbsp;ALL of the&nbsp;figures, but you can decide that for yourself&nbsp;when you are finished with my&nbsp;review.&nbsp;Lets talk more about him.</p>
<H4 style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"" class=description>Parts</h4>

<li>
<p>The&nbsp;Space Alien&nbsp;has <strong>no</strong> new pieces, but some very nice recolored pieces. We have the SPIII&nbsp;Squidtron/punk head in a new color, lime green with black eyes and white pupils.&nbsp;Really awesome.&nbsp;He also has a nice purple space suit, with light bluish gray arms and lime hands, and then his pants have a dark bluish gray waist with purple legs. He also has a cool golden gun (one of my favorite pieces ever!) with a new short ""lightsaber"" rod in the color of trans-purple! There are lots of cool pieces in this set.<br/></p></li></ul></DIV>

<li>I think that the Space Alien is definitely a figure everyone will enjoy, all age groups should love this guy.<br/></li></ul></DIV>
<H4 style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold"">Value</h4>

<li>For TLG's $2.99 pricetag, I think this figure&nbsp;is definitely worth it! He comes with lots of great pieces, I'd even get multiples of him!&nbsp;I think that he is a great addition to any minifigure collection.</li></ul>
<h4>The Future</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pictures have been leaked (I will not give any links in order to not violate any agreements Brickset has made with TLG) of an upcoming theme named <em>""Alien Conquest"", </em>which will have aliens with lime green heads and color schemes that involve purple. This is a forerunner for this theme, people! Prepare thy wallets!</li></ul>

<p>The coloring of this figure is nice, with the purple, green and grey combination it might fit in to the new Alien Conquest sub-theme of Space. The torso print is very spacey, it looks like he's in some sort of space suit of interesting design.</p>

<p>The head has some nice painting on it, his eyes look good with white pupils in a black orb, and there are three black lines on the back top end of his head. His accessories are, a golden space blaster of some type and a purple lightsaber bar to give the appearance of a laser blast escaping from it. I really like this new space gun, it kind of looks like old 1940's sci-fi serials. (The stuff Lucas based Star Wars on, IE Buck Rogers.)</p>

Once I picked him up, I rapidly changed my opinion, though.</p>This CMF comes with purple legs/lilac waist, an Alien Conquest-style torso, and a green Squidman/Squidtron head. As far as accessories go, people have already commented on the nifty gold-colored ray gun; this is obviously styled on 50's ""ray guns"" and nicely adds to the ""alienness"" of the minifigure when compared to the Classic Space guns. The purple ""ray"" is kind of unnecessary visually, but this is a personal preference issue. At the very least, if you collect SW sets you now have another lightsaber blade for your other minifigures.<br><br>The torso is of note in that it is patterned on the torsos of the aliens in the new Alien Conquest theme; obviously, given the timing of Series 3 CMFs, this was a deliberate tie-in. Added to that is the paint job on his head -- it is exactly the same shade of green as the alien heads of the Alien Conquest minifigures, allowing you to use these CMFs to bulk out your attacking alien legions. I still think the facial expression looks a little goofy from a distance (""Colonel, is that alien monstrosity sticking his tongue out at me?"") but I can forgive that since it otherwise complements the other sets of the theme.<br><h4>Pros</h4>

"1UPminifig","2014-09-14T22:15:15.6Z","“Take me to your traffic light, foolish Earth cupcakes!”","<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>What was once an impossible dream &ndash; a minifigure wardrobe with prominent purple &ndash; the collectible series has been providing the pieces with Series 2&rsquo;s Disco Dude (check out my review of him) and Series 3&rsquo;s Space Alien. If a space alien battle doesn&rsquo;t jive with your Town/City world, you can swipe his duds and super cool laser-gun-sword to add some flair. Or you can keep the green-purple alien look and make a modern day X-Files/Roswell scenario!</p>

<p>Note:&nbsp; If you find yourself thinking there&rsquo;s something inexplicable familiar about Space Alien, you&rsquo;d be right. The Space Alien shares the same head piece with Squid Man and Squidtron from Space Police 3 (circa 2009 to 2010). It leaves me wondering if Space Alien is benevolent or an otherworldly criminal like his mold&rsquo;s predecessors.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Polybag and Instructions</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Series 3 Collectable Minifigures came in an eye-popping light green polybag &ndash; which isn&rsquo;t my favorite polybag colour (hat tip to Series 2) it&rsquo;s definitely better than ghastly orange of Series 4. In earlier reviews (check them out from my Brickset profile) I&rsquo;ve explained in (great) detail the general polybag look and, rather than repeat myself, I&rsquo;ll point out areas of new interest.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The character group picture in the front of the polybag includes our Space Man, bottom row and eye-catching in the front with his green skin. Intriguingly there is a link to the collectible minifigures page on the official LEGO website, which leads to various forms of hilarity, including bios for the characters. If you were wondering where I got the title for this review, you need to look there.</p>

<p>The Series 3 instructions are double-sided and are standard for the collectable minifigure line, with a checklist on one side and how-to on the other. The checklist shows all the minifigures from Series 3 (the Space Alien is #13), which I found helpful before discovering Brickset.com. The other side has instructions on how to make minifigure and an assortment of accessories from the series.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build is like any other minifigure &ndash; it&rsquo;s not rocket science &ndash; and the gun is a simple insert purple rod into the golden gun barrel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Head</strong>: The Space Alien shares the same triangle head shape as the squid criminals from Space Police 3. Unlike Squidman and Squidtron, who feature grey heads, the Space Alien is bright light green, a striking color that reminds me of a cartoon frog. &nbsp;In previous alien head pieces, rubber was used, but this Space Alien is made of solid plastic; in my opinion, a better choice for durability. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Space Alien&rsquo;s equilateral triangle head, when looking at it from a bird&rsquo;s eye view, looks like a futuristic game controller &ndash; with the circular eyes being the corners of the triangle&rsquo;s bottom and a slope between the eyes creating an indented forehead (hard to see from pictures). The black eyes sit upon the green circular eye dockets, providing dimension, with a vertical white line as a highlight to denote the wet eyeball effect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with Squidman and Squidtron, the tops of the head come with some colour shapes. In the case of Space Alien, he has three wavy black lines of various lengths, presumably to indicate skin wrinkling, tattoos and/or hair. The dramatic forehead slope bypasses any nose and goes straight to an open squid-like mouth, with three triangular green teeth (same color as the head) and a long and thin wavy red tongue hanging out just past the lower lip. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Torso</strong>: The torso of the Space Alien is amazingly detailed and a testament to the high standards of the Collectable Minifigure line. I love the dark purple on the Space Alien&rsquo;s torso, it&rsquo;s a color that&rsquo;s really lacking in the LEGO universe, and impressed with the light lavender sleeves. The Space Alien doesn&rsquo;t wear gloves, as his hands are green just like the head. Expertly drawn on his shirt, the Space Alien torso had a mix of bronze, silver and icy blue details that appears to be a globe-like breathing apparatus and utility belt. The bronze/blue tubes interconnect and there appears to be a bronze neck/chin collar (maybe a pulled down mask).&nbsp; He&rsquo;s also wearing a silver utility belt around his waist with two bronze pouches and a bronze belt buckle; the finer details on these are not lacking. Unfortunately, there are no back or side detailing. The torso makes me think that those who are MOCkers may think to use it as steampunk clothing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Legs</strong>: The legs are lacking in comparison to the other Space Alien pieces (no detailing), just plain dark purple with the waist and pelvic region having dark grey creases. Personally, I chose to switched pants with Disco Dude, thereby adding white legs to the Space Alien for contrast and giving Disco Dude a less dated and better suited appearance (check my profile for a review of Disco Dude from Series 2). &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong>: The Space Alien comes with a very cool retro looking laser gun. The gun comes in two pieces: a purple translucent wand/beam (just like the Star Wars lightsaber) that fits into the barrel of the metallic golden gun. The golden gun is definitely retro 1950&rsquo;s Sci-Fi in appearance, with a multitude of molded details that are two complex to describe. There are two holes on the side of the gun where you can put small round stud pieces, but none come in the polybag offerings. By the way, interestingly, there a number 2 on one side of the trigger and a 4 on the other, I have no clue what purpose they have if any. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Like all Collectable Minifigures, the playability of a single one is limited but there are many play scenarios for the Space Alien; such as reenacting movies such as Men in Black, Independence Day, and/or Mars Attacks! Other choices are X-Files, Twilight Zone, or something in the style of Ed Wood/1950&rsquo;s horror (mutant frogmen?) &nbsp;The Space Alien is a great army builder as bodyguards or grunts for Squidman and/or Squidtron&rsquo;s criminal empire. If you&rsquo;re in to more peaceful play, they could be actors playing aliens (Halloween) or if Squidman turns straight (pure fantasy, I know) they could be back up dancers for his intergalactic pop music tour. Perhaps, more simply, you can add the Space Alien as one of the colourful characters to any of the Star Wars Mos Eilsey Cantina sets. &nbsp;If you have kids (or are one) there is much fun to be had with this little guy with some imagination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Suggested Pairings</h3>

<p>The Space Alien goes very well with any of the Space Police 3 set and more specifically with&nbsp;<em>5969: Squidman Escape</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>5980: Squid man&rsquo;s Pitstop&nbsp;</em>and I believe this Minifigure would feel right at home with either of those sets and gives some diversity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In conclusion I really like this Minifigure because it closely resembles and fits in with one of my favorite space themes: Space Police 3. He also has a very detailed torso and features rare purple pieces, along with his striking amphibian-like alien head. &nbsp;5 out of 5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: When looking for him try feeling for the head.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-08-24T23:57:06.117Z","One BORING figure!","<p>So the thirteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3 is the Space Alien, and I&#39;m not really a big fan of this guy. He was releases in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a close look!</p>

<p>Starting him off, we have that alien headpiece, which is the most interesting part of the figure. It was not a new piece, as it is reused from the 2009 Space Police 3 sets, but this was a new print for him, as well as a new color.&nbsp;And I do like how the printing turned out, it&#39;s just that, since it isn&#39;t new, I wish they would&#39;ve done more. And the printing on him is pretty little too, with only the eyes, tongue, and a few strands of hair on top.&nbsp;The moulding on the mouth is a little creepy, with the sharp teeth, but&nbsp;I wish the teeth had some printing on them.&nbsp;Oh well. It is sort of neat how there is black printing all around the eyes. But with all that considered, I still wish it was more exciting.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso printing, which is alright. Nothing overly special, but oh well. It is just&nbsp;that gray center part with all the gold and blue wires connected to it, and he also has that belt on the bottom. No back torso printing, which is common for older CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>And his legs are nothing too interesting, although it is sort of neat how the top is that gray color and the rest is purple. Still, nothing too great, therefore I&#39;ll be continuing onto his accessory, which is just that ray gun. It is caste in gold, which is a nice color. It also has that trans-purple rod piece connected to it. But gosh, the ray gun+trans-rod combo is terribly overused in the world of CMF. Back then, this was our third figure with this combo, so it wasn&#39;t as big of a deal then. Still, getting the same accessory three times is pretty bad. But it isn&#39;t anything compared to how many times we&#39;ve got it nowadays.</p>

<p>Overall, this series is possibly my least favorite series ever, due to the boring figures in it. This dude is one of those figures. His parts are just very uninteresting, as is the figure overall. I mean, aliens are very common in the world of CMF, and I think this one might be my least favorite of them all. To make a long story short, he has a boring look, boring pieces, and a terrible price. And I think that wraps up this review! So check out my other Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: Basic series 3 bag and booklet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure: Space Alien is the only alien figure in series 3. The printing on the torso is very nice, but there is no printing on the legs. The head piece is weird looking, and I like it.</p>

<p>Parts: The set comes with six parts. The head and the torso are unique, but the laser pistol and the lightsaber blade aren&#39;t. I&#39;m not sure about the legs, but I think they are not unique.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: Just put the mini-fig together.</p>

<p>Complete Build: Overall this figure falls into the pretty interesting category. I really like the alien figures in the minifigure series. I&#39;m going to put this on display with my Alien Conquest and Galaxy Squad sets. Overall I would give this set a 4.8/5.</p>
