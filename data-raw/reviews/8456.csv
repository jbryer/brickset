<li>Hello, I have an intresting story to tell today. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I had gone on brickset, thinking why TOYS-R-US doesn't have enough sales,&nbsp;and low and behold, I saw the BUY 1 GET 1 50% off coupon, for ANY THEME. I showed it to my dad and he decided to use it to buy&nbsp;me my christmaas gifts with the coupon.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in my hesterical state,&nbsp;my dad&nbsp;drive me to&nbsp;our local Toys-R-us with the hopes of achieving the blue&nbsp;ATT and ARC-170. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we got there, I ran in with my sister,&nbsp;who just HAD to come along&nbsp;(Im pretty sure you know why I let her come along&nbsp;if you have ever had a sibling&nbsp;threaten you while she's sitting on you). So&nbsp;we got inside, zoomed into the lego section and I started looking for the sets I had in my mind. Suddenly, my sister asked I could buy&nbsp;her the thing in her hand. I slowly turn around, wondering what the heck she wants, AND SHES HOLDING UP A SERIES 3 MINIFIGURE! </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see the beautiful green box, sitting on its perch,&nbsp;just waiting to be perchased. With all my&nbsp;might, I&nbsp;reach up to grab one,&nbsp;all distractions&nbsp;fading away like air when my sister pipes up, ""Their&nbsp;$4.00 each."".......(pause).......""What!"", I yell, causing several adults to ackwardly&nbsp;move their children to another area. I stood there with my mouth&nbsp;open. I couldn't believe the had raised the price two whole&nbsp;bucks! I decided its better then nothing, and bought as many as I could. (I'm a sucker for these things.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I had walked out of the store with an ATT, an ARC-170 star&nbsp;fighter, about 9 minifigs, and a free lego USB drive for heroicly spending more then $75 dollars.</p>
<p>(I actually&nbsp;got to keep only&nbsp;5&nbsp;of the&nbsp;9 because I ""had"" to give two to my loving, beautiful sister) &gt;:(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, now about the mummy.</p>
<p>PROS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -diffrent then previous mummys</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Printed on the sides of the legs</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-white</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - and just a biased love of mummys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-WAY TO&nbsp;overpriced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-came out at a bad time with the ""pharaohs Quest"" and all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you see this one buy it at any price&nbsp;</p>

He has a great overall design and&nbsp;crossover appeal to both LEGO fans and fans of classic horror.This little guy has detailed wraparound printing on his leg's which I found to be surprising and appealing, however the lack of the same treatment on the torso gives the piece an awkward look to a certain degree. Also it would seem that TLG really phoned it in with the amazing accesory.....a red scorpion. One more for the pit on Scorpion Pyramid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, <em>another</em>&nbsp;mummy minifigure in the pyramid shaped shadow cast by the Pharaoh's Quest subtheme might seem like overkill, but upon further thought it becomes apparent that this is the best time to have troop buildable ""grunt"" mummies for your Egyptian army. I find that although the dim jade eyes and muted green flesh of the CM mummy is not an exact match to the grey skin and ruby eyes of the PQ undead, they mesh very nicely in a display.... especially when you have collectable minifig mummies in greater force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Overall a good buy if you are into troop building, mummies, or minifigures, but there is no real building experience to be had here, and $2.99 is probably the cheapest you are going to find this bad boy.</p>

"davy_jones","2011-03-07T01:36:09.72Z","I want my Mummy","<p>At first&nbsp;I thought it was coincidence that monsters such as a zombie, witch and vampire would appear but then it sunk in that Lego has clearly planned this, what more with the upcoming werewolf. So I wanted this piece regardless of whether it was up to mark or not for my monsters series.</p>
<p>The good:</p>
<p>Details, as usual. The figure paint scheme has a kind of cartoony mummy feel. Maybe the kind one would expect to see in Scooby Doo cartoons and I like it. The grim expression gives the minifig 'life' or is it death? Hhmmm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bad:</p>
<p>No idea why it comes with a red scorpion. Although this is my first red one in a sea of blacks.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"MisterBones","2010-12-28T14:00:23.557Z","The Mummy Returns....again","<p>This is a great addition to any spooky set.&nbsp; The fact that this is now the fourth different mummy&nbsp;makes the ability to create&nbsp;some very nice spooky scenes as&nbsp;easy&nbsp;as rising from the dead.&nbsp; Using the Adventure Egypt, Studio,&nbsp;PQ minion mummy and&nbsp;Amset-Ra from the PQ line gives one a wide array of mischief making mummies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actual figure is quite well done, the torso is painted on both sides and the green rotting flesh under the white bandages gives the figure a unique look.&nbsp; The legs, however, are only painted on the front and sides, but with the holes on the back of the legs, this is to be expected.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2011-03-03T16:31:23.963Z","Abbot, ABBOT!","<p>Set #8803 Mummy: Obviously my review title will not be understandable to everyone, it is a clever nod to an old Universal film, Abbot &amp; Costello Meet the Mummy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what I thought of when I first saw the Series 2 and 3 Monster Mini-Figures. They look like something out of old Universal horror classics, and they are really quite nice. Just a shame I don't have any Series 2 figures yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not the first Mummy LEGO has ever given us. Adventurers has the honor of showing us the first LEGO Mummy Mini-Figure, well it's a Pharaoh Mini-Figure, but he's meant to be a Mummy. Then we saw a real Mummy in LEGO Studios and recently, this year in fact, LEGO Introduced us to the Warrior Mummies of Pharaoh's Quest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Series 3 Mummy however is definitely different, if anything I would have to say that this one is the very image of what one expects a mummy to look like. Since he isn't wearing any headdresses or anything. The print on this guy is almost perfect, not only does the torso have a front and back printing of mummy wrappings, but the arms and legs also have wrapping printed in certain key areas. (This is the only flaw in the figure, there are bare patches of white that aren't printed on, making for a very unaesthetic looking print.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His head only has the print on his face, the sides and back don't show the wrappings, his face looks suitably decayed though with sickly green coloring and horrid green eyes with yellow pupils.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mummy comes with only one accessory. A very strange and standard accessory really, he's got a scorpion. Yes, I believe this is the first Collectible Mini-Figure to include one of the small LEGO Animals. And in a color you won't see anywhere else, a really dark red.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that the Mummy is a worthy addition to your Mini-Figures collection and can actually fit nicely in any Egypt inspired themes or displays or even a Universal Monsters Movie Display.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standing it next to my Witch Minifigure and having seen pictures of the Vampire, Werewolf, Zombie and Frankenstein's Monster minfigures, he works great for a Halloween Monsters theme and/or Universal Monster minifigure collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When putting it next to the mummies from the Pharoah's Quest theme, he suddenly feels out of place... all the Pharoah's Quest mummies that I have are grey, suggesting age and the CM mummy is white, looking brand new and made for a movie set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

"8BrickMario","2015-10-03T22:17:17.527Z","Of curse you should have him!","<p>Although this minifigure was among the most common of Series 3, he still appealed to me, and I had to have him. Was my decision a few years ago worth it?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging for Series 3 was a nice lime green color, and the checklist included looked good.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this minifigure are very good for the character, but practically useless for anyone else.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>He looks really nice. He&#39;s one of the most detailed minifigures of the time, as both of his arms are printed, along with his back and two sides of his legs. Of course, he&#39;s covered in bandages, and his green flesh is visible in the gaps. His face is the least covered, and shows his lime green eyes and a disapproving frown. His accessory (not shown in the image above) is a dark red scorpion, which was rare, but very common in your own collection&nbsp;if you bought Series 3 blindly!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think he&#39;s a really nice figure. He definitely adds variety to the mummies, and he&#39;s the first truly Halloween-inspired one, too. While he may not be a highlight, he&#39;s definitely a good figure to have.&nbsp;</p>

",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"sideswinger","2020-08-16T15:33:52.463Z","One of the best!","<p>So the eighth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3 is the Mummy, and he&#39;s an alright figure. He was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 5 pieces, if you do count the display stand. In past reviews, I have not counted it, but let&#39;s start counting the display stand in the piece count. Anyway, let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>He has no hair but rather, a blank stud; therefore let&#39;s move on to his head. It has some alright printing on it, with green flesh, and his green eyes look creepy-in a good way. I wish LEGO did printing around the whole head here, &#39;cause that would&#39;ve looked epic. But side head printing is extremely rare with LEGO, so I don&#39;t really expect it. No back head printing, which I would&#39;ve liked if they had printed more of those straps and whatnot. But oh well.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso and arms, which has one thing that I love: back torso printing. It&#39;s just more of those white straps&nbsp;and all, which is cool. But that&#39;s not what makes me love it. This is the first CMF ever to have back torso printing. That&#39;s just so awesome, and I love how LEGO went the extra mile to do that. He has some nice front printing as well, but the arms look amazing too. That&#39;s just some really complex printing for its time.</p>

<p>Then we have his legs, which have some more cool printing. It&#39;s pretty complex for its time as well, with all those white straps and all, and the green screen showing underneath looks pretty creepy as well. And this guy has some side leg printing too, which has some more of that complex printing.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have his accessory, which isn&#39;t anything too special. It actually isn&#39;t shown in the image, so you&#39;ll to take my word for it. Anyway, it&#39;s just a red scorpion, which was far from a new part. In fact, it&#39;s extremely common. What&#39;s strange is that in the fan picked 4 pack, they swapped the red scorpion for a gold one. Not sure why they needed to do that, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>And overall, this figure takes the spot of my third or fourth&nbsp;favorite figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3, only because of his amazing printing. Plus, this is a pretty historical figure, since he was the first CMF to have back torso printing. His accessory is lame, but just the amount of complex printing on his legs, arms, and torso really blows me away. However, with that being said, it isn&#39;t all too amazing nowadays. Since we got the Mummy in Series 19, this one just isn&#39;t that interesting, which is why I&#39;ve given him a three. Still, he&#39;s one of the best in the series since this is a fairly lousy series. Three bucks is a little much, but now, he goes for about seven to ten bucks without shipping, so he&#39;s pretty cheap.</p>

<p>But I think that wraps up this review! So check out my Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
