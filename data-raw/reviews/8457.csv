"Odeinoichus","2011-03-02T12:05:50.577Z","Match Point","<p>Set #8803 Tennis Player: LEGO Mini-Figures Series 3 has been upon us for quite some time, unlike Series One or Two I actively stalked these elusive figures and have found thirteen of them so far in my quest... Three more and I'll have all sixteen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tennis Player is a female Mini-Figure with a stellar new print, her hairpiece is the same as Series One's Nurse, only this is a lighter shade, possibly meant to invoke a red head as opposed to a brunette, but she still looks brunette to me, just a lighter toned one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her outfit was unique, at first I thought the legs were the same as the Cheerleader's, but upon closer inspection I discovered that while they share similar design patterns they are not identical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I think the Tennis Player is an excellent addition to your Mini-Figure collection. Three reasons for this, she has an interesting Tennis Raquet accessory, her print is highly unique, even with doubles of this one you can easily swap her hair with another female's hair and she'd still look like a different character, and naturally she's female. A sex that is sorely lacking in most LEGO sets. Strongly Recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,4
"alva","2011-03-10T20:17:40.947Z","Great Sport Theme Minifig","I think Lego really doing a great job when launch this minifig.<br>What make the minifig really unique is the racket. Really nice addition to the minifig accessories. It really opens a lot of MOC possibility, related to tennis world. <br>What still missing is the ball, I think Lego should release a new ball for tennis, it will look really nice.<br><br>In term of minifig, there's nothing unusual. I like the design of the shirt, it really look like a sport shirt.<br><br>What I don't like is the leg. The printed skirt is too long for a tennis player. It goes around 3/4 of the length of the leg, so it means that the skirt will make the player trips.<br>But this is minor and I don't think lots of people will be disturbed by this.<br>",TRUE,3,2,2,5,5

"AETerry","2011-03-29T13:30:43.823Z","Tennis Player Review","<p>This is an okay minifigure. There wasn't anything compelling about the picture when I first saw it that's a ""gotta have it!"" unless you're going out to collect all of the minifigures in a series that come out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She's decent, has a head piece that says this is for a female minifigures, has a studious look of concentration. The hair piece I haven't seen before, brown pony tail mold. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it wasn't for the tennis racket she's carrying, I wouldn't know what this minifigure was to be for. There's something to be said for simplicity with this set too and not trying to over do it on the print design. In the long run I'd have to say one more female minifigure is well worth it for my MOCs.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,4

I also recommend to get a duplicate of this minifigure if you want to make a Tennis court or a film about Tennis. I also like the new racket piece as it can be used as a weapon like the baseball bat. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, when Series 3 came out, they took the barcodes. They changed it to a style called bumpcodes. Instead of the barcodes, they put bumps at the bottom of the packet. This minifigure might be hard to get.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-10T06:49:06.317Z","LEGO Collectable Minifigures (Series 3) - Tennis Player Review","This minifig is a very useful figure to have, because LEGO never made tennis players before. The tennis racket looks very detailed and I also like the new hair which LEGO has introduced with the Collectable Minifigures theme. I really can't complain much about this character.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and

"United_Bricks","2011-10-09T15:55:43.183Z","Review of set 8803 Tennis Player","The tennis player is a nice little minifigure, it is good if you have two of these minifigures so then you can have a tennis match. You get the minifigure and a new tennis racket which you can only get in this set. It would have been good if they had included a shuttle cock.<br><br>Her hair is the same as the series 1 Nurse, but this one is a lighter shade of brown. She has a concentrated face, like she's playing a tennis match. Her torso is a tennis players strip, she has yellow arms. She is wearing shorts. <br>&nbsp;<br>Her new tennis racket is really nice and is something which will be good for mocs. The racket is white and has square holes.<br>Overall this is a nice minifigure and is good if you get two to have a tennis match.

"sideswinger","2020-08-20T16:46:24.257Z","An okay figure!","<p>So the Tennis Player is the tenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3, and she&#39;s a decent figure. She was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces if you do count the display stand. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that pony-tail hairpiece, and it is caste in that burnt orange color, and back in the day, this was an exclusive color. Of course now, we&#39;ve got it in some other themes like Avengers and Jurassic World. Hard to believe that piece was introduced in the CMF line, since it&#39;s been used for so many characters nowadays. But still, it&#39;s neat that this was a new color back then.</p>

<p>Next we have her face, which I like it when LEGO gives us generic faces. They could be used with lots of customs and whatnot. Here, we have a kind of determined look, and I really love how that came out. It&#39;s very fitting, seeing how competitive tennis players can be.</p>

<p>Next up is her torso, which has some pretty good printing. I do like the blue on top, as well as her curve lines, and she doesn&#39;t have any back printing, which is unfortunate, but expected.</p>

<p>Moving right along, we have her legs which have some more neat printing. I really like the ruffles on the front, as well as the yellow skin up front, and what&#39;s even cooler is that she has some cool side leg printing, with the yellow skin and all. Just some great printing all around them.</p>

<p>And last but definitely not least, we have her accessory which is that tennis racket. And boy, I love how that came out. It was new for the figure, which is awesome. And I might be wrong, but I think the coloring for it is exclusive to the figure, even to this day. The piece has some incredible moulding for its time, with all those holes and all, and it just looks great.</p>

<p>Overall, this figure is one of my favorites in Series 3, and I do like how she came out. This figure is the first out of 3 CMF tennis players, and I definitely think she&#39;s my favorite of them. I like how the hair was a new color, and I just really like the figure as a whole. But I do think three dollars might be a little much for 6 pieces, and I think two dollars would&#39;ve been a little better. Oh well. Anyway, I think that wraps up this review! So check out my Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and thank you for reading!</p>

"AlkkuV","2022-02-05T14:24:33.59Z","Tennis Player.","<p>Hello guys, it&#39;s AlkkuV, back with another review. Continuation in series 3, the Tennis Player. This is the fourth minifigure i&#39;m reviewing, and there are two more in series 3 after this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: Basic series 3 bag and booklet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure: Tennis Player, another female mini-fig. She comes with a tennis racket, of course. The printing on the legs is fabulous for a 2011 figure, because it continues to the sides of the legs. The torso lacks printing sadly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: The set comes with six parts, and the head and the hair are not unique, but everything else is.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: Just put the mini-fig together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete Build: This falls into the quite boring category. I just don&#39;t really like the figure, but still I would give this set a 4.6/5.</p>
