<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Standard S3 green bag and the standard folded instruction.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Not many of them. Basically minifig with a baseball bat and hat. The bat can be considered an unique piece. I don't remember any other sets that had one. No spare parts of course.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Plain and simple but you can easily tell that this is a baseball player.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>4 steps.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Looks nice, quality is very good, hat doesn't fall off.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is not an extremely amusing minifigure but I like the idea of a minifig baseball player.</p><p>Also, I believe it can be easily incorporated into many MOCs.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>[img]http://gime.vot.pl/gime/8803_baseballer.jpg[/img]</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5

<p>Now that I've got one and I've been looking at him him closer, I find myself changing my intial opinion. The design print for the minifigure is very good and makes him stand out as a noticable bright and colorful minifigure. Baseball bat accessory, can't go wrong there. Especially if you're building a zombie MOC and want something to smack the walking dead with upside the head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And his cap... is very different then any ballcap style hat that LEGO has done before. I'd be worth it to try and get more of these figures for the hat and MOCs.</p>

<p>He stands out in a bright colorful ""bubble gum"" eye candy way for me and has ended up being a very fun minifigure to dispaly now. I'll be keeping him.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,3,4

A highly sought after figure in my opinion and very desireable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Baseball Player has a brand new torso print, he's wearing his uniform for the Clutchers baseballe team, his legs have a belt print on the top and that's pretty much it. As far as Mini-Figures themes go the Baseball Player is great, LEGO gave us Soccer/Football, Basketball and Hockey based sports figures during their LEGO Sports phase, but Baseball is one of those sports that was, sadly, not represented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>True, outside of America, the sport doesn't seem to be played much from what I know on the subject, this Mini-Figure includes a LEGO Baseball Bat accessory and a newly sculpted Baseball Cap headgear. About the only thing that could improve on this guy is if he included a LEGO Baseball, but a plain white stud will work for now as his ball. Overall I'd say this Mini-Figure is definitely worthy of joining your Mini-Figure collection. If you get more than one you could always change his head with a different figure or something. You'll need quite a few to make a full team of players though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suppose he could also use a glove, but since when does a batter bring his glove with him to the plate?</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-02-08T09:27:55.943Z","Now up to bat...Series 3!","This little minifig is quite cool. He has a new baseball cap with red and white, and his jersey reveals his team is called the Clutchers. His only accessory is a baseball bat, which although is cool, I would have liked if he came with a glove too- a baseball bat isn't enough in my opinion. But the figure in&nbsp;general is quite cool, so when you get it, you can smile to learn you have one of the coolest minifigures LEGO has ever made. :)",FALSE,4,3,1,2,4
"1UPminifig","2014-03-04T08:03:11.933Z","A Solid Baseball Figure but Not Much To Do","<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>

<p>This is the start of what I will call the week of reviews. I&rsquo;ve been working on some other writing so I haven&rsquo;t been getting many reviews out, but this week I&rsquo;m going to give you a review Monday through Friday. Today&rsquo;s Review as you can see is the Baseball player.</p>

<p><strong>Box and Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Like all Collectable Minifigures he&rsquo;s packaged in a random polybag, so you never know which one you&rsquo;ll get. Every Collectable Minifigure Series comes with a different colour bag, in the case of Series Three; it&rsquo;s a very playful light green.</p>

<p>On the front of the packaging we can see some of the other minifigures from the series; the Baseball player is sadly absent.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a bunch of other little things on the packaging, such as, series number, how many minifigures are in each series [16] and of course the Collectable Minifigure logo.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been reading my reviews you know what the instructions of these set look like, for those of you who don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll give the rundown. On one side you are shown how to make a minifigure, and shown a bunch of accessories from Series Three.</p>

<p>The other side is just a simple checklist, which was real help before I found Brickset. As I discussed some of our minifigure friends are sadly missing from the packaging. All pretty standard fair for the Collectable Minifigure Series, but now let&rsquo;s get into the meat of the review.</p>

<p><strong>Building</strong></p>

<p>Since last I wrote building a minifigure has not gotten harder.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hair/Head: </strong>The Baseball player comes with a new baseball cap, which I believe is the first improvement since the 80s/90s one.&nbsp; The Baseball cap is a nice red and white colour scheme, with a red C on the front, a basic cap, but arguably better than the original.</p>

<p><strong>Head: </strong>The face is pretty basic. an update of the original smiley face. He has a nice closed mouth smile and he&rsquo;s going along with the new trend of having pupils. He also has simple black eyebrows, a simple face, but the simplicity, at least in my opinion, makes him charming, a throwback to the faces of the 80s and 90s.</p>

<p><strong>Torso: </strong>He has a relatively simple red and white torso that goes well with his cap. Red and white lines run down his shirt and we can see that it&rsquo;s a button down jersey. We can also see in the middle a logo which I can make out as saying Clutch something, I can&rsquo;t tell what the others letters are.</p>

<p>I would like to point out that Clutch is most likely in reference to the god awful Lego Movie protagonist, Clutch Powers, but that&rsquo;s a review for another day. Also if you compare Collectable Minifigure hands and ones from the regular lines you can see that the Collectable ones are a notability lighter shade.</p>

<p><strong>Legs:</strong> The legs are incredibly simple compared to others we&rsquo;ve seen out of the Collectable Minifigure line. It&rsquo;s only defining feature is the black belt and silver buckle, the rest being just white, however it&rsquo;s more detailed than most legs that come in the regular Lego lines. I believe that it&rsquo;s harder to take the legs off of Collectable Minifigures; this can be seen as a pro or a con to some.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:&nbsp; </strong>The accessory that comes with the Baseball player is appropriately enough a baseball bat. This is the only baseball bat I believe the Lego Company has ever made, and it looks quite nice. The grip of the bat is white with some curving; it might well be my favorite part of the bat.</p>

<p>The top of the Baseball bat is brown as you would expect, but it seems a bit off. I can&rsquo;t put my finger on it, but I think the top of the bat is a bit too fat, causing it to look a little unnatural. You can also see the part number and the Lego logo on it.</p>

<p><strong>Playability </strong></p>

<p>Like all Collectable Minifigures the play value of one is very limited and unlike the surfer or mummy there really is no play value to him.</p>

<p><strong>Suggested Pairings </strong></p>

<p>There used to be a sports theme in the early 2000s, but sadly they never made any baseball sets. So the only other Baseball related Lego set is the Collectable Minifigure Baseball player from Series 10, who&rsquo;s a pitcher.&nbsp; So I would suggest buying a couple of both, change the heads and there you go, you have your very own &ldquo;custom&rdquo; Lego sports team.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>This is not very detailed minifigure, but I like it because it reminds me of the older Lego Minifigures with a much needed update.&nbsp; Why the fact it only has one other set to complement it hurts the playability, I would still suggest looking for him.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When looking for him try feeling for the Baseball bat or cap.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-08-31T01:48:24.46Z","A FANTASTIC figure!","<p>So the sixteenth and final figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3 is the Baseball Player, and he&#39;s a really neat figure in my opinion. He was released in 2011, retailed or three bucks, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that cap piece which, believe it or not, was new for the series. And I adore the printing on it, with the white front plus the &quot;C&quot; printing and all. I think that is SUPER useful outside the setting-especially if your name starts with the letter C.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which I think is decent. I always like it when LEGO gives us more generic faces because they&#39;re super useful outside the setting, but this one looks almost&nbsp;<em>too&nbsp;</em>generic. In other words, it looks kind of boring to me. I wish it just had more detail.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, which does have some brilliant printing on it. I really love the complex red lines, as well as that sweet &quot;Clutchers&quot; printing. It&#39;s pretty complex for its time too. And I do sort of wish he had side arm printing, but this was 2011, so you can&#39;t really expect it. I do also wish he had back torso printing. It was rare for Series 3, but not inexistent, so kind of lame there.</p>

<p>Then we have his legs, which do have some more great printing, with the baseball belt and all. And if you&#39;ve played baseball, you know how tight and uncomfortable those pants can be. It was hard getting them&nbsp;<em>on,</em>&nbsp;but even&nbsp;harder getting them&nbsp;<em>off.&nbsp;</em>Anyway, the legs are pretty useful for baseball players, and casual civilians alike.</p>

<p>And last but definitely not least, we have his accessory, which is that bat. What interests me is that it was a completely new mould for the figure, so all cool there. I do love how the piece came out as a whole as well, with the tan on top and the white handle. That is also pretty useful outside the setting as well.</p>

<p>Overall, while three bucks might be a wee bit steep, I think this is a fantastic figure. Series 3 is far from my favorite series; but with that being said, I think some of its figures are pretty sweet. Like this one. He has an awesome hat, awesome bat, awesome torso, and awesome pants. I do think the head could&#39;ve had more detail, but that&#39;s just a minor problem. Also, there was another Baseball &quot;based&quot; minifigure in Series 10 (pun intended, ). While I do think that was a decent figure, I think this one is a bit better. And I think that wraps up this review! So if you found this helpful, check out my Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>

"AlkkuV","2022-02-05T14:07:24.83Z","Baseball Player.","<p>Hello guys, it&#39;s AlkkuV, back with another review. Today I&#39;m&nbsp;going to continue reviewing my minifigures. This one is the baseball player.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: Once again, just a basic series 3 bag and the booklet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure: So the baseball player is very similar to the series 10 baseball player, but comes with a baseball bat. The cap and the shirt are well printed, but the pants have almost nothing, just a belt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: This set comes with six parts, and I think all of them, but the baseball bat are unique.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: Just put the mini-fig together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete Build: Overall I like every figure from the minifigure series. They are fun to collect, but I think this is probably one of the most boring ones, but still I would give it a 4.6/5.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and stay toon for more reviews!</p>
