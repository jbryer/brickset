 minifigure can be used as a gorilla, or as a fairly accurate masquerade party suit. He is extremely cool, and even comes with a banana. Lets 
talk
 more about him.</p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"" class=""description"">Parts</h4>
<div class=""description"">
<ul><li>
<p>The Gorilla Suit Guy only has one interesting part, but thats good enough for most people. The ""Gorilla mask"" is EXTREMELY well made and almost looks like a real gorilla. Underneath is a sweating head, possibly because it is hot inside that gorilla suit? Apparently so. He has a nice furry gorilla body (with a zipper in the back). He also has a banana, which is nice as well.<br></p></li></ul></div>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"" class=""description"">Playability</h4>
<div class=""description"">
<ul><li>He is a great figure. Gorillas are awesome so he can be played with from the circus ring to the deep African jungles. Lots of fun with the gorilla!<br></li></ul></div>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Value</h4>
<ul><li>For TLG's $2.99 pricetag, this figure is definitely one of the better ones in this round. If you like animals, circuses, or just gorilla suit guys themselves this is a must have. He really is a great addition to any minifigure collection.</li></ul><h4>Overall</h4>
<ul><li>Overall, the Gorilla Suit Guy is a great figure that you will not regret buying. If you can find him go and get him right away!</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

But after I got a hand on the real item, I find that this minifig is the best one among others.<br><br>First, the details. The face shows some sweat, to give an impression that the minifig is feel very hot inside the costume. Also, when I put the gorilla mask into the head, the holes for the eyes in the mask really fit in with the position of the eyes. Really impressive.<br><br>Second, the extra item. You can get a banana for a set that cost around USD 3. It's quite cheap. Maybe you can create MOC fruit shop and put lots of bananas there?<br><br>In the end, I recommend you to grab at least one of this minifig, and I am really sure that you are going to love this one.<br><br>",TRUE,5,2,1,2,5
"Odeinoichus","2011-03-03T17:08:08.017Z","George, is that you?","<p>Set #8803 Gorilla Suit Guy: I'm not sure where this particular Mini-Figure fits, perhaps he's going to a costume party... Or you could use him as an actual Gorilla, but it would be a rather human-like Gorilla.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Mini-Figure has a torso that is double sided, the front is a Gorilla Chest and the back is a zipper. The mask piece is one of the most detailed looking pieces I've ever seen as a head mask, it reminds me of the Werewolf from the Studios set I used to own. Underneath the Gorilla mask is a face covered in sweat and looking decidedly uncomfortable. He must have been wearing his costume for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Included with him is the new banana piece. It compliments his costume form nicely though. With the newly revealed 'Dinosaur Suit Guy' in Series 5, or perhaps it's LEGO Godzilla, we have two Mini-Figures that are outside the norm. In point of fact these two are so unique I'd recommend them on that principal alone. There's really little that could improve him, he is one stellar figure.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4

This is a very cool minifig! The look of the gorilla suit is convincing as the mask is very well made. So well made in fact, that you can see the minifig's eyes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">through</span> the eye holes in the mask. Considering how tiny the scale is, I find that amazing.<br><br>This was my first collectible minifigure and if the rest of them live up to this level of quality and creativity I will be very pleased to own them all.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-03-06T19:14:24.773Z","Is it a man or a gorilla? Or a mangilla?","The Gorilla Suit guy is a minifigure who some believe that he thinks he is a gorilla, and others believe he is lost on the way to a party. Either way, it doesn't matter, because this figure is pretty cool. Almost everything on the figure is new- the gorilla mold, the torso, and the head, which happens to be quite sweaty. This minifigure also comes with a banana, which I found pretty cool as I only have like, 1 or 2 of them. The amount of coolness on this fig is at 11.5 on a scale of 1 to 10. The sweaty head I find to be one of the coolest LEGO heads, and the actual costume of the ape is pretty cool too. And this fig was 2.99? It should be 5.99 for all the value in it! Overall, a fantastic figure. Pick it up if you get the chance.",FALSE,5,5,1,3,5
"AETerry","2011-03-30T17:48:12.657Z","Gorilla Suit Guy Review","<p>I wasn't sure at first about this minifigure, but now that I have my hands on 3 of them... I'm rather amused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The back of the minifigure shows a zipper, clearly illustrating that this is indeed a Gorilla suit and the minifigure's head is sweating I presume from how hot it is wearing the suit and Gorilla head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He's holding a bananna, which seems to be an excuse to give the guy something to hold for an accessory. The detailing is very good for this set and there's an endless variety of MOCs and scenes you could come up with for this minifigure.... Gorillas in the Mist Lego movie, Costume party, Mascot.... Car Dealer Ship and minis coming in ""Great Gorilla Costume! We think we'll buy a car!"" and so on.</p>

<p>Well worth getting, especially discovering that after buying a few packages, I've got three of them.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,4
"clundsberg","2011-06-10T02:37:12.203Z","What's drunk, sweaty, has a banana and wears a gorilla suit?","<p>The correct answer is Me, but in this case we'll let it slide and say its this Gorilla Suit Guy.</p>
<p>This LEGO mini is PURE GENIUS!&nbsp; From the way the eyes line up with the holes in the gorilla mask to the zipper in the back of the suit,&nbsp;it's one well thought out mini.&nbsp; The ultimate kicker being the sweaty, unhappy LEGO character revealed within when you lift the mask off; this mini should be an auto-sought-after mini from the get go.&nbsp; After all, who doesn't want a guy in a gorilla suit representing *anything* in LEGO ville?</p>
<p>This guy is not the easiest to find when molesting LEGO bags of the season three variety:&nbsp; The banana being the easiest item to grope is still small enough to make this a frustrating, yet worthy find.&nbsp; The uniqueness of this character is outstanding. The mask alone is something to behold in the LEGO world and ironically the item you feel for (banana) is the most common piece of this LEGO mini.</p>
<p>Sure it's an easy build as most figures are, but it's a mini you'll be ecstatic to find as well as&nbsp;one of the best out there.&nbsp; LEGO hit the proverbial nail on the head with the costumed series (the next being Godzilla Guy - S5) and I cannot recommend this one enough.&nbsp; Well worth me making a fool of myself at a MicroCenter for. (yes for some reason they have LEGOS there, just ask the Roguish one) An overall well-detailed figure that you'll love, guarenteed.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

"SuperBrixBros","2017-09-22T00:38:08.02Z","Nice Little Costume","<p>Got this about seven years ago and it&#39;s still a great minifig.</p>

<p>Legs: Average black legs and hips</p>

<p>Torso: Black with black arms and dark bluish grey hands. Printing on the front shows a fat grey monkey chest and some fuzzy detailing around the sides.</p>

<p>Head: Shows eyes and mouth with an uncomfortable expression and sweat trickling down the sides. Clearly this minifig doesn&#39;t like his job as a mascot... person... thingy... Whatever he&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>Headgear: Moulded monkey mask with eyeholes and printing showing a grey face with a nose an mouth on the front. Moulded creases around the back show wrinkles in the costume.</p>

<p>Accessory: Yellow banana</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all! Thanks!</p>

"FearlessSword","2017-08-20T22:36:42.737Z","Gorilla Suit Guy","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gorilla Suit guy was the first of a long series of characters inside of suits, and in my opinion, still remains the best. The printing is simple, but clearly shows that whatever minifigure wearing the suit is clearly some sort of primate. The inclusion of the Banana is also a nice touch, as I am always open to more parts for my collection. The face underneath is also quite humorous and I like it. Now, after owning this figure for a few years, the grey outline on the mask has sort of worn away and turned black as it is only printed, but that is to be expected from a figure that has been &quot;played well with.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I highly recommend this figure as a collectable to add to your collection.&nbsp;</p>

"sideswinger","2020-08-24T01:52:45.86Z","A pretty COOL figure!","<p>So the twelfth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 3 is the Gorilla Suit Guy, and he&#39;s a pretty cool figure. He was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6&nbsp;pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>So starting him off, we have that mask piece which might be my favorite part of the figure. It was new for the figure, which is cool, and it looks really awesome. I love the shaping on the sides, with the ears and all, and I also like how they did the front in gray. If I had to guess, I&#39;d say it isn&#39;t dual-moulded but rather printed, which is common for its time.&nbsp;Overall,&nbsp;I just love&nbsp;how the piece came together as a whole.</p>

<p>Then we have his face, which might also be my favorite part of the figure. I think the printing on that came out looking fantastic. It is an extremely useful print, with the sort of worried look, as well as the drips of sweat. If you&#39;re considering buying this dude online, I would google pics of the face underneath, because it looks really sweet.</p>

<p>Then we have his torso, which does have some more cool printing. I really like how they captured the fuzzy tummy, and I just think LEGO did a good job with it overall. But then there&#39;s something else that&#39;s very awesome: back torso printing. Back printing was very rare with CMF&#39;s in Series 1, 2, and 3, so it&#39;s great to see it here. And it is just that zipper, which is such a fun and creative detail.</p>

<p>And since his legs are plain black with no printing, let&#39;s talk about his accessory, which is just that banana piece. Nothing new or exclusive with that since it is a pretty old piece. So while it isn&#39;t special, it&#39;s generous of LEGO to give us an accessory at all, and for that, I&#39;m thankful.</p>

<p>Overall, I would give this dude a four-star rating. I think the figure itself is pretty awesome, from the mask to the face. You might be wondering why I gave him a 4 and not a 5. Well, while I think this dude looks good, I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s worth three dollars. But I guess the current price for CMF&#39;s at the time of this review is way worse than it was in 2011. 5 dollars a pack is terrible.</p>

<p>Anyways, I think that wraps up this review! So if you found this helpful, check out my Series 1, 2, and 3 reviews, and I do hope this helped you decide if you wanted to pay the steep price of twenty bucks on Ebay. Ouch. And thank you for reading!</p>
