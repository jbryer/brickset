"BobaFett2","2010-12-11T11:42:46.4Z","It's a free robot! And an awesome one too!","<p>I was going to the Mall of America on the grand opening day. The store was to open at 11:00, and most other things in a wide area around it were closed. Little did I know that a shortcut I took would save me from the pain of not getting one of these-I barely made it in time (at 10:10) and was person #300 (the first 300 in line were given wristbands, and if you had one, they would give you a robot (or if you had multiple people, enough robots for each who had effectively spent 35 dollars). So after waiting approx. 50 minutes and another 45 in line, I got in. Needless to say, I rushed to get the set I wanted (Emerald Night) while I gave my brother 20 dollars to which he added his own 20, and bought the Cursed Cobra Statue and the Seabed Strider, then rushing to the line just in case they ran out too early....so we got two robots, and a free Pick-A-Brick box (that makes two). The robot represents the HUGE robot at the store, which is now the largest LEGO &quot;creation&quot; in the world. Some pictures of the Robot can be seen in the <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bobafett2/sets/72157625531284250/"">Grand Opening MN folder</a> in my FlickR photostream.

<h4>Building</h4>
<p>Well, it's not the most complex build-however, for a set that contains 125 pieces, it was probably my favorite. It uses a bunch of cheese slopes and SNOT bricks to make the robot. There were some techniques I hadn't used in sets before, and the result looked decent.<p>
<h4>Value for Money</h4>
<p>It's free-it's just that good. 125 parts free seems like a great deal to me. I had to spend 35 dollars, but hey-I got a free set, and I was planning on getting a 100 dollar set anyways.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>One of the best points of this set is the parts. It has a large number of cheese slopes in blue, black, and orange (always need more of those). It has a lot of SNOT bricks (1x1 with studs on the top and all four sides), some angled bricks, a few robot joint bricks, and a few basic bricks.</p>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p>The set is simple and very good. It has a great design, albeit a simple one, and it really does look similar to the robot.</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>The set fails for playability, but only because it's not meant for it. It's a grand opening exclusive, and sadly, when you play around with things connected by only by a 1x1 brick, they tend to pull apart.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Cheese Slopes</li>
    <li>Orange and Blue (dark blue is much more common than blue nowadays)</li>
    <li>Comes with 125 parts and is free (that's a part value of 0 cents per part, for those of you doing the math)</li>
    <li>It's surprisinly similar to the full-scale robot</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Not playable</li>
    <li>Rare</li>
    <li>Sword one back isn't the right color and comes off</li>
</ul>
<p>There isn't anything bad I can say about it-I love the set. I've seen better, but for 125 parts it's a great deal.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,5
