"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-12-31T16:39:12.587Z","Perfect on every level","At last, Lego has finally released another bank. This is the third bank in the history of the City/Town theme. To my knowledge, the previous banks had average to poor reception; 1490 released in 1990 has an average rating of 2.9/5, and 6566 released in 1997 has an average rating of 3.3/5. Luckily, this is quite a decent bank, and I will explain why shortly.<br><br>The build to this set is fairly straightforward; there is nothing fancy or challenging. You can enjoy your set after a build time of about an hour.<br><br>To begin with, this set includes four minifigures: a robber, police officer, bank teller, and security guard/van driver. Accessories include a crowbar, two money pieces, two gold pieces, two safes, burlap sack, four green suitcases, dolly, and walkie-talkie. Vehicles include a security van, police cruiser, and motorcycle (with new design). The van stores the two safes and four suitcases, and there are doors on the left, right, and rear of the van which allow access to its interior. The roof of the van can also be taken off to play inside it.<br><br>I was extremely impressed with how much detail the bank has. The exterior of the bank has two ""BANK"" signs, an ATM, an alarm (to the extreme right), a sun roof, and a pipe where the robber escapes. The overall design of the bank is aesthetically pleasing, and the colour scheme of yellow, grey, and navy blue is very nice. The building is modular; you can take the second floor off.<br><br>When you enter the bank, the first floor has a flower pot, chair, desk with computer, clock, cabinet, cup, and a small red shelf where papers are stored. <br><br>The second floor is very interesting. This is the actual vault room where money and gold are stored. Here, there is a vault door, and behind the door is a shelf for the money and gold. Lastly, there is another flower pot identical to the one on the first floor. The robber enters/escapes the bank via the opening sun roof and the pipe located on the left side of the bank.<br><br>Overall, this is an excellent set worth buying. It is nice how Lego has released another bank. I'm slightly disappointed with the price though. At $64.99 CAD, it can be slightly cheaper. Other than that, I am very satisfied and I suggest all City fans get it as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"SgtSmash","2011-01-11T16:48:47.883Z","This is a good place for a stick up! ","<p>The Bank &amp; Money Transfer&nbsp;is a cool little set, packed with a ton of features, play value, rare brick pieces, and is a welcome addition, perhaps long overdue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a good time building this set with my daughter, and the build didn't take very long, maybe an hour or so at best. I really enjoy the end result, with the bank building of course being my favorite part. I was really impressed with the color selection and overall design that Lego put into it. While the building isn't all that large, it seems to follow the current trend of narrow yet tall two-story buildings (ala City Corner) that can easily fit just about anywhere in your town without the need to re-arrange road/base plates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer downstairs even&nbsp;has a different screen&nbsp;for once, and the design of the safe upstairs was well thought out. I like the gold bricks, and the cash that is included. The skylight is a decent feature as well. Interestingly enough is the ATM machine out front which detaches from the building, and only sits in the space provided. The clock for the interior is on the other side of the machine, so if you&nbsp;take out the ATM, you get the clock too. My assumption is that this floating design&nbsp;is for when the robber(s) try to jack the ATM machine and rip it out of the wall.&nbsp;Did&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lego designers see one too many episodes of COPS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bank teller has the same outfit included in a few recent sets, like the Grand Emporium, but appears to have a new braided hair design. The burglar comes with a cool backpack, with room to stuff cash and gold bricks, and also comes with&nbsp;a red crowbar, to match his red motorbike(?).&nbsp;I would have maybe&nbsp;colored the crowbar differently, as it is reminiscent of a snake, but I digress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The police car seems to be a station wagon design, but there is no backseat. It would have been a welcome feature had Lego designed the police car&nbsp;like the taxi which comes with the City Train Station #7937, with room for a backseat for the burglar to sit in after getting apprehended. The security van&nbsp;was&nbsp;well thought out, with slots for the money bags, as well as two safes and ""sliding"" doors which I don't think I've seen before. I really like the new powder blue police outfit which the security guard is wearing too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a side note, there's been quite a bit of speculation and not a whole lot of news about what the next Modular Building will be. Some were hoping it would be a bank, but I guess&nbsp;that question has now&nbsp;been answered. Although it never stopped Lego from creating the ""Fire Brigade"" building, despite there being an existing Fire Station...but my guess is that the next mod building will be a post office, or perhaps a Hospital? Not sure, but that would be cool. Hopefully it will be something that hasn't been&nbsp;offered yet. &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Naylus","2011-01-13T13:30:53.63Z","Brick-Banking!","<p>It is possible, that set #3661 is another reminder of old good Lego City sets, released many years ago. A small building with yellow walls looks simple enough, but still pretty detailed.</p>
<p><strong>The Building:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The <em>ground floor</em> includes a hallway with a chair, a plant pot and a modern desk (with alarm button) for the bank employee. One of the interesting details is the computer, though it was released with other sets before. Outside is the banking terminal, that can be destroyed/removed/wrenched out by the burglars or... anyone who, as You believe, could do that.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>The <em>first floor</em> also includes the plant pot, as well as a large safe with golden plates. I really like the glass ceiling here, that also acts as a &quot;door&quot; for the uninvited guests. A nice addition to the playability actually. Some details have pictures and don't use stickers here. Both floors have tubes, that a burglar can climb up to get to the Bank.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Transport:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The <em>police car</em> is not much special, but still a very good addition to your City if You don't have one. However it uses plenty of stickers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>The <em>large van</em> looks just awesome. It has two vaults, that can be removed from the car, as well as a special depository for the four (4) green suitcases (and a red cart for them).</li>
</ul>
<p>#3661 has a very nice selection of <strong>Minifigs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>A Bank Employee</em> - a nice lady with brown hair from Prince of Persia Lego series. Looks good, no doubt.</li>
    <li><em>A Bank Security Officer -</em> with blue uniform and white cap.</li>
    <li><em>A Police Officer </em>- You are already familiar with him.</li>
    <li><em>A Burglar</em> - the guy with a crowbar and a bag with Lego currency...</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words - the set is really diverse in details and ideas for both games and building. The Bank would fit perfectly into any street of your Lego Town.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4

<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>The Police Car<br></span> <br>The police car is a nice and simple car that provides another variant to the many different types of police vehicles present.

The Armored Car is designed very will and comes with a hand-truck to transport either the four green suitcases provided or the two safes provided. The Armored Car comes with two side doors and a back door which along with the two removable roof sections provides easy access to the interior of the vehicle.<br>The only complaint that I have about armored car is the minifigure provided to be the guard/driver.

The Bank is two stories and comes with multiple detail parts including a computer keyboard and screen on the first floor and a vault on the second floor. The vault door may be a bit fragile for the younger owners. The Bank provides a ""storm drain"" on the side for the Crooks to climb up the side of the bank and there is a hatch on the roof that allows the Crooks access to the vault on the second floor.

"av8r1973","2011-01-15T09:47:42.917Z","Finally - a great looking bank with loads of playability!","After seeing this in the 2011 release announcement, it immediately went on my wish list. &nbsp;We found it online in Taiwan for about the US retail price, so we picked it up. &nbsp;My 3yo daughter built the cop car, my 5yo daughter built the bank by herself, and I built the armored car when they lost interest (attention span of a snow pea).<div><br></div><div>The color selection was thought out very well. &nbsp;The navy blue bricks are a sharp contrast to the typical primary colors, and it could really be a bank's scheme. &nbsp;The yellow elements are tastefully mixed in with lots of ""glass"" to make it a very modern building. &nbsp;The color scheme carries through to the armored car, as does a new logo to the City theme (as far as I can tell).</div><div><br></div><div>Bank: Other reviews already discussed the bank in pretty good detail. &nbsp;Standard 2-story structure with an open back. &nbsp;No new elements here, but the elements are all useful. &nbsp;The desk downstairs with a modern computer and coffee cup share the floor space with a potted plant. &nbsp;I would like to have seen the ficus tree that came with the Town Plan used here, rather than the standard flowers, but it may have taken too much floor space. &nbsp;The ATM outside is a nice touch, though it's not held in enough to withstand a blow to the building by a daughter's foot. &nbsp;It does allow the included crook to steal it more easily.</div><div><br></div><div>Upstairs is a very nicely designed vault door. &nbsp;The mounting method is a bit flimsy, but we'll see how it holds up (standard antenna with no upper support) &nbsp;The vault stores the gold bricks (like the one that came with the 7288 Mobile Police Unit) and the cash. &nbsp;Nice use of anchor bricks to give the appearance of more cash.</div><div><br></div><div>Police Car: Standard white car with blue stickers. &nbsp;Not much to discuss here. &nbsp;Though it looks like a station wagon, it must be a rear-engine one, as there is no storage in the back. &nbsp;It would have been nice to find a place to put the included handheld radio.</div><div><br></div><div>Armored Car: Besides the cool looking bank, this is the star of the set. &nbsp;It's an incredibly sturdy 6-lug wide truck with great proportions and realistic details. &nbsp;Both sides have swing-up panels that expose storage for two safes. &nbsp;The back opens for access to 4 bays for the included green cash suitcases. &nbsp;Both 6x6 flat top panels easily come off to allow access inside, too. &nbsp;The minifig is really a police torso with back printing. &nbsp;A second security minifig would have been nice, since most armored cars have at least two guards.</div><div><br></div><div>Crook: &nbsp;He was a standard crook wearing his prison stripes, but he rides a dirt bike for a getaway vehicle! &nbsp;Cool, now I can have real motorcycle chases with the other police motorcycles.</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: I can see some armored truck heists in the near future, along with the bank robberies with this great addition to the City theme. &nbsp;The two minor nits noted above aren't even worth reporting as a con, so I can't see any cons within this set. The price is a bit higher than I expected, but there are a lot of features and ingenious build techniques to compensate. &nbsp;Highly recommended.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4

As far as rare pieces are concerned, the set is complete with three green suitcases, an open back pack, gray 1x4 pieces which are flat in the middle and studded on each end, and an oddity that appears to be a combo between a a 1x2 and a slanted flat piece. The set is divided into four bags with three instructions. The first set is for the police car and and the bike, the second set for the armored car, and the third for the bank itself. I suppose the instructions are somehow meant to make the build easier, but for me it's a pain because I'll have to search for multiple instructions for one set if a particular part is broken.<div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>There isn't much to say about the police car other than it's the usual mundane build. The armored car is thankfully unique with a row of panels in the back to store the suitcases. The middle of the car is a storage for two disappointingly empty safes. The robber is also lacking in loot. Instead of &nbsp;two bank notes being included in his pouch, one bill is attached to a studded piece of the same size. As for the bank itself, it's structurally sound. The bottom floor has a chair, a flower pot, a desk with a computer, and a cabinet with a paper storage on top. The top floor also has a flower pot and the vault which contains two shelves, only one of which has gold. The roof has a raising sky light which can be accessed by the side of the building via pipe.

"AETerry","2011-05-17T14:35:40.193Z","Bank & Money Transfer Review","<p>I've been chomping at the bit wanting to get this set and&nbsp;I knew it was over at my local Target, but it's taken a bit to feel I've the money, time and I finally decided to just order it from LEGO.com for the VIP points. Well worth the time I think and just a beautiful set to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Berrybrick's Review has a list of all the bank sets that LEGO has done over the year, there's more of them then I give credit for. But then I've only been counting the LEGO Bank set 1490 (yr. 1990) and then Bank set 6566 (yr. 1997) as proper Bank sets for a Lego Town or City. The others were for another theme or just a facade front that didn't really count.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those on a budget and can't afford those huge $150 modular Town sets... this Bank set offers a far more affordable buy and build with a lot of good details to it, inside and outside. I'm just surprised by all the little details put into this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is also broken down so it's like you're building three different models. Starting off first with the Police Vehicle, a welcomed addition to the 2011 Police theme and sets I want to pick up for this year. Then it's the Armored Car which is better then another Armored Car set I got to go along with my Bank set 6566. It holds 4 green suit cases of money, 2 large safes and then it's dolley for transporting those pieces around with. The top of the Armored Car easily lifts off in two parts so you can get pieces in and out of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final build is the bank itself with all of it's detail work and stickers, yes stickers. Love them or hate them, they are part of this set. My only complaint is that that the gold credit card piece, I'd have had printed instead of placing a sticker on it. The rest is fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4 Minifigures in all fill out this set, the Police Officer, the Bank Teller, the Armored Car Driver and then the Crook with his red motorcylce who climbs up a pole on the side of the bank and can get away for a speed chase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's just plenty and lots that can be done with this set for a City scene. I love it and am glad I was finally able to get around to getting it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"stagus","2011-04-05T03:33:30.963Z","Nice City addition","<p>Slightly different angle for this review as I am an adult collector and city builder.&nbsp; The build is a nice one.&nbsp; The van is excellent with safes inside as well as the secure compartment for the suitcases (loaded with banking bonds no doubt).&nbsp; It sits well within a city.&nbsp; My main street has 4 of the modular builds so this is a good building to have as a lead out from the city centre due to it being two storey.&nbsp; The best point about the police car is that it is 'number 6' so when the police helicopter is following the pursuit it is easily identifiable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For younger builders I would think there is plenty of playablility.&nbsp; Gold to be stolen from the vault....climb up the drain pipe to access the roof.....enter via glass panel or you could hijack the van and make off on the motorbike with the police in hot pursuit or you could crowbar the cash machine, etc, etc.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nice build 
<li>Good city addition 
<li>Loads of playabilty 
<li>The security van is excellent

"Berrus_Brickus","2011-02-12T11:32:58.09Z","Hold 'em up!","<p>I ordered this from LEGO.com with the <em>Seabed&nbsp;Strider</em> and a couple handfuls&nbsp;of Collectable Minifigures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the&nbsp;seventh LEGO bank as far as I can tell, here are the others:</p>
<ul>
<li>1490 LEGO Bank (1990)-TOWN 
<li>4608 Bank Breakout (2001)-Jack Stone 
<li>4714 Gringott's Bank (2001)-Harry Potter 
<li>4854 Doc Ock's Bank Robbery (2004)-Spiderman 
<li>6566 Bank (1997)-TOWN 
<li>1376 Spiderman Action Studio (2002)-Studios 
<li>10217 Diagon Alley (2011)-Harry Potter 
<li></li></ul>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The first thing that I noticed about the box is that it was a lot shorter and wider than boxes for sets of this size (like <em>Hagrid's Hut </em>for you HP fans).&nbsp; On the front of the box we get and image similar to the instructions, just a lot larger and with a <em>limited/special</em> edition banner.</p>
<p>There are three instruction booklets, one for the police car and motor-bike, one for the armored car, and lastly, one for the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did find one actual mistake in the instructions.&nbsp; When building the armored car, it calls for a blue 1x4 beam, but it shows it in dark blue on one page.</p>
<p>That was the only actual mistake, but some of you might think of these as mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the last steps of building the armored car is to insert the two gray safes (or saves?), however on the last page of the book, we see them outside of the truck 
<li>On the horizontal bank sign, it only tells you to apply one sticker</li></ul>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set has 405 pieces for $50 which isn't bad because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The car and motor-bike themselves would be about $10, the armored a car about $15, and the bank about $30 
<li>It is limited edition 
<li>We get quite a few extra pieces!</li></ul>
<p>Most of the parts are <strong>not </strong>printed.&nbsp; For printed parts we have a new computer screen, a darkstone QWERTY keyboard, two $100 bills, and a clock.&nbsp; I won't really complain about the stickers as they are fairly easy to apply, with the exception of the lisence plates.&nbsp; I do wish that we could get the POLICE sticker printed next time as it is used very much in Police sets (so in about every other set ;) ).</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p><strong>The Officer:</strong> Standard black legs, average CITY Police torso (I thought that sombody said somthing about new backprinting!), a new face showing a large chin and a strange facial expression (kind of looks like he had an accident to me), and another white officer cap.&nbsp; Fine except for the face.</p>
<p><strong>The Bank Teller:</strong> Light gray legs, new gray female jacket w/ a purple scarf and pale pink shirt sticking out, New opened mouth female face (finally, they stopped using Mary Jane's!), and Tasmina's hairpiece.&nbsp; She is perfect, except for Tasmina's hair. . . .</p>
<p><strong>The Bank Transport Agent: </strong>Dark blue legs, new light blue police detective torso (w/ POLICE backprinting), a face w/ a brown beard, glasses and slightly crossed eyes, he also has the mini U.S. cap in a slightly new mould.&nbsp; Fine except for the face.</p>
<p><strong>The Criminal</strong>: Dark gray legs, same-old crook torso piece, new face with a brown stubble moustache, and a wide open mouth, and a standard&nbsp;black knit cap.&nbsp; I actually hated this figure at first, but he became my favorite of the batch because he reminds me of Brickster's idiotic, cross-eyed henchmen!</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Not sure how long it took me, probably 50-min, give-or-take.&nbsp; The build is simple enough and doesn't really use any new building techniques except for the ATM removal and I haven't seen the way that they placed the sign in an official set before.&nbsp; My only complaint is that when building the armored car (a lot of the problems seem to be with this!), whel building the racks, they are supported with a bunch of random red and yellow pieces. It's fine though because after the truck is completed, only two of the yellow bricks are still visible and only when the doors are opened.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>A perfect expansion for the <em>City Corner </em>set which is a great set dedicated to everyday CITY life (which is becoming more common with LEGOs!).&nbsp; The bank is a little smaller than I though, but that's fine.&nbsp; It is still larger than the bus stop and skate shop, it's about the same size as the Pizzaria, which makes the scene look much better as before the restaurant towered over the other two buildings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One complaint is that the crook's escape pole has to be turned 90 degrees to the right, otherwise the Bank must end the street.</p>
<p>The playability of this set is great, we have a bank,&nbsp;a POLICE car (I actually needed another one), a crook on a motor-bike, and three things for the notorius criminal to attack, the ATM, the safe, and the armored truck.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>All&nbsp;in all, a great set! Oh sure there were a few problems with it, mostly on the armored car, but I love it anyways!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the note of the list, I can say that it is better than the others because-</p>
<ul>
<li>The Harry Potter ones aren't usable 
<li>The Spiderman ones are basically backdrops 
<li>The Jackstone one is overly juniorized 
<li>The TOWN ones are out of date</li></ul>
<p>So yeah, get it if you're into CITY.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

","<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; ""><div style=""background-color: transparent; ""><span id=""internal-source-marker_0.48422131105326116"" style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">Between LEGO’s fixation with innumerable colossal police stations that would bring a tear to Joseph Stalin’s eye and harbour/marina sets that look good but I personally never buy because I would find them awkward to display (nothing else would be able to go on the side of the set that’s supposed to be “water”), the LEGO city sometimes finds itself a little lacking in civilian buildings that aren’t geared towards turning the town into an Orwellian dystopia. 2009’s City Corner (7641) went a long way towards boosting the local economy, and now we have a fantastic bank that not only looks good but counterbalances the police state that LEGO gets closer towards every year. True enough, Bank &amp; Money Transfer is indeed classified under the “Police” subtheme and does feature a police car and police officer, but it’s a far cry from being an all-out “Police” set in the same way that the frightening Mobile Police Unit (7288) is. Seriously, you’ve got a problem when one of those starts rolling through town on a Sunday morning. </span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">But enough about the failure of liberalism in LEGO city. Bank &amp; Money Transfer comes with four Minifigs and a handful of great vehicles in addition to the bank building itself. Four Minifigs is definitely a great boon to any city display, but one can’t help but wonder why a businessman was not included as part of the count, although it is no great loss as you can get one with the Small Car (3177), City Minifig Collection (8401), or, heck, even Tripod Invader (7051). </span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">I had never been particularly interested in city vehicles before, but the ones included in this set went a long way in changing my mind. The motorcycle is a standard build and nothing to crow about, but the police car and the armored car are absolutely great, and particular mention has to be given to the armored car, which not only looks good but has fantastic amount of utility to it as well. The safes and money carriers fit snugly in designated compartments at the back of the truck, and the whole design gives it a very sturdy feel that is completely appropriate for a vehicle that carried thousands of dollars in it on a routine basis. The driver Minifig is also very cool, dressed to look more like a rent-a-cop than in the serious black that the “real” police officers in LEGO city wear. I’ll bet you anything that he’s only three weeks from retirement, too.</span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">The bank itself is also no slouch, both in terms of display and in terms of playability. At the front, there is an ATM whose panel is completely removable (not sure why), and the sleekness of the whole design is just gorgeous, setting it clearly apart from the less serious storefronts like those in City Corner but also much friendlier than any police station. Inside the bank is a reception counter and waiting room on the first floor and a safe on the second floor that’s perfect for recreating the Dr. Octopus robbery scene from Spider-Man 2 (but only with the appropriate Minifigs, of course). As with many city sets, Bank &amp; Money Transfer has no shortage of stickers that you need to apply, but fortunately the only one that requires much of a steady hand is the vertical one that goes on the front sign. </span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ""></span><br><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; "">The paucity of civilian buildings makes this set immediately attractive to city builders, but this set - with its myriad of vehicles and features - also makes it great for kids who actually play with their LEGO (imagine that). I suppose it’s a bit too much to hope for an office or other buildings to round out the town, but this set goes a very long way into bringing any city alive. </span></div></span>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"phipfwe76","2011-05-13T18:33:19.253Z","A great set","<p>I had to get the City Bank the second I first saw it. It's a very unique (and perfect) addition to any city. The bank is a nice yellow which helps it stand out from the other buildings, and comes with a police car and very nice money truck. The build was pretty basic, aside from the money truck which is different and can carry a safe inside. The bank itself has an ATM out front and a counter for the teller, along with the big safe on the second floor. This set also comes with a cop and a criminal, which&nbsp;I think has been played out. My city is over-run by tons of each. Would've preferred the pieces for the cop car would've went to adding a drive-thru lane or something. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I love this set as every city has a bank and this one is very eye pleasing in my opinion. Fantastic addition to the City.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4

We have finally got a Bank, something you need in the LEGO City Police Sets; So this means the Robbers have finally got somewhere to rob; Because the past there have never been anyway for the Robbers to rob. The set comes with: A Police Officer,&nbsp;City Bank&nbsp;Van Driver, Banker, Robber with a Crow Bar,&nbsp;the Unit 6 Police Car of all the 2011 Police Sets, the&nbsp;City Bank Money Transportation Van, a Motorbike for the Robber, City Bank building, lots of Money and Gold and 4 Green Bags of Money. Loads of great features in the this, (just been listed). The worst thing about this set is that it's a Special Edition Set, so it's Hard-to-Find but this one is not so bad because it's Exclusive to lego.com and Argos; I got this set from Argos. I am also thinking&nbsp;of getting the LEGO City Police 3648 Police Chase Special Edition&nbsp;Set, but you can only get it from lego.com!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

The piece colors are great, there are a good amount of sticks. The Bike is neat too and the Thief have a backpack to put the stolen cash :P. The Safe is Awesome and the place you put the cash and gold is neat too.<br>Here on Brasil lego is VERY expensive, like 3-5 times more expensive than US. But i got a 50% discount on this set so pay only 90 Reais (~51 US Dollars today), but this was the only one i got with same price as USA, others are much expensive.<br>The only little thing i did liked very much are the big pieces of the bank wall, i would prefer if they came with a bit more smaller pieces.<br><br>Sorry my english :)<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Tyler_James","2012-11-16T21:40:18.93Z","In a Lego City of cops and robbers, it makes sense to have a bank...","<p>I picked this set up in the Lego store in NYC back in 2010, and I was pretty excited to finally get it because a lot of stores were running out. &nbsp;I think with tax it came out to be something like USD $65, which in my mind is a little too much for what you get here. &nbsp;That said, there is a lot to like about this set, but I would recommend trying to find it used or discounted for something closer to 40 or 50, if that&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>Building Experience</p>

<p>This was an enjoyable set to put together, I especially liked the the armored truck and the way the bank was built. &nbsp;When I was younger I really hated sets that limited your ability to play inside of them, so the fact that the top floor comes off easily is great. &nbsp;Of course the more logical side of me always wondered how Lego people were supposed to get to that second floor without ladders or stairs, but I digress. &nbsp;Each element of the set (armored truck, police car, each floor of the bank) came in a separate bag and with instructions, so that certainly makes it easier. &nbsp;But as far as Lego sets go, this was not a hard one to put together or an especially surprising build in any way. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>One of the redeeming features of this set is the abundance of useful pieces, including the green suitcases, gold &quot;bars,&quot; money tiles, and the bank teller/armored truck driver minifigs. I also am a big fan of the bike the robber. &nbsp;The stickers included aren&#39;t too obtrusive; I did choose to not put any on the van or police car, but that&#39;s just me. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability</p>

<p>This is probably one of the more &quot;playable&quot; sets I&#39;ve purchased in the past couple years. &nbsp;Having the pipe and roof opening for the bandit, in addition to the removable second floor, really makes the bank an interactive building. &nbsp;Also, you get three vehicles, and while you probably don&#39;t need another police car, I thought this one was kind of cool looking (maybe a little more European? &nbsp;I don&#39;t know though). &nbsp;It&#39;s hard for me to really evaluate playability with a lot of sets because I look for different things now, but I can say without a doubt this is a good choice if playability is important to you.</p>

<p>Value for Money</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, I paid a total of USD 65 for this set. &nbsp;I think that&#39;s far too high, but that is also the premium you end up paying when you are impulse shopping in NYC around Christmas. &nbsp;But even at 50 (the current MSRP), I am hesitant to say this is a great value. &nbsp;The cop and robber minifigs are not too valuable in my mind, and while there are some neat pieces, it just does not feel like a $50 set. &nbsp;However, it makes a good addition to any existing city, and while I feel I paid too much, I am still glad I have it. &nbsp;Definitely one of the better Lego City themed sets put out recently.</p>

"middleton83","2013-01-04T10:53:23.92Z","The Bank that gives out money","<p>This set is a must have, I have seen no flaws in its amazing design. In the set you get a Police car (No. 6, which fits in with the rest of the 2011 police range), a red dirtbike (for the robber), a money truck (which carries all the money) and of course the bank (with a safe).</p>
<p>Now I will talk about each sub-build individually.</p>
<p>The first sub-build, which built the police car and dirtbike, with police officer and robber. The car was a really nice build as it has a little shelf behind the police officer (Personally somehwere to put his radio when he's driving), the dirtbike was a standard dirt bike build. The robber who has a rucksack&nbsp;has already stolen 2 bits of money (Though for some reason not already in the bank) looks a bit dim, but if he can rob a bank by himself, that's very imprssive, the police officer is a standard build with all police sets.</p>
<p>The second sub-build built the moeny truck, and security guard person. The truck is amazing, it could be used for so much more than money. The only downside to the truck is the holes at the sides of the wheels (Very hard to see), you don't want the money geting wet.</p>
<p>The third and final sub-build is the bank with bank worker. The bank has been laid out really well, and there isnt a cramped feel like other buildings. The ATM / Cash machine is a really nice feature, and because of how it is built it aslo means if the robber was to take it away, he would get a free clock. The safe is massive as it covers about half of the upper floor space. the robber can eneter the bank from a pipe on the side of the building and the roof. </p>
<p>Pros </p>
<ul>
<li>3 vehicles 
<li>4 minifigures 
<li>Well built bank 
<li>The playability features</li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>The price is a bit steep, but deffinetly worth it 
<li>No managers office</li></ul>
<p>Now the final thing you should know is, Where did the criminal get the red dirtbike? He could have stolen it, but there are no places to buy dirtbikes in Lego City, perhaps it was imported. Only time will tell where he obtained it from.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Hobbythom","2012-11-27T16:42:34.63Z","A must have for City lovers","<p>This set is without a doubt one of my favourite sets ever. You get a good amount of bricks for your money which build up in to three models (not counting the motor bike). I will give a short description of each.</p>

<p><b>Police car</b></p>

<p>This is actually the only thing I&#39;m not a really big fan of. It just seems a bit long for a small car. But I guess for those who don&#39;t have a lot of policecars or the kids who prefer playability it&#39;s a decent catch. For me personally, &nbsp;a normal car with a potential customer for the bank would have been nice.</p>

<p><b>Armoured Truck</b></p>

<p>Simply put a wonderful model. It looks heavy, sturdy and carries a respectable amount of loot for the crook. It&#39;s build up from a lot of parts. Furthermore, it could be stripped down to a wonderful template for any kind of delivery van.</p>

<p><b>The bank</b></p>

<p>The bank looks the part from the outside. It really is a sturdy construction which gives it a nice, tall and office-like look. Just like you&#39;d expect from a bank.&nbsp;<span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"">inside you&#39;ll find lots of details and great playability.</span></p>
