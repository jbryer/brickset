"bmwlego","2011-08-26T09:38:58.917Z","Lights, Camera, Action! The only thing missing is a ticket to mail to the driver of the red car!","I wasn't to keen on buying this set because I've fallen victim to the sneaky Red Light Cameras and I wasn't sure I wanted to build a set depicting this. However, it is quite funny when it happens in LEGO!<br><br>Both cars in this set are similarly designed and look great. I enjoyed the rear fenders of this set being built SNOT-wise. Also, the trike comes with a printed Police 1x2 tile which surprised me as I thought I'd have to apply a pesky sticker for this detail. It was nice to have a female officer included as well as the Dark Green legs of the motorist. <br><br>I feel that set is about $5 overpriced and thankfully I bought it at a discount of 30% so I paid a little less than what I think the set MSRP should have been.<br><br>If you are a fan of City and the new windscreens included in this set then I would highly suggest buying it on sale if you can. The build was quick and easy yet I learned a new way to build fenders and I will attempt similar builds using my own brick collection.<br><br>Now if only the set came with a printed ticket on a 1x2 tile (maybe the one from CMF 4) to issue the motorist when he gets one in the mail a few months later.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"AETerry","2011-08-29T14:13:05.197Z","Police Chase Review","Well, I bought it and I am not sure that $25 US is quiet worth the price tag of this set. Or at least it doesn't feel that way.<br><br>To start, this set comprises of basically 4 mini builds with in it and 3 minifigures. This is one of the few, rare sets to start showing a Police Woman as an officer. I like that. The other two minifigures are a second, Motorcycle cop and civilian driver.<br><br>The builds are 3 vehicles and then a corner set up for Traffic Lights, Speed Limit sign and speed radar. It all speaks of setting up an obvious chase scene, one that can be done with other Police cars and car sets, combining them together. For those going out to complete the 2011 Police theme and wanting all of the numbered vehicles, this is where you'll get Car #5 for the collection. Plus in the end you'll have a number of additional vehicles for a busy City or Town scene.<br><br>The first build, is a mini build is for the Police Trike or Tri-Wheel Motorcycle. It seems incongruous as the Police piece on this is preprinted while the other vehicles feature stickers. It seems odd. The Tri-Wheeler is quick and easy, reminiscent of the older 80's-90's motorcycles and it doesn't take long to add on the pieces to mark it as a Police vehicle.<br><br>The second build is for the #5 Police Car and it's got a sleek, modern sports car build for going after speeders. The build is fairly standard for a car, the only real change up is the use of element pieces to depict side mirrors on the car. It's not bad over all, lots of stickers on this one.<br><br>The third build is the red sports car, which is also a fairly standard build. It too features a dark grey square sticker to complement the car's design look. The civilian figure is similiar to another car set.<br><br>The final build is that of the street corner with the traffic light, speed sign and speed radar. By itself, the lights, radar and sign are all too crammed together. On the assumption you've got road plates, you can spread out these elements for a longer stretch of road.<br><br>Is it really worth the $25, maybe, if you're going for completing out the 2011 Police theme or are looking to flesh out a City layout. If you're not worried about building up a Police force or looking to add more cars to a collection, then you can skip over this set. I'd rather a set like this were closer to $20 for the builds. So perhaps waiting for a sale would be worth it to those looking to pick this set up.<br><br>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,3
"stagus","2011-09-21T08:46:21.047Z","Cool cars shame about the price","<p>Picked up this set off the official Lego shop for £18......£3 too high in my opinion.&nbsp; The box is one of the slim ones with 'Limited Edition' printed on the edge.&nbsp; It is a straightforward build and should have a fair amount of playability due to the traffic lights and the speed camera so&nbsp;the police can catch the fast drivers.&nbsp; With that in mind both the cars are excellent!&nbsp; They are not wildly different from the norm but there are some nice touches such as the twin pipe exhaust on the sports car or the sloped back on the police car.&nbsp; The police car is 'number 5' in this years police sets so if you want to collect them then this a must.&nbsp; The other vehicle is a police trike and is cool.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Both cars are cool 
<li>Police car number 5 for the overall police set collectors</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Too pricey! 
<li>…</li></ul>
<p>Overall a good set just a bit expensive for what it is even if it is a 'Limited Edition'.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
"xccj","2011-10-10T22:20:38.337Z","To Catch A Speeder","<p>""Police Chase"" is an interesting new police set, containing two cars, a motorbike, and a street corner.&nbsp; It's advertised as a ""Modular Build"" so that it's easy for younger kids to construct it.&nbsp; This is my first Modular Build set, but the only big difference I noticed was the two construction booklets.&nbsp; I was worried that the build might be too basic or something, but I was very impressed with the detail that went into the cars.&nbsp; Obviously the design itself wasn't simplified for younger builders; rather the was the pieces are presented to them is slightly altered.&nbsp; I guess it's not that big a deal, so I'll move onto the set now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three minifigures included in this set; two police figs and one civilian.&nbsp; There's nothing too spectacular about either of the police figs; the torsos are standard and look good.&nbsp; I do like the addition of the police woman to this set.&nbsp; I know there have been other female police figs in the past, but they've always been in the more expensive sets, so it's nice to see one in the medium price range.&nbsp; She doesn't have a female-specific police torso, but at least LEGO included the head and hair.&nbsp; The third fig is obviously the villian of the set; the speeder civilian fig.&nbsp; Just one look at his sunglasses and sly smile and you can tell he's up to no good.&nbsp; Again, he comes with some nice pieces, but nothing too rare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first vehicle you build is the police motorcycle / tricycle.&nbsp; It's basically the same three-wheeled bike LEGO police have been using for the last decade, but it's still a decent vehicle.&nbsp; It's nothing new, but I guess some classics never get old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next are the two cars; the #5 police car and the red sports car.&nbsp; One thing I noticed while building them was that they share a similiar design with only a few basic alterations.&nbsp; Thus, for an older builder, the construction might seem repetitive.&nbsp; (Is this the same for all new Lego cars?&nbsp; I dunno, this is my first city set in a while.)&nbsp; However, I did love building them.&nbsp; The design isn't complicated, but the use of the various slopes and curves round out the two cars really well, and I love how the flow continues on the front and rear bumpers.&nbsp; That was some lovely designs.&nbsp; Another neat thing was the use of the hinge plates to create side mirrors.&nbsp; Overall, the two cars have a very sleek and smooth look to them; one might not even realize they're constructed out of LEGO bricks at first because the flow is so well done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, you get to construct the sidewalk, which includes a traffic light, speed limit sign, and traffic camera.&nbsp; I wasn't too impressed with these, especially the traffic camera which has a very loose build for me.&nbsp; While they don't add much to the play value of the set, I still did like the additional plates, and I'm sure the traffic light and speed limit sign can easily be added to one's city collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I did enjoy building this set.&nbsp; It comes with some well designed cars, and the three vehicles allow for lots of chase scenes to be played out.&nbsp; The figs aren't extraordinary, but they're still nice, especially the policewoman.&nbsp; However, the $24.99 price does seem a little steep for this set.&nbsp; While I would recommend picking up this set, I would also suggest waiting until you can get it on sale.&nbsp; That's what I did anyway.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"Harmonious_Building","2012-03-13T21:30:29.95Z","Hi-speed hijinks.","This ""special edition"" set has garnered a bit of ire due to its price since it first came out, and I, too, was initially put off by the relatively hefty suggested retail price tag. Fortunately, LEGO decided to knock the price down by $5 on its official US site (as of March 2012), which led to a ripple effect that, to cut a long story short, convinced me to pick this up just to add a bit of traffic to my LEGO town.<div><br></div><div>What you see is what you get: three Minifigs, two cars, a sort of nostalgic police motorcycle, and an ugly street corner to round things out. Really, this set is sort of a portmanteau of the police car from the excellent Bank &amp; Money Transfer (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3661-1"">3661</a>) and the ever-popular Sports Car (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3661-1"">8402</a>), two sets that you are likely to have if you have been diligently building a town of any sort. Honesty, $20 or so for two cars plus some odds and ends is not bad, so if you can get it for around that price, you're unlikely to feel ripped off.</div><div><br></div><div>To judge this set on its own merits, it's quite from a playability point of view. The two police Minifigs are slightly different from the run-of-the-mill cops, and though it is a refreshing change to get a policewoman right out of the box, she's nothing so fancy that you wouldn't be able to recreate with minimal effort. The guy in the sports car is less of a ""criminal"" and more just ""a jerk with a really huge car"", but it's nice to have two vehicles in one sets to zip around the room, and the simple motorcycle - a throwback to <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=5531-1"">5531</a>, perhaps? - is an added bonus. The street corner won't be winning any accolades, but, at minimum, it provides a stable place for you to stand your Minifigs, or you can simply cannibalise the camera piece if the speed camera build doesn't impress you. Mercifully, the speed limit sign (50 km/h? 50 mph?) is a printed piece, so the torture of City Mini-Figure Collection (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=8401-1"">8401</a>) will not be repeated. The rest of stickers, predictably enough, end up on the police car, but they're easy to apply and should provide no grief.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now, comparisons to the cars in the previously mentioned Bank &amp; Money Transfer and Sports Car are more or less inevitable, so I may as well get that done.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v505/UtarEmpire/2012-03-13_21-11-16_936-2.jpg[/img]</div><div><br></div><div>The vehicles are more or less the same size when compared against their non-special-edition counterparts, and I suppose they each have their aesthetic pros and cons. The advantage of the Bank &amp; Money Transfer police car is that it sort of has storage space in the back for various police, uh, things, something that Police Chase's car is unable to do. The civilian car in Police Chase, though, looks a little nice than Sports Car in my opinion - I think the curves give it a pretty sleek and brash look, which I suppose is the point. Also, the presence of more dark grey to counter the red is also quite welcome.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you feel like your streets could do with more vehicles (and, more importantly, more policing) and you can find Police Chase for a good price, I say go for it. Alternatively, if you're looking for a small set that kids can have fun with for a long time, this will probably do the trick. If you feel that your town is fleshed out enough, and especially if you have dopplegangers of these vehicles already from other sets, you may want to give this a pass, though.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,3,3,3,5,3
"britgamer","2016-12-05T17:57:42.93Z","AMAZING","<p>In this set there are many different possibilities for play. If you had other police cars you could make a police chase or you could have them be pulled over the list could just keep on going. The minifigures are very generic but serve a great role in the set. The trike&nbsp;in the set is not the best but I still love it,I would&nbsp;prefer&nbsp;it if the set had a motorbike or even another police car but that is&nbsp;just me. Overall its a great set and even though it is discontinued it is still an amazing set.</p>
