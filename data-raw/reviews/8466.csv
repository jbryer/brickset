However the spinner, Nuckal's head, the wheels and the cannon might be most of that price.<br><br>Set: The vehicle itself is very cool, with a spring loaded cannon and very good suspension, it has an exhaust pipe on one side only, making it look a little lopsided. all in all this is a very good but pricey set.<br><br><br><input id=""gwProxy"" type=""hidden""><!--Session data--><input onclick=""jsCall();"" id=""jsProxy"" type=""hidden""><div id=""refHTML""></div><input id=""gwProxy"" type=""hidden""><!--Session data--><input onclick=""jsCall();"" id=""jsProxy"" type=""hidden""><div id=""refHTML""></div>",TRUE,3,5,4,4,2

Again, it includes kai, who they throw into every small set (the blacksmith shop and ninja ambush sets are better) and also the price to part on this feels way off, considering there aren&rsquo;t even any huge standout pieces. The skeleton Minifigure is alright, but the build is the worst part. It&rsquo;s a skeletal car with the only function being that it can roll around. Wow, so innovative! I wouldn&rsquo;t buy this for more than $10 on eBay, SEALED.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ninjago is a great TV show and this is another great set from the show!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set includes two minifigures: Nickel, and Kai (DX). Kai&#39;s leg and torso printings look amazing and shiny, and Nuckel&#39;s look good too.</p>

<p>The ATV has less parts than you&#39;d think, but it all adds up well. It has some suspension, a place for a minifigure to stand, and a missile launcher in front! It even includes a spinner for Kai!</p>

<p>I have had a lot of fun with this set and I highly recommend it!</p>
