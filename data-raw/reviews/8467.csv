What attracted us to this box was that it has a) Dragon Ninja and spinners b) 14 weapons. We thought it would be a good set to start our journey into the Ninjago world.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instruction</h4><div>The box looks great with the red ninja borders. The artwork depicting the set is nicely done, as of all the latest Lego sets. Last but not least, the 'Special Edition' text on the side adds an exclusive(?) touch to the overall look.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The instruction manual is your typical Lego style manuals. It serves its purpose well. At the end of the manual, there are instructions on how to play the spinner game. This I believe is unique only to Ninjago sets.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Nothing exciting about the parts. For 463 parts, the price seems OK. But most of these parts are small like the weapons. One thing is strange though. It said 14 weapons on the box but we only got 13. On the side of the box, it also showed only 13 weapons. I wonder which is the 14th one.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>There are 2 minifigures here. Cole DX is gorgeous. The dragon print in front is beautiful. But we are not too sure about having the name on the back. It just looks weird to have the name at the back like some football jersey. The other one is called Aonezai. Its pales in comparison to Cole DX and looks weak. As it takes 2 to play the spinner game, I guess we cannot complain much about it.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The build was fast and easy. My 7 year old can do it on his own so I believe it will be a breeze for almost anyone. One thing good though is the minimal use of stickers here. Only 3 small ones. The door panels with the Ninja words are printed. Nice!</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>The completed set is small in my opinion. There is not much space in the arena to spin the 2 minfigs. The colours used are nice with lots of red and brown. And as mentioned earlier, we like the printed door panels with the ninja words.</div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 16px; font-size: 12px; color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-weight: bold; ""><br></span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 16px; font-size: 12px; color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-weight: bold; "">Summary</span></div><div>Overall, the set is still a pretty decent set to get started to the Ninjago set and game. You get 2 minifig with spinners and game cards. The spinning game is easy to learn and my son seemed to like to play it.&nbsp;</div><div>The set design and build is nothing spectacular.</div><div><br></div><div>I hope you will find the review useful and thanks for reading.</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

<h4>Pros</h4>

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Price, Price, Price<br></li><li>Could use more figures for the price.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is alright, but I would have NEVER paid $49.99 for it.&nbsp; It has some cool pieces and Cole DX is great but really that price is pretty crazy for this set.</p><p><br></p><p>The max I could see someone reasonably paying for this set is $19.99-$24.99, but luckily I was able to get it for super clearance at Target for $5.99.</p><p><br></p><p>I can't ever see just playing with the set as is, but it is a good set for spare parts to build up other Ninjago sets.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,1
