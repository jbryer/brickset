Apparently I'm happy with all the PotC set I have build and those I haven't yet, LOL. Very happy when I opened the set, the instuction and poster has a backing board. I just recently build 4192 Fountain of Youth and was disappointed that it has no backing board and the instructions and poster was folded. Very happy that this one has them, maybe on the set 4192 was a fluke, but this time I dont have a PotC card??? Im assuming all the sets have a character card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build took me a couple of minutes, and it was alright. I do love the turning wall that turns Barbossa to his skeleton look. I am not sure if these parts are from the Ninjago, but I love the arms and skeleton legs with boots. Dont know why they did not do that to the skeleton at 4192. Minifigures are awesome, would have been nice if there's a fifth figures (but dont we all want extra figure: :D ). Would also be nice if there a couple of difference to the Jack Sparrow minifigures from different sets, as far as I can see most of them has the same torso, but different faces are awesome. On this set Jack has his zombie face or death face. I also love the new gold bar, there a good addition as it serves as gold bars and a linking brick. Much better if it was the usual gold chrome though. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all this set is wonderful and always worth collecting. Price could have been lowered to $15, but having it for $20 is good enough. Im sure there are loyalty fee's that lego themselves have to pay for this licensed sets. Gonna be waiting for coming deals with local stores so I can have extra sets. Now go get this sets everybody. :D</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"David1971","2011-05-04T09:03:16.907Z","Lots of nice bits including a Lego Keira Knightley!","Although not especially a fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, I thought this would be a nice Lego theme. And it is! For my first set, I wanted to get one of the two £20 sets, and based on minifigures, this one was the winner, as you get the nice female figure, Elizabeth Swann, as well as a Jack Sparrow, plus the pirate Hector Barbossa. <br><br>(You also get a skeleton version of Barbossa, which I'm afraid, like some of the more rubbish droids in Star Wars sets, I don't really count as a proper minifig).<br><br>So the three main minifigs are all very nicely done, with lots of detail. Does the Elizabeth Swann minifig look like Keira Knightley? Well yes, sort of, in the Lego way. It's certainly not a bad likeness. And Captain Jack has printing all over and a very good piratey hairpiece.<br><br>The rest of the set has some interesting bits and bobs - nice to get two apples, swords, boat, etc. It's quite a good little play scene. <br><br>Incidentally the reviewer Niallskie (review posed on 20 April 2011) says that they built the set in ""a couple of minutes"". I have to say, that's nonsense. It's not a big set, but even if you were really *racing* to build it ... well it just wouldn't be possible to do it in two minutes. That's ridiculous. You just can't physically click together 152 pieces, following the instructions, in that time. I built the set at a moderate pace, enjoying the process but not going especially slowly, but not rushing either, and it takes a pleasant 25-30 minutes.<br><br>Of course, it's quite expensive for what you get, but, once you're used to Lego pricing, it's not bad. Ideally it should be a £15 set rather than a £20 set. No stickers, though; lots of nice detail; and they even bothered to put the poster and instructions in a bag with tough board so that they don't get bent or bashed up in the box, which is a nice touch.<br><br>So overall, I did enjoy this set.<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"MovieNerd","2011-05-03T03:31:37.937Z","Why couldn't the gold be chrome?","<p>Honestly I was really looking forward the the gold chrome bars that appeared to be coming with this set and yet imagine my surprise when I opened this set up to discover they were a dull flat gold color instead. I was disappointed more then I should be, but still if they are chrome in all of the photos and on the BOX for crying out loud, then they should be chrome when I open the box.</p><p>Also I was just expecting more from this set, just something bigger for the amount of time they spend there in the movie and how important it is to the plot. I'm just wishing there was more to this set. I was also a little disappointed in the non-skeleton Barbossa figure. I think he should have gotten a hair/hat piece like some of the Jack minifigs do, because his face just doesn't look right without the long hair that the character had. Also why couldn't they have painted the neck of the skeleton side of Jack's face white? That way you could have added him to a skeleton body too to fight skeleton Barbossa.</p><p>I do like the Elizabeth figure and the Skeleton Barbossa figure too (the ""boots"" on the feet are a nice touch). It's also cool that they included a boat in the set as well. Also bravo to LEGO for including the plastic protected and carboard backed poster and instructions in even one of the smaller sets. The smaller boxes are nice too.</p><p>It's a decent little set, but I am hoping they make something bigger further down the line of this theme lasts.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,4

<h4>Parts of Interest...Parts I like...or BOTH!</h4>
<p>Some great-new parts here, notably the compass pieces (printed graphics), shoulder strapped sword holders&nbsp;and pearl-gold bars. Though, the coins and gold bars aren't chrome-gold like they appear on the box art. <em>From what&nbsp;some have said, contact Lego's customer service and I believe they'll replace the coins and gold bars to their chrome versions for ya'(have to try this myself).</em></p>

<h4>Rowboat details...</h4>
<p>The rowboat is one solid piece, brown hull with some basic, added bricks&nbsp;for the latern and seats plus 2 notches in front to hold the oars upright&nbsp;and rowlocks on both sides.</p>

"AETerry","2011-05-08T14:30:35.83Z","Isla de la Muerta Review","<p>When the PoTC movies first came out, a liscensed deal with Mega Bloks had been made, so any brick sets available at that time were all Mega Blok brand and just horrible looking. And I remember shaking my head and going I have plenty of LEGO Pirate sets already, I'll stick with those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Stranger Tides coming out, a new liscense deal is out and its with LEGO and I have to say, with the box art they look great and on opening a set to build, I am further not disappointed. The sets aren't just for Stranger Tides, but earlier PoTC movies as Isla de la Muerta shows. A scene right out of Curse of the Black Pearl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 4 minifigures - Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Hector Barbossa (all three of whom are magnificinent and look worthy of something out of the Collectible Minifigures line) and Skeleton Barbossa who's my least favorite and meh. Barbossa is wearing a new accessory in the way of the musketeer style hat and a scabard for his cutlass that you can fit into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main set is alright, the mast has a push lever on it so you can make a trap out of it and the turn table that Barbossa stands on allows for play when the moonlight hits him and he turns into a skeleton. There's lots of matte' or pearl gold pieces, chalice and a gemstone for the treasure that's laying around in the cave. A chest that even more gold and gold bars are found in. What I am disappointed by here is the picture shows the gold bars and coins to be chrome gold, not that matte' or pearl gold coloring. The gold crystal cluster I like the look of, it's more metalic and better then the gold crystal gotten from the Pharoah's Quest theme - Scarab Attack set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final piece(s) is the rowboat, it's the same design in all the other Pirate themes that LEGO has done, so no need to reinvent the wheel, perhaps just a change of color choices for the benches that people sit on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a fun little set, either for play or for Collectibilty and comes in at around $19.99 for the set, so it's not too bad for number of pieces, liscense, unique pieces, extra pieces&nbsp;and the minifigure detail work.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5
"wander099","2011-05-17T11:24:17.5Z","Pearl gold instead of chrome gold","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Like the other sets in this theme, the box has been made smaller in comparison to the size of the set.&nbsp; However, this is not a problem as there is ample room inside to store the bricks included.&nbsp; The instructions consist of a single booklet and are placed in protective cardboard sheath along with the poster.&nbsp; As a result they are not bent or mangled.&nbsp; However, this is not the case in all POTC sets.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are many excellent parts included in this set.&nbsp; For instance, there is a large row boat, blue flames (not transparent and used on Barbossa's hat). You also get two of Jack's compass and an extra sword, as well as a brand new piece to allow minifigures to carry a sword as if in a sheath.<br></p><p> It is supposed to include chrome gold coins and bars, but my set came with pearl ones, which was a big disappointment.&nbsp; This is my main complaint about this set.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set comes with four minifigures: Jack Sparrow, Hector Barbossa, skeleton Hector Barbossa, and Elizabeth Swann.&nbsp; I think this set should have come with Will Turner as he was in the scene and a key character at that.</p><p>Jack Sparrow is excellent.&nbsp; His hair and bandanna are one large piece and his head is double-sided with one side being his normal face and the other side being his skeleton face.&nbsp; His torso and legs are the same as the other versions of Jack, it is very accurate to the movie, and there is back printing on the torso.<br></p><p>Hector Barbossa is also great.&nbsp; His hat is very well done and has the blue flame as a feather.&nbsp; His head is not double-sided, there is printing on both sides of his torso and on the front of his legs.&nbsp; He also comes with a sword sheath, a sword, and an apple.</p><p>The skeleton version of Barbossa comes with the same accessories as the regular minifigure.&nbsp; The body and feet are like the new Ninjago skeletons.&nbsp; The head is white and has a similar face to the other Barbossa minifigure, except this one has an evil grin, grey circles around the eyes, and cheek bones.</p><p>The Elizabeth Swann minifigure is wearing the red dress Barbossa gave her from the first movie and has the aztec gold necklace printed on her torso.&nbsp; Her head is double-sided and her angry/scared face looks rather odd.&nbsp; But still an okay minifigure (if you don't use the odd face).<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is quite easy and short as would be expected with this size set.&nbsp; However, attention to detail is required because misplacement of some of the smaller pieces is easy to do.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model has a couple of play features.&nbsp; First, there is the platform that spins so that the Barbossa figures can be switched to 'transform' him into skeleton version.&nbsp; The other feature is the mast, which can be made to fall across the entrance area.&nbsp; This feature only works so-so as the horizontal part of the mast can rotate and get in the way.<br></p>The treasure chest with the Aztec gold is well designed.&nbsp; Just like in the movie it is a separate island from the rest and has a lid that can be removed completely or slid partially off.&nbsp; All the coins can be stored inside.&nbsp; If Will Turner was included, then this set would include everything needed to re-enact the scenes from the Isla de Muerta in the movie.
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I recommend this set to older children and adults who are fans of Pirates of the Caribbean and want all the characters.&nbsp; This set includes exclusive minifigures that are required if you want to collect the main characters.&nbsp; It is the only set that includes Elizabeth Swann and Barbossa from the first three movies.&nbsp; Also, Jack's skeleton face and the skeleton version of Barbossa are pretty good too.<br></p><p>I would not recommend this set for children because it lacks playability and other sets in the theme would be more appealing to children because there are more play features in them (for example, the cannibal escape).&nbsp; There are also many small pieces some of which are not directly attached to the main model (ex. coins) and would be easy for a child to lose.</p><p>The only cons aside from playability are that this set should have included Will Turner because he was an important character in this scene and the coins/bars should have been made in chrome gold as they appeared to be on the box and in pictures online.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,3

The poster is cool, it has a picture of Jack&nbsp;and Barbossa (skeleton)&nbsp;dualing and&nbsp;Elizibeth is just standing there while Will (why is he in the poster?)&nbsp;takes&nbsp;aztec gold from the chest, the other side is just like the others&nbsp;with the map and voodoo doll Jack code on the back.&nbsp;I think it should have came with the minifigs i mentiond and a bigger&nbsp;cave, it should be $30&nbsp;with the extra stuff then it would be a good set.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4

"Legonat","2011-09-16T21:07:07.237Z","He didn't waste his shot...","So I went to Wall-Mart hoping to buy the new LEGO Star Wars videogame when this set caught my eye. I had to get it, not only did I love the movie and the scene, but the figs would inspire some really cool MOCs. First of all, I must say, buy two of this set to get the most playability out of it (them?). Add white hands to Mortal Barbossa and put Cursed Barbossa's head and hat on and you've got a nicer looking Cursed Barbossa. ""You can't beat me, Jack."" -Hector Barbossa. Buy the tiny $3.49 soldier set from Pirates II theme (if you can find it) and remove the yellow hands, add Elizabeth's, remove the head, add Elizabeth's and you've got a more realistic Elizabeth. "" Do you like pain? Try wearing a corset!"" -Elizabeth Swann. Add white hands to Cursed Jack for maximum realistic-ness. ""I couldn't resist, mate."" -Jack Sparrow. You might also want to add Will Turner and some other crew mates to the scene. There for better minifigs. Time to move on...<br>The biggest fault I find in this set is: Where's all the gold? I mean, the Cursed Aztec Gold haul consisted of over a thousand doubloons inside it (although LEGO would go half bankrupt if they added that many coins to the set) they sure could have added more coins instead of the 1 x 1 pearl gold studs. I personally got eight gold coins in pearl gold to add to the chest. The next con is: Where's Will? He was there the whole time in the scene. Would it have killed LEGO to add a fourth minifig? I doubt it. I'm hopeful we will be seeing many more POTC sets with more figs to add to this set.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"CapnRex101","2011-11-06T17:06:49.14Z","4181 - Isla De La Muerta","<p>In the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, there were a couple of scenes which were memorable for a long time. This was one of them, the long and wild duel between the two immortals, Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa. It was bound to be turned into a Lego set, and at this price point, I think this is as good as they could make it. In my opinion it would have been done better if there were more to it, but that would of course in turn raise the price. In case you are not familiar with the Lego design process, this is how it goes, each designer is given a model they need to create and a price for which it will have to sell, occasionally they are not given a guide price and can just go crazy (the UCS&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;Falcon was an example of that). This set really needed only one thing, a more substantial model at a higher price. Nevertheless, I am here to review the set which we got, so here goes...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box shows the set laid out on a rocky background, like the caves from the film. There is some water where the rowing boat is floating and we can see the skeletal cursed Barbossa peeking out from behind the rock formations. In the corner is a line up of the four Minifigures included in the set which are all great, and all exclusive!&nbsp;</p><p>The instructions were fine, no mistakes that I could find and no missing pieces either. They were packed in a plastic bag like in all of the other Pirates of the Caribbean sets, but this set does not come with a card, they are only in On Stranger Tides sets. The poster is fairly small, and actually does not show the main part of the set, it shows only the figures and the chest, as well as some random other Aztec gold. For some reason Will Turner is on the poster too standing by the treasure chest, although he is not included.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>One of the best things about this set is the parts selection in my opinion. I love the number of gold pieces, goblets, studs, gold jumper plates, a lump of gold ore, two new gold bars and lots of coins (which were shiny gold for me). The light grey curved support structure piece is fantastic, I for one have not seen this part in this colour before, and it could be very useful! Sadly we only get one, which alone cannot really be used for anything. We get a couple of new sword sheaths in black, two green apples, a light grey blade and a gem I have not seen before in this colour, a sort of translucent light blue. All of the grey slope pieces could be useful too.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The other element of this set I adore is the&nbsp;Minifigures. All four of them are totally exclusive to the Isla de la Muerta, my particular favourite is the regular&nbsp;<b>Hector&nbsp;Barbossa</b> figure which is not only a great character to have due to his importance throughout the films, but also because of the excellent detail, he wears a rather extravagant hat which was also seen with the Musketeer from Series 5 of the Collectable Minifigures but in this model the hat has a blue feather, his torso has front and back printing of his long jacket and his legs have a continuation of his torso printing. He also has a sword and a sheath for it. The <b>Cursed &nbsp;Barbossa</b> is quite a good figure too, with the same hat as the regular Barbossa, a skeletal version of his face with his beard, the rest of the Minifigure is made up of Ninjago skeleton pieces, the new torso, the new legs with boots, and the new arms. He also has a sword and sheath.</p><p>Then we have the two heroes, first is <b>Jack Sparrow</b>, who in this set is different to all of his other incarnations with a determined expression on his face and a skeleton face on the reverse, in this set he is without his hat. Next we have <b>Elizabeth Swann</b>, who has a lovely hairpiece, seen on Syrena the mermaid in brown, but this time in a sort of ginger/blonde colour. Her torso has front and back printing and instead of legs she has a printed slope piece as her dress. Both are very nice figures, I hope they release Elizabeth in other outfits in future, if they continue the theme that is.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fairly short and simple, about 20 minutes, no really different building techniques but I really think this is more of a set for younger children, so an easy build is good for them. It has given me some new ideas on how to construct good looking rock formations, which are notoriously difficult to make.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When finished the final product is small and somewhat spindly. There is really not a lot to it, but for such a tiny bit of scenery they have really packed in the features. We have a falling mast, which is quite a fun feature, not something I saw in the film but never mind. We also have a swivelling platform, which can show Barbossa's transformation from man to monster and is again, decent but could have been left out. The chest is really nice I think, I am glad they included a brick-built chest rather than one of those brown two piece treasure chests, which given the look of it in the film, would have been too small and two ornate. We also get a brown rowing boat with oars, which is good as this is the only set with a rowing boat in that colour. They are always very useful as they seem to appear very frequently in all four of the movies.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, I would put this towards the bottom of you list of sets to purchase from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme. It is not the worst but far from the best. Just an all round simple and decent set. Certainly worth the price for what you get, especially due to the great parts selection. If you want the set for Elizabeth and Barbossa, I would say it is still worth buying as you can simply part out the rest of the set. I would recommend this set and give it...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5

Mega bloks made a&nbsp;rubbish version of this scene so I did not buy it and am glad I didn't because this is a lot better.</p>
<h4>Box/instructions</h4>
<p>The box art on all of the PotC sets are really nice and this is no exception. It makes the set look very nice but there is a problem The box art shows shiny gold coins and bars but in reality they are a pearly gold colour. The instructions are clear and mistake-free and comes with&nbsp;cardboard packaging and plastic bag&nbsp;packaging to keep it in good condition. Inclued in that bag is a poster showing cursed barbossa standing in a puddle&nbsp;fighting normal Jack with&nbsp;will and elizabeth in the background with the chest and some gold. It is a nice poster and will look good on a wall.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The minifigures in this set are really, really good. Hector Barbossa looks fantastic. The detailing on him is superb and looks great. He also has a fantastic hat and a black scabbard. Cursed jack is interesting as he has a unique head with the cursed version on one side and a concentrated face on the other. Elizabeth Swan is another great minifigure with nice colours and a cool hairpiece. Cursed Barbossa is a plain ninjago skeleton with a black scabbard, Barbossa's hat and a white version of Barbossa's head. He is nice and represents the&nbsp;cursed Barbossa well but not as good in&nbsp;as the other one in my opinion. Both Barbossa's have an apple.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;Parts</h4>
<p>I really like the parts in this set. The rowboat is a good bit and this set is a cheap way to get one of those spinning pieces. There is lots of bling&nbsp;such as the diamond and the golden chalice.&nbsp;There is also a grooved 2x2round piece on top of the spinning wall.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Was short and standard. No interesting techniques were used and it was all a bit plain but because it was short it couldn't get boring.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>I really like the completed model. The colours are really cool and everything looks nice together. The spinning wall detracts from the overall look of the set but that is not a biggie. The bling looks really cool alng therock formation and the mast looks great when it is hanging over the cave entrance.</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>The playability is pretty good. You can have swordfights between Hector and Jack or have mast collapse over the cave entrance. The spinning wall works well but isn't a neccesity and neither is the mast but&nbsp;I&nbsp;personally like the mast. The only thing it could have would be Pintel or Ragetti but that would drive up the price.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This set is superior over the mega bloks version and is great set over all. It is not the best but it is certainly better than the shower curtain of youth. This set is better than the fountain of youth in my opinion because it looks good, has a rowboat and has&nbsp;really cool gold details. This isn't the worst and it isn't the best but it is a good set but it is overpriced. I recommend it to fans of the movie, theme and pirates in general. It is a great addition to PotC.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,3
