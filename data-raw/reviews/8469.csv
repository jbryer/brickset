"Niallskie","2011-04-21T05:42:23.51Z","This set is not to be caged.","<p>This is one of the two PotC set I build today and I am both happy with them. I say for $30 price tag this set is awesomely just. I again did not get a backing board on this set nor the free card, just glad intructions are in great shape as well as the poster. Oh and for you who don't like stickers ( who does??? :D ) this set dont have no sticker. It seems that Lego is trying to take away stickers as much as they can, shows they are listening to fans requests and needs. I also think less intruction book is better, than those multiple ones you get from city sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigures are great, trival face of Jack Sparrow is a refreshing change from the usual JSparrow though the set, of course it does reflect his look for the set. Even the two natives are fantastic, each native minifigure are different from face, torso and legs. First build on this set is the BBQ pole, simply built but serves its purpose to cook JSparrow. Up next is the throne, and I do have to say by far this is the best throne I have ever come upon. I have a good deal of Castles and still nothing compares to this throne. This throne sits a minifigure perfectly, loved the printed brick as well as the skull element, would be nice if the skulls are the mean looking ones. Another fantastic conception of a build is the bone cage where Will was locked. It is just fantastic how they build it, adding the long bone element to make it more tribal. For me the base where the cage is hooked up is just alright, nothing special there, I just liked the combination of green and brown leaves, instead of making them all green or all brown. The new clear bottle is always a great addition as well as the light brown pouch give a bit of life the the tribesmen's cave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all this set is pretty impressive and&nbsp; a must to collect, playability is fantastic for kids and adult as well. Im glad to have this set as im sure eventually you can see that if all the PotC sets are put together, they do make a great movie scene. Go get it and have fun playing or displaying this set, totally worth it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"legospongepotter","2011-05-09T21:22:54.56Z","Those Cannibals...","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This set is among those in the first wave of Pirates of the Caribbean. This is my first ever Pirates of the Caribbean set. Be warned: I haven't seen the movies or gone on the ride in Disney (I was there a few weeks ago, I wish I could've gone!) or had any experience with Pirates of the Caribbean. The sets looked so cool with lots of unique characteristics, I had to be sure to get a set. This set is worth it and affordable.<div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>There are many different features in this set. There are:</div><div><ul><li><i>4 Great Minifigures</i></li><li><i>2 Snakes</i></li><li><i>A Revolving Fire Spit</i></li><li><i>A Throne Chair</i></li><li><i>Cannibal Hut which attaches to the-</i></li><li><i>Bone Cage</i></li></ul><div><i><br></i></div></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""font-style: italic; white-space: pre; "">	</span>With so many different parts, this set stands out and I would highly&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;it. Here's why, starting with the Minifigures.</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigures</h4><div><b>Jack Sparrow: </b>Of all the Jack Sparrow Minifigures out there (yet I only own this one), this is the most comical. He comes with a compass: A dark blue 1x1 tile with gold printing on to represent a compass. You actually get two, one for the set, another as an extra piece. Jack gets brown legs with some printing on it: tatters and what looks like some bits of red and white cloth that continues on his torso. The torso has a belt over a blue vest/jacket. Underneath you see some of his chest. His arms are white while his hands are skin-color. He gets some backprinting: just more of the belt and this strap that is also on the front. His face is the funny part. He is double-sided, and has him on both sides a small beard and mustache with large eyes. He has six painted eyes on his face, three per side. One side of his face has a satisfied expression, while the other has him screaming in fear or surprise. His hair piece is lots of black hair that stretches over his torso and on the back. He has a red&nbsp;bandanna&nbsp;to top it off. On the back of this extravagant hair piece is some braids and a continuation of the bandanna. It came in a separate bag.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Will Turner: </b>If I heard right, Will Turner appears in only one other set: 4183: The Mill. I like this Minifigure. He gives the impression of an elite warrior - er, pirate. He has dark brown pants and great torso. He has a grayish shirt under a large brown belt with a&nbsp;silver&nbsp;buckle. His shirt is open at the top, revealing a&nbsp;silver&nbsp;necklace underneath. There is some backprinting, just lines for his shirt and more of that belt. He&nbsp;comes&nbsp;with a new piece exclusive to Pirates of the Caribbean: A sword-holder. It is similar to the handbag seen in some sets that must be slipped on before the head with the arm of a Minifigure raised. Here, where the 'bag' should be, is the sword&nbsp;holder. There is some room to slip the silver sword through the space and have it hanging out in the back like a, well, pirate. His face is also double-sided. both sides. He has one of those little mustaches, just a bit of hair. Same with his beard. He has brown side burns on the sides of his face. One side shows him with a sort of happy-determined look, as if laughing during a sword fight because he loves it. The other face is a smile, though it&nbsp;looks&nbsp;like his mouth is twitching. Perhaps he wants to laugh at Jack's hilarious head. He has sleek brown hair with a pony tail in the back.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cannibal One: </b>There are two cannibals in this set. They are different, though they have similarities. The first has brown legs and a red loincloth. On his torso is a belt of bones and a necklace of&nbsp;bones&nbsp;with a skull in the place of where a jewel would go. He wears no shirt so you can see how emaciated he is. No wonder he's hungry....He also has some yellow tattoos or paint or some type of making. The back of his torso shows more yellow tattoos. His face has more yellow tattoos and an angry expression with teeth showing, like a growl. He has awesome hair/ It's black and circular, almost&nbsp;like&nbsp;a hat. At the top there is a 'ponytail' which is actually a clip for a small white bone. He gets a nice long brown spear.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cannibal Two: </b>The second of the two cannibals. He has brown legs with another red loincloth. Skulls seem to hang from the loincloth ominously. His torso shows a sort of sash of bones hanging loosely across his torso. Some printing shows a full stomach. Maybe this is the leader cannibal and gets a lot more food than his servant. He has&nbsp;some&nbsp;more yellow tattoos. He has a smaller necklace of bones around his neck. on the back shows the back of the sash and necklace with a bit more tattoos. His head is different as well. His teeth are clenched as if frustrated, and his eyes are obviously angry. White paint like a mash surrounds his eyes. His hair is the same as the other cannibal, as is the spear.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Snakes: </b>Not actual Minifigures. You get two standard snakes: green and red.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Fire Spit</h4><div>This is one of those logs that get turned round and round over a fire to cook a person that is in all the movies. On a small baseplate there is a little fire with a couple orange studs and flames. Above is mainly a round stick piece, but at the end there is a piece that also spins with four studs. You can attach a Minifigure by the legs and spinning it with a piece on one outer end. It's a simple design, though very appreciated.</div><div><br></div><h4>Throne</h4><div>Again, I have not seen the movies, though I believe Jack becomes the 'god' at one point and has his own little throne. It is a chair with foliage sprouting at the bottom and with the a great back. Little Jack can rest his back against a 4x2 smooth piece with intricate skull designs on tree bark. Oh yeah - printed. There are no stickers in this set. The top of this chair has a skull head on top. Fang pieces poke through the top as well. There are also these pieces that look like some kind of big torch or sticks on either side of the throne with skulls on top. They move up and down. There is also some brown plant sprouting from the throne. A very well-designed seat of power.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Cannibal Hut</h4><h4><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""2""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">The meat of the set: The Cannibal Hut. It seems like a tree hollowed out with a archway for a door. Some foliage is coming out of the hut at the bottom. One side has a small opening in the bark for a window, the other side has more foliage sprouting midway top the top. One piece in front that looks&nbsp;like&nbsp;jagged rock is actually all one piece to represent bark. The tree arches to the left. On the inside there is a bit of room past the doorway.There is a crate with a sword and a glass bottle on one side below the window. Another has one of those tan back-packs seen in City sets nowadays. It hangs from the wall and has some little&nbsp;potion&nbsp;bottle. Up top on the tree there is&nbsp;some&nbsp;standing space. Large gray leaves hang outwards. Another turning device allows you to move a couple of connected chains up and down. The chains start off wrapped around this device and travel up the arch of the tree, passing bright green leaves and a multi-colored&nbsp;parrot piece. The chain continues and eventually hangs over the edge of the tree, where the chain is connected to the&nbsp;Bone&nbsp;Cage.</span></font></h4><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""2""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br></span></font></div><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""2""><b>The Bone Cage</b></font></div><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""2"">This special cage is made up of several bones,&nbsp;beige&nbsp;wand pieces, and Technic pieces (I think). Skulls are also attached. When building, it seems&nbsp;like&nbsp;you build a web with the sides all branches of the center. Then it all snaps together in the end to form the cage. The door way of this set can be raised up and down. It can hold two Minifigures inside. It is the highlight of this set and the reason I got it (or my brother got it). It is attached to that chain on top and can be lowered or raised.</font></div><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""2""><br></font></div><h4><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""2"">Overall</font></h4><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""2"">So basically, this set is definitely worth the thirty bucks. I don't know what else to expect, especially with the stunning bone cage. I would&nbsp;highly&nbsp;reccomend it even if you don't care for Pirates of the Caribbean (like me).&nbsp;The&nbsp;Minifigures are all amazing and&nbsp;almost&nbsp;all of them are exclusive, excluding Will Turner. I'm&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;getting more sets.</font></div><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""2""><br></font></div><div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""2""><br></font></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

Overall, it is the highlight of this set! 10/10</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bag three: The hut/ crane: </p><p>This part of the set slightly dissapointed me, the exterior and the crane are superb, the look is nice, and it looks nicely detailed, the interior unfortunately fails, consisting of only one pepper pot, and a box. (To make the look nicer, i moved around the brown rock pieces, this is a suggestion for you AFOLS!) Even with a shoddy interior it still looks superb! 7/10</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall: 97/100</p><p>The highlight out of the £30 and below range, i highly suggest you get this, if only for the minifigs!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HWR1996, Signing out!</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"wander099","2011-06-07T17:07:16.817Z","Watch out for Cannibals!","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This is one of the sets that comes in a smaller box than a set this size would normally have.&nbsp; There is also a single instruction booklet, which is nice.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some parts of note in this set.&nbsp; There are quite a few skull and bone pieces, foliage pieces in two different colours, a sack piece, a couple of rum bottles, a parrot, and a flat printed piece with a bone design.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Your get four minifigures: Jack Sparrow, William Turner, and two different cannibals.&nbsp; The Jack Sparrow figure is the same one included in many sets with one notable exception: both of his faces have tribal make-up.&nbsp; The Will Turner figure is also quite impressive as his face is a very good likeness of Orlando Bloom and the hair piece is perfect.&nbsp; His torso is printed on both sides and he comes with a sword holder.&nbsp; What I really like about this set is that the cannibal minifigures aren't simply identical and both are highly detailed with skull jewelery and body paint.&nbsp; They each have a hairpiece that has a place for a bone to snap in.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is not difficult, but it is not repetitive either.&nbsp; There are no terribly complicated or difficult steps.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model covers the scene from the movie very well.&nbsp; There are three main components: the throne of bones that Jack sits on, the spit over the fire, and the bone cage mechanism.&nbsp; The first component has no play functions other than to sit Jack on the throne.&nbsp; The second component allows you to place either Jack or Will on the spit over the fire and have the cannibals roast them.&nbsp; The cage mechanism includes a crank to raise and lower the cage, a platform for the cannibals to stand on (and guard the crank), the cage itself (which opens so a minifigure can be placed inside), and a little alcove with the bottles of rum and swords (confiscated from Jack and Will obviously).<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I highly recommend this set to POTC fans of all ages.&nbsp; The play features are excellent and work without any problems; they will be greatly enjoyed by children.&nbsp; Adults will enjoy the high degree of accuracy to which the scene from the movie can be played out.&nbsp; Additionally, for the pieces, functions, and minifigures included, this set is an excellent value at $39.99 CDN and if you can find it on sale it is a steal (I got mine 1/2 off during a BOGO offer).<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5

"srose_2013","2018-08-11T21:25:22.217Z","Unexpected Surprise","<p>I did not think I wanted this set. When the Pirates of the Caribbean sets first came out, this was one of the least intriguing compared to The Black Pearl and The Mill. Then, once all the sets retired and &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; was in the making, I got the itch for more Pirates. I was hoping for more sets for the fifth&nbsp;movie. Unfortunately, the price on the Silent Mary&nbsp;is a bit steep and the set really does not do much for me. And since I have absolutely no interest in Brickheadz, I decided to pay almost double the retail price for The Cannibal Escape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a good investment. I honestly like--almost love--this set more than I thought I would. Although the minifigures&nbsp;are not really &quot;new&quot; since almost all the Pirates&nbsp;sets come with Will (along with Jack Sparrow), the choice of characters makes complete sense. What I love&nbsp;is that this set includes&nbsp;the bone cage and the throne. I found those to be really fun builds that reflect&nbsp;the scene from the second movie. The hut and the fire pit are a little small, but I expected them to be given the price and piece count.</p>

<p>Overall, the set does not compare to others in the series as far as minifigures&nbsp;or size; however, I think the detail is still incredible and well-worth the retail price. I probably would not pay more than $40.00 for this set unless you are a huge fan of Pirates of the Caribbean simply because it is not a big set.</p>
