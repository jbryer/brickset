<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was walking in TRU today after visiting walmart, and spotted the POTC set Cannibal Escape all on its own. I snatch it up, and carried it through the store. My brother wanted to look at something and on the other side of the store, I found this set. There was about three of them, I picked one up but was not really interested in buying it. I did, and here's my review!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't seen POTC so bear with me. You get a beatiful double torso printed jack sparrow with printed legs, and a cutlass as well as a printed compass. There's also two aother figures, one with printed legs and double printed head, the other without. One of them has a new sheath that a figure wears similiar to the indiana jones satchel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interesting pieces include a printed 1x1 tile that's a compass, and two bottles with ships printed on them. As well as three Ninjago bone pieces. There's a nice table with a printed dish, and a golden cup. There's a plethora of brown telescopes, about five. 5 golden studs are also included. The wine shelf it self is a deep brown colour that is very pleasing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extra pieces are:</p>
<p>1x1 white slope</p>
<p>1x1 brown slope</p>
<p>1x1 printed compass piece. (yes you get two.)</p>
<p>a flame piece</p>
<p>an extra cutlass</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price could have been $9.99 instead of $11.99, but TRU has a buy one get one 50% off sell, so its a good deal. I highly recommend this set, and suggest you should buy it as soon as you see it!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my review, and I would recommend this set to a friend!</p>

"Niallskie","2011-04-19T16:53:44.427Z","small set yet sweeeet for your collection","<p>Been hitting most of the local store here in Oregon to check for PoTC and had been very disappointed these past days. Decided to call the local Lego store and BAM. they had it yesterday, so I zoomed in there coz its like 5min away from us. All the sets are there except for the Queen Anne's, they said they had only 4 sets of that and it flew out of the shelf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the review then, first love the small box as it is a space saver for those who save the boxes and for those who collect extra sets. This is actually the first set I have opened and&nbsp;was really happy to be greeted by a backing board for the instruction, though small as this set is, they still put that board to help straighten the instuctions. Oh and there was a free poster and a Jack Sparrow card, no matter what it is everybody loves something free. i also noticed that the globe was on a separate plastic as well as Jack Sparrow's hair piece, love how lego is separating the special pieces of the sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Build this set in just a couple of minutes and was really amazed, the globe stand's design is very simple but amazing for it to be concieved that way. The bottle stand or cabinet is also fantastic as well as the rotating table. Large bone pieces are very nice but the best brick for me besides the globe is the printed bottle, thank goodness no stickers. Another amazing piece is the sword holders, dont know if its an old design but its the first time i have seen is and its a great addition. Everybody knows lego puts on some extra pieces for the just incase, and I am very happy I got and extra compass, hopefully everybody does.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"CapnRex101","2011-04-23T12:33:03.8Z","4191 - Captain's Cabin","<p>I am astounded by the quality of the Pirates of the Caribbean sets, they are simply fantastic. The smallest of them so far, Captain's Cabin does not let down the series, far from it in fact, I love it!</p><p>For such a small set you get great playability and the set features loads of great pieces (including 3 brand new moulds).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>Well, in case you were not aware, the Lego&nbsp;company&nbsp;is trying to reduce packaging in its sets, which is great I think, and in my first set with a new&nbsp;box&nbsp;design, I like what I'm seeing. The box is about seventy percent of the size of the older Â£10 set boxes (eg. Mandalorian or Clone Trooper Battle Pack) and is much squarer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The box art depicts a fight scene between the three figures included in the set, Captain Jack Sparrow and two Zombie Pirates, crashing through the Captain's Cabin (or furniture from it at least). The background is a room with wooden walls like on a ship! There is also a small label on the bottom right corner which reads 'Poster Inside', very informative...</div><div><br></div><div>However it is once we get inside the box that things start to get really interesting, after many years of complaints about crumpled instructions or sticker sheets it seem&nbsp;that&nbsp;the Lego&nbsp;company&nbsp;has finally listened! The instructions, the poster and the collectors card are placed inside a translucent bag with a correctly sized piece of cardboard to keep them nice and flat, fantastic! The instructions are the same as always with no mistakes and I had no missing pieces. The poster is also quite nice with a picture of Captain Jack Sparrow on one side, and all of the Pirates of the Caribbean&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;on the other. Even the collectors card has its merits, with a nice labelled image of Jack Sparrow and on the reverse, a code which can be entered on the Lego website to access something. All in all, great packaging!</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are one of the main reasons for me this set was money well spent, there are some really nice new pieces, my favourites are of course Jack's hair, the ship in a bottle (which we get two of), the new sword sheath and the brilliant globe (it's good to see that they didn't leave out the little old UK). The round map piece is pretty good too, and it is nice to see the bones introduced with the Ninjago sets again. The accessories we get are four Cutlasses (including one spare), one flintlock pistol and Jack's compass, which is printed on a dark blue one by one tile. There are no stickers in this set, so for sticker haters out there, this is a good set for you! There are also twenty gold elements in the set, meaning that about twenty two percent of the pieces are gold!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>We get three&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;in this set, of course Captain Jack Sparrow, a&nbsp;necessity in any Pirates of the Caribbean set&nbsp;, and two zombies, with creepy white eyes and very detailed printing.&nbsp;</p><p>I would have to say the best minifigure is probably the black zombie, who wears the sheath and an eye patch, he is also wearing grey trousers and is topless, but for a studded belt and a sash, holding what looks like a chain of some sort, he has his muscles on show, and several small&nbsp;tattoos&nbsp;including one on the back of his head. As well as having printing on the back of his head, he also has printing on the back of his torso of the rest of the sash. The other zombie is very nice as well with a double sided face (one side is menacing, and the other side is sort of neutral, both have tattoos), he has long black hair which is not often seen I don't think, so that is nice to have. They even took the trouble to give him back printing (a brown belt) even though it is mostly obscured by his hair! On the front of his torso he has a torn shirt and the rest of the brown belt. These two zombie pirate&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;also feature in the Queen Anne's Revenge set so that is&nbsp;interesting. The Jack Sparrow Minifigure is just what I had hoped it to be, it is hugely detailed both front and back, with belts, holsters, buckles and a red and white&nbsp;handkerchief which hangs from his belt and is printed on his trousers. His head is double sided with one a happy face, and the other a scared face (or his coward face as I like to call it) both are highly detailed with his moustache and tiny beard. His hairpiece is amazing, the detail is phenomenal and the braiding is great, I love the red&nbsp;bandanna&nbsp;around his head as well. He also comes with a lovely compass which features in every Pirates of the Caribbean set I believe!</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very short and easy, it took at most ten minutes but did incorporate some nice building techniques, such as the way the brilliant globe is fitted onto its stand, and how the table legs are attached to the table by a gold wheel with four spokes.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The overall look of the set is fantastic and with some small adjustments can be incorporated into the Queen Anne's Revenge set without much trouble. The table looks quite nice with the burning torch, goblet and map, the globe is brilliant with an old weathered look to it and the cabinet is very nice as well with ample storage space to put the two ships in a bottle on display. The bones and skull look great on it.</p><p>The&nbsp;playability&nbsp;for this set seems quite high to me as you have all the scenery, weapons and most&nbsp;importantly&nbsp;characters you need for a battle!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Overall I would have to advise you, when it comes available in your area to purchase this set, it looks great on display for those of you who would not wish to play with it, and certainly leaves room for expansion with your own Lego parts. As the film 'Pirates of the Caribbean, On&nbsp;Stranger&nbsp;Tides' has yet to be released I&nbsp;unfortunately&nbsp;cannot comment on its accuracy to the film, but given the great job Lego usually does, I can't think it could be very far off!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Overall - 10/10</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"parchioso","2011-05-13T12:00:19.43Z","Get it for the bones","<p>The bones is the key reason why I bought this set, but this small lego set from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme does have something else nice to offer, the pieces of structure are simple but interesting, I like the bottle rack a lot, using just a few simple parts, this is a two stories rack with movable bottle holder, the bottles with printed pattern are also valuable. The table with Skeleton legs isn't too appealing to me, the Globe holder is just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set offers a few special parts, the globe can be something that attracts people to get this set, it can probably be very useful for decorating a reading room, the printed map tile is also nice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The zombie minifigs are nice but if minifigs are what you are after, IMHO other sets such as 4192 would be more worth buying (you can get Blackbeard from 4192, which IMHO is a very impressive minifig), Jack is definitely a main character here, but you can have him from many other sets as well (There are two variants), so minifigs would probably not the key focus on this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the bones is why I got it, the other stuffs together makes the spending more worthwhile.<br/></p>

"AETerry","2011-05-09T17:51:50.12Z","Captain's Cabin Review","<p>When the PoTC movies first came out, a liscensed deal with Mega Bloks had been made, so any brick sets available at that time were all Mega Blok brand and just horrible looking. And I remember shaking my head and going I have plenty of LEGO Pirate sets already, I'll stick with those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Stranger Tides coming out, a new liscense deal is out and its with LEGO and I have to say, with the box art they look great and on opening a set to build, I am further not disappointed.&nbsp; And with the Captain's Cabin set, I bought two of this due to smallness, the whole wanting extras of new pieces such as the globe and bottles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has a price tag of $11.99 which shows that there's inflation we're dealing with and for a moment, the size of the box threw me before I remembered that LEGO is doing smaller boxes to cut down on wasted packing and a box this size is what would hold a $5-6 set. That aside, the box art is just stunning. Better then Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Captain Jack Sparrow as I commented in another review is worthy of the Collectible Minifigures line of quality for the print design and head piece. The other two Zombie Pirate minifigures are more closer to quality of the Indiana Jones and Prince of Persia minifigures, they're good. But not that good. One of them does feature the new accessory piece of a scabbard to hold his sword.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you get is basically what I feel are three mini-builds to fill out a scenario set ala - The Captain's Cabin where Jack Sparrow is battling it out with a couple of Zombies. I'm sure when the new movie comes out, we'll better understand the scene. The first mini-build is for the table with skeleton legs to hold it up, it holds a pearl gold cup, torch and printed tile map piece. My only quibble with the table is it's design, the table top spins and isn't stationary. I'm not partial to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other mini-build is for the globe and it's stand and that's just a very fun piece to look at and why I bought two of this set. One set to keep together and the other to incorporate into MOCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final mini-build is for the bottle rack. The build is slightly repetitive for making the shelves, and has fun detailing of the long bones and skeleton head to sugget it's made of bones? Plus you can place the two new bottle accessories on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all the set isn't bad and was very fun to grab up and put together, I am glad I outwaited the infernal Mega Blok brand/liscensing done with PoTC and saw that a liscense deal was eventually made with LEGO and to see some better quality sets come out. Especially where looks-wise is concerned.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4

The set is displayed clearly so you can get a good look at the different parts.The&nbsp;instruction manual is good as always with a clear background and good&nbsp;distinction&nbsp;between different&nbsp;colours&nbsp;although Screaming Child still takes over the back page. Also including is a small card with a picture of the Jack Sparrow minifigure with a code on the back. I believe this unlocks content on either the Video game of the theme or the Website. Finally there is a double-sided poster included, it is not a large size but bigger than A4. Unfortunately as the box is small, it comes folded which is a shame. One side is a spoof of a movie poster which looks a bit strange but the other side has a selection of minifigures in comedic situations like Gibbs about to hit a soldier with a chicken leg which I prefer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall I think this a great set if you are a MOCist or a collector but for play value it's not great.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,2,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-11-17T17:58:42.623Z","Integration Necessity","<p>Set #4191 Captain's Cabin: This is my first ever PotC set and I feel it's a pretty good set for the price, however as the title suggests I really think this set should be combined with Queen Anne's Revenge (if possible) to truly make the most out of it. Now on with the review.</p>
<p>Priced at 15$ CND this set is part of the On Stranger Tides sub-theme of LEGO PotC, it features some nifty parts and great looking Mini-Figs, unfortunately the models are... Well they look great, however they are more of a set piece really compared to similar priced sets in other Licensed Themes. Not exactly a Battle Pack, however a decent choice for LEGO to offer MF enthusiasts on a budget.</p>
<p>The main model of the set is a section of deck-plating and the Ship-in-Bottles rack found inside Blackbeard's Cabin aboard his ship from the movie (sadly Blackbeard wasn't included in this set, nor was his daughter (whose name escapes me at the moment) personally if you're going to make a 14.99$ set for a Licensed Theme I believe it should include four Mini-Figs. The model is fairly clever in its design, I would have to say though if you wanted a truly accurate shelving unit you'd need at least two or more of the parts used in its construction. (Especially the bottles with the printed ships on them.)</p>
<p>One great thing about the main model is the inclusion of the Ninjago Bone Weapon piece for decoration, it turns a simple and fast build into something spooky and hints of voodoo from Blackbeard. The rest of the pieces in this set are used to build two additional set pieces from the Captain's Cabin, a small round table with a sea chart, golden chalice and torch on it. (I love the use of the skeleton feet pieces as table legs, and the gold ships' steering wheel.)<br/>And lastly, a very detailed and first for LEGO, globe of the Earth. (On a pedastal.)</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say the models are all spectacularly designed and perfect for MOCing into any display piece, the only trouble is getting the bottles to face the correct way when sitting on the shelves. (Such tiny pieces can be tricky to position just so.) The ship printing is only visible on one side, rather unfortuante that, it should have at least been printed on both sides.</p>
<p>Now on to the Mini-Figs. Blackbeard employed Zombies as his crew and Captain Sparrow is facing two of them down in this set. The bald one I belive is considered the first mate and the one with hair is just a plain ordinary type. Both zombies have different skin tones, different printing, double-sided torso printing and freaky looking facial expressions. The one with hair also has a double-sided print on his head, one with closed mouth the other open showing his teeth. Hairy get's a cutlass and a flintlock pistol, baldy get's one cutlass with the new scabbard piece designed by LEGO for use with PotC sets. (It's about time they decided to make this piece, all the Classic Pirates Theme sets could have stood to have this designed a long time ago.) The set comes with four cutlasses, I stuck the extra one in Baldy's scabbard for storage and so it won't get lost.</p>
<p>Jack is great, this version is not dressed up in all of his regalia, he's lacking the hat, overcoat and other accoutrements found on his person when he's full-on Captain mode. However what he is dressed in looks stellar with the print, I noticed upon closer inspection that his bare chest visible on the torso seems to be a darker skin tone than his hands or face. If he's meant to be tanned it should personally be in all visible skin areas. A 1x1 Tile is printed with the compass which does not point North, you get two in the set in case you lose one, and Jack also wields a Cutlass. (I was a bit dissapointed that LEGO didn't try to personalize the PotC MFs weapons more, it's alright if the generic baddies and things use the old style cutlass, however Sparrow, Barbossa and the other main characters should have recived new swords.)</p>
<p>I also can't talk about this set without bringing up the great looking Jack Sparrow hair piece. It's sculpted perfectly and includes all of the key details, in the sculpt and in the print designs. I'd have to say this is a must own set for PotC and Pirates fans in general, it has a lot to offer in such a small box. Including a special PotC Poster and collectible character card with code for the LEGO PotC site. I especially applaud LEGO for giving us three Mini-Figs with double-sided torsos in this one set an two double-sided heads (Jack has two different expressions). I can't help feeling though that they could have included the woman from this scene in the movie too, as she's only really available in much more expensive sets. Either that or perhaps a third zombie would have been a nice bonus. Still highly recommended.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,5

On to the review!</p><p>First the minifigures:Captain Jack Sparow.This is a realy realy cool new figure, he has a dublesided body and a head thats dublesided,one normel and one in fear,his hair is amazingly detailed with his dreadlocks and bandana that contiues around the back,also it has the beads and litlle metel thing, just realy cool.His chest shows his blue shirt and a belt acrossed ithe also has supreb leg printing decipting the scerf thing.</p><p>The Gunner:Ok,this is cool too because he has a new piece, the sword holder,it works a little like the indana jones pouch it has a slit for a sword!Anyhow he has duble sided printing on his chest and head,you have to look carefully on the back of his head to see the tatooes,but he has a eye patch and his mouth is sewn shut.Real clasic zombie.</p><p>The Yeoman:This guy&nbsp;has a gun and a sword,he,like everybody else,has dublesided chest and head one side looks calmish(if you could call a zombiefied pirate calm looking!)and the other has a snarl that revils some nasty teeth.His chest has aripped shirt and a few teeth here and there.&nbsp; Thats it for the figures.</p><p>The Cabin:The skeleton motif from the Queen Anna's Revange caries on into the cabin,the tables legs are made from real skeleton legs(haha pun!)and on top theres a round tile which decipts the map to the grial, proble stolen from jack.The globe and stand are anouther cool new rare piece, at a glance it looks like a marble but its actuly two piece!!</p><p>The rack or cabinet thingy: Again realy cool!

"Ernst","2012-06-28T18:50:09.62Z","Nice scene, great parts, hard to give it a place.","<p>Overall 4 bricks : My first PotC set, definitly a nice looking set. It comes with 3 great minifigures, it is filled with great parts and when finished it looks very good. The only problem is in my opinion where to ""place"" it. It is probably a scene taken from&nbsp;one of the PotC&nbsp;movies and hard to fit in with other sets but I guess you that's the problem with more licensed theme's. Maybe you can integrate it in one of the PotC big ships, but overall a very nice set that invites you to get more PotC sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : First the small table with globe, very inventive and stable. The bigger map table with skeleton legs&nbsp;is nice too, table can turn and just big enough. Third built is the bottle rack, a stable piece of furniture, looks very realistic and is&nbsp;built&nbsp;with nice pieces like the torches and gold bricks. A nice result all the way with eye for details, not very hard to do though so 3 bricks are sufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : The set is filled with great parts starting with the 3 minifigures : Jack Sparrow with double sided head&nbsp;and 2 zombiepirates. Other good parts are the Globe off course, map and compass, the 2 bottles and the bones. In fact all the parts are usefull in&nbsp;good colors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 3 bricks : allthough it looks great, the set has not that much playing options other than Jack Sparrow defeating the Zombies. Perhaps if you own more PotC sets it improves but&nbsp;the set is hard to integrate in older Pirates sets so 3 bricks will do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : Going MISB price in Holland is some â¬12,50 which is a good price for a nice set like this with 3 minifigures and a load of good parts.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,5

All three figures have tons of printed detail and look great, with the small exception of the bald head on one zombie which looks a little awkward with the exposed head stud, which contrasts with the otherwise exceptional detailing on the characters.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Play and Special Features:</b></div><div><br></div><div>As an entry level set, there are no real special features in this set. &nbsp;This set is more of a mini-figure and accessory set than anything. &nbsp;It gives you some great detail features to use in other pirates sets (the globe and table would look great in the 4193 London Escape building or in the cabin of 4195 The Queen Anne's Revenge) or even other theme sets. &nbsp;The furniture does give the characters something to interact with and play around and as mentioned above, the whole set can be used to improve the look and playability of other Pirates of the Caribbean sets!</div><div><br></div><div>Check out the blog link in my profile for more reviews and photos!</div>",TRUE,3,4,2,2,3

"legoreviewer778","2011-12-06T02:13:27.28Z","Awesome Set!","The build was fantastic, for a couple of reasons. It was joyful, good price per piece ratio, lots of new parts and great mini figures. When I opened the box, I was really surprised. I can't remember if the bags were numbered or not, but the thing that I really liked about this set, is that it had a&nbsp;collectible&nbsp;poster and a&nbsp;collectors&nbsp;card along with a manual and they all came in cardboard backing! So no bent up cards, no screwed up manuals... I think that's actually really cool! The set also had several pieces that came in special baggies, such as; the 2 hemispheres for the globe and Captain Jack's hair and a couple more... and the other thing that I really liked about this set, is that it had no stickers! Not only that, but it also had several printed pieces as well!&nbsp;Check out the instructions at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://us.service.lego.com/en-US/BuildingInstructions/default.aspx"">http://us.service.lego.com/en-US/BuildingInstructions/default.aspx</a><div><br></div><div>The figures were pretty nice as well. It's not like it has any exclusive figures, but I think it's still pretty cool. The Captain Jack figure comes in like 3 or 4 other sets, but I think his still really cool to get, even for the 3 or 4th time. The 2 zombies each came in 1 or 2 other sets, but again it's still pretty cool to get them. This set is also really good because it's the smallest set of the line, but the 2 zombie figures only come in set 4194 and 4195 and they're both fairly expensive. So if you want to get the figures and you don't want to pay for a $120US set, then feel free to do so. Take a look at the parts, figures, stickers, counterparts, alternatives and much more at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=4191-1"">http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=4191-1</a></div><div><br></div><div>Yeah the set is okay. Now I think the value for money is fantastic and same goes for the piece count. Playability is okay, but there is not much to really to play with. The set is pretty decent and even if I had to, I don't think I would add anything that hasn't already been added, it's just nearly-perfect!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>First off, is the globe. The globe is pretty nice and fairly accurate. I like the way they did the stand for it and I also like how it spins 360 degrees. Not much else, it's kind of a filler. One thing I do like to mention though, the 2 hemispheres are on a cone and that's the clipping point. You have to be careful though, because you might accidentally knock the globe off and the cone piece gets stuck in there. However it's pretty easy to fix and I'm kind of nit picking here.</div><div><br></div><div>Next is the table. Yeah not much either, it's kind of a filler as well... but it looks pretty decent. The skeleton legs are pretty accurate, but they're kind of finicky at times. The bottom of the table (where the skeleton legs are joined onto) spins, which I guess is somewhat cool as well, but like I said it can be pretty annoying at times. there is a printed map piece that's also included in set 4192. There is also a flame and a gold cup.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cabin itself is pretty detailed and accurate. So the basic idea is, there are 2 bottles on 2 shelves and Captain Jack is supposed to fight off the zombies with them. I think having the shelf is a pretty cool idea, but the bottles always fall out. I also like the printing of the ship on the bottle, I think it's cute!</div><div><br></div><div>PROS:</div><div>- Great price per piece ratio&nbsp;</div><div>- Great value for money-poster, card, cardboard backing etc.</div><div>- Lot's of accessories to add to the overall effect</div><div>- Several of printed parts, great for a set that's $10 or so&nbsp;</div><div>- NO STICKERS</div><div><br></div><div>CONS:</div><div>- The bottles can be a real pain sometimes (they fall out of the shelves), even when you're transporting the set</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, you should definitely buy this set if you like Pirates Of The Caribbean a lot, or if you like sets that have printed pieces instead of stickers. It's also great for the pieces, mini figures, everything! Try not to miss it!</div><div><br></div><div>If you want more of my opinion on this set, go to my You Tube channel, it's where you can watch my reviews on all sets I own: http://www.youtube.com/user/legoreviewer778</div><div><br></div><div>If this review was helpful to you, press ""yes""!</div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
"B_Scheibs","2012-06-04T13:52:00.983Z","Excellent Little Set For Your Money!","The smallest set from the Pirates of the Caribbean line is 4191- The Captain's Cabin. It has 3 minifigures, 95 pieces, and costs 11.99, a very nice price, putting us at 12.6 cents, a decent price for a licensed set. Let me start out by saying this is one of the BEST 10-13 dollar sets out there. Another cool thing is the box, which is a lot smaller than most other ones, which I like! However, I'm starting to see that the box size has gone up to the normal box sizes. Without further to do, let's talk about the figures.<br><br>Jack Sparrow comes in all of the Pirates of the Caribbean sets, and this is the cheapest way to get him. It has a very swashbuckling feel to it, and has a brand new hair sculpt, making the figure stand out! He has two faces, and his very famous compass, which you get two of! The jacket is double sided and very nicely printed, and the legs are very nice as well. The first zombie is the gunner zombie. It is very ugly, yet very detailed. There are tattoos on his chest and around the back of his head, and the face is very detailed, especially the eye patch. The torso is nicely printed both front and back, but the legs are blank. The best part is the new sword sheath, which holds cutlasses pretty well. The yeoman zombie is also ugly, and has a calm and angry face. Both are very nicely detailed with plenty of printing and detail. The torso features a nice torn red jacket, showing his chest, and continues on the back, even though only the bottom part is printed. Like the gunner zombie, the legs are unprinted. Now onto the set!<br><br>First is the table, which has a chalice, a torch, and the nicely printed Mao Kun map! The skeleton legs are very cool, and the table is able to rotate. My only problem is that it's too tall, but overall, it's pretty good.<br><br>Next is the globe, and I absolutely LOVE it! The stand is perfectly built, simple, but very nice! The globe is dark tan, and comes in two halves, which are very well printed. They snap together around a gold cone, and is very sturdy. The look of it is phenomenal, and is an awesome piece worth having!<br><br>Lastly comes the bottle rack, which features great pieces from the brown telescopes to the giant bones. The rack is nicely built, and the shelves hold the bottles nicely. These bottles are excellent, and have ships printed on them, ships Blackbeard destroyed. Surely enough, one of them is probably the Black Pearl! You get two, and that is excellent. Overall, the entire set is just great!<br><br>It doesn't stop there. Also included is a poster and card, which come in cardboard packaging along with the instructions. The poster shows all of the figures from the entire line on one side, and an advertisement for the Pirates of the Caribbean video game on the other. The cards only come in On Stranger Tides sets, and this one has Jack Sparrow on it. On the back is a special code for the website on LEGO.com. <br><br>Overall, I love this set! It has 3 great figures, a nice selection of new and printed parts, and I think everyone will have fun playing and fiddling around with it! It stayed accurate to the movie, and feels like Blackbeard's cabin for sure! The set is very fun to have, and I think there is some good value, especially with the globe and bottles. I think this little set is a 5 out of 5 set, and worth the 12 bucks. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading this review, and thanks for checking it out!- BrickLife4809<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
