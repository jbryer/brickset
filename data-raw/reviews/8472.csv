"Niallskie","2011-04-20T01:24:36.46Z","Fountain of Youth keeps me young","<p>My second review for the PotC sets and i just build this set a couple of minutes back. This set is&nbsp;fantastic, a great addition to the Captain Cabin's I just reviewed. There was a couple of disappointment at this set, dont get me wrong I do love this set very much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, when i open it disappointment struck as there was no backing board for the instruction so my intruction was bent as well as the free poster. Price is according but would be better if it was a little lower, if not an additional minifigure is added and it would be great. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love this set, the fountain was amazing, enginously concieved as well as the water falls. I also love the color combination and the pillars on the water falls. Minifigures are fantastic, ofcourse Jack Sparrow is a given, Barbosa is alright but Brick Beard I mean Black Beard is a Winner. I do love the beard and the new pirate hat he has, his sword is also great and not the usual gray sword. The sword holder still amazes me, would have been nice if theres and extra one in the box. The plastic water fall is fantastic as well, reminds me of the freezer curtain that are used in the kitchen. All in all i love this set, I guess im at the point where I might love all the PotC sets. This is a good buy if you are thinking of buying it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"CapnRex101","2011-04-23T18:35:31.567Z","4192 - Fountain of Youth (Aqua de Vida)","<p>Another good set from the Pirates of the Caribbean line, perhaps not a&nbsp;stand-out&nbsp;one, but very nice nonetheless. I would have to say that the figures are the main draw to this set for me (with Blackbeard being the highlight), although the scenery is useful as well.</p><p>You get great&nbsp;playability with this set so I feel for a younger audience this one is a winner but the display value leaves something to be desired, it is by no means a bad set, but I think there are better ones from this range.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is a little smaller than would normally be expected for a Â£20 set, like most of the new boxes. But what I find really interesting about this set is its name. Although I have only heard it called Fountain of Youth, on the box they call this set Aqua de Vida, which 'almost' means water of life in Spanish, notice that I said 'almost' as the actual Spanish word for water is Agua, maybe a mistake, or maybe it is intentional, we may never know! The box art shows Blackbeard and Barbossa&nbsp;sword fighting in the foreground, with Captain Jack Sparrow sneaking towards the fountain of youth to steal the prize. The background is a rocky wall, as presumably this scene takes place in a cave, at the moment we cannot tell as the film has not yet been released!&nbsp;</p><p>The instructions were just fine, no mistakes in the instructions and no missing pieces for me. Of course as with most new sets the instructions were packed in a cardboard backed bag with the poster and collector card which in this set is of Hector Barbossa with a peg leg which adds a little further incentive to buy it for people who would be keen to collect the cards.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are several interesting and useful parts in this set. The waterfall which is made from a soft plastic sheet is nicely detailed and has two slits in it to allow a minifigure to walk through it. However my favourite pieces in this set are certainly Blackbeard's hat and beard, which both look incredible! Blackbeard's sword also looks really nice, with a golden hilt and a very angular look to it. Of course Jack Sparrow's hairpiece is nice, with his bandanna, and I also like Barbossa's hat, which has been seen many times before but has now got new printing on it. Another&nbsp;stand-out&nbsp;piece is the top of the fountain, a translucent blue&nbsp;concave&nbsp;disc is printed with some foam to give the impression of gushing water, and I think it works well!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The figures as I said earlier are lovely, Jack Sparrow is nice with detailed printing of his belt, handkerchief, two silver buckles and his dark blue jacket. He also features a double sided face, one side is happy, and one side is afraid. Barbossa is also really well done with a lovely blue jacket, a nice bearded face and a peg leg, which I really like. He also wears one of the new sheaths in black.</p><p>But Blackbeard is an absolute triumph. Unbelievable, certainly my favourite Pirates of the Caribbean Minifigure so far. The black legs are hugely detailed with studded coat tails, the torso has back printing and, like Jack Sparrow, he has many buckles, bandoleers and belts on both sides of his torso. But the best part is the head. The beard is extremely detailed with plaited hair and great texture, I am not quite sure what the grey and yellow bits are, but they look fine, so great. The face itself is really good with a black beard and moustache and a distinctly furrowed brow. The hat is probably my favourite part though, a brand new mould, which besides being an all new piece, is printed on the top with metal plates, presumably to strengthen the hat, turning it in to almost a helmet! The new sword looks great as well with a huge gold hilt and a dull silver blade. We also get a standard skeleton, a nice inclusion but this is all that can be said for it really.</p><p>The other&nbsp;accessories included are three cutlasses&nbsp;and Captain Jack Sparrow's compass, featured in every Pirates of the Caribbean set. We also get the same round map found in set 4191, Captain's Cabin.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is quite short, taking&nbsp;approximately&nbsp;fifteen minutes. There are no especially&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;building techniques in this set as far as I can tell but the dark green parts are a welcome addition and are well used.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The fountain itself is quite effective, it must be quite a difficult thing to design I imagine, but I think it is well executed. You get a lot of water pieces in this set, which could be quite useful for MOCing. The golden goblets look very good when displayed next to the fountain, contrasting well with the duller colours of the rocks.&nbsp;</p><p>The waterfall looks great too, with the new pillar pieces introduced with the new Atlantis sets featuring heavily. The rocky effects are well done and as I previously said the waterfall looks brilliant.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>I would advise people to buy this set, it is not a compulsory buy, but is worth having, and if you cannot afford the Queen Anne's Revenge then this is the only other set which includes Blackbeard, a great Minifigure, it is almost worth buying just for that! The only reason I do not give this set a higher score is because it lacks the 'Wow' factor for me, considering that I give this set...</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Overall - 8/10</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"parchioso","2011-05-05T11:02:02.733Z","Get Blackbeard for the right price from this set","<p>Many folks have done helpful reviews on this set, and I kind of agree that the plastic waterfall curtain may disappoint some people, and the way it is hang does not look like a thoughtful design, but on the other hand, perhaps some real lego experts can turn this into something better.</p>

<p><br/>But the minifigs from this set or perhaps from the whole theme are truly excellent, Blackbeard is especially interesting as the bread piece is so nicely designed, and his sword is also very special! I think this is the set to have Blackbeard other than 4195 Queen Anne's Revenge, which relatively costs more. And for people who would only collect a few but not all of the minifigs in this set, especially for a casual player who are not a fan of this film, but just want to get a set to experience, this set can be a good candidate, especially due to the price range. </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"benjadude11","2011-05-01T17:54:31.393Z","The Shower Curtain of Youth","I got it, along with Captain's Cabin, to kick off my PotC collection. I couldn't decide between this set and Isla de la Muerta, but at the last second i chose this one because I thought the waterfall would be a really handy piece for MOCing.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Boy, was I wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>First of all, the waterfall isn't even a piece. It's just a rubber curtain that hangs down over the entrance. it's attached to the archway by two black hook pieces (which should be gray) and falls in three sections. The idea, as I gleaned from the box, is that the characters can walk through the waterfall, but that's silly, because they can't even do that without lifting up one of the three flaps. So, not only is the piece useless from here on out, but it doesn't eve serve the function that it gave up so much for.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also, the shower curtain/waterfall piece is a much duller blue than the pieces in the actual fountain, and looks dull and lack-luster when placed next to the shiny, glimmering trans-blue of the fountain.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Which, by the way, looks excellent. Because of the translucent qualities of the blue bricks, you can see the intricate innards of the brick, which a) kind of looks like water and b) is the only part of the construction that comes close to matching the detail of the figs, who are ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Jack Sparrow is neat, his hair is solid plastic, not rubber (yesss!) and his torso is intricately painted, the dark-red-dark-blue-brown color scheme giving him the perfect personality. His face, though two-sided, is magnificent, also capturing his clumsy swagger very well.</div><div><br></div><div>Barbossa is fine, I can't really tell if he's supposed to be a pirate or, like an English naval policeman guy, since I haven't seen the movie. Two thumbs up on the peg-leg and the sword sheath, and innovation I hope to see more of soon.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Which brings me to Blackbeard. He is totally awe-inspiring, from his dramatic, flamboyant hat, to his evil, hungry eyes, to his thick, dark, namesake, (his beard) to his studded, gothic-style pants. He's a great fig, but his sword puts him over the top. The gold hilt with the curvy hand guard matches the menacing notch in the top perfectly. he is a total monster, embodying to the fullest extent that a minifig can the awesome age of swashbuckling anti-heroes. I place him solidly in the Top 10 figs of all time.</div><div><br></div><div>So, overall: lame waterfall + cool fountain + amazing figs = this thing is way overpriced for what it's really worth. If this isn't on sale, just save up and get the Queen Ann's Revenge, because it has all these figs and is probably a way, way better set.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,2,3,4,2

"David1971","2011-08-20T16:28:49.37Z","The shower curtain of ... mixed feelings","<p>Well after you've seen the review by 'benjadude11' (posted 1 May 2011) entitled 'The Shower Curtain of Youth', it's hard not to think of that phrase when reviewing the set, although in fact I can't help thinking of it as 'The Shower Curtain of Doom' (influenced by either the second Indiana Jones movie, or the eighty-fifth Doctor Who story, take your pick).</p><p>So is 'The Shower Curtain of Doom' a rubbish set? Well no, not really. Or not quite. I have built many Lego sets of all shapes and sizes over the years, and I am coming to think that a set at the Â£20-Â£25 kind of price point is perhaps the best sort. In this case, for instance, you get three very nice minifigs (plus a skeleton); and some other stuff to build; it comes in a nice box, with a little poster and a card as well as the instructions, kept tidily in a plastic bag with a board so it doesn't get duffed up in transit; and it all comes in an attractively designed and rather glossy box.</p><p>So, to sit down with a set of this kind, of an evening, and spend a happy half-hour building it, is one of life's pleasures.</p><p>To be more specific about this set: well Blackbeard, and pegleg Barbossa, are especially impressive minifigs. The fountain is fine but not something you'd especially want, under normal circumstances, and the same goes for the waterfall thing, although now we've called it 'The Shower Curtain of Doom' I kind of have a soft spot for it, even though (or perhaps because) it's a bit stupid.</p><p>So overall it's a bit daft, but quite nice. I enjoyed this Â£20 set and the other Â£20 set, #4181, 'Isla de la Muerta', although that one is rather better because you get a Lego Keira Knightley and various nice touches, such as green apples, a turntable and a boat.</p><p>But I would welcome more Â£20 sets with 3 or 4 minifigs and some interesting junk, but ideally in future the junk would be more interesting and less, um, stupid.

Anyhoo.<br><br>MINIFIGS<div>Well, Captain Jack Sparrow is the minifigure we all know and love. He's got his trademark mop of hair, which is nicely detailed and the norm in half of the POTC sets, and his characteristic smirk that can change into terror when you flip it around. At the rate of Jacks in sets at the moment, you'll soon have a Jack face for every occasion.<br><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The draw in this set, perhaps the only draw, is the other two minifigs - Blackbeard and Privateer Barbossa. The former is only available in two sets - this and The Queen Anne's Revenge, and if you don't want to break the bank, 4192 is the way to go. Blackbeard is new everything - new face, new hat, new torso, even a NEW weapon. The hat is Davy Jones' with a colour swap and a metal band printing on the crown and looks rather smashing if I may say so. The torso is all black and buckles, double printed and very much like the movie. The face, whilst not exactly like Ian McShane's, does convey the ""badass pirate"" rather well. The beard is included with fuses, which looks a little goofy, but there are a variety of black dwarf beards from the '07 Castle range that can fill in if you so desire.

"AETerry","2011-05-11T13:33:53.687Z","Fountain of Youth Review","<p>When the PoTC movies first came out, a liscensed deal with Mega Bloks had been made, so any brick sets available at that time were all Mega Blok brand and just horrible looking. And I remember shaking my head and going I have plenty of LEGO Pirate sets already, I'll stick with those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Stranger Tides coming out, a new liscense deal is out and its with LEGO and I have to say, with the box art they look great and on opening a set to build, I am further not disappointed. This set depicts one of the scenes from the upcoming movie too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start off, you get 3 minifigures, 4 when you count the skeleton. There's nothing special about the skeleton other then a prop piece for the set. The other minifigures of Jack Sparrow, Barbossa and Blackbeard are all spectacular and worthy of the Collectible Minifigure Series line of quality. Jack Sparrow is starting to get redundant as he's in all of the PoTC sets I've gotten so far. Barbossa and Blackbeard aren't so repeatative. Barbossa is even a different print design and different from the Isla de Muerta set. Blackbeard sports a new beard and hat piece I've not seen yet and he weilds a new, very fancy looking cutlass sword with gold handle. It just knocks the socks off any previous pirate style swords LEGO has done and is using in the PoTC theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My piece de resistance' though was for the Fountain in this set, with the clear translucent blue bricks for the water and it's build. A printed tile piece for the top where the water culminates with gysering out of the fountain. Very fun to build and good pieces, details there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other part to this set is the waterfall where the minifigures are supposed to pass through to get to the fountain. I like the column pieces, been wanting more of those from 2011 Atlantis. The arch for the cave entrance is descent and solid enough. And then you have a thin piece of plastic printed to look like water and slits in it that minifigures are suppose to pass through? If I'm going to display the entire set somewhere it looks alright. For play... not so much. It feels like LEGO cheapened out there. I was reminded of a waterfall piece from the Crystal Skull Temple in the Indiana Jones theme that I liked far better. This plastic sheet is at least able to be attached and hang decently from the back and stay put as a result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The instructions and folded poster that come with the set are in a seal package with cardboard to help keep them flat and not getting bent or folded. At $19.99, I do feel the set is worth it... just for the minifigures and fountain alone. </p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall-I give this a 4/5. They don't have Angelica and it's pretty pricey for 20.00 US dollars. It's still fun to play with. I hope this helped.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,2
"itsaturkey","2011-12-10T23:09:18.587Z","Well, I think Lego got the name wrong...","Ok, I'm going to start the review with this note; This set has absolutely NOTHING to do with final battle of OST. The Fountain of Youth wasn't actually a 'Fountain', it was more of a rock that water came out of. And I don't know where the water fall comes in to all of this... But I will focus on the parts etc before getting to the accuracy of this set to the movie.<br><br>Waterfall: Despite what the pictures look like, this is actually rubber, not like the falls from the Indiana Jones Crystal Skull Temple Water fall. Personally I don't the rubber, but it's really more of a preference. Ten grey 2x2 spire pieces are included, along with two that are tan. Also two Atlantis Key holders are included, great if you have keys but no place to put them. Two seaweed pieces are strung to the side. Although a bit fragile and having nothing to do with the movie, this is a nice little decor able piece to the set.<br><br>Fountain: There are some great light blue Florescent pieces in this part, along with a dark green half rock, quite rare. The mix of dark green, gold and light blue gives it a tropical, cave-ish feel, which is what it should look like. Not much else to say about it, except it's only half of a water fountain, I don't know why Lego couldn't finish it...<br><br>Minifigs: Three minifigs are included, Jack Sparrow, Hector Barbossa and Blackbeard. Jack Sparrow is the same Jack Sparrow of most every other set, nothing special here. Barbossa on the other hand is exclusive to this set, and is clad in Privateer clothing. He has a pegleg and Admirals hat. Blackbeard is included in this set plus the QAR. He has a beard piece similar to that of dwarfs, and unique hat. His awesome sword is sadly rubber. Also a skeleton is included... Don't know where he came in to the movie...<br><br>Accessories: Two gold cups, a map and a compass. Gold cups are always welcome in my book, and are somewhat rare. The map is extremely rare and interesting. The compass is as usual (Misprinted of course :)<br><br>Relation to the Movie: Beside the Minifigs, none. First off, the two cups are supposed to be SILVER, not GOLD. [Spoiler Alert] And Gibbs burns the map at the beginning of the movie! And what's with the random Waterfall? And the Fountain that looks nothing like that of the movie. That is not to say it's not beautiful, just not accurate. This would have been much better if it was accurate to the film.<br><br>Overall: A nice little set, but little playability. The pieces are excellent, and would be better put to use in Mocing then to this set. The minifigs include two that are exclusive and rare. <br>",TRUE,3,5,2,3,3

"B_Scheibs","2012-06-04T13:10:06.57Z","The Fountain of Youth? Or not.","<p>The Fountain of Youth is a 2011 Pirates of the Caribbean Set from On Stranger Tides. It has 128 pieces, 3 great minifigures, and retails for $19.99. That is a very high price point for this set, as we have a price per piece ratio of 15.6 cents. However, there are certain good points to this set, especially the figures and nice parts. One nice thing was the cardboard packaging, keeping everything unfolded and neat. Anyways, let's get to the review.</p><p><br></p><p>The minifigures are the true stars of this set. Jack Sparrow is featured in every set from this line, but is so iconic and so detailed that it is easily forgiven. The new hair mold is especially nice and the printing on the torso and legs is flawless. Jack features both happy and scared faces, and features back printing as well. Next is Hector Barbossa, the privateer. The printing on the hat is great, and the torso is a bit simple yet very nice. Also included is new sword sheath, which is nice and holds swords pretty well without them falling out all of the time. Lastly is the one and only- Blackbeard! What an awesome figure, from the detailed rubber beard to a detailed black Davy Jones hat, this figure truly rocks! The hat was a bit different in the movie, but the figure is still absolutely fantastic! The sword is nice, but very large as well. The jacket and legs are well printed, but the printing on the back is partially covered due to the massive beard. Overall, very nice minifig selection!</p><p><br></p><p>Accessories include a skeleton, which I don't count as a minifigure since it seems more for decoration on the fountain, but is nice to have. Also included is the Mao Kun map, which got burned before the scene happened, but is well printed. Lastly are the chalices which were in the movie, but are in pearl gold instead of metallic silver. It shouldn't have been too hard to give it a new color. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Included with every Pirates of the Caribbean set is a poster. In this case, it shows a battle at the fountain with several British soldiers and Blackbeard and Barbossa fighting, and even Jack and Angelica running away. It is double sided, and the back shows the Mao Kun maps LEGO style. In every On Stranger Tides set there is an exclusive character card. In this case, we get Barbossa, and on the back there is a special code for the LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean website. Now on to the actual set!<br></p><p><br></p><p>This is NOT the Fountain of Youth from the movie at all. The Fountain of Youth is an interesting rock structure in the movie, but a completely different model in this set, sort of like a water spring. It doesn't even come close to resembling it in the movie, so I wondered how LEGO could have gone wrong. Anyways, the water pieces and the dark green pieces are nice, especially the printed water disk and the green boulder. Besides that, there isn't much to it.</p><p><br></p><p>The waterfall is a decent structure, with a nice use of columns and the Atlantis key pieces, but I don't really like the waterfall plastic sheet. It does have a nice effect to the set, but it looks a bit too cartoonish. It was a good try for LEGO, and it can probably be used in many creations, but to me, it just looks OK.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, this set wasn't that great. First of all- NO PLAYABILITY! It suffers from an inaccurate fountain, and an OK-ish waterfall. The piece count is lacking, but the parts you do get are pretty nice. The minifigures truly make this set worth buying, as Barbossa is exclusive and this is a cheap way to get Blackbeard. Final verdict- get it on sale for the figures, or just don't get it at all. This would have been a nice set if the fountain was the actual one from the movie, and the price was $14.99. Overall, I give this set a 2 out of 5, and is easily my least favorite set from this line. Anyways, I hope you found this review helpful, and that you enjoyed reading it! -BrickLife4809<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,2,3,3,1,2
"Lego_fan_","2019-01-01T22:44:24.74Z","Fun for little pirates","<p>This is a great set for a little pirate like I used to be. I thought I could be one but this set made me think I was. It is a great set with some cool parts. It is also cool for black beard for the money. It is not all that true to the film but is still pretty neat. I would recommend this set to any Lego fans and people who used to pretend to be a pirate.</p>
