"Niallskie","2011-04-28T01:43:43.383Z","The tower may break apart, but this set is nothing but SOLID!","<p>The last set I was able to purchase at our local Lego store and the second biggest set&nbsp;in the PotC sets is the Whitecap Bay. Glad I got everything on this set, backing board for the instructions, poster and the character card. I also like less instructions, unlike the city sets, but could have been put in just one thick&nbsp;instruction but two is fine. Sorry guys, this set has some stickers for the brick wall effect as well as the window. The light up piece for the light house is awesome (dont know that the electronic brick's called :D)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of all the set (maybe except the Queen Anne's) this&nbsp;is &nbsp;the most unique for me, minifigures alone are fantastic. The two mermaids are exclusive to this set, their fish tail design is way way better than the usual fish tail lego has before them. Scrum and Philip are alright, as well as Jack as we know... well he is in all the sets. What is with the bald pirate, he is running second with Jack Sparrow for being there in the most sets, actually 3 sets for the bald pirate. I also love the gimiks or what other call mechanism on this set. This set have a bunch on it. It has this big barrel that spills off, the cannon that fires the nets, the spot light and the collapsing light house walls that breaks into 4 chuncks. With all this, this makes the playability of this set a level higher&nbsp;on my book, and im assurred everybody will agree on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The built on this set is fantastic,&nbsp;its kinda unconventional for me but it work wonderful. The actual sets are distributed in 3 parts, where in the biggest part is the actual light house. I also love the&nbsp;big cannon that pops out of the big doors, perfect for&nbsp;capturing Mermaids.&nbsp;The two row boats are&nbsp;great addition, i do&nbsp;love the black rather than the usual brown boat. Only thing that doesnt make sense to me is the Anchor, I mean its a good addition but its really not necessary or out of place for the set. All in all, this&nbsp;set is a great purchase and I am sure that when you get this to add to your PotC set, you will not regret it.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"The_Guy_With_The_Bricks","2011-05-08T02:46:14.217Z","Yo Ho, Two Bottles of Rum and Some Crazy Mermaids!","Avast mateys! Here be a review of the new set 4194 Lego Whitecap Bay, which be designed after a scene in the upcoming movie Pirate of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. <br><br>For my full review including many more pictures, please visit <a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html"">http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html. </a><br><br>The long awaited Lego Pirates of the Caribbean theme is finally here!<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/jackatfrontdoor.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>Obviously there is no real way of knowing right now the events in the scene this is based on, but there seems to be indication that the pirates are attempting to catch a mermaid from the bay, and at some point the lighthouse blows up.<br><br>The box is well designed and decorated and filled well with pieces; when I opened it I did not suffer from the dreaded “I bought this huge box and there are only enough Legos to fill up half of the inside” sinking feeling. This is one of the bigger Lego Pirates of the Caribbean sets, and as such there are many elements to look over.<br><br>First and primarily are the minifigs, which are incredibly detailed. <br><br><span><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html"">[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/figs.jpg[/img]</a><br><br></span>Lego has outdone itself once again with the beautiful design of these figures, The names are listed on the box: first we have the most famous pirate of the century, the inimitable Jack Sparrow. <br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><br><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/jack.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>This set is one where he appears wearing his imposing tricorne hat, and as always he features a double sided head.<br><br>The other Lego minifigures included in 4194 Lego Whitecap Bay are a Lego Zombie Pirate, Lego Philip Swift, Lego mermaid Syrena, random nameless Mermaid, and Lego Scrum. The mermaids are brand new molds that beat the stuffings out of the former Lego mermaids.<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/mermaids.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>As for Scrum and Philip Swift, I have no idea who they are what role they play in the new movie, but they are well done figures with good detailing on the torsos and on Scrum's leg piece. <br><br>The buildings of Lego Whitecap Bay are split into four pieces. Each connects to the others or can be used as a stand-alone set piece.<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/frontset.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>The first is a small booby-trap design with a barrel sitting up on a few blocks and a pin that, when pulled, dumps the contents out. Also on this section is a smaller barrel filled with coins. <br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/barellspill1.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>Nothing particularly special here, and the coins in this set and the rest of the POTC's are disappointingly a new ""pearl"" color, which is dull and dreary compared to the shiny chrome coins I can remember from the Lego Pirate sets of my childhood.<br><br>The next segment is a small shack, the basic function of which is to serve as a connecting link between the other buildings. In the back, we get a shovel, a pickaxe, and one of the new bottle pieces.<br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><br><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/fronttinyshack.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>Good stuff. Let's move on.<br><br>The third building is a bit more complicated than the other two. <br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/smallbuilding.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>First, we are greeted by a large set of double doors, which swing open to reveal a comical looking cannon which fires a net when you push the button on the other side of it. <br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/smallbuildingopen.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>Eh. To be honest, I prefer to leave these door closed when displaying the set.<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/smallbuildingrear.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>I'm not sure if there is a movie reference being played off of with this cannon, but regardless it feels a bit clunky and un-realistic to me. But hey, whatever. There is room on the roof for several figures to stand as lookouts, or to have swordfights on.<br><br>The last piece of 4194 Lego Whitecap Bay is the main lighthouse itself. <br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><br><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/frontofmainbuilding.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>This is the section that contains the most goodies, and that makes the set worth buying. The lighthouse is three ""Lego stories"" tall, and stands as a quite imposing structure. It is mostly gray and brown, boring colors for Lego, but my guess is the colors were limited by the source material. Nevertheless the ""light-up"" brick is a neat feature that helps to break up the monotony.<br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><br><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/backmainbuilding.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>From behind, we see that the first floor contains a room with several neat little accessories like a sextant and more of the bottles that Jack seems so fond of.<br>Next level up is a bare room with two wheels on the wall, not sure if it's supposed to be some sort of control room. <br><br><span><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html"">[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/backgoofy.jpg[/img]</a><br><br></span>Further up is the actual lighthouse room, with the and the ""light-up"" brick is on a swivel so you can move it up and down from here. Also, the brick comes on when pushing on the back of it, an goes off when pressure is not applied. At the very top is the roof, nothing really that interesting going on up here.<br><br>The neat thing about this whole building is that it is built so that the top of it collapses, probably to reflect some kind of explosion in the movie.<br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><br><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/buildingfallingdown.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>Obviously, the structure is less than sturdy, and it doesn't take much to knock it apart. Some of the second floor walls a loose and connected by only one stud, so care is needed when moving the building around or setting figures onto it. But seeing the building shake apart is pretty neat, and the building finds just the right balance between sturdy and too fragile.<br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><br><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/buildingpieces.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>Unlike some of the ""play features"" found in other sets, this actually works.<br><br>All buildings assembled, Lego Whitecap Bay is a pretty large set, especially when the rowboats are set out in front. <br><br><span><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html"">[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/mermaidchase.jpg[/img]</a><br><br></span>There is a lot of opportunity for fun scenes with the different characters in the building areas.<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/mermaidattack.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>All sorts of neat stuff is up for grabs in here, including two of Jack's compasses, two nets, an anchor, weeds for the mermaids to whack people with, a few buckets, pirate swords and pistols, two of the new sword scabbards, and two rowboats, which are black.<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-whitecap-bay.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/POTC/neatstuff.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>A great hoard of piratey goodness for Lego fans.<br><br>All in all, Lego Whitecap Bay is a phenomenal addition to the Lego Pirates of the Caribbean line up with some well designed figures and display worthy buildings.

"David1971","2011-12-29T16:37:01.39Z","Splendid ... lovely set ... with mermaids!","<p>This is a great set. Our son is now nearly four, and so for the first time we built a standard (minifig-scale) LEGO set together. There's quite a lot of it, so it took a few sessions over a couple of days, but we really enjoyed it.</p><p>There are other good, detailed reviews on this site already, so I won't aim to cover everything.</p><p>This is a very good building, or set of buildings and other stuff, with many fun features. The main tower looks very big, solid and striking. The fact that it 'explodes' doesn't spoil things because it's been well designed to stand firm and tall *until* you play with the 'exploding' function, which works pretty well. My son certainly enjoyed it. And the (working) lighthouse light is excellent. There are lots of nice turrets and stuff for the pirates to clamber over whilst having adventures. The boats come with attractive lanterns. In fact, just all of it is very nice indeed.</p><p>The minifigs are great, very nicely designed with fine features, and the mermaids are extremely lovely. LEGO mermaids! They have to be among the best minifigs ever.</p><p>You don't need to have seen the <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> movies to like this set -- I only saw the first one, in fact, and this set is based on a scene from the fourth. But that doesn't matter.</p><p>The whole thing is very, very nicely designed with lots of nice detail. You can tell they've taken a lot of trouble to make every part of it just right. For example, the stairs that go up to the front door of the lighthouse tower, one plate height each, with rocks below, a very subtle and realistic feature that helps to 'sell' the whole thing as an environment that the minifigs might occupy.</p><p>Obviously it's expensive but you can really feel the quality. An excellent set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

I let my kids build it. They have played with it (even the mermaids) for a week. The break-apart tower was a bit too hard for them (7, 5, and 4 year olds). I built that. They have loved playing with the minifigs. I just bought it for the price to add more bricks to my collection. However, the set is really cool and worth a buy. I'm just too cheap, never pay full price for anything.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
"Sebastian","2012-04-10T17:44:46.147Z","Fortified modular lighthouse","<p>This has to be one of my favourite sets&nbsp;within the last few years and&nbsp;to me, this is easily the best of the Pirates of the Carribbean line.&nbsp;The lighthouse is an impressive and aesthetic&nbsp;structure whilst still retaining that feeling of a traditional Lego set, unlike,&nbsp;say, the CC buildings.</p>
<p>I find&nbsp;the use of dark grey as the main colour innovative and for me&nbsp;that choice&nbsp;works very well.&nbsp;My set sits on a shelf next to 2010's King's Castle and in comparison&nbsp;I really prefer the darker grey for a castle-like building.</p>
<p>As with many Lego buildings, the backside is open and some maritime accessories like sextant and rum bottle and a neat sitting room&nbsp;create a cosy ambiance. The beacon is also a real highlight of the set.</p>
<p>The net cannon in the shack works well and this beautiful set is rounded off by some great minifigures and two black boats.</p>
<p>The only thing that is a bit annoying is that break-down feature as the tower tends to fall off when moving the set around.</p>
<p>Even though the set is rather expensive I think it is worth buying at RRP. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"mathew","2012-07-06T22:48:49.843Z","Reminds me of the Disney ride","Before the movies there was the ride. &nbsp;I'll admit that I'm not a fan of the Pirate of the Caribbean films. &nbsp;They are typical of the big budget, over-long, non-sensical messes that audiences have to endure nowadays. The ride on the other hand, and it's been years since I've been to Disney, is a marvel of atmosphere and pacing. &nbsp;I would only hope that next time I visit Disney with my children (I was only 7 or 8 at the time) that the original ride as I remember it is still intact and not lobotomized to match the movies. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Now, this set, like the ride, is loaded with atmosphere. &nbsp;It starts with the use of dark gray instead of ""bley"" for the majority of bricks giving the set a dusky, menacing feel. &nbsp;Both the collapsing tower and the net cannon function much like elements on an amusement ride. &nbsp;The net cannon for example is mounted on rails so that one can smash it through the gateway. &nbsp;The collapsing tower doesn't function quite as well. &nbsp;You have to jiggle a ledge on the front of the tower to make it collapse. &nbsp;This works ok but it's also too easy to knock the tower apart by just moving the spot light. &nbsp;The black rowboats are pretty cool. &nbsp;I was first bothered that they were not brown but they go well with the rest of the set. &nbsp;The minifigs are highly detailed to be expected. &nbsp;Oh yeah, the nets. &nbsp;I may use one of these to make a hammock for the crew on my Imperial Flagship.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, great set. &nbsp;My review is a bit biased because I only paid $40 for it on clearance. &nbsp;At retail pricing I would probably not be as enthused. &nbsp;I think it's worth $60-70 and one may want to pick it up before it's discontinued. &nbsp;There's a lot of great bricks included that you can use for making your own stuff as well.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"Fauch","2014-12-27T15:05:22.9Z","Nice tower","<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As seen on the picture, tons of grey and brown pieces. Interesting stuffs include two boats, two nets, a rope, a quite large number of diagonal pieces (though just 4 diagonal panels, I believe many castles have more), quite a nice number of large plates, more than I expected. also, I heard the big barrel could be interesting to some people, got a lot of them with the western theme in the late 90&#39;s, so it wasn&#39;t special to me.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are all good, though I&#39;m not overly impressed. The best one is Jack Sparrow (though he is very common, but I think this variant may be a little bit rare). The head piece has great details, a tricorn&nbsp;(which is bigger than regular ones and with a red strip around it) along with hairs. A black&nbsp; is a nice change. Mermaids are ok, but not among my favorites. they have nice printed tails, also nice double printed faces where one side is more human and the other more monster like.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Overall, this is an easy build, the only part that is quite peculiar is the top of the tower, since it just sits there without being secured by any stud. there is also a building technic which let me clueless at first, until I realized it was a way to build sturdier pillars with the help of technic pins (and axles, but I knew this technic already)</p>

<p>I built the tower last, and the model was actually looking rather small, until I made the top of the tower. The result is of decent size, and the tower is quite big.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is a nice looking model, with a tower that looks sturdy (but really isn&#39;t), the use of dark grey is great, makes it look a bit ancient. there is a decent amount of details inside, not a lot, but they couldn&#39;t really have put much more.</p>

<p>Playability seems really good, two boats, nets, 6 figures, including mermaids and a zombi which can serve as antagonists, the net launcher works well, the net deploys itself automatically, though it doesn&#39;t enter completely in the cannon. The barrel can fall. The tower can crumble (though it really doesn&#39;t explode at all, but it&#39;s still fun). A small complaint is that the projector is nice, but the light button is a bit hard to reach, also, it should be able to rotate.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>70 euros was an ok but not great price for this. Despite, the model being modular, the connector pins are put in a way that makes it difficult to connect this model together in many different ways, though the 2 extra technic pins can open a bit more possibilities. I think the model would score a 5 if the projector could rotate.</p>
