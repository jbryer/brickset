"CapnRex101","2011-04-24T18:21:45.407Z","4195 - Queen Anne's Revenge","<p>This is another brilliant set from the new Pirates of the Caribbean theme. At the time of writing it is the largest set yet released, and I can't see things getting much bigger, or better, than this. The figures are very nice but I see the main attraction of this set as the ship itself which is possibly the best Lego warship I have! The detail is amazing and the parts are also wonderful with some totally exclusive parts such as the flaming skeleton torso featured as part of the figurehead.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box looks amazing on the shelf, as with many of the new sets the box size has been reduced to save packaging. The box art shows us the Queen Anne's Revenge sailing through rough seas, presumably on its way to secure the Fountain of Youth for Blackbeard and his pirate crew. It displays all of the&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;in an action shot with Captain Jack Sparrow (with his hat in this set) climbing the rigging while his friends and enemies fight it out on the decks below. The terrifying Blackbeard is watching from the top deck as he steers the ship, perhaps about to enter the fray. The many torches on the ship burn brightly giving off dull grey smoke, as does the burning skeleton on the bow which forms a frightening bowsprit. A cannon is firing to demonstrate that feature and two more are ready to fire. As with all of the Pirates of the Caribbean sets the bottom right corner of the box tells us that there is a poster inside and beneath that it says 'The ship does not float' which hopefully ought to prevent any ruined sails when someone tries to float the ship and it capsizes!</p><p>Again, as in all of the Pirates of the Caribbean sets, the instructions are packed in a bag with the poster and collector card, which in this set features Blackbeard looking threatening and of course a code on the reverse. The poster has another battle happening on the ship, different from the one on the box art with the ship viewed from behind. I am starting to quite like these posters, it&nbsp;definitely gives you some good ideas about how to display the set, I think it would look good if you put the poster behind the model on your shelf or desk, if you could resist playing with it that is!</p><p>My instructions were perfect with no mistakes and I had no missing pieces. The bags are numbered as with all Pirates&nbsp;of the Caribbean sets that I know of and that means we get a lot of spare pieces, including two of the new Ninjago bones!</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are some great parts in this set, including several black skeleton torsos and nineteen skulls! We also get sixteen large Ninjago bones including two spares and five smaller bones which are very nice as well. The sails are of course fabric and the flag is made of soft plastic and both look really fantastic. My favourite part though is the translucent orange new skeleton torso which is simply brilliant, and is currently totally exclusive to this set!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;in this set are excellent including three which are totally exclusive, them being the quartermaster zombie, the cook and Angelica, who has a fantastic hair/hat piece.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, we get Captain Jack Sparrow, who is wearing his fabulous hat and has the same extremely detailed torso and legs as we have seen in set 4191, Captain's Cabin and set 4192, Fountain of Youth, with a jacket, belt and handkerchief all nicely printed. He also retains the same braiding on this hairpiece as seen on his alternative hairpiece with his bandanna. Of course like&nbsp;every&nbsp;Jack Sparrow minifigure he has a double sided face, with one side a happy face and the other scared. We also get two zombies, the&nbsp;black&nbsp;zombie and the tanned zombie who both appear in the Captains Cabin set, they have some nice detail such as tattoos and a ripped shirt on the tanned zombie. We also get the fantastic Blackbeard, who, as I said in my review of the Fountain of Youth set is an amazing Minifigure with extremely accurate detailing and a lovely beard and hat. His sword is also fantastic with a shiny gold hilt which looks very regal (stolen from some unfortunate privateer&nbsp;I imagine). The exclusive Angelica is a wonderful figure, which as I mentioned earlier has a wonderful hair and hat piece, the hair is dark brown and her hat, which is black and has a small buckle, includes a tiny tan feather, which we most recently saw in the Forestman from the first series of the Collectable Minifigures. Her torso is very&nbsp;nicely&nbsp;printed with a green jacket with gold spirals and what looks like a corset beneath that. Unfortunately she has no leg printing, they are plain black, but she does have back printing on her torso&nbsp;which&nbsp;simply continues the decoration on her jacket although much of it is obscured by her long hair. The quartermaster zombie is also a nice figure, with a lovely headpiece with creepy white eyes and several scares and tattoos which are also printed on the reverse of his head. His torso is grey with an open jacket and more tattoos on his chest, he also has a rope belt and a key hanging from his neck on a chain.</p><p>It is difficult to believe but&nbsp;probably&nbsp;my favourite Minifigure is the cook, surprising perhaps but when you actually get the figure, the detail is absolutely fantastic. He has printed on his brown legs a white apron with several kitchen utensils hanging from it (such as a knife and fork etc.) and some tassels which continue onto his torso. Speaking of which, his torso features a belt and a green jacket with gold studs on top of a white shirt which I think could be very useful for any sort of pirate or medieval/historical character. His face is quite plain with a fairly generic smile and brown eyebrows. His hat is lovely piece, which I have not seen in tan before, it has probably featured in some of the older Pirates sets however so may not be new. There are also two complete white skeletons, but they form part of the bodywork and are somewhat grim adornments for the ship.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was long but not at all repetitive, it took me between one and a half and two hours to complete at a fairly&nbsp;leisurely&nbsp;pace. The set was full of brilliant building techniques, particularly the huge lantern at the back which features an ingenious use of two black skeleton&nbsp;torsos!&nbsp;I also love how the bowsprit is constructed with the flaming skeleton well supported off the front of the ship using white battle droid arms to support that and many of the bones surrounding it. We also get a lot of black in this set, which is good, as it has great MOCing potential with some of these black pieces being exclusive to this set or at least very rare.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model looks absolutely fantastic when the build is complete, very intimidating! The sails which are a dark red colour are beautiful, with&nbsp;subtly&nbsp;printed crossed swords and a crown, which is accurate to the real ship! Of course Blackbeard (or Edward Teach) was a real pirate and the Queen Anne's Revenge was really his ship which only adds to the interest for me as I think this is the only set ever produced which is a Lego recreation of a real galleon! Also I like the addition of the top gallant sail on the central mast and the sideways facing sail at the back, which is often left out on Lego warships.</p><p>The playability for this set is never ending, we get all the figures we need for a battle and firing cannons, which there are only three of for four&nbsp;cannon ports (which are not printed as sticker haters out there would have hoped) on each side.&nbsp;I would have hoped for at least four cannons but it is always possible to add another if need be. The anchor can also be raised and lowered with a chain which is a nice little feature to have!</p><p>I also really like the wonderful captain's cabin at the rear of the ship. The railings which are covered in skulls are fabulous and the windows at the back (which are stickers depicting skeletons and flames) really add to the menacing look of the set.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I think that if you are to purchase only one set from the Pirates of the Caribbean line then make it this one, if you are worried about the hefty price tag (Â£102.99 or $119.99) then don't be. It is expensive, but I think a set of this quality warrants such a price tag. As you can probably tell I would&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;recommend this set to anyone. The only slight problem I have with it is the lack of a fourth cannon, but I don't think that warrants a lost point as it is an easy problem to rectify, therefore I must give it...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This set is my first POTC set and it was a very enjoyable build. I can't compare it&nbsp;to other LEGO ship models because this was my first for those too! The minifigs are great: Captain Jack Sparrow(w/hat), Angelica, Blackbeard, The Quartermaster, two Zombie Pirates, and the cook. LEGO did a wonderful job making Jack into a Minifig,&nbsp;he looks just like the real one&nbsp;! This set came with a ton of skulls, bones, and skeletons which really puts the emphasis of-""When you board the ship, you probably won't make it off alive.""</p>
<p>Starting with the stern(rear) you have a huge stained-glass window with-of course- skeletons on it. A railing wraps around the back that is built of 15 skulls. A very large lantern hangs on the back made out of black skeleton bodies. Moving into the captain's cabin we have a desk with a map, two potion-looking bottles, and a voodoo Jack(using the trophy piece from LEGO Minifigures). The upper-most deck houses the helm(stearing wheel) but is otherwise quite bare. The main deck has plenty of room for minifigs and can hold up to 8 cannons, the set only gives you 3 :( . The side rails are built of bones and there are portal covers for the cannons. On the starbord(right) side the anchor is held. Up front there isn't much except for the figure head of a flaming skeleton holding a spear and a chalace. The Queen Anne's Revenge has 3 masts. The stern mast holds one triangular sail, the main mast holds 3 trapizoid-like sails and Blackbeard's flag on top, and the forward mast holds 2 trapizoid-like sails with a triangular sail in front. The 4 largest sails all have a design of a crown with 2 crossed swords on them.</p>

His face is captured perfectly in Lego form, and his hairpiece can be used for a hippie! What more can you ask for? Angelica also captures Penelope Cruz's face perfectly. She also has a fighting/constipated look on her other face. Disney sure likes that look! (Skelly Jack, Gibbs, Dastan, etc.) Blackbeard, look at my description of him here,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/?ID=39851"">http://brickset.com/reviews/?ID=39851</a>. Next up is the chef. He's a nice looking, generic figure. He's probably a top notch figure with you pirates fans because of his hat. The Yeoman and Gunner zombies are common figures are common, but really cool. The Quartermaster zombie is a new figure. He's pretty cool.

ONE OF THE COOLEST POTC SETS EVER!!","<p>First I think this set is extremely cool and worth the money all the way.One of the factores about this set is that black beard and his ship were real and I belive this set stays acurate to the actuly ship. Okey, on to the review.</p><p>First the minifigures. Captian Jack Sparrow:In this set jack has tricorn hat which is a nicelydone mold that matchs up perfectly to jack with out his hat.He also has double sided printing of his jacket&nbsp;on his legs chest.He his a sword and jis commpass and a double sided head.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Angelica: This is Jacks former love and rivel.She is acurate to the moive and has a double sided head one side is quit looking and the other has a adventureus grin.Also a double sided chest which decipts a green gold trimed vest.Her hair piece has a hat kind of like Jack, it has a buckle ad a small feather.She has a a sword. The interistin thing is her hair matchs the hair on one of the mermaids&nbsp;and you could use&nbsp;that for her withouther hat.&nbsp;</p><p>The Gunner and the Yeoman: These are the same guys fom the captians cabin. Still there pretty cool, the gunner has a belt with pins and other mechincal stuff.Both have duble sided chest and are buff.The yeomn has a ripped shirt and some teeth in his shirt.&nbsp;The Quartermaster: He is kind of fat and has a small grey vest, multipul tatoos and a&nbsp;rope belt. Again, double sided head and chest with a small key on a string.&nbsp; The cook:Not interly sure why his hear but with a half zombiefied crew&nbsp;Black Beard&nbsp;must need a cook, non the less he&nbsp;is cool&nbsp;and features a tan tricorn a double sided chest and printed apron on his legs with a fork and other utinsals.He has a kindly face.</p><p>And finly Black Beard: probley my favorate figure next to the new Jack, the detill&nbsp;is amezing and he (like every body else)has double sided printingon his chest and legs.He has a buckeners hat that look nice and has some printing on tp that looks like metel straps,his beard is realy cool,if your wondering wat the grey yellow things are black beard used to lace his beard with fuse cord an would light it before battle so it would glow and smoke.He has a studed jacket with a belt acrose it. He has a big honkin' sword with a gold hilt and it looks real cool.</p><p>Onto the ship, I will start from the front of the QAR. The front has a cool flaming skeleton, the body is translouscent. It has bone detialing on the front and bone railings. The back of the ship&nbsp; is very well designed, it has a balkony with execly 15 skulls and a huge stained glass window with more bones on the side.A huge black lanrern made out of black skelton parts&nbsp;hangs in the back. The catains cabin&nbsp; is small but you can fit 3 figs in it, theres a table with a map bottols and a voodoo doll, the doll is one of the collictable minifig tropheys printed to look like jack.</p><p>The main deck is large and has a wheel that winds up the anchor, theres also a barrel that has two bottoles(rum!)on top, theres a new buckett and a box of cannon bricks. You are free to move the cannons in to any spot you want.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a set that is breming with detail, the mast are huge, the flag is tatterd, there's lanterns ever were and up by the cabin theres two spots for muskets and/or swords.</p><p>I think this is a huge set worth the money,(and black beard!)worth the detail,(and black beard!)its a great adition to a POTC collaction. I cant think of any commplaints and if you can scrape togather the money then I would get this set. Now.The detail is awsome, I mean look, theres a rudder and all the sails are preasent and acounted for and the playablaty is endless.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So........I hope this looong review was helpful.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great looking and fun to build.&nbsp; Georgeous finished model.</li><li>Has really all the key MiniFigs you would want with this kit.</li><li>nice added features like the winch for the anchor, bucket, mounted rifles, lot's of cool, evil little details with the bones and sculls..</li><li>â¦</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>while the stern structure is impressive, I actually liked Lego's execution of the Black Pearls stern better.&nbsp; Queen Anne's Revenge is definitely impressive to look at, but from a design and ""functionality"" if you will, I like the Black Pearl with the steps, and the door to the captain's quarter better.&nbsp; this one is just a wide open quarter with no chair for Black Beard (although you could add one easy with spare legos)&nbsp; really could use the staircases and a door like the Black Pearl though.&nbsp; also the stain'ed glass window is built like it should be able to swing open, but once the kit is built, you cannot open it.&nbsp; seems silly to give it that swinging ability but then lock it in with the railings.</li><li>Why can't we get a cannon for each portal (you get 3, can manage up to 8)&nbsp; I mean, we spent $120.00 on the kit, you can't throw in 5 more cannons?</li><li>Front mast is a bit unstable, likes to come apart pretty easily.&nbsp; would have liked to have seen the rope ladders that stabalize the main mast on the front mast too.</li><li>â¦</li></ul>

Angelica is also a very good minifigure and has an accurate representation of the movie. She also has a nice hat/hairpeice and is unique to this set. The quartermaster is also unique.

The cook is unique&nbsp;has cleaning utensils, a green vest&nbsp;and a tricorne. The yeoman zombie is OK and helps fill up the ship. The gunner zombie has pretty cool printing. </p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are lots of bones and a really cool translucent orange skeleton chest. The rest of the parts are pretty standard except for the masts and hull pieces.&nbsp;There are only three cannons even though there is room for 8.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build is pretty standard for a ship. There are some repetitive bits such as when you are building the masts but it is not too bad. It is not very difficult althogh there are some stickers on it.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This has to be one of the best looking ships Lego have made. The masts look realistic and very striking. The hull looks great and all the fire details and bone details make it stand out. The ship looks great from the front and is a great display piece. The only thing it needs is more cannons to make it look better and not half empty.</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>The playability is really good. There are enough minifigures to stage the mutiny and enough deck space and rigging to have battles there. The captains cabin is not so good as it is small and hard to access. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A good sized box shows off an &lsquo;action shot&rsquo; of the ship sailing the high seas, although it does feature a disclaimer stating that, should you try it in real life, the ship will sink like a massive plastic stone (or words to that effect...). The build is split across two instruction books which are clear and easy to follow, though I did have some problems with the blacks looking dark grey on first glance, necessitating constant reference to actual dark grey pieces elsewhere on the page. There is also a free poster for those who like that kind of thing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>With over 1000 parts there is plenty of variety of shape and size in the box, ranging from the large familiar &lsquo;ships hull&rsquo; sections, rigging and mast pieces, down to a multitude of small fiddly 1x1 clip plates and bones. Not having examined pictures of the model in detail (and being more used to sets from the 1980s/early 1990s) I was surprised to see so many Technic pieces in a system set, but all became clear during the build&hellip;</p>

<p>Interesting parts include a &lsquo;flaming&rsquo; skeleton torso in trans orange, a couple of upside-down arch pieces and some large grey wedge plates. The crimson printed sails look stunning and are a welcome change from the usual stripe and/or skull patterns featured on previous ships, though it&rsquo;s a shame that they&rsquo;re only printed on one side.</p>

<p>On the downside, there are a few stickers for the &lsquo;canon covers&rsquo; (there must be a proper name for those?) and for the windows in the stern. Also, as others have noted, there is a distinct lack of canons &ndash; with eight portholes available, to only have three in the set seems a bit cheap on a large flagship set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Now I must admit that, while I don&rsquo;t have a huge interest in Minifigs, that they play a part in most people&rsquo;s appreciation of licensed sets, so if I get anything wrong I apologise now! There are seven characters included &ndash; Blackbeard, Jack Sparrow, Angelica, Cook, Quartermaster, and two pirates. The zombification (probably not a word) of the latter two certainly gives them a rougher and more threatening look than the classic pirates of old, with frighteningly detailed bare chest printing a particular feature.</p>

<p>The others also share the rich and detailed printing, (though thankfully not the bare chests) and Blackbeard sports his infamous bushy beard as a separate piece, complete with historically accurate lit fuses burning away madly at the sides. It&rsquo;s a good collection, with three unique figures, though for the price, we could really have done with a few more crew to make the ship look a little more populous.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Following the minifigs, the first steps are, disconcertingly, to build a small table, which then gets put to one side until you start to build the Captain&rsquo;s cabin some five bags and 70 pages later! Before that, the build is focused around the hull, with construction of eight canon posts and bases for the three masts. A decorative balustrade of bones &lsquo;hints&rsquo; at an ongoing design theme, which then gets sledge-hammered home with a small sub-build of&nbsp;the flaming skeletal figurehead.</p>

<p>The stern section containing the Captain&rsquo;s cabin and poop deck is a sub-build all of its own, with some interesting techniques using clips tilting the windows of the cabin to align with the outward sloping line of the stern created by inverted slopes. The stickers on the windows look good when applied, though as they&rsquo;re on the clear plastic backing, they are prone to bubbles, fingerprints and other marks. Following an obligatory skeleton garnish, the whole assembly then bolts onto the rest of the ship via a clip, resting on tiles for easy removal and play. This works well, though the rail of grinning skulls that is then bolted around the outside looks a bit awkward as it doesn&rsquo;t really line up or connect with the cabin (as well as being the final nail in the coffin for any subtly in the design theme!). The large ships lamp at the stern is an interesting little build (and of course comes complete with the mandatory skeletons, though in smoky black this time), but the use of a single curved piece to attach it to the model results in quite a fragile connection.</p>

<p>Finally, all the Technic pieces finally come into play for the masts and other spars which are a slightly distracting mishmash of colours. There is a bit of necessary repetition in these steps, though the varying heights and setups in rigging means you can&rsquo;t switch off concentration entirely. Topped off by a natty new pirate flag, the mainsails are added, followed by a bowsprit and jib-like sail at the front to complete the ship. The connections on the jib seem a little workman-like &ndash; they do the job, but not in a particularly elegant way.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>At first glance, this is a large and impressive model. The sails look fantastic (from the correct angle) and the ship compares favourably with previous ships in size. There are a few oddities in the design which don&rsquo;t quite stack up on closer inspection, most notably that the Captain&rsquo;s cabin is less a cabin and more an alcove &ndash; small, cramped, and open to the elements from the front! Neither are there are any stairs to allow logical access up to the poop deck and the ship&rsquo;s wheel.</p>

<p>I do feel that the designer may have slightly over-egged the pudding with all the bones and skulls that adorn the ship, but they do add a bit of fun and spalshes of colours to what would otherwise be a very dark sombre looking model. With insufficient canons and crew, the interior seems little deserted, but there&rsquo;s plenty of room to set up some pitched battles, and the Captain&rsquo;s cabin can be removed to stage . . . erm. . . whatever it is that goes on in there.</p>

<p>As the sails only feature designs on one side, you are limited to displaying the set the &lsquo;right&rsquo; way around (especially with the rear sail), which is a shame, but it does at least&nbsp;look fantastic from the correct angle.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite a fair few gripes above, this is a stunning-looking model which looks great on display. It&rsquo;s imposing enough to more than hold it&rsquo;s own against past pirate ships and the faded burgundy sails really make it stand out from the rest of our Lego Pirate fleet. The build is lengthy enough without being dull, and the use of Technic for the spars works well, despite the jarring colours.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve marked it down on playability because I feel it&nbsp;lacks the sheer class and fun of the Black Seas Barracuda, and though the design appeals to a maybe slightly older demographic,&nbsp;anyone towards the upper end of the age ranges specified on the box will not be particularly challenged by the build. There are some frustrating minor design flaws (especially around the Captain&rsquo;s cabin area) which mark it down a few notches from perfect, but this is still a worthy and visually striking addition to the fleet.</p>

"tvih","2012-07-04T08:35:32.817Z","Great ship - but not perfect","<p>My first pirate ship is a beautiful sight to behold - though it does have a few warts, too.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Huge box as usual. Given they made it that big, I can't figure out why they didn't put the poster into a cardboard tube instead of folding it. Folding paper posters makes them next to pointless, because the folding lines are all too evident.</p><p>Two instruction booklets are included. Clear and precise, as usual. If anything, often I thought they had too few parts installed per step. But better safe than sorry, keeping young builders in mind.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Plenty of ""unusual"" parts included for those who might want parts for other project - though I'm unsure why anyone would prefer to use the parts of this for something else ;) The part list includes many technic bricks and such, though mostly it's repetition of the same parts. So while the set has over a thousand pieces, be prepared to use the same kind of parts over &nbsp;again over again. Especially those 1x1 round bricks...</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The included 7 actual minifigs (I'm not counting the skeletons) look good. I'm not a huge PotC fan and got this set for the ship, not the figs, but they're well-made regardless.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Building was straightforward enough. I mean let's face it, I haven't run into difficult builds so far, and it's unlikely I ever will unless they decide to release sets with very poor instructions.</p><p>One thing to note though is that the ship is a bit fragile, especially during construction, so don't be heavy-handed. Keep this in mind, and it's smooth sailing. The build does take a while even with ""only"" 1094 pieces, which was actually nice since it wasn't over too quickly.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The ship looks very good, as expected. I like the combination of colors, and the skeleton &amp; bone decorations. Lanterns - both the big at the rear, as well as the smaller ones - look nice.</p><p>But the ship isn't without its problems upon closer examination. The captain's quarters have barely any contents, and it doesn't even have a door or anything, which is a bit silly. There's no deck, so in the main hull area everything is at the bottom of the ship. This makes playing slightly difficult, since you have to reach over the railings while avoiding the sails to move things there. The rear of the ship looks good other than the said lack of entrance etc, but it's also a bit fragile. I bought the ship to display rather than play with, so it's not a big deal for me, but for kids playing with the ship one should expect to perform repairs every now and then.</p><p>Also a silly detail is that there are actually holes in the bottom of the ship. Now, this isn't mean to float or anything, but having actual uncovered holes seems strange. The cannons - which there are only three, unfortunately, given the ship can hold 8 - are not on wheels and easily movable to the other side like in Imperial Flagship for example, which while not a major thing is unfortunate.</p><p>One minor problem I also found to be the parts with rows of skulls at the rear sides of the ship. They're meant to movable to allow access to the windows I guess, but they actually stay a bit detached from the flooring between them and the window. So they stand out instead of feeling integrated to the ship. I'm unsure whether or not try working my way around that somehow.</p><p>One other thing is the masts. They don't look as good as I would've hoped perhaps, but I suppose they're not a major eye-sore. The sails look great, though. I really like the dark red. I would've wished for some additional ropes to go between the sails, but I suppose you could add some yourself.</p><p>I feel that the ship is at its best on display so that you don't see the interior, which for me is fine since that's how I keep it anyway. It would be possible to improve the ship - for display purposes at least - by building a deck yourself. For playability this wouldn't be such a good thing, since you would lose access to the cannons, and there wouldn't even be enough space for minifigs to stand under the deck. Compare to the larger Imperial Flagship, where you have the removable deck with plenty of space under it. But even with that ship, using cannons with the deck in place doesn't seem really possible (with the caveat that I unfortunately don't actually own that ship, so I could be wrong).</p><p>Furthermore you could probably build some sort of entrance to the rear of the ship, instead of leaving it open.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I find it to be a nice ship, but it certainly has its flaws. I still recommend it though, especially for display. And with some creative additions, you should be able to improve it further. Even with its flaws, it seemed the best option as far as ships at the moment. The only other ship available at retail, the Black Pearl, is a lot smaller and costs almost as much. Though it is probably better designed and not as fragile based on pictures. Then there's the Imperial Flagship, which I might've gotten instead had it still been available. At aftermarket prices, it would've cost over twice as much as the Queen Anne's Revenge.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
