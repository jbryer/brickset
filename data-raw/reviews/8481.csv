<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Denmark like Plastic 
<li>Overall apearance looks good and scary 
<li></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>No metal rods on his Neck 
<li></li></ul>

<p>This is a great minifigure to add to your collection and to a horror setting. if you find him buy it. -Thanks for Reading</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,5

As basic as you can get Lego wise, but still, he is such an iconic figure that you can't help but smile at the legend in plastic. Seriously, what better tribute to a character that is constructed of parts than to be made from the ultimate piece together toy. The band-aids on his head just make this figure that much better. Better than the Wolfman and less grotesque than the Zombie from series 1.<br />
<br />
My only nit pick is that the color is significantly lighter than the pictures.<br />
<br />
Worth getting due to shear iconic stature at least.</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-15T09:06:05.51Z","LEGO Collectable Minifigures (Series 4) - The Monster Review","This monster is a very cool minifig to have. This Frankenstein has some better details on the head than the one we got in set 1382 (Scary Laboratory) from the LEGO Studios theme back in 2002. I also like the details on his torso and this character is a great addition into any LEGO collection for sure.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,5
"AETerry","2011-05-13T13:49:40.853Z","The Monster Review","<p>With the exception of the Zombie from Series 1, getting this minifigure completes out the current ""Monster Sub-theme"" for the Collectible Minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm very thrilled to get such a fun character of a highly iconic monster. The print job for this mini's torso is good and the head piece with the bandage prints is good too. He can easilly fit in with the other monsters or right along side the Crazy Scientist Minifigure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I am to have a complaint at all about this minifigure, it's that the doesn't come with anything more in the way of an accessory. Even the werewolf mini was given a bone for the sake of something to hold and this mini lacks anything like that. I wouldn't count his unique head piece as so many other minifigures have got a unique head or hair piece along with an accessory. It's a great figure, I just can't help but feel LEGO could have come up with something... pitchfork? torch? Who knows.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,4,3
"clundsberg","2011-04-30T17:39:14.207Z","PUTTIN' ON THE RIIIIITZ!","<p>cudos if you got my title-joke.</p>
<p>Picked up 6 of these minifigures today (only 1 double of the soccer-player, but not bad...son really wants the artist, so he was bummed) and happened to get the combo of Monster and Mad Scientist! Instant friends and classic movie scene!</p>
<p>While this is an iconic figure and while there is an irony about having a Frankenstein-monster pieced together with&nbsp;Legos, the only outstanding attribute is the head-piece.&nbsp; Being lighter in colour than the images portray didn't bother me as much as the lack of accessories. If they had given him a longer torso (such as Toy Story Woody) to extend his monsterous girth that would have at least been something. Perhaps some big cluncky boots or an iconic torch (that maybe he's NOT afraid of) would also have worked.</p>
<p>As always, these are great to collect and I'm not poo-pooing this addition by any means.</p>
<p>Especially great if you were fortunate enough to find earlier sets and have the other monster figures. (I do not ;p)</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,5,3
"8BrickMario","2015-10-04T20:25:15.283Z","He only wanted love...and he got it from me!","<p>This is one of the standout figures from Series 4. Since I love monsters, I needed to get him.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The orange packaging of Series 4 looks nice, and doubles as a nice spooky color befitting three of the characters in the series.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Monster&#39;s parts are okay. They capture the look perfectly, although they&#39;re not very versatile.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is such a vast improvement over the Studios Monster! Based on the classic Boris Karloff portrayal of the Monster, he looks fantastic. He has a new headgear piece that extends his brow and gives him his signature flat head. The piece blends in rather well, and is necessary to the look. A silly touch is added to the piece, since adhesive bandages are being used to hold together his forehead. This makes him less menacing and has a cute charm to it. His torso is printed with a tattered coat and shirt, and lines of large laces holding together his chest and coat. His face has an appropriately monstrous look, with sunken eyes, cheekbones, and wrinkled lips and eyebrows. He has a very serious, almost sad expression. His legs have no printing, but they don&#39;t suffer from the lack of detail.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>He&#39;s a great minifigure. He&#39;s such a nice execution of the classic Monster, and definitely worth adding to one&#39;s collection.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-12-23T19:04:53.28Z","a GREAT figure!","<p>So the seventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is The Monster. This was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 5 pieces (the info bar for the figure says 4 pcs, but that&#39;s not counting the display stand,). So let&#39;s take a closer look at this dude!</p>

<p>On top we have what might be the most interesting part of the figure, which is of course the Monsters head piece. Now the top part of the head is a separate piece, and it just connects to that stud on the head like a typical LEGO minifigure, and while it does look a bit strange, with the edges jutting out, it still captures the character pretty well. I must say though, the Crazy Scientist from Series 14 had this same sort of setup, to where they added an extra part of the head, and it looked much more normal than this. I guess that&#39;s because that was when LEGO really got the hang of CMF&#39;s. Anyways, I like the band aid printing on it, and the black hair is printed not dual moulded. I can&#39;t help but wish they would&#39;ve added printing to the eyebrows, because that just would&#39;ve made the figure more detailed. But oh well I guess. Also, that piece was new for the figure. It&#39;s always great when LEGO gives us new pieces for CMF&#39;s. Course, since around 2012 that&rsquo;s became pretty normal, but back in 2011 it was a tiny bit rare.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which has a really nice expression; he looks pretty unhappy right now! I just love the cheekbones on his face, and the angry frown looks great. Unfortunately, he has no alternate expression, but I can&#39;t really complain because since the rest of the figure is so great, I don&#39;t think he really needs one.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso which is again, really cool. I love that ripped jacket as well as the ripped undershirt, and the pale green skin underneath looks awesome as well. Unfortunately he has no back torso printing.</p>

<p>And his legs are nothing special, so let&#39;s move on to his accessory...he doesn&#39;t have an accessory either, so I guess we&#39;re already on to the final verdict. And my overall opinion is that I love this figure. When I went in to this review I gave him a 4, but the more I look at him, the more I think he deserves a 5. I&#39;m super satisfied with this figure. And when you compare him to every other &quot;The Monster&quot; figure, I think this one might be my favorite. I mean the one from LEGO Studios looks pretty awful; the one from Monster Fighters is a really nice figure, with the exclusive coloring for the piece, but it just isn&#39;t as iconic as this one; the one from the Monster Fighters Castle set has the same situation; and even though the Monster Rocker from Series 14 is pretty fantastic, it might not be as good as this dude. All in all, I&#39;m just super happy with the way this came out, and that&#39;s basically it for this review!
