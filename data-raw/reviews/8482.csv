"Nesquik","2011-04-08T06:43:01.537Z","Full Steam Ahead!","Although one of the more 'blander' outings for Series 4, I feel the Sailor is perhaps the jolliest minifigure this time round.

"AETerry","2011-06-15T15:15:06.44Z","Sailor Review","<p>Weirdly enough, when I saw that the lone Series 4 minifigure pack on the shelf aisle... I ended up managing to complete an entire Series for the Collectible Minifigures. I'm not sure yet if I'll keep him in the long run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a fun little figure like so many of the others have been. With the print job for the torso and the hat, you can clearly see this is what it is. The detail is just the right ammount is great. The hat is fun, sitting sideways on the minifigure's head. Add then that he's holding a silver or metal periscope for an accessory piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all... whether you're collecting him for a complete set or a MOC idea in mind, this is a fun little figure to have around and I do enjoy looking at him. I didn't rank it high for parts or building as this is just a minifigure, so there isn't much of a challenge and what you do assemble is fairly straightforward.</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,4

<p>A very nice mini considering the thought put into the facial expression (winking) with the accessory (telescope).&nbsp; His appearance doubles from that of a friendly sailor (come on, all your Lego ladies will swoon at a man in uniform winking at them) to&nbsp;the realistic appearance&nbsp;a man on the lookout for other ships or land (or maybe more Lego ladies) by putting the telescope to his open eye.</p>
<p>Another great perk? You are one more step closer to completing you Lego Village People Set - although good luck spelling out Y-M-C-A!</p>
<p>Seriously, I've always thought it would be nice to see Lego sets that honour military.&nbsp; I would still like to see some WWII planes, however the sailor is a great start and basic enough to encompass the look of many of this world's Navy uniforms.</p>
<p>This is one of the few in this set where duplicates work to building up a team of the same (see Hazmat comment)</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3
"Snowtrooper119","2011-11-08T18:54:00.947Z","Review of sailor","This is quite a good minifigure. There is not too much detail but the detail that is there is very good. His face is winking as he maybe looking through the telescope or winking at someone and he has a cool hat that is sloping off to one side. The telescope is quite cool as well. The only problem is there is no leg printing but there probably isn't much they could have done anyway. I quite like this minifigure and I think he is a worthy addition to the collectible minifigure line.",FALSE,4,4,1,4,4
"tkettle9719","2011-12-28T18:14:39.16Z","Argh, Captain!","This sailor is one of the simplest, yet nice minifigures in my collection. This figure is not my best, though it is not my very worst. <br>

<p>This is a nice minifigure from Series 4, even if it isn't the best. I think that the spyglass is among the most awesome pieces in the theme as a whole.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2016-11-15T01:27:07.453Z","I Yam what I Yam","<p><strong>Set #8804 Sailor: </strong>This particular character from Series 4 looks very nice. And makes for a decent swabbie for the Sea Captain to be commanding. Now if he could just stop squinting so much.</p>

<p>The Sailor minifigure features very limited printing, the front of the torso has his neck tie thing, I am unsure what it is officially called but I feel cravat might be appropriate, even if it is just French for tie. You can see some blue striping at the neck line and the print carries over onto the back of the torso for the back of the cravat. He&#39;s using a brand new hat piece for a seaman, and the facial expression with the squinty eye goes well with his silver spyglass accessory piece.</p>

<p>Overall this is a fairly decent offering from the Series and uses some great parts. The printing is minimal, but catches the look of a Sailor quite nicely. I&#39;d recommend this one too if you don&#39;t already own one, or two, or even three. Just swap the head with other Minifigs to MOC up a small army for the old Sea Captain to command.</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2012-03-31T08:38:36.067Z","Find him on sail.","<div>Since LEGO never has had nor never will it have a navy-themed set, we are forced to conclude that this poor Sailor has been cast adrift from some alternate universe and somehow found his way here. And since the Village People reference has already been used, I am now left with the very difficult role of deciding what role the Sailor will play in LEGO City.</div><div><br></div><div>Sailor is a simple and no-frills Minifig with a clean design that clearly shows who he is and what he does (or what he did, anyway). I believe his hat is a new piece, and it feels sturdy and looks good. Not unexpectedly, Sailor has a special head which is pretty expressive and yet generic enough that it can be swapped out with, say, a regular city citizen who you would perhaps like to wink flirtatiously at the bank clerk. Sailor’s only accessory is a useful telescope piece that I feel that I see being used more often as a part of a railing or table more than anything else, but whatever - it’s the kind of piece that’s easily cannabilised as part of a larger design and is therefore valuable for that reason.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If I buy Collectible Minifigs from a regular brick-and-mortar store, I usually don’t bother to “feel” for Minifigs that I might want, just to get the thrill of opening something at random (don’t judge me). Needless to say, I had the unfortunate experience of getting two Sailors from three packets that I bought at once, and I have sort of been at a loss to decide what to do with them other than recreate scenes from <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchors_Aweigh_(film)"">Anchors Aweigh</a></i>. I imagine that he (they) would feel much more at home in a city that had a coastal/beachfront display, as necessitated by having Marina (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=4644-1"">4644</a>) or something similar on display, which I unfortunately do not have.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, Sailor is a unique and well-designed Minifig, although I find him to be slightly on the boring side. I can’t deny, though, that he adds flavour to any town, which I suppose is a good enough criterion as any for a Collectible Minifig.</div>",TRUE,3,4,1,4,1
"sideswinger","2021-03-30T18:59:50.997Z","GREAT figure, bad price!","<p>The tenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Sailor. This figure retailed for three&nbsp;dollars, was released in 2011, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that sailor&#39;s hat piece.I believe the piece itself was new and exclusive to the figure, and that awesome anchor printing makes it exclusive even to this day. I think that&#39;s a fantastic piece, and I do really love it as a whole.</p>

<p>Next we have his face print, which I love it for what it is: just a plain, generic face. Nowadays in a CMF, that would be a bit sad, but in 2011,we sort of needed more plain face prints. This one is great, and is better than most face prints in the series.You can&#39;t see it due to that telescope, but his left (or right, depending on how you look at it) has a winking design. That&#39;s supposed to replicate im squinting to see through the telescope, but it works better for a winking design, if you ask me. we don&#39;t tactually get a lot of winking faces either, especially with male figures, so this one is extremely useful, with its generic design. It was pretty sweet for 2011 too, as winking expressions were even rarer back then. He has no alternate head print, which is great because that hat wouldn&#39;t cover it, so it&#39;d look awful.And that front face is so cool, we don&#39;t really need an alternate print.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, which is just as cool as the head and hat. I am just in love with that typical sailor outfit, and it isn&#39;t too complex, which is perfect, in my opinion. It isn&#39;t overdone, and that&#39;s just what it needed. The dark blue does look good, and I&#39;ve heard o it beng used in a Marshmallow Man figure from Ghostbusters. What I find pretty darn incredible, is that he has back torso printing. That is just so generous of LEGO, mostly because this was 2011. All in all, it&#39;s a great torso design.</p>

<p>His legs have no printing, and they are just plain white. That is A-okay if you ask me, because it doesn&#39;t really need printing. His accessory is just that silver telescope piece, which looks awesome in that colour. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s exclusive,&nbsp;but it still looks epic.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure! Overall, I really do love the overall design of this guy, and It really works for what they were going for. I actually think this&nbsp;is my favourite LEGO Minifigure boat-themed figure ever and it&#39;s just so simple, that it&#39;s hard not to love.&nbsp;However, with that being said, I think it might be a bit too simple for three&nbsp;dollars, which is why I rated&nbsp;the value for money at a 2. But still, I really love this figure, and it&#39;s one of my favourites of the series. As always, check out my profile, as well as my other reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
