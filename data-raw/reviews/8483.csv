Unlike many others, this Musketeer would normally have trouble fitting into any existing Lego Theme, so he makes a nice addition to surely any collection for his originality.<div><br></div><div>The pieces are pretty much accurate to the promo-images except for his weapon, which is actually a matte-grey plastic and not the 'shiny silver' as seen on many pictures. The product comes with plenty of other nice features, such as the 'quiff' in his hat and a nice confident face. Of course, as the previous reviewer suggested, it would perfect to have three of these guys side-by-side, but the only way to give each a distinct personality would be to change their heads.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Great addition to Series 4!</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"castlestrike666","2011-04-27T11:35:43.943Z","Buy them now","<p>Definitely one of the best minifigures&nbsp;on the market&nbsp;now. All of his parts can be used in multiple themes and for many kinds of purposes. The hat, sword and torso are the items making this figure worth buying.</p>
<p>Try getting as much as you can now, because same as the Spartan and Elf, purchasing a Musketeer will be a small investment within a few months/years.</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,4,5
"AETerry","2011-06-01T14:51:42.953Z","Musketeer Review","<p>This minifigure is an obvious&nbsp;choice for getting at least three to do a 3 Musketeers scene with them.&nbsp;Four if you want to be able to have Athos, Porthos, Aramis and d'Artagnan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coloring choice and print job do a great job to convey a Musketeer minifigure, even for the face with a thin mustache and goatee. After that, then come in accessories and head piece to complete out the figure. The hat is the same used in the Pirates of the Caribean sets for Barbossa. The rapier though, I do like that, a different styling of sword then what LEGO has done before for their minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A rather fun little figure to have and look at. If I can get a hold of a couple more, I'll be happy, otherwise I may look into trading them off.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,4

"kaptainkool","2011-07-20T18:19:32.79Z","my favorite of the series","<p>First off the hat is from Barbossa from pirates of the caribbean, but this figure was made before POTC lego came out, so it would be considered a new hat. The feather would look cooler possibly to you if it was turned so it's facing the back of the hat, or you could turn it straight out. I mostly liked the sword but it is pale silver but you would never expect them to make a pure silver sword. If you feel like it, you could get three of them and switch the heads but I didn't do that cuz I didn't have enough heads with moustaches.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>fleur de lis logo on torso covered by strap 
<li>pads on knees instead of plain black</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>they could have used cape material for blue part 
<li>not really a con, but there was flaw around his eye for mine</li></ul>
<p>Hopefully you can get one of these before they take them away and series 5 comes out. I kind of have OCD, so I got a little bothered by the flaw of printing at the edge of his eye. Maybe it won't bother you. These are one of the best. If I were you, I would go to the nearest toy store right now and get one.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

"sideswinger","2020-11-09T20:04:43.443Z","Good figure, bad colors.","<p>So the third minifigure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Musketeer. He includes 7 pieces if you count the display stand, was released in 2011, and retailed for three dollars. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting off the figure, we have that hat piece, which was new for the figure if I&#39;m not mistaken. I do really love that piece, with the wide-brimmed black color, and there&#39;s even a bit of moulding on the front. There&#39;s also a little hole on the top, where you can plug in the white feather piece.</p>

<p>And while the hat might be my favorite part of the figure, the face print looks neat as well. I like that confident smile, as well as the pointy beard, and the mustache looks great as well. Unfortunately no back facial expression, but that&#39;s alright, since it&#39;d probably peek through the bottom of the hat.</p>

<p>The next piece is his torso, and the printing there is pretty cool, if you ask me. I love that big brown strap, as well as the big logo on his shirt, and I think LEGO made a really nice choice in coloring the arms white, as I think that makes for a very nice color scheme. No back printing, which is a bit unfortunate, but it is to be expected; back printing was pretty rare back then.</p>

<p>Finishing off the structure of the figure, we have his legs, which are done in plain black. He does have some orange printing on the front of his legs. I like how LEGO went above and beyond to do that, but it does cause some issues for me. First off, the orange there really does not mesh well with the rest of the figure, and all those different colors just don&#39;t work well together. I mean look at all the colors on this dude! We got black, yellow, white, blue, brown, black, orange, and gray, and if you ask me they come together for a really odd color scheme. But I guess it is what it is.</p>

<p>And finally, we have his accessory. I might be wrong about this, but I think that sword piece was also new for the figure, which is great. I do think it&#39;s a nice part too, with the moulding around the tip and all. The piece has actually been used a heck of a lot since then across various themes, which is sort of interesting. Overall, it&#39;s just a neat piece.</p>

<p>And my overall opinion of this dude, is that he&#39;s okay. Again, the colors don&#39;t work for me, but I think the torso, hat, and sword are enough to make this a pretty decent figure. And for three bucks, I think that&#39;s an alright value. Two bucks would&#39;ve worked better, but three isn&#39;t all too terrible. He&#39;s actually a sort of pricey figure on Ebay, ranging from about eight to twenty bucks. Eight is pushing it, but twenty dollars? No thank you.</p>

<p>Either way, that&#39;s all for this review! Don&#39;t forget to follow me LEGO Ideas (Username: sideswinger) and don&#39;t forget to follow me on Roblox (username s1deswinger,) and thanks for reading!</p>
