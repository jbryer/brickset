"bald_flieger","2011-03-30T08:03:44.347Z","skater","In my opinion its a real good figure, his outfit is nice. He weares the same cap as the skier, but on the front is printed a brick. His torso is printed on the front and rear side, it looks like he is wearing a t-shirt under a jacket with a hood. The legs are just sand colored. His face has also a good expression.<br>The board is a bit to big compared to the figure, probably it`s hard to make a smaller one, on which a figure could stand. The board has also printings on the top side, which is not realistic, boards are printed just on the bottom side.<br>After all, it`s a nice skater.<br><br>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,4
"AETerry","2011-05-14T11:44:07.177Z","Street Skater Review","<p>My first thought on seeing this character is to compare him to the Series 1 Skater. I'd want to complain about this concept of a minifigure already having been done and that it's too soon to do another design concept of one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure that the Skater being redone is an apology to parents with Series 1 where it was such a limited run and not very many people who wanted the minifigures got them. There's a post review over on Amazon where a parent complains about the high price and only wanting the Skater for their kid, but wasn't willing to pay an inflated price. Hence why I believe with Series 4, we're seeing another Skater, to allow more of the target audience of children an opportunity to get a hold of this figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time around the Skater's skateboard is black with a print design on it vs. Series 1 skateboard that's just a solid blue. He's wearing a beanie cap with a green brick print on it, glasses this time on the head and to finish him off his torso has a cool print that looks like a hood jacket partially zipped up showing he's wearing a shirt underneath. In many ways I think the detail work is far better then that of the Series 1 Skater and hopefully this time around, many more kids who want one of these guys will be able to get them.</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,5,5

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Mini-Fig has some great parts, he has a double-sided torso print of a black tee-shirt with a hoodie over-top of it, stuff found on your typical skaters. It has a nice orange zipper and hood strings on the print making it really pop next to other Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The facial design is also impressive, with a nice white toothed smile and a pair of glasses over his eyes, you don't see too many Mini-Figures with glasses on. I can recall only two I've ever owned, Studios Spider-Man's Peter Parker and this guy. The skateboard included with the figure is the same basic piece from Series (I want to say 2's) skateboarder. One end has a skyline printed image while the other has a basic LEGO brick with wings behind it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new touque he's wearing is also a very nifty piece, I'd say he's probably representative of a Mini-Fig out skating during Fall. Overall I'd say this Mini-Fig is really a worthy addition to any LEGO City/Town MOCs/Displays and a great addition to your MIni-Fig collection.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3

"Harmonious_Building","2011-12-11T08:56:15.833Z","Rebel with a cause.","Let me tell you something about Street Skater. A lot of people despise this person for several reasons: that he is essentially a reboot of the earlier Skater (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=8683-6"">8683-6</a>), that he further represents LEGO's strange fetish for board sports amongst its Collectible Minifigs, that he represents nothing otherworldly or fantastic and is therefore boring.<div><br></div><div>Let me tell you that all of this is wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>Look around you. Take a good look around you and tell me if this is not what you see: that LEGO City is a Nordic monoculture, a city that builds more marinas than schools, where society forces you to either be a policeman or a construction worker, where any man with a gold tooth and a slightly menacing appearance must be a criminal and is therefore imprisoned without a trial. Look at the cost and size of police stations compared to other essential city services; look and see that the average citizen is being monitored 24 hours a day. Behind these colourful bricks and smiling people hides a generation of citizens living in fear.</div><div><br></div><div>The Street Skater is not one of those people. On his cap bears the insignia of a melting or bleeding LEGO brick - symbolic of the urban decay that continues to plague LEGO City. On his board is printed a dramatic representation of a shining city on a hill, a glorious monument to the ideals that men and women once held so sacred. And in the face of all of this, he smiles.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Street Skater will indeed stand on the City Corner (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7641-1"">7641</a>), but it won't be on a soapbox. Street Skater will say nothing. Staid businessmen will walk around him; parents will tell their children not to grow up like him. All the same, at the back of their minds, they will all look at him and think: there was a time when all of us wanted to be as free as he was. And it is this silent rebellion that will raise Street Skater to the podium where he is supposed to be: an icon of LEGO counterculture, a starting point for a revolution.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This, dear friend, is why Street Skater is the greatest Collectible Minifig that has ever existed or will ever exist. So don't be a hater. Be a learner.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,3
"kaptainkool","2011-07-21T20:04:43.333Z","best of the skater dudes from series 1","<p>This minifigure is an improvement of the skaterdude from series 1. The Skateboard has a unique design which is a white brick with wings and light blue outlining, and on the other side is a row of buildings and same color. the beanie is dark gray and a picture of a brick dripping goop with light green outlining. You could probably use the head to make Clark Kent, and the sweater piece you can make a custom figure with it. The pants are the same color as lego Henry Jones Senior.</p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-15T09:10:16.953Z","LEGO Collectable Minifigures (Series 4) - Street Skater Review","This figure has been my first minifig of series 4. The street skater is a cool character to have and I love the markings on the skateboard and the torso. The hat has a cool printing of a LEGO brick on the hat as well. I really can't complain much about this figure - even if LEGO already did a skater back in series 1.<br><br>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,5
"sideswinger","2021-03-30T18:05:25.23Z","a ""MEH"" figure!","<p>The ninth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Street Skater, and this is one of the few figures that has a score of 3 on all the ratings. Why? Keep reading to find out. This figure retailed for three dollars, includes 8 pieces, and was released in 2011. Now let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hat print, which is exclusive to the figure. The piece was new for the series, as was the colouring of the piece, and that green brick printing is exclusive to the part as well. I do really like that piece, and it really looks good on him.</p>

<p>Next we have his face which, despite it looking similar to others, is exclusive to the figure, of course. I love the chipper smile, and the glasses look good on him too. He has no alternate expression, which is okay.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, and l<b>&nbsp;</b>love how that came out. I just really do love the orange symbol under that slick grey jacket, and the orange all around it looks swell. He actually does have some back printing as well, which is incredible, if you ask me. All in all, a fantastic torso.</p>

<p>The legs have no printing, so let&#39;s move on to his accessory, which is that skate bard, comprised of three pieces. The printing on that black base looks awesome, and is one of my favourite skateboard prints out there. Those white wheels look equally appealing, and that&#39;s just a very&nbsp;well-done skateboard design.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it! All in all, I don&#39;t really know how I feel about this figure. I mean sure, the printing all around is great for 2 dollars, but the figure itself isn&#39;t that exciting, simply because of how common that type of figure is. I mean this is already a remake of the Series 1 Skater Guy, which stinks already; but there&#39;s lots and lots of LEGO City characters who look pretty darn similar to this. And the choice of having a skateboard guy is already a little boring, so it&#39;s no surprise&nbsp; the finished product isn&#39;t overly amazing either. But on the bright side, his printing is pretty sweet, which is why he gets an overall score of three. Either way, check out my profile, as well as my other CMF reviews, and as always, thanks for reading!</p>
