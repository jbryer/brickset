"C_lego","2011-04-01T12:09:01.967Z","Series 4 Viking","<p>The Viking is a very well desinged minifigure. It definitly isn't your ""King"" of the vikings but is a great common warrior to add to all the others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>~ It has a very cool new shield element 
<li>~ New torso and leg elements 
<li>~ Goes well with the all ready existing Vikings made in 2005 and 2006</li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>~ none </li></ul>

<p>This is a good minifigure to add to either your Vikings sets or to just build up your minifigure collection.</p>

"davy_jones","2011-06-10T10:36:01.587Z","Scandinavian star","<p>With the release of the recent Thor movie, this minifig's timing is perfect. It captures the essence of the whole Norse/Viking concept very well. The minifig's face has excellent detailing and expression. Color scheme deserves praise.</p>
<h4>The Good</h4><p>1. Helmet with horns is a cliche we all want in a viking and Lego delivers well.</p><p>2. Shield and axe are accesories that complement each other. Shield's design is a notable effort.</p>
<h4>The Bad</h4><p>1. One very small gripe, just wish the legs had a bit more detailing, maybe furry boots.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Get this&nbsp;little Scandinavian icon&nbsp;folks.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"AETerry","2011-06-07T19:01:10.463Z","Viking Review","<p>All in all, I'd say this is a pretty good figure with good detailing. The print job for the legs, showing leggings and the torso with chainmail under a leather vest are very on par with the expect quality of the Collectible Minifigures. The face is good too with the beard, sneer and a scar over an eye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the accessories, you've got a silver viking style helm with pearl gold horns on it, his hand axe is in two parts for the haft and then the metalic grey axe head and finishing out the figure is his round shield with what looks to me to be celtic knotwork &amp; designs on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've only got the one figure and he makes for a great display piece and setting around with my other minifigures. It's not a figure I was expecting to get a hold of, but he is a very decent one for those looking to add one to their collections.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4

"The_Reviewer","2011-04-29T23:36:28.517Z","Viking Review","I first thought this minifigure was kinda boring,but now I think this viking is better than the vikings from the Vikings theme(2005-2006).He has a small ax, a sheild with a dragon-like design,and a helmet(you have to put the horns on the helmet).The face is very well printed; I like the sneer and the beard.The legs have lacings and the chest has armor printed.Overall this is a good minifigure to your collection and a great follow up to the vikings theme.Find him if you can.-Thanks for reading.",FALSE,5,3,1,5,5

The torso has some detailing that makes you think he has just come off the longboat after a harsh time at sea! What a previous brickset-reviewer pointed out was that the legs should have had some more kind of furry boot-printing. I agree to that (perhaps furry boots).

"sideswinger","2020-12-22T21:41:30.49Z","GOOD figure or a BAD one?","<p>So the sixth minifigure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Viking. This figure retailed for three dollars, he was released back in 2011, and includes 10 pieces. And before I look at the actual figure, I just wanna say that I&#39;ve reviewed many sets on Brickset, and this is the only one ever to get three stars in all 5 categories. Is that a bad thing? Let&#39;s find out!</p>

<p>Starting him off we have that three-piece helmet which is made from, of course, three pieces: the base, and the two pearl gold horns. I&#39;m not sure whether the helmet was new for the figure or not, but either way, it&#39;s a great attribute to the figure. I love the coloring for those horns, and I like how they just stick out of the sides of the helmet.</p>

<p>Next we have his face, which has a cool print. I love the angry expression, as well as the dark orange beard. I don&#39;t think this face looks too historical, so I could see it being used outside the setting. And he has no alternate expression, which is common for older CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Next up is his torso, and I do like how it came out. To me, it doesn&#39;t look super unique, but it is technically an exclusive print, so I can&#39;t really complain. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it does look good. I like the brown ripped jacket on the sides, and the chain mail design looks great as well. I just don&#39;t really think it&#39;s the most amazing design. Another thing that&#39;s actually good about the torso, though, is that his arms are plain yellow, which is pretty cool, if you ask me. No back torso printing, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Next up is his legs, which have a tiny bit of printing on them. I like the brown fur design on the fronts. But the problem is, the brown fur doesn&#39;t carry on to the sides because LEGO was too lazy to print the sides of his legs. I get that it was a little tough for LEGO to print the sides of minifigures, but this cost $3 dollars. They could&#39;ve toughened up, and printed the sides, and it would&#39;ve made the figure better for me. But they chose not to print the sides, and it kind of makes the figure suffer. But oh well, I guess.</p>

<p>And finally, we have his accessories, and his two accessories are okay I guess. He has an axe, which is made up of two pieces, and a shield. I think the shield has some cool printing on it, with all those different symbols, and I like how they gave him two accessories. That shield is an exclusive print as well, which is pretty cool.</p>

<p>And as I said earlier, this is the only thing I&#39;ve ever reviewed o Brickset to have three stars in all 5 categories. I do think it deserves that, as it&#39;s half cool and half not-so-cool. I mean the cool part is that he does have a nice design, with the torso, face, helmet, and shield, but the bad part is that he lacks side leg printing, and it just doesn&#39;t feel super unique, especially since we got that entire theme that literally had the name &quot;Vikings&quot;. But the pros and cons even out, making this an okay figure. He&#39;s not fantastic, but he&#39;s not horrible either.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for this review! Thank you guys for reading, and check out my other reviews and check out my profile as well for a little more info about me. And that&#39;s it for this review!</p>
