"bionic_force","2011-05-14T13:11:03.743Z","The Three D's: Deadly Damn 'Dorable","<p>Judging by the Character Bios over on the official website, the Werewolf is a bit of a red herring. But that certainly doesn't apply to the set itself.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The bag is just the Standard Series 4 display on an orange background, nearly impossible to open without scissors, keys, pen kinfes etc. The 'instructions' are really for those who want to mark the figs off, they just needed something for the other side, alas the most obvious instructions ever.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>After opening the bag, you find the Werewolf (Or any of the others, let's say the Werewolf for this). Every single piece used to make the monster itself are redisigned or recoloured, so far exclusive to this minifigure. The stand has been seen in all the figures before now&nbsp;and the bone have been seen in other sets, although they are considerably more expensive than the Werewolf, such as 2505 Garmardon's Dark Fortress. This is a great way to get the bone, as it's the only set so far to be below Â£20.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>As you can probablly guess, the whole review is essentialy about the minifigure included. Once put together, the figure has great aesthetics and the torn shirt/jeans effect has been pulled off fantastically too and the one white arm, one brown arm really adds to that. It's clear that a lot of thought went into the torso design especially, as next to the sleeveless arm is a huge tear, as if the sleeve has been ripped off from shoulder down. The way the shirt looks like it has been pushed outwards until the buttons popped really gives a good feel as to how strong the Werewolf is.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Plonk, Plonk, Plonk, Plonk, Plonk and DONE! Yeah, it's a minifigure, nothing special about it like the Hazmat Guy's Tube or the Hula Dancer's Grass Skirt, it's just a standard minifig when it comes to the build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>As I said in the Minifigures section, the whole thing looks brilliantly thought through and the rare bone piece makes it worth it. Unfortunately there isn't any backprinting on the shirt, that would have looked great, but the set still looks great on display.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, this is a brilliant little guy, despite being pretty bad for play on it's own, but combined with other Minifigures from the same Genre and I wouldn't half mind getting another one for a little buddy.</p>
<p>A top tip here: When it comes to finding Minifigures you specifically want, feel around for specific pieces, but this one is more difficult to go for, so instead look out for incredibly flat bags, as none of the pieces included&nbsp;are bulky at all, and when smoothed out as much as possible makes the bag incredibly thin, but be careful for the Surfer Girl!</p>
<p>Overall Score: 3/5</p>
<p>Again, I recommend getting this once or twice, wether you play with them or just use the minifigs for pieces, it's a good one to have.</p>",TRUE,3,5,1,3,4

"alva","2011-05-09T21:10:24.943Z","Another Horror Line Minifig","This year Halloween in my Lego city will be a blast after this series 4 minifig collections. We will have witches, vampires, mummies, frankensteins, and lastly the werewolves. <br>Lego is really launching an all out attack on the line of horror minifigs:P<br><br>I think this minifig is quite OK. <br><br>Love the details that put on the design. Torn out shirt, torn out pants. Lego even use different color for right hand (white) and left hand (brown), to show that the left hand shirt area is torn down. I think Lego really put more effort of detailing for the series 4. Great job Lego! Hope to see this new level of detailing on the next sets in the future.<br><br>What I dont like about this minifig is the face. Try to imagine that the color of the head is white instead of brown, and you will get a face of panda. Am I right? Or it just me that imagine it? It will be really great if Lego can make a special mold to create the headgear for this minifig, shaped like a wolf. Then this minifig will be really cool!<br><br>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,3
"AETerry","2011-05-01T13:11:15.96Z","Aaaahooooo! Werewolves of LEGOLand!","<p>The Werewolf minifigure of Series 4 is the latest&nbsp;in the sub-theme of Horror minis in the Collectable Minifigures line. At present there's the Zombie from Series 1, the Witch &amp; Vampire from series 2, Mummy of series 3 and Frankenstien's Monster from Series 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Werewolf is a welcomed addition to the collection with the print jobs for the legs and torso to look as if his clothing has ripped during transformation. The head piece is well done making it clear and obvious what this minifigure is. The hair piece is a dark brown piece similiar to what was used for the Elf in series 3. As a humorous touch, the werewolf is given a bone to hold as an accessory piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LEGO has done Werewolves before as seen in their LEGO Studios theme with the Werewolf Ambush set, and then with Professor Lupin and Greyback in the Harry Potter theme and finally werewolf head pieces in the Monster 4 LEGO game. Still, this Werewolf Minifigure&nbsp;sees the design for the a werewolf mini brought to a new level. Silly as it may be, I've already begun to build up my pack of werewolves to roam the streets of LEGOLand.</p>",TRUE,5,2,1,5,5

I really like his torn shirt and his torn pants and I think LEGO did a great job on the details of the muscles and the face of this character.

get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and

"8BrickMario","2015-10-06T16:30:27.827Z","Over the moon!","<p>The third Halloween-related figure in Series 4, the Werewolf was a must-have for me.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is very nice, with an attractive shade of orange being the series&#39; color.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this minifigure are less than useful, although they are great for the character.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This werewolf is unique among the rest, because he&#39;s the only one who hasn&#39;t finished transforming! He reuses the Series 3 Elf&#39;s hair in dark brown, with the pointed ears being a lighter shade. His face is printed with wolfish features, which include grey fur around the golden eyes, a doglike nose, and some wolf teeth in his growling mouth. His torso shows a ripped shirt that is open to show his furry chest. One of the sleeves of the shirt has apparently torn off, represented by the printing and mismatched arms. &nbsp;His jeans also have a few rips in them, and he carries a small bone as an accessory.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While this may not be the iconic Wolfman most horror fans were expecting, I still think he&#39;s a good minifigure with his own charm.&nbsp;</p>

"sideswinger","2021-03-31T01:16:05.13Z","A great LEGO Werewolf!","<p>The twelfth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Werewolf. This was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that really awesome hair-ear combo. That looks awesome, with the slick design as well as the dark brown colour. It was new for the figure, and I think it&#39;s still exclusive to the figure. Don&#39;t quote me on that though.</p>

<p>Next is the face, which looks appropriately spooky. I really love those big, creepy, yellow eyes, and his big fangs look great as well. All in all, that&#39;s just a great print. He has no alternate face, but that&#39;s okay, because I really do love the one included.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which does have a pretty sweet design overall. I love that ripped design, with the brown fur underneath, and the tore-up white suit looks pretty scary and great as well. One detail I really appreciate is how one of his arms is white, representing the shirt, and the other is brown, representing an exposed arm. I really love that detail He has no back torso printing. It would&#39;ve been great to have more ripped printing, but it&#39;s alright.</p>

<p>And finishing off the figure itself, we have those pants. The colour they&#39;re caste in is great, being that sand blue design. The printing on it is even better, as I really love the claw-marks showing more brown fur.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have his accessory which is a bit lame. It is just that bone piece, but I am thankful we got an accessory at all. I can&#39;t complain much about it, because it is a very fitting accessory, and it does work well with the figure.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure. My overall opinion is that I really do like this figure. Yes, there are much better Werewolves out there, like the one in Series 14. But this is a great figure for 2011, and this is a very different design than the Series 14 one. That was a man turned into a werewolf. This is just a werewolf, and it shows no signs of ever being a human. I know that&#39;s a big stretch, but I just want to emphasise that the Series 14 one wasn&#39;t entirely a remake. Anyway, this figure is a pretty good one, and is definitely upper middle tier for me. Plus, it fits right in with the Series 2 Vampire, the Series 3 Mummy, and even the Series 4 Monster. As always, check out my profile for more information on me, and read my other reviews if you&#39;re interested. Thanks for reading!</p>
