<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I like her better then I do the Ice Skater figure for comparison of female minifigures in Series 4. You've got a light brown hair in a pony tail, a look of concentration as she's on her board surfing the waves or she's not sure she wants to smile and is thinking about something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The torso and leg prints are detailed well enough to convey a wet suit. The pink coloring design on her surf board is very good too. I've a couple of other small sets she could fit in with or the up coming Harbor/Marina sets for City. Otherwise it's very limited beyond collecting purposes of what you can do with this minifigure. </p>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,3

<p>The Surfer Girl has a white surfboard accessory with some very nice printing with what appears to be a pink fire design. The accessory stands out quite nicely. Her wetsuit print is also very detailed though single-sided and has been re-used with similar prints in LEGO City sets. This was the first use of this print though. I enjoy the look of it quite well. Her facial expression is very nice too with a half-smile as she shoots the curls. Her hair piece was first seen in Series 1 and has gotten a lot of re-use since then in many shades.</p>

<p>Overall I really think this minifigure is one of the better offerings from the Series. In fact this one is very smart looking and I enjoy all of the detailing. She is highly recommended if you don&#39;t already own one.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-12-21T20:59:13.663Z","Almost...","<p>So the fifth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Surfer Girl. She was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look at her!</p>

<p>On top we have that hair piece which is nothing special...anymore. Funny enough, back then this was sort of an uncommon hair piece. I say funny enough, because it&#39;s been extremely overused for multiple characters and figures across various themes nowadays. But judging this from a 2011 perspective, this might&#39;ve been a new color for that piece. And even though it is very overused, I still really like the piece, and I think it fits with the figures archetype. I also think its nice how LEGO didn&#39;t laze off and did give us a new color for the piece.</p>

<p>Next we have her face which pretty much has the same situation as the hair. No, this exact expression hasn&#39;t been reused, but the characteristics of the face have. We&#39;ve gotten so many faces like this in LEGO City, Creator, and even future CMF&#39;s. But again, like the hair, that isn&#39;t a problem with this figure; that&#39;s just a gripe I have with the face from a 2020 perspective. If I was judging this in 2011, I would&#39;ve been glad that LEGO gave her an exclusive face, and I still am; I just wish it was a little more unique. No alternate expression, which is common for older CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Next up is her torso, and once again, just like the face and hair, it&#39;s good for 2011, but not for 2020. Starting with the pros, this was and still is an exclusive print, and it does look good; I think the black gray and pink blend really well together. Another good thing is that the torso looks like it could fit right in with any LEGO City setting; but that&#39;s also where a problem erupts, bringing us to the cons of the torso. And like the hair and face, it was probably really cool for 2011, but from 2011 to 2020, we&#39;ve gotten loads of suits like this in LEGO. We&#39;ve gotten many divers, many surfers, and just a lot of torsos that look similar to this. One thing about the torso that differs from the face and hair though, is that the similarity between this and future designs is partly this figures fault. The reason I say that is because they should&#39;ve gone with the more typical surfer stereotype instead of this professional design; I mean when you think of a Surfer, you don&#39;t think of this. I mean sure, typical surfers are normally males, but LEGO has done strange gender swaps before. They could&#39;ve found a way. And the reason the similarity thing is partly caused by this CMF, is because if they would&#39;ve chosen a typical surfer design, they could&#39;ve used this design in LEGO City and made it unique. But instead, they chose to use it with a CMF which in turn, makes for a weak figure. Big mistake by LEGO, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Sorry for that big rant, but we&#39;re not done looking at the figure yet.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, which have a tiny bit of printing on them. It would&#39;ve been easy to have left the leg printing out, but LEGO went the extra mile to add printing to them. I do thank LEGO for ding that, but it isn&#39;t exactly the most complex leg printing out there. But at least they tried!</p>

<p>And lastly, we have her surfboard, which I gotta say, that print is awesome. It&#39;s kind of strange to go from bad to good so fast, but the surfboard does look great. I love those pink flames on it, and it&#39;s just a super useful print if you ask me; It almost makes it worth the three dollar price tag.</p>

<p>But that brings us to the final verdict. And my overall opinion is that this is still a bit of a bad figure. Sure, the surfboard is cool, but is it enough to save the figure? To be honest, this seems like a 2019 to 2021 figure, which is that it has a good accessory but a pretty bad figure. I mean they didn&#39;t put enough work into the figure itself to make this a good figure to me, which is why I&#39;m gonna have to give this a 2. It has a good accessory, which turns 1-star to 2 stars, but I can&#39;t help but feel like the hair, face, torso, and legs are underdone. Almost. This was almost a good figure, but it just fell a little short.</p>

<p>Anyways, that&#39;s it for this review! Sorry for the super long paragraphs, but sometimes the things I wanna say come out super long, which I&#39;m sure any reviewer can identify with. Check out my other reviews, and check out my profile for more info on me, and thanks for reading!</p>
