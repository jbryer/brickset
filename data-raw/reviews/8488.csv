"squareduck","2011-03-21T12:50:24.507Z","Best of the series.","Awesome figure, this makes a great addition as a special response team minifig for the local fire department. The figure is noticeably lighter in color than pictured, being actually closer to yellow than orange. The Helmet is one piece with the visor installed and a stud on the back to connect the tool hose. It may be possible to pop the visor out if you felt the need. The tool is one piece made from the semi-flexible plastic and fits wonderfully into the stud on the back. <br><br><br>Pros: Great new helmet and tool. Perfect figure for a specialized response team.<br><br><br>Cons: None!<br><br><br>Pick him up for sure!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"xccj","2011-03-22T03:33:58.13Z","Hazmat Guy to the Rescue","<p>This is certainly one of the better figs in Series 4.&nbsp; The new suit piece is really amazing, with a built in visor, tubing details, and the hazmat symbol on the front.&nbsp; The back also reuses the design found in some of the older Aquazone suits, with a kind of fan details with a stud.&nbsp; The rubber hose tool wraps around the fig and fits securely into that stud, which is nice.&nbsp; The rubber hose is a nice design, and can easily be used in multiple ways in other MOCs.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I did start to notice some wear on it (where the hand grips it) after a couple of days of play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the fig is pretty cool tool.&nbsp; The torso and legs come in the same light orange color as the suit, and the torso has some good printing on it to make it look good even with the main suit off.&nbsp; And, of course, the frightened head totally gives life to this character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, this is a new idea that hasn't been used before, and the minifigure comes with some cool new parts.&nbsp; (Not to mention that he comes in a fairly new color for minifigures).&nbsp; He would be a great grab if you discover him in one of your Series 4 minifigure bags.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

<p>FINALLY!&nbsp; I found minifigures!&nbsp; These elusive little buggers which are usually consumed by the boxfull were found at a local Target!&nbsp; Looking at the front package, I hoped for the punk rocker or perhaps the mad scientist.&nbsp; Once I saw the entire list, Hazmat became my #1 choice.</p>
<p>Apparently the most wanted of all minifures, Hazmat is very original as I cannot think of any set that would contain such figures.&nbsp; The expression on his face, the original molded helmet (clear face shield does not move), the gun or detector unit is which plugs in nicely to the helmet's backside and the orange/black colour scheme all make this a truley unique and collectible figure.</p>
<p>Having a team of these guys (different heads of course - maybe using the Alpha team heads) would be a fun little addition to a town with a bunch of lego zombies.</p>

I like him enough to have found and gotten two and as my little one would like me to get another Ice Skater and Geisha (for the fan accessory), I may try to see if I can get a couple more of this one for MOCing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The orange coloring and radiation print design on the torse are very well done. His helmet piece is well detailed and molded, especially with the clear visor that's made so the helmet doesn't open up. I like the expression on the minifigure's face of fear and extreme worry. Finishing out this minifigure is the nozzle spray gun and it's hose piece that connects to the back of the suit.</p>

"BrickTVReviews","2011-06-27T10:44:15.38Z","Could a LEGO City Hazmat Subtheme Possible?","<p>Hello welcome and I am gonna review set 8804 Collectable Minifigures Series 4. The Hazmat Guy is one of the best and fist collectable minifig series 4 that I bought. Anyway</p>
<h4>Level Of Difficulty</h4>
<p>The top helmet is one piece and the visor is clipped in with the helmet so this could be the largest easisest piece to search for because there aren't any wimilar pieces in S4. Easy to find.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pieces</h4>
<p>They are pretty <em>promising....</em></p>
<p>Among the 2 accesories is a gun and a helmet mask.The gun is made from rubber. There are dtails on the gun and helmet i.e locking handles on the helmet and handle in gun. The gun should be connected to the back of the helmet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Model [Finished]</h4>
<p>The minifigure is great! Its the first time TLC is doing a hazmat miniman. Nothing I could say here, maybe it's exclusiveness is why fans love it, it's one of the best S4 minis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Story Corner</h4>
<p>As stated in title: ""<strong>Could a LEGO City Hazmat Subtheme Possible?""</strong></p>
<p>maybe no, Eurobricks member <strong>LightningTiger</strong> said that a NEW Paradisa like subtheme and/or theme is coming in 2012. Not counting that there are rumors floating in Eurobricks that a new Police and Coast Guard hybrid subtheme is coming in 2012 or 2013 and not also counting the fact that the Cargo and Emergency subthemes could go back in production next year so it is unlikely for Hazmat subtheme coming next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Final Verdict</h4>
<p>Following the easy to search helmet and it's exclusiveness you should get this before S5 comes out in July or August.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that this sounds kind of childish, but for all those people that like to play with their Legos, this guy is ready also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This Lego figure has an awesome helmet, the ""Hazardous Materials"" symbol and to top it all off... is in an exelent shade of orange and black hands. He also has a Haz-Mat gun which makes him that much more awesome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To really sum it all up, awesome minifigure. I would most definitley reccomend this minifigure to anyone.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"GeluNumber1","2011-06-28T18:19:17.057Z","Hazmat's a good buy","<p>Hazmat Guy is, in a single word, greatness.</p>
<p>&nbsp; First, he's easy to find in a sea of packets. He has a bulky helmet, so you can feel it right away. And he has special&nbsp;bumps on his packet.</p>
<p>&nbsp; His parts are awesome. Again, the helmet. It's unique to this&nbsp;one set.&nbsp;The back has an encircled fan, with an indentation in the middle where the tube/nozzle/sucker thing connects. And that part, too, is only found here. His head has a comical look, furrowed in fear. The torso is decorated with a hazmat sign, and some wrinkles. The legs are normal. Oh, and all but the head are orange.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The buld is really simple: Snap all the parts together, and connect the hose to the back. That's all there is.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The playability is minimal. Sure, you can pose him and set him in a diorama, but that's it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Overall, Hazmat Guy's actually a good buy if you're a collector, if you want rare parts, or if you just think he looks cool. I recommend him.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

The entire figure and parts of it can easily be fitted to suit your own MOC in many of the LEGO themes. A bunch of these could play an important part in say, Alien conquest.

"sideswinger","2021-03-31T19:18:07.28Z","one AWESOME CMF!","<p>The thirteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Hazmat Guy. This figure includes 6 pieces, was released in 2011, and retailed for three dollars. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>So on top we have that mask piece, and that might be the best part of this figure. I just love so much about it. On top, we have that little round moulding, which is cool, and the back has some really awesome moulding too, as does the front. I also love the black printing on the front too. But I think my favourite part of the mould is probably the dual-moulded transparent plastic in the front. That looks really fantastic. That piece was new for the figure as well. Overall, that piece is not only incredible for 2011, but is incredible to this day, and is one of the best pieces in this whole series.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which is another incredible part. It has a very worried expression, which I am just in love with. That face is exclusive, and it&#39;s one of my favourite worried expressions ever. He has no alternate face, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which is yet another amazing piece. It has some really awesome printing, with the black belt on the bottom, and there&#39;s even printing under that mask piece, which is incredible considering it can&#39;t be seen without removing the mask. He has no back torso printing.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have no printing. However, I do really appreciate how the top section is black and the legs themselves are orange.</p>

<p>And on top of a really amazing figure, he even has an accessory. He includes that little black sprayer piece, which even connects to the back of the mask using a pole connection, if I&#39;m not mistaking. All in all, that&#39;s just a great piece.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure! As a whole, this is one of the best figures in the series, if not my favourites of all. And even better, this one of my favourite CMF&#39;s ever. I just love this thing so darn much. The pieces are amazing, the colours are cool, the prints are fantastic, and the price of three dollars isn&#39;t bad either. All in all, this is a great figure. As always, check out my profile as well as my other reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
