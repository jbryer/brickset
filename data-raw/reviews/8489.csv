"Gray_Ghost","2011-04-15T10:52:51.373Z","Cool, but missing something vital","Woohoo, first to review this set, as it says in the title it is missing something but I will get to that later.<div><br></div><div>The hair&amp;face: We see the return of the skateboarder's hair which was last seen in the S2 surfer, as my sister pointed out they look very much like brothers (I noted that it could just be a similar face) but it fits, but now I am branching off. We get another scruffy looking face grinning because he (supposedly) won.</div><div><br></div><div>The torso: On the torso we get a soccer player print (doctor who S5 anyone) with various companies such as Lego and Octan as&nbsp;sponsors and since it does not have a number on his back printing you can make a whole team. It does have back printing but it is just blue and white stripes.</div><div><br></div><div>Shorts: Not much to say there, they are cool but in my opinion they make this part restricting, as it does not work for the normal city figures with all the logos on it.</div><div><br></div><div>The ""accessory:"" Well this is what is missing, Lego gave this guy a trophy, yes a trophy. For those of us who did not own any of the old sports sets it was a pretty stupid choice&nbsp;to give this guy a trophy and not a SOCCER BALL! The only scene that you can make is this team on a platform with the losing team&nbsp;shamefully&nbsp;walking off the field.</div><div><br></div><div>Closing thoughts: well a good figure, if a bit lacking, 4/5.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,2,4

"United_Bricks","2011-10-08T16:18:30.55Z","Review of set 8804 Soccer player","This little minifigure was hard to get for me, but I finally picked him up at tesco.

The soccer player hair colour is light brown. <br>He has stubble on his face and he has a grin like he's won. <br>His torso is double sided with a blue and white soccer strip. On the torso there is a Octan logo and a lego brick logo.<br>His legs have printing on them, there is a yellow strip and theres a lego brick logo and another badge on the legs.<br><br>The trophie<br>The trophie is a silver mini lego man this time, so now we have the bronze, gold and silver trophie. The trophie stand is black and is the piece what you get in the lego indiana jones canal chase set, it is the bad guys hat, but this time its black instead of dark red. For the bottom you add a black stud.<br><br>You get a black stand to put him on.

"AETerry","2011-05-08T10:25:47.307Z","Soccer Player Review","<p>I guess I'm not complaining too much about the lack of a soccer ball as I'd picked up a small mixed lot of LEGO accessories when trying to get skate boards and got some soccer balls with it that were from 2001-2002 when LEGO did have Sports Theme going. So it's like 4-5 soccer balls and no Soccer Players or use for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Soccer Player allows me a chance to make use of those pieces now. He's got some very good print details for his shirt front &amp; back and sponsor logo. Even his legs have a good print to show he's wearing shorts. The minifigure's face is good too, having a bit of a rugged, unshaven look. He's got rare, brown wind swept hair that's been showing up on a few minifigures or sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And where the Karate Master and Sumo Wrestler have gold and bronze trophies, the Soccer Player comes with a silver trophy for 2nd place, thus completing out a ""mini collection"" for a larger MOC idea of handing out trophies. I don't care much for the slight build with this particular trophy to give it more of a larger base. The straight up silver piece would have been fine for me. I'm sure though others like it. I may switch it over to a gold trophy and play around on smaller bases for the trophies later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He's a fun and great figure. If you can get several of them for a team, that'd be great, alone he's fine for a collection. Otherwise not much that you can do. But he's good.</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,3,4
"clundsberg","2011-04-30T13:21:58.82Z","He shoots! He scores another minifigure!","<p>Well, I am off today with my son in hopes that some of these minifigures still exist at the local Targ√©t :)</p>
<p>I scored this Soccer player yesterday (with the Hazmat guy) as an end-of-the week gift to my son for being such a cool kiddo.&nbsp; Much like the the Hot Wheels Mystery cars, my son takes great pleasure in *not* knowing what mystery minifigure he's about to open.&nbsp; Fortunately (so far) unlike the Hot Wheels, no one can tamper with and pry these open to cheat.&nbsp; Really, Hot-Wheels people, that is SO annoying.</p>
<p>I enjoy that Lego's website has little bios for all of their minifigure characters as well as animations on the minifigure logo (except for hazmat :/ ).&nbsp; It's a nice touch and the writing is very entertaining.&nbsp; Give it a look if you have not gone: <a href=""http://minifigures.lego.com/en-us/Bios/Default.aspx"">http://minifigures.lego.com/en-us/Bios/Default.aspx</a></p>
<p>This guy comes with a cool little trophy for 2nd place (also mentioned in his bio) a very nicely decaled print on torso and legs, cool soccer-player hair...he's one handsome Lego dude.&nbsp; It's too bad he did not come with a ball.&nbsp; I also wish&nbsp;they would label their stands with the figure name as it would be a nice touch for display.</p>
<p>The one aspect I have issue with in the price: it's not horrible seeing as you are essentially paying $3 for an action figure, but it almost seems like you are paying $1 more for the mystery/collectibility aspect &lt;?&gt;&nbsp; It's nit-picking, but for example $1 more gets you the traveller or BBQ&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;which come with buildable accessories, while a couple bucks more can buy you the Jester or Farmer that includes bricks to build with.&nbsp; As a further comparison $10 gets you the Toy Story Army set which is around 4 figures and a Jeep (which at the mystery minifigure price alone should be closer to $12 - not including Jeep and the fact it is a franchise series which normally would cost more (see Star Wars))&nbsp; I can accept the $3 price, but just had to get that out there in hopes a few of you readers will nod a bit in approval :)</p>
<p>Overall: pick these up if you see them.&nbsp; You may get doubles, you will always get original figures and they are great as rewards or stocking-stuffers and can individualize your Lego cities.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,2

"TooMuchLEGO","2011-11-06T20:01:10.47Z","He may have Silver, but a gold figure in my opinion.","<p>The Soccer player is one of the three Series 4 minifigures I own. This one I quite like. The figure has great detail and really nice LEGO parts- every thing about this figure is great. The hair I don't think is in many sets, so it's great to have. If only it were brown though. Anyway onto the pros and the cons.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The rare hair</li><li>Detail</li><li>Shorts</li><li>""Octan"" reference</li><li>Trophy</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Chinese plastic, making it not as durable.</li><li>A Soccer ball would have been better than a trophy</li></ul>
<p>Overall a really good fig, glad to have him. Now to get 21 more so I can have enough to play a full game. :-)</p>",TRUE,5,4,1,2,4
"sideswinger","2021-03-30T19:04:18.663Z","GOOD figure, and a BAD figure???","<p>The eleventh figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Soccer Player. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 7 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have a pretty sweet hair piece, which is that side-swept hair caste in a nougat colour. That looks good, and isn&#39;t extremely common in that colour.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which is my favourite part of the figure. I really love the chipper expression, as well as that little stubble on his chin, and it&#39;s just a very well done print that is exclusive to the figure.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, which does look good. I do really appreciate the Octan logo, as well as the blue, white, and yellow colour scheme. He has some great back torso printing as well, which are three blue stripes down his back.</p>

<p>And finishing off the figure itself, we have those legs. They do have some good printing, with the yellow skin showing through on the front and the sides, and the little icons above the yellow skin looks good as well.</p>

<p>And we are just cruising along here, as the next thing to talk about is his build-up accessory. It consists of two pieces: that cone, and the micro-figure. The cone isn&#39;t the usual cone piece, and it&#39;s nice to see in black, though it isn&#39;t exclusive. I really love that silver micro-figure, with all its moulding all around. I think it was new for the figure in that colour as well.</p>

<p>And despite this review being abnormally short, I have a lot to say abut the final verdict. First off, the figure itself is great, with the nice printing as well as the nice pieces. But the reason I don&#39;t like it is that this is supposed to be soccer player. When you look at the figure, you don&#39;t say &quot;hey look! A soccer player!&quot;, as this does not at all say soccer to me. When you think of a soccer player, you think of something from the DFB Minifigure Series. This is just not a very soccer-esque figure to me at all. And why do I think that? Well first, it&#39;s just as simple as the fact that it doesn&#39;t look like a soccer player. I mean the colours are just too vibrant, and it does not work. And perhaps the thing that ticks me off most about this figure, is this: where the heck is the gosh-darn soccer ball??? I mean seriously LEGO? We need a soccer ball in a stinking soccer player! That is just awful if you ask me. But again, the printing and stuff is good, so this is both a good figure, and a bad one. But I think that&#39;s it for the figure! Check out my profile, as well as my other LEGO reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
