"The_Reviewer","2011-04-07T00:09:22.91Z","Time to paint!","<p>I got this minifigure at Toys R us for 2.99 and I was surprised to find this Minifig. He comes with a palet piece with colors splated on it&nbsp;, a paintbrush with green paint on the tip, The same hat the Mime has&nbsp;from series 2. The torso has some paint splatted on it and&nbsp;some on the pants.</p>

"Nesquik","2011-04-08T06:36:16.73Z","Vincent van Lego","In short, I believe this to be up with the best minifigures not just from Series 4, but from all those preceding it. Everything is spot on - the level of detail on his clothing (which is splattered in paint, almost as he if he couldn't care less!), the unique palette item, the expression on his face which is one of attention and concentration, and even the French beret.<div><br></div><div>Only minor niggle is the paintbrush item, which may be a little tricker to click/remove from the minifigures hand, and if done incorrectly it can fly off. But once in place, the brush is sturdy and won't be going anywhere.</div><div><br></div><div>I place my minifigures on a shelf, and have put this Artist along side the Kimono Girl as if he is painting her. On paper the two would seem ridiculous together, but they actually make a perfect match because the Kimono Girl has little playability on her own, but because she is so picturesque, the Artist makes a fine accompaniment as if he was painting her.</div><div><br></div><div>Don't hesitate to claim this one!&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"alva","2011-05-09T22:03:47.173Z","Masterpiece Artist","I love this minifig. I think Lego starts to put more effort on detailing the minifigs on the series 4, which is a really good news for us.<br><br>What I like about this set? <br>I love the simplicity of the design for this minifig. Just a plain white shirt with a scarf and brown pants, but they put some paint splash to show artist on work. Nice! This is what an artist should look like in my mind:P<br><br>And this minifig really bring two nice addition to the minifig accessories, the paint palette and the brush. Both of them is really cool.<br><br>You can put the artist around your city. Posing it like he is painting a landmark in your city? Or maybe in a carnival area on your city, acting like a paint-to-order for the visitors? Or maybe he is in the farm/field area, doing a landscape painting? You name it. <br><br>The only minor thing in this minifig for me :<br>Do you notice that he has a spash of purple color on his leg? How come he can have a purple color if he doesnt have a purple in his pallette? Yes, I know it is really minor and don't ruin anything, it just something that bothering me.<br><br>For you city lover, you should at least have one. More is recommended, since you can put him anywhere in your city!<br><br><br>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,4
"AETerry","2011-05-15T12:06:43.267Z","Artist Review","<p>I had only wanted 1 and instead I manage to get 4 of these guys, I may throw up a couple for trade later on...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a delightful little minifigure... I want to say in the style of a French artist? with his black beret and clothing choice with the shirt and scarf. The print style is a case of simplicity winning out for the design as LEGO completes the look with having the Artist's clothing stained and having splashes of paint on them. Then you have the Artist's accessories of a paint palatte and paint brush to complete out his look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At $2.99, he's not bad... the extra dollar is still hurting a bit for wanting to pick these up, especially when you're getting these minifigures up in multiples.</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,4,4
"clundsberg","2011-05-01T00:23:50.28Z","L'artist L'ego","<p>So I trudged on back to wally-world determined to track down a few&nbsp;other minis, the artist being one of them.&nbsp; This is what Dad's apparently do for their 6-year old sons who would like this particular one as they are artists themselves...albiet in crayola markers and crayons.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with wal-mart being close by, the fact that I have a BFA in Art or that I too might be addicted to Legos...</p>
<p>&gt;_&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;_&lt;</p>
<p>&gt;_&gt;</p>
<p>a-hem, ok, This figure is fantastic!&nbsp; I identified him by finding the paintbrush which is easy to identify by feeling for the slight brush-bulb at the end of the short stick.&nbsp; the palette is also easy to identify by the pac-man-like notch in an otherwise round shape.&nbsp; One may (as I almost did) mistake the viking shield for this if not careful.</p>
<p>The afore-mentioned palette and brush are very unique pieces as is the artist himself (well&nbsp;I guess they&nbsp;all are&nbsp;really) the barét is a great touch as is his artist-like goatee.&nbsp; For added effect, feel free to add a coffee cup and cigarette butts.&nbsp; Printing out some small perhaps pixelated Lego pictures is a fun way to show off his ""art.""</p>
<p>Details on the figure show paint-splatter to coincide with his palette.</p>
<p>Definitely worth spending 15 minutes going through half of the mini-figs display for...*sigh*</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"sideswinger","2021-03-31T21:47:51.91Z","an EXCELLENT CMF!","<p>The fourteenth figure in the LEGO Minifgures Series 4 is the Artist. This includes 7 pieces, was released in 2011, and retailed for three dollars. Now let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that very nice hat piece. It wasn&#39;t new to the figure, but that&#39;s okay because it&#39;s a very fitting design. I love the pointy side, and it just looks cool all around.</p>

<p>Next we have his face print, and it looks extremely awesome. I love the concentrated expression, with the eyebrows and all, and that little goatee looks swell as well. No alternate expression, but that&#39;s okay because that hat would leave it exposed.</p>

<p>Next we have that great torso design. I really love the design of the blue collar, and the splattered paint looks awesome. There&#39;s some black and red splatters on the front, and no printing whatsoever on the back, which is slightly disappointing. Still, it&#39;s a great design.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which ave some more great splattered paint printing. One leg has a purple slater, and the other as a sky blue one. Those prints both look great. The colour of the legs themselves is fantastic as well, with that light brown design.</p>

<p>And the last thing to discuss is his two accessories, which are my favourites part of this figure. Both of those pieces were new for him, if I&#39;m not mistaking. They aren&#39;t exclusive any more, but they&#39;re still fantastic pieces for a 2011 CMF. First, he has that paint brush, which has quite a bit of printing on it, like the white rim and the green and brown tip. I love how that looks in his hand as well. But he also includes that palette piece, which is even cooler than the brush. That paint palette is an amazing part that was new for the figure, and an amazing part, not just for 2011, but for LEGO in general. I really do love the yellow, blue, red, and green printing on it, and I also love the hole etched in there. Those are just two amazing accessories, if you ask me.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure! As a whole, this might be my favourites in the whole Series 4. The new pieces, the printing, the accessories, everything about this figure is just so awesome, and this is one of my favourite CMF&#39;s ever. As always, check out my profile as well as my other reviews, and thank you for reading!</p>
