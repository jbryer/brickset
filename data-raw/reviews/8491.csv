"Nesquik","2011-04-09T05:22:23.423Z","Lawn Knome","You'd be forgiven for mistaking him with the 'Fisherman', but this 'Lawn Gnome' has lost a few pounds as he's considerably smaller! There are many distinctive aspects to this this set; the short-legs that give him a stumped appearance are obviously a give away and are rarely seen in other sets (apart from, lately, young Lego people), but the primary colours also highlight this fella belongs in the garden. The bright blue, red and green absolutely stand out.<div><br></div><div>However, the only aspect of the product that is a bit niggling is the fishing rod and its line. On the 'Fisherman' product, the line was weighed down by having a fish attached to the end, but because the line is quite stiff when left slack, it won't fall down naturally. This means that, because the Knome has nothing attached to the end of his line, it will not fall like the one in the promotional images. This is annoying, but the only solution is to squeeze the line at the tip of the fishing rod for an extended period of time.</div><div><br></div><div>Favorite part of this set is his little hat which is very unusual. I don't believe I've seen one like it before, but it looks so typically a Knome hat that it may be unique.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a very distinctive set that really stands out from other Minifigures, so for collections I think it makes a perfect addition. In terms of playability, perhaps less so because a real Knome would rarely be that scale, but its not a problem.</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4

"AETerry","2011-05-08T09:42:06.757Z","Lawn Gnome Review","<p>It's not too bad of a minifigure. I'm half tempted to see if I can track down and get six more of this minifigure for a Snow White and the 7 Dwarves MOC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The job is good for his shirt, the hat I believe is new, like a green version of what the Smurfs wear. The beard is the same as what was used for the Fisherman Minifigure from Series 3. He's also got a brown fishing pole. The facial print for under the beard can be used for depicting an old minifigure in other MOCs. And since I've only a few of them on hand at current, there's the short legs for smaller or child minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't see keeping him as just a Lawn Gnome in my MOCs. Collectors wanting to be completists will want to pick him up for certain. But if you weren't looking for him, there's good features to be had and use in play.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-22T20:03:20.543Z","It's GNOMEAGEDON!","<p>Set #8804 Lawn Gnome: The Collectible Mini-Figures are always hit or miss. I personally did not have much use for the Lawn Gnome, however it is still a very strongly put together design for a Mini-Fig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It includes the Fisherman's Beard piece, a nice new Green Hat, smaller blue legs, the Fisherman's Fishing Rod in a Brown color and a red torso piece with nifty looking gnomish outfit print that could match any number of MOC figures. The facial print almost looks like it would make a good design for a Santa Mini-Fig, with age-lines and a happy smile, plus white beard and side-burn prints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, though I wasn't too thrilled about this Mini-Fig your results may vary, and I'd say he is at least something unique and new for LEGO Mini-Figs. I just wish I could have gotten more from Series 4 before it vanished from Retail.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,3
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-07-24T14:51:46.877Z","Awesome. That word should be enough.","<p>When I picked up some Series 4, I wasn't expecting this little dude. But he came out of one of the packages, and here he is. He's pretty awesome.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hat I find would work great on <i>Zelda 64</i>&nbsp;MOCs to make the Kokiri species from the game, and the torso looks like it would work better on Santa than his current one. The fishing pole is fantastic too, and the short legs are always welcome! The beard is also fantastic, perfect for a little minifig of his proportions. Great little addition to the LEGO Minifigures theme, and a LEGO collection!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4><div>Hooray for my favorite part! The pros! I'll have fun listing these...</div>
<ul><li>Lovely torso</li><li>Great little beard</li><li>Short Legs!</li><li>Fishing Pole (which isn't too common I believe)</li><li>His face looks fantastic.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4><div>Ugh. Cons. Well, it's hard to place cons on a figure like this.</div>
<ul><li>He's basically perfect, but I wish his hat faced backwards instead (yes I want a Link minifig)- more of a complaint than an actual con.</li></ul>
<p>Overall- wonderful fig! Arguably the best minifigure I've recieved so far. I'm also gonna agree with what AETerry said- the hat looks like a green Smurf one as well- so Smurf MOCing time people. Try and get it- even if you hate lawn gnomes, there's a lot of nifty pieces in here.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,2,5
"1UPminifig","2014-09-23T18:10:40.083Z","Lawn Gnome's Go.........Fishing? ","<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;But the joke&#39;s on you if you pick him up and carry him home to your front yard, because if you don&#39;t give him something interesting to look at, he&#39;ll pack up his fishing pole and pointy green hat and be off on his way!&rdquo; &ndash; quote from </em>LEGO.com</p>

<p>Thankfully, I apparently gave the Lawn Gnome something interesting to look at as he remains a cool little minifigure in my collection. Like most of the Collectable Minifigures I own, The Lawn Gnome was a happy surprise on the quest of finding a chosen character (or in the case of Series 4, historical figures). I hadn&rsquo;t expected to like him but now glad to have him.</p>

<h3>Polybag and Instructions</h3>

<p>(This is a review of the series 4 polybag for a more detailed look at polybags in general check out my Mariachi Guy and Disco Dude reviews from my profile page.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read my last few reviews, you&rsquo;ll know that I dread the colour scheme of the Series 4 polybag. While I&rsquo;m sure the casual buyer cares little about the polybag colours, the polybag colour is what first catches your eye on the shelf and tells you which series and therefore I believe the appearance matters in the process of anticipation. Personally, I think this terrible coloring of the packaging must be addressed and you&rsquo;re welcome to read past this part and go straight to Build below.</p>

<p>Maybe my perception is influenced by some of the truly phenomenal colour choices we have had in Series 1-3 and I was impressed with the fantastic gold packaging for Series 10. With Series 4, the orange is too bright as well as too dark at the same time, causing it to neither to stand out nor be visually mild. To me, even the black polybags of Series 8 is a better choice than this orange (and I believe Series 8 came out for Halloween, which gave it an excuse, though there was a Santa Claus included that was curious).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone over the instructions numerous times in my other reviews and there&rsquo;s not much to add here.&nbsp; The instructions come on a doubly-sided printed sheet with a checklist on one side and a how to on build a minifigure on the other. &nbsp;The colour of the packaging changes from series to series, this time being the same horrid orange of the polybag.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build of the Lawn Gnome has additional parts due the building the accessory (fishing pole has a brown fishing rod and black string fishing line) which requires snapping the fishing line to the bottom and top portion of the fishing rod.&nbsp; There is also a white beard in addition to having a hat, which snaps on like a necklace when the minifigure&rsquo;s head is removed.</p>

<p>The fishing pole that that the Lawn Gnome carries is not terribly difficult build, however being such a rare build it may offer some confusion for those who have never dealt with the pieces. The fishing rod comes it two pieces, the pole proper and the string with the lure. On the side of the pole there is a two holes where you can place the stud on the lure (there&rsquo;s not much difference on which side you put on). Next you grab the string part of the lure and pull it over what I&rsquo;m going to call the claw of the pole (you may have to straighten out the line a bit) and you have successfully built a LEGO fishing rod.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p><strong>Helmet/Hair</strong>: The Lawn Gnome&rsquo;s head is appropriately enough covered by his dark green pointy hat made famous by its real world counterpart, the Garden Gnome, though the tip is the version that falls forward. The Lawn Gnome&rsquo;s dark green hat compliments the primary colours of the rest of the minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Head</strong>:&nbsp;The Lawn Gnome eyebrows are whitish grey, thick and bushy and compliments the bushy white beard made of a solid plastic mold. As a bonus LEGO also included one on his head and it&rsquo;s a truly wonderful looking print. It&rsquo;s a white snowy beard with a line of grey around the bottom to add contrast and the sideburns go all the way to the cut off of the printing at the top of head. His eyes have a grandfatherly compassionate look to them (especially with the wrinkles around the eyes!).</p>

<p>Torso: The Lawn Gnome comes with a bright red jacket that fits the character snuggly, apparently, as the drawn black belt with bronze belt buckle yields horizontal and vertical creases at the top and bottom that indicate an overflow of belly. Unfortunately, the decorative ink is prone to wearing off when the character is handled too often. What you won&rsquo;t know from looking at the promotional images is that the shirt collar design that is covered by the beard accessory.</p>

<p><strong>Legs</strong>: The shorter mold legs are known by many names within the LEGO community, including &ldquo;kid legs&rdquo;, &ldquo;dwarf legs&rdquo; but I prefer to use &ldquo;small legs&rdquo;.&nbsp; The legs are a classic bright blue and lack &ndash; what I suppose are the thighs &ndash; of the typical minifigure legs, resulting in the legs being about half the size of the regular ones.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong>: &nbsp;The Lawn Gnome comes with a long brown fishing rod with a black fishing line which uses the same mold (different colour: black) as the Series 3 Fisherman. It&rsquo;s a decent representation of a fishing pole in LEGO; however, I&rsquo;m not sure how it fits with being paired with a Lawn Gnome.</p>

<p>The white beard is actually an accessory piece rather than headwear. This is the same beard piece used by the Series 3 Fisherman and all the modern Santas (long beards no longer being used). The beard is not as bright white as the promotional images show.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The playability of the Lawn Gnome is quite limited compared to other Collectable Minifigures (he&rsquo;s not small enough for a LEGO lawn) and most of the value will most likely be derived from MOCking the pieces. If they ever make a red version of the cap you might be able to make your very own Travelocity Gnome (ha ha). Another real world likeness you could make with some of the pieces is the mascot of Beard Papa (Google it).</p>

<h3>Suggested Pairings</h3>

<p>The Lawn Gnome because of his fishing pole goes with any beach sea setting such as 4644<em>-1: Marina &nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<em>4642-1: Fishing Boat</em>&nbsp;from the City subtheme of Harbor. If you want another Collectible Minifigure to go with this guy, the Series 3 Fisherman would be the right pairing. Perhaps they are cousins. That like to fish.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The Lawn Gnome, in my opinion, came as an unexpected satisfying surprise, especially with the bonus beard accessory. The primary colours - yellow, blue, red and green, plus white - is the LEGO colour palette, and so he goes with everything that is basic brick. While I don&rsquo;t understand the reason for the fishing pole, I&rsquo;m not complaining to have this rare piece. 4 out of 5.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-09-01T23:53:12.553Z","One AWESOME figure!","<p>So the first figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Lawn Gnome, and I love how this guy turned out. He was released in 2011, includes 8 pieces, and retailed for three dollars. So let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>On top we have that pointy hat piece, which I really love. I apologise, but I am terrible at knowing what parts were new for what, so this hat might&#39;ve been a new piece. I really don&#39;t know. If I had to guess, I would say it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;new, but of course, that&#39;s just a guess. Anyway, I love the overall moulding of it, with the ruffles and such in the front, and It just looks awesome. I think it could be used in a lot of custom figures, like maybe Link from the Legend of Zelda, or even your own custom lawn gnome figures.</p>

<p>Then we have the face, which I also really love. I adore that big white beard underneath, as well as the smile, and the white sideburns look nice as well. No back facial printing, which is fine since it&#39;s nonexistent with most CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Next is his beard, which was not new. It was first introduced in the Series 3 Fisherman, which that figure and this one are a lot alike. Nothing wrong with that though, since that was a great figure. The beard here is exactly the same, even down to the coloring, and if you&#39;re curious what material the beard is made of, it is rubber.</p>

<p>Next up is his torso, which I really like how all that came out. I love that big black belt, as well as the buttons along that line, and I think the torso overall is pretty useful outside the setting; especially for Christmas-themed figures, like an Elf or even Santa himself. Heck, you could practically build a Santa just from the pieces provided in all. I mean you got the beard, face, torso-am I&#39;m drifting too far off the subject. Back to the gnome.&nbsp;No back printing if you were wondering.</p>

<p>Finishing up the body of the figure, we have his legs, which are caste in what appears to be a sky-blue color. I do really love whenever LEGO uses that color, so all cool there. And if it was new to the figure, sorry for not knowing. As I said before, I&#39;m terrible at deciphering new pieces.</p>

<p>Then we have his fishing pole build. I say build because it&#39;s made up of two parts; the pole, and the string. And the pole part was (like the beard,) introduced with the Series 3 Fisherman, although that figure had a black one, while this is caste in brown. I&#39;m guessing this was a new color for it, but beats me, Then the black string is the exact same as the Fisherman, but that&#39;s fine by me.</p>

<p>And as a whole, I think this is a fantastic figure. For three dollars you got some excellent parts, fantastic prints, and just an extremely great figure as a whole. This figure is actually either my first or second favorite in the series. If you want to see who the runner-up is, stay tuned for the rest of my Series 4 reviews.&nbsp;Anyway, I hope this review helped you decide whether you wanted to pay for it on Ebay, which the prices for it there are mostly under ten dollars, if you don&#39;t count shipping. That&#39;s a good deal. Anyway, thanks for reading!</p>
