"squareduck","2011-03-21T13:05:07.51Z","Game on!","I was a little skeptical about this figure, being a big hockey fan. I was really surprised by how great this figure is. Granted the helmet cage looks far to footballish, but by swapping it out with a visor he looks perfect. The cage works well for a goalie figure though. The Hockey stick is fun and when placed in the figure's hand he can actually rip a decent slapshot with the black stud puck. The ice skates are actually very good and fit snugly on the feet. I had to run quickly back to the store to scrounge up a few more for my kids to play with and this figure is definitively the overall favorite in my house. I can only hope that a different color comes along for an opposing team to face off with.<br><br><br>Pros: Surprisingly fun and functional, great pieces and playability.<br><br>Cons: The mask really only looks good for a goalie.<br><br>Get the foil on!!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"alva","2011-05-06T00:54:06.943Z","Great Minifig","I never intend to search for this minifig. The only reason for me to have one of them is because my mistake. I try to use my finger to determine the content of the packaging. Found out that the content is including a body armor, and assuming that the only one that have that is the Hazmat guy, I bought the package. Turn out, the content is not the Hazmat guy, but the Hockey Player.<br><br>But I am not dissapointed with this minifig. He really looks cool. The angry face really fit in with the image of a hockey player. I also like the color combination of dark blue and white. Finally, the wolf logo really complete this minifig as a great hockey player.<br><br>I also like the accessories that come with the minifigs. The hockey stick and the skates are both new, I never seen both of them in any set before this.<br><br>Really cool. I think you can build an army of this minifig. And with little modification, you can change him into another sport player. Probably a football player, or even a gladiator?<br><br>Great minifig! <br>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,5
"vexorian","2011-06-20T12:27:07.367Z","A great minifig by itself","You know, if I could have picked a series 4 minifig, the Hockey player would have been among the last in my priorities. I am not a town guy and I am really not a sports guy either. I like space so I was targeting towards the scientist and Hazmat guy. But of course, blind packaging and the dot system is VERY hard to use, so I ended up getting this guy. I was pleasantly surprised.<br><br>There are very good things about this, first let me talk about the useful things for people that wanted sports minifigs. The wolf print in the armor is marvelous. And the uniform could as well be used for American Football as well. The skates are very well done molds, too bad there are no longer extras included in collectable minifigs. <br><br>Now on what is important for LEGO fans in general, specifically the more sci-fi oriented. The armor is a nice brick on itself if you wanted some way to make minifigs more menacing. The wolf printing may be too specific, but the back side of the armor does not have it. The color of the minifig is dark blue, which is something you won't find easily. The torso has no printing, which is probably good if you wanted a generic dark blue torso, but not so good if you wanted more detail. And of course, a dark blue helmet. Too bad it is of the kind that is not air-tight so it is not so useful for space unless you let the kind of willing suspension of disbelief that we used in SW and the first Space police III waves.<br><br>The thing that won my heart is the minifig's head print. It is a very well done tough-guy expression.<br><br>All in all , series 4 is a great series with many minifigs worth having, and the Hockey player does not let this trend down.<br>",TRUE,5,5,1,3,4
"AETerry","2011-05-12T14:53:58.197Z","Hockey Player","<p>I think the only reason I decided to settle on getting this minifigure is that the gear was used in a Brick Webcomic I've been reading....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But yeah, it was easy to a point to find this minifigure by feeling for the armor and hockeystick in the package, other wise I've realized LEGO's been throwing in minifigures to a theme that have similiar feeling accessories. Hmmm...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The print work for the armor is just awesome along with the coloring of blue which I like and then the gear with the hockey stick, helmet and 1x1 round black plate piece for the puck. Him, along with the Baseball player of Series 3 look like they'll be a lot of fun to set around for display and show.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
"clundsberg","2011-05-01T00:09:06.497Z","Determination!","<p>That is what I used as I felt up half the bags on display to find 2 of these guys, (one as a gift)&nbsp;the artist (the things I do for my son) and the punk rocker (the things I do for me :D)</p>
<p>This one is especially great as it comes with all the gear: (unlike a certain soccer player we all know and love)&nbsp;helmet with raisable mask protection, skates, pads, stick and puck.&nbsp; The over accessorizing on this one makes up for the lack of pieces on, say, the monster.</p>
<p>no good option for holding the skates to keep him on the stand, so I opted for having the skates on and balancing him between the pegs.</p>
<p>A great mini for hockey fans (a bonus if you like a team with the same colour scheme or one that uses a wolf logo. fun to collect these guys and perhaps customize.</p>
<p>Fairly easy to identify through the package due to the L-shaped stick but only found 2 half-way through an dstopped (much like the artist).</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"GeluNumber1","2011-06-29T18:13:25.083Z","Goooal!","<p>Hockey Player was not my first choice in getting a Minifig, but it's now one of my favorites. Why? For three main reasons: The parts, the rarity, and the look. The parts are awesome--dark blue all around, and a hockey stick. The chestplate is cool, along with the aforementioned hockey stick. I also like the skates and helmet. </p>
<p>&nbsp; It's kinda hard to get. I looked around for a good 10&nbsp;minutes before stumbling across it, making it a trophy of sorts.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Finally, it looks vicious. He has a scowl and furrowed eyebrows. He looks as if he'll kill you just by bumping you in the shoulder. Yes, he has quite a bit of character in him.</p>
<p>&nbsp; So, go get him, tiger!</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,3
"tkettle9719","2012-01-10T18:07:23.24Z","Behold The Skater Boy!","<p>I got this minifig for myself from Borders before they all closed down, and think that this may very well be one of the premier minifigs in the whole theme.<br></p>

<ul><li>-A darker puck hitter (I can't think of the right word) would have been better.<br></li><li>-The lack of detail in the torso is a bit disappointing.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is excellent, and looks very great and detailed. I highly recommend this set to fans of the sports miniseries of the collectable minifigures.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"StarKiller22515","2020-02-09T22:42:54.687Z","LEGO on ice","<p>I personally really like the colours on this figure. The rare pieces of the Helmet, chest piece, mask, and hockey stick make this a very good purchase. The printing on the legs and chest piece are also done very well.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-01-12T22:50:28.033Z","A great figure, with great pieces!","<p>So the eighth figure in the LEGO Minifigure Series 4 is the Hockey Player. He includes 9 pieces, retailed for&nbsp;three dollars, and was released in 2011. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting him off, we have that amazing helmet. Of course, the best part is that awesome face shield piece, but the actual helmet base piece is pretty great too. It has a really nice dark navy blue color, which is not the most common piece for that color. Of course, though, the shield piece is the best part of the helmet. I love all the intricate holes in it and I love how you can see that angry face underneath. Also, it was a new piece, which is really cool as well.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has a very fitting angry expression. I love those barred teeth, and I love how well it can be seen through the helmet. No alternate expression, which is a bit unfortunate, but it&#39;s okay since alternate expressions were rare back then.</p>

<p>Next we have that awesome breastplate, with that white wolf printing, and I really like how rounded the shoulders are. And what&#39;s even cooler is that the back of the breastplate has printing too, which is so awesome overall.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which as far as I can tell, has no printing. It would&#39;ve been nice to get printing on it, but to be honest, a plain dark blue torso isn&#39;t exactly common, so I can&#39;t really complain much there.</p>

<p>And finishing off the figure itself, we have his legs which do have exclusive printing. Those white shin guards do look nice, but it would&#39;ve been cool to get side printing. It isn&#39;t a huge deal though, and printing on the front is fine with me.</p>

<p>Finally, we have his accessories, which are pretty&nbsp;incredible. I love that hockey stick so much, from the moulding on the handle, down to the curve at the end. And from my understanding, that piece was new and exclusive to the figure at the time of its release, so that&#39;s great. And even though it isn&#39;t shown in the image, he includes a plain black stud as a hockey puck. While a black 1x1 round tile would&#39;ve worked better, it&#39;s incredible that they even took the time to include a puck at all. And if two wasn&#39;t good enough, this figure has those ice skates as well, which look incredible. Those were new for this series, as they came in another series 4 figure as well, and a review for that figure is coming in a while. But man, the effort put into this dude is outstanding.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s that! Overall, this is by far one of my favourites in the series, and I am just totally in love with how he came out. So much effort was put into him, that he might just be my favourite in the series. But that is it for this review! Check out my profile to know more about me, and read my other reviews as well. Thanks for reading!</p>
