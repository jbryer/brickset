"alva","2011-05-06T02:36:43.753Z","Just So-So","Having heard that this is the rarest minifig in the minifig collection series 4, I decided that I must have at least one of this minifig. So, when the minifig coll series 4 firstly appear on a store near my house, I rushed to go there.<br><br>Found two crazy scientists in one box. I don't know if there suppose to be more, cause I am using the classic touch-and-feel technique.<br><br>The minifig is just so-so. Nothing wonderful about it that should make this the rarest minifig on collection 4.<br><br>Have to admit that the hair is new design, and it's not plastic but some kind of rubber. Like the hair for the exoforce minifig. Using rubber surely can make the shape of the hair more varied compared using regular plastic. The vial is also OK. But other than that, this is just regular minifig. I think if Lego can create a hair piece that can add eyeglasses, that will make the minifig really cool.<br><br>The torso is OK, shows a lab coat that looks kind of old, something that I imagine that the scientist on World War 2 would use. And it also shows some green splash, probably want to show that the liquid in the vial is splashed to his lab coat. But nothing so special about the torso and legs.<br><br>So, don't buy this minifig, unless you want to complete your series 4 collection.<br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
"AETerry","2011-05-02T20:07:49.507Z","Weird Science!","<p>This must be a rare figure indeed, I opted for the e-bay route of getting one. Make sure you watch out for the shipping and handling charges. The Crazy Scientist ended up being just a bit more expensive then I'd have liked to have paid out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure though is just awesome... starting with the gray rubbery hair that's standing up on end... it makes me think of Doc Brown from the Back to the Future series. The head then is cool too with the safety glass/googles. Then you've got the chemical splashed lab coat he's wearing. Black hands for rubber gloves and the legs are alrighty with the black and white design, no print job.. but simplicity is winning out there as the rest is just an eye catcher. Finishing off the minifigure is his accessory of a flask filled with a green chemical. There's sure to be a lot that can be done with a minifigure like this and it's great for Collectors or those seeking MOCing purposes with this one.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,5,4

<p>Wow! so far this is one of my favs along with Hazmat!&nbsp; I loved that I got him with the Monster too.</p>
<p>Where to begin? Rubbery wild and crazy hair - pure awesome!&nbsp; Facial expression: CRA-ZY! The purple goggles accent his maniacle grin. The vial he holds has transparent green painted or dyed within to give the appearance of some weird concoction. The green splaters on his lab coat evidence of it's bubbly/fizzy nature (or maybe that's relish from the hot dog stand)</p>
<p>You simply cannot go wrong with this one.&nbsp; He and the punk-rocker were my first hopefulls before I knew of Hazmat</p>
<p>This figure would go well as an Arkham prisoner/escapee, another main character to the Alpha Team's Ogle nemesis, and of course with the monster (think of another use of the Anakin/Darth conversion set) :D</p>
<p>A happy surprise to anyone who&nbsp;gets this mini!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4

"8BrickMario","2015-10-05T16:07:36.507Z","I'm CRAZY about him!","<p>Appearing in Series 4 as a companion to The Monster, the Crazy Scientist looked unique and fun. Is he?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The orange Series 4 packaging is attractive and appropriate, since this is one of three spooky characters in the series.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this one are very useful. His hair is a recolor of Dr. Inferno&#39;s and is a soft rubber piece. The torso could be easily repurposed&nbsp;for other scientists. The flask is the most interesting part, as it has translucent bright green plastic molded in to show liquid inside.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>He&#39;s a very good mad scientist! His wild hair is perfect for the character, and his face is appropriately crazy. He has purple goggles and looks like he&#39;s laughing with insane glee. His torso shows a lab coat with green splats of his potion and a belt. The coat has some nice wrinkles in it, and the belt buckle is a nice metallic silver.&nbsp;His legs are black with a white hip joint, possibly in an effort to represent boots, but it&#39;s not convincing. His flask looks great, and really adds to the look.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this is a great character to add to your laboratory. Every Monster needs a creator, but he also works fine on his own. If you can find him, get him!</p>

"sideswinger","2021-04-01T22:40:47.637Z","Good for its time!","<p>The sixteenth and last figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Crazy Scientist. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top of the figure is that very wacky hair piece, and that has a fantastic design overall. I love the spiky tips, as well as the smooth sides, and the piece was actually new to the figure, which is fantastic. The colouring its caste in is great as well, being that light grey colour. And that&#39;s actually a pretty hard to find piece as well.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which is actually a bit creepy. I like his purple eyes, and that open-mouthed, evil grin kind of creeps me out, to be honest. It&#39;s a pretty unique face as well. He has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which looks good. It has some nice green splatters on it, and I love the button-up design. His black gloves are a nice little touch too. It kind of stinks that he has no back printing, though.</p>

<p>And his legs don&#39;t have anything real special going on. I would&#39;ve liked if it had more splatter printing, but oh well. It is cool how that top part is black and the bottom parts are black, though.</p>

<p>And lastly, he has a great accessory, which is just that potion bottle. It isn&#39;t anything too grand nowadays, but I think it was new for the figure. It looks pretty cool, with the conical bottom, and the green colouring to it looks fine as well. That piece has been used numerous times since, so it isn&#39;t too special nowadays, but it&#39;s still a great piece overall.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all for the figure! All in all, this figure is okay, in a good way. Not the bad &ldquo;okay&rdquo;, the good &ldquo;okay.&rdquo; He&#39;s just a classic scientist that really represents a classic crazy scientist. No, it isn&#39;t even close to being the best LEGO Scientist, specifically compared to the Series 14 Crazy Scientist, but for 2011, and with two new pieces, this is good for what it is. And that&#39;s it for the figure! Thanks for reading!</p>
