<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>I love the detail on the torso, both on the front and back. 
<li>Similarly, the legs also have nice print on them, with the same swimsuit pattern found in other female figs in previous series.&nbsp; Additionally, the yellow stands out nicely over the white. 
<li>I do like the face design, especially the added sparkles. 
<li>The ice skates are a cool new idea for foot gear, and offer decent balance for the figure. 
<li>The overall medium blue color scheme works. 
<li>This fig looks good standing on display.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The skirt, while an interesting design, does restrict leg movement.&nbsp; Considering that this fig is supposed to be a skilled ice skater, I find that this detracts from the playability of the fig. 
<li>I do not personally like the new&nbsp;hair piece.&nbsp; The bun and top details are okay, but the swish in the front is too large and looks a little unnatural.&nbsp; But maybe the ice skater was going for an outrageous look. 
<li>With the skates on, it becomes difficult to connect the fig to a plate, which makes it hard to incorporate it into a scene. 
<li>The yellow print is faded on the torso, at least for my fig. 
<li></li></ul>
<p>This certainly isn't the worst fig you could get out of a Series 4 bag, but I wouldn't say it's the best either.&nbsp; Yet it will still look good on display, and offers some good parts for custom female figs.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That it's an uncommon female minifigure gives it points right away, along with the detail work for her dress and sparkles on her face. The new accesories of skates and even the hair piece are good. The hardest part for me with this figure was getting the skirt on her for the dress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigure is well detailed and looks good. I'm just left feeling like, meh. It shouldn't, but she does.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,4
"bionic_force","2011-05-15T08:00:04.387Z","A great figure, with some great pieces.","<p>You just bought a minifigure without feeling around at the packet, but what could it possibly be, you break open the packet and pour the pieces onto the floor, you got the Ice Skater? But what's good and what's bad about it? </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Just like the rest of the Minifigures, bag, piece of paper with vague instructions, though in most cases that's all you need. However, this minifigure is a bit more difficult due to the skirt/dress bit, which I'll come back to later.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Every single part on the figure, excluding the stand, is a brand new design, exclusive to this figure. The hair is similair to that of the Kimono Girl and Sumo Wrestler, except in a bright-yellowish colour with a wave at the front, plus the bob at the back is slightly smaller. The new Ice Skate pieces also come with the Hockey player, and stay in place perfectly once attached to the feet, but have to be removed to fit the minifigure onto the stand. The torso has back printing, both sides dotted with an almost sparkly silver colour, along with some makeup of the same colour on her face.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Fairly obviouslly the main part of the set, because the set is a minifigure... When pieced together, the figure looks very well designed, with a lot of thought put into it, including having exposed skin by the shoulder of the yellow arm. A very impressive looking minifig.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Fairly obvious as to how you put most of the set together, but I gave this figure 4 star for building experience as it's more than you expect from a minifigure due to the skirt/dress/thing. If you need help, this is how you attach the skirt/dress/thing/cloth:</p>
<p>First, put the middle hole over the left leg, attached sideways on the legs. Then plonk both the&nbsp;other holes over the right leg and attach the legs to the torso to keep them secured.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Overall, like I said in the Minifigures category, the Ice Skater looks great and well designed. On the stand however, I find it annoying having to remove the skates, but I suppose that's the way the pieces were designed. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>All together, I would greatly recommend keeping an eye out for this, especially if you want some new pieces, as this contains seven/eight new pieces. I can easily imagine many uses for the skirt/dress/thing/cloth/whatever-it-is such as icicles etc.</p>
<p>Top Tip: If there's a minifigure in one line with a different amount of pieces to the rest, try feeling the pieces in the bag and counting them up until your sure it's the right one.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4
"sideswinger","2021-04-01T01:16:16.12Z","a good figure!","<p>The fifteenth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Ice Skater. This figure was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 8 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that side-swept hair piece which was actually new to the figure. I really love that design, with the bun in the back, and it&#39;s in a nice blonde colour too. I just really love that LEGO took the time to give this figure a completely new hair piece. It was unnecessary, but extremely welcome.</p>

<p>Next is her face print, which looks pretty nice. It isn&#39;t anything too amazing, but that&#39;s totally okay. I do like the little star on her cheek. That big smile, as well as the eyeshadow, looks great. She has no alternate expression, but that&#39;s alright.</p>

<p>Her torso is pretty darn sweet as well! I really love the shiny, glittery&nbsp;design for the stars sprinkled throughout her shirt, and one of my favourite details is how one arm is yellow and the other is blue. She has a bit of back torso printing as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually gonna discuss her skirt before the legs since it is technically the next piece of the figure. That cloth skirt looks good, with the very jagged points, and that design carries on to the back of her as well.</p>

<p>Next is her legs, which have a pretty good design, with all things considered. On top of her legs, we have some blue, which matches up perfectly with the skirt, and believe it or not, the yellow is all printing and the legs are caste in white. I do really love the yellow printing, and it&#39;s pretty complex for its time.</p>

<p>And finally, she has those ice skates attached to her feet look really nice. Those arts were not technically new to the figure, as they were also included in the Series 4 Hockey Player, but they were new to the series as a whole, being included in two of its figures, including this one. They really add a lot to the overall design of the figure, and it would be incomplete without them.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it for the figure! Overall, this is a very cool figure. She isn&#39;t necessarily one of my favourites in the series, but she&#39;s still a fantastic figure overall. The Soccer Player in this same series didn&#39;t at all say &ldquo;Soccer Player&rdquo; to me, but this figure actually screams Ice Skater to me, which is kind of hard to do. And as a whole, I do really love this figure, and maybe she is one of my favourites of the series, because after taking a close look at her, she really is a well done minifigure. Anyway, check out my profile as well as my other reviews, and thanks for reading!</p>
