I got 3 bags from series 4 on a shopping spree and the punk rocker was in one of them. Nice. He comes with a very cool rubbery hair-piece and the sweetest lego rock/metal guitar, the torso and legs are also very detailed. For once, I can honestly recommend that the build in itself is interesting - since it can be a bit disappointing to ""build"" the figures. It's just fun to watch all the details of the rocker slowly make a complete punker when it's finished and done. The face has a cool smirk too... got to like it.<div><br></div><div>Hopefully there will be future band-mates for this guy...</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Unique hair-piece and cool printing on the body.</li><li>Sweeeeeet guitar!</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>A bit pricey for just <i>one</i> figure, although it's a collectable...</li></ul><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"alva","2011-05-08T23:03:50.25Z","Cool Minifig","Think this is among the best minifigs that come in the Series 4. He has a new kind of hair. First I thought that the hair would be plastic, but after I got one, feels like rubber. He also come with a really cool guitar. And I love the small details that Lego put on the leg. They make the jeans look torn, by just printing a couple of lines there. Nicely done!<br><br>What I don't like about this minifig is the symbol on the shirt. I mean, a skeleton? And it's not a happy or cute skeleton minifig, it's a really scary skeleton with blood around the eyes sockets? Too scary man! If I have a child, I won't let him own this minifig. I think Lego should think better for the design. There's a lot of patterns that can still fit in with this Rock minifig without making it too dark or too scary. Maybe a text like 'ROCKSTAR', or a dragon pic, or a tribal pattern, peace symbol,....???<br><br>I think that's the only CON point from this minifig.<br>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,5
"AETerry","2011-05-01T12:53:49.11Z","Punk Rocker Review","<p>When I first saw pics of the Punk Rocker, I immediately thought of Guitar Hero, but it would be more appropriate to say Rockband as that's who LEGO made a liscense deal with for a video game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In either case, this minifigure is a perfect addition and piece for a Minifigure Collection and anyone who's played the LEGO Rockband. While there is a third party maker of custom made accessories who's made guitars for minifigures, this little Flying V Guitar makes the win for uniqueness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigure itself stands out great too with the new rubbery Mohawk hair piece, skull print for the torso and printing design of the legs with metal studded belt and torn &amp; resewn jeans look. He's easilly one of the best of the Minifigures out of Series 4.</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,5,5

The minifig is nice itself considering the torso and leg markings. All of them are clear and crisp.<br><br>though I noticed a difference in the weight and texture of this minifig, the whole batch for that matter. The feel is not quite the same as before...its also somewhat lighter. I have been collecting for over 25 years and there is definitely a difference. is it Mass production? or is it because its no longer made in denmark?&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3

"sideswinger","2020-11-11T21:46:42.627Z","One GREAT Minifigure!","<p>So the fourth figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Punk Rocker, and this is an incredible figure. It includes 6 pieces, retailed for three dollars, and was released back in 2011. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Going from top to bottom, we have that amazing pink mohawk hair piece, which is caste in pink. Don&#39;t quote me on this, but I think that was new for the figure. And as a whole, it comes out looking really great, with all the intricate moulding for all the spikes, and it covers up that stud on the head surprisingly well. I think it wa sa good choice to caste it in pink as well, because if you ask me, it looks swell.</p>

<p>Moving on, we have his face print, which is a piece I&#39;ve seen in several MOC&#39;s, and understandably so; we don&#39;t get singing expressions all too often. And this face just captures the emotion of the character very well, and all in all, I just love how that face came out. No alternate expression, which is to be expected for a 2011 figure.</p>

<p>Then we have another popular piece, which is the torso. I&#39;ve also seen this used outside the setting and in various MOC&#39;s. And once again, that&#39;s understandably so. I love that skull in the center, with those red and green flowers surrounding it, and I also like that LEGO chose to give him yellow arms, as that works really well, if you ask me. He has no back printing either.</p>

<p>And finishing off the structure of the figure, we have his legs, which have a decent bit of printing. And for some reason the picture here on Brickset for the character is a bit inaccurate, so you&#39;ll have to take my word for it, but there is some really nice belt printing on that connector piece for the legs. He has a bit of stitch printing on both legs as well.</p>

<p>And of course, the reason a lot of people are gonna want this figure is for that guitar, and for good reason, as that is a fantastic piece overall. I do love the moulding for the tuners, and the printing here is great. I love the silver strings, as well as those tuners on top. Overall, it&#39;s just a super interesting piece, and I really love how it turned out.</p>

<p>So there you go! That&#39;s the full look at the Series 4 Punk Rocker! As a whole, this is an incredible figure for 2011, and it&#39;s equally incredible for three dollars. So that&#39;s basically it for this review! Don&#39;t forget to check out my other LEGO CMF reviews, as well as my profile bio, and thanks for reading!</p>
