She just comes with a fan, I don`t realy know, whether tis is a new part or not, but I think this is a one.<br>The figure has nice printings on both sides of the torso, on the lower part of its body and on the hair piece.

"BrickManBrick","2011-03-30T15:45:49.767Z","First Kimino Gil Review","<p>So this is the Kimino Girl from Lego Minifgures Series 4. She is a pretty neat figure. Every peace is new, which is amaing! Each pack costs $2.99. There are 4 in each case. At the store you can feel for the big dress in the bag. It is easy because yhe piece is so bulky!</p>
<p>Parts</p>
<p>The parts are fantastic. Each one is new! The dress and torso have a new wonderful print! The hair is the sumo's hair with a flower print, which is a nice piece. The fan is also new and looks very great. I really the figure! This one is a favorite out of series 4!</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,5
"AETerry","2011-05-16T14:05:25.74Z","Kimono Girl Review","<p>On my last and final round to pick up series 4 minifigures, I was out looking for this one as my daughter expressed an interest in it from the little paper flyer or insert pictures with other Series 4 minifigures I've picked up. I'd encountered this minifigure before when feeling the packages as the bottom part for her dress is very distinctive and easy to pick out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So like any parent who loves their kid, I went back and looked deliberately this time for the Kimono Girl. I'll have to disappoint her I didn't find another Ice Skater... but that's okay. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated already, the bottom part for the dress is very distinctive and with the top torso part, it has a very lovely print design for a kimono. The hands are white as well as is the face. The hair piece is the same one as used for the Sumo Wrestler of Series 3, but has a flower print to it. Finishing out the character, she is holding a fan accessory, new for this figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now that I have the minifigure in hand, I can see some uses for her MOCs with the Samurai, Sumo and Ninja minifigures. If not an Oriental theme, perhaps on stage for some lego theatre goers in a Brick Production of Madame Butterfly or Sayonara.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,4

	I got this set for myself at Borders before it closed, and was rather happy that I got this fig because I had recently gotten to the part in Pokemon Gold Version where the Kimono Girls dance for Ho-Oh, and couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The decorations throughout are absolutely beautiful.</li>
	<li>
		The hair is also a nice piece.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		This is just me, but I wish that Lego would come up with a piece just a bit shorter than the one here for the skirt, as it is about 10 percent taller than a regular one.</li>
	<li>
		I like the white vampire skin, but not here.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This is an excellent set, well made and thoughtful. Well done, Lego! I recommend this, and for a challenge, make the Bell Tower from Pokemon Gold for the fun of it.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-11-15T01:10:50.487Z","Masterful Kimono Print","<p><strong>Set #8804 Kimono Girl:</strong> This is a minifigure from Series 4. I found her this time last year at a local con and bought it. Great price too only 5 dollars. LEGO CMF Series 4 was one that flew by so fast for me I never really managed to find many of them. Of the ones I&#39;ve gotten I&#39;m really thrilled that I finally have this character.</p>

<p>Kimono Girl uses a nicely printed sloped brick for her lower legs and includes a double-sided torso print with a very detailed looking design. The sash is particularly impressive. Taking the black hair piece first used with the Sumo Wrestler and adding some nice print on them this is a great re-use of parts. Painted with delicate makeup and using a serious expression the facial print looks beautiful.</p>

<p>We also got the new fan piece for an accessory. As I recall I believe this is the first use of this accessory.</p>

<p>Overall this minifigure is quite nicely detailed and an excellent looking character from Series 4. One of the more sought after I&#39;d wager, though hard to say as I haven&#39;t followed the secondary market too closely with these figures. I&#39;d strongly recommend trying to get one of her, perhaps even two, her printing is quite elegant and very versatile for MOC fans. Strongly recommended.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-09-03T21:40:24.177Z","The BEST in the Series!","<p>So the second figure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 4 is the Kimono Girl, and I really do love this figure. She was released in 2011, retailed for three dollars, and includes 6 pieces. So let&#39;s take a better look at her!</p>

<p>On top we have that black bun piece, and I love that part. It might even be my favorite part of the figure. It was introduced with the Series 3 Sumo Wrestler, so the piece itself was not new. However, this figure does have some exclusive printing on it, with the different colored flowers. And boy, I adore that design. It just looks so marvellous, and I think it is still exclusive&nbsp;to this very day.</p>

<p>Next we have her face print, which looks pretty good. I do think the white coloring is slightly strange, but I guess it is accurate to reality. I really like the sort of squinty eyes, as well as the tiny red lips, and I just love how it came out. No alternate facial expression, which is common with lots of CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Next up is her torso expression, and I also really like how that came out. I really adore that fairly complex printing from the black and gold belt, as well as the pretty white tree detail, and just as a whole, I love how it came out. But then she has back printing, which is pretty awesome. We didn&#39;t get back printing with old CMF&#39;s all too often. It was more common in Series 4 than it was in the first 3 series&#39;, but I still appreciate it very muchly. It is just that black robe detail carried on to the back too, if you were&nbsp;wondering.</p>

<p>And finishing off the body of the figure, we have that dress, which&nbsp;boy, the printing on that looks amazing as well. I love the red white and blue layering for that dress on the bottom, and she has some more of that white flowering design, which is very appreciated. No back dress printing, Which I do not expect. We didn&#39;t get back dress printing with that older dress design at all, so I&#39;m not mad about that.</p>

<p>Then finally, we have that accessory which is the fan. It was a new part for the figure too, which makes it even cooler. I really adore the intricate moulding on it, with the red ruffles, and I am just&nbsp;in love with this piece.</p>

<p>Overall, I really love this figure. You got amazing printing on every part of the figure, and you even get that new fan piece. If you read my previous-and only other-Series 4 review, which was the Lawn Gnome, you know that he was either my first or second favorite in the series, and I left the opponent a mystery. Well, this figure is the opponent. She makes a very compelling case against the gnome, with her awesome look and amazing pieces. If I had to pick, I would say this figure is probably my favorite in the series. And I think that wraps up this review! So check out my other CMF reviews, and thank you or reading!</p>
