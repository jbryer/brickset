Well I was part of the team that tested the game while it was developed, so I've built and played with it. It's a real cool game, where you steal gifts (2x2 bricks) from your fellow players. I remember having fun during the test. It's a set that has value because of the play value, and not because of the value of the bricks.</p><p>It's a limited release.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,4,3
