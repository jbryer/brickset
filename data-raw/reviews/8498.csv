<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Size 
<li>Easy build 
<li></li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can't be bought in the shops. 
<li>
<li>â€¦</li></ul>
<p>Fun and simple....if you are flying with the airline selling this set then pick it up.&nbsp; I am sure the kids will love it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
