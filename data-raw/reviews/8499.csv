At the most, I figured it would be a neat spare parts set.<br><br>It comes in an over-sized poly-bag with a good number of pieces for the price I paid. The build, i expected, to be quick and boring. In fact, it dragged on for at least 2 min. You can fit a photo in the inside, but I have yet to find one small enough. Nor do I want to cut one to enable it to fit in there. You remove some flat tiles, and place the photo there. The front cover is bigger than the back, and to me that looks very ugly. <br><br>For just $3 USD, you can't pass this up. It actually had some neat pieces and would be great to get multiples. This set is definitely not going to be worth a whole lot in the future, but it's nice to have something like this. Besides, who doesn't love a lego heart?<br><br>I say to throw one of these in with your next lego purchase. At the most, it could be something to build when your bored. Thanks for reading my review, and I would recommend this to a friend!<br><br>~legodude357<br><br>&nbsp;<br>",TRUE,3,4,2,1,3

assembling the set but was worth the effort. Picking the right size of picture

edges a few times.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /><o:p></o:p></span></p><p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

frame can stand by itself and that’s good, price wise it’s reasonable, if they could
put a picture measurement, it would help a lot on getting the right size image
on the frame. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">
