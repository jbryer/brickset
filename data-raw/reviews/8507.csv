<p>When you go to shop, notice something that you think is Surge 2.0 on the shelf, you find you do not notice Surge 2.0. You notice his canister (at least in most cases). This canister is very fiery. Flames are everywher, consuming everything while Surge is just standing there posing for the photo while destruction spreads - not very heroic. The back of the canister shows Surge combined with Nex into...a combiner model (Surex : /). Anyway, you most likely do not buy anything for the box.</p>
<h4>The parts</h4>
<p>Surge comes with an extraordinary amount of new parts. In fact, there are only two old parts: the Star Wars blue lightsaber piece and a beige pin. The armour is smooth, nothing like the one from last year. Sadly, the hero core and head aren't translucent. Oh, and speaking of the head, it's got a really goofy HUGE smile on it. The feet are also big and the four fingered hand is big and, frankly, sucks a lot. His weapon and headgear are very detailed, which makes for a nice contrast. Oh and he's got a &quot;personal&quot; armour piece.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Surge's build brings a whole new building style into buildable action figures. So this means that the build, short as it is is very nice and full of &quot;click&quot;'s of ball joints. Oh, and many of the pieces are attached with minifig-style pins.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>Overall Surge 2.0 is awesome. He's got great playability and looks magnificent. Although his weapon can't fire strait while in both hands, he's still great.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Can be combined with Nex </li>
    <li>SO MANY NEW PIECES</li>
    <li>&quot;smooth&quot; armour</li>
    <li>Good build</li>
    <li>Great playability</li>
    <li>Overall look</li>
    <li>Wonderful price</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Non-translucen Hero Core and head</li>
    <li>New hands suck</li>
    <li>Rifle can't be held straight</li>
    <li>Rifle is a bit short</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that's it, now stop wasting your time and go buy him, you won't regret it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,5

"icemon300","2011-04-29T22:27:28.51Z","Not bad at all","Well, this was my first Hero Factory, and I must say the old cliche: I was quite impressed. I got for about $10 US Dollars at a Walmart, and I can only think of 2 cons: The weapon Surge comes with doesn't shoot (though if it did, the projectile would get lost in an hour), and it's hard to elaborate on. The new armor system was impressive, though it will not go on Bionicles or earlier Hero Factory. The (second) best part was the thermo scope, which goes on <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">under </span>the helmet, and the best part... was the code under the box lid that allows you to play Surge's Creep Crushers game online. I would give the code, but each code can only be used once and cannot be used on multiple accounts on lego.com. <br>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5

The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The head, the arms, the hands, the legs and the feet can be moved. I really like the way how LEGO designed the gun and the armor for him. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great figure to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

I think I'll just do pros and cons this time around.<br><br>PRO: New blue coloring...At least, I think its new<br>PRO: Great Kopaka style headgear<br>PRO: Lightsaber blade in new color<br>PRO: Lots of good pieces<br><br>CON: Really bad poseability thanks to that sniper rifle<br>CON: White looks a little awkward<br>CON: Rifle is too short<br>CON: Armor looks too mismatched<br>CON: The code on the armor was really really faded.<br><br>OVERALL: This is not really a bad set, but isn't a great one either. If you already have two or three 2.0 heroes, there is no need to get this one. The new build for the 2.0 heroes is getting old too. SO I'm just gonna wait until 3.0 comes out. But Surge 2.0 does have very useful parts!<br>",TRUE,3,4,2,4,4

I always rate hero factory 2.0s 4 star rating in building, and I did for all except Surge. I normally rate 4-star cause they just aren't that big or fun to make. But with Surge 2.0, the gun was kind of a problem. It looks great for the pose of holding it to the ground and looking heroic, but not really for aiming. I had to use around 30 minutes of time and some spare parts to make it so he could aim with it.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Parts</div><div>The reason parts is a three is because of the gun, which I have already explained.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Playability</div><div>A 2.0 for me is usually a 5 for playability because of the flexibility, but the gun doesn't make it very playable.</div><div><br></div><div>I recommend this set to you if you have the pieces and patience to fix up his gun.</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
"Thismindofmine","2018-06-02T13:22:52.387Z","Good set.","<p>In my opinion the set is pretty good especially for the price at the time. I like the head gear that LEGO gave him and the weapon definitely&nbsp;fits his headgear. If you can find him for a good price I would definitely recommend getting him.</p>

"Curt1234","2020-06-25T02:06:40.67Z","An amazing set.","<p>I&#39;ve always disliked the 2.0 series, but needed Nex 2.0 for a moc. Recently, I opened my package that my parents bought for me, (Which was supposed to contain Nex 2.0)&nbsp;only to see Surge 2.0&#39;s canister. Obviously, with this not being what I wanted, was&nbsp;a little upset. My parents contacted the seller and worked out a deal. Pay for Surge 2.0, whilst the seller sends Nex 2.0 our way. This is a good offer, which my parents accept. Enough with the&nbsp;storytime, What are the pros and cons.<br />
<br />
Pros to buying this set:<br />
<br />
&mdash;&nbsp;Nice design.<br />
<br />
Surge 2.0 features a printed piece which enhances the set&#39;s overall looks. The set looks complete and overall, just nice to look at.<br />
<br />
&mdash; Amazing parts.<br />
<br />
Hero Factory is severely lacking in the colour blue. This set has tons of blue armour which is not only nice to look at in contrast to the green parts, but useful for moc-making.<br />
<br />
Cons to buying this set:<br />
<br />
&mdash; Very little playability.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know I can remove the weapon from being attached to Surge&#39;s right hand, but I prefer to play with my Hero Factory with every part attached where they should be.<br />
<br />
This set is overall very&nbsp;impressive, and has shaped my opinion on the entire 2.0 series. I know I can be tough on Lego sometimes, but this is what I feel shapes them into the amazing company we know.</p>
