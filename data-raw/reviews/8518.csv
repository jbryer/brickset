"deadtree103","2011-08-24T01:50:26.65Z","Could use some improving, but still a great set.","So I was at Wal-mart today and saw that they had some of the new HF sets(A Few Rocka's and Stringer's, plus one Furno, I didn't check the villians)So I decided to buy a Rocka, I ended up building him in the car while my Parents went into another store(Something I haven't done since I got Tarduk and Raanu a year or two ago)I built him straight out of the canister to avoid losing pieces, due to the 3.0s being much the same as the 2.0s, I didn't need the booklet.<div><br></div><div>The canister is what we've come to expect of HF, except with slightly different art and with all lime Lids, nothing new.</div><div><br></div><div>The Recolors and new parts are all very nice, and luckily the Helmet isn't as big as some reviews have made it out to be, it IS bigger than some of the other helmets, but not so much as to look bad(From the front and side at least). The new Duclaw pieces look great, as do the Large Paw-like piece and the new blades. And, speaking of the Paw thing, i tried it out as chest armor, and not only did it mostly cover the body, I can also see it working remarkable well for Female MOCs.</div><div><br></div><div>The Design is great, mostly, the arms could use some more armor(Something mostly of the 3.0 sets seem to suffer from :/ )and to an extent the color scheme is a bit jumbled(First time I've ever said that, heh). Some improvements could be made, like putting another plate on the left arm, and Possibly moving the weapon onto the arm itself and adding another hand(It would fix the armor problem of that arm and give us another Black hand :D ). Also, if you remove the large blades, the weapon can somewhat function as a hand :D !</div><div><br></div><div>But overall, it's a good set, and definitely worth the 10-11 dollars.</div><div><br></div><div>(_)DT103(_)</div>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
"Krataka15792","2011-08-21T01:11:18.03Z","Rocka 3.0: The Gold Hero With A Heart of White!","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello again! This is Krataka15792, a.k.a. Zok: Insane Math Wizard on BZPower, back with another Hero Factory review! Rocka 3.0 is the star of the Savage Planet wave, or I presume he is the star. After all, he has two sets of himself, and he is advertized like crazy on the TV box. This little kitty is ready to tango with the Doctor with his gold plating and claw of wonders, but is Rocka worth your cash, or should you send him back to the pound? Well, let's find out!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, I have to say this right away: Rocka 3.0's box art is just amazing. Rocka 3.0 stands before you in all his golden glamour, while behind him are the heads of the heroes Witch Doctor has slain, as the Witch Doctor stands at the very back of the background. It's both amazing and haunting. The same design is on Rocka XL's box, but with slightly different images. The top of canister, or hero pod, is lime green, to symbolize the jungle. On the back of the canister, you can see the combiner for Rocka and Stormer, and a brief picture story on Savage Planet, along with his Hero Core. The instructions are thorough, and I have had no problem with them.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rocka 3.0 has a bunch of gold pieces, so if you're a gold lover, this set may be for you. Rocka has gold feet, gold 5-length armor pieces, a gold ""fist"", a gold hero chest piece, and a golden helmet shaped like a lion. Rocka's helmet really does look like a lion, but its a little big for my taste. Rocka, along with every other hero in the 3.0 line, includes a trans-green piece which&nbsp;has his&nbsp;name and animal.&nbsp;Rocka also includes: Black 3-length armor pieces, grey lower-arm limbs, extended lower-limbs for legs,&nbsp;black fist, gunmetal chest piece, gunmetal claw piece exclusive to him and Stringer 3.0, Exo-Force armpieces, silver blades as included in Fangz, Waspix, Rocka XL and Nex 3.0, and white Hero Core and head.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rocka squished them by accident.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rocka's build is just the same as every other hero set, so I will not go into it. It's just simply an average humanoid build, centered around balljoints.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rocka 3.0 is actually not bad at all. He poses quite nicely, and the colorscheme actually works. Mind you that Rocka has a color scheme of black and gold, but also has grey, gunmetal, silver, trans-green and white mixed in there.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All-in-all, I must say, Rocka isn't that bad of a set. At first, I thought that the color scheme's would clash with eachother, but somehow it works. I would reccomend him to anyone who is a mocist and anyone who likes to collect. If you are looking for a more extravagant build, however, this set is not for you.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
