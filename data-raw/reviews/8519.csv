 has taken on the attributes of a saber toothed tiger, and he looks 
good! He comes with TWO orange hands, and a 2 blade tiger claw. He has 
many parts from Nex 2.0, but it's always good to have multiples. And the
 silver is a good replacement for the 2.0's white. I suggest this to 
ages 9 and up.</p></div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4

The play ability is good but you need other sets that match this one for it to be really fun. Over all it's a great set and I recommend it to any hero factory fan.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
