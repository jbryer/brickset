"Kalhiki","2011-07-18T09:58:51.663Z","Strength of a Rhino, but is the set equally as strong?","<p>Went to Toys R Us and picked up Stormer, and I must say this is one cool set. </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is a very eye-catching lime green with&nbsp;Stormer standing in the middle looking awesome. But what's even more awesome is the background with the jungle, some giant Venus Flytraps,&nbsp;and tons of Scorpios crawling around. The back includes a combiner with Rocka, a short (three panel) comic featuring a Hero getting upgraded and flown off to the planet&nbsp;Quatros (which is a cool picture showing off the planet&nbsp;cracking and breaking apart). And there's an actual size with the Hero Core (which only looks bigger because of the black outline).</p>
<p>The instructions are easy to follow as usual. There's some ads in the back for the Comic maker, the previously mentioned combiner this time&nbsp;showing you can get instructions online (though the picture of the instructions are from Rocka XL :P), and an ad for Hero Recon Team</p>
<p>Also to note, you get a Recon Team sticker and a code for the new Creep Crushers game on the lid.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>You don't get as many new&nbsp;parts this time as you did in the 2.0 wave. As a matter of fact, there are only two brand new molds in this set. As for recolors, you get size 3 (the smallest)&nbsp;armor pieces in white, and lower limb pieces in grey. You also get a printed Trans-greem 'nametag' piece. I like the design on it with the Rhino and Stormer 3.0 written on it. Very effective.</p>
<p>The new pieces include his 'paw'&nbsp;and the helmet. The paw is an amazing mold. I love the angular curves on it and I feel it's used&nbsp;great as a hand (I could even see it used as a chest piece as well).</p>
<p>The helmet is also very cool. Like all Hero&nbsp;helmets in this wave, it's based off an animal, this time being a Rhino. It's a&nbsp;very bulky design and has two horns obviously resembling a Rhino. But I also feel this helmet is the most generic of them all. The hints that&nbsp;it's a Rhino&nbsp;are very subtle, so this helmet could easily be used on a different character if you're a MoCist.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>none</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>If you have the 2.0 sets, there's not much new. Click together ball joints and slide rods together and you're done. However, if your just starting with the 3.0 line, then the build should be rather entertaining.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Despite a&nbsp;reused build and not many new parts, Preston has a look all his own. The placement for armor, and the overall bulky look are great. I especially like the use of the body under armor&nbsp;piece for shoulder armor. The weapon is also cool, even&nbsp;allowing the fingers to move so he can point and make a fist. Including the fingers, he has a total of 15 points of articulation for incredible fun. </p>
<p>Do I have any problems with the overall set? Not really. I would complain about him not having&nbsp;lower arm armor on&nbsp;his right arm, but that's taken care of with the weapon. And the lack of a right&nbsp;hand is also forgiven since his weapon kind of <em>is</em> his hand.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, I recommend this set. If you're new to Hero Factory and are just starting off with wave 3, then I highly recommend getting Stormer. If you've been around for the 2.0 wave, then Stormer isn't anything new, so he can be waited on. The overall set has no major&nbsp;problems in my opinion, but I feel he could use some new pieces. This however is easily forgotten once you see the completed set. He has so much charater, that new pieces aren't all that important. So overall:</p>
<p>5/5 Highly recommended.</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,5

"Krataka15792","2011-08-28T00:34:26.857Z","Alpha Team Leader with His Trusty Horn!","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, this is Krataka15792, a.k.a. Zok: Insane Math Wizard on BZPower, back with another Hero Factory Review. Stormer is back and whiter than ever, in order to defeat his former mentor Aldous Witch, a.k.a. Witch Doctor. Stormer 3.0 is based on the mighty Rhino with its large, robust horn, but is this guy worth the stampeding trip to your house? Let's find out!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stormer is featured with all his glory in the front of the canister, right in front of a bunch of Venus Fly Traps and giant Scorpio. He certainly knows how to keep a straight face in the face of danger. Other than that, the box is pretty much the same as very other Hero canister of the 3.0 line: Top is lime green, combiner model shown (w/ Rocka 3.0), Hero Core for size comparison, and short recap story. The instructions are thorough and to the point, and I have had no trouble with them at all.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stormer includes: White feet, three 3-length armor pieces, two 5-length armor pieces, white hand, grey lower-arm pieces, gunmetal and white chest plates, trans-green logo piece, Fire-Villain&nbsp; gunmetal piece, silver claw piece, gunmetal Exo-force arms, blue spikes, and rhino helmet. Other than that, he's the same generic hero. His white armor pieces are good for mocing, though. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stormer yelled at them to get out of his box. What a meanie.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The build is nothing really special to talk about. If you have owned a Hero Factory 2.0 or 3.0 set, you do know what to expect. A generic humanoid build. Nothing extraordinary.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Stormer 3.0 is smaller than his predecessor (by leg height), Stormer does not dissapoint. I am afraid to say that I am a Stormer Fan Boy of sorts, and I have grown on him. Of course, Stringer and Nex are better than him, these three musketeers of heroes will always have a place in me. If you haven't noticed, Stormer's weapon is the same as the rest: a Ice particle shooter. He seems to really love the cool. Also, I just like the Rhino head in general. He can have his own signature move when he impales someone in the chest with his horn of robot justification. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are a fan of Stormer, go ahead and get him. If you are a mocist looking for great parts, go ahead and get him. If you are a collector of recent lego sets, go ahead and get him. If you are a person looking for a&nbsp;very challenging build, get Witch Doctor. Stormer is too good for you anyway.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5

He's armored up everywhere, but it's not to much. With many of the other 3.0 sets (Furno, Rocka,ect.) they have a lot of places where there should be armor. Not on Stormer, and thats partially what gives him that bulky look, because he's a rhino. His head is a great head, but it should be elevated a little more above his body. His right paw is a nice paw, but wasn't very fond of it, where-as in the pictures, I thought the paw looked amazing. This is an over all great set. I recommend it to you all.",FALSE,5,4,4,5,5
