And then Ice gonna laugh.""  -Wyplash","<p>Wyplash is an AWESOME spinner, but the does NOT spin well.&nbsp; If your opponent has the card Endurance, don't use him.&nbsp; His card has: 400 Lightning, 400 Ice, 100 Fire, and 100 Earth.&nbsp; Battle cards include: Twister, 300 Lightning, if opponent touches it, they lose.&nbsp; Head Spin, 100 Fire, gold, opponent must spin on head until a player wins.&nbsp; Weapon Swap, 400 Lighning, swap a weapon with an opponent's weapon.&nbsp; Ice Shield, 400 Ice, build Ice shields on spinner until a player wins.&nbsp; The weapons are:&nbsp; Golden Heli-Chains, Groovy Whip, and a white bone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I recommend this set to skeleton fans... Ninja fans, not so much...</p>",TRUE,4,5,1,5,3

<p>Wyplash had great parts,and I gave him a 5 on playability because I bought him with three other spinners.Out of seventeen characters/sixteen sets,Wyplash was worth the money more than about 12 of the sets.This set,like all other spinners besides Kai DX,didn't really have a build to it.</p>
<p>In summary,Wyplash is a good set for most skeleton fans[like myself],and also ice fans[again,like myself].So,if you are one of those people,I suggest you buy Wyplash.</p>",TRUE,4,5,2,5,3
"Matroxide","2012-08-19T18:55:41.43Z","Great Skeleton Set!","Wyplash is a nice set with good weapons and cards. His golden helichains are the best to use since it grabs on to others and throws them off! Also his cards like twister and head spin are good to use. The optic spinner is realy cool and looks good when you spin it. Over all (taking into consideration the price) Whyplash is actualy worth buying.",FALSE,5,4,3,5,5
