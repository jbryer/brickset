<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Canister: It's shaped like the previous two waves of heroes, with that familiar lid&nbsp;-- but now in green only-- and same canister. It displays Stringer, staring at you with piercing yellow eyes. Furno and Stormer can be seen, sillhouette, in the backround. CGI, as is the norm now.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Parts: Sadly, there aren't that many new pieces. Most of them were first released in the last wave. There are&nbsp;three&nbsp;new pieces:&nbsp;Stringer's helmet, the claws,&nbsp;and the paw on his left arm. There are some recolours, though. They include&nbsp;the head, the core, the chest armour, the hand,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;translucent green name tag.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Building: If the 2.0 heroes are yours, then it's a fairly boring build. You snap the frame together, click on the basic armour, and slide in some additional parts. And it doesn't take too long. Meh.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Playability: He's actually quite posable. More so than most 2.0 sets, actually! He comes with the standard 13 points of articulation on his frame, but there are another 4 on his paw, bringing it to a grand total of 17 points of articulation. Thus, great playability. If you have additional 3,0 sets, you could have a battle!</p>
<p>&nbsp; Overall: It's a good set. I recommend it to collectors and MOCists. Or if you just like how it looks.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

"Kalhiki","2011-08-20T09:50:47.06Z","Does Stringer live up to his old self?","<p>I was originally going to get Nex, but since I got Stormer and I planned on getting Bulk, I thought I might as well complete the Alpha Team.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is, like all sets in this wave, a vibrant, eye-catching lime green. Stringer stands in a heroic pose with some glowing plants (possibly a fungus),&nbsp;Furno jumping from a Hero Craft, and Stormer in the background. The back features a&nbsp;Combiner with Nex along with the actual size Hero Core, and legal disclaimers.</p>
<p>Instructions feature the aforementioned combiner, an ad for Recon Team and the comic maker, and a picture of Bulk fighting Raw Jaw (not to mention the actual buildign steps).</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts, while few are new molds, are great. Since he's the first&nbsp;black Hero&nbsp;with the 2.0 build, you get some much needed recolors. These include&nbsp;the black feet, size 3 cladding,&nbsp; Hero Chest Plate, and Keetorange (or medium yellow, I think) Head and Core. As far as new molds, he has the large&nbsp;cladding piece used for his weapon (in black), &nbsp;curved claws (which I'll call talons), and the Helmet. The nametag is worth mentioning which is the same layout as the other nametags with the animal (this time a black bear) under the name of the Hero. Like always, the name is stylized&nbsp;with a somewhat wing like design. </p>
<p>The helmet is a very nice piece. It's designed with the appearance of having teeth, which is cool. It also has two bumps on the top which look very mechanical, but could also be pictured as ears. Finally, he has a very low brow which gives him a very stern look. The only bad part about this is that the eye holes don't quite line up with his eyes.</p>
<p>As for other details, he has some dents (think golf ball) on his forehead and back sides of the helmet which could be reminiscent of a speaker, which carries over his ""power"" of sound from his 1.0 form.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>none</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build was the same as last wave and every other Hero in this wave. That's the only reason I rated it a three. Otherwise, it still is an interesing design, and I'd like to see where Lego can take it.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Despite using the same build, the completed model looks fantastic. The black is so striking and really makes the Keetorange stand out and pop. Since he does use the same build we've seen, there isn't much to go over, but his weapon is worth looking at.</p>
<p>The Bear Claw (I always think of donuts when I say that) is wonderful. I love how the connection points are designed which causes the fingers to be angled giving it a more realistic movement. And since they're on hinges, he can grip, make a fist, point, and whatever else you can do with three fingers. the only part I don't like is the random spike on the back of the claw. I admit it, it&nbsp;would look <em>bare </em>(heh heh, get it, bare? 'Cuz, he's a bear? Nevermind...) without it, but something&nbsp;else probably&nbsp;would have looked better.</p>
<p>I do have some complaints, though.&nbsp;the design still suffers from the empty back, and this is more obvious since his under armor is a light color. And like I said before, the eyes of the head don't line up with the eye holes of the helmet. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary </h4>
<p>Overall, Stringer does not dissapoint. The figure is amazing, and I'm really glad I decided on him over Nex. The complaints I have can be overlooked, except for maybe his back, but if you have some extra parts, you could probably find a way to cover that up. So, I'd say definitely pick him up. Stringer has always been a fan favorite, and this new incarnation meets expectations.</p>
<p>5/5 highly recommended.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
