"KodakKid365","2011-08-21T12:18:43.973Z","Furno can fly! With sideways wings?","First of all, as the title says, how can he fly with wings on his side? That makes no sense. Buy what you can do is put them on his back, so it actually looks like wings. The box is amazing, it just looks great. The plasma bow is very cool. He would be a truly legendary set, if it weren't for the lack of armor. The top part of his legs are uncovered, and his arms hardly have any as well. He needs some more size 3s for armor. The lack of armor makes him look more of a bird of prey, though a hawk or an eagle are not prey, but very dangerous predators. I don't recommend this set to anybody, unless they use lego Pick a Brick Wall, and can get some extra parts for him.<br>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,3

"Peteyking64","2011-09-04T12:30:30.763Z","Not Bad at all","I might of had 1 Hero Factory robot and not a big fan of Hero Factory,but out of all I wouldn't say this is the best set of hero factory but I would say this is the best series of Hero Factory.Plus Furno is one of my favorite characters of Hero Factory along with Surge,Stormer,Bulk,and Evo.I do like animals like some of the animal powered hero's.And when I'm saying all of that I just mean Furno is my favorite 3.0 Hero Factory hero.Plus I love the parts like the hero core,the armor,the hawk headgear (a.k.a hh),the head,Almost every thing!And thanks for reading my review!Please check out my bricklists,my other reviews,my collection,sets I want,anything!Bye!",FALSE,4,5,4,5,5
"BulkFan98","2012-01-12T18:30:57.877Z","Furno's Best Upgrade","<p>I was at first looking in WalMart for Bulk 3.0, and couldn't find it. My mom saw this little guy and reccommended it. I bought it along with the Jay ZX booster pack (Wished it had a spinner) and a minifigure (turned out it was the Cavewoman). I'm glad I did.</p>
<p>On to the pros and cons!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Easy build.</p>
<p>Good color scheme.</p>
<p>Nice helmet.</p>
<p>Great weapon (doubles as daggars).</p>
<p>Eagle badge.</p>
<p>You can really make some epic MOCs with only a few pieces.</p>
<p>You can make some neat refitting stop-motions with the underaromor, chestplate, and Hero Core.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Hands look a bit strange from the top.</p>
<p>A cavity from the back (another red foot can get rid of that).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, a nice set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. For those of you who wonder, I'm still looking for Bulk.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

"Ultraace1022","2012-02-01T16:35:45.8Z","not a very good buy. alone.","building: the building is like any other of the new hero factory, and not a very challenging build<br><br>parts: it does not come with super nice pieces, but they're okay if you just need to complete the series, or if you need some more pieces.<br><br>playability: is high, as the have more joints and flexibility<br><br>value for money: i think this set is a little to much for a set that has so little<br><br>set: there is not much armor, so he is not well protected, and you can't do much with his pieces alone, but some of them are very useful, as i use the helmet and head all the time, and the blades are very useful also<br><br>overall, this set is an okay buy, but if you get another hero or villain with him, there are alot of possibilities<br>",TRUE,4,2,3,4,3
"legolover2001","2013-01-27T14:29:03.243Z","Eagle Furno ","<p>This is my first Hero Factory, and wow is it good!</p><p>The design is supposed to make Furno look like an eagle but the helmet is the only eagle like bit really.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice helmet.<br></li><li>Double dagger thing is pretty awesome.</li><li>Armour is good.<br></li></ul>

<p>Overall if you are looking for a challenging build like in some of the Hero Factory's cousins Bionicle then don't expect it but if you are looking for a nice playable or cool displayable figure then this is the one! &nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,4
