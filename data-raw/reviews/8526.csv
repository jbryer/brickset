&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello again! This is Krataka15792, a.k.a. Zok: Insane Math Wizard on BZPower, back with another Hero Factory review. I'm going to be honest here: I am terrified of bugs. Only the ones that actually can hurt you, like spiders, bees, wasps, mosquitos, all of&nbsp;these things, but Waspix is not like those pests. This yellow and black attacker will not attack unless you want him to, but is he worth taking home, or should you just whip out your bug spray? Well, let's find out!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all of the $12.99 villains, the box is of medium size. Each of the Savage Planet animals/villains, including Waspix, have an insignia of the Witch Doctor's skull. Waspix's box art features a Waspix (since there are many) with many other Waspix in the background. They appear to be flying out of vines with red spikes, which I presume is their nest. On the back, each villain features a picture story of the Savage Planet storyline, and the feature villain fighting against a hero. Waspix is seen fighting against Furno 3.0. The instruction booklet is thorough, and I have had no problem with them whatsoever.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people who are a fan of classic yellow are going to love this set. Waspix basically is a treasure chest of yellow,&nbsp;trans-yellow, black, grey,&nbsp;silver and red. Yes, trans-yellow. Waspix's wings are trans-yellow 8-lengthed armor pieces. Waspix's head is a very interesting piece. It certainly brings out the insect-likeness of Waspix, and is attach to a 5-length armor piece which has yellow and silver markings. Like a lot of the sets in this wave, Waspix includes a grey arm piece. I don't know what to say on whether or&nbsp;it clashes.&nbsp;His head is also included in the Scorpio set as a shade of green. Waspix's chest armor is a spikey piece which is included in all villain sets besides Witch Doctor. Another interesting piece is a piece that connects to Waspix's back, and has three ball joints. These are used for his lower arms.&nbsp;Waspix also includes: Red/black corrupt quaza spikes, Ben 10 claw pieces, Av-Matoran feet, and stingers which are in: Nex 3.0, Rocka 3.0, Fangz, and Rocka XL. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An exclusive Bee Keeper minifig was originally to be released with this set. Then, the Bee Keeper found out that it was based off&nbsp;wasps and not bees, he walked off.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waspix's build is basicly a hero-build, but with some added features. Waspix's legs use a chicken-leg design like Witch Doctor, and he has another set of arms which are connected by a piece connected to his back. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waspix is actually a really neat figure. He can maintain posture and can have unlimited posing possibilities. Waspix also has a stinger which is connect by the bottom balljoints on his torso near the thighs. Waspix's wings, in my opinion, can be hard to position from time to time. Although the design for wings are impressive, it still is quite hard to pose them. Waspix's lower arms are just for show, which have black spike pieces seen from the Atlantis sets of 2010, and the upper arms have stingers on them, connected on an armor piece which is the same as the head's armor piece. I really like how Matt Betteker (The designer for the villains) decided on Waspix's design. Actually I like how well he did all of the villains. I tip my hat to you, Matt. Waspix is also just a fun character toplay and display with. He reminds me of the golden years of Bionicle with the Nui-Rama.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waspix is one of those very special sets&nbsp;where there is so much to benefit from. Waspix is great for mocists because of his great color scheme, he is great for collectors because of his great&nbsp;design, and he is great for the kids because he is just that awesome to play with. If you are planning on getting all of the villains, make this guy first on your $12.99 list.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Rocka_3_0","2011-11-19T21:32:26.577Z","Waspinator's Cousin!","<p>I really like Waspix, he reminds me of Waspinator from Transformers, exept he's yellow, but if I get Scorpio I can make him green!&nbsp;Now&nbsp;to the review!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The&nbsp;boxart&nbsp;is awesome, lime green edges, Quaza Spikes everywere, and of course Waspix in an awesome pose! The instructions&nbsp;are fine,&nbsp;and on the back there is&nbsp;the Crazy Screaming Child.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The selection of part is a good one, for limbs! It's made up mostly of limb pieces!</p><p>But it comes with many awesome recolored pieces and 8 new pieces! My favorite of all the pieces are the wings, I just LOVE them! The color is so awesome! Very good for making a Trans colored hero of villain!</p>
<h4>The Build</h4><p>The build is very similar to the standard Hero, but with reverse jointed lags and 2 extra limbs.</p>
<h4>The Completed Model</h4><p>When you're done building him he just fits together, the head, arms, and armor just fit together! He is very cool and can do some awesome poses!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would recomend Waspix to Bionice, HF, and Bug fans of all ages!</p><p>This is a great set!</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-15T12:43:28.39Z","LEGO HERO Factory - Waspix Review","This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well. This figure is really easy to build and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The legs, the arms, the feet, the tail and the head can be moved and this figure is really easy to maneuver as well. I also like the way how LEGO made it possivle to give this figure two arms on each side.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"HeroFactoryDude316","2012-10-13T21:28:26.62Z","Here Comes Waspix!","<p>I picked up Waspix from Wal Mart last year and I'm finally reviewing him!<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box for Waspix is like most other boxed sets in this series. It's lime green and on the front, of course, is a picture of Waspix. On the sides its the same old thing just like all other boxes. On the top in a picture of Waspix's head and on the back is a picture of Waspix fighting Furno 3.0.
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts in this set are great. You get a ton of bones pieces and a nice amount of yellow armor pieces. You also get transparent yellow size 6 armor pieces for wings. There are also three printed armor pieces just for Waspix. You also get a piece which attaches to the back of a body which has two ball joints with a lot of articultain and one that can i=only be moved up and down.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>NO MINIFIGURES!<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>The build is just like any other build. Build skeleton. Put on armor. Attach extras. Put on head.
<h4>The completed model</h4>The completed model is very nice. It is tall and has a large amount of articulation. The model has a lot of playibility as well, but another figure allows for even more.
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this set is one of my favorites. A ton of articulation and playibility as well as a large amount of great parts. I highly recommend you to get this set. 5/5<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Curt1234","2020-06-01T13:45:29.27Z","The Scyther of Hero Factory","<p><strong>Waspix</strong> was always one of my favorite characters when rewatching Savage Planet. Something about it made me always want it. The head, claws, and Corrupted Quaza Spikes are definitely going on some MOCs. The head looks like a monster (Although it somewhat looks like a chameleon... A very angry Chameleon.)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s fairly safe to say that my Heroes should be looking up when trying to protect themselves, because&nbsp;<strong>Waspix</strong>&nbsp;is coming!</p>
