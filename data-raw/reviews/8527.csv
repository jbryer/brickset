<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box, like all the other packagings is a nice lime green color. Raw Jaw looks particularly menacing (and bulky) as he stands on a large techno-organic tree branch. In the background there are also some other Raw Jaws crawling around. The back of the box&nbsp;has him fighting Bulk 3.0, and beside that picture is a short comic depicting what all is going on.</p>
<p>The instructions are as usual and not really worth getting into. Besides, there are more important things that come in the box.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts in this set are actually pretty good. First of all you get a nice assortment of red bones and cladding. As for reused parts he comes with a size 5&nbsp;cladding piece with some excellent printing on it (mold has been used, but the printing is new). And he also comes with some red&nbsp;Ben 10 feet, which I like. I'm wanting to see this piece more widely used.</p>
<p>New pieces include the tusks, large red shells (don't know what to call these. same piece as Stringer's weapon), red paws, Quaza spike, those little black spikey pieces (on his hands and tail), and the head. Since the head can only be found in this set, I'll only go over it. It's a very detailed design, but I'm not really getting a gorilla vibe off of it. To me it looks more like a saber tooth cat with those big fangz (heh heh, see what I did there?... I guess it would be funnier if I was actually reviewing Fangz...)</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>none. Sadly. It would be fun to make Raw Jaw eat them.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build was rather simplistic. Despite not being humanoid in appearance, it still followed the same pattern. After all, animals are just humanoids on all fours. However, he does have some differences to set him apart. For instance, his back and head assembly. I guess you could include the arms just due to the bulk they have.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>I really do like this figure. He may be small, but he has a lot of&nbsp;heft to him. The added layer in the body&nbsp;makes him decently thick, and the arms just look like they could pound something to a pulp. Speaking of the arms, he has some nice fingers which are articulated for a number of poses. I also like the fact how he was given armor on his underside. Since it's really out of view, it doesn't seem necessary, but it's a good addition.</p>
<p>Now, of course, every set can't go by without problems. Let's start with the tail. Let's face it, this thing is dinky. Sure it's poseable, but it just looks thin in the middle and the cladding at the end makes it look weird. At least they tried to bulk it up with the black spikey piece.</p>
<p>My only other complaint would be his mouth. Yes his name is Raw-JAW, and yes, he does have a jaw that can open and close. But it's tiny. I would have liked some other mouth design that could bulk up that lower jaw.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, I highly recommend you pick this guy up. He may be a little short (shorter than a Hero even), but his bulk makes up for that. I feel he could easily take down a Hero. Raw Jaw is fun to play with and pose, and I don't think you'll be dissapointed if you pick him up.</p>
<p>5/5 highly recommended.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
