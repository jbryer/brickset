"Krataka15792","2011-08-14T12:57:51.947Z","The Doctor's Assisstant","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, this is Krataka15792, aka Zok:InsaneMathWizard on BZPower, coming at you with another Hero Factory Review. Fangz are the beasts that roam the planet Quatros, and they are loyal only to the Witch Doctor. Fangz are the upmost in ferocity, agility, and can chomp a hero until he's down on the floor. However, are you willing to take this puppy home with you today? Read on!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The box is your average medium-sized villain box. Like all of the villain boxes in this wave, Witch Doctor's face is plastered on the fron of the box, on the side, and even on the front page of the instruction booklet. Fangz is there in his prime, ready to pounce at any moment at you, because you will take him home with you! Behind him is the Jungle Landscape with two others of his kind behind him. Now, keep in mind that the Planet Quatros is a nature reserve, with many beasts on that planet other than bugs, apes, wolves and angry professors. The back of his box has the story of what is happening on Quatros and has Nex fighting this little puppy. The instructions are thourough and I have had no problem with them. One thing I found interesting is that part of the instructions at one point, labels the armor pieces by length, and by that I mean from sizes three to five. The sizes are revealed to you on the inside of each pieces and can go up to 8, I believe, with 3 being the shortest so far.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you were a fan of Jetbug's translucent pieces, you are going to love Fangz. Fangz comes with five translucent pieces, four of them being printed. Fangz comes with three corrupt quaza spikes,&nbsp; and a claw piece featured as part of the tais which was first featured on Nex and Rocka 3.0. Fangz also comes with two of these new shest spike pieces that are on all villain sets except Witch Doctor. Fangz also features two sets of feet (which I find odd), one first featured on the Piraka, and the other first featured on the Av-Matoran. This beast also coes with two rubber spears first featured on the 2.0 Heroes Stormer and Evo. But, the true start of the set is Fangz's head. I have to admit, it's a pretty cool head, which, intentionally or not, has an interesting play feature, which I will get to soon. 55 pieces make up this set.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientist minifigs came to the planet Quatros to study the beast. There were no survivors.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The build is nothing special. It took me a good 2 minutes to complete him. As part of his spine, an extra arm piece is attached to attach the Trans-pieces with quaza spikes. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fangz is a very interesting creature and set. He is a fine assortment of black and silver and gunmetal and red with a hint of trans-orange. He is very fine, but there is one thing I just don't get. His fangs. Fangz's fangs are so weirdly attached that you can even see the hand piece your supposed to attach it to If you take off his fangs, however, its much better and it makes way for an interesting play feature. Fangz's mouth is so wide that it can be used to bite hero's arms, as long as the part has no armor that is.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fangz is my least favorite of the villains I have so far, but he's not bad at all. He comes with great pieces for any mocist, and he is very, very, very adorable. I'm serious. just look at that face. Fangz is worth the buy, but you may want to get Waspix first. </p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Kalhiki","2011-08-21T10:04:28.973Z","Doc's pet dog","<p>Fangz is the only other villain set I'm getting (the other was Raw Jaw), so how does he&nbsp;hold up? &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is a little... odd. It has Fangz, but the pose he's in is just awkward. His body is&nbsp;facing right, but his head is facing left, making it a very strange looking position. Luckily, there are some nice views of some more Fangz (or whatever the plural is) jumping down from the trees. On the back Fangz is fighting off Nex 3.0 (or vise versa) along with the short comic showing the current story. I've also noticed that the Hero Factroy logo is nowhere to be seen. I like this as it clearly defines the villain sets.</p>
<p>The instructions are instructions. You can build the set with them. I don't have&nbsp;the booklet&nbsp;by my side, so I can't really tell you what's in the back. It can be a surprise.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts are decent. Most are recolors, and the only new molds are the Quaza Spikes, tail tip, the shoulder spikes, and the head. The Quaza Spikes are a very lovely, evil blend of black and translucent red. It's rubbery, but that can be excused. </p>
<p>The head is the only other new&nbsp;piece worth going over. It looks nice what with the ears and teeth, but I do have some problems with the design. First of all, he has an incredible lack of his namesake. He has no real fangs. He has some teeth, and from the side it definitely looks like he has fangs, but from the front, they look like buck teeth. This, in my opinion, ruins the threatening factor he should have.&nbsp;I'm not sure if I should really complain about this next point, but his mouth is always hanging open. If only they could have engineered two seperate pieces for the head so he could have a moving mouth.</p>
<p>As for other parts, he has some nice&nbsp;printed trans orange shells which look lovely. I do enjoy the metal plating look it has with the trans orange underneath.&nbsp;Another piece I feel should be mentioned is the back feet. They are older molds, and so they don't have the new sockets. If you aren't careful when you remove the ball from the socket, the socket will crack</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>none</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build was somewhat enjoyable. Mainly the body and head were the most interesting. I enjoyed making the back with the ball joints and spikes. The head&nbsp;was also pretty neat since it wasn't just putting a helmet on a head. But other than that, there really wasn't anything new or interesting.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The final produst does look pretty nice. The cladding pieces on the back make him look like he's hunched over and very predatory. I also like the tail which is much better than Raw Jaw's. The arms and legs, while simple, are quite effective in both function and appearance (though I'm not quite sure of the large shoulders). I've also heard people complain about the spears being a strange addition, but personally, I don't mind them. What I do particularly like about this figure are the eyes. Unlike most of the animals, Fangz has some eye color. Due to how the trans orange shell is positioned, from most angles, it shows through the eye holes giving Fangz some nice orange eyes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no set is perfect, and I do have some complaints. First of all,&nbsp;like I said, he has his buck teeth. I&nbsp;would have liked it if they actually gave him&nbsp;fangs. Second, is the body.&nbsp;From the side, he has&nbsp;several holes. Most of this is from the cladding not lining up, and in one particular spot there&nbsp;is a large gaping hole.&nbsp;But there is a way to fix this. Sadly, this fix does require the use of a piece not in the set. All I did was take a red&nbsp;2.0 hand and put it on the ball joint on his back. This decently&nbsp;fills the hole, but does limit the movement of the spikes.&nbsp;Maybe you can think of something else.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, I do recommend Fangz, but I feel he just isn't as good as my other beast, Raw Jaw. If you're interested in Fangz, I don't think you'll be dissapointed if you get him. But maybe you should pick up someone else first.</p>
<p>4.5/5 decently recommended to highly recommended. It all depends on your preferences.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"gnat2u","2012-01-14T10:32:42.733Z","No hero can get through Fangz!","<p>I got this set for my birthday yesterday, so I reveiwed as fast as I could.</p>
<h4>Box/instructions</h4>
<p>the box is pretty much like any other box. On the front,&nbsp;it has Fangz in a running pose. On the back it has Fangz fighting Nex and a really short comic strip. the instructions were easy to read; in the front it has how to enter your code, which I have yet to find, and in the back it has Furno fighting Waspix.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>It's parts are normal Hero Factory 2.0/3.0 joints, which is why I gave it a four. It has those awesome rubbery quaza spikes, rubbery spears like in stormer 2.0, and the head. The head has a ferocious look, but the mouth doesn't close, so it's not the best thing in the world. Now for the feet. the front ones have the new HF parts, but the backs ones still give off an earsplitting crack.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>none. He ate them all.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Pretty much the same as any other villan.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>He looks awesome when he's done. the tail could be better, but its not bad. he has armor on his stomach, but the sides look really bare.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>I would totally recomend getting this set. Its fun, its cool, and most of all, it looks awesome</p>
