His tail is stable, but quite movable at the same time, and the gun works out quite well. The legs are all quite nice, but its kind of hard to set him up good because you have to get all 8 legs in a good position. He has armor covering up almost every piece of his body, but not so that there's to much armor. He is a great set. One of the must buys for the 3.0 sets, along with Witch Doctor and Stormer 3.0.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
