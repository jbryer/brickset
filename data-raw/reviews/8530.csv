"RaptorPlunder","2011-07-15T15:05:09.893Z","The Shrine is EPIC!","I just got this at Legoland and I really wanted to get Kai DX. This set comes with cards which is unusual. The Shrine is great because it has space for storing all the weapons it comes with. It comes with the dragon sword of fire, a double scythe, flaming daggers and a chain. I like the way the scorpions hold the dragon sword of fire in it's place and the way Kai's spinner looks when it's spinning.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"earljr13","2011-07-23T12:30:09.47Z","the place to find kia dx cards","This kit has been spotted in New Hampshire's ToysRUs. The kit is the cheaper way to get the new sword of fire. This kit contains the second Kia DX with spinner. The weapons in this kit are double bladed axe, sword of fire, whip, and two tourches. The kia dx card has 500 fire points, 200 lightning points, 300 earth points, and 100 ice points. The 4 other cards are Weaponn Force (300 fire), Gold Rush (200 fire), Total Recall (400 fire), and Reckless (300 earth). This kit comes with a chest with gold bricks and a skeleton pin. This kit is considered a spinner kit. This kit doesnt really go with the story.

"GBP_Chris","2011-10-21T17:03:34.583Z","This is quality Ninjago","We all agree. Ten bucks is too much for one minifig, one spinner, a few parts and a couple cards. Even though the spinners may have metal in them, this is a LAME excuse to charge that much.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Solution? This set!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The best part of this set is that it includes one of the most powerful ninja, Kai with Dragon Gi. This set includes him, his spinner, three weapons, bricks, and cards. But this also includes a training structure and several other add-ons to it. For our dedicated AFOL builders, the build is great. It is exciting to see it come together. The parts are&nbsp;excellent, as I really enjoy the spinners. They are&nbsp;irresistibly&nbsp;fun. As for playability, unless you have someone to challenge, it's not very playable. The value for money is good. Since the set alone without the spinner add-ons would normally cost around $15, and the spinner add-ons would normally cost $10. Putting that together makes this set look like a good deal. I recommend buying it if you like the spinners but aren't so hot on the prices for the spinner alone.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"xccj","2011-09-12T18:17:16.407Z","Better Than A Spinner Pack","<p>If you're into the Ninjago theme, then you're probably aware of the spinner packs that contain a figure, a spinner, and some weapons and cards.&nbsp; Well, Mountain Shrine is like a spinner pack, but better.&nbsp; Much better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, this set has a ton of great pieces.&nbsp; Overall, it has 169 plus a few extras.&nbsp; It comes with Kai DX, who comes with some gold dragon printing on his uniform.&nbsp; It also comes with a classic skeleton in tan that's supposed to act as a testing dummy.&nbsp; There are also lots of weapons; the new firesword, a scythe, a chain, spinning blades, torches, and more.&nbsp; It also has some other rare elements, like the green flags, gold tiles,&nbsp;and red pistons.&nbsp; In addition to the Lego elements, 5 cards are included for the Ninjago card game.&nbsp; Overall, it has everything that a regular spinner pack contains, plus a ton of extra pieces.&nbsp; But while the basic spinner packs are $9.99, this set is only twice as expensive at $19.99.&nbsp; This alone makes it a much better deal... but wait there's more to say!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design of the temple is something to marvel at.&nbsp; I think it's a fabulous design, especially for a cheaper set.&nbsp; It uses a few pieces effectively and really gives off the oriental feel.&nbsp; I especially like the ornamental scorpions on the top of the tower.&nbsp; The triangular shape of the temple also comes out nicely, and the angles work towards the realism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set has some decent playability, but I wouldn't say that it's the best part of the set.&nbsp; The main focus is using Kai's spinner to knock down the skeleton dummy, and he can test out the various weapons as he trains.&nbsp; The spinning blade portion of the set also works nicely, although it's certainly not a highlight.&nbsp; The role playing aspect of the set would be improved if there was another ninja included to train with Kai, but as it is he'll just have to use the skeleton dummy as company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I think this is a great set, and certainly one of the better cheaper sets.&nbsp; The shrine managed to pull of a good oriental look, and it includes the weapons and spinner that represent the playability of the Ninjago theme.&nbsp; Plus, it's as good as the spinner packs, but contains far more pieces at a much better price.&nbsp; If you're looking for a good Ninjago set, I would easily recomend this set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"spykid27","2011-11-06T07:29:55.37Z","A set more for play then display","<p>So, this is a review of the mountain shrine. I got mine in singapore for s$(singapore dollar) 39.90, and it is okay, but lets go into the details:</p>
<p>minifigures:</p>
<p>kai DX is the so called 'main' minifig in this set, cos the skeleton dummy is just a tool for training. Its head is the normal kai head, a frowning man with a scar on his eye. As for his body, there is a golden dragon on his ninja robe, and on the bag of his robe, there is this lion\tiger head thingy which was supposed to be a badge or something on the original kai printed on his back and kai's name is also printed on it</p>
<p>As for the Skeleton dummy, there is nothing really out of the odinary, In fact, it is so 'lousy', that prehaps it can't be really called a minifig at all. The hands of the skeleton are conneted to its body through ball joints, with the ball stuck on the body, and the socket for the ball on the skeleton arm itself. Its hands can only assume a few poses, though. the skeleton can't be puut on the spinner.</p>
<p>The shrine:</p>
<p>in the centre of the shrine, there is this tower. Most probaly, that was the favourite part of that set, due to its creative use of parts, and its colour. The tower's red pillars create a striking contrast between the&nbsp;green&nbsp;roof, or tent cavnas thingy. The top of the tower is really well done, having quite some unusual parts (e.g. scorpions, exoforce amour plates) The wording inscribed on the white banners is '??',pronounced as 'bu qu', means not giving up or surrendering. As for the tower itself, it can turn 360 degrees,&nbsp;but I dont really see the use of that function, prehaps it is to give a dramatic effect to take out the treasure chest? Weapons included in this set includes a double-sided stickle and a&nbsp;chain/whip thingy. Lego released this set as a&nbsp;ninjago spinner set, with things included to help you train with your spinnr, But it dosent really help. All those punching bags drop easily, and it dosent really train you. The construction of the training apparatus is quite flimsly, and the pole suspending the punching bags come off easily. Their angle of elevation is adjustable, so as in to help with the training. About the other trainig device, which is a spinning saw thing,&nbsp;the way its built looks...&nbsp;well, werid! It was supposed to look like a saw stuck on a rock, but&nbsp;due to the use of random bricks that don't look alike at all,&nbsp;it ended up looking strange. Though it was supposed to be a spinning thingy, it dosen't spin well, as in the part that connects to the 'rock', due to the larger saw blades stuck to it. They are a&nbsp;little bit too big for the entire thing to spin properely. and one more thing, this rock can be attached to the shrine itself, due to the clever use of technich parts.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;parts used in this set is choosen very well, and so instead of just following the instructions, there are several different other building possibilities. The overall look of this set is awesome, and&nbsp;playing with this set&nbsp;could keep one busy for hours. Many ways to play with this set include: spinjutsu training, rebuilding, use it as a scene for a role play, and so on. In conclusion, this is a good set, and almost&nbsp;every ninja&nbsp;lover should have one in their collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"LegoMunchy88","2011-07-26T16:46:20.53Z","Great Way to Get the Sword....","<p>I really think this set is great. Lego 2254 Mountain Shrine is a small set and a great way to get the fire sword. It's either this of the highly overpriced Fire Fortress ($130). Although there is am downside: playability. You'll see why I still gave it a generous 3 for playability later....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigs</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kai DX: Obviously a great figure with some great weapons and a nice spinner. Not as good as te original ninjas, though. I compared Flying Ninja Fortress to Garmadon's Dark Fortress, and Flying Ninja Fortress will always remain my favorite set. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dummy Thing: I really love this guy. With some very uncommon skeleton bone pieces, and the overall look of it, it's great. And I was estatic to find that after being so bored of the new ""poseable"" skeleton bodies, they had brough the old body with the flailing arms back. Yay!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Set</strong></p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This set, as I stated before, is really great. I'm going to start with the main structure. I love how the torjii gate looks so great on top and how the pieces come to a point at the front. It's some really neat architecture. And a really good selection of weapons. You get the scythe, two torches, some kind of nunchuck thing, and the awesome Fire Sword. There is one thing I dont like, though: the little side thing on the 4x4. It's just pointless, It's one more thing for Kai's spinner to crash into when he's trying to knock over the dummy. Also, has anyone else noticed that when you go the hit the blade contraption, the only thing that happens is the the center spins around from being poorly attached? Maybe it's supposed to add to the set, but I just don't like it. I mean, I think everybody who has bought this set so far would have still bought it if it didn't have that little ugy 4x4.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overall</strong></p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, LEGO 2254 Mountain Shrine is a great way to get some awesome stuff for a small amount of money. And now, what everyone's been waiting for. Why, you ask, did I give this set a very generous 3 for playability? Because come on, people, you can spend 10 dollars more on a spinner pack for a guy to go with it. Is that really going to make that much of a dent in everyone's piggy bank? I bought the Sensei Wu (Black Robes) pack with the set, and it works great. Sensei Wu can come to test Kai by engaging him in a Ninjago battle. Overall, a really good set, and I like old LEGO, so this is saying a lot for me. One of the best thing's LEGO made in a long time, I think. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks, </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LegoMunchy88</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-09-21T09:34:16.8Z","LEGO Ninjago - Mountain Shrine Review","<p>This is a cool set to have and it's fun to play with as well.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 169 pieces and it is 20 USD. That means that the price per 
piece ratio is 12 cents per piece which is a really good value for what we get here.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs are very cool. We get a random skeleton which has a red stand and we also get Kai DX. The suit looks amazing and I also love the sword which we get for him. Kai also has some backprinting.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on.</p>

We get two weapons and some cool traps on the front. However I think there could have been a little bit more going on on the back.<br></p>

"Carnistir","2011-11-08T12:26:32.09Z","Awesome!","<p>This thing&nbsp;provides&nbsp;hours of fun.&nbsp; It costs 19.99 US, and is really cool.&nbsp; Onto the review...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box shows the set well except it has regular Kai's cards on it, not Kai DX cards, which are actually in the set.&nbsp; The instructions helped me build it, so they are fine. </p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Kai's sword is nice.&nbsp; The spinner is good, but, since I bought Nuckal's ATV, I already have one.&nbsp; The other weapons (a double scythe and a flail) are ok, except the flail throws you off sometimes...&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Kai DX is nice, because my older Kai DX's legs wobble.&nbsp; The skeleton is cool, and fun to knock over. </p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I'm not a huge fan of the builds, I'd rather have the completed model.&nbsp; But the build is ok.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Epic.&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; Kai DX spins well, the shrine features a punching bag and a mace ball for Kai to attack, and it stores the weapons!&nbsp; </p>

"whitesox1111","2011-12-21T16:44:34.257Z","An OK Set.","<p>&nbsp;Now when&nbsp;I bought this set I was suprised that there wasn't that much to it. I only bought it because it had Kai DX and that new sword of fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Box/Instructions</p>
<p>&nbsp;The box was a little to big for it because there isn't that many peices in it and the box was kinda big. But the instructions were easy to understand. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Parts</p>
<p>&nbsp;Well I hadn't seen these kinda parts before. They were poles that are red. That really surprised me. Also the rocks that were printed were really cool. The parts were my favorite part of this set even the spinner. I just like how it's gold and you can&nbsp;only get it in this set (unless off of eBay).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Minifigures</p>
<p>&nbsp;The minifigures were a good part too. Kai DX and&nbsp;Skelenton Dummy. The weapons fit Kai like the double slythce (sorry i don't know how to spell it) and these sort of nunchuck thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Complete Set</p>
<p>&nbsp;When i got done building it I was happy. Because after that I went to go build something else. Ninjago is my favorite theme so that's why i bought it. <em>It is good for the playability&nbsp;but still it's pretty good to practice spinjistzu.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Summary </em></p>
<p><em>This is a good set im kinda disapointed on how the building was but at least I have it finished. The battle cards are very powerful. Kai has very good weapons. And his spinner really surprised me. My next review will probably be The Fire Temple if not then a Hero Factory set.</em></p>",TRUE,4,5,2,4,2
"Blazing_Brick","2012-04-14T14:07:20.25Z","One of the best deals on the spinners","<p>This set is a spinner set,yet also a normal set.It was surprising to finally see it come out,because there already 2 DX ninjas released as spinners.It really counts as a training set,as that's what it's for.But it doesn't really help.Yeah,it gives you 3 unique weapons,powerful cards,a cool spinner,a cool minifig,but the rest is just to give the set better value.And the rest of the set did its job.</p>
<p>Kai DX is not exactly a new minifig,but the sword of fire is a new part.There's a holder for the sword at the top of the shrine made out of scorpions.There were good cards,too.Total Recall is a gold card with 400 Fire SP,and it concerns swapping weapons.Weapon Force makes you combine your weapons.Gold Rush isn't helpful at all.Reckless only on skeleton opponents and is the only Earth card include in this set.The other weapons were good:A Double Headed Scythe,and a very large whip-like weapon.The spinner is golden with the Fire Emblem displayed on the side edges,with flames behind it and around it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shrine has holders for all the weapons,and there's grass and rocks everywhere.This set is really good,and others say it's worth the money more than any other set.Personally,I think Garmadon is a better buy,but this is second to best!</p>
