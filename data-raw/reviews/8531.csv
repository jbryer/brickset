"Pyronaut","2012-01-19T09:50:21.443Z","Get this and garmadon","This is an awesome set,&nbsp;I got Garmadon a week or two before, and now I&nbsp;have all of Sensei's family! including Lloyd. Also, if you have both Garmadon and Sensei's Spinners, you can take out the screws and sort of rebuild them into a fused spinner, like their dad might have. or, if you have copies, and dragon spinners, you can customize them, too!",FALSE,5,5,2,5,3
"Blazing_Brick","2012-02-18T20:16:20.293Z","""There are Some Powers no man can Hope to Control,or Ever Dare try to use..."" - Sensei Wu","Sensei Wu is a good spinner because he has good cards and weapons.Power Build and Deflection were great cards.His spinner is optic,and he has on special black robes.All of his weapons are golden,giving him a high advantage.His golden chained fang is only good for spinning if the Sensei holds it with both hands.The Sensei spins very well,and you won't be disappointed if you buy him[except maybe for the price].Just for background,these are his good&nbsp;cards:Deflection;300 Ice SP;give up headgear to cancel opponent's card,then play it yourself.Power Build;300Earth SP;Build 2 bricks anywhere&nbsp;on your spinner;recommended that you place both of them directly next to Sensei Wu,it will keep him from falling off.",FALSE,4,5,3,5,3
"Matroxide","2012-08-11T13:20:12.893Z","Woo-Hoo Sensei Wu!","<p>This is the best spinner set&nbsp;I ever got! First the minifigure, Sensei Wu, is wearing a special Kimono that ""protects him from evil"" although he never wore it in the serise. Next is his great cards like Deflection, Power Build, and Meditate. The best way&nbsp;to use Power Build is if you&nbsp;lock&nbsp;the&nbsp;spinner&nbsp;by&nbsp;lining up the arrows and placing the 2x1 bricks infront and behind him. His weapons are all golden and are very&nbsp;good. This&nbsp;set also comes with a Clear Blue Optic Spinner with the&nbsp;creation sign&nbsp;on all four corners! Over all a great set for spinners!</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
