<p>LEGO Ninjago has been one of this years most successful LEGO Themes, probably because of the Story and the Spinners. Let's get to the review of this set:</p>
<h4>Box</h4>
<p>What I like about the Box is that it is not really a box like all the other LEGO Sets. It is very well designed and different. It actually shows the spinner, the cards, and you can kind of see the parts.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>It does not really come with any unique or useful pieces. Well, It doesn't really come with any pieces, it is just a minifigure, spinner, weapons,&nbsp;and some cards. The only pieces are 3 bright green parts.</p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4>
<p>It only comes with one Minifigure, and it's Lord Garmadon of course. He's got normal plain black legs, a skeleton like body, and a really evil looking face. His Helmet might be exclusive to this Minifigure, but I am not sure. He also has a new bone piece on his helmet.</p>
<h4>The Spinner</h4>
<p>The Spinner is purple with lots of ''Dark'' looking&nbsp;marks on it (my guess: they represent Garmadon). The Spinner is fun to play with,(sometimes have problems with it, but nothing major). You simply place the Minifigure in the middle of the Spinner and they spin and it will spin (pretty fast if you do it correctly). I only have one, but it will most likely be double the fun with 2 Spinners.</p>
<h4>Cards</h4>
<p>All Ninjago Spinners come with a Minifigure, a Spinner, and some parts, but something that I really found interesting is the fact that&nbsp;they also&nbsp;come with cards. It comes with 5 Cards: ''Double Trouble'',''Shadow Sphere'',''Finders Keepers'',''Card Freeze'',and Lord Garmadon's very own Card.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>Overall, not much really went into this set, I mean, $9.99, for a minifigure, 3 green parts, 1 Spinner, and a few cards? It should have been at least $6.99. But Besides that, it was still a nice set and I would recommend this to any Ninjago Fan out there.</p>

"Dragon_Master_48","2012-03-20T19:26:09.163Z","Feel the power of thunder in this spinner!","<p>This spinner includes the rather rare Lord Garmadon figure, and if you do not have it, this may be a good opportunity to purchase it.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sword and scythe are ""heavy duty"" weapons. 
<li>Golden bolt. 
<li>Lord Garmadon with Trans-purple spinner.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The lightning bolt ""tip"" is rather delicate, and sometimes falls off during spinner battles.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this spinner is a good value.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"Blazing_Brick","2012-02-17T13:22:00.867Z","Beware of the Evil Lord Garmadon","Garmadon is a very good spinner;he has good cards, a good weapon arsenal [second best only to Nuckal],and he is the only bad guy that spins and fights like the good guys.Garmadon has a skeleton like body,although I believe he is a zombie.His cards are are really fitting to his style.Card Freeze and Shadow Sphere make him sort of a cheater, and I like that about him.He sort of bends the rules.But,instead of him having 1200 SP, I think he and Sensei Wu should have had 1600 SP.Sensei's elements should have been balanced,but Garmadon should have had the following: 300 Fire,500 Lightning,500,Earth,300 Ice.His weapons are very good,I hold spinner tounaments with the other spinners,and Garmadon ususally places second,only to Zane DX.His spinner detail is amazing,and it's even optical! Garmadon is worth the money more than any other spinner set, so I highly recommend him to anyone.",FALSE,5,5,3,5,5
"Wreckagestudios","2017-08-20T17:35:19.627Z","Lord Garmadon Spinner-OK set.","<p>The Lord Garmadon spinner set is very good for its price. This is a good way to get Lord Garmadon as the other sets he comes in are all big and expensive. Like all the spinners, this is fun to play with. The one thing that I do not like is that the weapons are very easy to make without the set so if you want it for the weapons, just look through your own pieces. Overall, I think this set is OK; the minifigure is good, the pieces for the weapons are common and the spinner is fun to play with however they have made lots of other spinners just like it.&nbsp;</p>
