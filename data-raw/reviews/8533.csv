<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is&nbsp;like all of the Savage Planet figures; a very eye catching lime green. This box is also&nbsp;very cool on its own. Rocka is in a neat pose firing his Meteor Blaster (or whatever it's called) and Witch Doctor is standing in the background. But that's not what makes it cool. Rocka is in what appears to be a cave with tons of skulls (2.0 Hero heads) lining the walls and floor. In my opinion, this is pretty dark for Lego (but awesome nonetheless).</p>
<p>The back is the same a WD's box. It has the short comic and the bottom features Rocka fighting WD.</p>
<p>The instructions are nothing new. Building steps as usual. However in the back it has a nice picture of a battle between the Heroes and Villians of this wave (on the Hero Pad, I think it's called the Key Visuals Poster).</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Rocka has a nice selection of parts. He has some long bone pieces, and gold cladding. Also in the gold department is a gold ""paw"" piece, Hero chast plate, and his helmet. </p>
<p>The helmet is a very nice design. I feel it works better here than on the normal set since it's so big (then again, I don't have the small version, so I wouldn't know). My only complaint on the helmet is the face opening. Due to how it's designed, only the bottom part of the eyes are visible. But it otherwise looks good.</p>
<p>Then he has some spikes such as the infected Quaza spike in silver, and some stinger pieces (or whatever. Same piece as Waspix's stinger). And he has some of the large shells (same piece as Stringer's weapon), which look good in black, and some pieces that were also used as part of&nbsp;Bulk's weapons. Finally he has two of his nametag pieces, and a white hero Head and Core.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning (even though it's not new or interesting) is that he comes with an old style ball joint. I&nbsp;don't know, I just find it an interesting inclusion.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>none</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build was like Fire Lord's for the most part, however the back and shoulder assembly&nbsp;was rather different due to the spikes. Plus he also has a Hero chest, so it was&nbsp;different making the body. Nothing was really challenging either.</p>
<p>The reason why I rated it a four was because it was a recycled version of Fire Lord. I'd have liked to see something entirely new.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed model looks great. The idea of an extra large Hero was executed well with the design. Starting from the bottom, he has a very nice usage of the Hero under armor which gives the appearance of bulky ankle guards (I'm a sucker for large ankle guards), and he also has a silver Quaza spike on his heel giving him a nasty looking spur.</p>
<p>Unlike Fire Lord, Rocka has thigh armor which, while simple, is effective. The body is also pretty nice and is obviously that of a hero. I also find it interesting that he uses a paw piece as underarmor to connect the chest to the main body. Then he has all the spikes on his back which may not be very useful in a jungle environment, but still look cool and tribal.</p>
<p>The arms are... eh. They're thin, but They work I guess.</p>
<p>As for complaints,&nbsp;well, the little gold piece on his lower body is wobbly, and there's no way to fix this as far as I can tell. Also, the spikes on his&nbsp;""Freddy Krueger"" claw&nbsp;are rather loose and can easily fall off with a slight pull. However, putting small scraps of Kleenex in the holes should tighten it. </p>
<p>Finally, like Fire Lord, he has those dreaded arm supports. Immediatley after completing the build, I tore the supports apart and fashioned a quick fix. I currently don't have pictures, but once I do, I'll put them up on my Brickshelf. In the meantime, be creative.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, Rocka&nbsp;XL is still an awesome set. The problems are minor in my opinion (aside from the arm supports, but those can be fixed). If you liked Fire Lord, you'll probably like Rocka XL. Even if you hated FL, this set fixes some of the problems the design had (especially by adding a lot of bulk). So, I'd say pick him up if you're interested. If you're creative, I'm sure you'll find a way to fix the arm supports and make this set worth it.</p>
<p>Without fix: 4/5</p>
<p>With Fix: 5/5</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

It shows Rocka in all his glory, and the box is designed the same way as Witch Doctor's. I feel that Rocka on his box should be facing Witch Doctor on his box. the monsters from Witch Doctors box moving forward to attack Rocka, and the monsters on Rocka's box also moving forward to attack him. BIG problem for Rocka, seeing that he's no match for Witch Doctor himself, let alone an army of monsters. Rocka is not as big as he's set out to be, and hovers a little over Witch Doctors waist. Rocka's gun is nice, but seems to small and puny compared to Rocka's Claw. Rocka's has problems of its own. The claw looks epic in pictures, and is pretty much the reason I bought rocka. Now I wish I returned him. The claw pieces won't stop falling off. Another person who wrought a review on Rocka suggested putting small bits of Kleenex in the holes, which I have not tried, but seems like a great idea, and if you have already bout Rock, you should try doing it. Rockas legs are quite amazing, but much to bulkier then his upper body, just like most of the Titans. Witch Doctor isn't like that though. HIS arms are quite big. Rocka's body is okay, but his armor piece wiggles, and is to small. If you haven't already bought Rocka, save your money for Witch Doctor, or Raw-Jaw, or Stormer, but don't buy Rocka. He isn't all bad, but is a HUGE disappointment.",FALSE,3,4,5,4,3
"Dragon_Master_48","2012-06-01T22:49:23.583Z","Rocka... Well... Rocks!","<p>The Jungle theme of Hero Factory, in my opinion, is the theme with many of the best figures, including this one, an amazing nod back to BIONICLE, the legendary theme, predecessor of Hero Factory. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>While building it, I was reminded of the old BIONICLE Titan/Warrior sets.</li><li>Most of the set is proportional.</li><li>The claws/spikes and limbs can be posed in a variety of positions.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The head looks a bit too small. The large Mata Nui set also suffers from a similar problem...</li><li>The claws/spikes do not often stay where you want them too, especially if you move the set against a wall, or on a desk.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I am very pleased with this set, and I would recommend it to any LEGO fan.</p>",TRUE,4,3,5,4,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Just like every other Hero Factory 3.0 box, it's green. That's cool, though. Also, the instructions are very accurate and easy to follow, so a younger builder could build it without needing very much help.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>He has a very wide assortment of parts, like paws, spikes, axles and that kind of stuff. However, I do like how they get 2 name plates on. The parts are also very good for creating something of your own!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>What can I say? I guess that Rocka just doesn't need their help.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>VERY fun! VERY easy! It kinda made me feel like I was building the greatest hero in the universe. It was just so cool seeing him come together!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Well, he looks awesome, and he is, but just about everyone who has done a review on him has had one problem in common: The claws on his paw fall off. However, the solution is to put little bits of kleenex in the holes where his claws go. It works really well, and the kleenex bits come out from the sides, so don't worry.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all, he's awesome. Get him. Thanks for reading, I hope my review helps!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
