"blaksamu12","2011-07-25T19:28:59.217Z","Best of the 3.0 Series","<p>This guy is amazing.&nbsp; I'm not a&nbsp;big fan of Hero Factory (i liked Bionicle more),but when i saw this guy at the Lego Store, I just couldn't resist.&nbsp; He is HUGE and has a lot more pieces than all the other main Hero Factory villians.&nbsp; The Witch Doctor is about as tall as the 2008 Takanuva.&nbsp; He really looks like a mean threat to the Hero's this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was a lot longer than all the previous Hero Factory builds.&nbsp; It wasn't that hard, but took about an hour.&nbsp; You build the torso, then the legs, then the arms, then head, and lastly the spikes and weapons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weapons are pretty good.&nbsp; The launcher thing is pretty good, but the red ball it shoots falls out really easily.&nbsp; The staff is really cool looking, and uses the same head as the witch doctor's head.&nbsp; The staff is a little bit small, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though the Witch Doctor is huge, he moves pretty well.&nbsp; His legs move easily, but are kind of hard to pose.&nbsp; The arms move stiffly, since the end of the arm near the hand can't move around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>$30 USD&nbsp;for this guy is great.&nbsp; Usually, Bionicles and Heros had steep prices, but this guy has a good piece to price ratio of 1:1.&nbsp; Also, the size of the Witch Doctor makes the set seem like a $35 or $40 set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this set is really good.&nbsp; Its easily the best of the 3.0 line, and puts Von Nebula and Fire Lord to shame.&nbsp; I really recommend you get it, especially if you like Hero Factory.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Iro","2011-07-25T19:30:55.62Z","Witch Doctor","<p>I'm pretty sure this is one of the more anticipated Hero Factory sets - at least, it was mine. Finally picked this set up yesterday at a Toys R Us. <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The box art is surprisingly unflattering for the Witch Doctor. His head looks awkwardly posed, I think, and just doesn't do this set justice. The back, however, shows him in a much better pose in a fight scene with Rocka <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">XL</span>. His instructions are as easy to follow as any other sets', and also advertise Stormer 3.0 and Scorpio.<br>
<h4>Parts</h4>The Witch Doctor isn't stingy with the parts, having 331 for $30. This, I think, makes him one of the few Hero Factory or Bionicle sets that have a price-to-piece ratio of over 1:1. Which is a good thing.<br><br>Due to the last wave's overhaul of the building system, it can be expected that the summer sets don't have so many new parts. The Witch Doctor isn't an exception to that theory. His only new molds are the four marbled black/red Quaza spikes, two Raw-Jaw tusks, two skulls, and one of the two Hero claw parts in white (the one found in Nex 3.0 and Stringer 3.0).<br><br>As far as recolors go, the set is also somewhat lacking. There are nine <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/PL/92907.jpg?1"">Technic</a><font face=""Tahoma,Arial"" size=""2""><a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/PL/92907.jpg?1""><font face=""Tahoma,Arial"" size=""2"">, Axle and Pin Connector Perpendicular Split</font></a><font face=""Tahoma,Arial"" size=""2""> in light grey, seven <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/PL/90612.jpg?1"">small bone pieces</a> in red, and two Toa Mahri tubes in white.</font></font> That's actually it. The four white Ben 10 tails and the thirty-nine red ball joints have been in previous sets, though this is the first time I've seen them in actual figures.<br><br>Also, if you're dying to get your hands on some red Toa Mahri tubes, this set comes with a pair that aren't used in the model. The box art shows the Witch Doctor using the red in place of the white shown in the instructions, but hey, it's free parts, I suppose. The CGI also shows his skull connected to a white #3 shell, but the set doesn't come with one, unfortunately (I think it looks a lot better than the #5 shell, personally).<br><h4>The build</h4>What a build it is. It took me about half an hour with distractions to finish the set. I'm not one to care so much for the building aspect anymore, but I found the combination of Hero Factory and Technic pieces to come together very well. The legs are a bit repetitive once you've built one, but it's no big deal. I think this is the best figure Lego's churned out in a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">long</span> time. The ""titan"" sets were always my favorites from Bionicle, but I'd thought some (Hydraxon, Icarax, Axonn) were starting to become a bit dull, relying on the same formula as the canister sets. I'll assure you, the Witch Doctor follows no formula.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4>It's a damn cool model. It has its flaws (which I'll address in the Summary), but regardless, it looks undoubtedly awesome. I mean, it's a giant evil skeleton! What else could you ask for? The Witch Doctor does its job really well as it towers over pretty much every other Bionicle and Hero Factory set out there. Yes, this set's really freaking tall. Well over a foot, I'd estimate, from the feet to the head. It has no functions, minus the Thornax launcher, but I bought this set 'cause it was a giant evil skeleton, not 'cause I cared about gears and other such things.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4>This set's very well worth the money ($30 USD plus possible sales tax) you'd shell out for it. Even if you're one of those people who despise everything Hero Factory, the Witch Doctor has a great selection of parts (both Technic and Hero Factory) to use for your subjectively superior MOC's.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pros:</span><br>-Price is reasonable<br>-Parts are good and very useful<br>-Aesthetically awesome<br>-Build is decent enough<br>-Two free red Toa Mahri tubes<br>-Cons are easy fixes, haha<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cons:<br></span>-There's a lot of grey, both dark and light, unfortunately<br>-Bits of silver seem out of place<br>-#5 shell used to attach skull to neck<br>-Lower part of the staff is dinky<br>-Right hand is noticeably way too small<br>-The back and sides of the torso are very skinny and empty<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Kalhiki","2011-07-31T17:19:07.697Z","Perfect score for an amazing set.","<p>The big baddie for this year is (The) Witch Doctor (or as I like to call him ""Doc""). I really don't know where to begin on this guy. Let's just say he's loads better than Fire Lord (and I personally loved Fire Lord).</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The Box is big. It has a lovely (edited) picture of Doc standing, looking menacing, and being everything a villain should be. Behind him are his Infected Quaza implanted animals (including a yellow Raw-Jaw. How dare you taunt us, Lego) who also look menacing.</p>
<p>The back features Doc fighting Extra Large sized Rocka in the jungle. Above them is a short comic (somewhat) detailing the events happening (Doc is causing trouble, Heroes are upgraded, and flown off to Quatros). </p>
<p>Instuctions are instruction, and since the completed figure is better than a bunch of paper, I'm not going to focus on them much. Let's just say you can easily build Doc with them.</p>
<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>
<p>Doc comes with a good deal of good parts. As for new parts he has the very evil looking Quaza Spikes, the very evil looking face, and the not so evil looking spikes on his gun (the same pieces for Raw-Jaw's tusks and Furno's wings), and his chest piece (also used as Nex 3.0's weapon) in white. The head is the only real piece exclusive to the set which serves it's purpose as being a skull. It has teeth and eyebrows and whatnot. Sadly, it can't fit onto a Hero Head.</p>
<p>As for interesting pieces, he has his back spikes (which I'm pretty sure were used in the Ben 10 line as tails), some long black bones which are nice to have for Mocists, and all these red ball joints. I was going to check the instructions on how many he has, but I forgot. Let's just say, a lot.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>none. Doc would crush them anyway.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>For those of you who like the new Hero Factory build may be dissapointed to find Doc has a lot of Technic parts. Really, on a figure this big, I couldn't see how they could avoid it. Luckily only the body is Technic based, and the rest is the new Bulding&nbsp;Style (I'll call it BARBS (Ball And Rod Building System).</p>
<p>As for difficulty, I can't really say. The instructions are easy to follow, so I&nbsp;had no problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>My goodness, this guy is massive.&nbsp;I paid 30 bucks, and it was definitely worth it. This guy just looks like he could tear Heroes apart. As for pose-ability he's pretty good. They designed a system of ball joints that provide an in and out, forward and back movement. This is used on the ankles, hips, and shoulders. However, this does mark down on looks when he's posed. For instance, he has no upper leg swivel which causes his legs to look rather rigid. But this is a minor gripe. He also has no real knee. Instead,&nbsp;he has these weird ""chicken legs"" which have a regular knee and and a second forward facing joint before the foot. This second joint bends freely while the knee remains static. Once again, though, minor gripe. Otherwise, pose-ability is fine.</p>
<p>As for anything else to point out, his weapons are cool. He has the meteor blaster which has spikes on the back. I guess these spikes could also be used as a claw as well. Then there's his Skull Scepter (I refuse to call it a staff. Staffs are longer). It's a neat design, but I would have maybe prefered a different color on the skull since it's exactly the same as the one used for Doc's head. </p>
<p>Speaking of his head, he has no eyes. He has eye holes, but no color. This is my biggest complaint, and there really is no way to fix this. But it does open up possibilities to use LED Lights. Hmmm....</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, this is a fantastic set and a must have. The BARBS is incorporated enough to fit into the HF&nbsp;line, and the Technic parts provide a solid structure. He's got great pose-ability which provides tons of fun. Plus, he towers over Heroes, so size-wise he's definitely worth your money. I highly advise you to pick him up once you see him.</p>
<p>6/5 Stupendously Recommended (and yes, I can do that.)</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Krataka15792","2011-08-13T01:05:40.41Z","I Told The Witch Doctor I Was In Love With Him!","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Krataka15792, aka Zok: Insane Math Wizard on BZPower, and this is my first HF review.Witch Doctor is the main villain for the 3.0 line. He is the villain in white, red and black, but is he worth the bang for your buck? Read on and find out.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First things first, this box is massive. The front features Witch Doctor in all his glory with a swarm of all his corrupt animals just aching to rip you apart. On the back of the box, the story of the Hero Factory 3.0 line is shown. Witch Doctor (as Aldous Witch)&nbsp;sends a distress signal to Hero Factory as part of a plan to trap the heroes. The Heroes are upgraded with animal-like armor and weapons, and are sent to the planet Quatros, a nature reserve,&nbsp;which is dying because of its Quaza-loss. Witch Doctor was using the planet's quaza to corrupt the beasts of Quatros in his plan to kill all the heroes. Witch Doctor is then seen battling Rocka XL, which I don't have. One interesting fact about Witch Doctor and his animal minions is that his face, which is a skull, is plastered all over the boxes as sort of a logo. The instructions are thorough and I had no problem going through them.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witch Doctor comes with a wide array of parts, which will make any Mocist proud. His skull piece is fantastic, and he comes with four Ben 10 tails. He comes with four corrupt quaza spikes, and five of the 2.0 shield pieces. He also comes with one of the new claw pieces that come with Stringer 3.0 and Nex 3.0, and that acts as part of his chest armor. He also comes with four Mahri tubes, two which are red, and two that are white. However, in the instructions, you use only the white ones as part of the torso. The red tubes are to represent Witch Doctor using his quaza powers on the animals, as seen from the box. Also, if you are a fan of ball joints, you are in for a treat. Witch Doctor comes with 39 red ball joints, which are the most pieces in the set. There are no leftover ball joints for this set, so that means that they were all used well. A total of 331 pieces make up this set.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No minifigures whatsoever in this set. I presume that Witch Doctor destroyed them.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never owned the Hero Craft which was released last year, but I would presume that this set is more complex than that. Witch Doctor took me more than an hour and a half to build him, and he has a good building experience. He truly brings a drawback to those days of Bionicle that were so great. It is Bionicle's 10th anniversary, so I would presume that nostalgia must be in place in this wave. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witch Doctor is a massive set, who is almost as tall as his box. He has&nbsp;31 points of articulation (If I'm correct), and he is just great. He looks like someone who would just rip you limb from limb. He comes with a meteor blaster, and a quaza staff which is very small. Witch Doctor has no eyes, and his arms lack armor in some places, but those are the only flaws present. Everything else is just perfect. Let's not forget that he is very fun to play with.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, If you are looking for a set which is complex, but still is fun to play with, this is the set for you. Great pieces, great figure, great set all-in-all. I would highly reccomend him.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

It shows Witch Doctor, with this look as if he's leading an army that could take on the world. All of the beasts are joining behind him, obviously at his command, and seem to be charging a very unlucky hero, who is probably surrounded from behind as well. Witch Doctor is bigger then the Titan Takanuvah, and bigger then the Titan Matanui. He is the biggest set I have ever seen, and by far the best. With the white pieces that are Ben 10 tails on his back, he looks epic. There were only two things he was missing. His staff is much smaller then it looks and should be, which can be easily fixed, and he isn't wearing his shirt that says ""I step on heroes like its my job"", which he could easily do, seeing that a tall hero doesn't even reach his waist. He out matches Rocka XL in every way, and will be sending Rocka XL and all the other heroes hiding in there little Hero Pods in seconds. Rocka XL hardly stands above his waist. He comes with two red tubes and two white tubes. On the box, it shows the red tubes on his back, but in the instructions, it instructs you to put the white tubes on his back, so the red tubes make great extra parts for you to chose where they will go on his body, and the usual extra smaller pieces that will someday be useful. I only recommend him to experienced builders. It took me about a half hour to build him, and I usually build normal heros in 40 seconds, and normal sized bad guys in 2 minutes and twenty seconds. Von nebula and Witch Doctor are the only that i have found hard, but above all is the final question. Is he worth $30. Well, the answer came very quickly to me. Yes! He is the best set ever.

Well, only if you make him do that, because your story of him could be anything! I just bought him at the LEGO store, and here is my review!</div>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>Ah, a nice refreshing green, with Witch Doctor on the front controlling his army of quaza corrupted beasts... Could it get any cooler? Also, the instructions are easy to follow, and they never left me confused!</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>LEGO's design for 2.0-3.0 Parts is truly amazing, because the original parts always broke, and I literally mean CRACKED, but these new ones have a practically <i>flawless</i>&nbsp;design! And I can NEVER forget about the extra parts! The red tubes that you get look so cool, and you can switch them out with the white tubes, TOO! I guess LEGO just didn't know if they were supposed to use red or white.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I'm gonna have to guess that they all ate their way out of the boxes before someone made them go home and live with Witch Doctor!</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It took me a little while to build, but I get that because of the fact that it is made of 331 Hero Factory Parts!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The Flexibility of the HUGE model is INCREDIBLE! Never before had I imagined that a model so BIG could move so much! Plus, Rocka XL, who I also have, stands up to Witch Doctor's neck, which makes them awesome opponents in battle!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px; "">He. Is. AWESOME! I totally recommend him for anyone interested in the HF villains! Great work, LEGO. 5 stars.</span></h4>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

It was a rip off for the price but still it was fun to use. I have every Hero Factory set for the third series. He was a big part. And the thing i didn't like was he didn't have a head only a mask. He had slot of confusing peceices. They looked alot alike otherwise he is avery cool set my favorite Hero Factory.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,2

"KSTLRM","2012-08-17T15:19:56.257Z","Was never in to Bionicle or Hero Factory... till I saw the Witch Doctor","<p>Very big LEGO fan, love building sets, etc... never got the whole Bionicle thing.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;was clicking around some adds, I saw this guy and decided I might give the Hero Factory a try... looked around for a few I liked.&nbsp; Got the Black Phantom about a week or so ago, thought he was REALLY cool, but the Witch Doctor blows him away!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build is pretty time consuming, but not difficult for a teenager +</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was a little disappointed at his flexibility, the smaller Hero Factory guys can get in some pretty cool position and still balance... Witch Doctor is limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, I'm VERY happy with the set and gotta say he looks pretty bad a**... I was hoping he would have a neon type insert for his head like the Black Phantom does (his eyes look yellow), the Witch Doctors are red if you look at just the right angle (a red circular piece holds the head on)... but, still, the best character of the set!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall Rating: 5 bricks!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
