<p>the Skull Truck is what I call the Mobile HQ of the Skeletons. It has enough room to fill it with all the skeletons in one way or another. Compared to Garmaddon's Fort the Skull Truck is much more impressive in the skeleton army. </p>
<p>.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Krunch Munch - Ride effect is very well build and executed 
<li>The grab hand launcher works fine and is good for knocking out Ninja's. 
<li></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The fire parts on the eninges fall out to easily. Minor issue though. 
<li></li></ul>
<p>At the European Euro prize of 60+ euro it is to expensive. But searching on the net is rewarding and you can get it at 40 euro allready.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all a highly playable set and a fun build.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"cojack","2012-03-27T16:32:20.57Z","Skull truck whoops butt","My son received this set as a gift, and i didnt think it was all that great until i started putting it together, the suspension is great, the skull on the front of the truck is super cool, and there are lots of neat little details i like about it. This is one of the funnest builds i've done since my son and i got into lego a few months ago, and the suspension makes it super playable(and shock absorbant). Ninjago stuff is pulling me in.<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Katherine","2017-06-30T16:43:32.67Z","The Skull Truck","<p><strong>Overall Rating: (4/5)</strong></p>

<p>My overall rating for this set would be a&nbsp;<strong>4/5</strong>&nbsp;because the Skull Truck is a durable, large model that contains many play features and an interesting build. Some highlights include the suspension (the set even uses springs), the mouth-chomping action, and the prison pods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: (4/5)</strong></p>

<p>The Skull Truck was a more difficult model to build because of all the technic pieces that make it sturdy. Although it&#39;s nice to be challenged occasionally, I do remember becoming frustrated with the instruction manuals a couple times--I don&#39;t remember if it was because the pictures had poor resolution or if they simply weren&#39;t clear. Aside from that center section though, it was mostly enjoyable to build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts: (4/5)</strong></p>

<p>The parts for this set were quite good. Not stellar but not necessarily common either. I liked the rubber tire pieces and bone style pieces in particular.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability: (5/5)</strong></p>

<p>Playability for this model is exceptional. Younger kids will really enjoy the suspension, action features, prisons, and minifigures. Although, the &quot;launching hand&quot; in the rear of the vehicle isn&#39;t that great. Maybe there&#39;s playability there for who can get it to work the best.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money: (4/5)</strong></p>

<p>This set recieves a&nbsp;<strong>4/5</strong>&nbsp;in terms of value for money because I feel like the end result is appropriate for younger fans but the building process is suitable for more experienced, older kids. However, I do think the retail price of $60 USD is reasonable.</p>

"Mr_Greenleaf","2017-08-18T22:33:55.293Z","Lego Ninjago 2011 Skull Truck.","<p>So I picked up the Ninjago&nbsp;Skull Truck back in 2015, when it was on clearance in Tesco for &pound;40 so I will look at it objectively from a point of view from when it came out in 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the Skull Truck, being the main &quot;bad guy&quot; vehicle of the original wave of Ninjago&nbsp;sets was obviously a very valuable set to acquire with a good amount of important minifigs; being lord garmadon, zane, jay and wyplash. The build is relatively simple but with some interesting techniques in the front and back suspension. All in all, you get a good amount for your money, with the retail price being &pound;44.99, and a lot of play value. I would rate it a solid 7/10.</p>

"Andy317","2018-06-04T16:23:04.187Z","Extremely Playable for the Kiddies","<p>This set was one of the ones I remember having the most fun with as a kid. It includes a cheap way (back in 2011 at least) to get Garmadon, who is the most desirable Minifigure in the line. In terms of play functions, it has spring suspension and little cages to capture the ninja in, as well as a skull mouth that closes up and down. My only two complaints would be that it looks a bit too chunky and it should&rsquo;ve probably retailed for 50 bucks, not 60. Don&rsquo;t pay more than $75 for it on eBay secondhand.&nbsp;</p>
