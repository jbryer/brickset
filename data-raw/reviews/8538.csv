Like this a lot because this is a different dragon as compared to the winged dragons from the other Ninjago sets. So on with the review.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>For those who will be ordering and need to know the package size it is 14.9 x 10.2 x 2.2 inches. It came with 3 polybags plus the dragon head from a separate plastic and 1 instruction booklet. The bags are numbered except the head. Bag 1 has the 2 minifigs and accessories and parts for the hind body. Bag 2 makes the legs and front body and Bag 3 for the tail, scales and head part. Instructions is fairly straightforward in the assembly.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>It has 227 pieces plus 2 extras (1 skeleton arm and 1 black stud) which I find kind of disappointing that it has no fair amount of extra pieces. Mostly it is on the brown shade with black and gray and green accent as seen in the pictures. I like the dragon head made of 2 parts (head and jaw) interlinked by and technic/bionicle tongue that holds the earth ball. This when you press the head and jaw it spits out the ball. Nice. The head is made of rubber with 3 holes on the top for the horns. Except the horns are only 2 since the one left on the front is free so you can press the head for the spitting ball.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>2 figs. Cole (black ninja) and wyplash (skeleton with brown hat) Cole has the katana while wyplash has the saber sword. The golden scythe is guarded by the earth dragon together with the gray boulder with gems. Actually the blade of the scythe can be placed on the remaining hole on the head of the dragon to make it 3 horns. (1 golden and 2 gray)<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>As mentioned in the parts, it is straightforward based on the bags, which for me is kinda easy since I dont have to look on different bags for the parts. Anyway, I like very much the way it stands since you can pose it either arched up or lying flat near the floor. The 2 front legs are very movable but the hind legs are relatively fixed except posing the feet. You can also somewhat rotate the section joining the front and hind body part to sort of twist the pose of the dragon. The Head is also fairly movable. I like the best is the whipping tail.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Playability is nice except that I noted the portion where Cole sits on top for my set usually gets to fall off when handling it. My daughter loves playing with it and whipping the tail by rotating the knob at the base of the tail. Even the green scales can fold out to let cole be seen and fold inward to protect the one seated on top. What I wished it was included are 2 chains like the flying dragons for sort of control by the driver ninja. The shooting earth ball is nice, it shoots far if angled correctly.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Definitely a GREAT Dragon among the Ninjago sets. One of a kind unlike all the winged dragons. Wished LEGO made a Sea dragon as another one for its sets. Anyway, If you like dragons, this set is for you. But for the price of 35 dollars, I find it a little way above my expected price of 25 to 30 dollars. Hope this review helps. Happy Building!<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4

"Dragon_Master_48","2012-03-20T19:46:59.9Z","One of the best Ninjago Dragons; unique from the others.","<p>This set, although not the biggest dragon, is, in my opinion, the best of the bunch. The figures that come with the set are also nice. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scythe of Quakes. 
<li>Boulder with gems. 
<li>Both a torch and blade for Wyplash.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gear to move tail looks slightly awkward.

<p>This is an amazing set, and I recommend it to others. </p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"nelvan22","2011-12-29T00:10:56.87Z","GRRRR....RAWR","<p>This set is nice. The dragon is about a ten minute to five minute build and it is very cool.</p>
<p>Well heres the pros and cons. </p>
<p>Pros:Minifigures, Dragon(best part of the set), Scythe, hard to find boulder,</p>
<p>Cons: A little expensive for such a simple set, I'm not such a big fan of Ninjago but the skeletons and upcoming snake-men and especially dragons anyway im not big on the ninja riding dragon idea</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Carnistir","2011-10-20T15:27:27.713Z","Whump whump.  Earth Dragon!","<p>This is my second review, and my third dragon.&nbsp; It costs $34.99 US, and is&nbsp;very cool.&nbsp; I like the minifigures, Cole DX and Wyplash.&nbsp; Cole's suit has a golden picture of his dragon on the front.&nbsp; On the back is the elemental symbol, and his name, Cole, in gold.   &nbsp; Wyplash wears a straw hat, and the ice shoulderpads. Tha weapons included are the Scythe of Quakes, a silver katana, and a&nbsp;scythe blade (used as a sword).&nbsp; The accessories are a torch, a rock containing three gems (yellow, red and green), and an extra earth ball.&nbsp; The dragon does have tiny wings, behind his front legs.&nbsp; The tail function works nicely, and smacking Wyplash is fun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, this is a good set and you should consider buying it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
"whitesox1111","2011-12-06T17:47:48.777Z","RAWRRRR","<p>&nbsp;This is a really cool set. It is one of the sets that includes cole DX which he is only in 2 others. So if you want him get this one and wyplash comes with it too. He is only in 2 other sets also. If you want to make The Caves of Despair you really need this. Or if your going to have a collection of dragons get this one!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Building it was really easy. So if you want something easy to build get this set! One thing that i didn't like was it has to balls to shoot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The parts I really don't know how to explain them because im new here so im gonna skip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The playbility was the best part! Because Cole can fly the dragon and defeat wyplash from taking the sltyhe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;And the value for money wasn't so good. I don't really know what's happening with the prices. Soon a five dolar set right now will be 15$.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My third review will be on ninjago again.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,3
"Ultraace1022","2012-11-25T10:21:39.147Z","A good set that makes the earth shake","<p>OK, let me be totally honest with you right off the bat. I&nbsp; don't exactly own this set. a friend bought it, but then traded me the dragon, cole and wyplash, so don't expect this review to be top noch.</p><p>First off, the figures, cole dx is very nice, although personally, I thought the names on the back where unnecessary, as you already know which ninja is who. Second, wyplash. Wyplash is an OK figure, that has the only skeleton headpiece with a stud on the top. Personally, I think that LEGO should have just printed skeleton decals on actual minifigures, since their new molded bodies give them a disadvantage in the spinjitzu game as well.</p><p><br>Next, the dragon. The earth dragon is fairly large, and very flexible and playable, although I hated the back legs, so I made some personal adjustments.</p><p>Overall, this is a great set, and defiantly worth it's value.<br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,1,5,4
