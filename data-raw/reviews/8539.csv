<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the Ninjago set our son got for Christmas. And what a set it is! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the best Lego designs I have encountered. The Lightning dragon is majestic. The selection of colours is vibrant and strong. </p>
<p>The ball shooting still works; I like the inclusion of lightning bombs and shooting spears (both playable, no auto shooting). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Skeleton chopper is an interesting build with one slight flaw: it is difficult to play with and swooshing around. There are not many 'grip-points'.</p>
<p>Frackjaw with pilot helm is hilarious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all: a must in any Ninjago collection and beyond.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"FanofLego","2012-06-20T21:37:03.33Z","One of the best Ninjago installments!","<p>The Ninjago Lightning Dragon Battle is probably the most eye pleasing Ninjago set I've seen. The Lightning dragon sits on top of a stand up shelving structure in my brother's bedroom, and boy does it looks good! It's head piece is magnificently painted while it's massive wingspan makes it looks like the king of beasts! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pieces:</strong> All of the pieces, colors, and shapes are a perfect fit. I just loved how there are so many special and transparent pieces included in this set! The body and tail are longer on this dragon making it look more majestic and powerful! It's complete with lots of ball and socket joints which is great! It stays up on its hind legs and everything!&nbsp;There is a&nbsp;bit&nbsp;of gold and some really great asian character <strong><em>printed </em></strong>bricks. Jay stays firmly in his little seat and the dragon does not fall apart when lifted, (unlike the dragon in the Fire Temple (2011).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The copter also has some good pieces such as the teeth pieces, a little bit of purple, the blade as the back rotor, the winch, the skull heads as missiles,(although they make awful missiles), the rotor blades, the tire frames,(big and little). This set has some great pieces for building!</p>
<p><strong>Minifigs: </strong>The minifigures in this set are definitely good ones. They are great for Ninjago collectors. Jay DX right in his element, and his only appearance in a box set. Sensei Wu in his black gettup looks sharp, just like his awesome asian hat. General Kruncha looks pretty good, except I fear his head piece was made in China. Never the less it is probably one of the best Chinese elements I have seen. Frakjaw as the pilot was a good idea because his hat comes in the set anyways. He also looks pretty nice inside that cockpit. (Don't ask me how he sees out of there?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Flaws:</strong>This set only has one minor flaw for me, and that is the fact that it has no exciting technical contraptions that Ninjago sets usually include.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all I would highly reccomend this set for show and for a fun building and playing experience. The regular price is good and there are no disgusting cheap chinese manufactured pieces. This set appeals everyone and especially cildren! (No rude intentions towards China). If only Ninjago would stay this good!</p>

 This set was on sale at my local ToyWorld and after spending the night thinking about buying it as I was not sure about investing in yet another Lego franchise or the set&rsquo;s value I decided to go ahead and buy it anyway. Wow I was not disappointed either as after building the set it is now my No1 favorite &quot;OMG Just Look at That Thing&quot; Lego set.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Box/Instructions</p>
<p>
 Yep spot on. Box art is very representative of contents and completed models. Instructions are clear and easy to follow.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Parts</p>
<p>
 This set includes a great selection of parts and in some nice colours. You probably will not build an alternative from the parts but MOCers will find a heap of useful parts including lots of cool light blue and transparent blue cheese wedges.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Minifigures</p>
<p>
 4 Minifigs plus a spinner thing seems like good value. The 2 skeletons don&#39;t mean anything to me but I do like the blue ninja and the sensei guy. Lotsa wax on wax off value...</p>
<p>
 <br />
 The build</p>
<p>
 The dragon build was awesome and heaps of fun and I was racing to finish it by the time I got to the wings. The Copter included some interesting build techniques but ultimately it looks silly and will be going straight into the parts bins.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 The completed model</p>
<p>
 Once completed the dragon is quite fragile so it would probably not be a good toy for younger hands but with careful handling there is some quality swooshing included. The flick cannonball is a nice touch. The Copter is also swooshable but grab hook is forever falling off and really serves very little purpose.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Summary</p>
<p>
 The dragon looks AWESOME and has gone display in my office straight away which is the only Lego kit to do so. I now intend to get all the other Ninjango dragons so I can have the full set on display.</p>
<p>
 The Copter as mentioned above was OK IMO but it would be a welcome edition to any KFOL as it brings balance to the sets playability as well as a sense of value for money.<br />
 Would I recommend this set?&nbsp; Yes absolutely especially if you see it on sale. I was lucky to get it at half price but even with 10 - 20% of it would still be a good buy. Did I mention how AWESOME the dragon looks?</p>

<p>Figures - Some very good stuff here, Jay DX Is a awesome figure. OG Black wu is also very nice. Kruncha is an ok fig, Frakjaw with a pilot helmet is so funny</p>

<p>Parts - Some good stuff here too. Purple blade, exclusive moulded dragon head, printed flags, and Ball joints.</p>

<p>Building the set was pretty fun, some interesting techniques here. did feel somewhat repetetive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Play value - I think the inclusion of a bad guy helicopter adds some good fun here. Ball shooter is always fun too, so many hours of fun with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value. Price per piece is kinda high on this one, but as i said before you can have so much fun with this set.</p>

<p>Overall - YES. Incredible set. Not much wrong here. the only issue really is that the little prison thing on the helicopter flies off a bit easily. Very expensive to get your hands on this thing however as it was not sold in stores very long.&nbsp;</p>
