Granted I'm not a personal fan of Sponge Bob, I'll be playing him and Patrick there as villains for my MOCs.<br><br>At $15, you've got 3 minifigures and then the lifeboat car. <br><br>The two figures of Sponge Bob and Patrick as Heroes are very neat, cool and funny looking. Capes and all, they're very well detailed. Bob's bubble gun is cool, its a red version of the new laser pistols showing up in Alien Conquest or with some of the Collectible Minifigures and then a blue ice cream piece on it.<br><br>The third minifigure, I'm not sure I'd call a minifigure. I'm sure he's the villain that Bob and Patrick are to be chasing down. But I find it very unappealing and horribly dull looking. It's like a torpedo with metal claws on the side.<br><br>Bob and Patrick's vehicle is basically a boat on wheels. The build for that is solid enough and looks enough like it from a scene I vaguely recall seeing once. The boat is a solid and decent enough build. Though there doesn't seem to be anywhere that the two figures can sit, it's more like they stand on the boat-car.<br><br>Obviously I can see fans of Sponge Bob loving this set and picking it up. Those will be who this set most strongly appeal to.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"QwertyLEGO","2011-10-17T16:07:06.543Z","Could of been better","I just got this set last friday for $14.99! It little much for 95 pieces.<br><br>Although, I really like this set. With the cool colors, New Speedster and Elastic Wasteband type minifigures, and Plankton's Torpedo-thing form Friend or Foe.<br><br>I used to be a Spongebob fan, so thats how i know alot about spongebob. To my disappointment, I was thinking it was Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. It also comes with Bubble-Blasters.<br><br>'''Pros'''<br>*Finally a new Plankton<br>*Awesome Super Hero minifigures<br>*Blue ice cream piece<br><br>'''Cons'''<br>*$14.99<br>*No mermaid man or barnacle boy<br><br>So if you were to buy this set... You should because it is Awesome for MOCs.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3

It is great for imagination and everyone I know who bought this set has loved it. It includes spongebob, patrick, and plankton. The features of the car are the phone in the middle of the car, the bubble blasters on the sides of the car and the colorful superhero designs on the car. Like I said I think it's awesome and I give it a 5/5 and I totally recomend this set to a friend. Thanks for reading!&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"legolover9","2012-04-28T17:17:33.23Z","Awesome Spongebob Set","This set was so awesome. It was like a special edition set. The boat was so cool I built is several times. The mixed and matched the mini-figures for fun. The really, really fun part is making different models of the car and the min-figure capes.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,4,5,5,5
"HarleyMeenen","2016-09-04T05:05:39.07Z","Nice Quick Build","<p>I&#39;m not sure I would have thought to get this set for myself, but it was a gift and I&#39;m really glad to have it. It&#39;s a quick, simple build but it&#39;s fun and has a nice look when finished.</p>

<p>The instructions don&#39;t list the pieces per step, so they can be a little tricky to follow at times, but since there isn&#39;t anything very difficult it&#39;s not too bad. I find vehicles to normally be boring or repetitive, but that really isn&#39;t the case here. The build is quick and colorful.</p>

<p>The minifigures are also a nice touch for the set. They are different from standard minifigures to accommodate the odd shapes of the characters, and it is very well done.</p>

<p>The set is admittedly a&nbsp;little pricey for what you get. In the end, however, for a small set with one main build, this is a good choice for Spongebob fans.</p>

"LegoBatmanLandon","2018-02-24T16:53:35.853Z","the best lego boat","<p>Got this set for Christmas a few years back, and it still holds up to this day with exclusive minifigures, exclusive pieces and an overall flawless boat model. if your a&nbsp;fan of Spongebob of cartoony superheroes, this is the set for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: Patrick&#39;s costume, Plankton is an exclusive piece in a robot suit with an exclusive body print, the formula is an exclusive print, Spongebob has a great costume, the bubble missiles have red flick missiles, the yellow boat hull is exclusive.</p>

<p>Cons: although the suits are awesome, they are not in the tv show what so ever, other than that, nothing is bad.&nbsp;</p>

"Brickdarg","2022-01-30T22:40:48.92Z","The worst spongebob set","<p>This set is the epitome of a missed opportunity. This would&#39;ve been the perfect set to get &nbsp;Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in minifigure form, but we are instead left with Spongebob and Patrick in random superhero costumes that aren&#39;t even reminiscent of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Additionally, this set should&#39;ve included a Man-Ray minfigure, but instead we just get Plankton with the Krusty Krab secret formula. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Plankton&#39;s little vehicle is very cool, and the boat itself is serviceable and has some nice elements to it, but the figure selection just disappoints. Only pick this set up if you want to own every Spongebob set.</p>
