"me62","2011-08-15T14:56:59.19Z","pretty cool","I've had this set for about a week. I thought it was pretty easy to build but out of the easy building I got a set that was great with play. It has a rotating ferris wheel and a revolving door. The minifigures are spongebob patrick ice cream guy and sandy. this set has a few good details and I would recomend this set to a friend. I rate this 4half/5. Thanks for reading.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,4,4,5,4

It has more playability&nbsp;than Heroic Heroes, but still not perfect.<div><br></div><div>If you don't know, Glove World is a theme park frequently seen or mentioned in the Spongebob cartoon. It consists of several glove-based rides, attractions, and merchandise. This set contains four minifigures:</div><div><br></div><div><b>Spongebob: </b>This is a new Spongebob. He is laughing pretty hard in this set. That's really it. Like all Spongebobs, he has the big slip on piece that goes over a yellow torso and the small brown legs. He doesn't have back-printing, so it looks like he doesn't have a shirt on from the back. He is also sleeveless, which is weird. I remember Spongebob having two little white sleeves that weren't attached to his shirt :P</div><div><br></div><div><b>Patrick: </b>This is the third variation of Patrick.He has the same general body, it's just the printing that's changed. In preliminary pictures it looked like Patrick was wearing a Glove World shirt. They've changed that. Now, Patrick has his normal pointed head, except it's laughing and he's covered with chocolate ice-cream. His torso is also sleeveless (which makes sense, because Patrick wears no shirt) and he has no back-printing. He is wearing a baby blue bib with a yellow duck on it. You'd think a glove would've been more appropriate. His legs are the same. He's wearing his green shorts with purple flowers on it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Sandy: </b>Sandy's second variation and the second set she was in. Not much has changed, really. Her helmet is comprised of two clear pieces that snap together, after you used them to encase her head. Her head is specially shaped and came in a bag. Her head is squirrel-like with brown fur on top and light fur on the bottom. She has two ears sticking out and wide eyes, as well as two buckteeth. Very cool head piece. She has a white astronaut torso with an acorn symbol She also has a zipper on her torso to take off the suit (printed, not real). Her legs are white with the gray waist.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Glove World Employee: </b>While there've been three fish minifigures total in Lego Spongebob, this is the first with this printing. This guy has a yellow head and a chin that sort of&nbsp;hangs&nbsp;over his torso. He has pink lips open in a smile and big&nbsp;wide&nbsp;eyes. He's obviously enjoying his job, or he's a good actor. He's got a little purple fin in the back, which was a nice touch. He's wearing a little hat (stud piece) on top of his head. He's got a blue torso on with white stripes and a red bow tie. He's also got blue legs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigure Complaints/Suggestions:&nbsp;</b>So four minifigures overall, all new. Now, while I love the minifigures, I do have one complaint. This actually sort of goes for the whole set, really, you'll see why in the set. Sandy never visited Glove World. In the cartoon, she never visited the theme park (well, she sort of did in one episode, but not really). In the cartoon, we frequently see the mascot of Glove World, a gigantic glove. Maybe that would be hard to create as a minifigure because he was so...puffy. But I feel that besides the name and occasional picture, it's not really GLOVE World.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Entrance/Ice-Cream Stand: </b>The first part of the set is both the entrance and an ice-cream stand. On the right side there is a little doorway with one of those revolving gates that are stuck unless you put a ticket through. It's red, by the way. Above is a sign that says Glove World with a glove in the background, Above is a yellow flag with a glove. On the left is the ice-cream stand. There is a little counter for the employee to stand behind. There is a couple ice-creams you can put there. It's really two clear&nbsp;goblets. One has a brown stud in it, another has chocolate ice-cream. There's a tile hanging from the bit of wall in between the entrance and ice-cream stand that shows an ice-cream with prices. Above the ice-cream stand in a red and blue awning.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Entrance and Ice-Cream Stand Complaints: </b>Not much to say, really. I just kinda wished they'd expanded this and made a gift shop with glove merchandise or a game or something. I don't know about anyone else, but I would've still bought it even if it meant increased prices.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Ferris Wheel: </b>This is definitely the coolest part of the set. It's the&nbsp;Ferris&nbsp;wheel. Three identical seats with enough room for any mini-figure to sit comfortably and a glove-world tile facing outwards, and a safety bar. The seats are connected with some Technic pieces that is attached to a big backboard or something. In the back of this back-board is a round piece you turn to turn the Ferris Wheel, and voila. Your minifigures are having the time of their life.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Ferris Wheel Complaints: </b>Again, not much. One thing I guess that could've been done was make the seats look like giant gloves, but I don't know if that's possible.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall: </b>This is a decent set, though it's not perfect. A kid can have plenty of fun. My major complaint is how small it is. Imagine going to a theme park and there's only one ride. Nonetheless, the Ferris wheel is pretty cool. Another thing is i&nbsp;wish&nbsp;they'd shown how it was GLOVE World a little more. Still, it's a good set. I think little kids will like this set. Thanks for reading!</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"SmythTheCrow","2014-07-12T04:27:54.137Z","nice one","<p>I got this set 2 years ago and it looks cool. It comes with an ice cream stand/entrance with not many features like the revolving door....thing and a Ferris wheel where you can fit 3 minifigures on it. Oh, and it will rotate 360 degrees</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New Designs for the minifigures</p>

<p>The Ferris wheel and it&#39;s features</p>

<p>Simple build</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Flag breaks off easily&nbsp;</p>

<p>Needs more rides&nbsp;</p>

<p>Entrance could have been bigger</p>

<p>Overall: I give it a 4/5 stars. I highly recommend it. Thx for reading</p>
