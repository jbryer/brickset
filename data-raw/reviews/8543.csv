"dougts","2011-06-08T17:58:32.44Z","Bigger than I thought ","Not going to write a terribly long review for a $5 impulse buy, but figured I would check in really quick. &nbsp;picked up 2 of these today and my 5 year old and I just put the first one together. &nbsp;My immediate reaction was that it was bigger than I thought - and I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting something about the size of the boat included in the new lighthouse set, but it was bigger by about half.<div><br></div><div>Nothing too remarkable about the pieces or build obviously. &nbsp;A real prop would have been a nice finishing touch, but I guess you can't expect too much from a mini set like this. &nbsp;the boat hull pieces are nice, and it does come with 3 of the sliders mounted to the bottom for playability (glide!), and a full minifigure complete with life preserver.</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, one of the better $5 sets I've bought recently, and I think the value for the cost is quite good actually.</div>",TRUE,4,2,2,3,5
"kenhew","2011-07-06T07:01:13.26Z","Brilliantly simple","This set is just what it appears to be, a speedboat. No surprises, straightforward build, a few good parts (windscreen, red hull) and a nice add-on to your LEGO city. No complains on the price, as I think it's just right. Too bad it doesn't float :)",FALSE,3,3,2,3,4
"Fire6","2011-07-09T13:37:01.897Z","Speed Boat...um...Get the Jet Ski Instead","Compared to other standard impulse box sets or the poly bags, this one falls short in every way...if you are looking for additional boats to populate your new <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=4644-1"">Marina</a>, this one isn't worth it...<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Boat</span><br><br>The Boat is small, red and white and looks better on the box than assembled. When completely assembled the speed boat just looks...awkward. The front piece does not flow into the rest of the boat and it makes the set look incomplete, like the designers couldn't be bothered to include the last half of the boat. A little kid may like it...but my 10 year old nephew said that it looked wrong too...<br><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Mini-fig</span><br><br>The Mini-fig isn't anything special, in fact it makes absolutely no sense. The mini-fig included has the standard blue Octan top with blue legs. This top covered up by the life preserver, but it seems like it would have made more sense to include a mini-fig top that was more, out-doorsy.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Final Thoughts</span><br><br>The speed boat was a great disappointment and remember thinking that I wanted my money back. I find that the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=30015-1"">Jet Ski</a> is a much better option for anyone looking for cheap, additional boats for their Marina. I plan on taking the speed boat and converting it to something more akin to the Jet Ski, since I feel the boat has no redeeming value what so ever beyond spare parts.<br>",TRUE,1,2,2,3,2

"brisnatmo","2011-11-19T16:02:59.38Z","Great impulse buy speedboat!","<p>This speedboat is is priced as an impulse buy (I got it for AU$6.73), and it should be looked at that way.&nbsp; It is a great little speedboat, that will fit in well in any Lego harbour.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Beings an impulse buy, it has a small box, in the simple format - just one main photo on the box, and a minifig picture.&nbsp; No parts list on the box like on larger models.&nbsp; The instructions are brief, with steps on 17 of the 24 pages.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are 35 parts in the box, with 34 used in the model - a price of 19.2 cents per piece.&nbsp; The spare part is the only 1x1 part, the ubiquitous 1x1 small slope.&nbsp; The model contains some good parts -&nbsp;red and black sloping grills, yellow and white flat 2x1 grills, some interesting hooks and handles and the life preserver stand out.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>I don't understand why Octan Energy seems to be sponsoring ALL the boat drivers in Lego City.&nbsp; Either Octan is selling really cheap spray jackets, or they have the boating industry sewn up!&nbsp; Nevertheless, the all blue minifig comes with silver sunglasses, a blue ball cap and a life preserver as mentioned above.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>At 34 actual pieces, this is a quick build.&nbsp; Until the large red front (the bow piece) goes on, it is very delicate, and can fall apart if not built on a table.&nbsp; Every step is straight forward with nothing ambiguous in the instructions.&nbsp; The brick built motor is very nice.&nbsp; I was also surprised by the smooth round pieces for under the hull - so the kids can slide it around on the carpet without it catching - good playability feature.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This is a good looking boat, it looks fast and sleek, and it is six lugs wide.&nbsp; Some have complained about the lines of the boat, but the two lugs on each side at the cockpit are necessary for the minifig to stand on the edge when getting in or tying it off at the harbour!&nbsp; The scale of the model seems quite realistic to me. (For the record, I do not believe it will float, as the hull has many holes in it, but I could be wrong - I haven't tested that yet.)</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Definitely worth an impulse buy - great colour, great scale, great looking motor on the back.&nbsp; If you see it cheap, add a speedboat to your City!</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,4
"What_Sup_Lego_Fans","2011-12-23T01:09:10.35Z","4641- Speed Boat","<p>Today I am going to be reviewing the 4641 Speed Boat. It contains 34 pieces and it costs $10 Nz Dollars. The boat can float but it&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;say on the boat. You get 1 minifigure with this set.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is small. The instructions are easy to follow. I am very excited about this set because it comes in a box rather than a polybag. This is because the set is small for this price.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There is nothing much to say about the parts. There are some big parts. The price per piece is high.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get 1 minifigure. It is just an octan guy with blue hat, shirt and pants and the face is yellow. He does come with a yellow lifejacket and he does not have back printing.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very easy and it only took 5 minutes.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It comes with a boat and 1 minifigure. It looks good but you need the marina or the harbour to have more playability.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overall- 10/10</h4>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,5

"vikings","2020-06-01T06:11:27.59Z","Nice Little Speedboat ","<p><strong>Box/Instruction:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box are 4.8 x 3.6 x 2.3 inches and weighs around 0.18 pounds. It comes with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a few nice pieces in this set. You get a white inverted double bow and a red double bow. Other than that you don&#39;t get any other cool or unique parts. Overall some okay parts. The total piece count of the set is 34.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Boat Driver:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The figure in this set is pretty basic. He comes with a blue hat and a single sided head. The head is a classic Lego city head with the smile and shiny sunglasses. He has a yellow life jacket. His torso has printing of an Octan oil shirt. It has the Octan logo on the right side of the shirt and the word Oil on the left. He has plain blue legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build. The technique to build the engine while simple are&nbsp;really cool.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice addition to your Lego city collection. The design of the engine is amazing. The boat as a whole is really good and will be a great addition to your Lego harbour. The figure is pretty simple, but works well with this set. I highly recommend this set to add to your Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Speed_champions_fan","2017-10-10T19:33:57.43Z","Absolutely fantastic! ","<p>At this price point, the lego&nbsp;city sets released tend to be a mixed bag. Containing a lot of quad bikes. However, occasionally something spectacular appears. This is one of those models.</p>

<p>The build is very simple. All studs on top, save for the motor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts are actually really good. It&#39;s the cheapest set to include the hull pieces and the windscreen. Plus, the side bits are rare in red.</p>

<p>The minifigure has a blue&nbsp;octan oil jacket, with blue legs and&nbsp;a blue cap. He has a smiling face with silver sunglasses. This is one of the most common city faces, but at least it&#39;s generic.</p>

<p>The finished model looks amazing. No other word for it. It&#39;s large for its size, it looks very sleek, and the yellow breaks up the surprisingly not blocky engines. It really is one of the best sets at this price point, and is in my top 10 city sets of all time. A brilliant set.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-07T20:43:15.007Z","A nice addition to my harbor ","<p>Lego set #4641 is a great addition to any Lego city harbor. This little set is jampacked with thirty-four pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure&nbsp;in this set is a fairly plain guy just with the classic sunglasses, an Octan shirt, life vest, and a blue cap. The Octan shirt could be found to be different variations in this and many other sets back in the day. Also his life vest came with both the style he is seen in the photo with and a different style as well.</p>

<p>The boat is nothing to fancy and is a nice, easy, and quick build. The only play function on this set is that it&#39;s motor can be moved up and down.</p>

<p>Overall i think this set is a nice fun addition to any Lego City harbor.</p>

"ARandomLegoFan","2021-01-25T20:54:38.77Z","Quite a good boat","<p>Part 1. The boat.</p>

<p>The front is sculpted nicely with curves and grills. The side unfortunately has an awkward transition from front to back but I don&#39;t know how the could continue it smoothly without a new piece. so I won&#39;t knock off points for it. The back has a nice outboard motor which looks great and more nice shapes. The roof has an extra grill. The interior is the bare minimum and they sadly used a blue steering wheel column which doesn&#39;t fit.</p>

<p>Part 2. The figure.</p>

<p>The figure is unnamed of course since this is a 2011 set. He has a blue torso with no backprinting a octan logo and oil written on. He also has blue legs, a life jacket, sunglasses and a hat.</p>

<p>Pros.</p>

<p>Nice boat shaping, great onboard motor build and good price.</p>

<p>Cons.</p>

<p>Blue steering wheel column.</p>
