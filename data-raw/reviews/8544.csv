"Higgins","2011-05-03T00:58:36.883Z","It Floats!","<p>This set <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">(City 4642) Fishing Boat</span> is ages 5-12 and was picked up from TRU on May 1st 2011. It is a very easy set to build due to the one piece hull accounting for so much of the model, but that isn't really anything new when it comes to boats. That also brought the price per piece way up. Only 64 pieces are in this set. One of the minifigures (there are two) has the short non-moveable 'kid' legs. The fishing pole is larger and 'cooler' than the ones included with CMF Fisherman and Gnome. <br></p>

Overpriced for the pieces although I am not sure how much one should take the hull piece into consideration to account for that. On a personal level, I was not interested in any other City boats that recently came out, but this one I liked because overall it's still fairly cheap, looks sleek with decent stickers (6 total), and comes with a nice fishing pole - it's tied in two places and the string is threaded through the tip of the pole.<br><br>It's nice looking and floating is a a bonus for playability but overpriced considering the piece count (although see above thoughts)<br><br><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,2
"JDLego","2011-05-15T13:04:10.99Z","Good Start-Off for Harbour","<p>I couldnt wait to get my hands on these new CITY Harbour sets, so I drove to my local Toys R Us and saw Only The Harbour, The Marina, and this one. So I grabbed The Fishing Boat, I was looking to get The speed Boat also but they didnt have it, and I am trying to divide my money to other sets so I didnt want to get the Harbour or Marina just yet. Anyways I brought it to the till and paid $28.00 for it!, which I think is a little pricey for only 64 peices, but then again the hull could float and it was medium sized. Its a good 2nd set for the Harbour sets and a good addition to your city or town. There was no interior but a seat and controls up top with horns, an antenna and lights. A seat in the back with a handle for the fishing rod, a coffee mug. Came with a life preserver and two lifejackets. Also came with a Fish and Shark(!). Two minfigures were included, one a kid with blue short legs, white sweater, face with freckels and a Lime Green Hat! The Father also had blue pants(Normal Size), dark blue shirt, normal face and orange reddish hair. Overall the building was very fast, lots of playablilty, A little pricey for 64 pieces but it floats! I just think its a good start to Harbour, and the other new Lego CITY sets. Good job LEGO and lets see some more fantastic sets!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"taffer1979","2011-05-16T00:39:43.013Z","Great Looks, but thats it.","<p>I bought this boat with the expectation that it would a cabin under the driver, it does not. The pictures make it appear to have a under cabin, there is a window and elevated driver deck. The minifigs dont even fit under there, I tried sitting one down there he still won't fit.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nice Looking Fishing Boat 
<li>Deep Sea Fishing Pool 
<li>Boat Floats(not that I would ever put it in water)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>No Cabin area 
<li>No room in the back of boat 
<li>64 Pieces 
<li>Kid's legs should move 
<li></li></ul>
<p>This is a nice looking boat I would recommand for anyone building there Lego city Harbor. It's playability is somewhat limited, unless you bought it for your kid's bathtime, then it would be awesome. Building experience limited(good for beginner set). &nbsp;I think the price was just about right, I got it for $16.99 at my local TRU. $14.00 would have been ideal and they could keep the shark.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4
"craigpowers","2011-11-19T10:32:32.683Z","No love for the Fishing Boat?","<p>I was surprised by the relatively low reviews this set has received on brickset.com, given that it appeared, to me, to be a solid offering from Lego. &nbsp;I have two Lego police boats (sets 4010 and 4021), but this was the first ""civilian"" watercraft that I added to mine and my son's collection. &nbsp;Granted, $19.99 for 64 pieces gives this set one of the highest price per piece ratios I've ever seen, but I still think it was a good buy for what I got. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Aesthetic. &nbsp;Although this set does not feature a whole lot minute details, the boat, overall, has very nice lines and looks a lot like real deep water fishing boats I've seen.</li><li>Build. &nbsp;Again, Lego missed on a few opportunities to really polish off the set (cabin interior, better wheel house), but the boat is a solid set once put together, and is easy to rebuild without the use of instructions, something that is a plus for me, given that my young son likes to tinker and pull them apart. &nbsp;I always like to get my sets back to 100% before putting them away after playing.</li><li>Pieces. &nbsp;Some might not be thrilled by the one-piece hull, but I like it from a customization, build-my-own boat perspective, in that I'm not wasting precious pieces to construct a hull that probably won't look as nice as this one does, anyway. &nbsp;Additionally, shark, fish, fishing pole, and life preservers are all nice accessories that can be used in your own creations, but also are very complimentary to this set as it is.</li><li>Possibilities/Playability. &nbsp;Where Lego may have left off too soon on finishing this set to perfection, there is room for collectors to modify or completely rebuild this set into their own vision of a boat using the pieces provided, plus any they have lying around. &nbsp;This is a very good set for that, and the playability, as the set is, is very high given the accessories and figures provided. &nbsp;If you have a collection of watercraft or marina set pieces, like I do, this boat fits in nicely, is of good size, and gives one more outlet for imagination that Lego is so good at fostering.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>""Floats."" &nbsp;I bought this set, in part, because of it's appeal and uniqueness in relation to my collection, but also so my 5 year old son could play with in the water. &nbsp;However, every time I put this boat in the tub, it would list to one side, then go full tilt and begin to fill with water. &nbsp;Not much fun for my son. &nbsp;We have since stopped putting it in the water, but he still enjoys playing with it, nonetheless.</li><li>Lack of detail. &nbsp;My two previous boat sets had nice interior touches, including an engine housing, multiple control panels, desk with chair, and storage for accessories. &nbsp;This set is virtually empty underneath the upper structure where there is plenty of room for at least a table or bed, or some kind of storage. &nbsp;Definitely a missed opportunity on Lego's part.</li></ul>
<p>I understand some of the disappointment many Lego collectors have experienced from acquiring this set, but I guess I see things differently. &nbsp;Where there are definitely some missed opportunities on Lego's part to make this set superb, there arises the other part of playing with Legos that many owners are familiar with: the customization/build-your-own idea possibility. &nbsp;If you have $20 to spend on a set, think real hard before necessarily settling on this one, as I agree with others that there are better offerings from Lego at the same price level. &nbsp;However, if you're in the market for a simple watercraft to add to your collection, this set fits that need quite well, and is an attractive addition to any City collection.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"Sithbuilder66","2021-03-09T19:56:27.35Z","Very nice set for my MOC","<p>this set is really good, it&#39;s one of the best LEGO boats we&#39;ve had. It goes really well in my MOC that I am creating. The only reason this set doesn&#39;t have a better review is because I don&#39;t remember building it since I built it years ago.</p>

<p>thanks for reading!</p>
