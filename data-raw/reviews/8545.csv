<p>I got this set at much less than the RRP.&nbsp; Everywhere seems to have it at £20 or less which is £10 below the RRP.&nbsp; It's a nice build.&nbsp; The lorry is 6 dots wide and is really cool complete with stickers and 'wide load' indicators at the rear.&nbsp; There is also a storage area for the life belts and helmets.&nbsp;The powerboat sits neatly on the back and looks nice and sporty!&nbsp; The boat floats (not sure how that works with the stickers) so will have plenty bath time playability for children.&nbsp; The minifigs are a bit disappointing with their Octan 'suits'.....could've been spiced up a bit although you can eccorise them with the life belts and helmets.</p>
<p>This set sits well within my city.&nbsp; The lorry can be used to transport a car if need be and the boat looks good with the harbour.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Good build. 
<li>Cool lorry. 
<li>Floating boat. 
<li>Good (reduced) price. 
<li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minifigs could be better 
<li></li></ul>
<p>Really good set for the price.&nbsp; Nice lorry and boat.&nbsp; Great set for playability.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"richselby","2012-01-27T08:11:21.913Z","Best Bath Time Boat","<p>Really this set is about the large floating boat, perfect for the bath tub. In fact my two year old son really wouldn't take a bath without it. My 7 year old son is also rather happy to have it in the tub with him. Being a dad of 40, I've yet to take it in the bath with me. But maybe I should give it a try one day.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The &nbsp;boat hull is a one piece special, which is not surprising considering it floats. Very low possibility of reusing this one in anything other than a boat.</div><div><br></div><div>There was a pleasant surprise when it came to the life jackets. The bulky yellow life jackets in the picture have been replaced by new sleeker design. A much needed refresh of the mould.</div><div><br></div><div>Otherwise, there was a big long poopy grey base plate for the lorry. And a few technic bits to attach the lorry trailer to the cab.</div><div><br></div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Two pretty ordinary chaps, bedecked in Octan uniform. They stay in the boat on its bath time missions. Must be the cleanest minifigs in the world now.&nbsp;</div>
<h4><br></h4><h4>The build</h4><div>As an AFOL, there was nothing in the build to excite me. But perfectly suitable for my 7 yr old son though.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>The lorry looked nice, but wasn't very strong. It didn't survive too long before it made it back into the parts bucket. The boat looks rather nice too with its long sleek curved deck.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>If you want a good value Lego boat to play with in the bath, then this is the set for you.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,3,2,5,5
"paul_merton","2012-06-16T14:01:40.92Z","Excellent value","The truck, trailer and speedboat each comes with its own instruction book and can be built independently. The truck is a nice solid-feeling design, but because it has no steering, the grippy rubber tyres tend to make it not to want to do anything other than go in a straight line.<br><br>To accomodate for the slope of the trailer, the rear wheels hang loose, which seems a bit weird when you pick it up. The boat itself is quite nice, being made out of a two-part white hull and deck, with a bunch of bricks on top and inside.<br><br>The hull material feels softer than normal LEGO bricks, but seems to have no problem going together. The whole thing floats if that, er, floats your boat.<br><br>I'm not a fan of stickers in a set. They never last the passage of time, so I didn't even bother applying mine.&nbsp; The set still looks okay without them.&nbsp; The two minifigs are basic City types and you get two baseball caps and two helmets (the boat has two seats).<br><br>Altogether, I thought this was pretty good value.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
