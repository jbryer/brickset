Upon arrival at the LEGO store, I snagged the last marina set off the shelf and checked out, for a grand total of&nbsp; $50. I knew the sets price was bad, but I bought it anyways. Set is worth $30&nbsp;to me. Now, onto <font color=""#000000"">the review!</font>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>At a glance, the is alarmangly large for what you get. The box-art is nice, and apeeling, but not much else to say. The instructions are not in plastic lining with cardboard, but were thrown in the box. Yeah, this doesn't have it, but PoTC set Captains cabin does! Anyways, the instructions were bent up, with the stickers lying curled up at the bottom of the box. This&nbsp;annyys me, ever heard Ole Kirk Christiansen's quote, which is the motto of LEGO, &quot;Only the best is good enough&quot;.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&nbsp;When I pulled the bags of parts out of the box,&nbsp; there were huge bags, filled with barely any parts. Bags are numbered 1-4.&nbsp; The parts these bags contained are very juinorized and large, making the building experience easy and borring. We get some rare green awning slopes (As I call them).&nbsp; We also see the debut of my favorite part in the set, a lime green umbrella. We also get a black printed computer screen, which is really a square sign with a clip on the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also get two surfboards, one is white, the other, yellow. Another unique part is a large blue raft piece, used for the speedboat.&nbsp; There are 4 sets of flippers, two being green, and two being orange!&nbsp; This set has many unique pieces, but two many are juniorized.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Here, we get a fine selection of beach-goers. In the first bag, we get a lifeguard, a man with a white tank-top, that has a picture of a windsurfing minifigure, two divers, each with a new wet-suit piece and silver helmets&nbsp;with scuba&nbsp;masks and airtanks.&nbsp; When we open the third bag, we get, a female minifigure whos torso printing is a star lined tank-top, the same as the one that comes with the City House set. This set has nice, unique minifigures with great torso printing and accesories.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>We start off building the minifigures, then we build a bouy. The bouy has a flag piece that a sticker is added to. Next we build the wind-surfing board, convienently, 4 pieces. It has a plastic thin plastic sail that is an uncommon piece.</p>
<p>Next we build the ATV,&nbsp;it is a fun shade of yellow, and is similar to the ATVs included in many other city sets. Next, we construct the speedboat. It utalizes a large blue raft piece, and the construction goes from the bottom up mainly. There are two stickers that are added to the side of the boat, each saying PN 4644. There is room for diving gear, flippers, a scuba helmet, and airtanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, we build the marina, which is seperated into 3 parts, the tower, surfshop, and restaurant. The tower sits on a new 8x16 plate.&nbsp;Two supports hold up the tower, with a space for the ATV below it. On the tower, there are 3 flags, red, yellow, and green, used to indicate how safe the waters are (Known by my knowledge).&nbsp; Next, we build the surf shop, There is a rack for lifevests, a small stand for an airtank, and a the cash register. The shop therefore, is kinda empty, leaving much room for modding. The restaurant, has a small counter, and a coffee machine. on the wall behind the coffee machine is a sticker, whch shows prices for food.&nbsp; Outside of the restaurant, there is a balcony, with the green umbrella&nbsp;that I really dig, and seats for two minifigures. The build is easy and takes a very short amount of time. A bridge sits between the tower and the restaurant.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed model is very large, but even by looking from a distance, one can see how juniroized the parts are. On the brightside, it looks very lively, even with the limited&nbsp; amount of minifigures included.&nbsp; The colors stand out and create a great look in my LEGO town. The completed model is very nice, and again is very large.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This set is great! A bad value for money, a poor building experience, but it is a great set! I recomend it to any LEGO fan, no-matter how juniorized it is!</p>
<p>LEGO expected this set to sell quickly, and it will live up to that prediction! The set is not perfect, but very good! I give this set a 7/10!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3
"phipfwe76","2011-05-25T17:16:59.463Z","Welcome to the (slightly overpriced) marina!","<p>Just picked this set up a few weeks ago as it hit the shelves. Didn't realize how much it was at first, but bought it anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get a decent collection of mini-figs with the marina. There's a lifeguard, who has a torso seen in many other City sets, a lady with a stared tanktop, a lady for the sailboat with a unique top, a scuba diver, and a boat driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build isn't bad at all. You start with the boat, which is all one piece. It has a printed piece and three seats for other passengers. It also has places to set flippers and an air tank. Well thought out design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The marina itself is pretty big in size as it includes a good number of large pieces. The lifeguard stand has flags to show the water condition, and is high enough up to store the ATV under. Over the bridge is the shop, which is very bare but you can fill it with your own items. Above that is the little cafe, which has a table, chairs, and the often seen coffee pot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has tons of playability for a younger fan, however neither boat can fit underneath the bridge. It's a welcome addition to any city collector's set. Only complain is this is a set that is less then 300 pieces yet it runs for $50. While many pieces are large I see it as a $40 set.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"SgtSmash","2011-06-30T17:48:08.963Z","A nice set but does not justify the cost","<p>I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviews on the Marina set. It's a nice set, but no way should it cost anywhere near $49.99 USD. I'm not sure how&nbsp;Lego justifies the pricing on their sets.&nbsp;I'd suggest a retail of $34.99 USD, at most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do get some cool stuff,&nbsp;and some neat features. The lifeguard tower with colored flags, the surf shop&nbsp;is&nbsp;maybe the coolest feature...then you have the&nbsp;Cafe Paradise&nbsp;which features a wall menu showing&nbsp;burgers and ice cream, but&nbsp;only a coffee machine in the joint.&nbsp;You do get a&nbsp;place to sit outside to enjoy&nbsp;your invisible meal though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The boat is pretty cool as well, with 5 minifigs: (2) deep sea explorers, one&nbsp;female surf shop worker,&nbsp;what appears to be a lifeguard but wearing a hoodie, and a surfer dude with windboard. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It didn't take long to put this set together, and I'll need to get a couple blue water plates to set this on. I'm happy that I only paid $5.00 for this set, thanks to the recent Toys R Us ""Buy Two, get one 90% off sale"". The price was right, and I did that because there was no way I'd pay what Lego wants for it. I tend to wait for these sales because on the whole, these sets cost way too much.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,2
"stagus","2011-09-01T07:01:23.073Z","Great set but over-priced","<p>As stated in the other reviews this set is overpriced but hunting around does work to get the set cheaper than the RRP.&nbsp; The set is a fabulous addition to my city with excellent colours and a fun place near the water as opposed to the usual cargo freight everywhere!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I really liked the minifigs in this, particularly the divers and the surfer.</p>
<p>It is a straightforward build and has lots of playability for children with the buggy, divers, windsurfing, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nice colurs 
<li>Good minifigs 
<li>Lots of playability 
<li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Price 
<li>Price 
<li>&amp; Price! 
<li>…</li></ul>
<p>All in all a great set let down by the cost.&nbsp; As I have already said shop around (I picked up for £29 from Amazon).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
"av8r1973","2011-08-22T02:18:57.453Z","Lots of playability and colors, falters a bit on price and implementation","I had a hard time with the review on this set. &nbsp;As others mention, the set should be about $10-15 cheaper. &nbsp;We picked it up full retail at a LEGO store in Phoenix, but used some VIP points to counter the cost.<div><br></div><div>My daughters built the whole set independent of me, which either means the directions are great or the girls are just getting better at reading them. &nbsp;There were some new angles for element placement that were nice to see for some of the ones that were less clear. &nbsp;I'll try for a standard pro/con list here.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div>1.

"mini_mads1980","2012-09-04T04:08:26.883Z","Good set that should have been two","<p>I recently recieved this set after purchasing on-line for a very reasonable £18.99 (<em>thank you</em> <em>Brickset!</em>).&nbsp; It was the last of the sets I&nbsp;needed to complete my collection&nbsp;of&nbsp;the 2011 harbour sets.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only reason I bought it was the reduced price.&nbsp; But, having made it I do like it more than I thought I would.&nbsp; However, once I had finished making the set I could not see why Lego put it together as one set rather than two.&nbsp; The Life Guard Tower, Buggy and Diving Boat would have made a good set alone, and the Beach shop, Cafe and Wind Surfer would have made another good set.&nbsp; The completely pointless (in my view)&nbsp;bridge section could then be totally removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bridge is too low for either the Boat or the Wind Surfer to pass under, and I have subsequently removed it.&nbsp; I will now use the stair element to construct access to the Paradise Cafe instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My biggest complaint about this set though is the Life Jackets that are on display&nbsp;outside the shop.&nbsp; The picture clearly shows the older, much better chunky Life Jackets, yet upon opening the set I find they have put the newer small Life Jackets in.&nbsp; Whether this is because it is a later version and Lego have stopped making the older Life Jackets, I do not know.&nbsp; It has certainly caused a problem with the build.&nbsp; The smaller Life Jackets do not stay on the display stand and fall straight through!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall the sets RRP&nbsp;seems to be too high for what you get, but if you can&nbsp;purchase it at a reduced price then it is worth it - with a couple of tweaks to the build.&nbsp; I like the Cafe and Beach Shop, and the elevated Life Guard Hut and Buggy are simple but affective.&nbsp; The Boat with diver is nice and I have always like the Lego Wind Surfer dating way back to my first one in set 6351 (Surf N' Sail Camper).</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,3
"Windsorlego","2019-08-14T23:47:23.957Z","Good set","<p>I rather enjoyed making this set.&nbsp; I liked the white and green of the cafe and the lifeguard&#39;s station.&nbsp; I thought the shop was a little empty and could have done with some other items to buy or hire.</p>

<p>Three figures for a set that is just under 300 pieces I felt was good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bridge between the two buildings was far too low to allow the surfboarder to pass under it.&nbsp; I therefore added bricks at the bottom of both sets of steps&nbsp;to extend the height of the bridge.</p>

<p>I gathered together a total of ten dark grey 2x4 bricks, four dark grey 1x4 bricks, four dark grey 1x1 bricks, two dark grey 1x2 plates, four light grey&nbsp;2x3 plates and eight dark blue&nbsp;1x3x3 arches (13965). This is what you require for both sets of steps.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the dark grey steps provided I put a 1x1 brick under&nbsp;each side and the 1x2 plate under the middle section.</p>

<p>A series of steps is then made by adding five 2x4 bricks so they look like a series of steps.&nbsp; At the back of the second brick down I added a 1x4 brick and did the same at the back of the fifth brick.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/183469819@N06/48539416661/in/dateposted-public/"" />The arches are placed so that the top of the arches are under the 1x4 brick behind the second 2x4 brick and they will finish behind the 1x4 brick at the back of the fifth 2x4 brick.&nbsp; At the bottom of the four arches, 1x4 brick and half the 2x4 brick I placed two 2x3 plates.&nbsp; The arches add stability to the bridge.</p>

<p>Using the instructions in Book 2 Page 6&nbsp;Section 6 follow the above and place the bottom 2x4 brick where it shows the grey steps going. You can then carry on with making the set.&nbsp; Making the extra steps is repeated on Page 22 Section 4.</p>

<p>If you can follow my instructions with no pics you will be geniuses!!!!</p>

<p>(Sorry, couldn&#39;t understand how to load the photos, much too complicated for me!)</p>
