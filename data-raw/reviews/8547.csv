"The_Beast","2011-07-17T11:25:17.997Z","Good... but  with problems","A couple of years ago (before I collected Lego) a Harbor series was released. This, being the &nbsp;second attempt didn't do much better. It was a fun set to build but I found a couple of issues with the set, instruction manual and play ability.<br><br><div>I will go more into detail later on (about the cons)<br><div>Pros:&nbsp;</div><div>-Fully functioning conveyor belt</div></div><div>-Back of truck tilts to dump loads off</div><div>-Nice captains quarters on board</div><div>-Crane that can transport the cargo to the conveyor belt (they are supposed to be rocks)&nbsp;</div><div>-Yellow and blue go very nicely together</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:&nbsp;</div><div>-String (instruction manual)</div><div>-Opening &amp; Closing The Claw</div><div>-Assembling The Conveyor Belt</div><div>-Jumbo Pieces</div><div><br></div><div>String: It is needed for the fishing pole and the crane. Unfortunately, they only give you one box of string. Me, not knowing that took the string for the fishing pole and cut it up, I then trimmed it and threw the leftovers away. I then reach the crane and have to scavenge through the trash for the string which was too short, the crane could therefore not reach the cargo on &nbsp;the ship. So Lego should say that the string box must be used in two different spots.</div><div><br></div><div>Opening &amp; Closing The Claw: It is also a pain because you have to manually do that. Lego could have, although, made a scooper to pick up and transport the cargo.</div><div><br></div><div>Assembling The Conveyor Belt: The conveyor belt only turns one way but both sides are symmetrical so when i assembled it, it turned the wrong way so I had to take it apart and flip it. To make the set better, the belt could have been labeled better.</div><div><br></div><div>Jumbo Pieces: I am&nbsp;starting&nbsp;to feel that Lego is becoming&nbsp;Playmobile because the pieces keep on getting bigger, not a large problem but still bothersome.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall I am very happy with this set!</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"stagus","2011-08-30T08:36:15.907Z","Good set with good playability although a bit expensive at full price","<p>This is a good set, not brilliant but very good.&nbsp; I picked it up for just under £50 which makes it good value.&nbsp; At £72 I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the build but, as in the other review, it should be made clear to keep the string once you have cut it for the fishing rod (fortunately I throw nothing away until I am finished with the build!).&nbsp; This set fits very well in my city so I am pleased with it from that aspect.&nbsp; As a standalone set it is quite straightforward to build - although please note that parental assistance may be needed with the crane and conveyor - and has a lot of playability.&nbsp; You can bring the grain ship into the harbour, unload via the crane to the conveyor and then onto the lorry before driving off.&nbsp; Or you can always go for a bit of fishing off the end of the pier.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nice colours 
<li>Good build 
<li>Smart lorry 
<li>Playability is good 
<li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>A couple of tricky bits in the build 
<li>Not sure how much variety you can have in the set to build different models 
<li>Full price is a bit expensive 
<li>…</li></ul>
<p>All in all a good addition to any city particularly when combined with railways, etc but I would try to pick it up at sale price (I know that is a bit of an obvious statement but it takes the set from expensive to good value in the space of £20). Hope this helps :)).</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"aplbomr79","2011-10-31T01:24:49.683Z","Adequate build; horrible playability factor.","Building is Strong; Playability is Lacking.<div><br></div><div>I purchased this set for my boy's birthday. &nbsp;I was sorely disappointed after the build. &nbsp;Please read further to understand my sentiments...</div><div><br></div><h4>Ship</h4><div>The Ship was an easy build. &nbsp;Nothing new in the ways of a normal LEGO build. &nbsp;The one thing that I found degrading was the fact that the Hull of the ship was one piece. &nbsp;As another reviewer put it, it felt like I was dealing with Playmobil. &nbsp;C'mon LEGO, where are the hard-body, multi-piece vessels that we know and love? &nbsp;The rest of the ship build was nothing out of the ordinary - it was very bland. &nbsp;But I did love the Captain's Quarters.</div><div><br></div><h4>Transport Truck</h4><div>I loved that LEGO kept with the 6-stud-wide truck. &nbsp;The tipper aspect and the unique build that it contained is great. &nbsp;The red cab and truck will fit in seamlessly with my burgeoning city-scape.</div><div><br></div><h4>Receiving Yard</h4><div>This build was less than average. &nbsp;The final product is absolutely disgusting. &nbsp;There are pieces that could have lent to a great build, but those great pieces were overshadowed by a disgraceful product. &nbsp;This portion of the set rendered the entirety of the set useless in terms of playability. &nbsp;I have already deconstructed the Yard and created a new, more viable yard for my boys to play with. &nbsp;LEGO faltered on this portion.</div><div><br></div><h4>Crane</h4><div>The crane build was great. &nbsp;The build is nearly immaculate. &nbsp;I love how it is multi-operational and is operated to release and&nbsp;retrieve&nbsp;the jaws. &nbsp;The jaws are a bit lack-luster, but are easy to operate. &nbsp;However, the biggest problem is how the Crane is mated to the infrastructure. &nbsp;And this is horrendous. &nbsp;Every time one attempts to operate the crane, it falls off it's base. &nbsp;I will continue to lay blame on the design of the Receiving Yard...</div><div><br></div><h4>Conveyer Belt</h4><div>Another great build... I truly enjoyed how the parts were engineered. &nbsp;It is very much akin to a TECHNIC build. &nbsp;The parts alone lend to many other great MOC's. &nbsp;However, the mating to the Receiving Yard absolutely sucks in terms of playability. &nbsp;It falls off at every crank of the shaft.</div><div><br></div><h4>Mini-Figs</h4><div>Great Mini-Figs that can find a home in any City-Scape. &nbsp;There should have been at least one more Fig that aids in the vessel. &nbsp;However, this does not detract anymore from the score that I have given for the set.</div><div><br></div><h4>Accessories</h4><div>There are some great accessories that will aid in your City-Scape. &nbsp;There is the new fishing pole, a broom, a shovel, and numerous fish to add to your local market.</div><h4>Final Word</h4><div>For a stagnant set, it is great. &nbsp;If you wish not to touch this after it is built, it is&nbsp;phenomenal. &nbsp;However, I did not purchase this set to sit on a shelf. &nbsp;I purchased it to be played with. &nbsp;For that it gets a 3 out of 5 stars... and that is only due to the add-ons.</div>",TRUE,2,4,3,1,3
"av8r1973","2011-12-10T03:41:05.427Z","Good addition if you need a place to park boats/ships, not so good to play with","I held off purchasing this one until I was able to see the pics. &nbsp;I liked the looks of the prior harbor set, but thought this one would be better. &nbsp;It wasn't, but the old one was too expensive by this point.<div><br></div><div>As another review points out, the dockside building is less than attractive, not a fun build, and doesn't really add much. &nbsp;It does have a good industrial look to it, complete with a rat and a bucket of fish. &nbsp;The big wall plates are a real drawback and lead to a flimsy build. &nbsp;There are half-rooms and places to put stuff, but I'm not sure what the design intent was supposed to be, but it doesn't look finished.</div><div><br></div><div>Another not so nice part of the kit is the ""ship"". &nbsp;It's strange that the cargo ship is the same length as the police boat and the coast guard ship. &nbsp;I was hoping for a new hull that was either brick-built or large enough to pass as a ship.</div><div><br></div><div>With the negatives out of the way, the rest is good. &nbsp;I promise. &nbsp;The captain's quarters and rigging on the ship are nice touches. &nbsp;The separate cargo holds are also nice for different cargo types. &nbsp;I would like to have seen sliding covers, rather than removable ones, but that's just a nice-to-have.</div><div><br></div><div>The truck was a pleasant build. The chassis is well-designed and thought out. &nbsp;The tipper bed is nice, too. &nbsp;The scale fits nicely with the rest of the City collection.</div><div><br></div><div>The minifigs are good, but I think one too few. &nbsp;A deck hand would have been a welcome addition. &nbsp;The fishing pole and extra fish are nice touches. The mini-lighthouse is cool, too.</div><div><br></div><div>The crane is great. &nbsp;It's well-balanced, technically fun to build and looks great when complete. &nbsp;It's adjustable and works well to grab cargo out of the ship. &nbsp;I recall the bucket from an older kit I had as a kid, but it does the job nicely here.</div><div><br></div><div>The conveyor belt was a nice touch and was fun to build. &nbsp;Both of my daughters like playing with it, but it makes the building come apart if you move it much.</div><div><br></div><div>So, it's a good set to have if you are developing a waterfront in your City. &nbsp;Not so good if you're looking for a set to play with. &nbsp;Hope this helps folks decide if they really want this set.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
"What_Sup_Lego_Fans","2011-12-23T23:16:35.75Z","4645-Harbour ----- Marina is way better!","<p>Today I am going to be reviewing the 4645 Harbour. It comes with 551 pieces and 4 minifigures. This is a&nbsp;disappointing set. Lets find out why.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box is big. The back of the box shows you a lot of features about the boat like the conveyor belt and the crane. As a kid, the string part was a little hard to build since I have never touched with strings in Lego. Other than that it was a average build.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are big pieces in this set. This is why the price per piece is high. Many parts are useful for your city since the pieces are big and uncommon. &nbsp;</p><h4><b>Minifigures</b></h4><div>One of the disappointing things about this set is the minifigures. You only get 4 minifigures for a $170 Nz Dollars set. The Police Minifigure Collection (7279) has 4 minifigures for a lot cheaper price. There should be at least 6 so you can have more playability.</div><h4>The Completed Model</h4><div>It comes with a dock, a small truck and the boat. The crane and the conveyor belt are some exciting parts but the build for those things can be hard.</div><h4>Suggestions for next time.</h4><div><ul><li>Include 6 or more minifigures rather than 4.</li><li>Find a better way to collect the grain because this crane cant collect much grain.</li><li>Find a better way to do the stairs at the back of the boat.</li><li>Include more fish so their is a better chance of catching fish.</li><li>Include a bridge rather than a dock so their can be more playability.</li><li>Use cargo rather than grain so there can be a much bigger boat.</li><li>Think about the old 7994.</li></ul><h4>Rating - 4/10</h4></div>",TRUE,2,4,2,4,2
"weirdbricks","2015-12-27T13:11:26.413Z","Why harbour? ","<p>When I furst baught this set I was super Lucky! I thought I could have hours of building. But it took me around one and a half hour.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box have a nice looking back that shows the set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I Think its better to part out this set! Very common pieces in the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Could have a lot more minifigures. At least 6!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Ok but very desepointing! &nbsp;Thought i would use 4-5 hours, but it took me around one and a half hour.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This does not look like an harbour!&nbsp;this looks like a construction site&nbsp;with a random boat!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Not a very bad set but for the price I Think its not worth it!</p>
