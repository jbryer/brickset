"Niallskie","2011-06-02T22:44:07.707Z","Collecting exclusive minifigures as we go.","<p>Just got this set from our local lego store down in Portland. At first I just came in to buy some bricks, but when I was on my way out, I&nbsp;saw that the new HP sets are out. I was able to get this set and 4866, no budget yet for 4867 LOL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was very very easy, it is to be expected just by looking at the picture on the box. This is more of like a SW battle pack but better, you get to have HP minifigures that are exclusives only to some sets. Minifigures like Hagrid and Voldemort, as well as Narcissa being exclusive to this set. Took me just a couple of minutes to build the tree, it was alright and nothing really special about it. It was fun though that they still put the contraption that flips Harry when he stands beside the tree. The blue flames are awesome as well, other than that it a typical set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its nice to know that Lego is puting 4 minifigures again in a 11.99 set, and to top it all they are not just monotonus figures like soldiers or clones or something.&nbsp;Since when do we get to have lead characters in a small package for a very good price? Now I guess.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"AETerry","2011-06-16T12:05:42.953Z","Forbidden Forest Review","<p>At around $12 roughly, you've got a very good LEGO set offering up 4 minifigures and a Tree build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes it good are that 3 of the 4 minifigures are either exclusive, such as Narcissa or they're rare and the only other sets to get them in are expensive such as Hagrid and Voldemort. The detail work for the minfigures, including Harry Potter himself are very good. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tree build, which helps to re-enact a LEGO based scene from the last book is fairly quick and easy to build. Worth it all the same as most of the tree builds like this that I have are from the 90's and were often just a solid black tree, not much brown. Then you've got blue spell fire that used to hold Hagrid prisoner while Harry faces off against Narcissa and Voldemort. Two small animal pieces of a spider and green snake finish out this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those on a budget, this set fits into the range of affordability for Harry Potter sets and being able to get some of the harder to get or come by minifigures too.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,5

Narcissa Malfoy is exclusive- great hair, face, and an awesome dress-, Voldemort is only in one other set (that costs $130), Hagrid is also somewhat rare-ish, and Harry... well... nothing special there. Another Gryffyndor torso though!

That'd be epic.))<br><br>Accessories: 5/5<br><br>FOUR NEW BLUE fire! -those three capitalized words mean a lot to me. The new fire piece is great- LEGO got rid of those annoying (though sometimes useful) things at the bottom of the piece. There are also a lot of Dark Brown slopes and arches. I definitely like the tree.<br><br>Build: 4.5/5<br><br>Not much to build, but as I said, I like the tree.<br><br>Playability: 3.5/5<br><br>Not a ton to play with. I don't think I even bothered to try the lever function before I dismantled it, but I'm sure it works fine. Other than that, you can just move the 'figs and mutter random spells.<br><br>Summary:<br><br>In my opinion it was definitely worth my money. Voldemort is my new favorite minifig, and the set comes with a lot of great pieces.

"brickboy001","2011-06-29T12:10:08.79Z","Better than a Star Wars battle pack!","<p>This set is possibly the smallest but one of the best Harry Potter sets I own, it is far more better than a Star Wars battlepack because you get two figures from each side not to mention they are all pretty rare figures apart from Narcissa because she is exclusive to this set, and you get a Harry in every set :/ but at least i can make more hogwarts students! The actual tree is quite simple to build but looks great it comes with awesome accessories such as a mushroom, spider and snake not to mention the blue flames representing the petrificus Totalus spell to keep Hagrid prisoner?

Quicker and easier than falling asleep"" - Harry Potter and Sirius Black","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The smallest 2011 Lego Harry Potter set contains no secrets. You can really see exactly what you're going to get from the picture. There is a&nbsp;minuscule&nbsp;play feature and you can reenact the alleged death of Harry Potter. However, lack of Death Eaters and trees make it a slightly unrealistic reenactment.<div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Nevertheless, the set isn't that bad. Or maybe my intense love of the Harry Potter series is guiding my thoughts on this set. In this set you get four minifigures and one exclusive minifigure.</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigures:</h4><div><br></div><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>Harry Potter - </b>&nbsp;This is the standard Harry Potter. He has thick black hair and a double-sided head. On one side of his face he is frowning, the other he is smiling. He has a Gryffindor uniform on with a blue shirt and Gryffindor tie underneath. He gets a brown wand to hold and black pants. My complaint with this minifigure is the inaccuracy to the actual book/movie. The same complaint goes to the Hogwarts set also released in 2011. Harry never wears his Gryffindor uniform in Deathly Hallows. He only has Muggle (non-magic) clothing. My collection of standard Harry Potter is growing.</p><p><br></p><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>Hagrid - </b>This is a specially made minifigure. His body is all one piece with non-movable feat and long arms. He is wearing a brown coat. He has wild black hair and a beard that covers most of his face. Underneath is a smiling face that looks rather creepy without the beard. I feel that Hagrid should have gotten a double-sided face with a frown as this is not a happy scene.</p><p><br></p><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>Lord Voldemort - </b>I think one major reason people got this was to get Voldemort in a cheap set. Voldemort is only available in the Hogwarts Castle set which is 120 dollars. Voldemort has black pants and black robes on. He has a black cloak as well and a white wand. His head is white with dark, sunken eyes and hollowed cheeks. He's grinning and you can his teeth. He also has slits for a nose. Voldemort is one of my favorite minifigures in the whole Harry Potter Lego line because of his uniqueness.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>Narcissa Malfoy - </b>Narcissa is the exclusive minifigure in this set. Now you have all the members of the Malfoy family! But not all the members of the Weasley family....Anyways, Narcissa has a black, elaborate dress with gray details and a silver buckle. She has a dress piece. She also has a black wand. She is double-sided. She has thin brown eyebrows and details to show age. One face is neutral, the other is a little hard to describe. She's baring her teeth in...shock? Anger? Surprise? I don't know. Her hair is mostly brown, but also has some kind of dark tan color, or maybe gray. I can't tell. Part of her hair drapes over her torso. All in all, a good figure.</p><p><br></p><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Tree</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This tree has no real value, really it's just a random tree. I suppose it's only significant because Hagrid was trapped here. It is a small tree with dark wood and dark green leaves up top. There is a spider living on top of the tree. Down below on the base plate you have your play feature. Besides a nice spotted mushroom, a&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;piece hangs from the tree. You can put Harry on a couple pieces by this&nbsp;Technic piece and flick the piece to make him fly forward, showing him 'dying'. It's a nice feature, but a little pointless. It can be difficult to make Harry move at all sometimes.</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>On the other side of the tree there is a space for Hagrid to stand, surrounded by blue fire. I like this better than the original way Hagrid was trapped in the book because it is more magical. Also, Lego would've had a tough time showing rope wrapped around Hagrid.</div><div><br></div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Overall</h4><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>It's a decent set.

"Berrus_Brickus","2011-08-17T12:07:54.597Z","4865 Narcissa Malfoy and the Forbidden Tree","<p>Before I start, I would just like to say: <strong>THERE IS NO REASON TO MARK THIS REVIEW AS UNHELPFUL JUST BECAUSE YOU DO NOT APPRECIATE HARRY POTTER, REVIEWS WRITTEN BY TFOLS, OR REVIEWS WHICH USE PICTURES</strong></p>
<p>I ordered this along with 4865 and 4867 from <a href=""mailto:Shop@Home""><FONT color=#4667a4>Shop@Home</FONT></a> on June 30th and it arrived on the 6th of July. I would of been disappointed with the arrival date, if I hadn't been out of town from the 31st until the 6th, as it only used to take three to four days rather than a whole week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though this scene has not been adapted into LEGO before, we have had a model of the same part of the Forbidden Forest. [img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4727-1.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>It wasn't explained in the movie, but in the book this was the same location.</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4865-1.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Because they are not the same scene, I won't compare them (but that tree behind Aragog looks very familiar).</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Here's the box:</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4865-0000-xx-23-1.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>The back of the box explains how to flick Harry a couple inches and gives another view of the tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The instruction art on the cover is the same as the box.&nbsp; The back of the instructions has the random kid screaming against a black/yellow-green background.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>12.99 for 64 pieces isn't exactly a great deal, but as I am sure I will say again, you get this set for the minifigures, and not the parts (except for maybe the mushroom and blue flames).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onto the actual parts we have, a dark tan plate, some dark brown arches, four trans. light blue flames, a spider, green snake (Nagini?), a mushroom, and some dark green foliage. There are no stickers</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set includes four minifigures, the excluisve Narcissa Malfoy, the rare Hagrid and Voldemort, and another Harry.</p>
<p><strong>Harry Potter</strong></p>
<p>This is the original Harry Potter minifigure released back in 2001</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp005.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Not very good, but it has an advantage over the others, the inclusion of a black cape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the redesigned Harry Potter minifigure released in 2005/2007</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp086.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Better face than the other two, dark gray is better for Hogwarts robes, the stripe is nice, but it lacks a cape and Gryffindor Badge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the current Harry Potter minifigure released in 2010</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp094.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Not a very good Happy face, but there is a frown on the other side, Gryffindor Robes have the stripe, the badge, and&nbsp;new back printing.&nbsp;The black legs also work better than the gray ones and are more movie accurate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hagrid</strong></p>
<p>There have been three variations for the Hagrid figure since the first in 2001</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the original from 2001</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp009.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the flesh redesign from 2004</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp061.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Exactly the same as the predecessor, but with movable hands and a flesh tone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the current variation from 2010</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp111.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>This one has a redesigned face and body print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Voldemort</strong></p>
<p>There have been three variations for the Voldemort figure since the first in 2001</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the original from 2001</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp011.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>It was on the back of the Professor Quirell minifigure's head (Trivia: Professor Quirell was the first minifigure to have a double sided head), it doesn't really look like Voldemort, but it fits in with the design of the other 2001 figures, just look at the yellow Harry and Hagrid above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the redesign from 2005</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp069.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Horrible, absolutely horrible, they obvioulsy took the old face (which didn't look like Voldemort in the first place), changed the colors a little, and put it an a glow-in-the-dark-head.&nbsp; The dementor cloak is also too big to fit on a normal figure (the new dementor cloaks fit though).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the current variation from 2010</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp098.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Much better! And the best part is, it actually <em>looks </em>like Voldemort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Narcissa Malfoy</strong></p>
<p>The first Narcissa Malfoy is exclusive to this set</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp126.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>She's a nice figure, but I have two problems with her:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Her dress print is off centered, so it doesn't match the great torso print. 
<li>2. Her hair is great, but in the movie, it always seemed to be black and blonde rather than brown and blonde.&nbsp; Also, there was more than two blonde streaks.</li></ul>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>It's a tree, nothing special, you get a set like this for the minifigures.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Not exactly a forest, and it doesn't resemble the scene in the movie which was a clearing surronded by dark, tall trees (like on the box) with Hagrid tied being held with rope. This set really isn't much, but it does go nicely next to last year's&nbsp;<em>Hagrid's Hut.</em></p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>I would just like to list a few interesting aspects of the set:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Harry was dressed casualy in this scene 
<li>2. Hagrid was held with a rope (in the movie) or a spider web (in the book), not blue flames</li></ul>
<p>Alright, if your a Harry Potter fan, I would recomned this set for the figures.&nbsp; If not, I would recomend it for some of the parts, (mushroom,&nbsp;spider, blue flames, Narcissa's Hair, Voldemort's Cape, etc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for Narcissa having a small picture, I found it on Brickipedia unlike the other which were taken by Huw.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2012-01-21T17:12:48.277Z","Forbidden Forest? More Like Forbidden Tree","<p>Set #4865 The Forbidden Forest: This set is OK, but it isn't exactly a full on Forest. I can understand though why LEGO made this set the way they did, a full on set of The Forbidden Forest complete with Unicorns, Centaurs and Acromantulas probably wouldn't have been very cost effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model included with this set is a simple and easily built tree on an interesting base plate, the tree is the main bulk of the model, but there are also a few blue flame parts to use to keep Hagrid trapped and a small mushroom. It features a flick-fire Mini-Figure launcher gimmick using technic pieces, the gimmick is added play value in a pretty basic set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures included in the set really bump up the value, first of all is the standard Harry Potter, with same basic head with double-sided printing and the double-sided torso with his school uniform on it. Black pants, a brown wand and the Harry Potter hairpiece. Secondly you get the newer made Hagrid, with a single solid torso/legs combination piece, he's pretty nice looking with a great head printing, some of it is covered up a little by his hairpiece, but all-in-all I'd say it's a much better looking Hagrid than the old yellow faced version I used to own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third Mini-Figure included in this is the rarer, but no less numerous Lord Voldemort figure, with a really nice looking head printing, very evil looking, a great torso print, his pet snake Nagini, his personal white wand&nbsp;and a flowing black cape. And the final Mini-Figure in this set, is a rare one of a kind Mini-Figure that has never been seen before. Narcissa Malfoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She has a really impressive looking printed torso that continues seamlessly into the lower body brick piece, she includes a two-toned hair piece, brown and white, as well as a double-sided head print. One neutral expression, the other grimacing and angry looking. Her wand is a black lightsaber piece. She is well worth the price of this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to the equally priced Freeing Dobby set you get a lot more out of this set at that price point, at least this one includes 4 Mini-Figures like the Battle Packs that it is emulating from the Star Wars and other Themes. You get Lord Voldemort for a very good price and Narcissa Malfoy with some really unique pieces and printing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd recommend this set much stronger than the Freeing Dobby set, true you have less pieces than that set, but the 4 Mini-Figures really gives you more value with this set. A cheap way to get Voldemort and the only way to get the final member of the Malfoy family.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4

To be honest Voldemort being one of my favourite villians I jumped at the chance to get him in a set for only £10.49 and as&nbsp;I had money left over after my birthday&nbsp;I just decided to buy this for Voldemort.&nbsp;I must say&nbsp;I was pleasantly suprised as this was my first 2010-2011 set of Harry Potter, the box art was top notch and the set itself is great.</p>
<p>Minifigs: Harry Potter dressed in his uniform&nbsp;I was slightly disappointed at this as in this particular scene he was wearing a jacket and his face was covered in scars as Harry is in every set I thought they could have at least given us another variation but oh well it is my first Harry. He is quite detailed 5/10. However the stand out figure is Voldy the face captures Ralph Fiennes portrayal of Voldemort and the robe is very well detailed. Yes in the film it was completeley dark green but I quite like the feel of it also as Voldemort ""spoiler"" had Dumbledore's wand in the movie his wand should have been tan rather than his usual white wand voldemort 10/10. Another very detailed figure is Narcissa Malfoy who as some of you who watch the films know is&nbsp;Draco's mum although the printing on the skirt is slightly off compared to her torso she is definitley a good portrayal of the character so 8/10 and Hagrid looks the same as in the other two sets apart from the absence of his umbrella.</p>
<p>The build was quite simple as it is just a tree to be quite clear and the mechanism is cleverly hidden behind it. In the set there is a play feature to launch your Harry minifig across the table etc which works much better than the mechanism in freeing Dobby which&nbsp;I have seen round a friend's house as it launches Harry further and is funnier to watch especialy if you have a figure you don't like eg Elisabeth Swann you can launch Harry at her/him. All in all it is a great set and is definitely worth the price for the minifigs however if you have the castle already unless you are buying it for Narcissa and Hagrid and the tree then give this a miss however if you want Voldemort (like me)then buy this overall I would rate this 8/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,2,5
"LegoMunchy88","2011-08-08T12:05:47.95Z","Great Way to get Voldemort.....","<p>LEGO The Forbidden Forest is a good set, with great minifigs and some pretty rare pieces, such as blue fire and the mushroom. It also includes Narcissa Malfoy, who is exclusive to this set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>
<p>Harry Potter: We (once again) see a Harry Potter, and I'm begging for someone to prove me wrong and tell me that a set exists in the Harry Potter remake theme without a Harry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hagrid: Hagrid has only been in this, Hagrid's Hut, and Diagon Alley, so this is a very welcome minifigure that isn't in every set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narcissa Malfoy: She's exclusive, and of course it's fun to have an exclusive minifigure, but I do wish that the design on her dress and her torso lined up. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voldemort: Easily the best minifigure of the set, and only available in this and Hogwarts. He looks great, and so much better that the weird looking thing in Graveyard Duel, which I do have, and the new one is much better. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>
<p>The set, minus the minifigures, is a tree. That's right. A tree. There's much to say otherwise than the fact that the tree is well built, includes a rare mushroom piece, and some cool blue fire that Hagrid can be trapped in. The final feature is a firing mechanism that involes a technic bar and the tree. When you place the figure in front of it and flick it forward, it hits the figure, sending him or her flying forward. (Possibly the defeat of Voldemort, although that actually happened at Hogwarts)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>Overall, LEGO 4865 The Forbidden Forest is almost like a battle pack. You get great figs, but the scenery is sort of a let down. This reminds me of a set I reviewed earlier today, 7101 Lightsaber Duel. The set is nice, has great figs, but the scenery is pretty bad. The Forbidden Forest is a very imposing place in the Harry Potter books and films, and LEGO has made a tree. Maybe it would have been better to name this set, ""The Tree"", and call it a day. </p>

"tkettle9719","2012-01-01T21:53:52.96Z","""The Boy Who Lived...come to die.""-Tom Riddle, Jr.","<p>I got this set for full price at the Lego Store nearest me, and find it to be one of the best buys I've ever made. For twelve dollars, this set has playability, <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-This set comes with Voldemort, Mrs. Malfoy, and Hagrid- all for under 20 dollars.<br></li><li>-The tree has the gloominess of night and story because of the dark pieces on the tree- an excellent setting-setter.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Another Harry- That's a problem, but Lego really shows its true flaw by putting him in Hogwarts uniform. <br></li><li>-Hagrid was tied down by ropes in the movie; though fire is a good solution, it's not movie accurate. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a great minifigure set, and the submodel is actually not that bad. I recommend it to all Harry Potter fans, especially because of its low price.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-19T07:58:42.41Z","LEGO Harry Potter - The Forbidden Forest Review","<p>This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some really good pieces. We get a lot of brown and tan pieces which are always great to have for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has a nice value for minifigs as well. We get another Harry Potter, the first Narzissa Malfoy and we also get Hagrid and Voldemort. This set is also the cheapest way to get this version of Hagrid and Voldemort, too.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/4865-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set doesn't have a lot of play features but it's still fun! On one side is a LEGO Technic piece which you can use to make the scene where Harry dies in the 7th movie and on the other side are 4 blue flame pieces which surround Hagrid. I really can't complain about this set.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
