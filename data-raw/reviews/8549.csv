I built the 4865 first then quickly move&nbsp;along to building this set,&nbsp;I have always wanted to have&nbsp;the old&nbsp;knight bus... and now I have one. :D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was actually alright, not really hard and technical but it works and it ends up really fantastic. I have build a bunch of lego card but i do believe the build on the front portion of the Knight Bus is simplistically unique. Not too sure but I think the curved purple&nbsp;lego piece that acts as a bridge for the back tires are new, as well as the brick with two pegs on each side and smooth middle (1x4 piece), that is usually used for the roof and the connecting for the upper decks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also love the bed or floor element,&nbsp;that keps sliding back and forth at the Bus moves. What more with the chandelier that swings back and forth, just like in the movies :D . The idea and the execution of the chandelier using usual lego bricks works fantastic for this set. Extra seats for the upper decks are alright but would be fine without them. Just wondering why those seats were not used for the actual driving area?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is nothing but awesome and im 100% sure HP fans will love this. Oh and just two small stickers! How can you not love this set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ordered this along with 4865 and 4867 from&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:Shop@Home"">Shop@Home</a> on&nbsp;June 30th and it arrived on the 6th of July.&nbsp; I would of been disappointed&nbsp;with the arrival date, if I hadn't been out of town from the 31st until the 6th, as it only used&nbsp;to take three to four days rather than a whole week.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the second LEGO minifigure-scale model of the Knight Bus.&nbsp; The first was released back in 2004 with the Prisoner of Azkaban wave.&nbsp; I believe that the reason we got&nbsp;the Knight Bus as a set&nbsp;rather than say, Malfoy Manor, is because LEGO loves to make veichles, which Hp really isn't full of.&nbsp; As we got the Hogwarts Express and Flying Ford&nbsp;last year, the next most memorable veichle would&nbsp;probably be the purple, triple-decker&nbsp;Knight Bus complete with talking Shrunken Head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&nbsp;are pictures of the set and its predecessor.</p>
<p><strong>Current</strong></p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4866-1.jpg[/img]</p>
<p><strong>Original</strong></p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4755-1.jpg[/img]</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The front of the box and instruction booklet is the Knight Bus speeding down a London street.&nbsp; In the corner of the box, there is parchment square in the lower right-hand corner which shows the three minifigures, and also gives the French names for Ernie and Stan. One thing I find interesting about the box is that Harry and Hedwig (the snowy owl) seem to be floating, there is no floor below Harry, and Hedwig is not that tall.&nbsp; On the top of the box there is a 1:1 image of Harry, Stan, and Ernie.&nbsp; On the back is the normal parchment background, with another view of the bus, play features, and accessories. On the back of the instruction manual, we have the normal <em>WIN!</em> advertisement with some random kid screaming at you.&nbsp; Not very attractive at all.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>According to the box, there are 281 pieces, which would be more ideal for a $30 set.&nbsp; The majority of the pieces are purple, but black and transparent are also widely used.&nbsp; Brown, gray, tan, white, and blue are also used in the chasis and in some of the furniture.&nbsp; Hedwig is also included, and I think this is the cheapest set to get her in (save for the promotional&nbsp;Trolley). There is also and exclusive Shrunken Head from the movie adaptions, which on the previous Knight Bus was only a sticker on the window.&nbsp; There is also a chest for holding two included printed sock tiles.&nbsp; Only Harry has a wand, which is understandable, but it would be nice if Stan did.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set includes three minifigures: The standard Harry Potter, a redesigned Stan Shunpike, and the all new Ernie Prang.&nbsp; Unless I have something to say that I feel is necessary, I will let the pictures do the talking (mostly because I accidently erased this review earlier).</p>
<p><strong>Harry Potter:</strong></p>
<p>Original</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp059.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Goblet of Fire Redesign</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp086.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Current</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp087.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>The latest variation has back printing (a blue stripe on the back of his jacket) and a double sided head happy/angry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stan Shunpike:</strong></p>
<p>Original</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/hp047.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Current</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/215px-stan.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>The new Stan Shunpike also had back printing, which continues the brown strap on his back.&nbsp; I really do hate the new face that Stan has, because he is supposed to be young and pimply, whereas his face is borrowed from a more generic, middle-aged character, the Cook from PotC.&nbsp; I would actually prefer that they just reuse either Bruce Wayne's or Mutt Williams' heads.</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/poc013.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ernie Prang:</strong></p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/215px-ernieprang.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Ernie has back printing, which continues the design on the back of his jacket.&nbsp; He really is a great figure, but I was a little disappointed with mine, because I found that looking closely on his head, there are a few thin, stray, black lines around his eyes.</p>
<p>In a set of this size, I wouldn't normally say that it is a problem that there are only three minifigures, but considering that the smallest set in the wave has one more, I would have to say that it would be nice if Sirius Black was included, or the grim at least.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Nothing really stand-out, save for the front, which as an Adventurers fan, I must say will probably be useful.&nbsp; The build itself is mostly just purple bricklaying once you complete the chasis, but it is fun to build with purple as a dominant color for a change.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The Completed model is just as it looks in the pictures.&nbsp; It has two play features.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. As the bus moves, the chandelier will swing back and forth 
<li>2. As the bus moves, the bed will slide from behind Ernie's seat to the back of the bus</li></ul>
<p>I would of liked another 1x4x3 window (with corresponding glass) to put to Ernie's right, because otherwise it is empty.&nbsp; It would of also been nice if there were more seats on the top floor, because only one doesn't really feel complete.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Really a nice set in my opinion, but I do&nbsp;have a few fixes above in the <strong>Completed Model</strong> section.&nbsp; Ernie and the Shrunken head are really great and the whole set could be used to compliment <em>10217 Diagon </em>AlleyI would recomned picking this up while it lasts, even if it is just for parts, because&nbsp;who knows when the next time a LEGO set will have so many purple parts as this one does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for Ernie and Stan having small photos, I found them on Brickipedia and they were not taken by Huw as the other minifigure photos were.</p>

"xccj","2011-12-10T17:26:07.797Z","So Much Purple!!","<font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

</font><p><span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9.5pt;"">I missed out on the first
release of Harry Potter sets, and thus I never got the original Knight Bus.
When I heard that a new version was being released, I got excited for it. But
upon finding the first pictures, I was put off, because the bulk of the bus seems
to be made out of window pieces, and it didn't seem to have the same amount of
purple bricks as the previous version. However, today I managed to get it on
sale, and was pleasantly surprised with the set.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /><o:p></o:p></span></p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

</font><p><span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9.5pt;""></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9.5pt;"">First off, I'll touch on
the minifigures. It comes with three; Harry in Muggle garb, Ernie the driver,
and Stan. Harry is pretty basic; he's wearing a blue jacket again, which isn't
anything new. Ernie is in a grey suit, and he has a bearded face with glasses.
Stan is in his purple uniform, with some device strapped around his shoulders,
and has a purple cap. Overall, the three figs aren't bad, but they're nothing
to get excited about. (Unless you're looking for purple minifig parts.) The set
also comes with Hedwig, the white owl, which is a neat addition. (Even though
in the book, Harry didn't have his owl but just her owl cage... but I digress.)
Oh, and the shrunken head comes printed on a sand green round brick, for those
of you who like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

</font><p><span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9.5pt;""></span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9.5pt;"">Next, the parts. This is
what excited me the most. There are a lot of purple parts here. Sure, to be
fair, there are 18 large window pieces and 6 small window pieces, and they do
make the bulk of the bus. However, there are also plenty of 1x1, 2x1, and 4x1
purple bricks hidden around in this set. This makes the set a great grab for
mosaic builders, as you'll get plenty of purple bricks out of it. The set also
comes with a healthy dose of black tiles and plates, as well as lots of the 1x4
tile with pegs on either end.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9.5pt;""><o:p></o:p></span>&nbsp;</p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

</font><p><span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9.5pt;"">The overall construction
is rather unimpressive. As I mentioned before, most of the bus is made up by
the window pieces, and the rest of the pieces merely build the frames that hold
the windows together. The front of the bus does use some cool techniques using
flag pieces, a 6 long tube, and clips, which give it a nice look. But mostly
the bus is bricks stacked on top of plates, which lacks creativity but is still
practical.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9.5pt;""><o:p></o:p></span>&nbsp;</p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

</font><p><span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9.5pt;"">The main play feature with
this bus (besides the spinning wheels) is that you can separate the various
floors. The bottom floor has room for Ernie the driver and a bed, which isn't
pegged down so it can move back and forth as the bus rolls along. (This is not
a flaw, because that's how it is in the movies / books.) The second and third
levels are mostly empty, with a single seat in the front of each and a storage
area in the back of each. The center space is left opened for the chandelier,
which hangs from the ceiling and can swing back and forth. This does limit the
amount of passengers the bus can take, but it is a nice bit of detail. If you
really don't like this, you could remove the chandelier entirely, and then use
plates from your own collection to fill the gaps.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9.5pt;""><o:p></o:p></span>&nbsp;</p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

</font><p><span style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9.5pt;"">Overall, this set turns
out to be worth more than I thought it would be. It is a fair representation of
the vehicle from the books and movies, and has decent playability. And it comes
with a large amount of purple pieces, many of which are useful. (And I suppose
the many window pieces too could be useful for the right builder.) The base
price of USD $34.99 is a little on the high side, so I would recommend waiting
to find it on sale. But if you're a fan of Harry Potter (or purple pieces) then
this is a good purchase.<o:p></o:p></span></p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman"">

A mark of a great minifig is personality; when you look at the fig you should be able to feel like you could have a conversation with them, and Ernie certainly has that. Stan is pretty cool too in his swanky purple vest and cap. Normally I'm not a fan of the cap piece but on Stan it works great. His face is a little off though, it's too mature and not pimply enough, and I always feel like he should be holding something.

"thejoker34","2012-08-18T12:15:52.49Z","Welcome to the Knight Bus!","Ever since I saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I've loved the sequence in which Harry is picked up by the Knight bus and it's crazy kooky driver, Ernie, the hysterically laughing Shrunken Head, and the conductor, Stan Shunpike. I've seen the movie countless times since and still love that opening scene. When I head Lego was making Harry Potter sets, I needed to get my hands on a Knight Bus. Having it here now I can honestly say I'm not dissappointed in any way!<div><br></div><h4>Box and Instructions</h4><div>The box shows the Knight Bus speeding through the London streets. Its pretty nice and will definately catch your eye. The back shows off the model and such. The Instructions were perfect and easy to follow.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigures</h4><div>We get 3 minifigures in this set, and I have to say, I'm quite impressed by the crew of the Knight Bus!</div><div><br></div><div>Before we get to the entertaining characters of the Knight Bus, we must start once again with the character that I now I am quite tired of-Harry Potter! I can't believe I'm saying this, but after so many Harry Potter's and really only two variants (street clothes and Hogwarts uniform) he is getting a bit tiring. This Harry Potter comes with his street clothes and is what you would expect from any set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Stan Shunpike is a great character. He is the young man who welcomes Harry to the Knight Bus. He is great because he is mostly all purple, and truthfully, we don't get a plethora of purple figures. His face has a bit of wrinkles on his cheeks and black eyes. He comes with a purple conductor hat, and has a very detailed torso. It has a tie and a sort of camera looking thing. (maybe it is a camera, I'm not sure) He also has a sort of satchel printed on that stretches around for some back printing. He has non printed pants that are all purple also. I personally love this figure and think he's quite spectacular.</div><div><br></div><div>Ernie, the driver of the Knight Bus is also a spectacular character. His hair is grey and wavy and adds a lot of character to him. His face has lots of grey facial hair, and has his glasses printed on, similar to Harry Potter. His torso has a tie and a vest. His vest is also printed on his back. His vest has a surprising amount of detail, and is pretty cool. He has plain, non printed brown pants. He along with Stan are some of the best figures I've gotten in a long time!</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div>Building the Knight Bus was a really fun Build. You build it in 3 sections, and attatch them all at the end. It took about an hour to build, and was quite enjoyable. It was also very easy. To sum up the build, I'd call it one thing...fun!</div><div><br></div><h4>The Completed Model</h4><div>Once I built this, I was very impressed by the set. My expectations were exceeded! Its a great model just to look at! The bottom layer has a drivers seat where Ernie sits. It has a printed shrunken head piece to mimic the shrunken head who constantly is laughing and cracking jokes through the scene. The back has a seat where Harry sits, and the very back has the area where Stan stands and hangs on. The middle section has two more platforms, one of which has a seat to look out. Other then that the middle sections doesn't have that much to look out. The top layer is exactly the same, except that it has a chandelier that moves as you drive. The actual car is pretty fun to play with, and its easy enough to break the sections apart to play, but not so easy that it breaks when your driving it around. 35.00 is a pretty good price for this set, but 30 would have been a little better of a price. Overall, it's a very great, detailed and awesome set!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Summary</h4><div>Overall, the Knight Bus is a spectacular set that includes some great minifigures, a nice model, and some fun playability for a decent price. Any fan of Harry Potter in the least should pick this spectacular edition to the Harry Potter line up!

"AETerry","2012-02-07T12:52:16.86Z","Knight Bus Review","<p>I missed the first Knight Bus back in 2004 and decided I'd pick up this version of the model. The Knight Bus is one of the few, iconic scenes &amp; vehicles in Harry Potter in that it's a triple decker bus. It's been awhile since I read the books or watched the movies, but this seems a fairly good interpretation in LEGO brick form of the Knight Bus.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art shows beautifully the Knight Bus moving down a street and is well illustrated what it is you're getting.</p><p>The instructions are in booklet form with step-by-step illustrations for building the bus.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a grand total of 257 pieces, many of which are purple elements and thus uncommon and rare outside of this set. There's then a piece for Hedwig, shrunken head piece, a pair of printed tile pieces for socks and a trunk that Harry is hauling onto the bus.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There's a total of three minifigures in this set. Harry Potter who's fairly common and found in almost all of the Harry Potter sets. Stanley Turnpike and Ernie, the driver. Stanley and Ernie are fairly unique to this set.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The Bus is built in three parts and it also is built in those three parts so you can access each of the different levels of the Knight Bus. Even the very top of the bus' roof comes off. Which compared to much older models from the 80's is a very welcomed feature.<br></p><p>It also follows a very easy, repetitive build for the upper levels that's almost the same. While I wanted to argue about needing more seating inside, much of the space inside is ""hollow"" so the chandelier can hang down to swing back &amp; forth.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In the end, I can't help but feel that this set is almost $5 too much and should have been more towards $30 given the overall piece count and minifigures. But when you figure the Harry Potter license and $3 for minifigure, maybe the $35 makes sense.</p><p>For those who are fans of Harry Potter and missed the first Knight Bus set or just want a newer version, or those MOCers looking for purple pieces in their collection, this set is well worth it and simply beautiful. <br></p><p>I also like that the Knight Bus has an open ended feel to it as I do believe there are a couple places in the books it shows up at so you don't have to be ""stuck"" playing just one time era of the books over another.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"McJoJo_McBob","2012-03-09T22:39:32.87Z","4866-The Knight Bus","I got this set literally 2 hours ago at Barnes &amp; Noble since my friend gave me gift card.This set has way,way more than 150 purple pieces, which a lot of you MOCers will enjoy.I am only 10,and keep all of my sets not used in MOCs.This set is fantastic and very much worth the money,since you get 3 minifigures,2 <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">EXCLUSIVE</span> and the other the cheapest way to get Harry in his dark-blue jacket and wearing black pants.For all of you sticker-haters out there,you will be glad to know that there are only 2 in the whole set.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is very, very, very, very, very, very small for the amount of pieces.I compared it to my Geonosian Cannon box and it isn't even double the size,for more than double the pieces.Anyway,it shows Ernie Prang with the assistance of the Shrunken Head driving the Knight Bus speedily driving down the lamp-lit streets of London as seen in&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> The Prisoner of Azkaban. </span>In the bottom right corner is a piece of parchment made to look like it was stamped on to the box.LEGO just knows us so well don't they?<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">THEY PUT THE NAMES OF THE MINIFIGURES IN FRENCH!!</span>The top of my box says it was made in Enfield, Connecticut.Apparently,Stan Shunpike is also known as Stan Rocade and Ernie Prang is also known as Ernie Danlmur.&nbsp;</p><p>The back is a piece of parchment displaying the set features, which all there is is the bed moving and the floors coming apart for easy play.The minifigure used in the""actual size"" display is everyone in the set, but I'm getting the feeling that they shrunk down Harry's wand.Just because I want to point this out, the side of the advertises LEGO Harry Potter:YEARS 5-7</p><p><br></p><p>The instructions had no mistakes and yet again,no missing pieces.<br></p><p><br></p><h4><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>Parts</h4><p>You guessed it,purple paradise.you get 3 purple arches that are 6 studs long or wide, however you want to be,which,in any color are still pretty rare.You also get <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">18</span> purple 4-stud window frames and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">6 </span>2-stud purple window frames.You also get <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">26</span> purple 1-by-2 stud purple bricks and the rest you can see by looking in the parts list in the digital instructions on Lego.com.</p><p><br></p><h4>Minifigures<br></h4><p>You get as mentioned,3 in this set.You get the&nbsp; all-new, redesigned Stan Shunpike,which has his face,it really looks weird and separates him from his age. He looks like he's 50. Although his torso looks good, has some back printing(his sash) and I'm guessing that the legs could be useful somewhere else, even though I am not a MOCer.</p><p>Next you get the brand new Ernie Prang.There isn't much to say about him. The 1 I own is the 3rd one I've seen in my life,since my friends Ashley and Abi brought there's to school and showed me them(yes,girls can be fans of Harry Potter too(although I am not)). He does have back printing, which is just the pattern on his sweater.He has the same hair piece used on Rolanda Hooch and Count Dooku.He has a lot of facial hair and then wrinkles and his glasses,so you can not really see his skin.</p><p>Now is Harry,in his regular blue jacket.This is the cheapest set to get him in but I got Diagon Alley,so this isn't my first Harry in this outfit.Next,I want to point him out even though he is a minifigure,is the Shrunken Head.he has very nice markings,and he really looks like the Shrunken Head.It's a sand green cylinder brick that has the X-eyes,LEGO tried to print his Bob Marley hair,but didn't do so good.They should have just given him a Snape and left it at that.He does have the little circles on his face,and a stitched-up mouth.</p><p><br></p><h4>The Completed Model</h4><p>The bus drives really smooth,and whoever designed did his homework when he made it so the bed will go through the first floor of the bus when you drive it to a sudden halt.They also made it so you can take apart the bus and play inside on each floor for this little kiddies.This set is very small for 281 pieces, but I am not complaining.It is only 7 studs wide,which means you can put it in the box built without it falling apart.The chandelier you saw on the box will also swing around n the inside,but because of that,the top two floors only have a seat and a little area for luggage each so the chandelier can hang.</p><p><br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, I recommend this set if you are a fan of the LEGO Harry Potter universe, like me,or if you are someone at any age who loves vehicles,because this one moves if you accidentally hit your finger on the third floor.For MOCers,go to you local LEGO store right now to get the rare purple pieces.I just was not wild about the price until I actually got it.See you in my next review!<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
