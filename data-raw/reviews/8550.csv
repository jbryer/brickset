"Greyface","2011-06-08T16:58:59.813Z","The first review!","<p>I purchased this with the Forbidden Forest over LEGO <a href=""mailto:Shop@Home"">Shop@Home</a> - not a good idea, by the way, it came a week later than I would've liked and I do believe they've hiked up their prices. Anyways, the set is fantastic. I'll breakdown the ""floor by floor"" breakdown,&nbsp;minifig evaluation,&nbsp;building experience, parts, playability, value for money, and overall rating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>""Floor by floor"" breakdown</h4>
<p><strong>The Viaduct</strong></p>
<p>In non-geek terms, this is the bridge. The bridge is quite nice, although&nbsp;a little even because of the playability feature. This feature (you turn a knob and fire sends the bridge's pieces flying) doesn't work too well, but it's nice to have anyways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Astronomy Tower</strong></p>
<p>The bottom of this tower is one of two generic dungeons.&nbsp;These dungeons aren't that great, they're bare, not truthful to the books or movies (in both, they were underground rooms like the Potions classroom, not caves) and there's not enough room to stand a minifig in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next floor is the Room of Requirement in ""hospitality"" mode, when Neville and the D.A. hide out from Snape and the Carrows in the seventh book/eighth film. It's got some nice details, and the beds are wonderful, even if they are hammocks in the movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following floor is a film-accurate Astronomy Tower balcony. An Astronomy Tower was previously included in the latest Hogwarts Castle, but it wasn't accurate to the sixth film and included a telescope. It's rather nice to have both, as this one is much closer to the scene of Dumbledore's death, while the other looks like the students could actually be studying Astronomy on it. In the center is one of the new gray globes, an attempt to recreate the cool star chart from the movies. It's a nice effort, but I don't know why there'd be a globe in an Astronomy Class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final floor is the Divination Room. It doesn't sport the teacups from the Prisoner of Azkaban Hogwarts, but it does have a nice crystal ball all the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Other Tower</strong></p>
<p>Another boring dungeon serves as the bottom of this one. Snooze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next floor is being marketed, I believe, as the Room of Requirement when Harry and the D.A. are practicing in it. Save two sticker portraits of a witch and a wizard, it's completely bare and thus rather boring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next floor is Professor Lupin's office. It has a generic brown chair, a rather excellent blackboard, and a desk with a skull, potion bottle, and quill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final floor is a very nice Mirror of Erised, but there is no room for Harry to stand and stare into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifig Evaluation</h4>
<p><strong>Harry Potter</strong></p>
<p>Harry comes with a brown wand and brown broomstick. Necessary to the set for playability, but a snooze. We've already got him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lucius Malfoy</strong></p>
<p>Malfoy comes with a cape and his black walking stick. Nice, but again, we've already got him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Dementor</strong></p>
<p>I'm a broken record: this time, we've already got <em>two</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Professor Pomona Sprout</strong></p>
<p>Sprout is a fantastic figure; she comes with a brown wand. She fills in the gap that arrived when all the heads of houses save Sprout were included in Hogwarts Castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Professor Remus Lupin</strong></p>
<p>An improvement upon his original, Lupin is a fantastic fig with a nice suit. His face is the most detailed of all the faces, and though his hair isn't film-realistic, it's always suited him rather well. Lupin comes with a brown wand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neville Longbottom</strong></p>
<p>Again, an improvement on the original. The double-sided head can make Neville look friendly or friendly but clueless. A very nice pattern on the torso, he comes with a brown wand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gregory Goyle</strong></p>
<p>Goyle is a nice fig to add to the collection; he looks well standing next to Malfoy. Goyle comes with a black wand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So who - and what - is missing? Professor Sybill Trelawney, for sure, as the Divination Room feels rather useless without its owner. Vincent Crabbe as well, though he would be hard-pressed to appear as the actor left the film franchise because of drug charges. The only other ""I so want that!"" addition would be a greenhouse due to Professor Sprout's inclusion, but I can understand that this would be too expensive to produce and irrelevant to the set's focus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Building experience</h4>
<p>I awarded Hogwarts a 4 in this category. The bridge was fun enough to build, but of course the towers are what I got excited for. As the two are (primarily symmetrical) towers, the build can be rather repetitive, but the deviations from formula on the third floor of both towers and the little details inside keep the build interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set has great parts for the discerning MOCer. Lots of tan and sand green, of course, as with any Potter set. Some of the nice accessories include&nbsp;one of the new globes (in gray), tea cups, a crystal ball (with light blue gem inside), a blackboard, chair, skull, broomstick, and quill/feather piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>This set has fantastic playability. The bridge can be overturned by fire (though this doesn't work too well, but it's a nice thought) and, on a day when a child is feeling less violent, classrooms for a good old Hogwarts adventure. The variety of minifigures reinforces the theme of the possibilities to enact a magical ultra-battle, or just sneak around school.</p>
<p><br/>I would suggest, if buying for playability, to purchase the Forbidden Forest as well. The bridge (or ""viaduct"" in HP geek terms) leads to the Forbidden Forest, and this set, formerly titled ""Battle for Hogwarts"" is at a loss without Voldemort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Value for Money</h4>
<p>At 10.727p / 10.727c, the set isn't the cheapest ever, but it's well worth it. The exclusive minifigs simply seal the deal, and the fact that it's connectable to Hogwarts only adds to the value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overall Rating</h4>
<p>This set, with well-made minifigs, is a fantastic continuation of Hogwarts, as well as of the Harry Potter theme. Let's hope for more to come. I award this set a five.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"buzzandwoody2000","2011-07-08T21:46:57.63Z","Exellent Set!","<p>Once again, LEGO has gave us a great add-on to the Hogwarts Castle from 2010. Sitting here on my laptop, the two sets combined with Hagrid's Hut in front, I must say they look great. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I can't wait for the 15th of July. Well, I'll start with the minifigs. Great minifigures, this set. I don't mind Harry, since he's my favorite character. I use extra Harry's to make other students, so I don't mind.</p>
<h4>Harry James Potter </h4>
<p>Harry, born July 31st, 1980, Godric's Hollow, England. Harry has a Gryffindor Torso, with the standerd black pants. But, why is he in his school uniform? This is the <strong><em>Battle </em></strong>of Hogwarts, so you'd expect a causaul dressed Harry. But, he has his standerd double sided head with a smile and a angry face, and his common black hair.</p>
<h4>Neville Longbottom</h4>
<p>Birth dates unknown, but year was 1980, since he is in Harry's year. Hermione is the oldest out of all of them. Neville is a new minifig, once made in 2004 in Professor Lupin's classroom. His head is new, one side showing his buck teeth, and and the other smiling. He has brown hair, and a new torso with a hoodie that he wears during the Battle of Hogwarts in <strong><em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.</em></strong>&nbsp;Neville is wearing black pants.</p>
<h4>Remus John Lupin</h4>
<p>Birth dates unknown. Remus has his brown suit with a tie, and LEGO did a brilliant job with his face! He looks like he has faced Fenier Greyback and was bittin. His hair is wavy like Lupins' in the movies, so they did a nice job.</p>
<h4>Dementor</h4>
<p>A standerd one. The black hood, Dementor's kiss face and closed mouth, and a black cloak with a skeleton body under the cloak.</p>
<h4>Pomona Sprout</h4>
<p>Proffesor Sprout is a never seen before minifig. The hat is a common wizard's hat, only a tan one. Her face is a new face, and the dress is like McGonagall's, only brown, no cape, and other things on it. Good minifig.</p>
<h4>Gregory Goyle</h4>
<p>Also a new minifig. He was seen in Slytherin in 2002, but as Harry who used Polyjuice Potion to transform to Goyle. He has a buzz cut short brown hair, and another new face! Three this set! OH YEAH! He has a Slytherin torso and black pants. Good minifig, because you don't get Slytherin's that much. I'm&nbsp;a Gryffindor, but I'm just saying, even though I hate Slytherin. </p>
<h4>Lucius Malfoy</h4>
<p>Birth Dates unknown. He comes in three sets, but this one has a hood like Diagon Alley, unlike Freeing Dobby. He has his smirking face with his Death Eater mask on the other side. Lucius has a snake brooch on his shirt, a cape, and black pants.</p>
<p>Now to the castle. The bridge has a nice feature with the explosuin, but dosen't always work. The Detail is just like the 2010 one, which I am looking at both as I type this review. The left tower has the Divination classroom at the top, but the had thing is, no Proffesor Trelawny! I like the Astromonmy room, with the great globe, the scene of Albus Dumbledore's death. Below is the Gryffindor Boys Dormitry, with bunk beds in scarlet and gold, Gryffindor colors. Below is a dungen with a snake.</p>
<p>On the right, the top features the Mirror of Esired, which has a nice sticker and LEGO did a nice job. Below is Lupin's office. The chalkboard is a new sticker to me, and I like that they put a couple potions on the windowseal and a chair, so it looks like a Hogwarts office. Good Job. Below, The Room of Requirement, or the room of nothing? There is nothing inside. Lego disiponited us all, all they put was two stickers. The Dungeon is standerd.</p>
<p>Overall, I give in a 9. The only flaw was the Room of Requirement, and no Proffesor Trelawny. It is aa good set, but the price should be about $10 cheaper. This concludes my review of the Battle for Hogwarts.</p>

"duilim","2011-10-22T01:46:43.05Z","A great addition to Hogwarts Castle","<span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">As
 the title and a few others have said, this set is a great addition to 
Hogwarts Castle. Perhaps the best thing about it however, is that unlike
 the Ewok Attack set from Star Wars which needed Battle of Endor to 
complement it, this set actually stands up quite well in terms of 
playability on it's own. There's enough here to keep you occupied for 
hours on end, although admittedly, having the actual Hogwarts Castle 
does maximise it's play potential.<br><br></span><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Minifigures<br>A
 lot has been said about the repeat minifigures in this set - in 
particular, Harry, Lucius Malfoy and the Dementor, In all fairness 
however, I don't really see a problem here. Harry I think, is bound to 
be in all HP sets, whilst this is only the third set that Lucius has 
appeared in and the Dementor has only appeared in one other set. So 
Harry aside, these figures aren't exactly common. When you add to this 4
 other rare or never-seen-before figures - Prof. Sprout (first ever!), 
Lupin, Neville and Goyle - I think that you've got a very good selection
 of characters.<br>Prof. Sprout in particular is impressive - although I
 will admit that I'm reminded of Prof. McGonagall as the similarities 
between the two are clear.<br>Neville has a newly designed torso 
(without tie) whilst Goyle provides another Slytherin character to 
accompany Malfoy. Overall, I'm happy with the selection here, although 
perhaps Prof. Tralawney may have been a suitable addition here, given 
the presence of the Astronomy Tower and the Divination room. 9/10<br><br></span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Build<br>If
 you have Hogwarts castle, then it may be a sense of deja vu here 
although the open construction on the second floor of both towers 
provides something different. Both towers follow similar construction 
patterns which also means that you may feel that you're building the 
same thing twice (which in effect, you are). There's a nice mix of large
 and small pieces which make for a pleasant building experience. 8/10</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Design<br>Many
 people, myself included, have said that this is a good add on to last 
year's Hogwarts Castle (4842). It is - but be warned that it may look a 
little strange at first. The gray foundations on both towers of this set
 do make them seem a little out of place when incorporated with 4842 as 
it appears ""raised"" in contrast to the castle itself. This ""raised"" 
appearance is accentuated even more by the bridge, which comes to a 
complete stop at the towers. I know this is a minor detail, but it would
 have been nice if a couple of plates had been added so the bridge 
actually lead into the towers.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Both
 towers I'm glad to say are well detailed but their designs or more or 
less loosely based on 4842. The first, the astronomy tower depicts the 
""Room of Requirement"" on the first floor, with Gryffindor colors 
(again), and the balcony from the actual film on the second floor. Above
 this is the divination classroom, complete with crystal ball.</span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">The
 second tower is a little bare in comparison, with an empty first floor 
but our first ever classroom on the second. On the top is the Mirror of 
Erised - nothing really special here. 8/10<br><br></span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Pricing<br>I've
 been generally quite happy with the pricing of HP sets, and this set 
continues that trend. I'd say that the price is more or less spot on. 
8/10<br><br></span></div><div class=""BVRRReviewTextParagraph""><span class=""BVRRReviewText description"">Problems<br>Not
 many really - unless you're very picky. I'd say that more could have 
been done with the empty first floor on the second tower - perhaps a 
Hufflepuff common room??? - I'm sure yellow and black are easy colors to
 make - and to be quite honest, I'm sick of Gryffindor colors. It would 
have been just as easy for Lego to used silver and blue tiles, or even 
yellow and black for the bunk beds in the Room of Requirement. Some 
variety - please?</span></div><span class=""BVRRReviewText description""><br>In
 summary - a great set - with or without 4842 Hogwart's Castle. Highly 
recommended whether or not you're a HP fan. Good job Lego! 9/10</span>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4

This set was awesome as the minifigures go because we got 3 new ones. Remus Lupin, Neville Longbottom, and Prof. Sprout.

"Berrus_Brickus","2011-09-09T06:40:28.257Z","Battle for Hogwarts, Supposedly","<p>Before I start, I would just like to say: <strong>THERE IS NO REASON TO MARK THIS REVIEW AS UNHELPFUL JUST BECAUSE YOU DO NOT APPRECIATE HARRY POTTER, REVIEWS WRITTEN BY TFOLS, OR REVIEWS WHICH USE PICTURES</strong></p>
<p>I ordered this along with 4865 and 4866 from <a href=""mailto:Shop@Home""><FONT color=#4667a4>Shop@Home</FONT></a> on June 30th and it arrived on the 6th of July. I would of been disappointed with the arrival date, if I hadn't been out of town from the 31st until the 6th, as it only used to take three to four days rather than a whole week.</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/185px-4867_prod.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>This would probably be considered the fourth version of Hogwarts, I suppose depends on your thoughts though, but it is not only an expansion of 4842 Hogwarts Castle, but also an update, as it includes a more movie accurate astronomy tower and minifigures, like Professor Sprout, who were absent from the last rendition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would normally&nbsp;post pictures of the three other renditions here, if they resembled this&nbsp;set at all, so I'll skip that part for now.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/4867-0000-xx-23-1.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>The front of the box and instruction booklet (there is only one instruction booklet) is&nbsp;a picture of the Castle against a sunset (or sunrise). Harry, Neville, and The Death Eater/Lucius seem involved in a battle, while Professors Sprout and Lupin smile above watching a dementor fly across the sky,&nbsp;strange. I personally think that the background is beautiful, the sky is red/orange/yellow against the dark ruins of another part of the castle, which doesn't make too much sense, but oh well. &nbsp;In the corner of the box, there is parchment square in the lower right-hand corner which shows the&nbsp;seven minifigures, and also gives the French names for a few of the characters.&nbsp; On the top of the box, there are 1:1 images of minifigures, this part of&nbsp;box is slightly different than on 4842, the&nbsp;taller&nbsp;minifigures (Sprout and the Dementor) are cut off at the top, rather than downsized.&nbsp; On the back is the normal parchment background, with a back view of the castle, play features, and accessories. On the back of the instruction manual, we have the normal <em>WIN!</em> advertisement with some random kid screaming at you. Not very attractive at all.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>According to the box, there are&nbsp;466 pieces, which is pretty good for $50, considering that this is a liscensed set, and there are some fairly large pieces (the sand green tower roofs, the octagonal bases, and the corner panels). The majority of the castle is tan, gray,&nbsp;sand green. Brown, Lime Green, and&nbsp;Dark Green&nbsp;may also&nbsp;be found&nbsp;around the exterior.&nbsp;Other colors&nbsp;depend on what&nbsp;room.&nbsp;The gray globe from the astronomy tower is exclusive, and is printed with galaxies and star systems, rather than the planet Earth as Toy Fair showed. Other rare parts are a sand green hinge, a blank&nbsp;blue minifigure head,&nbsp;a dark tan trapdoor, and a white feather&nbsp;piece. That's all I can think of for rare pieces which are not used on the minifigures, other items may be seen later in the review.&nbsp;There are stickers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts List at Bricklink- http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=4867-1</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set includes&nbsp;seven minifigures, 1 is completley new,&nbsp; 3 are remakes, 3 are recycled: The standard Harry Potter, a redesigned Professor Lupin, a redesigned Neville Longbottom, a redesigned Gregory Goyle, a reused Dementor (previously exclusive to 4842), and another Lucius/Death Eater.&nbsp;Everybody who uses a wand,&nbsp;has one; Brown for heroes, and black for Villians.&nbsp;A green snake is also included, who I would think is Nagini.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harry Potter:</strong></p>
<p>Original</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/103px-harryyellow.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>2004 Redesign</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/103px-hp086.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>Current Variation</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/103px-potter4736.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>The latest variation has back printing (continuing stripe on the back of his sweater) and a double sided head happy/angry.&nbsp;If you already have Harry, the&nbsp;extra robes may be used for Neville.</p>
<p><strong>Neville Longbottom:</strong></p>
<p>Original (2004)</p>

<p>Current Variation</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/116px-nevillenew.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>The newer one has a double sided head, happy/angry head. In person though, it looks like extremely happy/stupidly happy. There is packprinting, a continuation of the cross design and a hood.</p>
<p><strong>Professor Sprout</strong>:</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/116px-profsprout.jpg[/img]&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is backprinting and no double sided head.</p>

<p>Current Variation</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/116px-lupinnew.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>It's hard to tell between the two pictures, but Lupin's hair is the same color in both variations, the 2004 picture captures the color better. I don't think that these figures should be compared, as one face is bearded and the other isn't. Lupin has printing on the back of his suit and no double head.</p>
<p><strong>Lucius Malfoy/Death Eater:</strong></p>
<p>Original (2002)</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/103px-lucius2.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/103px-lucius3.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>This face is double sided here, the normal side is identical to the original, but against flesh</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current Variation</p>

<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/116px-goylenew.jpg[/img]</p>
<p>There is backprinting (a green/silver stripe and tuck marks) and no double face.</p>

<p>Current Variation</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/126px-dementornew.png[/img]</p>
<p>There is a double sided face (closed/open mouth). A clear 3x3 radar dish is included as a stand.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>I liked the build, as on most floors large and small pieces were&nbsp;both used fairly. I haven't seen the use of the tower bases before, and I like the top floors (not the attics, the floors) of the towers. There were also interesting techniques used on the Mirror and&nbsp; Astronomy Globe.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p><strong>Viaduct Bridge:</strong></p>
<p>This is the bridge in between the two towers. It is not nearly as large or as deep as the bridge is in the movies, but neither is anything else. I don't mind it TOO much. The few things that do bug me though are due to the play feature, when you turn the knob on the back, the bridge ""explodes"". Though it is entertaing, the plates are loose because of it, and due to the knob at the end, the bridge just stops suddenly. Also, once the plates are blown of, there are white bricks visible, which do not match the rest of the exterior's color scheme. Also, the play feature doesn't work too well half-heartedly</p>
<p><strong>Astronomy Tower:</strong></p>
<p>There are two floors, a dungeon, and an attic. The dungeon isn't much, there is nothing down there (except a snake and a skull) and a minifigure is unable to stand without modifications. </p>
<p>The next floor up is the Room of Requirment with removable Gryffindor Bunkbeds.</p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/185px-hufflpuff.png[/img]</p>
<p>Another floor up is the astronomy balcony with star chart globe.</p>
<p>Another floor up is the attic with a (tiny) Divination Room (but no Trelawny?). </p>
<p>[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/185px-divination.png[/img]</p>
<p>And here is the entire back of the tower (from Toyfair though, so there are some minor differences)[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Berrybrick/Review/4842/123px-interiorfirsttower.jpg[/img]</p>
<p><strong>Second Tower:</strong></p>
<p>There are another two floors, another dungeon, and another attic. </p>
<p>The dungeon is identical to the Astronomy Tower.</p>
<p>The next floor up is another rendition of the Room of Requirment, but here it's empty, save for two portraits.</p>

If you were dissapointed with how unaccurate the Astronomy Tower was in 4842, this one is both more accurate, and, judging by the measurements LEGO gave us on how tall these sets are, exactly the same height as the second tower (here) and a few inches shorter than the Gryffindor Tower in 4842. It's still not exactly the tallest, but still much closer than last one (which was shorter than the Great Hall).</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Well, I liked this set, but I know that not everyone does. Mostly because they were expecting a set the size as the Death Star with every character LEGO never made. That was defintly not going to happen. I don't know what the set looks like connected to 4842 first-hand as I do not yet own in, but both of the Eurobricks reviewers have pictures of it and say that at first it will look strange because of the two rocky bases, but after you get used to it-wonderful. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is considerably larger than the similarly priced&nbsp;Hagrid's Hut ($40), but I couldn't easily tell you whether or not to choose between this and that. But I would have to say it depends on if you are interested in Hogwarts, but unable to pay $130 for 4842. But if you have 4842, I would probably recomend Hagrid's Hut. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recomend this product to a Harry Potter fan or somebody interested in the&nbsp;all the&nbsp;tan and sand green pieces.</p>

<h4>The Box</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been liking the design of the recent LEGO Harry Potter boxes. The one thing that slightly irks me is the size. In the case of big sets like this, I always find it disappointing whenever there are only about two or three plastic bags inside. Hence, the box could've been&nbsp;made smaller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[IMG]http://i1157.photobucket.com/albums/p592/PrincePotter/IMG_0652.jpg[/IMG]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LEGO continues with the numbered bags packaging; which actually saves time when looking for pieces to be used for only a section of the whole model. They should keep this up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Minifigs</h4>
<p>You get a total of seven minifigures from this set. However, despite the good number, I find the inclusion of two lame villains a huge letdown. Did they really need to put another Lucius Malfoy? And what's up with Gregory Goyle? They could've put in better and more prominent characters. I would've appreciated it if they included suits of armour instead.&nbsp;The only stand-out minifigs are Professor Sprout, Lupin, and&nbsp;Neville. Of course this&nbsp;set&nbsp;won't be complete without Harry Potter; but I can't say much about his minifig as I've already got more than a dozen of him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Bridge</h4>
<p>The exploding viaduct is a real cool feature. It's simple, yet brilliant. Nothing more to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Towers</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two towers each consist of four floors. There's nothing really special about their features but you'll get some good rare accessories like the crystal ball, the&nbsp;globe and the Mirror of Erised. I presonally like the structure of the towers. As an expansion set, it gives Hogwarts a more definitive and fortified look. It also adds a sense of epicness when you recreate key scenes from the movies.</p>

<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>This set is already great on its own. But having this added to your existing Hogwarts Castle collection (if you're a LEGO HP fan) will make it even more cooler. And of all the tower designs LEGO has ever created for the HP theme, I think this set has the best one. I have to admit that when I first read about this being shown at the NY Toy Fair, I wasn't really that impressed. The descriptions I read didn't thrill me at first; but upon seeing the interiors&nbsp;as well as the overall look, I started rooting for this set.&nbsp;The unique&nbsp;castle parts that you will get are just hard to ignore. It also serves as an alternative if you find set number 4842 (2010 Hogwarts Castle) way too expensive (trust me, I know I do). My desire to have the said set has slightly worn off since this new&nbsp;one contains some&nbsp;of the parts I've been wanting to have. It's a good thing LEGO came up with the&nbsp;idea of an expansion set for Hogwarts. At least this&nbsp;would make my Hogwarts collection a lot more epic. The only thing I didn't like was the sticker sheet system. I do hope they get rid of that soon. Luckily for me, I managed to put everything on without a hitch. =p</p>

"woodall_aidan","2011-11-12T23:27:22.97Z","Fiendfyre?","This set is such a great set. I got it in Legoland California for 50 dollars. It includes Harry Potter, even though he's not supposed to wear his school attire, Neville Longbottom, with his Fair Isle hoodie, Remus Lupin, Pomona Sprout, Gregory Goyle, Lucius Malfoy as a Death Eater, and Dementor. The first tower consists of the Divination tower, the Astronomy tower, and Gryffindor bunkbeds. The second one consists of the Mirror of Erised, Defense Against the Dark Arts office, and a hallway. Between the two towers is the viaduct. That is from the part when Neville gets chased by a bunch of Death Eaters and Snatchers. The viaduct blows up and Scabior, the leader of the Snatchers, dies. The set could've had the scene with the Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement, which would've give Goyle a purpose in the set. I'm giving this set a 5/5 for many reasons, many because the viaduct and the minifigures.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4

Most of The classrooms and mini figures features in this set have never been features before or have been revamped like Neville Longbottom and Gregory Goyle. The set comes with the bridge Seamus, Cho and Neville destroyed in Deathly Hallows Part 2 and can even break when twisting a handle to recreate that scene. As I said this does link to the other Hogwarts from Half-Blood Prince which makes the Hogwarts look stunning. If you have two Lucius Malfoys, simply make one of them a Death Eater to create an enemy in your adventures. 9/10</p>
