"Duq","2011-09-04T17:33:35.747Z","Not that cool ","<p>At first this set seems to be third in a series that started with 4896 in 2006 and 4993 in 2008; it's another big Creator car that costs around €45. At closer inspection this car is a lot smaller than the previous two.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p></p><h4 style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; ""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px; "">There are three instruction booklets, one for each of the three models. The main model, the convertible, uses nearly all the parts in the box. Building isn't difficult. Some Technic parts are used for the steering and rear wheels and some elements like mirrors, windscreen and seats are attached with clips to place them at an angle. Front and back bumpers are attaced to bricks with studs on their side.</span></h4><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px; "">The second model is a single-seater race car. It's a little easier to build with fewer pieces attached sideways. You notice that it's a B-model from the parts and colours used in some places.</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px; "">I haven't built the third model, a telehandler. With no steering and an arm that can only be raised, not extended it doesn't look very interesting.</span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px; ""><h4 style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial; "">Parts</h4><div>The set contains a nice selection of parts. A lot of tiles in black, blue, white and yellow (including blue and yellow 1x3) as well as cheese slopes in all those colours (including some 1x2 in yellow and black). There are yellow plate hinges for the doors and grey/white click hinges for the seats. The rarest parts in the set are probably the two transparent headlight bricks.</div></span></div><p></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The convertible is a nice looking car. It has steering using the black gear on the back. The wheel arches in the front combined with the slightly angled doors are a nice touch. The bonnet and doors open. It's not all good news though.</p><p>The steering wheel does not move and the steering angle is very limited. The knob on the back is quite ugly and the axle running through the middle of the car in plain view isn't pretty either. Under the bonnet is... something. It's the least convincing engine I've seen in a while.</p><p>You can't help but compare this car to the two I mentioned at the start and it just isn't in the same league.</p><p>The race car has a good shape given the available parts. Using the white and blue parts (that form the seats on the first model) on the outside&nbsp;this time&nbsp;along with the black and yellow gives the car a bit of a Renault livery. Steering lock is much better on this car and here the steering wheel does move the wheels. There are no other moving or removable parts though.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This then is an ok set, but not a great set. There are too many little things just not right. The steering on the main model is disappointing as is the lack of moving parts on the race car. As a parts pack it's not bad though; 621 parts for €43 is good value.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,4
"legomaniac","2011-10-13T13:19:46.867Z","A mediocre set, but much better than thought of.","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got this set for $30, otherwise I wouldn't of bought it. At first it seems to be a mediocre set, which it is, but it was a fun build. Feels really sturdy and can be rolled around without any parts or car breaking in half.<br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Building was straight forward, no surprises or challenges. I was disappointed that there was no trunk and the steering knob takes it's place. Will go well along side the 5893 offroad truck. The yellow color and blue/white interior doesn't match in my option. Would of loved to see the car in green or blue.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This set will be perfect for someone looking for a easy build or just getting started with bigger creator sets. The $40 price is pretty good, but try to look for deals.<br></p><p><br></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Likes:</p>Same scale as the 5893 Off Road Power truck set.<br><br>Two clear bricks on the front of the car (don't know the name) are new to me, so 2 special parts and the steering wheel is black.<br><br>Lots of yellow pieces, which will be great for MOCs.<br><br>modern styling.<br><br>Black pin stripe on the sides<br><br><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Dislikes:</span></p><p>No trunk.</p><p><br></p><p>Dashboard looks lousy, steering wheel would be under the drivers neck lol. Can be easily fixed.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Looks like an economy / college kids car.</p><p><br></p><p>Top of engine is too simple, but can be easily fixed.<br></p><p><br></p><p>_____<br></p><p>In conclusion my thoughts of just building this car for fun and put the pieces in my parts buckets was canceled for now. The set seems better than I thought, although I can't get over the lack of thought on the dashboard. Must of been a 5 second build. <br></p><p>But it's LEGO and you can change it and make it the way you want :)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,4
"DrOrrery","2011-11-17T07:25:37.757Z","Take you riding in my car, car","<p>I hadn't planned to get this set but, seeing it on sale and liking the look of it I decided to grab it. &nbsp;Overall I'm glad I did.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Being a creator set, you'd expect a good mix of parts and this one doesn't disappoint there. &nbsp;It's especially loaded with yellow curves, so if you feel like making that yellow space cruiser or maybe a Lego canary, this one's for you. &nbsp;Lots of sideways connecting bricks and lots of little flat tiles make this a handy set if you want to do some studs not on top or smoothed out work. &nbsp;It also has rack and pinion steering, always helpful.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The main build is pretty straight forward, there aren't really any tricky bits. &nbsp;The two alternative models are even simpler, and probably aren't going to provide a huge amount of interest in this case.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The main model looks like some kind of Audi convertible, and I must say I thought it looked pretty good. &nbsp;The curves look right and I especially liked the fact that the doors flared out rather than being parallel. &nbsp;The car is about the size and functionality of a large die cast metal model, with opening doors, hood, moving seats and steerable front wheels controlled by a small black gear wheel on the back. &nbsp;Overall this model is very sturdy. &nbsp;The bumpers and windscreen may occasionally come off with rough handling, but the main core of the car is extremely sturdy. &nbsp;The alternative models are fine but again they're not hugely interesting, although the one thing I would point out with the F1 car is that the steering wheel actually turns the wheels. &nbsp;For smaller models that's pretty rare. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I liked the build and the finished product. &nbsp;The parts are useful and this is one of the best value price per part sets of the year. &nbsp;Well worth a look.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,5
"julik366","2013-10-19T23:32:52.567Z","5767 Review...","<p>Hello and welcome to my review of the 5767 Cool Cruiser. It costs $39.99, although I got it for $43.99</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>On the front of the box, you get a picture of the Cool Cruiser in it's main model. This set has 3 instruction manuals; 1 for the convertible, 1 for the construction vehicle, and one for the race car.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>It has 621 pieces, 2 which are rare are the transparent white 1X1. Never seen those</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>This set has 0 minifigures... But its a large scale car so what do you expect?</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I decided to build the Main Model which is the convertible. The build took me 1-2 hr and I spent like 1 hour modifying the convertible.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It looks really cool, and I like that its strong (parts don't fall off that easily)/It has opening doors, and the interior could be better, although I modified it. Under the hood, you get a (not so detailed) engine, and I decided to take that engine out and decided to modify the hood as well as put in a different engine. This set is not meant to be a toy, as I like to put it on display.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is actually a great set to put on display, and 621 pieces for $43.99? That is a lot of pieces for the money.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,2,5
