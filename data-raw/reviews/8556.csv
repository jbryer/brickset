"Higgins","2011-05-05T23:37:53.953Z","Beware the Rocks!","<p>LEGO Creator set <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">#5770 Lighthouse Island</span> has 518 pieces. That comes to about 7.7 cents per brick at $40 USD. I spied this while checking out at the LEGO store recently and had to grab it! It's a 3in1 set and the alternate builds are called <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">boathouse</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">seafood restaurant</span>.&nbsp; Included are two small reflective stickers and a light brick. I'm really glad it came with the light brick instead of a sound brick!<br></p><p><br></p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4><p><span>[img]http://thebrick.mindcop.net/review_images/5770/PICT2803.jpg[/img]</span></p><p>One minifigure comes with the set which is nice :) To me it looks like an orange hoody/sweatshirt with the hood printed on back.

<h4>Summary</h4><p>I really like this set - I had been waiting for it's release and kind of forgot about it until I saw it high up on the shelf while checking out.</p><p>It was easy to build, didn't explode while being built, but still looks really cool and felt like I built something significant. The working light on top is fun to goof with. The seagulls and fish and minifig and life preserver ring and light brick are all nice. Not a ton of detail inside but the small stove and mug are a good start for adding your own touch.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Yet another great Creator set! And unlike too many other sets lately, I can't complain about the price at all. It's decent all around. I might have to get 1 for each build :)<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
"dougts","2011-05-10T01:53:29.83Z","Love It","<p>I'm a huge lighthouse buff, so I obviously had my eye on this set for awhile. The price point is pretty reasonable at $40 US, clocking in $10 higher than the recent log cabin, but there's a bit more here as well, so it feels about right. &nbsp;The build was pretty straightforward and typical of a creator set. &nbsp;Not much other than straight stud on top building, with the only real interesting bit being the crank gear that turns the reflector inside the top of the lighthouse. &nbsp;the little boat is well designed - especially the motor, which tilts and has a spinning prop. &nbsp;Great work on such a small item. &nbsp;Finished product looks great as a display piece, right down to the seagulls.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Minifigure (seems we are to get 1 in all the creator &quot;house&quot; style sets going forward, as I see the upcoming hillside house is to have 1 as well)</li>
    <li>Working Light with rotating reflector</li>
    <li>Unique lattice round top door and lattice windows</li>
    <li>neat little power boat</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    <li>would have liked a true baseplate - maybe a 16x32 blue</li>
    <li>interior of tower is not hollow</li>
    <li>some minor mismatched colors (the two different grays in the walls, the yellow technic pieces). The former is likely due to the alternate builds, while the latter is probably piece availability</li>
    <li>Feels like a piece is missing from the top, both to cover the protruding grey axle, and &quot;finish&quot; the lighthouse. a black &nbsp;round &quot;Final brick&quot; would probably look nice.</li>
</ul>
<div>All in all, I'm very pleased with the build, and like most Creator sets the value is good (at least for LEGO). &nbsp;I'd love to see a much larger scale lighthouse in the future with a full interior spiral staircase, keeper's quarters, etc. &nbsp;Until then, this will do nicely as a display piece in my office, which coincidentally has a lighthouse themed decor. </div>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,4
"oscholes","2011-09-25T13:28:37.567Z","Awesome set for a rainy night","<p>I bought this on a bit of a whim recently, when I was looking for something to do on a rainy night. I absolutely love the creator series, and this is one of my favorites so far. The design is really good, and the build is moderately challenging - there are some slightly complicated elements, but overall it is quite straightforward. It's not the most ""playable"" set ever, but it does have some neat features, including the rotating light, and a few internal details like a ladder leading up to the light and a stove for the lighthouse keeper. I don't know if the minifigure is unique, but he's certainly unusual, and a nice addition to my collection. As with all the 3-in-1 sets, there are instructions for two other models, both of which provide a nice challenge, and a reasonable level of playability. Younger builders may struggle with all three designs, but older builders will absolutely find it a pleasant way to spend an evening. Bonus points for the light brick, which is a nice, relatively uncommon piece.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
"DrOrrery","2011-07-04T08:33:10.73Z","Gem of a set","<p>When you take away the movie licenses, board games, collectible mini-figs and the like, Lego is really just about one thing: &nbsp;Recreating a world in miniature, brick by brick. &nbsp;That's what I love about Lego, and this set really epitomises that idea. &nbsp;It is a perfect little creation that is fun to make and looks wonderful.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build here is fairly straight forward, it's a smallish model that all goes together reasonably easily. &nbsp;It can be put together at a fairly leisurely place in about half an hour. &nbsp;The other two builds are even more simple. &nbsp;There's very little here that even a very young builder would have trouble with. &nbsp;The two gear wheels that turn the lighthouse mirror by use of a crank are quite a nice little touch, a good introduction to how gears work for young children.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This is a particularly good looking model. &nbsp;The red and white lighthouse look itself is very iconic, but the details are what makes it. &nbsp;The hand railings made out of rails, skeleton feet and taps at the ends come together perfectly, the little dock with its life preserver looks great, the barbeque grill, the seagulls, the way the side of the lighthouse opens up to show a small ladder and an oven inside. &nbsp;The amount of detail they've put into this model is what really makes it fun. &nbsp;And the previously mentioned handle and crank together with the light brick to make the lighthouse light up are very cool. &nbsp;The smallest of the alternative models, the restaurant, has some very nice details as well.</p><p></p><h4 style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 1.1em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; "">Playability</h4><div>Once you've built a lighthouse, there's a limited number of things you can do with it. &nbsp;You're generally not, for instance, going to use it in a grand space battle (unless you've recently been watching that episode of The Goodies). &nbsp;There are definitely things to do here, but the playability of this set, and the creator sets in general, seems to me to be more about building things with Lego rather than playing with the completed set. &nbsp;With this model there are a lot of small, repeated pieces, a lot of different colours, and three sets of instructions for a start. &nbsp;This is a set that is going to be taken apart and put back together a lot, and I think it's got a lot of possibility there.</div><p></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a great set, and I think on of my favourites for the year. &nbsp;It's small enough to be easy to build but big enough to be interesting. &nbsp;If you like building as much as swooshing, put this one on the top of your list.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Mr__Minifigure","2011-09-11T20:21:40.29Z","Excellent Creator set...","<p>I was very excited to get this set, and I was not disappointed! It's a lot of fun to build and play with after.</p><p><br></p><h4>The Build:</h4><div>I chose the lighthouse to build. I found it rewardingly challenging for a 500-piece set. It is a nice experience in the sense that it stays firmly together for the build instead of falling apart, but it has enough pieces &amp; nuances to make you appreciate the build more. The fact that it has three things to build out of the same pieces, each arguably the same coolness.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>The Set:</h4><div>Once built, it is very cool in appearance, and would make a <b>great</b>&nbsp;set for a brickfilm or LEGO layout. However, it is difficult to ""play with"" in the traditional sense, because, as the previous reviewer said, it's a lighthouse. For a lighthouse, it's as playable as it can get (and I mean that nicely). Compared to a helicopter, though, it is lacking. But it's a building, so whaddya expect? Compared against other buildings, it is quite fun, especially with the rotating light.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>The Summary:</h4><div>I like it more than most buildings that I have. It's fun to build, useful as a prop in films or as a building on a layout, and fun to play with. It's also a steal for $40 with the number of unusual pieces and cool design.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"DirtSquirt","2011-11-08T17:43:53.817Z","Really Fun Set","I absolutely love the Creator series. &nbsp;This is a great set. &nbsp;All of the builds are really fun and the kids love to play with them. &nbsp;There were some disappointments though. You have to put reflective stickers on 2 bricks for the lighthouse build but the stickers are not needed for the other two builds. &nbsp;The bricks with the stickers on them need to be used and there is no where to hide them so they are out in the open and look out of place. &nbsp;It would have been nice if an extra of each of those bricks was supplied. &nbsp;Also, the boathouse and the seafood restaurant both have open doorways. &nbsp;It would have been nice if they had supplied a door that would fit in that door frame as well. &nbsp;Had those three items been included with the set, I would have rated it a 5.",FALSE,4,4,5,5,5

Simple things such as the ladder inside a constructed from plates and single-stud elements. The seagulls, which you would expect to arrive in a single mould, are brilliantly made again from little more than a handful of bricks and clever ideas.

I have to confess that this won't blaze your room in a sheen of dazzling light, but the important thing is that it 'works', and can be functioned further with the rotating mirror section (worked through a crank on the size). Arguably the best concealed feature is that the side of the Lighthouse actually opens up to reveal what's inside. The man has a nice little stove (with chimney), a mug, the staircase and a beautiful window lattice.

"Ernst","2012-04-02T13:46:29.243Z","Lighthouse Island, another superb Creator set","<p>Overall 5 bricks : since I bought small Creator sets for my son this theme got my attention and this is another example of a great set. The subject is entirely different from earlier sets but a great main design with excellent parts. The 2 other buildings look great too, but the Lighthouse only deserves 5 bricks already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 5 bricks : I will edit the review later when I have built&nbsp;the other&nbsp;books. </p>
<ul>
<li>1. The Light House : First the speedboat, a great little boat with a good looking outboard engine in nice colors. After that starting with the blue baseplates en the grey slopes and green plates as base for the Lighthouse with the small lodge. Nice looking small house with a lovely black roof. The tower is characterized by and built with macaroni bricks, on top a great fence built with white tabs, skeleton legs and sticks.&nbsp;Inside you find a small stairs and a mechanism to turn the 2 stickered&nbsp;slopes used as mirror. The lightower is a great design and works marvelous, when you push the roof and turns it gives real lightbeams !! A great detail is the fact you can open the rear side, thanks to the use of hinges. Finishing touch are of course the minifigure, the fishes and the cute seagulls. Overall a beautifull building and a great first result.</li></ul>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : really to much to mention but I will name a few. Number one of course the lightbrick, the glass bricks, the macaroni parts, the blue and green plates, the big circle roofplate&nbsp;and of course the minifigure and fishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks : of course the posibility of the different sets to built and the fun you can have with this Creatorset with the light. The presence of the minifigure (rare in Creator sets) increases the playability of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : Great set with 3 designs, great parts usefull for all kinds of MOC's, great playability for an advise retailprice of €40,00 is already good and I paid even less. So worth every cent you pay for it, 5 bricks !!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
