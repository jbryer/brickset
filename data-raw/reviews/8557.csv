However, this house fails to disappoint, it includes everything you can ask for (except furniture) and then a little bit more.<div><br></div><div>For the main model:</div><div><br></div><div>The build is really easy and it will take about 2 1/2 hours to complete, so sit back, relax, and enjoy the colourful pieces as you are building.</div><div><br></div><div>For the first time ever (actually second, after 5766 Log Cabin), a minifigure is included. His appearance is very generic with a smile, plain red shirt, and blue pants.</div><div><br></div><div>The first build is the car, which is quite rare in a Creator house set. (last car included in a Creator house set was 4954 Model Town House). Although the proportions are a bit off, the car is still a nice addition if you are lacking vehicles in your city. Basic details include headlights, brake lights, yellow licence plates, wind shield, and a steering wheel (no doors).</div><div><br></div><div>The second build is the landscape, and I have to say, this is the most impressive landscape I've seen Lego create. The base is made up of new 16x16 plates. The backyard is packed with details such as assorted shrubs and flowers, tree, extremely detailed and epic BBQ grill (which can be lifted open to reveal the charcoal), sausages on grill, lawn chair, table with cup, sloped terrain, stairs, cobblestones, and even a dog made of bricks. The minifigure can trim the shrubs using a special hedge clipper piece.</div><div><br></div><div>The house itself was also very outstanding. A garage area is included to accommodate the vehicle, and beside the garage is a tap for the garden hose. Stairs built into the sloped terrain lead up to the house. A doorbell sound brick is even included, but it is not necessary to make this set perfect. When you go into the house, there is nothing but a fireplace, but there is a lot of room to add furniture. French doors lead outside to the backyard. A staircase leads to the second floor, which is also very big and empty. A door leads outside to the patio.</div><div><br></div><div>The first floor is accessed by lifting the second floor off, and the second floor can be accessed via the hinged roof at the back, or the solar panel.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall a great set all around and I recommend it to anyone.

The design was a pleasant surprise.<br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall rating:</span><br>The Hillside House offers a new twist to the Creator house line with the unique multi-level landscape. This allows for a first floor with something other than AstroTurf for a floor covering. I could be completely satisfied with the house all by itself, but almost as a bonus, the set includes a small car, the first since the 2007 <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=4954-1"">4954 Model Town House</a> (I believe) and a mini figure.</p><p>Is this the first Creator house to include a mini figure?<br></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This set greatly improves upon the interior space over many previous Creator houses.</span><br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Building experience:</span><br>Nice alternative to the standard flat base plate build. This was the most interesting aspect of the build. Being a Creator house, the packages aren't really organized sequentially. It's best to organize the pieces before beginning to build.<br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Parts:</span><br>Other than the door bell sound brick and some dark green sloped pieces, most of the pieces are rather basic. In my opinion, this isn't a set you buy for exotic pieces, you buy it for a very functional house.</p><p>The sound brick does have some screws on the bottom, so it <span style=""font-style: italic;"">might</span> be possible to change the battery when it gives out.<br></p><p>There is a healthy portion of large plates and while I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, the pattern on the bottom seems slightly different.</p><p>There are a few long 1x16 bricks and some 2x10 bricks.</p><p>One male mini figure. Nothing unique, but at least one is included.<br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Playability:</span><br>From a playability perspective, this is an extremely successful design. The first floor is spacious and open, with plenty of room to add furniture. The second floor, like many sets, is limited in headroom, but distinguishes itself in being remarkably clean and spacious. Not a lot of structural arches cluttering things up or limiting your options. The second floor is accessible through a hinged roof on one side, similar to the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=4996-1"">4996 Beach House</a> and a hinged solar panel on the opposite side.</p><p>The car has kind of a 4 wheel drive look, that hints slightly at an off road quality.</p><p>There's an outdoor barbecue grill with hinged top, sausages, table for one&nbsp; and a brick constructed dog.<br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Value for the money:</span><br>The price per piece seems pretty reasonable. The true value of this set lies in the good design.<br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Areas for improvement:</span><br>Honestly, no real complaints. Overall, I think this design is close to perfect, while leaving plenty of room for motivated builders to easily expand on the base model. Extending an L wing out from where the first floor glass doors are could add a lot of interior room to both floors. Or extending the second floor to overhang the car port could be interesting.<br></p><p>I'd probably like to upgrade the size of the stepping stones. They seem a tad small.<br></p><p>Yet, another house with a corner water faucet! Still seems like a tripping hazard. This time on LEGO concrete. Ouch! Great for washing the car, but it's a long way from that barbecue grill should there be a fire.<br></p><p>I was under the impression that instructions were being packaged in a more protective manner, but these were still packaged loose.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Final thoughts:</span><br>One of the best Creator houses for interior space, playability and a mini figure and car for a bonus.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

You get a good amount of those in grey and green, including several of quite long length.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyone who is a fan of the Creator houses would be remiss to not add this to your collection.

"Lint","2012-06-11T08:19:46.707Z","Why haven't you bought this already?","I picked this up today on sale for $60 AUD and was astounded by the quality of this set. I am not normally a purchaser of the Creator theme but this particular set is turning me into a fan. The Hillside house is an appreciatably large set which features a 2 storey home on a square and slightly multi-level block (hence the hillside) with a very large garden, garage and car. At no point is this set not a joy to build. The largely brick-built house is brilliant and features a lot of interesting construction to break up the monotony such as double patio doors, faucets, lanterns, a fireplace, balcony, solar panel and doorbell. The sound-brick for the doorbell is the gimmick of this set, producing a typical doorbell sound with dog barking after. I would have rather LEGO left this feature out to reduce the cost of the set but it would understandably entertain children to no end (well until the poor battery dies or a crazed parent decides to hide the brick). The garden does not suffer from a lack of interesting builds either with shrub, tree, a satisfyingly simple garden chair, stone hopped garden path, the most AMAZING BRICK BUILT BARBECUE TO DATE and I even like the brick built scotty dog. There is plenty of play value as well with windows and doors that open, a very good looking car and naturally a roof panel that opens up and a easily detachable second floor to allow access to the insides of the house. I have not even tried the 2 other house designs for this set. Anyway enough about my infatuation with this set and onto the pros and cons list:<br><br><h4><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pros</span></h4><ul><li>An absolute joy to build. Easily the best build I've had this year and I have had some pretty ood ones. This is up there with the modulars except for much less cost.</li><li>The house looks complete from all angles. The garden looks exquisite. That car is hot. This is a set you can proudly display.<br></li><li>Heaps of play value. Obviously the sound brick doorbell. The barbecue is absolutely fantastic. The garden chair swivels. Most doors and windows open. Even the garage/car porch flips up. You also get a minifig.</li><li>Sizeable area. The house does not feel cramped at all and the garden is by no means limited.</li><li>Lots of brick parts for builders. Lots of accessory parts for accessorisers. There is good parts value here.</li><li>Imagination: feathers become garden shears, a few plates and an arch become a dog, a tee'd spigot becomes a water faucet (okay so that last one is not so far fetched), I love this kind of stuff.<br></li></ul><p><br></p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Price. The normal RRP here ~$100 is quite steep. No doubt bumped up by the feature sound brick.</li><li>The inside of the house is barely furnished and can look quite dull. However I believe this is common for the other large Creator houses.</li><li>Minor complaint but this set includes one of the plainest modern minifigures in existence.</li></ul><br>In closing I would recommend this set to anyone, even if they are not normally a Creator set enthusiast. It is a genuinely brilliant set and my only legitimate complaint is the high RRP. That said, I would say this set is worth full RRP purely for the building experience. For parents, I would like to think that this set would appeal to both boys and girls as the play value for a house like this is unlimited. The house could be furnished with accessories from the recent Friends line or could be the scene for an exciting home-burgulary by the robbers from the CITY police line. For adult fans of Lego, I don't think there is a legitimate excuse for not owning this set if you have the cash for it.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"Gippy","2012-08-16T01:15:56.577Z","Best large Creator house despite the premium","When this set was first released, there was some mixed reception:<br>""It costs more than the Family Home (6754) it's replacing!""<br>""It has less pieces than the Family Home and is smaller!""<br>""$25 more than the Apple Tree House (5891) for only 175 more pieces?!""<br>""The sound brick is an annoying gimmick!""<br><br>This review will mainly focus on comparing the three sets' primary builds from a playability perspective.<br><h4>First floor comparison<br></h4>Family Home dimensions: 20 studs x 14 studs x 9 bricks<br>Apple Tree House dimensions: 8 studs x 18 studs x 7 bricks + 5 x 7 stud garage space<br>Hillside House dimensions: 16 studs x 14 studs x 7 bricks<br><br>The Family Home has the largest first floor of the three. However, the Hillside House actually has the same width, and is not much smaller lengthwise. The 7 brick height is more practical for playing inside, especially for those with large hands, and is better proportionally suited to minifigure scale. All the current modular buildings also use a 7 brick height for each floor.<br><br>The first floor design of the Apple Tree House is terrible because the garage isn't partitioned from the rest of the floor. If a car was parked in there, a poor minifigure would suffocate from carbon monoxide poisoning. Adding a wall that runs parallel from the right side of the garage to the rear wall will reduce living space to a mere 8 x 9 area.<br><br>The Family Home might boast the largest living space, but the Hillside House is more practical and wins out.<br><h4>Second floor comparison</h4><p>The Family Home and Hillside House have about the same amount of available area on the second floors as on the first floors. However, their approaches to accessing this space are different. The Family Home splits the second floor into two halves, allowing for easy access by removing either half. The Hillside House's second floor is a single detachable part much in the same vein as the modular buildings.</p><p>Once you start playing with them, the advantage of the Hillside House's design is clear. The Hillside House's second floor has two panels on the roof that can be lifted: the rear window cluster and the solar panels. This allows you to play with the second floor without removing anything from the house! In addition, the rear window cluster, along with the transparent balcony door, allow more of the second floor interior to be seen from the outside. In comparison, anything placed in the Family Home can only be seen through the tiny windows.<br></p><p>And how about the the Apple Tree House? It only has a small 6 x 9 attic with a small corridor that leads to the area right above the garage. Unfortunately, this above-garage area is all but impossible to access with your fingers.<br></p>
Again, the Hillside House is superior to the other two homes.<br><h4>Playable accessories</h4><p>The Family Home has a cute-looking duck and a picnic table. That's about it. It may have the most pieces, but a good number of those are 1x1 tiles that make up the walkway instead of more substantial pieces that could have been used for accessories.<br></p>The Hillside House has a lawn chair, a stunningly detailed barbecue, a dog, a minifigure, and a car. And of course, the doorbell. I personally love the doorbell, as it gives the set a bit of a charming personality.<br><br>The Apple Tree House has a basketball net, a lawnmower, and a mailbox. No minifigures or a vehicle to put in the garage.<br><br>It's no contest. The Hillside House wins by a landslide here.<br><h4>Conclusion<br></h4>The Hillside House may seem like an inferior Family Home at first glance, but it's actually far better designed once you take a closer look. As of this review date it's definitely the best Creator large house in terms of overall playability. The price/piece ratio may seem poor, but that's because this set didn't inflate the piece count by including many 1x1 tiles and plates. The Family Home has 146 1x1 tiles and plates; the Hillside House has 51.<br><br>It may be more expensive than the other two sets, but it's definitely worth it. Get it while you can!<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"LegoRuben","2013-08-20T06:30:23.453Z","Great set from 2011","Introduction<div><br></div><div>In Xmas 2011 this was top of my list. When I received it I soon realised why. There's plenty of playability from all 3 variations of the model. It includes a minifigure and a brick built dog, which makes it all the more playable. The sound brick is a nice addition but I feel it is unnecessary; it makes a doorbell sound an then a dog barking. It is a nice addition to MOCs though.<div><br></div><div>Main Build</div><div><br></div><div>Outside the house, there is a sort of car port which includes a car that seats 1 minifigure. The garden features a stone path that leads to the main area of the garden. This is set on a hill which makes sense hence the name. What impressed me most on this set was the BBQ. It's about 6 studs wide, and features two openings, one for the grille and another underneath for putting charcoals. Moving on, there is a table and chair and then a tree which can fall over.... That is about it for the outside. In the first floor, there is a reasonable amount of space to put furniture; I have managed to fit a kitchen, sofa and a TV in there with room to spare. This is what I love about creator houses: they leave the insides of the house bare, so you can let your creativity take control and customise it how you want. Up the stairs, is the second floor. There is plenty of space here, more than enough for a couple of beds and a chest of drawers. If you take a pillar out of the second floor, there is more space, however making the second floor unsturdy. There is also the addition of a small balcony on the side of the house. There is access to the second floor by a large window opening on the side, and also an opening solar panel to make it easier to play with. Of course with all creator houses the roofs come off to play on the first floor. The roof is in a bright red colour with plenty of roof slopes to use.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Other Builds</div><div><br></div><div>The other builds for this set look ok, but I haven't yet completed them. I got this set mainly for the first build. One of the alternate builds is a greenhouse, and the other is a villa which includes feature such as a pool.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Summary&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>All in all I recommend this set, it's available on eBay or amazon for about £50 although I believe it has been discontinued by lego.
