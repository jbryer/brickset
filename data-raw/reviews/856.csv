But truth be told, without it my buildings wouldn't be so easy to build or wouldn't stay up long enough to enjoy seeing my daughter play with them.
It's a MUST HAVE for Duplo builders.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Legonidas","2018-03-17T20:26:34.56Z","Essential piece for playing, and motor skills","<p>As you get kids, you will inevitably get/need some Duplo&nbsp;sets, the problem with Duplo&nbsp;sets is they look nice on the boxes&nbsp;with the&nbsp;drawn background, but they are of course not included with the set. You are only getting a few ( REALLY cute) figures and building blocks.</p>

<p>Without this building plate, the duplo&nbsp;set will just become a normal toy without utilizing Duplo&#39;s&nbsp;main draw which is building stuff and getting those fine motor skills going. The plate also gives more stability&nbsp;and structure to the building experience, and is also a good way to keep your Duplo&nbsp;somewhat together.</p>

<p>Pro: Compared to knockoffs you really see the quality of Lego. While this board stays flat (with normal use) some knockoffs come with a complimentary bend (because they are made too thin to save on cost) which make it hard for blocks to be placed on the board and&nbsp;impossible to keep them on it.</p>

<p>Con: Price&nbsp;and most kids don&#39;t play too long with Duplo. For this price one would expect more variation like roads/rivers or other terrain features. This would also entice people to buy more than 1.</p>
