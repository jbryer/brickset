<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>1) Biggest pro, it has both Lightning McQueen and Mater along with Finn McMissile. My son loves all three characters, especially McQueen and Mater so this set was perfect in that regard.<br></li><li>2) This set also includes several large plates and a couple 8x2 bricks along with some spinner plates and a nice crane element. The nice diversity of bricks allows for more creative building projects such as building a bridge for the cars to drive over.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>1) One exception to the piece diversity is glaring, there are 18 tan 1x2 bricks which is really too many of the same thing since preschoolers don't exactly stick with the model on the box.</li><li>2) Which brings me to the other con, too many tan blocks. Not exactly a color 2-5 year old kids are excited about. I concede that the model is more or less Big Ben and that is the appropriate color but it is just a bit excessive in this kit. That said, they did add a dash of yellow on top and a couple green bits for a tree/shrub so it isn't that bad overall.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, this set offers good value for the money when it comes to Cars characters and I would recommend it for anyone with a Cars enthused young man in their household.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
