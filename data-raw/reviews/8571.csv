"Harmonious_Building","2011-05-04T19:26:38.723Z","An excellent add-on to any Dragon Knights' base.","The name ""Blacksmith Attack"" seems to suggest that this humble blacksmith is being tormented by a marauding Dragon Knight, but with a face like that, I can't help but feel as though this particular blacksmith is in league with the Dragon Knights.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Regardless of how you'd like to interpret the blacksmith's motives or allegiances, Blacksmith Attack provides a compact ""domestic"" building to any medieval landscape. Its neutral and earthy colour scheme make it compatible with either the Dragon Knights or the Lion Knights, so I'll leave that difficult decision up to you.</div><div><br></div><div>The forge and water wheel work in a manner that is more or less identical in set up to the one found in the Medieval Market Village set, so Blacksmith Attack provides a smaller, cheaper alternative to the full-sized blacksmith found in that set. The little fireplace thing (which I'm sure has a technical name) to the side is also nearly identical in design. What is a little unusual is the choice of weapons that comes with the set - as far as I know, these are completely different from any weapons that I've seen in any Castle sets so far, which I found slightly odd since the Castle theme has had standard swords, bows, and daggers for years now. Fortunately, the Dragon Knight comes equipped with standard weapons, so if you don't like how the new weapons look, you can stash them on the weapon rack and forget about them. On the other hand, the set comes with a nice piece of black armour, a boon for the typically unarmoured Dragon Knights.</div><div><br></div><div>Two Minifigs, a host of weapons, and a complete building is well worth it for $10 - Blacksmith Attack will fit in flawlessly with the rest of your Castle display.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

<p>The actual Blacksmith's is a very nice, small version of the one in the Medieval Market Village, I now have both and I have set them up opposite each other to use them as rival businesses. I do have to say, although this one is much smaller it has more items to go with it for example all the brand new weapons, they are much more pointier and bold than all of the classic weapons;&nbsp;</p>

"brix","2011-06-04T06:29:00.1Z","A great set for the price","<p>I recieved this set in the post this morning having ordered it the night before on Amazon.com.</p>
<p>I didn't&nbsp;buy any Kingdoms sets until now as I have loads of castle sets but I thought if I take out the Dragon Knight, I could use it in my Castle theme.</p>
<p>I was really happy with the value of this set - you get some good parts for the price (like the bucket, the chicken, the mill&nbsp;and the new weapons) although I dislike how the weapons are a rubberised dark grey - not the plastic&nbsp;metalli dark grey of the Dragon Knight's sword and helmet.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the mill is simple but effective and works really well. The fire looks great alongside the hut and so does the weapon stand.</p>
<p>I am unsure as to why the set is called Blacksmith attack&nbsp;- it looks to me as f the Dragon Knight is dealing with the blacksmith however, this is not a set&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the set.</p>
<p>Overall, I recommend this set - it has great detail, a fair amount of playability with the mill and some nice parts.</p>

"AETerry","2011-06-14T16:42:34.49Z","Blacksmith Attack Review","<p>Wow is my reaction after having picked this up and putting it together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's only been one other Blacksmith set, 6040 from the early 80's that I'm aware of and it came out just a year or two before I started collecting the LEGOland theme sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also largely to the point that there aren't that many Castle sets that come out as ones that I want to get. And having an opportunity to get a Blacksmithy provides something very new and unique for my Castle collection in LEGO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a plethora of little accessories for this set from the bucket of water, to the weapons and armor, hammers. Some pieces such as the helmet, sword and armor are a dark metalic plastic, making for a good color choice for depicting metal. The only accessory piece I don't care for is the new style of bow &amp; arrow in this one. The little chicken is cute enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add then are some of the detail work with this set for the anvil holding a dagger on it. And then the Water Wheel, that when you turn it, turns the ""lever"" for the hammer so it can pound on the dagger or what ever is on the anvil. There's a fire place with red transparant pieces for the fire. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you've got two minifigures. One is the Blacksmith himself and I like the print job for his outfit, it's very different then any past peasant minifigures that LEGO has done for Castle. Then you've got the Dragon Knight or Soldier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At around $10, this is a very good set. It's a welcomed addition to my Castle collection given how uncommon &amp; rare Blacksmiths have been or most any other type of Castle set beyond Castles, Towers and Wagons/Carriages.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"Duckuss_Maxximus","2011-07-26T03:46:16.643Z","You can't blackmail a blacksmith","<p>Well where do I begin? This is a great set for anyone who enjoys Castle life but tires of knights in shining armor. The blacksmith has some fine wares ready for you to purchase. This set is a great starting point if you don't have the cheddar to dish out on Medieval Market Village (10193) and would like to make your own little village square.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>*minifigs (blacksmith, dragon knight)</li><li>*wares (armor, sword, battle axe, magic rod, sythe, bow &amp; arrow, knife x2)</li><li>*tools (hammer x2, anvil, kiln, bucket)</li><li>*Chicken! ^_^</li><li>*functional spinning mill wheel&nbsp;</li><li>*piece of ore</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>*a sleeping hut? ( i can't think of anything this set is really missing)</li></ul>
<p>Overall if Castles is your game then this set is for you. It is a great investment and the blacksmith is an invaluable member of any village. What's great about this set is that it'll fit well w/ any castle themes new or old and you can add wares from other sets too. If you own Wiz the Wizard (1746) (Wizard's Cart-1736) (Wizard Trader-2891), The Good Wizard (5614) or The Dragon Wizard (7955) you could have either one make potions/do alchemy as well. I gave the magic rod to my dragon wizard. It's better than a wand in my opinion. After that all you really need is a produce shop, an inn and a stable to store horses and you'll have a nice little village going! :D</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Tonebone0011","2011-06-07T04:18:31.933Z","Great solid set for any Castle enthusiast! Very flexible set","<p>They definitely went in a right direction with this set. I'm personally not a fan of carriages or attack wagons which are usually always in this price bracket. When I first saw this set, my initial reaction was that it seemed a little small for what you pay for. The more I looked into it, the more I realized how cool it looked, how cool its designed and how many cool things that is included in this awesome box!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Cool blacksmith, might be a lot of castle collecters' first blacksmiths</li>
    <li>Elite Dragon Knight, its always good to bolster your Dragon Knights numbers</li>
    <li>The watermill is just too sweet and the way it moves the hammer is pretty cool</li>
    <li>Lots of details and elaborate build, great for displays and also great to play with</li>
    <li>Unique weapons and tons of them. Armor plates are some of my favorite accessories. </li>
    <li>fits with virtually any castle set</li>
    <li>Great value in price</li>
    <li>Chicken &amp; Nugget, gold nugget!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Not much flexibility in customization or alternate builds.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a lot going on with this set with so many little details, this set tells its own story. It can be a remote little master blacksmith shop by a stream or the local blacksmith shop inside the castle. The blacksmith can either be working for the Dragon Knights or being forced to work against his will, perhaps because his daughter is being held captive for ransom. The chicken adds a sense of character to the whole piece. Overall, i recommend anyone to pick this set up if you come across it. Its fun to build and fun to look at on your desk or on display!</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

"Don","2012-05-23T02:15:36.93Z","Fantastic minifig weapons!","<p>This is a great little set and is a must-have add-on for a castle set.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>The best thing about this set is the unique weapons which include a short sword (which looks like the Master Sword from Legend of Zelda), mace, double-headed axe (which is a single piece, not two blades on a stick as with other sets), iron bow, and a billhook.&nbsp; Some other great parts include a pail with a swiveling handle, a chicken, a gold crystal, and a fantastic dark grey breastplate (which looks like hematite).&nbsp; Definitely a great set for minifig accessories.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>A double-faced blacksmith (smiling and mean) and a dark knight are present in this set.&nbsp; The knight has the newer great helm, which is cool.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Being a small set, the build is pretty straightforward.&nbsp; One thing I really enjoyed was the way the trip hammer is ""revealed"" during the build: you start with an anvil with a dagger on it, then you add a levered hammer and you think ""ah, you can animate the hammer by pressing down on the other end of the lever"", then you add the cam and think ""cool, i can just spin this rod and make the hammer go up and down"", and finally you add the water wheel to the camshaft and the logic of the model all falls into place.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is nice and compact.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, it would make a great addition to a larger castle set, or as part of a medieval village.&nbsp; I think the addition of a horse for the dark knight would have been nice, however.<br></p>

"Odeinoichus","2012-01-09T22:09:14.307Z","Blacksmith Arrival","<p>Set #6918 Blacksmith Attack: As a long time fan of LEGO's Castle Themes I must admit to having always expressed a desire to own more than just Knights and Peasants, an army after all doesn't run without arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I never actually knew about the original Blacksmith set, not until I found this site, as most Catalogues in the late 80's early 90's just showed pictures of the sets and never named anything. Or rarely did, as the case may be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a must have set even before I saw it in images on this very site, a Blacksmith set featuring someone who crafted tools and weaponry for my army of knights and their king. How could you possibly pass it up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model of the set is a small rustic looking blacksmith shop, and I do mean small, this thing looks like it would be out somewhere in a deep forest or perhaps just at the edge of cavernous filled mountain ranges. Just because it is small doesn't mean that it is a bad thing though. This set is aweinspiring, I recognized after a while that the water wheel and hammer gimmick was a repeated use of a similar build in Medieval Market Village (Which I have yet to acquire.) and that the mini-figure of the Blacksmith is actually a different colored version with identical printing from that set as well. (Hey, it's a bonus, now you can own the mini-figure without paying so much for the MMV.) But that doesn't detract from the set in the slightest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact I'd say it only improves it, knowing that they gave kids at retail a chance to own something as creative as the water wheel forging tool in a costly manner. Everybody deserves to experience the fun and playability of this feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from the smith's small work shop there is also a rack where he can cool the weapons after they have been finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are great, the Blacksmith as I already said is a re-release with new colors of the exact same mini-figure found in Medieval Market Village. The chief differences are that his torso and pants are now brown while his hood is black. He also has a double sided head and double sided torso printing. With some impressive detail. (This is my first time seeing it up close.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dragon knight Mini-Figure isn't new, in fact it's the same torso, legs and helmet we've seen on other Dragon Knights, with the head typically found on Dragon Soldiers, so no double sided print there. However it does mean that we can now get a set with a Dragon Knight and no Lion Knights, this and Mill Village Raid are worth doubling up on for the sake of padding out the slightly outnumbered Dragon Knights. (If you can afford it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set includes a group of tools that are brand new to Regular LEGO Themes, they are the weapon pieces found in the LEGO Heroica game. (Which I was not aware of until I watched the Brick Show review of this set.) Each weapon is smaller than typical Mini-Figure weapons, but they do look quite nice and are made of softer plastic so they can bend slightly while playing and not break.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have two small daggers, a short bow (I'm calling it as such since it is representative of a smaller sized bow.), a short sword, a wizard's stave, a wizard's globe topped staff (Both of which are used as tools for the Blacksmith apparently.), and a miniature battle axe (Which is currently being wielded by my Dwarves' Mine Defender Dwarf so that he can defend himself from attackers, seeing as how he has no weapons to do so in that set.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also two hammers, one attached to the waterwheel smith assembly, a gold hued crystal popularily introduced in LEGO's adventures themes specifically Aquazone, and a small bucket with handle. (This again is my first time seeing this new piece, which I assume was introduced with the PotC Theme, which I have yet to get any of.) The bucket is actually really quite clever looking and I'm glad that LEGO introduced it as the old barrel parts are admittedly not something a smith would use to store the water for cooling while stoking the weapons at the forge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly we have the new LEGO Chicken, in brown no less, a wonderful new animal piece that I applaud LEGO for introducing at last. Buildable birds are one thing, but having molded animal pieces that actually look like the real thing work a little bit better when placed next to Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I'd say this set is a must have item, the Heroica Weapons may not appeal to everyone, but they are a novelty look and some of them may even appear later on this year in the Lord of the Rings sets. I strongly reccomend this set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

Don&#39;t stub your toe on <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7952-1/Kingdoms-Advent-Calendar"">7952</a>&#39;s anvil. Listen to the water tumble over ANOTHER waterwheel in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10193-1/Medieval-Market-Village"">10193</a>. Let <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21325-1/Medieval-Blacksmith"">21325</a>&#39;s fire set your heart aglow. Don&#39;t trap your fingers in ANOTHER mechanical hammer in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31120-1/Medieval-Castle"">31120</a>.</p>

<p>Let us raise our tongs in celebration of the untrammelled imagination of the Lego designers&#39; consistent choice of the One True Profession for Castle-lovers around the globe!</p>
