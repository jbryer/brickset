"Crackseed","2011-05-03T23:59:09.773Z","Great Intro to Alien Conquest series!","<p>Let me be the first to kick off the reviews for Alien Striker! After much anticipation for the Alien Conquest/Space return, I snagged this set along with 2 others today from the LEGO store.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great Minifigs - Both the ADU Trooper with the new printing, color and his weaponry combined with the Alien Grunt make this the highlight of the small set.<br></li><li>Awesome little craft - Simple build but the styling of the Alien ship is just great despite the small piece count.<br></li><li>Decent MOC fodder for a small price - A good variety of small bits that can be used for different projects combined with the minifigs.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>For the price, I see no real cons with this set - solid figs and a decent ship for a tiny price.<br></li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>Honestly, even with this small set being the first one I've put together, it's only heightened my excitement for this new Space line. The minifigs are amazingly cool, the new blaster for the ADU trooper is just icing on the cake and getting a nice little craft for the Grunt to zip around on seals the deal. Well done LEGO!<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

He has a gun that looks like it's from Brickarms and his full outfit is a new shade of blue. It's just a bit brighter than regular blue. He has a new face with one side awestruck and the other in the fighting/constipated look. 2011, the year of constipated people! His visor is trans clear. The Alien is sweet! his head is packaged&nbsp;separately&nbsp;and is not rubbery. His torso and legs go together nicely, and could be used for a basic space dude. The back of his head has a weird brain pattern on it. No back printing. As someone else has said it, he looks like a grumpy frog. The ADU guy does have&nbsp;back printing. 5/5.</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Ship</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>&nbsp;The ship is a very nice design, and it has that new, futuristic feel to it. Near the back it has the nice sloped ridge pieces that first made their debut in Power Miners I think? It has&nbsp;excellent&nbsp;modding possibilities. It has the nice, rare red levers and two lime green 1x2 jumpers. Interesting parts include the 1x2 jumpers, purple stud, trans light blue stud, and of course the new gun and visor. The side of the ship is decorated with two 1x3 slope pieces connected to a bar holder. Not sure if that's the correct term for it. The back of the ship has two places for weapons, though none are included.</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Overall</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>7049 is a nice way of getting some cool figs, good pieces, and most of all a good set!

"Brickman193","2011-07-16T04:25:40.44Z","Invaders... FROM URANUS!","Many apologies for that awful joke - what can I say? I like the cheesy alien movies, and LEGO's Alien Conquest seems to be a homage to the B-grade sci-fi movies of the 50s. I got this set at Target during the annual toy sale, and it was $8 AUD. After a few insane months of engorged POTC and Star Wars sets, it was a price I was happy with.<div><br></div><div>THE MINIFIGS</div><div><ul><li>Really, the minifigs make the set because, well, there's not much else. You get an ADU soldier in vivid blue, and an Alien goon in green and purple. The printing on these minifigs is top quality - as one expects of LEGO - and the bright colours help Alien Conquest minfigs stand out in a crowd.</li><li>The helmet for the ADU soldier is I believe a new mould or relatively new (I'm looking at you, S1 Spaceman), and is all the better for it - who doesn't love helmets? The alien is really the highlight here with a new head that is appropriately odd and grotesque but slightly loveable in the tradition of LEGO people. The ADU soldier comes with a new laser gun that looks great, and a piece I hope to accumulate lots of in the future.</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>THE SHIP</div><div><ul><li>It's a simple design, no gimmicks, and in line with the bigger ships we see in the other sets. It's a quick build, easy for kids and adults, and it's awesomely swoosh-able (Swoosh is important, people).</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>SUMMARY</div><div><ul><li>So yes, if you're going to buy an Alien Conquest set, aim for one of the larger sets. If you want a great gift for a fellow collector, or a kid, pick this one up. I bought it in conjunction with 7049 Alien Striker, and the two sets look fine, with more to come. 4.5/5</li></ul></div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"legospongepotter","2011-08-19T22:45:57.873Z","Mini Battle!","7049 Alien Striker is a great set if you want to be introduced to Alien Conquest. My ten year old little brother bought this and he loves it. It's easy to play with and you get some very unique parts.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>ADU Soldier: </b>The ADU (Alien Defense Unit) Soldier is supposed to be the good human guy who wants to protect Earth. He's a very detailed Minifigure with a blue helmet with the visor that can't be moved up or down. He is double-sided. One of his faces would be his fighting look, a cross between a grimace and determination with lines on his faces to express his concentration and effort. The other is more comical, with&nbsp;his&nbsp;mouth open in surprise or awe and his eyes staring at the U.F.O or alien. His uniform/armor is blue as well. He has bullet-proof vest with ADU written in gold, which is a nice addition. He has some pockets printed on his legs. The back of his torso shows more of the vest and again, ADU written in gold in larger letters and underlined. A talking point among LEGO fans is the ADU ray gun, dark gray with the ability to fire two lasers at a time. It's a new piece and is very detailed.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>Alien Invader Trooper: </b>The alien trooper in this set is just as cool as the ADU soldier. The head piece is all one big piece. It's green with pinkish brains on the top/back of the head. There are huge&nbsp;black&nbsp;eyes under large green eyebrows and a row of four sharp teeth jutting from the mouth. The chin of the alien sticks out and the whole head is wonderfully a different shape than most heads. His head can turn side to side slightly. He's got a great torso with silver metal armor that looks very high-tech with purple markings and some green lights. If you look closely, there's a purple/black symbol in the middle of the armor. The arms are purple but his hands are green, and there's no back-printing, it's solid black. His legs have more purple markings. My only complaint is he doesn't have his own gun. Admittedly he does have the Alien Striker to help, but&nbsp;what&nbsp;if he needs to assault from the ground or his hovercraft explodes? Great minifigure anyways.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>Alien Striker: </b>The main build is the Alien Striker, which is basically a hovercraft. It's small and it's an easy build and uses green and gray colors to makes this look good. The sides are rounded and smooth and there are two red antenna pieces used as levers to control the two guns. In the back there is a couple transparent blue studs as rocket boosters or something like that. There are four studs in the center for the alien to sit in. Overall, while it's small, it's still pretty good. It's light and the weakest of the alien vehicles, meaning it's probably the must abundant vehicle. If you were to build an alien army, I'd recommend half a dozen of these.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>Overall: </b>It's a small set, so it pales in comparison to larger sets. Not a great set for adults or teens unless you are a) collecting the sets b) creating stop-motion c) creating an army. The set is good for kids, though. It's cheap ($5) and it provides what you need to stage a battle, two opposing forces with ways of defeating each other (ray gun. hovercraft). Basically, get this set if you need a cheap way to be introduced to Alien Conquest. I'm definitely getting more.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Building Experience: Really quick and easy with interesting techniques. 4/5</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Parts: You do get some great pieces like the ray gun, the alien's head, and even some purple studs 4/5</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Playability: Kids will love playing with this set 5/5</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Value for money: Worth the five bucks 5/5</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>4 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 18/20 = 4/5</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"NickBrick","2011-06-18T20:05:06.793Z","Much better than what I thought I was getting!","Okay, so I was walking around Toys r' us this morning, looking for the Hero factory 3.0 sets. I was disappointed that they didn't have them. So I was just wandering around, aimlessly in the Lego isle. I was so bored that I even read the little signs attached to some of the shelves. Thats when I saw it: ""Buy one get one 50% off!"". So picked up this and the speed boat from City. SO I'll probably review that one sometime soon too. Now, on to this review.&nbsp; <br><br>THE SPEEDER. From the look of the logo on the box, you can probably tell that this is a sc-fi theme with lots of flying saucers and ray guns. I suppose this is supposed to be a fly saucer of a sort. Its about 8 studs long, has two ""Ray guns"" in the front for blasting that poor ADU guy. In the back are two engines. Aka: two single round studs in trans light blue. The color scheme is really good. I must say it has that classic look. Like the UFO sets from the late '90s. When I saw this at the store, I immediately decided to pass it up. The speeder looked a little too... er, resourceful. You know. A cheap little extra to go with mini-figs. I'm glad now that my mom pushed me to buy this set instead of a CMF. Because I was wrong. I can really see this ziping around the city. Turning all in its path to ashes with it's ray gun thingy's . Ooooooo!&nbsp; <br><br>MINE-FIGS. So yeah. The min-figs ARE going to be the main part of a set of this size. The new ADU astronaut guy is realllly good! I'm pretty sure its a new color for mini-figs. He has great print, both on his front and back! And when he wields that new gun... Look out alien invaders!&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of alien invaders, I'm pretty pleased with my new little green dude. He has this immense head that kinda makes him look like he has bad posture. And some people might be a little disappointed that he doesn't have any print on his back. But I'm okay with it. The print is pretty cool, and sorta looks like the print used on the mini-figs in the UFO sets. Hmmmmm. <br><br>BOTTOM LINE. I would say that I like this set. It has one more figure than most five buck sets and is good for starting an Alien conquest. Which is what I'm doing. I hope I was helpful. hmmmmm goo. ( I hope you got the ""ask an alien"" reference there at the end)<br>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"AETerry","2011-07-21T18:25:49.403Z","Alien Striker Review","<p>I really wanted to like this set and find myself overall disappointed. And I shouldn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know at the $4.99 mark, it's a small set, there isn't much of a build and it's the minifigure(s) that will be the main draw. And that's why I went for this set. Size, price and minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ADU minifigure is alright, the drawback for me is the new style of helmets. I just don't like or care for them personally. But beings as I love the color blue, that's the biggest appeal to why the rest of the print and design for this figure works out. Plus the new little laser pistol piece he's holding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alien is grotesque in a cute way, yet very compelling and amusing. Almost like he could be a frog or Jabba the Hut's cousin. I do like him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vehicle build isn't bad, for a little cruiser that zips through a LEGO town or city attacking the ADU and abducting citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure if in the end I'll go for collecting the rest of this theme, but this little one is worth having a ""sampling"" of this theme.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,4
"davy_jones","2011-10-08T08:17:19.92Z","One up","<p>I call this review one up because I'm comparing it against another space theme, space police. I didn't like the alien design form that one and most of the set designs looked feeble. But come 2011 and lo and behold, alien invaders&nbsp;pops up. While my attention was focused on how the Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter sets would turn up, this one completely got me by surprise. It is my dark horse winner for this year's release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good:</p>
<p>1. The particular set is a cute unit. One goodie, one baddy and the game's slightly lopsided because the baddie is way more prepared. But that's when the fun begins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Color combination for both minifigs is awesome. This transcends to the whole theme actually. The chosen blues, red, green and purple go together very well (who would've thought?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. ADU human minifig has two sided head. Alien's head is a serious piece of achievement. A piece with a lot of 3D work and nice design touches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bad:</p>
<p>1. Being the archetypal capitalist consumer, I wish there was a bit more. Guns maybe?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get it folks. Even if you dont collect the space theme or Lego for that matter.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5

"Odeinoichus","2012-12-03T19:52:01Z","Alien Invasion Begins","<p>Set #7049 Alien Striker: LEGO introduces another brand new Sub-Theme for their Space sets and it is one involving Aliens, 50's Era Sci-Fi Classics and great looking Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>I was lucky to still find this set honestly I'm kind of a bit behind in my collecting and I may not manage to find any more from Alien Conquest. That being said let's discuss the model first then the Mini-Figs. The model in this set uses most of the 42 pieces, it is a tiny alien vessel designed for short range attacks and swarming the enemy to outnumber them. This set would be perfect to army build, provided you can still find it. There aren't too many rare parts, but there are some nice color choices in the parts.</p>
<p>Now on to the Mini-Figs, first up is the Alien pilot, this guy looks great and actually has some printing elements and colors seen in the Series 8 Alien Villainess. Obviously this Sub-Theme came first, the head is also more than likely&nbsp;a chinese made product as it does come in a small bag. There is no printing on the back of the torso, the head looks like a great alien head with a smallish brain in pink visible on the back of it. He's got this big frog-like mouth with teeth, sadly he doesn't include any weapons. I'm really diggin' the look of this Alien and think he'd look great in any kind of Space Collection.</p>
<p>Now the ADU member, I don't know if he has a name, is equally impressive. He's got a double-sided torso with armor visible and the ADU name on both sides. He's also got a belt and extra leg printing featuring pouches for supplies to defend earth against the Alien threat. He's wearing the helmet first introduced in the Collectible Mini-Figures series, with the grip point for him to hold it. He also has a double-sided print on his face, one frightened and the other with his teeth showing in a smirk of confidence.</p>
<p>He does include a weapon, the brand new double-barreled space blaster piece, which will see a return in next years Galaxy Squad sets. Overall I think this set is great for troop building aliens and ADU squad members, the model is quick to build and looks kind of ok, there are two clips on the rear of it perhaps so it can connect to one of the larger Alien vessels somehow. The only downside is that the alien does not include a weapon in-case he needs to abandon ship and defend himself from being vaporized. Awesome work LEGO.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

	Pros</h4>

		The purple, magenta, and green combo are odd, but really do work well.</li>
	<li>
		This may not have a real function, but it has major play value since the good space-man is in there.</li>

	Cons</h4>
<ul>
