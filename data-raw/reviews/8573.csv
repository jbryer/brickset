"PluffTed","2011-05-07T22:21:47.183Z","Move over Space Police!","<p>Just got this set in the mail after ordering from Toys R Us.com.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it had stickers (lol).&nbsp; The pieces&nbsp;are decent and there were a couple of new ones.&nbsp; The little alien ship is VERY tiny, but it's good addition.&nbsp; It has 2 lasers on the front and has&nbsp;2 cool light-green horn pieces on the back.&nbsp; The Alien Defender looks awesome.&nbsp; It kinda resembles a dune buggy.&nbsp; It has 2 flick-launching missiles on the sides and it has a turning anti-alien laser cannon on the back.&nbsp; The only problem I have with the Alien Defender is that the 2 guns (ones that alien conquest ADU Agents have) are pointed too much in an upwards angle, that it looks dorky.&nbsp; Of course, you can lower it a tiny bit but I still have a&nbsp;problem with its trajectory.&nbsp; Will recommend this set to any Lego fan and&nbsp;it's a pretty cool set for only $9.99.</p>

The little ship can actually fight fairly against the buggy since it has 2 guns and the driver (who looks awesome) carries his own weapon. The buggy is very well done,&nbsp;equipped&nbsp;with two&nbsp;missiles&nbsp;and two laser guns that can be angled to shoot down alien ships, or put in the drivers hands. The&nbsp;driver&nbsp;is gonna have a hard time seeing over that front part, but it's got some neat detail. The buggy also comes with two little pistols as what i assume are&nbsp;exhaust&nbsp;pipes.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cons: It's really more of a 7-8 dollar set but just a couple extra bucks isn't bad.</div><div><br></div><div>If you wanna check out the Alien&nbsp;Conquest&nbsp;theme, this is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;the set the start with.

"dragon_teenager","2011-09-05T18:00:54.347Z","A solid theme sampler ","As a longtime Space fan, I make a point to pick up the smaller sets in every Space (or in this case, Space-related) theme, so I don't feel like I've missed out on them. That was my reasoning behind this purchase, so my expectations were pretty low. Now that I've built it, though, I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised. The Alien Defender, as well as the rest of the Alien Conquest theme, has undeniable charm.<br><br>The Alien Defender is just your basic, if surprisingly well-armed, combat jeep. It sports the same blue/yellow color scheme that pervades most of the Alien Conquest sets. The model is solidly built, as nothing seems to fall off during play. Generally speaking, the Defender is pretty nice looking, even if it's a little bare-bones as jeeps go. It sports some nice detail for a set this size, including a healthy supply of cheese grates as well as some minor greeblage. It does carry a pair of flick-fire missiles (which in my opinion are just extraneous, since they don't really add much to the set). The turret attached to the back of the Defender has a nice range of motion, and it's designed so that it can't collide with the head of the driver (a familiar problem with some older sets). In my opinion, the turret adds much more playability than the flick-fire missiles. <br><br>It also comes with a little alien flier. This is pretty much a throwaway, unless you're desperately looking for some lime green horns. <br><br>There is a sticker sheet included, but it fairly small and thus easy to disregard. <br><br>The best reason to get this set is probably for the two minifigures, and the new pieces they introduce. The Defender includes an ADU trooper with a head that has orange sunglasses - I don't think this head is new, but I don't know for sure. You also get two of the new blasters, introduced exclusively for Alien Conquest. These blasters are very nice and I'm sure people will find good uses for them. <br><br>The alien is also quite nice, although it is probably my least favorite of the Alien Conquest minifigures. The torso lacks back printing, which is a little disappointing, and the head looks a little strange from the side (it protrudes too far from the torso). The alien includes one of the new ray guns, which is nice.<br><br><br>Overall, this set is best appreciated as a parts pack. It has a few nice pieces and two Alien Conquest minifigures (if you only want the figs, though, you're better off with the Alien Striker). The combat jeep is decent, but it's not anything to write home about. For $10, it's a solid purchase, but this theme has much more to offer at a higher price point. <br>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"davy_jones","2011-10-08T08:26:52.137Z","Take me to your leader!","<p>I loved the alien striker so much, I got this the very next day. Hhhhmmm, am I under some extraterrestrial hypnosis?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>1. Nice color combo, this time yellow and orange bits are included to the ADU soldier's vehicle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Both minifigs have good detailing. Another nice alien head piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Lots of weapons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons.</p>
<p>1. ADU soldier's vehicle has what I'm assuming to be a brown seat headrest below the laser turret. It doesnt really match the other colors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Some pages on my instruction manual had color variations on the pieces. Not a big error but its still inconsist quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Stickers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will still recommend this as well as the other sets in this theme. Go for it...</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AETerry","2011-08-05T01:56:55.393Z","Alien Defender Review","I find myself rather well taken with this little set. At the $10 range it's very good for the vehicle design of the main build. The car chassis or ""base"" I haven't seen in a while outside of some of my vintage 80's sets, so it was very amusing to see this piece back in use. Color-wise, the overall shade of blue works very well for the ADU group. Plenty of good use of pieces, another of my amusements is seeing the pistols used as part of ""spokes"" on the front of the car. I love the design for the front of the car and the turrent in back. Both of those are very decent and solid. It makes me close to tempted to consider a second set for this one, but I honestly don't think I'll pick up much more for the Alien Conquest theme then it's two little sets.<br><br>Next are two minifigures. One is a blue ADU minifigure. The shade of blue works for them and they're very fun to have and display. I'm still not convinced of the new helmet designs making the rounds, I much prefer the older ones with the visors that lift up. The other minifigure is the green alien with a green head that makes me think of the trandoshan aliens from Last Star Fighter. I am loving the new unique head pieces and the ability to show more aliens with LEGO minifigures.<br><br>The last thing for me is the alien's little saucer scooter. It does feel almost like an after thought and not very well thought out, but for showing lots of these little fast mini saucers flying around, it's good.<br><br>Stickers, you do have stickers. Love them or hate them, they are part of the set. It does make sense to a point having stickers for placing on pieces if you want to be able to mass produce elements and bricks and then use them in other designs. Given my understanding of how the LEGO warehouses and assembly lines work. And something else that I've noticed LEGO more generous with are extra pieces. Granted they're small pieces, but they're useful to have as it does seem that it's gonna be the small parts that go missing.<br><br>All in all, I really do like this particular set. It is tempting to consider the rest of the theme, but there are other themes I'm looking at trying to collect up first before moving to other themes.<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
"Bram","2011-12-31T06:01:52.633Z","Sci-fi version of a Willys Jeep!","This is actually my first ADU set, having bought only the alien's side of the AC theme previously. Since the build is pretty much straight forward and simple let's move on to the post build impression, since there is MUCH more to write about.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Post build impression</span><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><br>a. The Defender Buggy</span><br>I always love a high speed light assault military vehicle, seeing this set (and the price!), I knew this was destined to be my first ADU set. Despite its small size, it packs some innovative building techniques, especially around the nose area and the genius use of pistols for the front 'shocks'. <br><br>The rear portion is pretty much ordinary, with a small 2x2 turntable for the gun turret. The guns on the turrey can also be removed and handheld by the minifig. These ADU 'laser guns' are exclusive to the Alien Conquest theme to my knowledge, and pretty much sought after. You'll be glad that this set has 2 of them! There are additional flick fire missiles on the sides.<br><br>Much like a real military light assault vehicle..you can modify the rear portion pretty easily to accomodate many kinds of alien busting MOC weapons you can think off. I'm currently MOC-ing a plasma cannon, design inspired by the actual Bushmaster cannon in a USMC Humvee.<br><br>Stickers, well they've never bothered me, actually they're pretty interesting on this set. They're printed on transparant film, the ones on the side control panels have a 'carbon fiber' pattern, and if you look very closely there is a green intercom with minifig face in it!! Probably the commanding officer yelling ""Git ur a** down 'ere! Stat!""<br><br>Overall this buggy has that typical 'no non-sense, all business' look, with its bare open wheels,it looks aggresive even standing still!<br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">b. The Alien..scooter/hoverboard?</span><br>This set is generous enough to come with an extra Alien pilot riding a small idk, scooter, hoverboard or whatever you call it. Yes it's a bonus, it's small, but I think it's good and fun. You can even make the alien stand on it like a skateboard while shooting, that'll make a cool pose. To make a flight stand, simply insert a technic 1/2 pin underneath, and a clear 4L antenna.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pros:</span><br>-An excellent starter set.<br>-Innovative building techniques.<br>-Easily modified rear turret for different kinds of weapon.<br>-Pricewise...it's hard to resist owning several of them with differing weapon, and they look good in 'packs'..like a blue wolf pack.<br>-Great attention to details on the stickers, despite some people not using it.<br>-High/instant playability, you get a bonus alien foe inside.<br>-Looks REALLY good.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cons</span>:<br>- You need to buy few more to fight the aliens LOL...or just one with a HUGE guns.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Verdict:</span> 9/10<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ADDED</span> : Mods.<br>While retaining the original design, I added some features on the 7050<br>- Bigger tires,&nbsp; bigger guns and a trailer to carry the capture pod from the 7066 and 7067 LOL. This just to show that the 7050&nbsp; is easily modifiable much like a Humvee!<br><br><span>[img]http://i256.photobucket.com/albums/hh164/Out_Of_Sight1572/buggy1.jpg[/img]</span><br><span>[img]http://i256.photobucket.com/albums/hh164/Out_Of_Sight1572/buggy2.jpg[/img]</span><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-01T10:20:28.82Z","LEGO Space (Alien Conquest) - Alien Defender Review","This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on. This set includes a glider for the alien and an atv for the humans. The glider is okay. It doesn't have any play features but it's still fun to maneuver it. The atv is the best part of this set. It comes with a flick-missile on each side and a turret on the top which sviwels full 360°. I also like the design of the front. The only problem with that is that the figure can't really see out of the windscreen. On each side you can also see a revolver piece on the front. This is a very awsome suspension detail but I wish that this set had real suspension like the atv we've seen in set 6584 (Extreme Team Challenge) or the truck from set 6490 (Amazon Crossing). As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
