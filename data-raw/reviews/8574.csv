<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box art is nice, and most importantly, doesn't cheat. &nbsp;The set is as pictured, so you've got a fairly good idea of what you're building before you buy. &nbsp;</p><p>On the back of the box, you also get a fairly good idea of what you can expect for play features. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4>Parts</h4><div>This set comes with a couple of never-before-seen pieces: like a pair of light blueish grey 6x6 round corner slopes with a 33 degree incline. &nbsp;Other than that, there's some other pieces that are new to 2011 sets, like 3x&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=64727&amp;colorID=34&amp;in=A"">lime green flexible spike</a>. &nbsp;Besides the minifigure pieces, these are the only new moulds and colors that seem worth mentioning.</div><div><br></div><div>At 188 pieces, the piece count is a bit light for a $20 set, however after putting together the entire model, the 12 ""missing"" pieces are forgiven.</div><div><br></div><div>Also forgiven, is the use of stickers. &nbsp;8 stickers are included, and the ones on the UFO are a bit challenging to get aligned properly. &nbsp;Normally stickers put me off - After all, all the best space themes did just fine without them. &nbsp;What won me over was the ""WE'VE BEEN TO EARTH"" bumper sticker on the front of the UFO. &nbsp;Nice touch.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "">The Alien has front printing on both the torso and legs, but no back printing on either. &nbsp;The included ray gun that was first produced as an accessory for the S1 Space Man is included an a new color - flat silver. &nbsp;I think the Magenta arms are a new color as well. &nbsp;The head is hollow with the exception of the tube the neck fits into. &nbsp;All told, this alien has as much or more character as any of the Space Police 3 aliens.</p><p style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ""><br></p><p style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "">The Businessman has a dual-sided head, and the torso is printed front and back. &nbsp;He comes with a brown briefcase - fairly pedestrian, but I think that's the point.</p><p style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ""><br></p><p style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; "">The last minifigure part is a cute little alien, which LEGO calls a ""clinger"". &nbsp;It's got a single eye on a stalk, six tentacles, and what might be a tiny little stub of a tail coming out the back. &nbsp;The best feature - it fits on a standard head! &nbsp;The cuteness is sufficient that I could imagine this little guy as the main alien's pet, loyally following his master around, helping him enslave the human race.&nbsp;&nbsp;Good times.</p><p style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ""><br></p><h4>The Build</h4><div>There are two main builds in the instructions, the UFO, and the Tripod Legs. &nbsp;The build is easy enough. &nbsp;There's also something new - on the pages that refer to stickers, each sticker is&nbsp;labeled&nbsp;on the sticker sheet, as well as the instructions page. &nbsp;It's easier than ever to figure out where those darn stickers go. &nbsp;In fact, the new, labeled stickers are the only notable thing about the build process.</div><div><br></div><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; "">The completed model</span></h4><p>The play features are where this set really shines. &nbsp;</p><p>As indicated by the back of the box, The UFO can lift off of the tripod base - leaving the legs and rotating laser. &nbsp;The UFO also carries a detachable pod made primarily from two of the the trans-bright-green domes found in the 2010 Atlantis sets like the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8080-1"">8080 Undersea Explorer</a>.</p><p>What isn't clear from the box is that the legs have a reasonable range of motion, which lets you pose the model itself in various ways on flat ground. &nbsp;It also lets you keep it level on somewhat uneven ground (maybe two-three bricks high). &nbsp;The mechanism is simple, clever, and just enough to be interesting, without making the model unstable.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This was the set that had me most interested when I first learned of the Alien Conquest theme. &nbsp;That interest has not waned at all after building the set.</p><p>Having assembled this, both of the smaller sets in the theme (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7049-1"">7049</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7050-1"">7050</a>) as well as the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7067-1"">7067 Jet-Copter Encounter</a>, I can say with confidence that this is still my favorite set. &nbsp;It's certainly the most bang for your buck in terms of features and looks.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Crackseed","2011-05-04T15:15:28.207Z","Fantastic Alien Conquest set backed by a great price!","<p>I picked this set up yesterday - at 21.99 for nearly 200 pieces plus 2 minifigs and a brainslug alien pet, it's quite an awesome deal!</p><p>Right out of the box you'll notice the great minifigs - both the alien, the pet and the frightened citizen. While the briefcase isn't anything to write home about, the suit and face sell the civilian figure easily, combined with being able to stick the brainslug ontop of his head also or slotting him up in the capture pod on the back of the walker itself. The Alien looks to be one of the general ""grunts"" complete with a silver laser pistol. The pistol will sit in the cockpit with the Alien but it could have used an actual piece to secure it since it'll slide around otherwise. Easily moddable of course :)</p><p>The Tripod itself is a combination UFO and walker mount with a ridiculously cool beam laser pod in the middle. The build was enjoyable and despite the large stickers, the set would not look anywhere as fantastic without said stickers [if only it was printed bricks instead though - le sigh] combined with the choice of colors. It's a very stable set and quite posable, especially the nifty laser pod which can swivel in a wide range of motion and makes for some fun posing if you have other AC sets with ADU troopers to position around it.<br></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifigures</span> - Another great Alien grunt, an awesome Alien Brainslug pet and a civilian minifig with a blue suit and hilarious panicked face.<br></li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Outstanding build</span> - While under 200 pieces, the tripod is stable, looks fearsome and allows you to use it in various ways. Fly the cockpit off as a UFO, store the civvie in the capture pod, sit the tripod in various poses with the beam laser pod aiming at hapless civilian minifigs or fighting the ADU troops!<br></li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Awesome price value</span> - while it's technically shy of the golden price ratio, you're still getting a ton of value and cool for the 20 dollar tag.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Stickers</span> - While normally a con, I found these easy to apply and stick, including the curved UFO decals and they really highlight and complete the set.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Stickers</span> - Despite the stickers really helping to make this set pop visually, they are still...stickers. And we hateses them precious.<br></li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Loose laser pistol</span> - This is a really nitpicky thing, but it seems odd with the rest of the set being so well put together that the laser pistol for the alien sort of just slides around the UFO pod when not in use when a simple single clutch brick would have worked. Very easy to mod in on one's own, just an odd oversight in my opinion.<br></li></ul>
<p>In closing, this set only further highlights the all out awesome that is the new Alien Conquest line. While it's not a flagship model, for 20 bucks you could easily acquire several of these and create some great chaos in either a Space OR City setup. There's no reason you should avoid picking up a Tripod Invader - your future Alien Overlords will look kindly on you for it.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"andy87","2011-06-14T22:46:58.9Z","Amazing set and great for your collection","<p>I only have this and the alien defender, but alien conquest is already amazing. In this set, you don't actually get any ADU (alien defense unit) soldiers or&nbsp;vehicles, but the tripod more than makes up for that.</p><p><br></p><p>Pros: Great minifigs, first of all. The lawyer (that's what I assume he is) has a great scared face for when the alien thing latches onto him and for when he's running from the giant alien war machine right behind him, but also a good calm face for before the attack or after he's&nbsp;rescued. The alien is better than the little hunchback one from the alien defender, although his blaster is neat, it wasn't really needed in this set, as it's hard to fit in the cockpit. There's also that littler alien that can latch onto the lawyer. The tripod itself is a work of magic, with 3 guys and one that can basically aim anywhere on the ground to shoot any person that stands in its way! It has a pod in the back to hold the lawyer in and stands pretty tall. Great for display.</p><p><br></p><p>Cons: Not many, although for 20 bucks they could have included a small craft for an ADU soldier. You can fix this by getting the Alien Defender alongside this set, but then the poor soldier is pretty outgunned. While the alien latching onto the Lawyer is cool, you have to remove his hair to do so.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As you can see, this set is very very worth getting, with only a couple cons.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>5 out of 5!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"JDLego","2011-06-14T17:46:00.927Z","Best $20 I ever spent!","I picked this up at my local Wal-Mart for $19.99 and let me tell you, it was the best $19.99 I`ve ever spent on Lego! This set came with 166 Pieces, 2 Minifigures and 1 `Clinger`, the body of the set was great aswell. The minifigures you get are an alien invader, he has robot printing on this black pants and torso, with purple arms and lime green hands, with a seperate new alien head that is also lime green with brain printing on it. The head itself isnt a regular minifigure head, its slanted but cool. He also comes with a Grey Ray gun with a green tip light at the end. The other alien is small, its called a clinger because it can go on the minifgures head like hair or a hat, which like brainwash`s them or control`s them. Its lime green and has one eye. The other minifigure looks to be an office or bussiness man, comes with blue pants and torso that looks like a suit, face with glasses and black hair, and suitcase. The overall set is the tripod, it has three legs with flat bottoms, the middle piece of it can swivel and has another swivel attached to it as a laser. then the upper part is round like a saucer, has two lasers on the side, a green pod in the back to put the minifigure in, with two engines on the back aswell, it has a trans-clear pod on top with controls inside and enough room to put the minifigure and the ray gun inside. The pod on top also can detach from the legs and act as a space ship. Overall I think this is a great set to play with, lots of fun and playability, and a very good price for what you get. I would 100% recommend you buying this with your other AC Sets. Great job once again LEGO, Thank-you!",FALSE,5,5,4,5,5

The legs of the mech can be moved up and down a little bit and the cockpit does sviwel full 360°. The cockpit can be removed from the tripod as well. The windscreen does open and we get a few controls but there isn't much going on in there. The cockpit is big enough to put in the laser gun and the alien clinger.

"Bram","2012-01-02T00:12:42.143Z","What a way to stomp about the city...","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pre-build impressions</span>:<br>The box art really emphasizes the ""terror"" this walking mech behemoth projects towards earthlings..much like in the movie! The box itself is surprisingly thin and compact. The box contains 3 bags with no numbering, so it's best to put the parts in 3 seperate places to make searches easier during assembly.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Build impressions</span> :<br>Being my first time building a sci-fi themed Lego (I'm a diehard City and Technic only fan)I find the build surprisingly easy, but I did find some pleasant 'surprises' such as using a Technic driving rings for the rocket thrusters LOL. The first part of the build is the minifigs, on to the main craft/turret. The final steps are the tripod. There are some repetitive steps here..3 times to be exact, yup the leg assembly. Stickers are optional, but they really accentuate those riveted panels found on many classic spaceships, and the ""We've been to earth"" motto is just hilarious!<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Post build impressions</span> :<br>WOW..this set oozes classic straight from the 50's sci-fi flicks. With the transparent dome and the little green alien inside to top it off. The tripod walker looks intimidating because of its towering stature, although has a very limited range of movement to actually walk. But you can create some cool static pose though. The coolest features of this set is the detachable turret, which is actually a mid sized interceptor to pick up the human captive and store him in the trans-green bubble canopy compartment. The minifigs themselves are good, apart from the trooper alien, you get a double printed human head. The human minifig is typical white collared worker/accountant/businessman type. However he's also fitting to be panicking local city mayer LOL. So that opens up a wide role playing possibility for this character alone.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Collectible/Resale Value</span> <br>If you buy this set you get the head clinger/headcrab alien which cost up to $10!! Sell two of these, you can buy yourself another complete set.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mod possibility</span><br>Very high, you can add diferring tipes of weapon to replace the front laser dome. I'm thinking a more purposeful claw to 'catch' the human much like the #7065 Mothership. For an authentic strider look..replace the red 2L axle on each legs with longer 10L. It could go as tall as you want with a help of technic axle joiners, for a more convenient stroll over taller town buildings.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pros</span><br>-Unmistakable '50s design'<br>-Easily modifiable<br>-Cheapest AC set to come with the headcrab alien<br>-Reasonably priced<br>-As with any AC sets...these will turn any AFOL into KFOL!

"Gray_Ghost","2011-08-16T00:17:39.29Z","""Are you The Doctor?""...""What Doctor, Doctor Who?"" ","This set was excellent in the respects of playability and overall value but this review will delve into the meat of the set and analyze it in great depth.<br><br>The Figures: <br>This selection of figures, while few, will appeal to a lot of people. For adults; this selection includes a new civilian for your city while still looking perfect in the alien conquest world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Sci Fi fans; this is where my title comes from, one of the reasons I bought this set was to get the businessman figure which, in my opinion, is the closest thing that we will ever get to a tenth doctor figure. He has a dark blue pinstriped suit (season 4) and also hat suspiciously looks like a sonic screwdriver in his top pocket, brainy specs, cocked eyebrow and a smug smile often seen on David Tennant. This set also features an alien ""grunt"" which has a remarkably printed body and legs and also highlights in magenta. The clinger is attached to the minifigures head when the head piece/hair is taken off and somewhat looks like a dalek organism. For children; it is an alien and a victim, need I say more.<br><br>The Set:<br><br>-The Legs: They are comprise of technic pieces and, while they do their job, they make the legs look rather spindly and weak. They are all attached with a part that (I think) was first seen in the scarecrow bi-plane set as a part of the rotor.<br><br>-The pod: this is a place composed of less than ten parts where you store the human. Oddly enough, you can not store the person while the have the clinger, as the eye makes the pod unable to shut.<br><br>-The cockpit: This section also functions as an escape pod but how it the alien supposed to steer. I have seen bumper cars with a more sophisticated control panel. they weren't even lacking in room they just gave us two levers and more room than a VW van has to lie down in. It has a nice turntable that allows for 360 degree rotation and a swiveling gun with the cup and socket joints seen on the front of 7676 Republic Attack Gunship. i would have preferred the bubble on the top of the cockpit to have been a neon color but that probably would look a bit to similar to the pod.<br><br>All in all it is a fine set, it should have been priced at fifteen dollars but the design, Alien soldier, clinger and the ""Doctor Who"" figure more than makes up for it. In my opinion buy it now, for any sci fi fan, or lego fan.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5

<p>The tripod invader is the first set from the new alien conquest that&nbsp;I have bought and&nbsp; have to say&nbsp;I&nbsp;am hooked , the alien tripod is very 50s scifi in design witch I have to say I didnt think&nbsp;I would like it&nbsp;but I love it . The way the tripod spilts into a space ship is an great idea that adds alot to the playable . The two sided head of the business man is a nice touch as well as the alien trooper but my fave is the little alien head clinger I think it is a great minifig (i know most people dont class it as a minifig but what the hell ). The price is a very low price of £18.00 , if this set was a star wars set the price would be alest £30.00 so how can we ask for better . The build was pretty easy so i have only givent it four stars but that is a minor thing. Maybe an ADU officer with the set would have be nice but that would have put up the price .</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2011-11-21T22:24:26.54Z","""For neither do men live nor die in vain...""","<div>I have to be honest: I have little interest in the Alien Conquest line, and, having purchased Tripod Invader, my interest in it has only marginally increased. This has nothing to do with Tripod Invader being a bad set - which it isn’t at all - but rather my overall opinion on the line as a whole. I was actually initially excited to learn that LEGO was coming up with a Space subtheme that actually involves the “real world”, so to speak, but I think the final execution from the “human” side of things sort of left me a bit underwhelmed. Also, most of the alien sets in Alien Conquest kind of seem like cheap knockoffs of the truly intimidating <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=UFO"">UFO</a> line from some years back, which I loved for its harsh colour scheme and inscrutable cyber-alien-type characters - THEY seem like the kinds of folks that people will run in terror from, as opposed to Alien Conquest’s more generic “little green men”.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But, for all the wonderful things about the UFO line, they do not have a tripod machine, and I love tripod machines. Also, this set was on sale on Amazon for a little while and I had to use my points for something, so I had to make sure that that something was utterly frivolous. There you have it, even though you didn’t ask for it: the reason why I bought this set.</div><div><br></div><div>Two Minifigs come with Tripod Invader: a goofy alien goon and a hapless accountant guy waiting to be stepped on (whom I have since absorbed into my Bank &amp; Money Transfer (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3661-1"">3661</a>) display, actually). Additionally, you get a weird facehugger alien-type thing that is perfectly evolved to cling onto the heads of Minifigs, which is sort of cool and horrifying at the same time.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There’s nothing else by way of weird accessories or other bits and bobs here: you get the tripod and that’s it. When fully assembled, the tripod actually has a pretty impressive height, towering over the buildings that come with City Corner (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7641-1"">7641</a>) as well as over Bank &amp; Money Transfer’s titular bank. All three legs have the exact same build, which is a little boring but unavoidable, although the end product is worth it since the legs are surprisingly mobile, allowing for quite a number of configurations. Construction-wise, however, much of your attention will end up being focused on the spaceship at the top of the legs.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, that is a spaceship, which detaches from the legs in a pinch. Again, it’s highly reminiscent of something that one might find in the UFO line, with the added frustration of having stickers that need to be applied on a curved surface. I mean, why? UFO didn’t bother messing around with stickers, so why does Alien Conquest? Whatever the case, the spaceship is adequate and is more for playability than anything else, since it wouldn’t be much of an invasion if one just takes out the spindly legs to disable the whole machine. As a side note, the spaceship is roughly to scale with the Space Police Raid VPR (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=5981-1"">5981</a>), so if your town needs a slightly more credible-looking intergalactic defence force, you might consider that guy as your starting point.</div><div><br></div><div>And speaking of a defensive force, what may be a frustration for some, I suppose, is that the set comes with no Minifigs representing the Earth Defence Initiative or whatever those guys are called, but it wasn’t an issue for me because I like their light blue colour scheme even less than the purple-and-green one that the aliens have. What I do like about Tripod Invader - and this really is a big plus for me since I know I do sound like a Negative Nancy in this review - is that it scales very well with the LEGO City sets, which is the whole point of the Alien Conquest line, I suppose. I would have a hard time believing that this set is anything but a deliberate homage to <i>War of the Worlds</i>, which you can actually read <a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/1002/"">here</a> for free and see if that inspires you to kick-start a martian invasion of your own design.</div><div><br></div><div>The bottom line here is that I picked up this set because it fits in very well if you have an existing LEGO City, so, if you like the idea of an alien invasion, this set fits the bill. Alternatively, as mentioned, this set does go pretty well with the new Space Police sets, which I find to be much more attractive than the ugly blue colour scheme of Alien Conquest’s human protectors. I, personally, am waiting for my Marvel superheroes who will use the Alien Conquest folks as a stand-in for <a href=""http://marvel.wikia.com/Secret_Invasion"">Skrulls</a>.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5
"Thehuzman","2011-08-15T11:25:40.497Z","Best set per unit of cash spent EVER!","<p>Got this set after reading the reviews on here, and some heavy lobbying from the kids.</p>
<p>It was priced at just under £18.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been many reviews debating the pro's and cons, so won't do that here just general impressions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly the thing looks fantastic! Really alien, and War of the Worlds looking, while still retaining an overall shape that you can relate to.</p>
<p>Despite looking pretty fragile it holds together really well, just the death ray flouro green bit being a bit easy to knock loose.</p>

<p>The set has created a number of problems in the household though as now, nobody wants to be the ADU, as they do not get to abduct lawyers, and secondly I am poorer by another £18 as the other twin MUST have a tripod.</p>

"Graysmith","2011-12-30T22:20:54.073Z","A Most Brilliant Invasion!","<p>As someone who primarily likes the simpler LEGO of my youth (Town/Space of the 80s) and isn't overly impressed with many of their present-day products I must admit this set really blew my mind. Though alien saucers aren't a completely new concept for LEGO, this tripod is really above and beyond anything they've done previously. It's not a particularly complex build, and it gets a bit repetitive since a big portion of it are three identical legs, but the end result looks so good that it doesn't matter. Also, as much as I would've loved to have had this as a kid, I think I appreciate it so much more as a grown-up who gets all the classic alien movie tropes a la War of the Worlds and old flying saucer movies of the 50s.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Great attention to detail (like the spikes on the tripod feet that didn't NEED to be there but make it look a bit more menacing and the neon green tip of the alien's ray-gun).</li><li>The neon green/purple/grey colour scheme.</li><li>Mind-controlling alien monster!</li><li>Human minifig, whose beautiful pinstripe navy suit deserves continued life in the City theme.</li><li>No human spacemen (since I don't care for the way they look anyway).</li><li>The head detaches from the tripod legs to become a spaceship.</li><li>..And pretty much everything else that isn't covered under Cons.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>You can't really make it walk, or change the height a great deal. It has some flexibility, but don't expect to much.</li><li>The rotating turret could've looked more like a ray-gun rather than just a ball with a ""laser beam"" sticking out of it.</li><li>No place to attach/stow the ray-gun when the alien is busy operating the tripod.</li><li>Stickers! (I left them off and it looks just as nice without them though.)</li></ul>
<p>I'm not a huge fan of the Alien Conquest series as a whole (the human ""defence force"" side of the theme primarily, whose bright blue colours just feel a bit too cheery and just don't go well with the alien colours), but this tripod should be a must-own for any fan of LEGO, even those like me who have no real interest the Alien Conquest theme in general. This tripod makes me smile every time I look at it and as such was worth every penny.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"tomalphin","2016-05-10T05:41:41.83Z","Well above Expectations!","<p>This set was one of many that didn&#39;t interest me much in a bulk purchase. &nbsp;It was complete, so I put all the parts aside to eventually build and sell.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are clear and easy to follow. &nbsp;The model on the cover looks impressively intricate and large for the 165 piece count.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Amazingly good parts with nice technic parts and interesting colors. &nbsp;not very many common parts at all!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The alien is cool, and the alien blob that attacks the stockholder is awesome. &nbsp;(Some fun political overtones in this set.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The legs are repetitive, but unique construction with the technic elements which achieve multiple angles due to a 1 stud offset at top and bottom of the bent sections.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Impressed me to the point that I almost want to keep it. &nbsp;It has a lot of less common parts that I don&#39;t own in quantity. &nbsp;I love when a set exceeds expectations!</p>

"boneskull","2014-08-31T06:04:24.533Z","Good Enough To Make Me Want To Spend 10 Minutes Writing A Review","<p>This is my first Alien Conquest set. &nbsp;I found it at a local LEGO reseller, new in box, for $25. &nbsp;I&#39;d say I got a pretty good deal, because this set is great.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box was in really good condition considering it&#39;s 3-4 years old. &nbsp;I don&#39;t really care about boxes though. &nbsp;I did not notice any errors or ambiguity in the&nbsp;instructions, so that&#39;s always a plus.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of unique pieces in this one. &nbsp;Especially the green facehugger thing. &nbsp;Love that guy.</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t many pieces in this set; they are mostly large pieces. &nbsp;But not the &quot;easy start&quot; large pieces in the new City sets (yuk). &nbsp;I&#39;d never seen the lazer (yes,&nbsp;with a &quot;z&quot;)&nbsp;beam cannon base, the round dome, or the three large pieces that form the body. &nbsp;I bet the lazer beam base could be used on a killer mech MOC. &nbsp;Also the black upper leg parts were new to me, the parts which connect it to the body, and finally the green knife-looking things on the feet.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Always glad to have an unfriendly&nbsp;lime-colored&nbsp;alien with an overbite. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The man&#39;s head has two sides--one where he&#39;s minding his own business, not noticing there&#39;s an alien invasion--and the grimace of abject terror when he realizes he&#39;s being taken in an alien pod to be probed.</p>

<p>And the facehugger hat. &nbsp;That&#39;s probably my best hat. &nbsp;Or the lizardman hat. &nbsp;Can&#39;t decide.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>My main interest in LEGO is building. &nbsp;I will disassemble sets just to assemble them again if the build is good. &nbsp;I think I may do that here.</p>

<p>The build was strong, but it didn&#39;t blow me away--usually I&#39;m fascinated by Technic builds (most recently the build of&nbsp;42022-1 was impressive), and this set had many of those elements. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The worm gears add great texture to&nbsp;the mid-leg. &nbsp;The feet were a bit strange (with the lime jumper and 1x1 round purple plate), I couldn&#39;t tell what&#39;s supposed to be going on there. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This thing looks killer. &nbsp;Obvious &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; influence, plus a liberal dose of camp. &nbsp;It swivels around in places, and you can put a minifig in the &quot;pod&quot; on its butt,&nbsp;but I don&#39;t really fiddle with my sets after I&#39;ve built them unless playing w/ my kid. &nbsp;It looks more expensive than it was. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My only beef is that the legs are stationary. &nbsp;Using a shock absorber (731c06) at the intersection of leg &amp; foot might be cool so it could bounce around, but given the weight of the body I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d accomplish bendy, spindly legs that&#39;d stay posed.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Because this set is so great, I&#39;m going to try to get my hands on at least one more set (7052-1, which also gets great reviews) from the series. &nbsp;I love evil aliens, be they robots, bugs, little green men, lizard people, whatever. &nbsp;</p>

<p>When building this I was thinking, &quot;would kids appreciate&nbsp;this?&quot; and &quot;isn&#39;t this kind of scary if you don&#39;t get the humor?&quot; &nbsp;I think these are valid questions, which may be why LEGO didn&#39;t release many sets in this theme.</p>

<p>If you can find this, don&#39;t pass it up.</p>

"Itellyounothing","2019-08-29T20:07:13.56Z","War of the Worlds!!!!!!!","<p>This set is brilliant. The only way I could love it more is if the legs were fully posable.</p>

<p>Building experience - In line witht he rest of this theme, the upper fuselage / pod is very much like building a classic space ship apart from the little ccapsule for kidnapped minifigs on the back. THe lower portion, the legs and ball mounted laser turret, was interesting and different and thanks to the tripod deliver great stability.</p>

<p>Parts - Nothing special about these really. i like the fifties style round clear cockpit and the green clear capsule is a nice look filled with terrified captured minifigs. The little head sucker alien is neat.</p>

<p>Playability - On it&#39;s own quite limited. The temptation to add an ADu soldier or swap out the minifig civilian must have been considerable. But combine this with any theme and you have a high tech death walker striding through your city, castle, harbour, space base..... You name it. The Tripod Invader looks dramatic whatever it&#39;s environment. It can&#39;t hide easily but when it comes to kidnapping a helpless populace, this is the way to go. My space base has two of them striding across some the moon plates looking terrifying. If your ADU does manage to damage a leg, the saucer section detaches easily and&nbsp;flies away keeping it&#39;s pilot safe and returning it&#39;s new minifig&nbsp;slave to the Alien Slaver Fleet high above.</p>

<p>Value for money - Hell yeah. For the size and presence these offer alone. They stride across the battlefield zapping insolent soldiers and scooping up helpless civilians.</p>

<p>Yes. Yes a thousand times yes. Did I&nbsp;mention I have two.</p>
