"Kalhiki","2011-05-07T16:24:38.523Z","Great set for a great line.","<p>My first Alien Conquest set, and boy am I proud. This thing simply screams Aliens and makes me want to watch an old&nbsp;alien-related movie. But enough of that, let's get to the review!&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is very nice. The art is fantastic and certainly catches the eye. On the front it shows the set, and advertises that it has an ""Alien Pilot!"" and a ""Light!"". The top has the minifigures included in the set, and an actual size showing the farmer's pitch fork (odd piece to show in my opinion). The back, as usual, shows the set's features. The UFO&nbsp;shows the abduction feature which I'll cover later.</p>
<p>There's only one booklet for this set. It goes through two building steps (one for each bag): one for the bottom of the ship, one for the top. The instructions&nbsp;also have a nice green background on the building steps. The back advertises the other sets currently out in the line.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts that come in this set are nice. First of all, you get the nice rounded edged disc piece-thingies. These come in two sizes: The larger, light grey ones, and the smaller dark grey ones. Another nice piece is the cockpit being a clear dome. The cool pieces even&nbsp;go as far as the Minifig accessories. The ADU guy has a sweet looking gun, and the Alien has the gun first seen with some of the Collectable Minifigures.</p>
<p>There are also some nice purple pieces and trans-lime with this set that can't go unmentioned.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Farmer: This guy is pretty generic. He has patched pants, some overalls, and wheat sticking out everywhere. and he also has back printing.&nbsp;I was a little dissapointed to see had no two sided face. He's stuck with a frightened face (even though the face is nicely designed with the mustache). He also comes with&nbsp;a pitch fork which is a nice accessory.</p>
<p>ADU Guy: Detail. That's all I have to say. The legs&nbsp;have a nice armored look along with the body.&nbsp;The body mainly has armor on the chest and on the back (yes, back printing). Under the chest armor seems to be some sort of&nbsp;zippered wear. Maybe a rubber suit to protect them from alien slime or whatever.&nbsp;His head is double sided. This guy&nbsp;has a big mustache and seems to be&nbsp;pretty old. His helmet is the same as those in the later waves of SPIII only in the new blue color.</p>
<p>Alien Pilot(!): His pants have a nice robot-looking print on his left leg. His torse is also pretty cool with tubes and a chest plate (printed on). There also is no back priting. The head is freaky. It sticks out giving a hunch look, and has what appears to be brains on the back. He's got a massive underbite and buggy eyes.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>There really isn't anything special with the build. It has two stages, and some stickers. The most interesting part was probably hooking up the light feature, and making the underside and inner UFO.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Before I get to the UFO, the set also comes with a flick-fire missile launcer, and two road blocks. Not much to be disscussed.</p>
<p>The UFO&nbsp;is fantastic. It has the appearance of one of those old Sci-Fi UFOs&nbsp;only with a modern feel. It's very sturdy and will take on lots of play. It does, however seem a little small for the price you pay. But that's made up in playability. The light feature is cool and when you shine it, the light passes through spiked pieces for the abduction feature which makes the light look like crosshairs.</p>
<p>Speaking of the abduction feature, it is hilarious. You stand a Minifig on the ground, and put the UFO on top. When you pick it up, the Minifig is stuck in the UFO by four rubbery pieces. However, it does leave something to be desired. Only the Minifig's head get stuck inside, but it does stay in well.</p>
<p>Do I have any problems? Well, the inside of the cockpit is a little bad. But that's mainly due to the light feature. I also wish this set came with an ADU vehicle, but that would have probably raised the price.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, I highly recommend this set. The UFO is very cool and is fun to fly around. The minifigs are great and good for army building (the Aliens mostly. Though an army of frightened farmers would be funny). The overall appearance totally screams a classic UFO. If you pick this up, whether you play with your sets or display them, you'll be glad you did.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"TheNick","2011-05-08T00:27:10.26Z","Great Set","<p>Just purchased this from a Lego store and I must say it is one of the coolest space sets to come out in a while.&nbsp; With 211 pieces it comes out to about $0.14 cents per piece.&nbsp; A little expensive, but the minifigures, playability and light brick make up for it.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This set is for ages 7 - 14 so the instructions are easy to read and the bags are numbered.&nbsp; The box could be a bit smaller, but the box art is really cool.&nbsp; It does a good job illustrating the features of the set.&nbsp; It also has a city in the background, which is cool if you are into the City Theme.&nbsp; These sets don't really fill out of place in a city like previous space sets would.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The pieces are fairly common.&nbsp; The color scheme is purple, green and neon green.&nbsp; Comes with a small sticker sheet.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs on are great.&nbsp; Comes with a farmer, space ""agent"" and alien.&nbsp; The aliens are unique to this series and very cool.&nbsp; They have a standard minifig body with a unique head.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is definitely suited for the younger fans.&nbsp; Took me, an adult, about 15 minutes to put together including attaching the stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This set is sturdy which is nice for the younger kids.&nbsp; The light brick is red and you can flip it on and off with a little lever behind the alien pilot.&nbsp; There is a hole in the bottom of the unit where you can actually ""abduct"" your minifigs.&nbsp; It has rubber tentacles that will grab onto the minifigs if you hover over them.&nbsp; Very cool feature.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4>This is my first Alien Conquest set and definitely will not be my last.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"Bram","2011-12-29T04:27:24.1Z","Do you believe in UFOs...?","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall impression</span><br>Much like the #7051 Tripod invader which I got previously, the #7052 UFO
 has that instant appeal, because it look so familiar in our mind..a 
true definition of a flying saucer.&nbsp; <br><br>The build is initially flimsy but very solid once completed as others had noted. The whole saucer is quite compact but not small. <br><br>The abduction function is neat, and adds a huge playability. The 4 pointed rubber strips always have a firm grip on the abductees, as long as you place them in the middle.<br><br>The light switch is very effective, while not pretty, but I can't see any better setup, so it's actually a well thought out design. The light brick itself is surprisingly bright, forming an ""X"" pattern when shined on flat surfaces. <br><br>The 3 figures that comes with this set is actually pretty good and full of character:<br>-An old 'veteran' ADU officer (double printed head)<br>-A pretty scared farmer (has a nice printed front &amp; back torso and legs)<br>-Alien pilot<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Playing tips for childish AFOLs and kids</span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">:</span><br style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">The light bricks isn't just there for show...when shined, the X cross hair helps you align the abductee's head or torso right in the center of the grasping claws..for an effective abduction (grip!). That way the UFO doesn't have to go for a turn-around in the event of failed abduction, and giving the ADU a second chance for a shot down.</span><br><br><span></span><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pros:</span><br>- Huge playability<br>- Very solid build<br>- Nothing beats having a flying saucer in a Alien theme.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cons:</span><br>- Slightly pricey<br>- Doesn't come with a flight stand for display...UFOs look best when they're defying gravity if you know what I mean LOL.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall</span> : 9.5/10.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mods possibility</span> :<br>- A flight stand...here's a simple one I made earlier from leftover parts.

"ryanaitch","2011-06-05T22:03:49.247Z","One of the best play features ever?","<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set may not look&nbsp; that stunning in terms of parts for a $30 set, but there are some gems in here. I love new Lego colors, so the dark azure ADU soldier is the highlight for me. This set also has a new 8x8 dome (half-sphere this time, not pointy like the Robo Attack one), Mars-Mission-style quarter-round saucer pieces (and new smaller versions), and a pitchfork (slightly rubbery/bendy this time, and of course in new brown). The lime and purple parts are nothing we haven't seen before, but they're always nice to have more of.</p><p>Oh, and the Stafford gun! This set has one! :D (Also a new color of Collectifig raygun, the new flat-silverish color.)<br></p><p></p><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>As I mentioned ^there^, the ADU soldier has a really marvelous blue color that we haven't seen before. He's heavily printed, but the blue is still visible ;)</p><p>The farmer is wonderful -- even better than the red/green one from CITY a couple years ago. He's printed on both sides with sand-blue overalls, matching the patched sand blue pants.<br></p><p>And, of course, the alien! With magenta (Lotso's color) arms and dark purple printing, he's very stylish. The head has brain printing, but the interesting thing is that it sticks out enough that it can practically swivel 360° around the neck without the arms getting in the way! Very unique.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>The build itself isn't remarkable, and the saucer can fall apart easily until about halfway up, when the parts are secured better. The cockpit is a little gappy, and not all that pretty. That's excusable, though, because:<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4>This set has one of the most original (and fun!) play features I've ever seen in a system set: the Abduction Function! On the center of the underside of the ship is a cavity with four rubber stalks (remember Exo-Force Jungle/Assassin Droid BP?) meeting at the middle. When the ship is placed over the farmer (or even the alien, if you so choose...), the rubber tips bend up and catch on his hair, picking him up with the ship! If that weren't enough, there's a light brick taking up much of the cockpit that shines down through the cavity creating a creepy crosshair-esque pattern on the ground.<br><br>I'm not impressed with the lever that activates the light brick, though. It's a wonky Technic construct that sticks out the back of the cockpit, and it's sort of hard to press/keep pressed.<br><br>The ADU barricades seem kind of silly -- they're so small! What could they do in an alien invasion?<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This set has some great parts, and a great play feature. Several of the good parts are available in other sets, but the farmer is unique. The pitchfork and dome are available in one other set each (the mill village and alien mothership, respectively); short of Bricklinking those individual parts, this set is a much more affordable way to get them.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4

"giraffefreckles","2011-09-07T13:21:05.753Z","LOOOOOVE This Set","<p>First of all, I must say this set more than lived up to my expectations.&nbsp; After the flimsy fiasco of an Atlantis Turbo Sub, I wasn't sure what&nbsp;I would&nbsp;experience&nbsp;in my next set.&nbsp; The idea of a round UFO was scintillating, and the actual result is both sturdy and interesting.&nbsp; The alien grew on me.&nbsp; He's joining his comrades from Minifigure Series 3&nbsp;and from the Alien Striker box that's 45% off on Amazon (but really shouldn't have been that expensive to begin with.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the packaging, you can see at least three sticker corners starting to curl up if you look carefully.&nbsp; Vindication for sticker-haters and bad advertising for LEGO!&nbsp; Note that the actual spaceship is just a tad smaller than the front art spaceship on the package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The instruction manual was curled up with even curlier corners.&nbsp; I'm starting to wonder if this is deliberate of LEGO so you can't miss the&nbsp;rolled-up manual that comes flying out of the box when you shake things out; neah, the assembly people just aren't paying attention.&nbsp; Inside, I see a new-to-me plea on recycling your set instead of throwing it away -- laudable social responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build of the spaceship is kinda flimsy and unstable until you get to key stabilizing plates about 1/3 of the way through -- and then it gets even&nbsp;better from there.&nbsp; The toothy contraption for abducting the farmer is a&nbsp;total giggle -- it really does hold his torso in.&nbsp; However, when you pull the farmer back out, he loses his hair inside the spaceship.&nbsp; Yeah, my hair would fall out too if I went through this experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the only thing I find significant to complain about (and barely that) is the gimmicky setup to turn on the light brick.&nbsp; It's just ugly, takes too much space in the cockpit [poor crowded alien pilot], and well -- couldn't they have engineered something better than a bunch of rods and washers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the barricades and little missle launcher -- meh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, one of the spaceship's stickers says, ""Area 51"".&nbsp; I got a total kick out of that.&nbsp; So, maybe the alien and his ship are escapees from the desert underground, eh?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, there are a few extra pieces -- the most significant of which is the transparent-lime-green antenna.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Love the purple, lime green, and azure(ish) blue color scheme.&nbsp; The transparent-azure ""buttons"" underneath the spaceship are a nice touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would highly recommend this set to stimulate the kid in you (or if you're already a kid.)&nbsp; Am looking for Crop Circle Visitation next...</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>Right. The box. Here's the thing. <b>IT'S STANDARD. </b>Do I really have to go through all the details the box says when everyone already knows? Nah, just kidding, I just said that so I could bold words. The somewhat misleading front shows a farmer being sucked into the underside of a big UFO. Ooh. Scary. The ADU lackey is shooting the ever-loved flick-fire missile and blasting at the alien. The alien says, ""My back hurts."" It's set on a back road next to a field with the city in the background and a bunch of UFOs and motherships plotting their next move. The ""ALIEN PILOT!"" is advertised for some reason, and we also see that there is LIGHT. 211 pieces. Back of the box: A continuation. The alien is driving away in his big circular spaceship. The farmer is like ""PLEASE HELP ME"" and he's still hanging on to his pitchfork... okay... the ADU lackey is shooting blindly and running toward the UFO, saying, ""COME BACK HERE YOU NOOB"" or something along those lines. Sides of the box: boring.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Parts. I think the parts in this set are fairly standard. We get some common pieces in rare lime green, which is always nice. I especially like the trans-blue circle small dome, for lack of what they're called. :P And I know something all of you will love, we get a FLICK FIRE MISSILE! :O ISN'T THAT GREAT?</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Only three minifigures. Not too bad. The alien pilot is ugly but the head is well-designed. The farmer is a nicely-printed minifig and also well-done. The ADU lackey is standard. He has two exactly identical faces on his head. No, one of the thick gray fancy mustaches is slightly tilted... what a change. Nice printing.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's fun. I don't have much to say. It's a circular spaceship with a light brick. Really fun.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It's awesome. It's a circular giant spaceship with a light brick. Who doesn't love it? The ADU stuff is barely worth mention, but it's fine. I personally don't have anything against flick-fire missiles as long as they don't ruin the design or look of the set. This scenario is okay. But the UFO is very fun. The light brick works perfectly, and casts a scary red shadow over his next victim. The light brick is activated by the push of a lever that pushes the button on the light brick. That casts light into the hole in the big hexagon brick. The abduction feature DOES NOT automatically pick up the farmer, as shown on the box. You have to press the spaceship down on the guy for him to get stuck in there, and then his legs hang out. In the abduction feature are the rubber pieces that were first introduced in Assassin Droid Battle Pack. Does this interfere with the light brick? Why, yes, it does.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Screw long descriptions.</div><div><br></div><div>Value for money: 6.9/10. Kind of high, even if it DOES have a light brick and a flick fire missile.</div><div><br></div><div>Minifigures: 8/10 They're really well-designed.

"Firox_5000","2012-01-21T16:32:51.58Z","Undentified lego set","<p>I was given this set by a close relitive member for christmas 2011. The set contains 211 pieces and took me around 25-30 minutes to build. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this set, there are 3 figures included which are a farmer with some neat printing on the chest and torso with a pitch fork, A space defender with the loverly aqua blue uniform as well as holding a double laser gun and reversable head. The other figure is an alien with some intersting pink and silver printing on the figure and a unique molded head. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model also includes two protective barriers and a flickfire missile as well. The main part of the set however is the alien ship itself which is the second biggest in the series and quite abit bigger than it appears on the pictures. The ship is very sturdy [ apart from the antenna's], is easy to fly about and play with and is very reminisant of a alien flying saucer as well as containing some chunky and large pieces for the build as well. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The abduction set has very wide range of features such as the flickfire missile, light brick in the top of the model which shines below giving off a bright beam and also the abduction feature where a figure from below can be partly sucked on to the bottum of the ship and be flown away. These major features make the set's playability quite durable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set £25.99 can be seen rather pricey due to it's lack of parts for the price. However as alot of these parts are large and the set includes a light brick, this justifies some of the overpricing. However to achieve an outstanding rating in value, this set would require a price tag of £20.99 [or less]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend this set to anyone interested in light bricks, hardcore fans of space and classic lego, anyone who wants a fair sized flying saucer model, any one intersted in lego aliens and also for the parts which you could use for other things if alien conquest is not your thing. There is no particular reason why I would not recommend this set.</p>

"mrmightymyth","2012-04-05T11:41:38.9Z","Unexpected Cohesion","Early last year when I first found out about Alien Conquest, my inner child lit up. Finally another real deal classic sci-fi space set. All that was available of the names, ""tripod"", ""saucer"", ""mothership"". My imagination raced. I just <i>knew</i>&nbsp;they would be awesome. Finally the images were released and I was a bit underwhelmed. Maybe I had psyched myself up too much, I'm not sure. The mothership looked disappointing, perhaps too cumbersome? Anything with a built in handle, a constant reminder that this thing is going to be hellish to manipulate, is just unappealing. The tripod was perhaps my biggest let down, I had all these War of the Worlds-esque visions stalking the placid neighborhood streets in my head. The saucer, however, was a mystery to me. The old UFO set was one of my favorites and I guess I was expecting something similar to that. At first I was let down, but then, the more I studied the image, the more intriguing the design became.<div><br></div><div>Finally they were released and I went to TRU first thing that morning to pick up a couple of the sets. I grabbed the saucer first. I rushed home and opened it up, eager to see how this thing fit together. And might I say, I was quite surprised. The cohesion was remarkable. Such a beautiful, simple design. The way the LED and the ""teeth"" in the maw on the bottom work together is, exceptional. At first I wasn't all too pleased with the jutting LED mechanism sitting in the cockpit, feeling that there was a much better method of placement hidden in the design. But, really, the simplicity is too precious to mar with an expanded inner chamber. And really, the mechanism isn't unsightly in the cockpit. It actually gives it the cockpit a ""brain-like"" aesthetic. Makes it look more like a control room.</div><div><br></div><div>Once I took off my nostalgia goggles and came to terms with the fact that my favorite sets from the 90's really lack such cohesion and flush simplicity, I think I can say definitively that this is indeed my favorite set.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You get pretty nice parts in this set, 8 quarters UFO pieces, a big transparent bubble cockpit, some lime green and purple which are colors&nbsp;I hadn&#39;t&nbsp;seen in any set before, some specialised&nbsp;bricks that would be used for cars (like those things for mud above wheels), 2x8 rubber spikes and of course a red&nbsp;light brick</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>3 minifigures is a decent amount and it&#39;s interesting that they are all completely different. The farmer and soldier come with backprinting and the soldier has a double sided face (not the farmer). I got the wrong alien, the one from the tripod set which had a very nice and funny headpiece, but no backprinting. The alien emperor also has no backprinting, so I would expect the same of the alien pilot.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The last saucer I built was the 1997 cyber saucer, so it&#39;s definitely a different build. A bit flimsy at first, because of the abduction mechanism inside, but not hard to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a saucer of a decent size for 30&euro;, it is bigger than it appears on pictures, it can catch minifigs by landing on them and the light brick will cast a red crosshair so you don&#39;t miss, so it&#39;s quite fun. A small disappointment is that I also have Whitecap bay which comes with an orange light brick, and the red one&nbsp;seems to light up less intensely, the crosshair is quite hard to see unless the room is sufficiently dark.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I rate price a 4 for 30&euro;. Got mine for 12&euro;, so can&#39;t really complain. If you like alien stuff, I think it would be a good one to get. I actually got both this and the alien mothership (for an even better bargain) and I think, if you except the fact that Alien mothership has quite an outstanding selection of parts,&nbsp;UFO abduction is the best of the 2.</p>
