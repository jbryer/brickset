"ETAV8R","2011-05-06T18:56:42.697Z","Amazing!","<p>From the initial pictures and videos posted on the web I knew I would have this set. The whole theme of Alien Conquest interests me. I wasn't an AFOL during the Agents theme. I would like to have the Agents command truck but will not be shelling out the dough for it. <br></p><br><p>I went to the local SoCal Lego store to see what was new on the shelves after reading that the AC and POTC sets were being released. The store had them all. After talking with a sales associate I decided to only get four of S4 minifigs. I just didn't want to shell out the money for what I wanted. After I went home all I could think about was the Earth Defense HQ. Had to have it!</p><br><p>Went back to the store and picked it up and also the 7049 Alien Striker set so I would have more AC minifigs for the set. <br></p><br><p>The set is amazing. Even without any improvements I can see how a child would spend hours playing with it. There is a lot of room for minifigs in various areas in the set. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Forward Section:</p><p>The cab for the front of the rig does not have seats. As it comes I am sure 3-4 ADU personell could go there. With some seats inside it does get cramped so you have more room going without. The instructions have you place the steering wheel on the right side. Easy change for us on the west side of the pond. If the caputured alien escapes he does so through the cab since there is no barrier like the windows separating the scientist in the rear portion. On the top the lights do not swivel but this too is an easy change. The flickfire missle station on top turns but does not tilt upward. Again easy fix for this. <br></p><br><p>Rear Section:</p><p>There is a ramp for the little buggy and stretcher. It backs in so any potential person or alien can be immediately scanned by the scanner inside. There are two cubbies on each side, one with a door and the other with two drawers. Near the fold out radar dishes there are holders, one for two syringes and the other for a walkie-talkie. I also placed a weapon there just in case. The improvement I did here was to to put turntables under the radar dishes so they can turn instead of only pointing forward. The scientist in the forward section can spin backwards and access a computer for the rear scanner. The scientist also has printed computer blocks with what looks to be an alien. Very cool!</p><p>The jet launch section on top was a bit tricky to figure out during the build but working with it solved my dilemma. The jet itself is very neat too. Slides off the launcher easily. With my tilt improvement to the front rocket launcher the jet snaps off the antenna when launching in various directions. I'll live with it. <br></p><br>Minifigs:<br><p>The figures are all great. As with the eurobricks review I made certain to have the older figure in a command position in the cab and the female as the pilot in the jet. With my extra figure in the turret ready for any UFO attack. <br></p><br>Jet/UFO:<br>This set has it all with the inclusion of a UFO and to catch or defend against it, a jet. The jet is very neat and I would like to figure out a way to fold the wings. The UFO has awesome simplicity. The clear dome is great. It has enough room for loose storage of the alien blaster. <br><br><p>I don't usually like to place stickers on the sets I build. This set changed that. The UFO has to have the stickers to look real. I think instead of paper decals LEGO could go with those vinyl/plastic decals which would have better longetivity and still save them money from printing on the bricks. The box seems the same size as any other set of this size. On the back of the box there is a graphic of the number 51 on the ground. This references Area 51 for any UFO/Alien fans. <br></p><br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: Design and build<br></li><li>Pro 2: Figures</li><li>Pro 3: Playability<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Price of course, could be a bit lower. $90 USD for 879 pieces. <br></li><li>Con 2: Stickers</li></ul><br>Overall this set is great with awesome playability. I wish I was 8 years old again. The color brings back memories of the orginal Space series when I was 8 years old. Only a couple changes from the original design. I think they could have included one more ADU figure in the set and/or a civilian other than the scientist. Not sure where I will put my S4 hazmat guys but they will have some role here. If you can hold out for a future BOGO sale you're better than me. I do know some people who will get this as a gift after the next BOGO sale to include the AC theme. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"dragon_teenager","2011-10-12T11:55:47.19Z","A modern classic. ","I picked up this lovely set marked down 30% on Amazon.com, and now having received and built it, I realize that I would have happily paid full price for it. This set is simply wonderful - it packs a healthy dose of old-school charm with some great construction techniques, a variety of exclusive parts and an extremely play-friendly overall package. <br><br>I wasn't always such a fan of this set - it seemed pretty over-hyped by the LEGO Space community (the owner of this site called it the best retail set of the year!) and I couldn't really justify spending my hard-earned $89.99 on such a boxy looking vehicle. But my hesitancy was quickly eased once I started constructing it - there's a lot more to this set than you might think. <br><br>The first thing out of the box that you build are the minifigures, which are great. It comes with two exclusive figs, including a scientist and alien cyborg. Both of these are great - the scientist has very detailed printing (including back printing) and the alien is extremely unique. His head is three parts! You also get a generic alien ""grunt"", an alien clinger, and two ADU soldiers. The two soldiers sport slightly different prints - the woman has an orange harness, and I'm pretty sure she's supposed to be a pilot. (The Jet-Copter Encounter pilot has the same printing). The other trooper is generic, excepting a ""mustached commander"" head. I'm not sure if this is unique to this set, but I don't think it is.<br><br>Although the exclusive figs are great, I feel that LEGO was a little sparse in it's minifigure assortment with this set. Only two ADU troopers to man the entire HQ? This is probably the set's only real disappointment. <br><br>Next up is the assortment of small vehicles. The first thing you'll build is the small UFO fighter. Although it's probably the least remarkable part of the set, it's still attractively simplistic in its design, and the build is solid (a theme that pervades throughout the rest of the HQ). Plus, it includes a great trans-clear dome. You'll also build a small cart with a stretcher on it - nothing special, but it's a nice addition. <br><br>The space plane, however, is fantastic. It's very elegant in its aesthetics - its sleek, smooth, and sturdy. The build is especially enjoyable. I know a lot of people want the HQ only for the excellent space plane, and I can see why. However, the HQ is even better. <br><br>The first thing you'll notice about the HQ, once constructed, is that it is extremely compact. The walls are sturdy, the interior is detailed with cabinets and medical equipment, and the exterior is surprisingly small. Don't let this throw you off, though - the smaller size is just the result of some admirably solid construction. The HQ is bulky and it feels more like a tank than a truck. There are multiple rooms inside the HQ, including an examination bay where the scientist can observe captured alien specimens from behind a window. It's rather amazing that LEGO managed to make the interior of the vehicle feel so complete while the exterior seems relatively small. <br><br>When I say the HQ is small, I really only mean that its small compared to the box. The vehicle is still huge - roughly the same length as the Galactic Enforcer and far more complete looking. The trailer of the vehicle can detach to function as more of an outpost, and both the space plane launcher and missile boxes can detach to function as independent turrets. This really makes the set feel more like a transforming base. <br><br>There are at least two brand-new exclusive parts included with the set, including 2 medical syringes and a new printed control panel (!). Both of these are quite handy, although I don't know if I could bring myself to break this lovely set in order to use them! <br><br>This set does include stickers, and personally, I recommend that you bite the bullet and apply them. They are intelligently placed and definitely lend the set some personality (especially the UFO, which looks incredibly bland without the stickers). Most people will probably be glad to hear that the stickers are relatively sparse for a set this size.<br><br><br>Overall, this set is an instant classic, and will probably be remember by Space fans for years to come. Even if you're not a fan of the Alien Conquest theme, this particular set definitely deserves your attention. There are very few, if any, flaws to be seen here. I can't recommend 7066 highly enough! <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"kelano28","2011-08-16T11:55:47.787Z","Sci-fi Lovers, Rejoice!","<p>First I'd like to get my bias out of the way. &nbsp;When I first saw pictures of this set from Toyfair, I immediately fell in love. &nbsp;The HQ had such a rugged and functional look to it, while maintaining something of a classic space look (thanks largely to the colors). &nbsp;The first set that immediately came to mind in terms of comparison was the <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=8635-1"">8635 Mobile Command Center</a> from the Agents line. &nbsp;Sure, the themes are very different, but both sets involve a large HQ vehicle with lots of play functions and sub-vehicles. &nbsp;Combine all of this with the fact that the Mobile Command Center is one of my favorite sets, and I just had to pick this one up.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box does a good job of highlighting most of the play features of this set, understandably leaving out a couple since this thing is PACKED with them. &nbsp;Unfortunately the instructions were not packed in a separate sleeve with cardboard (as Lego has started to do again), and were fairly bent up when I opened the box.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's lots of great parts here. &nbsp;One part that is abundant that I had never seen before was a 1x2 plate that looks like it has a cheese slope attached to one side. &nbsp;This is also windscreen heaven, as you get 2 cool smoke windscreens from the jet / HQ cockpits, a blue elliptical canopy from the medical pod, and a clear bubble canopy from the UFO. &nbsp;You also clearly get a lot of nice classic space parts, including 90 degree brackets, the long laser pieces, and a sea of blue! &nbsp;Even the extra parts are flowing in this set, as I had 2 extra laser pieces (1 trans orange from the jet, 1 gray from the HQ) amongst many other cheese slopes, studs, and 1x1 plates.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Not quite as stellar as the rest of the set, but still a nice offering here. &nbsp;We only get 2 ADU soldiers: 1 standard one that appears to be an older man, and 1 woman with special printing (I'd call her a special or 'shock' trooper). &nbsp;We also get a nice scientist minifig to round out the human side.</p><p>The ""Alien Invader Pirate"", in all honesty, doesn't do much for me. &nbsp;To me it looks really busy, especially the headpiece, and the lime fang for an arm just doesn't fit with the tech arm slot he has. &nbsp;That being said, the way in which we construct the head is really cool, as it involves a trans green minifig head between two sections. &nbsp;He's not bad, but he's no <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/?m=agt014"">Spyclops</a>. &nbsp;The other alien, called the ""Alien Invader Trooper"", to me is much easier on the eyes and is far more personable. &nbsp;The head-crab-like ""Alien Clinger"" is pure fun. &nbsp;When I first saw it months back in photos I thought ""kinda pointless"", but when I realized it can cling to a minifig head the sci-fi geek in me was ecstatic. &nbsp;The function works great, and any minifig looks like they're in real trouble once you slap this sucker on.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Awesome. &nbsp;First you build the minifigs and the transport vehicle and medical pod. &nbsp;The transport vehicle is rather small, but there is a reason for this. &nbsp;Once complete, the vehicle can just back right into the HQ, putting whoever (or whatever!) is on the stretcher under the giant ""science beam"" in the medical bay. &nbsp;The medical pod is well designed and smooth (was not a fan of the mars mission 'pods'). &nbsp;</p><p>Next you build the UFO. &nbsp;Usually in sets like this the alien craft is something of a throwaway. &nbsp;While this isn't a very big UFO, it certainly is not a throwaway model. &nbsp;It has some nice purple parts and trans green galore, along with that nice windscreen. &nbsp;</p><p>Next comes the Jet. &nbsp;Another nice build, and it turns out to be more sizable than I had anticipated. &nbsp;The lasers on the inside of the wings is a really nice touch and a technique we don't see very often from Lego.</p><p>And finally you build the giant HQ. &nbsp;Both 'sections' are a blast to build, and have such a nice 'clean' look to them. &nbsp;The technique used for connecting the two sections is simple but very effective at 'locking' and 'unlocking'.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This thing is built for play and looks great. &nbsp;There are several opening and moving parts, including the front cockpit, front area for the medical pod, rear laser panels, rear hatch, and several others. &nbsp;The turrets in the front look AWESOME, and best of all fire very well (so well that you have to feel bad for the little UFO). &nbsp;The rear launch pad for the Jet is effective, but for what it does I think it was a little over-designed. &nbsp;I think they could've accomplished something simliar with less Technic, but at this point I'm simply nit-picking. &nbsp;Both of these sections on top come off to allow easy access, and rightfully so, as the inside of the HQ is just as decked out with computer screens and windows. &nbsp;I haven't seen these exact tires before, and they work great on carpet, nice and big.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>As I have mentioned in every single section above, this set is phenomenal. &nbsp;You get looks, functionality, and a retro feel that only a space vehicle made of blue/gray/yellow could provide. &nbsp;I had very high hopes for this set, yet is somehow managed to surpass them. &nbsp;My only real qualms would be that the Pirate Alien is a little busy, and that the aliens are quite outgunned in this set. &nbsp;The latter is forgivable, however, as this is the <i>Earth</i> Defense HQ. &nbsp;I would say this set is every bit as good as the Mobile Command Center, and the fact that it is sci-fi gives it ever the slightest edge in my book.</div><div><br></div><div>To those of you who are on the fence with this one, I hope I have convinced you to pick this up, as it really is incredible. &nbsp;If you even remotely think this one is up your alley, chances are it will be just that.</div><div><br></div><div>Happy Building! &nbsp;I'm off to get some much needed reinforcements for the aliens..</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"SgtSmash","2011-06-20T17:41:15.297Z","One of the coolest sets ever!","<p>The ""Alien Conquest"" theme is like a mixture of the ""Alien"" movies and ""Men In Black"".&nbsp;And while it's considered a subtheme of the Space line, I feel that these sets have more in common with the City theme. Especially if&nbsp;you have an existing town full of people, it makes for a ton of fun play possibilities. When the City police, fire and rescue cannot control the situation, here comes the ADU! Your ""First, Last, and Only line of Defense"". And if you notice carefully on the stickers, the folks at Lego spelled it as ""DEFENCE"".&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I bought the Earth Defense HQ after seeing it on the shelf, and having my choice of picking any other City set,&nbsp;I couldn't help but think this would offer a lot more play value for me and my daughter. She loved the Alien Tri-Pod and had a blast with the Alien Clinger character, attaching it to various townfolk. This set basically comes with everything you need to help the townpeople rid themselves of the alien parasites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truck is reminscent of the massive truck/semi in ""Universal Soldier"". When this thing comes pulling up, you know that the proverbial doo-doo has hit the fan. Lego did an awesome job with the colors that went into the design, and that of the alien craft. As I put it together, I couldn't help but wish that it was available back when I was a kid. The build of the truck, plane and UFO kept me occupied for a couple of hours. The rear section of the truck with the Alien scanner is really cool. I like the computers/containment windows, and the syringes they included to either knock out the infected people so Alien removal can take place, or knock out the Alien...up to you. The play possibilites go on and on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The characters are OK, nothing too fancy. The old man ADU agent also comes with the #7052 ""UFO Abduction"" set. Having purchased that set as well, I wish they had included a different character, and not reuse the same ones over and over,&nbsp;but I digress. You get two alien bad guys, a&nbsp;Clinger, the two ADU agents, and a wacky looking mad scientist reminscient of Dr. Okun from the movie ""Independence Day""&nbsp;(""Hey. Hey. You wanna see 'em?""). I&nbsp;wish for the higher price of this set that they&nbsp;would have included&nbsp;at least 1-2 townpeople. Some of the&nbsp;other&nbsp;Alien Conquest sets&nbsp;included at least one helpless sap being attacked by the Aliens.&nbsp;Having at least one person needing rescuing right out of the box would have been nice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The jet is really cool, as well as the multiple cannons on top of the vehicle. It&nbsp;gives the set a futuristic feel, and provides a way to scare off/shoot down the alien invaders. Police cars and fire trucks aren't too much of a threat. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are going to collect any of the Alien Conquest sets, this one is a must-have.&nbsp;Even if you are going to buy just one&nbsp;Alien Conquest set, this one includes everything you need to have a little extra-terrestrial mayhem. &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"brickscape","2011-12-13T13:18:53.48Z","My favorite set of all time","<p>I drooled over pics of this set for some time before finally deciding to cough up the cash to buy it. While it is one of the most expensive sets I've ever purchased, it was well worth it and it has become my favorite Lego set of all time.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h4><FONT color=#000000></FONT>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>My only complaint about this set is the number of minifigures (which seems to be par for the course in the Alien Conquest theme). I do wish they had included a civilian or at least another ADU trooper. That being said, there are some nice figs in the set. </p>
<p>The male ADU trooper is the same figure as the one in the UFO Abduction set (#7052) but you can always swap the head if you don't want identical looking troopers. The female ADU trooper is unique to this set and is wearing the pilot version of the ADU jumpsuit. </p>
<p>The Toxic Cleanup Scientist is a great looking and distinctive figure that is also unique to this set. His torso is decorated on the front and back and he also has decorated legs. His white suit is a nice departure from the dark azure of the rest of the ADU figures. If you add a white space helmet (like the one from the astronaut figure in the first series of the collectible minifigures) the scientist can join the troopers in more dangerous settings. The one negative point about this figure is that his head is only printed on one side unlike the rest of the human figures in this series.</p>
<p>You get two aliens and a little clinger in the set as well. One is a standard Alien Trooper available in many of the AC sets. The other is the set exclusive Alien Android. The Android shares the same head mold as the Commander from the Alien Mothership set (#7065) but has different printed detail. He has a robotic arm and leg on the right side of his body. This prevents him from holding anything with his right arm (unless you swap the little tentacle for a claw) and also makes it impossible to seat him securely as the peg leg isn't useful in a sitting position. He is a very neat little figure that looks very different from the others in the series. <br/></p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The set contains several vehicles which made for an interesting build. It took about 2 hours in all and I really had fun making everything. There are stickers in this set and those on the curved pieces could be tricky to place especially if you want the stickers on the UFO to be relatively even with each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>When everything is built you end up with, in my opinion, one of the most jam-packed and interesting Lego sets ever. The main truck is composed of two parts and the variable connection means the two can be tightly connected giving the appearance of one large vehicle, more loosely connected like a truck pulling a trailer, or completely separated. The whole thing rolls along on 10 big rubber tires and it looks very rugged and impressive.</p>
<p>There's quite a bit going on in the front half of the truck. The main cabin seats two and the roof is hinged to allow easy access. I find the hinge system on this and everything else in the set to be quite secure. Further back there is a pair of doors (one on each side) which are hinged at the bottom and serve as ramps when they are fully opened. There's plenty of space inside this area for more troops or the alien containment pod. At the rear is a little computer lab with computer terminals and a chair on a swivel. The lab is separated from the rest of the vehicle by a wall containing some large windows. </p>
<p>On the outside of the front half of the truck you have rotatable sets of headlights, ball and socket mounted guns, large spotlights on the roof and a large missile launcher. The eight missiles are grouped in two pods of four and can be launched&nbsp;four at a time with a plunger type system that works pretty well. There is a seat between the pods for a minifigure. The launcher system can rotate but it does not elevate. The section of roof that the missile launcher is mounted on is easily removed for access to the computer lab.</p>
<p>The back half of the vehicle is dedicated to a nifty little medical lab. The rear of the vehicle is a fold-down ramp that allows access for minifigs as well as the included little support vehicle and trailer. This simple little vehicle is a neat addition to the set and the trailer can be fitted with either the alien containment pod or a stretcher. With the stretcher in place, the vehicle can back into the med lab and put the victim (or alien) on the stretcher right underneath the scanning machine (which looks similar to an MRI machine). In this position, the vehicle also fits perfectly inside allowing the ramp to close up again. I think the Haz-Mat collectible minifig makes a great driver for this little vehicle. Inside the lab there are clips for tools (like syringes or a walkie-talkie) or guns. There is also a cabinet (with a laptop computer stowed inside) and a pair of drawers for holding more tools. There are panels on each side of the vehicle which flip down and allow little scanning dishes to be deployed. These scanning dishes are the only really unstable part of the entire set as they pop off almost every time I try to deploy them. </p>
<p>The launching rack for the Interceptor shuttle is mounted to the roof of the med lab. This section of roof is also easily removed. The launching rack is a rather complicated build using lots of Technic elements and can rotate and elevate. The Interceptor shuttle itself is a great, solid starfighter with lots of laser guns and a hinged canopy.</p>
<p>In addition to the main truck, little support vehicle and Interceptor shuttle, you also get a small alien UFO. While it's nothing spectacular and it's vastly outgunned, the UFO is a solid build and a nice addition to the alien armada. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>There is just so much going on with this set that I'm still awed by it even now, months after I bought and built it. There's so much playability that it's really a playset as much as it is a vehicle. You get a lot with this set and there is also a lot you could add or customize if you're interested. I'd definitely recommend this set at full MSRP and say it's an absolute can't miss if you see it on sale.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Faefrost","2014-07-28T05:28:48.65Z","An often overlooked gem of a Space Set","<p>What a great set. Possibly the best ground vehicle Lego has ever released in their Space line. Just so much to do while still looking so so good. Classic Space fans will love it as its the best collection of classic blue parts to be released in forever. Kids with love it because it is packed with m ore detail and more play features per brick than virtually any other Space set. Perhaps the only one to challenge it in this regard is the new Benny&#39;s ssS LL929 ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Older fans will get a distinctly &quot;Gerry Anderson&quot; feel from this set. You can almost hear the themes to UFO, Space 1999 and Captain Scarlet as you play with it. The main set is a large articulated 10 wheeled truck. A wonderful &quot;Vic Viper&quot; Space fighter.&nbsp;A small utility buggy and medical trailer. an alien capture pod and a very nice smaller alien saucer. Probably my absolute favorite of the alien ships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figs are great they include the Earth Defense Sargeant (old grizzled mustached guy), a female fighter pilot, and Earth Defense Scientist, an Alien Trooper and an Alien Cyborg Commander. Oh and lets not forget the alien head sucker brain slug thingy. The Scientist, Female Pilot and Cyborg are unique to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lead portion of the truck is heavily armed with lasers, canons and 2 quad rocket launchers. The cockpit is a dream seating 2 figs side by side. Behind the cockpit you have the compartment for the alien containment pod with fold out ramps on both sides so you can drive it in and out with the buggy. Behind that is a glass partition to the scientists control area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mechanism connecting the cab and trailer is brilliant. It can be easily locked between separated vehicles, an articulated cab and trailer mode or locked together as a single solid long multi axle vehicle.</p>

<p>The front of the trailer is a medical bay with a detailed very good looking medical scanner. Behind it is equipment storage and crew areas. The rear of the trailer has a large ramp that allows the buggy and trailer to drive right inside and remain there. Atop the rear is the rather substantial space fighter on a turntable launch rail. Turn the knob and it elevates to launch position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The space fighter itself is a work of art. It is a not so subtle homage to AFOLs and the Lego fan community. An honest to god official Lego Vic Viper design. Wonderfully realized. The fighter alone is on par with many of the smaller Star Wars sets. It is that good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Play features are just to numerous to mention. the set simply does not stop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set was designed by Mark Stafford, one of Lego&#39;s more recognizable modern&nbsp;designers with a flair for Space and Robots and Mecha. This set is one of his best works. Nothing about this set is bad. Nothing about it has any negatives. It is as close to perfection in Lego form as we are prone to get. The only minor quibble. It could have used 1 more minifig. And you will probably want at least one of the Alien Conquest Battle Packs to fully populate it.</p>

That is sad. It&#39;s got Classic Space written all over it which I love. But on to my substantive review.</p>

<p>The Building experience -&nbsp; There are some fun mechanisms in this build. There is a nice variation on the flick fire missile. In this case, in air defence battery form. The launcher for the fighter also is fun, raising the the launch angle in a way that harks back to the old Alpha Base and the Intergalactic Command Base. There are numerous flip open door ways and hatchs, some just allow entry and exit. Others flip out&nbsp;search lights / radar dishes.</p>

<p>Parts - Lots of blocky styles and small portals. The parts are very similar to the the blue, yellow and grey bricks available. There are few detail parts. I would love to have yellow transparency parts. I love the big chunky wheels.</p>

<p>Playability - Muchly!!!!!! You have a medium sized and very swooshable fightercraft on the roof. A buggy to transport a sick soldier infect by the head alien. An alien containment capsule. Scientist with a lab possibly for dissecting the alien. The forward truck has two guns on and can separate from the rear two thirds of the vehicle or just extend and articulate. The little UFO is fun. It&#39;s a nice sized little fighter and tangles nicely with the Alien Defence Unit Fighter. The buggy, lab and alien containment capsule mixed with the UFO gives bags of fun. Perhaps the little green head alien takes over a soldier by mind control or maybe the UFO crashes and the ADU turn up to capture and experiment on them. It&#39;s great. In addition, if you have Lego City sets, the ADU can be brought in to fight off an Alien invasion! This set makes a great mobile base for the ADU and would look amazing trundling through open fields to find a downed UFO or racing through a city to fend of an alien invasion. Perhaps the ADU are the&nbsp;baddies and have brought marshal law to a city that didn&#39;t need it for their own conspiratal purposes.</p>

<p>Value for money. This set came out in my own Lego Dark Age. Consequently I only acquired one a couple of years back. I would love to see what lego had planned for the 2nd wave if sales had worked out. As it is, I think this set is great value and has hours of potential. Every city should have an ADU.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I love this set, so should other AFOLs&nbsp;who remember classic space and any budding neo-classic space builder should too just for the parts.</p>
