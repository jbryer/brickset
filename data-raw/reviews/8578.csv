"PluffTed","2011-05-07T21:45:12.41Z","Move over Space Police!","<p>Got this set in the mail after ordering it from Toys R Us.com.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it had stickers.&nbsp; Had some very cool parts and even had maybe 5 new ones.&nbsp; The 2 alien ships are UNBEATABLE, as they can combine into one ship by folding up one side on each ship and they connect since there are 2 axle pieces on one of the ships.&nbsp; The aliens were somewhat boring, since they were the same as the other Alien Conquest alien minifigs.&nbsp; The Jet-Copter: ALSO UNBEATABLE.&nbsp; The jet-copter features a prison pod that connects to the back of the ship quick nicely and can hold 1 alien.&nbsp; Also a nice feature is a dual-firing missile button that can simply be pushed to fire&nbsp;2 flick-launch style missiles.&nbsp; Not an official feature, but you can also adjust the jet engines on the bottom by moving them up or down.&nbsp; This jet-copter is&nbsp;freaking LOADED with guns.&nbsp; It has 2 dual lasers on each end of the wings, 2 long orange antena-like lasers, 2 guns (that usually come with alien conquest ADU Agent minifigs) with binocular pieces on the ends, and if you want to count them: the 4 launchable missiles.&nbsp; Very highly recommend this set to any Lego fan!</p>

"omgbrick","2011-06-30T21:32:10.427Z","Air Support Inbound!","<p><br/><strong>Introduction<br/></strong>Alien Conquest is one of my favorite space themes to be released, whether it's from the retrofied alien invaders, to the allure of the humanâ€™s military vehicles I was in love with the theme once I saw the first non-blurry pictures. <br/>The theme carries on Lego Space's tradition of pitting humans against aliens. As such we get an element from both factions in almost every set. This holds true for the ""Jet-Copter Encounter"" as it gives us two interlocking alien space craft, along with the main feature of the set, the heavily armed Jet-Copter.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Opening the Box<br/></strong>Upon opening the box you'll find bags numbered 1-3 plus one unnumbered bag containing several large pieces. The first bag includes the minifigures, and the twin alien craft. The second creates the base of the jet copter, with the third finishing the gunship. There is also one instruction booklet, and two sticker sheets one for the aliens one for the ADU.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Minfigs</strong></p>
<p>The set includes three minifigures; a human pilot, and two alien pilots. The aliens are identical to any other alien pilots you'll find in the series, and both include a laser pistol. The human features a torso that can only be found in this set and ""Earth-Defense HQ"". While his helmet is just like any other ADU soldier's, the&nbsp;left leg is printed with a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;depicted a UFO. He has a double sided head one side smiling the other more confused/worried looking. One&nbsp;thing&nbsp;to note however, is that he doesn't come with an extra laser rifle as depicted on the top of the box. In total there are two of the new laser rifles in this set and both are used on the nose of the gunship.<br/></p>
<p><strong>The Build<br/></strong>The Build took me about an hour to complete; it's fairly straight forward with minimal use of technic. It does&nbsp;include some rather large parts such as the&nbsp;City airplane tails being used as wings. <br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>The Alien Craft<br/></strong>The alien craft are identical save for the two technic pins used to connect the two craft together. They both have stickers on their ""wings"", and are simple to construct. The wings can fold up to allow for combining them. But one flaw I did find; is that there is no where to store their pistols. The pilots have to hold their pistol with one hand, and fly with the other. Speaking of flying there are no control pads in the saucers, only a light transparent blue 1 by 4 tile in front and one behind the pilot. They may not be an outstanding design, but they do get the job done. In fact due to the simple inter-connecting design/feature you could easily combine more than two of these alien ships to make an even bigger and deadlier design.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>The Jet-Copter<br/></strong>Now we come to the main attraction of the set... the jet copter. It's quite a nice design if I do say so myself, it looks very futuristic and is one of the more interesting designs Lego has produced lately. It has both a four bladed rotor, and two jet engines for propulsion. The Jet engines are on hinged plates so that they can be adjusted. They act as landing gear, but during flight can also be folded closer to the body for a more aerodynamic appearance. The cockpit is very roomy and has both a control pad and a joystick for controls. The use of the new laser rifles on the front of the craft is nice especially since they added binoculars to the rifles to create even bigger guns. I believe that the cockpit widow a new piece and it looks great, but for some reason the Lego designer opted to only connect it via one stud so that it does fall off quite easily.<br/>Right behind the main body is a little pod to put a captured alien in for future dissection. It uses a light blue Atlantis windshield, but it looks&nbsp;odd since the top and sides of it are rounded while there a regular 4 by 8 plate used as&nbsp;a base. Because of this the pod lacks a nice flowing design. The tail looks great if a bit fragile, and the two little wings have been designed expertly. There is a little knob behind each that when pressed will launch&nbsp;the two flick fires&nbsp;&nbsp;mounted on each wing. I do recommend adding the stickers to the Jet-Copter as they do add some extra flavor. As a whole the model is pretty strong and swooshable.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;<br/><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Over all the Jet Copter is an excellent set. It has a decent price, lots of playability, good parts, and most importantly it just looks plain awesome. I defiantly recommend this set if you're intro space, military, aircraft, or anything in between. <br/>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Bram","2012-02-04T06:08:17.087Z","ADU's deadliest airborne fighter","Since there are many detailed reviews of this set, I'll just give my brief opinion.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall design</span><br>1. Jetcopter : Apparently this is an understatement. The helo is more like an army helicopter gunship. Everywhere you look, there are guns, more guns, complimented by quad missiles. The overall design takes its cue from the US Army AH-64 Apache no doubt about it. The boxy flat faced exterior is there for low radar signature. Coincidently, the squared nature of the Lego bricks really emphasizes the 'stealthiness' of this jetcopter. Just look at modern US jetfighter, you'll know what I mean. So it's not from the 80's..but it's there for a purpose.&nbsp; The ADU sets in the AC theme is some of the most military like set ever to come from Lego. The whole aircraft is very intimadating from the front, and it's all business. The jetcopter has a retractable landing gears which also serve as the engine. They can be tucked for a more streamlined look during flight and extended for landing. The capture pod is a nice addition, but can easily modified to store heavy ordnance, such as bombs. So this is a multi purpose helicopter. The stickers are actually very neat with digital camouflage.<br><br>2. Alien ship: the alien ship can be separated into two ships. Which is very neat. Unlike some set which offers this as a mere 'accessory', the alien ship is very well designed. You can even attach more than just two ships side by side if you have another set.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Playability/MOC mods</span><br>Very high. You get one intimidating helicopter swarmed by a couple of alien ships. The capture pod can be used for rescue or capture missions. You can swap the capture pods and guns with your own MOC ordnance such as bombs, missiles and add more guns!<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifig</span><br>One ADU pilot, with a nice harness prints on the front and rear of the torso. The smirk on the pilot's dual printed head reminds me of those cocky ace pilots in Top Gun movies. The two aliens are the same Alien Pilot you'll get from other sets.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Verdict</span><br>KFOL/TFOL : So mom didn't buy you the 7066 Mobile HQ..but she might just buy you the 7067 which is a remarkable set of its own. You'll have countless hours of fun with this set.<br><br>AFOL : Just be warned, this set is highly swooshable, you might find yourself recreating helicopter blade slaps with your mouth when holding it..and your wife is there watching you and thinking ""what kind of freak did I marry?"" LOL...<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall: 9.5/10. Get it!</span><br><br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"xccj","2011-08-12T05:20:04.513Z","Love The Alien Ships","<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">This is a $40 set, but I got it on sale at BrickFair so the price was manageable, and it's more affordable than some of the other larger sets.&nbsp; The main reason I picked this up was because it had decent vehicles for both sides: the small ships for the aliens and the Jet Copter for the humans.&nbsp; This makes it feel like both sides are on more equal terms compared to other sets released in the AC Theme.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">The Jet-Copter is the primary focus of this set, and it takes up most of the pieces in the set.&nbsp; It's mostly blue and dark bley in color, with some hints of yellow and trans orange added in.&nbsp; And the thing is massive: about 10 inches wide and 12 inches long, give or take.&nbsp; Unfortunately, for what it has in width and length, it lacks in height.&nbsp; It feels like the Copter has been squashed.&nbsp; (Maybe one of the alien UFOs landed on it before takeoff?)&nbsp; On the other hand, it's supposed to be a Jet-Copter, so perhaps it isn't as tall for aerodynamic reasons.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">There are a few pros and cons for the Copter.&nbsp; First of all, it has&nbsp;two new duel flick missile launchers.&nbsp; This design works much better than the traditional flick missiles that have been used in so many other sets, although you still can't get much distance with them.&nbsp; The stickers, if you add them, have lots of nice detail to them, and really add to what would've been a blank area on the Copter.&nbsp; Also, there is a connection area for a containment pod in the back of the Copter, for transporting the mysterious alien figs.&nbsp; When the pod is connected in, it looks nice, but without it, the Copter does look a bit empty in the back.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">As far as cons go, I found that the landing gear isn't great for holding the Copter up while on display; it will work, but the design could have been better.&nbsp; Additionally, the slopes on the tail tend to fall off, and it makes me wonder why Lego didn't go for a sturdier design.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">However, the real gems of this set are the two alien ships.&nbsp; They're much smaller than the Copter, but the designs utilize the pieces very well.&nbsp; There are two identical ships that have arch-like pieces on hinges.&nbsp; When down, this gives the ships a circular feel.&nbsp; But the arch pieces can be positioned up and allow the two ships to connect and form a larger ship to take on the Jet Copter.&nbsp; This is just such a cool feature, and I find myself playing with these two ships much more than with the Copter.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">Unfortunately, the alien ships aren't without some design flaws.&nbsp; For whatever reason, the alien pilot's head keeps hitting the edge of his cockpit, making it difficult to get the alien into a secure sitting position.&nbsp; It works fine for the other alien drone, but not for the pilotâ€™s head mold, which is a shame.&nbsp; Also, while the windscreens work, I wish they had added something a little more substantial.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">Overall, I think this is one of the better sets you can get from Alien Conquest.&nbsp; It gives you solid vehicles for both the aliens and the humans, so you can instantly take the battles to the sky.&nbsp; The Jet-Copter has an interesting design, but I love the way that the two alien ships can combine into one.&nbsp; If you want one really good AC set, then this is one to grab.&nbsp; If you're looking to buy all the sets... well, then this was on your list already.&nbsp; And now you can decide the outcome of the invasion; do the aliens prevail, or is the human defense enough to stop the invaders.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4

"Itellyounothing","2019-08-29T19:55:43.04Z","Swing and a Miss! But I do love the parts.","<p>I like this set sooooooo much I bought two of them and still only rate it two.</p>

<p>Why you ask? Read on and see.</p>

<p>Building experience -&nbsp; The major joy here was nostalgia. Building this was like revisiting the 80s. The ADU sets are very much neo-classic space. The build was unchallenging but pleasurable.Limited simple techniques mostly wiht a few funky connections.</p>

<p>Parts - Now this is where I really love this set and why I got two. The parts added to my already considerable stash have let me build two visions of what I think the set should really be. After building the helicopt and realising it just wasn&#39;t what I wanted, I created a rocket ship to carry two crew&nbsp;and the alien containment capsule and an interceptor again, capable of carrying an alien containment capsule but only equipped with one crewman. I am deeply proud of both anc couldn&#39;t have built either without the infusion of bits......</p>

<p>Playability - Hmm! I am of two minds. Any alien ship that small capable of zipping about should make mincemeat of a mere &quot;jetcopter&quot;. Airwolf it ain&#39;t. But this is lego. So&nbsp;imagination rules. One ADU soldier has to shoot down two alien mini-UFOs that can split or join to make his life hard. He has two wicked looking guns to do it, four flick fire missiles with a novel launcher mechanism, four static guns on the wing tips and a transport capsule for one alien. You can imagine, he surprises a flyer form behind a hill or tall building apache gunship-like, guns and missile fire until one mini-UFO is spashed and the other forced to crash land, then he stalks the wounded pilot through forest or city until eventually cornering his foe and bringing them back to the ADu for interrogation or examination / dissection. Brutal, fun simple. It&#39;s a nice weight, the helicopter is thus swooshable.</p>

<p>Value for money, yeah why not. Particularly second hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall - I think the Jetcopter is in the wrong theme. Helicopters can&#39;t chase UFOs and intercept them. Fast rocket / jet fighters can, something more like a Bell X15 would have been better. This might have worked better as a troop carring chopper or just got for superfast rocket interceptor. I love helicopters in other themes. The Ultra Agents Helicopter is sweet!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can only give it a three, for nostaglia and&nbsp;for parts. For more flexible minds, there is clearly many playability options.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
