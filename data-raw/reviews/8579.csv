"kbsig106","2011-05-04T13:54:04.023Z","This set has great value and can go Neo/Classical w/ the black panels from the siege tower","<p>This is my first review, please bear with me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ordered this set with the BOGO50% off at TRU recently&nbsp;and was received last week for a weekend build. Total build time took about 20 minutes and the four minifigures that come with the set fit right in to the Kingdom's series. The green base plates are&nbsp;ok but I replaced the middle 2 x plate with a larger green plate for stability at the gate and a place for the minifigures to stand.&nbsp;Another modification was adding the black classic castle panels from the 1984 siege tower set to give this Dragon's Prison a full complete look.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 Kingdoms Minifigures 
<li>Great value at $19.99 
<li>Brown bricks! 
<li>Armored horse 
<li>Spear cart 
<li></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Green base plates need to be a little wider for stability</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was my first purchase of the new Kingdoms release and was not disappointed with the set. The set will fit in with both recent and classical releases - as well as additional&nbsp;potental with modifcations and additions.</p>

"The_Guy_With_The_Bricks","2011-05-30T17:42:03.527Z","A Great Addition to the Dragon Knights' Kingdom- Which Includes the Baddest Lego Castle Minifig Ever!","Great progress has been seen recently in the Lego Castle genre, particularly with the wave of recent Kingdoms sets, including the new 7187 Escape from the Dragon's Prison. This little set hits the $19.99 USD price point just right, and matches the look and feel of previous ""Dragon Knight"" sets. <br><br>Check out my full review which includes more pictures of <a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html"">Lego Escape from the Dragon's Prison here.</a><br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/Castle/dragonprisonfront.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>As always with our Lego sets, we first look to the minifigs when deciding set worth.<br>Suitable army builders all, we get two ""Lion Knights"" and two ""Dragon Knights"". I have been hoping that Lego will expand the kingdoms beyond just these two, but so far these are what we get. The Dragons are generally considered the baddies and the Lions the goodies.<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/Castle/dragonprisonfigsgoodies.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>As evidenced by the pictures, the level of detail in Lego's minifig printing is steadily getting better. I especially like the face printing on the knight on the left, his stubble chin and scuffed up look is unique. The knight on the right features a reversible head, with the smirky smile on one side and an open-mouthed expression of horror on the other. Notice the fine detail in the printing of his torso piece.<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/Castle/dragonprisonfigsbaddies.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>In almost all points, I find the Dragon Knights to be superior to their Lion counterparts. Although the minifig on the left is a little goofy for my tastes, the fully armored figure on the right is one of the best designed Lego Castle figures ever. You would be hard pressed to find a more perfect example of Lego Castle goodness than this beauty!<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/Castle/dragonprisonbadknightarmor.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>Just look at this bad boy! His armor is beautifully detailed and the colors are just right to produce the baddest looking knight in the whole Lego Dragon Kingdoms lineup. He looks like he is tough enough to take on a whole army of Lion knights single-handedly!<span><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html""><br><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/Castle/dragonprisonbadknight.jpg[/img]</span></a><br></span><br>This figure's head is also double-sided, with a cocky-looking smile on one side and an angry sneer on the other. Without his armor piece on, he still looks like one mean cookie. Notice again the level of detail in the torso print. He is also the only figure in this set to feature printed legs, which match perfectly with his torso piece.<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/Castle/castleandprisonopposingknights.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>The only Lion Knight that looks to be a match for this nasty Dragon Knight is the equally armored guy from 7947 Prison Tower Rescue. Pictured side-by-side above, you can see the obvious similarities between these two opposing knights. For more comparison pictures, visit my <a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-prison-tower.html"">Prison Tower Rescue review.</a><br><br>Another great element of the Lego Dragon's Prison set is the horse complete with richly colored barding and imposing head armor.<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/Castle/dragonprisonknightonhorse.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>The ballista is a seemingly weak weapon, comprised of a couple of wagon wheels, a few spears, and the ever-ridiculous flick-fire missile set-up on top. I guess the Lion knight is supposed to use the ballista to charge the gates of the prison, but it doesn't look to me as if that would get him anywhere but seated on his can smiling sheepishly up at the Dragon fellow up in the bastion about to unleash the crossbow fury. The flick-fire missiles don't really go that far either. So all in all, I'd say the Lion dudes have brought the proverbial ""knife to a gun fight"".<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/Castle/dragonprisonfrontmainbuilding.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>The actual prison building, while a bit on the smallish side, is a fun mini building that allows for several playable scenarios. The two gate pieces are appropriately imposing. On the right is a jail cell, hence the ""Prison"" name, accessible only from the back. On the left is a small room where a red ruby is displayed, clearly visible from the outside of the structure, as apparently the Dragon Knights like to advertise in hope of encouraging thieves to attack their prison.<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/Castle/dragonprisonback.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>On top of the building is a small catapult, seen above being operated by the loyal and intelligent horse. Completely useless as far a repelling attackers, unless one happens to be standing still directly in the line of fire. I hate these types of catapults with my whole heart. As mentioned earlier, this set's design colors and architectural design bears remarkable resemblance to 2010's Lego Prison Tower Rescue. As you can see from this picture, it looks like these two sets could be used together in order to create an even bigger Lego Dragon kingdom!

I don't know why these two sets would be designed to be so similar, and yet you can't place them directly next to each other because the lighter green from the Lego Dragon Prison and the darker from Prison Tower Rescue don't match!<br><br><a href=""http://www.brick-building-ideas.com/lego-dragon-prison.html""><span>[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/28524159/Castle/castleandprison.jpg[/img]</span></a><br><br>Personally, I'll probably find replacement baseplates so that my 7187 Lego Dragon Prison matches the 7947 Prison Tower Rescue just right.<br><br>Overall, I would definitely recommend 7187 Escape from the Dragon's Prison. Whether you are new to the Lego Kingdoms line or are looking to expand your Dragon knight base, this is a great set with some neat pieces (i.e. beautiful horse barding) a good building design, some solid minifigs, and one wickedly cool Dragon Knight. Very reasonably priced at $19.99, this set should make its way into every Lego Castle collection.

"aplbomr79","2011-11-19T01:29:51.953Z","A lot of Castle items for $20","<p>Another great add-on for the Green Dragon Army. &nbsp;This set can be a great add-on to the 7947 Prison Tower Rescue. &nbsp;4 Mini-Figs, a Green Dragon Barded horse with a knight (with the throw-back helm), a good many weapons, and other rare items make this set worth the money. &nbsp;</p><p>Besides, the Green Dragon design and Colour Scheme reach the heights of the WolfPack, Black Falcons, and the Forestmen factions in the Castle Realm. &nbsp;Even with the small selection of sets available in the 'Kingdoms' releases, are we witnessing a new Golden Era of LEGO Castle? &nbsp;This set (even small) only strengthens this argument.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is great - with a great action scene. &nbsp;LEGO Kingdoms is a site for sore eyes... harkens back to the mid-80's-early 90's. &nbsp;I am still cheering the fact that TLG has moved to smaller boxes... &nbsp;Less room to store, more store front area for more LEGO sets... &nbsp;I cannot find a negative on the smaller boxes.</p><div>Besides for folded instruction booklets, what can you say about LEGO instructions that is negative nowadays? &nbsp;Very complete and SO much better than those dating back over 10 years ago... &nbsp;very easy to follow.</div><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Parts</span></p><div>TLG has figured out that the more 'unique' parts that they put into a set, the more desirable sets are for collectors and AFOLs. &nbsp;Yes, it is a marketing gimmick, but one that works. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is a black horse and accompanying barding for the Green Dragon Knights. &nbsp;This is the only set in the 'Kingdoms' theme that has this barding. &nbsp;However, would it hurt TLG to include a brown or white horse for the Greenies? &nbsp;I am sure that any faction did not look to just board black horses.</div><div><br></div><div>There are a number of Green and Brown plates; Dark Grey and Brown longstuds; 4 gate pieces (a HUGE plus for a set this small); a lot of cheese pieces; quite a few weapons; treasure; and a number of Gold pieces (cones, triangle slope, etc.)<br><br>There are only 2 shields; both being Green Dragon - I am not sure why TLG still insists on limiting the amount of Shields, but they continue this with the set. &nbsp;I would have like to see at least 1 Lion shield.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The set comes with 2 Green Dragon Knights and 2 Lion Knights. &nbsp;To be honest, I thought that this set should have been more partial to the Green Dragons than the Lion Knights. &nbsp;Instead of the 'captive' Lion Knight, TLG could have had another Green Dragon Knight, or at least a 'civilian' castle fig instead of one of the Lion Knights. &nbsp;It is hard to build a large Green Dragon Army that can equate the Lion Knight Army when all the sets have equal amounts of either side, or favor the Lion Knights.</p><p>However, the minifigs are great. &nbsp;The Classic Helm on the Green Dragon Knight is almost worth the set's price - almost. &nbsp;The other three are pretty tame, but add into building strong armies for either side. &nbsp;Again, I would wish that TLG would have included more Shields... &nbsp;(the lack of shields only bolsters the price of shields on BrickLink). &nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is straight-forward with little in the way of being new. &nbsp;It only takes 20-40 minutes to complete... but that means that in a short while, the young-uns have a set that they can get lost in.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I am not a fan of the 'break-away' aspect that this model (and 7948 Outpost Attack) include. &nbsp;I am not sure why it even exists in this model...<br><br>But over-all, you have a working set that allows for a soldier and treasure being 'rescued' from the Green Dragons.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The set is complete and enjoyable to build. &nbsp;It offers some great pieces and Mini-Figs to boot. &nbsp;I purchased one for full price when it came out - and then purchased another one a few days ago due to a Target Sale (plus coupon) and got the set for $12.50. &nbsp;It is a great stand-alone set, and works great as an add-on to 7947 Prison Tower Rescue. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Since there is no foreseeable release of a Green Dragon's Fortress, combining a couple of these sets with Prison Tower Rescue could create a formidable and defensible fortress for the Greenies.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"icepick","2011-10-18T16:02:38.6Z","Can't say no to dragon horse armor","<p>This is a great set, not perfect, but pretty close.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>Great parts. Been wanting some of those gates for a long time. Also the dragon horse armor is unparalleled in awe-inspiration.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I love the goofy one and the other Dragon. Dude with the soul patch is also awesome. The Dragon knight is probably my favorite minifig ever with his classic helmet and printed armor.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Nice build. Solid. Good parts. Not confusing.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It was actually bigger than I thought. These kingdoms sets can be a bit small, but this one felt right. Is still probably a tad anemic for $20, but since I bought it largely for the horse armor I can't complain.&nbsp; :)<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Not the most playable (it's a little unimaginative honestly), but it's a nice solid build with great minifigs. I'd say it's a must for kingdoms fans and highly recommended to anyone else as well.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,4

Plus other Castle sets where you have a length of Castle wall and ramparts being besieged or defended. If I've got any complaints it that it feels like this is a set that is part of a larger build and model for the Dragon Knights. Hence feelings I get that there should be more to this set going on.<br><br>What you get in addition to this Castle front/facade with a prison and gemstone being guarded are 4 minifigures, rat and horse. The rat is a cute &amp; amusing afterthought for something to include in this set. The horse I particularly like the new print for its barding, helmet and the pseudo unicorn horn on it.<br><br>There are two Dragon Knights and two Lion Knights. All four are pretty good. One of the Lion Knights is a prisoner that his companion is there to rescue. You've the Dragon Knight archer attacking from above and then Dragon Knight in plate mail with the helmet and visor that lifts up. The print for him and the new dark metallic grey color for the plastic molds are great. I've commented too before about the new style of wide-brimmed helmets for Castle and liking those. So this is a good way to get more of those pieces and have some new Castle minifigures.<br><br>The final piece I'd say is the Spear Launcher/Catapult build which is a dead ringer for set <a title=""View full details of set 5618: Troll Warrior"" href=""../../detail/?Set=5618-1"">5618</a> Troll Warrior from the Fantasy Era theme of 2007-2008.

I actually like that, no need to reinvent the wheel if there's a perfectly good model to used already.<br><br>It's a good build over all, fairly easy and quick to build. Plus me and my daughter had fun together. I'm used to some of the far older Castle sets where some builds for the ramparts and walls would have been all one piece instead of more of a build.

<ul>
    <li>Very wicked Black Knight. I'd say he's some sort of a high commander. If he had a dark chrome sword that would have been just too sweet.</li>
    <li>Four minifigs, which is pretty good for a $20 set</li>
    <li>The faces are pretty unique, the crazed lunatic looking Dragon Knight, a scuffed battle hardened lion knight and a frightened lion knight.</li>

    <li>Easily combines with the Prison Tower Rescue (<a href=""../../detail/?Set=7947-1"" title=""View full details of set 7947: Prison Tower Rescue"">7947</a>) to create a larger fortified prison</li>

    <li>not much of a con but you can easily walk around the thing to get to the back unless you use your imagination or fortify it with more legos </li>
    <li>Not much of a stand alone set but works great when combined with similar dark castle sets</li>

"Ernst","2012-05-17T13:10:59.16Z","Small prison, great set. In fact a must have one.","<p>Overall 5 bricks : Really a great looking set with good playing possibilities, a lot of new usefull parts and finally a Dragon Knight with a horse. The set offers a prison, small treasure chamber, catapult, spearthrower and 4 minifigures for a good price. It's also very good to combine with the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7947-1"">Prison Tower</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 4 bricks : Building this set is fun but not exceptional, it is very nice&nbsp;how Lego managed to put all the features (jail, treasure chamber, catapult, good entrance)&nbsp;in a small building like this. The whole build is with small bricks and offers when finished a good and stable result. The main entrance is made of a gate with 2 great doors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : First&nbsp;of all the 2 Dragon Knights who are great, the soldier for the great face and of course the Dragon Knight with armor, and yes WITH horse&nbsp;with great barding and battle helmet. Also the shield is great, the first ovoid shaped for a Dragon Knight. Also a remark for the gate fences, besides these parts all very usefull parts in this set. Missing is a shield for the Lion Knight. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks : Every kid can play with a set like this for hours. A small Castle with 4 Knights including a horseman, a catapult and (silly) spearthrower provides maximum playing possibilities. Added to other sets even more, the Dragon Knights can for example enter the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=10223-1"">Joust</a> now too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : Price is €20,00 MISB and just look at the content in this set, defenitly a good deal. I found it for even less and paid €13,50 (including sending) so a very good deal for me.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
