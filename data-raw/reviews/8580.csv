"Harmonious_Building","2011-05-16T21:16:49.167Z","Royal ride.","His Royal Highness finally has a new way to get around, and perhaps it's inevitable that comparisons are drawn between this set and 6044, the King's Carriage that came with the Royal Knights line. The first thing that should be said in favour of the 2011 carriage is that it is certainly a great deal more attractive than its Royal Knights counterpart. The red, white, and brown colour scheme is much more tasteful and realistic compared to the black and blue, and the arches and curved roof are certainly a great deal more pleasing. The King minifig (who I sometimes refer to as a prince, really, to distinguish him from the one that came with King's Castle) fits comfortably inside the carriage with minimal fiddling, even when he is packing his greatsword, and, as always, the treasure chest sits in a ludicrously precarious position, ripe for stealing.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>However, this added size comes with a cost: the 2011 carriage looks very oversized compared to the other Lion Knight structures. In particular, it's almost as large as the outpost in 7948 and certainly has no hope of fitting through the portcullis of King's Castle, while the old King's Carriage, for all its faults, is capable of traversing the side entrance to the Royal Knights Castle. Funnily enough, I feel, though, that the new carriage scales quite nicely with the houses in Medieval Market Village. Of course, how you wish to display all of this is up to you.</div><div><br></div><div>In all of this, little has been said about the two tree hideouts that come with this set as well. It seems as though the Dragon Knights are trying to reinvent themselves as bandits, and both of the accompanying woody structures provide excellent traps for ensnaring and smashing do-gooders. The web-covered hideout is versatile enough to serve as a hiding place for any bad guy, really, and the giant swinging hammer is of particular amusement and works very well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>All of this comes with a price tag of $40, which seems a little bit steep to me. The King minifig is the only one out of the four who is of particular note, but his inclusion is moot if you already have King's Castle (unless you fancy initiating a Game of Thrones type deal or something like that). It's a decent and attractive addition if you've already got a number of other Kingdoms sets on display, but it's hard to get a lot of leverage out of it if you're just starting out with Castle.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,2

(Price-per-piece wise, but very good set)","<h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Minifigs</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The Minifigs in this set are very nice. The coach driver is absolutely nothing new for he has an oldish&nbsp;Atlantis&nbsp;head. The first dragon knight has an archer helmet (That's what I call it) has a very&nbsp;overused&nbsp;face. I have like fifteen of these! But apparently there is a variant.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=56484"">http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=56484</a>. His helmet is slightly different than last years model, for it's less glossy. Which is better? I frankly have no idea. His&nbsp;ax&nbsp;has a new colored blade as I'm aware of, for it's the color of his helmet. The other dragon knight has the old agents/robber face. very nice to get a new head that works well for these guys. He's armed with a spear and a fish. This guys ready to slap the king silly! The King has a somewhat rare head, only being in the $100 castle and the advent calendar that was available for approximately three seconds before it sold out. I'm a proud owner of both. He has a usual gold crown, nothing new. His cape is Dark red, which if you're a Spartan collector like me you own about three million of those. It's still nice all the same. His sword is chrome, not gold chrome, but just chrome. The torso and leg patterns are new, and work well for a pope. I personally like this outfit <i style=""font-weight: bold; "">way </i>more than the other one, whose crown came off all the time 'cause of the silly breastplate. 5/5.</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space: pre; "">	</span>Tree 1 (Hammer)</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The first tree has a nice design to it and a working hammer mechanism that can smash the silly horse heads! A nice deign for a hammer but it got in my way for moving the tree around.</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space: pre; "">	</span>Tree 2 (The other one)</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>I really don't know how to describe this tree. I like it more than the first one but that's my honest opinion. There's a silly flick fire mechanism on this! I really hate those. The spider web is new. It has the same shape as the previous one but has a bar about the thickness of a lightsaber blade. Same material though.</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Carriage</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The carriage has a nice design, though the&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;part of the build was kind of boring. The back of the carriage has a treasure chest on it. There's a mechanism to launch it into the air so the Dragon knights can catch it and buy themselves better faces and more threatening weapons. The carriage itself has a nice color scheme of red and white. Good ol' Wisconsin Badger's colors! Oh! Did I leave out the horses? The horses are very nice with exquisite printing. Their headgear is the same from the kings castle.&nbsp;</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Overall</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The Kings Carriage is a great set with nice colors, minifigs, and elements. Total rip off for price, though. This is the first summer Kingdoms set I've gotten and I hope to review many more. Great news though! I'm gonna try getting pictures in here so you don't have to read these boring words and then I can double your loading time! Win Win situation! But anyway, great set but still outrageously priced.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"Lint","2013-06-18T08:24:56.15Z","Good set that suffered from a horrible RRP","<p><b>The Skinny</b></p><p>I finally picked this set up after it was discounted to 50% off. A 50% discount was what it took to convince me that this set that contained 4 minifigures, 2 horses and a couple of trees was worth buying and even then I was still on the fence about the purchase. It was the unicorn horses that tipped me over! Overall it is a good set, however had I bought it for $70 AUD which was full RRP I would have been fuming.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Unicorn helms for the horses, and horses! You can never have enough horses!<br></li><li>The hammer gimmick has a fantastic construction</li><li>Kingdoms minifigures are great as usual. I really can't get enough of that shiny dark grey plastic the dragon knights sport.</li><li>A lot of great parts such as tree fronds, spider webs, more hilarious minifig expressions and chrome swords</li><li>The playability you can get out of a horsedrawn carriage and a bunch of knights is endless. This set could also be easily reconstructed into other adventures although it is a shame that lego no longer recommends alternative builds outside of the Creator line.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Nothing revolutionary in the building experience space<br></li><li>Hammer gimmick doesn't make much sense during play. I know the hammer is there to scare the horses into stopping but just about anyone is going to see if the hammer will smash the carriage to smithereens and it just isn't powerful enough.<br></li><li>Trees are a little underwhelming in design but thankfully very stable</li><li>Includes a fish. It makes no sense whatsover in the context of this set and by the time this set was released were a dime a dozen.<br></li><li>Of course the RRP</li></ul>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><br></p><p>Horsedrawn carriages are a standard knights lego staple and it's always great to see all the different ways Lego come up with to build a carriage. This one's design is by no means a stinker. I highly recommend this set for the parts and general playability.<br></p>",TRUE,3,5,2,5,3
"myater","2012-11-13T06:09:01.353Z","Great playability and surprise storage!","<p>I picked up this set while in South Korea in October 2011 since I just hadn't seen it in the stores in my area stateside, or if I had the price seemed to be pushing me away, I can't remember now. &nbsp;In South Korea at the Lotte Mart that I got it at it cost me about 32000 won, which at the time, the conversion made it about $35 US. &nbsp;After getting back to the US I finally saw it in the stored and realized the price I payed for the standard shelf price was a better price over there.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions - <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The box and instructions we printed with the standard languages and I loved the cover art. &nbsp;Sometimes it is dull, but this time I found it quite enjoyable, even if my son didn't care.</span></h4><h4>Parts<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;- I thought the new arches and varying sizes of wagon wheels were great. &nbsp;The horses are absolutely beautiful, enough my wife was enthralled with them and wished we had more horses like that. &nbsp;After opening the box we found two small plastic storage boxed stamped with the LEGO logo inside. &nbsp;I have looked around on the web a little and haven't seen anything like it, I am sure I could look harder, but it appears to me that the purchase in South Korea had a extra bonus in that country of the small storage boxes included. &nbsp;I was worried about a knock off but since I bought it at Lotte Mart (like Walmart, but cleaner, nicer, and better dressed people). &nbsp;Also Lotte Mart has a mini TRU section in the toy department, which is&nbsp;licensed&nbsp;to be there by Toys R Us. I am fairly certain that it was not a knock off product, but if it was they got it exactly right.</span></h4><h4>Minifigures - <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The King is obviously the centerpiece, but the printing on all of them is wonderful.&nbsp;</span></h4><div><b>The build - </b>This was a good build, and easy enough my son was able to accomplish it easily at 6 1/2 years old. &nbsp;Only a couple times did he need a little reminder to slow down so he didn't skip a step. &nbsp;He was unsure how the wheels would work at different sizes, and was amazed that they didn't create a un-level&nbsp;carriage.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The completed model</b>&nbsp;- Great final product, two horse carriage with a driver and the effect of going through a Dark Woods environment due to the spiderweb makes for a wonderful&nbsp;scenario.</div>
<h4>Summary<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;- I am&nbsp;defiantly glad I got this one, and getting it in another country made it better for the family since it was a return home present.&nbsp;Added to the included mini storage containers for the people, horses, web, and&nbsp;utensils, to prevent damage or loss was awesome!</span></h4>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Ernst","2011-12-25T10:53:50.493Z","Very good set, a bit expensive maybe.","<p>Overall rating for this set is 5 stars: it is very complete, a strong carriage and has nice features. A must have for the Castle (Kingdoms) collector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building experience gets 4 stars: the&nbsp;building scheme is logical and very good to do even for the younger Lego fans. A good mix between small and bigger parts. Nice feature is the construction with the big hammer, although not really realistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts get 4 stars: it was close to a perfect 5 because almost everything you wish for is present. Some small points of critism are: 1 more Dragon Knight would definitly be welcome and a sword or spear for the Lion Knight that rides the carriage. A nice detail are the horses, not totally white this time but a nice print on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability gets 5 stars: everything is present to make a nice battle for the Kings treasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money 4 stars: price per piece is good but the price for&nbsp;a set (€39,95) is not really cheap for a set you don't really ""need"" for a good Castle Kingdoms scenery. The set in total and how it is equiped is worth the money.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"arctrooper","2011-08-22T18:32:49.813Z","Good","<p>This is my first review, so I hope it turns out OK.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>There were two instruction booklets for this set, one for the carriage and one for the trees.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>There is a nice variety of good parts. The big wheels on the back of the carriage are really nice, as are the white arches on the side and the larger archers on the trees are great.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Nothing really special. The king doesn't have armor, but otherwise he is the same as the king that comes with the castle. The other figs have the same, overused faces.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The onl part of the build that stood out to me were the sides, which kept falling over or snapping while i put them together with too much pressure. It wasn't too challenging, though.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>The set looks nice, although there are holes on the roof of the carriage that bothers me. Also, the carriage cannot fit through the gate of the castle.</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
