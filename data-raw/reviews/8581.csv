"Matt_Z_","2011-06-04T19:04:37.417Z","A solid addition to the Castle Theme","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>I was very excited when I first saw photos of 7189 Mill Village Raid and was even more thrilled when I obtained the set. From the photos, I could see that there were many new elements in this set and I was hoping it would fit&nbsp;seamlessly&nbsp;within my castle theme. I wasn't&nbsp;disappointed.&nbsp;I'll give a rundown of some pros and cons and finish off with a conclusion.<br><div><br></div><div><b>Pros</b></div><div><br></div><div>- <b>A multitude of new elements</b>: Comes with 3 hens (2 white, 1 brown), 2 goats (which are sized quite nicely in comparison to other LEGO animals such as Cows, Horses, etc.), 1 horse (which is spotted, with shaders over its eyes-very detailed), 1 pig (black spots, very unique), 2 pails (well designed and come with extra handles if needed), 4 barn-style windows (helping give the barn an aged look) and 3 new doors (sturdier and more realistic than their previous counterparts; open and close smoothly). Other notable parts which have been seen before but are not common include pitchforks, ladder, apples, basket,&nbsp;peasants&nbsp;hood, and many more.</div><div><br></div><div>- <b>Two unique buildings: </b>The windmill and barn are two excellent buildings. The windmill has 4 unique blades on the outside and a modular gear design on the interior. With a turn of the crank situated about the back, you can watch as the gears work to turn the blades on the front. Very cool. The barn is able to maintain a classic look while providing a lot of playability. The roof opens via hinges and the barn itself is hinged in the middle, allowing it to be opened and accessed. Inside there are 2 stables with gates. There is a grassy area upon which the farm animals can graze/sleep, etc. (There is also room in here to store a couple more horses that may be without a home in your current castle set-up!). 2 large doors and 4 barn-style windows are also present. On the top floor/attic there is a pulley system which elevates the basket, bringing food up to the animals. It is controlled by the ""metallic"" rooster situated on top of the barn, which is a neat touch. For added fun, there's a trapdoor in the attic! There is also a chicken coup up there as well. On the exterior of the barn there are a few plants/flowers for the animals to eat, as well as a large sunflower which is really cool.</div><div><br></div><div>- <b>Other cool parts</b>: There is a cart for the horse to pull, a barrel of gold, 3 dragon knights with weapons, a farm lady, a&nbsp;peasant and&nbsp;his son (presumably), and much more.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Cons</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Can't really fault this set in many ways. The price tag is a bit hefty, but that's to be expected with a newly released set. Some people may&nbsp;criticize&nbsp;the base of the mill, but I think it works well as it allows you to rotate the windmill. Others may be skeptical of the roof design on the barn but I think it is unique and offers extended playability. All in all, this set doesn't have any major flaws.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Conclusion</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>If you are a collector or admirer of the Castle theme line in the&nbsp;slightest, the acquisition of 7189 Mill Village Raid is a no-brainer. If 10193 Medieval Market Village is the glove on your right hand, 7189 Mill Village Raid is the glove on your left. Both sets pair amazingly with each other. Furthermore, if you collect other themes you won't be disappointed as this set offers many new pieces; especially animals! Overall, a high&nbsp;caliber set that provides both an entertaining build, plenty of playability, and fantastic new elements.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Until next time.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>MattZ&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"dougts","2011-06-06T23:42:01.473Z","Fantastic Well-Designed Set","<p>It seem LEGO has of late heard the call toward throwing in more civilian-style sets - this one being in the Castle/Kingdoms theme. &nbsp;I must say this is really such a well-designed and executed set with a plethora of qualities, it's really difficult to find much to criticize here.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Plenty of animals - pig, horse, 2 goats, rooster, 2 hens</li><li>6 minifigs - farm family (dad/mom/boy), and 3 raiders (archer/sword/axe)</li><li>Well designed buildings with great play features</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Maybe the price? &nbsp;Not much else to complain about really</li></ul>
<p>Let's start with the windmill - a rotating crank turns both the windmill arms and the grindstone located on the inner lower level area. &nbsp;There's even a little level that dumps the full hopper of ground ""flour"" out of the grindstone area. &nbsp;Pretty neat and no wasted space or parts here.</p><p><br></p><p>The barn is about twice as big as the windmill, and comes with a hinged opening for play, a well-camoflouged crank that raises and lowers a big basket full of apples up to the loft of the barn, a level-activated trap door, and stylish looking doors and windows.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Both building comes with flip open roofs for easy access, but they are well designed and look pretty good closed as well.</p><p>A simple cart behind the horse, complete with barrel of gold finishes off the set - along with the livestock of course.</p><p><br></p><p>Playability here is top notch with all the people as well as animals, moving cart, action featuers on both buildings, etc.</p><p>And the topper in all of this is that it just looks fantastic. &nbsp;Unlike many sets designed more for play, this one looks fairly realistic and like a complete set of building - no front shells with open backs, or mash-ups like the infamous Home One, Cloud City, or the upcoming&nbsp;Echo Base.</p><p><br></p><p>This is really a top notch set, and I can't say much more about it other than well done LEGO.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Shistavanen_brick","2012-03-13T16:23:10.06Z","No apples for you, dragon knights!","<h4>Initial thoughts.</h4><div>The very first time I saw the box for this set I thought to myself, <i><b>wow</b></i>! - but felt I didn't really need it, at the time being. Not that I don't like the Kingdoms or Castle theme (being a history enthusiast), but Star Wars stuff often gets the better of me. Then it happened, many stores suddenly put 50% off from many themes here in Sweden that are being discontinued (2010-2011). Among them was the Kingdoms theme. At that point I just couldn't resist and picked up a few different boxes. Of them I'd say that this is my absolute favorite. Here below I will try to explain why that is, and why you need to get this...</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigures.</h4><div>We get no less than 6 awesome minifigures in this set, each in their own right. First are the villagers (perhaps they are a family?).</div><div><br></div><div><b>Lady</b>: This girl comes with a nice blue dress with printing. She also comes with an amber-coloured hairpiece and her head has two faces. One that you would like to be smile to, and the other to run as far away as you possible can from. I think she and the boy are my favorites of the peasant family.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Peasant</b>: He has brown clothing with some printing and looks very medieval (they all do, obviously, since it's a Kingdoms set). Also comes with a two sided head, which makes playability even better.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Boy</b>: The boy is just cool. Green and blue clothing with some nice printing. His legs are smaller, nice ""illusion"" there, as with Anakin or Yoda in Star Wars sets. The boy can be placed on the wagon as the box shows and then the race is on!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Dragon knights</b>: You get 3 of them with different weapons and shields. They also have cool printing on the torso and funny looking faces. It's just perfect, if you imagine them sneaking up to the mill to try and filch some apples, they ought to have some smirking faces. Of course they should not succeed!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Other than that, you get some really nice animals and accessories. A new horse, some hens, a pig and the most awesome goats! You also get a cool wagon and a few gold pieces.</div><div><br></div><h4>The barn.&nbsp;</h4><div>What I like about this set the most is that LEGO really did an effort to make it feel and look Medieval. Building the barn in brick style is an absolute delight. It has two main sections that are attached so you can fold it together to make it look like an actual building. One of the sections has place for livestock, horses or whatever you want to put in there. There are some details right outside the small wickets keeping the horses indoors, like a water or feeding bucket. There are plenty of windows and the outside is decorated with I suppose are flowers, then there's a big sunflower too!</div><div><br></div><div>The other section is like a cool storage area where the family can stockpile hay, apples and other things they might need. There are plenty of extra pieces included to help the family do their job. Hayforks and buckets to name a few. If you already have vegetables or other LEGO pieces that could pass as Kingdoms' items this barn could bring you plenty of hours of playtime. For an adult, there is some serious MOCability to go around. Among the best part for this section are the big barn doors and the wince mechanism. When you turn the wheathervane on top of the roof you can bring the goodies (apples) up to the storage area. There's even a hidden trap-door for unwelcome (spell, dragon knights!) guests.</div><div><br></div><div>Across the both section is a very cool thatched roof. Almost like a dollhouse, you can easily open them up to reveal stuff or play inside. The set is already there, a winner waiting to happen!</div><div><br></div><h4>The mill.</h4><div>Just like the barn, the mill was a treat to build. No matter the age-group, you are bound to like this build. Probably for different reasons but the outcome will remain the same. It just looks authentic and has some mud-qualities to it. It has a nice door and the wind wheel function works well. There are some white pieces included that are supposed to be flour, I guess. Nice goods to sell at the Medieval Market. Another thing with the mill is that you can turn it either way you want, in case you want to break symmetry and have it displayed in your own fashion.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>A nice, not too war-focused set.</li><li>Highly diverse and interesting.</li><li>Lots of minifigs and extra parts.</li><li>First ever, goats!</li><li>Display friendly.</li></ul></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>Too little space in the mill.</li><li>Perhaps the price.</li></ul></div>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4
"Snowtrooper119","2011-10-31T03:23:14.193Z","When Dragon knights attack","<p>When I first saw this set I became very excited. It looked really good with all the new elements and the general design of the set and so I decided to get it as soon as possible.</p>
<h4>Box/instructions</h4>
<p>The box has the standard kingdoms box art which looks quite good. The box also happens to be quite big. The instructions look the same as the box and comes in two booklets.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>&nbsp;There is quite a good selection of minifigures in this set. The three villagers all have double sided faces showing different expressions and have some nice printing. The three dragon nights are the same as all the others except the helmets aren't glossy like the previous years sets but are nice all the same and they have some fresh faces that weren't around in last years sets.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are many new parts in this set as well as good use of existing ones. I really like the animals, especially the chickens. I also like the&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;used for the blades of the windmill. The colours in the set are really nice with a combination of brown, tan and darker tan and it really feels like a medieval farm with thatch roofing.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<DIV>The build was simple with standard building techniques and nothing really exciting or difficult. It was enjoyable though.</DIV>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Looks really good. It is of a good size and fits in well with the size ratios of the other kingdoms sets. I really like the winch for the bucket which is the bird on the roof, it is an ingenious idea. The barn can open up and it looks like two barns and both sides look decent enough. The windmill looks really good but the back is open but it lets you see the gears on the inside. You can make pretty cool scenes with this set especially if you combine it with the Medieval market village.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<DIV>I highly recommend this set to fans of castle and medieval villages. It has good pieces, nice minifigures and looks great overall.&nbsp;</DIV>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"mathew","2012-07-05T11:51:27.73Z","It's a Lego Barn","<p>I'll be honest, Mill Village Raid as a whole set is just not that interesting.&nbsp; The main portion consists of building a barn out of Lego.&nbsp; It's a nice looking barn, but not very exciting to either build or display.&nbsp; The mill is the real stand out portion of this set, but it's rather small.&nbsp; I've since parted out the barn and paired&nbsp;the mill&nbsp;with Gandalf's Arrival from Lord of the Rings.&nbsp; The two with their similar color palatte compliment each other rather nicely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to sum it up, I recommend buying the set for the mill portion.&nbsp; The minifigs are nice but nothing new (aside from some farm animals).&nbsp;&nbsp;The barn is...well, a barn.&nbsp; Some may like it.&nbsp; I just find it too bland to take up space in a display.&nbsp; Kids may like playing with it however.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3
"tvih","2012-06-06T18:58:01.803Z","A very fun ""civilian-themed"" set","<p>I just ""rediscovered"" my old love for Legos, and this set got the ""honor"" of being my first new set in probably 15 years or so, as despite Kingdoms starting to get very rare - unfortunately, what with Castle being my favorite theme back then as well as now - to find in stores, I managed to find this set at a discount. And a great first set it was even discount notwithstanding, as you'll see if you read on.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box looks nice. The images portray the contents well, and in funny situations (apple, meet head - and a gluttonous little pig!). It's oversized for the amount of bricks inside, but that seems to be the norm these days.</p><p>Instructions were very clear and easy to follow. At times I actually wished there would've been more pieces per step, but I suppose it's better this way with younger builders in mind.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set isn't the biggest there is in terms of both amount of bricks as well as physical size, but it's still actually quite nice in both respects. Even having seen all the pics, I was still slightly surprised by the size. The windmill and the barn together are basically as large as my old and beloved Black Falcon's Fortress!</p><p>What's also nice is that there aren't that many large, ""exclusive"" parts, and most of the buildings are actually made up from a lot of smaller parts. This is obviously a good thing if you want to use the set's parts to build something else.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are six minifigures included. You get your three villagers, as well as the three soldiers intent on harassing said villagers. When I played with Lego sets as a kid, I was always combat-oriented, but the villagers do add a lot of possibilities for playing with the set.</p><p>I must say though that I'm not a huge fan of the ""skirt"" female minifigs seem to get these days. They make the minifig quite inflexible in terms of posing it and such, and honestly they don't look that good. Similar problems abound with the ""short pants"" of the other male villager - I assume it's meant to be a kid. The short pants can't be adjusted to put the minifig into a sitting position or lean up/down, and therefore two out of three villagers are a bit inflexible. But the third villager is good, and the soldiers also look very nice.</p><p>In addition to the human minifigs you also get a bunch of animals. They add a nice touch to the set.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Building the set was straightforward enough. At times I got a bit confused with having three bags of parts for one building, and had to look for where the part I was looking for is lurking. Would've helped if I had a larger area to work on so that I could've just poured all the contents of the bags into their own piles, which would've eliminated the problem and made the build a lot faster - now it took me a good 2,5 hours.</p><p>There's nothing really difficult about the build technically, but it was still a fun set to build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>As mentioned earlier, the completed set is surprisingly sizeable. It also looks very nice - quite colorful compared to my old, worn sets. Being civilian buildings, they're also a standout from other newer Kingdoms sets, almost all of which are ""military"" in nature.</p><p>I also really liked the mechanical functionality found in both the windmill and the barn, something that wasn't really there with old Castle sets in my youth. With the mill you can turn a crank to make the sails/blades turn, as well as rotate the container at the bottom to take out what I assume is meant to be flour, represented by white cylinders. As for the barn, you get a functional winch for the apple basket. Trying these out made me smile - oh the fun I would've gotten out of them as a kid!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I can't really say anything bad about the set. I must admit that I can't really compare to any new sets from personal experience, but it was a fun experience to build this. Quite a contrast to building my old collection - which is what I've been doing for the last week - with very loose and often even broken parts, not to mention very worn in general. The set feels very solidly build, looks good, and the functional winch and windmill crank are very nice additions. The two civilian minifigs were indeed slightly disappointing due to their inflexibility, but given that the set gets just about everything else right, can't really complain.</p><p>In short - highly recommended! If you can still find one, that is :)</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Faefrost","2016-12-21T19:57:54.74Z","One of the most perfect Castle sets ever released","<p>This was a set that was sadly under appreciated at the time of its release. Which is a shame. It is amazing. Oneof the most distinct Castle sets ever released. A true civilian setting of a farm and mill. With a full barn structure and a host of animals. You get a full family of Castle era civilians, 3 Green Dragon Raiders Goats, Pigs, Chickens, a Horse and Cart. Produce. A nicely working windmill that spits out white round &quot;bags of flour&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a standalone set it is amazing. The build on the barn alone is worth it. So many great parts and techniques. The Windmill is a bit technicish and not as nice. But as a compliment to the over the top Classic Medieval Market Village, this set is a must have.&nbsp;</p>

"naf","2013-07-26T16:42:54.16Z","Another great villager set to add to your Lego Castle collection.","<p>I'm a sucker for a well designed civilian set. &nbsp;This set does not disappoint. &nbsp;The buildings are well designed, and look historically accurate. &nbsp;There are no big wall panels here, most of the buildings are built using smaller bricks which add to the detail. &nbsp;The windmill turns with a crank in the back, and it has a moving grindstone inside. &nbsp;The set comes with a few 1x1 round white bricks to act as ground flour. &nbsp;The mill rotates on it's base so it can always face into the wind.</p><p>The barn has a main level where the animals live, and rafters where hay and produce are stored. &nbsp;There is a string winch that can be used to bring heavy items up to this level. &nbsp;The barn opens up on hinged bricks to better access the inside. &nbsp;The flowers on the side of the barn add a much needed dash of color to a set that's predominately brown and gray.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great build experience. &nbsp;Lack of large ""juniorized"" bricks results in detailed looking buildings.</li><li>6 minifigures, 3 peasants and 3 soldiers.</li><li>Animals! &nbsp;Pigs, goats, chickens, and a gray horse! &nbsp;I haven't seen this type of print on a horse, it might be unique to the set.</li><li>Mill and barn roof construction is clever, as is the sunflower.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The two booklets were loose in the box. &nbsp;Mine were mangled and ripped. &nbsp;Wish they would secure them with plastic and some cardboard backing.</li><li>I feel like there should be a third element, like a small water well to round out the village scene.</li><li>Feels a tad expensive, could stand to be $10 cheaper.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is a great set. &nbsp;I have it set up with my Medieval Market Village, and the two work very well together. &nbsp;I think the entire Kingdoms line is great as a whole. &nbsp;I think it manages to be a bit of a throwback to the 1980's Castle lines, while being new and fresh using modern pieces and building techniques. &nbsp;If you're a fan of classic Castle and/or civilian themed sets don't hesitate to pick this set up.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,3
