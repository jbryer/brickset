<p>This Advent Calendar builds into a nice selection of figures, vehicles, bits and pieces, and even a little police station, with furniture and a safe. I liked that there was that variety, rather than just figures or just tiny mini-sets. The cardboard box folds open to reveal a backdrop of 2011 City Lego sets, and a flat scene of a snow covered pond, with greenery, footprints, ski tracks and broken ice.</p>
<DIV>The 'gifts' include:</DIV>
<ul>
<li>two police officers and a dog 
<li>two criminals 
<li>an ice fisherman (nice green hooded parka, with printed fur) 
<li>Santa with backpack 
<li>a small police car (built in three stages on a small black car chassis) 
<li>a police station, (built in four stages) 
<li>two snowmobiles (one has a trailer) 
<li>a Christmas tree with presents (including a skateboard and helmet) 
<li>a snowball catapult&nbsp; 
<li>a fireplace with clear orange 1 x 1 cheese wedges for fire</li></ul>
<p>The figures all have printed torsos, including a green jacket and a grey jacket over prison stripes. The police station is four 2 x 6 wall or door sections built up and joined together. It is over 60 pieces, including brown 'timber' style bricks, blue 1 x 2 peg and 1 x 2 hole bricks, a blue 1 x 6 arch over an empty doorway, and different sized windows/bars. White slopes at the top depict a snow covered roof, but there is no proper roof or back (which makes it easier for little hands to play with it). There is a bed, a forensics desk and a safe with gold bars!&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are lots of nice spares too: there is an extra white 2 x 1 tile with Police printed on it, spare 1 x 1 brown bricks, two extra skis, an axe, a radio, handcuffs, 1 x 1 tiles and 1 x 1 round clear plates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the Santa figure has a beard piece and a backpack, I did find that I had to press reasonably hard to get the head to attach. Very small kids might need adult help with that.</p>
<p>The box art doesn't give away all the contents of the Calendar, although there is a depiction of parts on the side. So, this set should surprise kids with its contents - this set has a really good assortment of gifts inside!</p></DIV>
