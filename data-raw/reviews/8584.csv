"The_Reviewer","2011-07-22T13:07:34.793Z","pricey,but worth it.","<p>&nbsp;There is one major set in this set and that is the price;$90 dollars is kinda pricey.This is the second hoth set that is the real rebel base,but unlike the 2007 version this one focuses on the interior rather than the exterior.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>the box has the same C.Rex on it (I Hate the way how it has C.Rex).There are two instructions as usaual.I wish lego would give us instructions that have better art and with movie stills and the way how the there are two make it a pain to store since it takes up more room</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This set comes with 8 minifigs;The new Han-solo with the new hood (I like the old one better) and the new small blaster,Leah with movie-accurate hair and a strange translucent popsicle,R-3po which is really just C-3po in red,Chewbacca with a bowcaster,a Medical driod in a new color,Luke&nbsp;in bacta tank garb, and two typical snowtroopers</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Is a little tricky and a little time consuming.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>very large in fact larger than you think.</p>
<h4>The interior</h4>
<p>The interior has a small corral for the Taun-taun a few computer screens, a small crane,Radar dish satelites, small fuel tanks, gun rack, Bacta tank,some flickfire missiles guns, a small dish turret, and a catwalk that can raise and lower.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find this&nbsp;on sale buy it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,2

The hole thing all to gether i would rait a&nbsp;ten out of ten.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"sudorum","2012-01-16T16:48:14.887Z","The True Hoth Echo Base","<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Who could forget the original Hoth base? The haunting image of a large, sliding door comes to mind. Thankfully, this set expels the memories of that horror. Sure, it took a while for Lego to finally adapt Echo base into a respectable set, but better late than never. The set comes with a nice array of minifigures. We get two snowtroopers, a medical droid, Chewy, Princess Leia with a popsicle (it doesn't make much sense, but I'm not complaining), a red C3PO, a new Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo with a new hat. There's also a Taun-Taun included to spite you for having to spend money on the 7749 rendition of Echo Base.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The left side of the base has a Taun-Taun stable with a holder on which to place its reins and saddle. The gate of the stable can be lowered for access to the inside or outside of the base. There are also two flick fire missile systems on the roof and a gun turret extended from the main base. The right portion of Echo base is quite a bit more detailed. It includes Luke's healing chamber, a swivel bed, a lowering gun rack that can be accessed from the outside, and a computer station. There is a large, elevated walkway located above this. Both sides of the base have falling icicle functions that block two of the entrances. Personally, I think the base looks more complete when its sides are joined together. Separating them takes up space and makes the base resemble a large wall. Which, unfortunately, conjures up memories of its poor predecessor. Regardless of this flaw, if you own those other Hoth/Echo base sets, you might as well buy this one and complete the collection.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,3
"captain_radda_radda","2011-08-25T03:33:24.98Z","Movie accurate...yet not movie accurate...hmmm","As a huge fan of all things Hoth, I was obligated to purchase Echo Base. What a&nbsp;surprise this set was. To start, the set is not accurate to the movie version at all. It is open and exposed with a Taun-Taun stable and several turrets that obviously should not be there. Yet...the set is somewhat accurate to the true Echo Base. Luke's Bacta tank is placed inside an looks incredibly accurate to the real thing. The med-center is very accurate as well, as it includes the Medical Droid and rotating bed. The central command is accurate as well, as it includes&nbsp;several&nbsp;computers and a rotating chair. Their is also a downsized, yet&nbsp;hideous, dish turret. The set looks best when it is opened up and displayed long-ways. The door is only big enough to squeeze an Ice Cutter (rebel battle pack vehicle) or Wampa through...so if you plan on creating a ""true"" Hoth base, make sure you have the&nbsp;original Hoth ""Base"" (or door as some call it)<div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Pros:</div><div><br></div><div>The minifigs (both new, improved, and old) are fantastic. They all fit in perfectly with the set and add to the&nbsp;playability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Imperial speeder is awesome and has a nice design.</div><div><br></div><div>The E-web turret is the same as before, yet the colors seem more fitting to the set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The base is nicely sized.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>TAUN-TAUN!</div><div><br></div><div>Great play features</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div><br></div><div>The design is totally inaccurate to the movie.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Why is there a leaf...on Hoth?</div><div><br></div><div>The mid-section is too open.</div><div><br></div><div>Hangar doors are poorly sized.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall:</div><div>The set is great...if you're a kid. It has plenty of play features and is bound to keep people entertained, yet to the collector, this set can be counted as rubbish. Personally, I adore this set because I love everything Hoth...yet I will admit that it is slightly flawed. If you're looking to recreate a realistic Hoth battle, perhaps you should stick to modding. If you're a collector, definitely pass on this set, as it does not look good on display and really doesn't fit in to what Lego has previously&nbsp;released. If you love Hoth, then I would definitely recommend this set to you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Chills","2012-04-08T20:14:32.693Z","A cool set, but not a fantastic set","<p>I am a huge fan of ESB, and the Hoth battle is my favorite of all the SW movies. So when I was in the Lego Store and I had Hoth Echo Base in one hand and the Millennium Falcon in the other I just had to get the Hoth Base. I'm glad I did, but I wasn't as impressed with the set as I thought I would be.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; ""><br></span></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Pros</span></p>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First off I have to say the mini figures are awesome. You get a couple of snow troopers, a Hoth Han, a Chewie, a red protocol droid, Hoth Leia, and Luke in his skivvies when he was in the bacta tank. All good figures to have in a collection.&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 2: There is some good movie-related detail with this set. I liked the med-center and the control room, both are well done (despite the stickers). I also liked the falling icicles, nice touch.&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 3: The Tauntaun stable is a pretty cool addition, along with a tauntaun.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: With a lot of the recent sets you are really taken back to the movies. But this one really doesn't do that. More than half of the set is nothing like the movies.&nbsp;</li><li>Con 2: The dual radar dishes are my least favorite part of this set. It would have been much cooler to have an sphere that looks like the ion cannon.</li><li>Con 3: The small dish-type gun looks like an afterthought. It doesn't look at all like the dish turret in the movies.&nbsp;</li><li>Con 4: I'm also not a fan of the blue missile launchers. Maybe I'm being too picky but those aren't anywhere in the movies.</li></ul>
<p>I think there is a lot of potential with a set like this, and Lego did alright with it, but not great. But they missed the mark on quite a few things. It would have been cool to have a dish turret that's accurate, an ion cannon instead of the radar-things, and one or two of those tower gun emplacements, as well.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As far as building and pieces, it was a lot of fun; which is why I didn't give it fewer bricks in my rating. The build was cool, lots of little pieces and creativity to make it look snowy and rocky. It also didn't have a bunch of X2 or X3 steps, so the build took some time to finish.</p><p><br></p><p>Hopefully Lego's next iteration of Echo base will pick up where this one left off.</p>",TRUE,3,5,3,4,4
"fatpretzel","2012-07-01T01:17:53.57Z","Designed for playtime, not for accuracy","<p>I was making my weekly tour of stores to find sets on sale when I saw this in Toys R Us for $66.49. I went ahead and picked up two. From the picture on the box, I could see that this is more of a playset designed for kids rather than a display worthy set. So I will try to keep that in mind while I review this set.</p><p><br></p><h4>Box</h4><p>This is a rather large box for the size of the set. &nbsp;At 773 pieces it is a large set, but I think LEGO could have squeezed it into a smaller box. I like that LEGO has put the mini-figures included in the set on top of the box. &nbsp;I think it helps build excitement for collectors and kids alike. There are a lot of features included in this set and the box really shows off all the design elements that went into this set.</p><p><br></p><h4>Instructions</h4><p>There are two 8""x10"" booklets for this set. I didn't find any typos or misprints in either booklet. All the instructions are clear and their are appropriate notices for steps which could be confusing. I like that LEGO has started putting piece lists for every step on all sets, not just TECHNIC or the Ultimate Collector Series sets. Additionally, the parts list in the back of the second book is great. It makes ordering replacement parts much easier.</p><p><br></p><h4>Mini-Figures</h4><p>For collectors, this is the best part of this set. There are eight included with this set, (nine if you include the Tuan-Tuan) and most of them are very good.</p><p></p><ul><li>Han Solo - Han is dressed in his cold-weather gear and has the choice of either his standard hair or a very detailed hood. There is a lot of detail on the torso including Han's macro-binoculars. The legs also include some nice detail showing his holster. This set includes Han's blaster, which I have not seen in any other set.</li><li>Princess Leia - Also dressed in cold-weather gear; Leia gets to hold a&nbsp;Popsicle, (huh?). She has transitioned to the french braid-style hair for this iteration. The head is printed on both sides with standard Leia on one side and angry Leia on the other. (""Why you stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking, nerf-herder!"") The torso also is painted on both sides and white gloves complete the mini-figure.</li><li>Luke Skywalker - This is the best mini-figure in the set as Luke is dressed for his bacta bath. He has a new hairstyle which is much closer to the movie with his fine early 80's feathered hair. The head is also double-printed with a scar and black eye on one side and a sheepish smile on the reverse. (""I just kissed my sister"" maybe?) Kind of a strange expression. I would have gone with a more smug smile to reenact the recovery scene. The torso and legs show a lot of skin. There is a lot of detail on the front and back including the breathing tube. I have to agree with rolandhenry by saying that I would have liked to see a seperate mask rather than painting the head.&nbsp;</li><li>Chewbacca - Along with R2-D2 I believe this comes standard in every set.</li><li>2-1B - Another great addition. The torso is well detailed, however he has the standard droid arms and legs.</li><li>R-3PO - A repaint of C-3PO, (then again aren't all the mini-figures repaints?) this is still a nice mini-figure to add to your collection.</li><li>Snowtrooper x2 - Nice detail on the torso, but I would like to see the cape, (skirt?) included in a future version.</li><li>Taun-Taun - Not technically a mini-figure, but I'll include it anyways. I think this is the only Taun-Taun I have seen in a set. Not a lot of detail, but eyes are painted on and she does have detachable tusks. The saddle and reins are pretty standard.</li></ul><h4>Assembly</h4><p>This set goes together pretty easily. The numbered bags minimizes the number of parts out at any one time. There is one bag that is used in almost all the sections but it contains all of your largest plates. &nbsp;The most complicated portion of the build is the crane/gantry. &nbsp;It does take a little bit of finesse to put it together, but it is still pretty simple. The rest of the set is all stacking. I am not a big fan of stickers on LEGO sets. They tend to yellow if the set is displayed for any length of time and get damaged when the set is disassembled. That being said, I think the clear stickers will last longer, I found that some of the stickers on the angled blocks did not set will and would slide around on the face of the block even when pressed down onto the block. The speeder bike is a new version that uses an ATV body as starting point. It is a little less rugged, but I think it is more accurate looking.</p><h4>Playability</h4><p>If you are a 10 year-old that just got done watching ""The Empire Strikes Back"" for the first time, this will be a great set. There are a lot of play features including the flick-fire missiles, Taun-Taun pen, gantry/crane, rotating radar dishes, falling icicles, command center, weapons magazine and medical center. A kid would have a lot of fun replaying the movie on this set.</p><h4>Displayability</h4><p>Nearly all the detail for this set is on the interior. Fortunately, this set looks best when opened up. Unfortunately, this set measures over 20"" long when opened up. (Longer than some UCS sets) Many of the features included for playability don't really stand up to the accuracy of the movie. The main door is&nbsp;continuously open because the door is missing. The double radar dish should have been replaced with an ion cannon. The crane/gantry is extraneous. The best part of this set is the command and medical centers, with the bacta tank as the best part of this set. I am really impressed with the detail and design that went into this section.&nbsp;</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>This set has a lot of negatives for the collector. I think it is overly priced for what you are getting. It takes up a lot of space and without the bacta tank, it would be&nbsp;indistinguishable from any other ""base"". This set really shines as a toy. There is a lot of features and it will keep kids entertained for hours. The mini-figures are a big plus for both the collector and the kid. My rating is more skewed for the collector and that is why it gets the middle-of-the-road rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,2
"HikerCZ","2013-12-10T15:28:53.58Z","You win some, you lose some","The price of this set in my country made it originally a set I'd had no intention of buying. However, a nice discount 'forced' me to change my mind. It took me some time to get to build the set, not because it is overly complicated, I was rather saving it for a special moment. Building is definitely alright, but it will take some time and there are some stickers. <br><br>First of all, if you haven't made up your mind yet, consider this - it's more fun than a real representation. We can ponder, how many bricks can make a realistically looking base which is virtually a block of ice and rocks but in this case what you get is basically walls and pillars. An elevation or two give this set some height, however, if you want to build your dream-come-true base with a hangar and different sections, you would probably have to buy at least ten such sets. Definitely be ready for some major modding and have white bricks galore. <br><br>What this set fails to achieve on a large scale, it scores big time on a small scale. Lots of SW-related details, like the bacta tank, medical bay, main control room, radar dishes, power generator, gun turrets, gun rack, elevated platform, etc. Fantastic minifigures, some of which are exclusive to this set (and in the future might be sought after by collectors). Although I'm not a fan of the new 'Hot Lips' Leia (I think the thin lips version did more justice to Carrie Fisher), all of the outfits and hair styles are perfect and you even get two brand new droids. Taun Taun has been featured in a number of sets but it's a nice addition anyway. You only get two imperials,&nbsp; unfortunately it's the old version with black heads, so I didn't really mind. <br><br>All in all, this set works in combination with other Hoth-related sets, nevertheless, since the main shield door is missing and not many people actually own the 7666 set, it will not be complete any time soon. On its own it feels a bit patchy but for any keen modder the amount of details outweighs the lack of accuracy and size. The set is honestly not worth its original (European) price but buying in a nice sale certainly adds appeal. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
