Don't know if that is ""normal"" but I didn't complain. The box itself was nicely designed and looked promising. After unboxing it I couldn't agree more! It is very promising.<div><br></div><div><b>The minifigures.</b></div><div>LEGO has really done a nice job with the ewoks included in this set. The paint-job on Logray and Tokkat are just stunning. Very accurate features down to the little bag on Logray's right side. Tokkat looks like a black version of Paploo (Battle of Endor). If LEGO decides to make an ewok village these two would fit right in, and complete such a set. They come with two weapons, a spear and a bow. It would be nice to have had some traditional ewokese weapon perhaps but those included do just fine.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also, there is a biker scout included. It is also very detailed and looks good. If you compare this set to the 2002 release with the same name you perhaps remember that you also got a stormtrooper with it too. Not in this set. To compensate they turned the trooper into a big tree instead! I'd wish there was another imperial soldier with this set though, even if the three minifigures are great nonetheless.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The tree.</b></div><div>This is really no ordinary tree, as it apparently can be found on Endor there is no mistake that it has some ewokese touches! It has no less than 4 traps/weapons attached to it apart from a hollow tree feature (open up and place an ewok inside). It's a really dangerous tree if you are on the wrong side of the fight. Not only that, but the ewoks have weapons too, as said above.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>- Catapult. There's a small catapult on the treetop that fires very well.</div><div>- Logs. One of the traps release two logs on bypassers below.</div><div>- Long branch knock-out.

"captain_radda_radda","2011-08-16T21:23:51.333Z","A Major Disappointment","<p>To start off I am not a fan of Ewoks. The only reason I bought this set was for the speeder. That being said, I already had a poor, yet optimistic attidude when buying this set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Minifigs</p>
<p>The minifigs are superb. They should definitely be the driving factor when considering to buy this set, as each is unique and rather rare. (The Endor Bunker is harder to find now) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Set</p>
<p>The tree fort is, well...a hot mess. Branches are placed randomly and the area wear the Ewoks attack is cramped. The flick missle is useless and the head-rammer-log-thing in the center is ineffective and utterly unusable. The log drop feature works and is really the only feature that makes sense and is fun to play around with. The minicatapault is really nothing special, but it works and actually fits in to the set. The Speeder is great and its always nice to have an extra Scout. The changes in the speeder are actually rather useful, since the prongs in the front are now held together and aren't easily broken off. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall</p>
<p>The finished product is really just a jumbled up mess of brown bricks. It starts to look like a tree from the ground up, but eventually evolves into some kind of flatened sand surface that somehow has branches on it. Also, it is very, very small. However, I must say that it looks somewhat more presentable when combined with the Endor Battle Bunker. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get it if:</p>
<p>You really like Ewoks</p>
<p>You need a Scout/Speeder</p>
<p>You like trees</p>

"Orthobotrex","2011-07-26T05:36:57.27Z","Low tech meets high tech","<p>This is a relatively small OT set. It features three minifigs, a speeder bike and a tree base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Package</strong></p>
<p>All the parts come in polybags, though the manual is still laid bare inside, so you might find folds and bends. The box is relatively large to what you'll assemble from the contents, in my opinion. The ewok heads are packed separately inside the polybags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Minifigs</strong></p>
<p>The new ewok characters are rendered in great detail, especially Logray's head ornaments. They come with their individual weapons. And they are cute, as usual. The scout trooper has the usual black head with the helmet and the usual torso prints.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speeder Bike</strong></p>
<p>This speeder bike is many ways similar to the the one in the snow trooper battle pack though it is quite longer. The rear is extended a bit, which in my opinion is unnecessary, giving it a bare area.<br>The main body has the same features as the newer speeders. The area over the control levers may be quite a disappointment&nbsp;as the build gives it only a very narrow space to tilt sideways. The plate with the axle jams against the loudhailer when turning it to the right. The rest of the build is smooth sailing. It has a very good swoosh factor as the other<br>speeders in its league.</p>
<p><strong>The Ewok Base</strong></p>
<p>This part of the build is quite fun but I guess is generally aimed at children. Constructing the&nbsp; compartments gives a good insight into how to add volume in a relatively small area.</p>
<p>It is also rigged with a lot of familiar and well placed booby traps and other weapons. You have a sliding wood plank to stop any trooper caught unaware. There is also a hatch where&nbsp;Tokkat&nbsp; can appear out of nowhere and hit with his arrow. Logray&nbsp;mans the upper portion where you have the falling logs and the rotating catapult. If there were any additional parts for tree building, one could easily build a very nice tree house. The ladder gives it a sense of accessibility.</p>
<p>And, of course, there is the flick-fire missile ...why must it be there? why? This is an excess on its own, in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The placement and (ultimately) the sparsity of the foliage would add more to the feeling of a good tree base with adequate cover and would somehow make up for the use of the BURP. Seriously, I think a few more stems and leaves won't hurt (maybe only our pockets).</p>
<p>As I don't like the somewhat limited excursion of the speeder's sideways motion at the controls, I exchanged the places of the 1x1 round plates at a lower location and the 1x2 plate with a vertical bar in a similar fashion as the snowspeeders, giving it a sense of better maneuverability without taking out or adding parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Extra parts</strong></p>
<p>You get an extra droid arm, two technic pins, a 1x1 round plate, and a &nbsp;1x2 plate, among others.</p>
<p>Overall, it is a relatively fun build (though somewhat juvenile) and the minifigs are a great addition to anyone's collection.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is just the usual Star wars box and instructions(I don;t now if it's just me,but the instructions are hard to read since there are a lot of brown pieces)</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Mainly brown pieces and tree leafs.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The minifigs are pretty good since you get a brand new logray and tokkat minifigs&nbsp;with new details and face features and a rare scout trooper.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>Nothing special;not at all challenging</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Really small,in fact smaller than youd think for a set thats $25,but at least it comes with a speeder bike that is somewhat similar to the 2009 ones.(I dislike the way how they keep changing it)</p>

	Ewok...<b><i>ATTACK!</i></b>&nbsp; That was not just a tree. &nbsp;It was an ewok hideout! &nbsp;Check out all these awesome features that belong to the ewok attack!</p>
<p>
	<i style=""font-weight: bold; "">BUILDING EXPERIENCE: </i><span style=""font-weight: bold; ""><i>4 BRICKS -&nbsp;</i></span>I rated this building experience a four because it was sort of short. &nbsp;Building too fast means less enjoyment. &nbsp;I think building is one of the best parts of having a&nbsp;Lego set. &nbsp;I still gave it a four, though, because it was fun to build all the weapons! &nbsp;I also loved building the secret door which one of the ewoks can hide in at a time. &nbsp;I&nbsp;also&nbsp;loved the flick&nbsp;missile, the catapult, and the logs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<b><i>PARTS: 5 BRICKS -&nbsp;</i></b>I rated parts five bricks because this set has all types of cool stuff! &nbsp;I especially loved the catapult piece because its very unique. &nbsp;You don&#39;t find those in every set! &nbsp;I also loved the door piece. &nbsp;Those are a little more common than the catapult pieces, but they are fairly uncommon as well. &nbsp;Logray&#39;s bow is also a nice piece. &nbsp;A few more pieces I liked were the tree&#39;s leaves and Tokkat&#39;s spear.</p>
<p>
	<b><i>PLAYABILITY:</i></b>&nbsp;<b><i>5 BRICKS -&nbsp;</i></b>Perhaps the best part of this set is the playability. &nbsp;The catapult launches really far if you don&#39;t point it at yourself like I did once. &nbsp;Your sure to find out when you launch it. &nbsp;The log that goes through the middle does best when you flick it on one end. &nbsp;You can also release the two logs on the top by pulling the little handle back. &nbsp;Most people know you have to flick the missile. &nbsp;Just open the hideout door located under the ladder and flick that missile. &nbsp;Also you can fit one ewok in the hideout door. &nbsp;This set&#39;s playability is<i>&nbsp;<b>AWESOME!</b></i><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>
	<b><i>OVERALL RATING: 4 BRICKS -&nbsp;</i></b>The reason why I gave this four stars was because I think the building experience was more of a low four stars. &nbsp;I have back up for anything else in the information above. &nbsp;I hope you enjoyed the review!</p>

"Huge_Nerd","2011-11-12T08:25:06.26Z","Return of Castle Forestmen--er, Ewoks!","I've been wanting this set for some time and I finally got it with a coupon at TRU. I, personally, was not let down. <br><br>Let me say, right off the bat, as the previous reviewer mentioned, this set is very reminiscent of the Castle Forestmen sets of the 80s--from the minifig weapons, to the parts used in building the tree, the build itself, the way the tree opens up, etc. For me, though, that was a big plus. I felt very nostalgic building it.<br><br>The tree-fort is very fun. The little catapult works nice as does the log-dropping device. I personally like the ""clothesline"" branch trap the best--it's fun to hang the scout trooper bent over it as his bike goes off without him. The flickfire is a bit tacked on, but I always enjoy flickfire--plus it serves as a weapon rack for the bow so Tokkat can fit inside the tree.<br><br>The speeder bike is pretty standard, but they are always fun to have.<br><br>The Ewok minifigs are incredibly detailed. Logray was always a favorite as a kid so I was excited to get a Lego version of him. His churi-bird skull, pouch, and spear--as well as his extra height--all fit the character perfectly. I was less familiar with Tokkat, but his black and green color scheme make him perfect for hiding in the shadows of the tree. The scout trooper was a little disappointing. With no back or helmet printing, he seems very plain compared to standard Stormtroopers. That being said, he's the perfect foil for the Ewoks to beat up on.<br><br>The MSRP price is pretty fair given all the playability, but as always, discounts are better!<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"AETerry","2011-09-10T18:52:36.733Z","Ewok Attack Review","I find myself disappointed with this set. Starting off when I saw it on the shelf, I got all excited for Ewoks! A new speeder bike design! Return of the Jedi and a set depicting some of my favorite scenes in the Original Trilogy. You've got Logray as a minifigure and another ewok, Tokkat. The box art made it really look exciting.<br><br>One of the problems I have with the set, is after you've got it all put together, it's smaller then expected and thus giving a feeling that this is about $5 too much. Unless you're counting the Star Wars label, $3 for minifigures and about $16 for the piece count. Then that might all work out.<br><br>I will start with the speeder bike. This was fairly quick and easy with a new design/build for the speeder bike that makes the other two models I've got, look primitive. The body for the tri-wheeler motorcycles is used as the base for the speeder bike and the end result is just far better then older models. There are new element pieces this time around since the old bikes of 10 years ago. Meaning there's just better ways to build and create the speeder that couldn't be done before and this one I'd love to see a smaller set of just the speeder bike made available so more of this newer model can be made.<br><br>It's the tree build where I am marking points down at for this set. You really do start off with a great base for the tree and pieces for making it. The problems that I get from this set are the little flick missile weapon in the trunk of the tree. You're supposed to be able to open the&nbsp; trunk on it's hinges to get to this missile. <br><br>Now I can see where LEGO might intend the smaller hands of a child to be able to reach this weapon. Being a woman and having small hands myself; having a fairly delicate touch, I'm not a fumble fingers and I'm able to often times get into the small places to do any delicate work and handling of LEGO pieces - I do not -see- how a child is suppose to get their fingers inside the trunk and be able to use the flick weapon. It's impossible to get hands or even fingers in there to fire it.<br><br>You get to the top of the tree build and it just becomes flat and there's hardly any more tree build coming out. Yeah. The small tiny catapult kind of works, but it's also placed on the set blocking the ladder up. And the log trap kind of works too, but isn't all that exciting. Plus there's a piece that slides on the trunk that I don't see what that's used for or it's purpose.<br><br>There was just huge amount of potential with this set for part of the forest battle between the Ewoks and Empire and it fails, falling flat. I love it for Logray, Tokkat and being able to have more ewoks. And I love the new speeder bike model.<br><br>Find the set on sale at $20 or less. Obviously if you're a fan of Ewoks, Speeder Bikes, any of the Return of the Jedi Endor sets, this set is a must for the collection.<br>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,3
"bod3","2011-12-28T07:07:03.93Z","A great LEGO set (BUT ONLY IF YOU DON'T PAY £26 FOR IT!)","<p>
 I recived this set for Christmas, and I was quite impressed with it, however&nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t pay &pound;26 for it as&nbsp; this is a complete rip-off! My parents payed &pound;16 for it, (on Amazon)&nbsp;which is a decent price, and&nbsp;&pound;16&nbsp;should really be the RRP. It comes with 3 mini figs (Tokkat, Logray and a scout trooper) the main part of the set is a tree containing lots of nice features, such as a catapult and a tree branch which can be pushed through the tree to knock the scout trooper of the speeder bike. The speeder bike itself is nothing special and the tree is a bit unrealistic but they work well together and i think LEGO haven&#39;t done a bad job with this set.</p>

"Holton","2011-10-09T22:28:38.193Z","It's a (very playable) tree.","<p>I was not originally going to buy this model but a budget restriction (aka 'my wife') meant that it was either this or the Sith Nightspeeder (7957).&nbsp; As a fan of the original trilogy first-and-foremost it was not really a choice.&nbsp; In addition, I have been wanting to get my hands on a scout trooper to add to my Imperial army for some time now. <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box was, as ever, attractive and gives accurate demonstrations of all the trap gimmicks on the back.&nbsp; Again, it has the clone trooper header though which just looks out of place on a Classic Star Wars themed set.</p><p>Instructions were clear for the most part.&nbsp; It is split into just two builds - the speeder bike and the tree.&nbsp; I did have some trouble, however, discerning between the lighter and darker shades of brown so I would recommend a well-lit build space.&nbsp; The blending of browns and the viewpoint used in the instructions also made it a little difficult to see exactly where to place some pieces.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Nothing to get excited about here, really.&nbsp; As I only build the Star Wars models now, it was nice to see some foliage again.&nbsp; There are about three small Technic's parts for the catapult which I wish they could have avoided (and I also think look out of place on the final model).<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I actually found the Ewoks to be surprisingly well detailed.</p><p>Logray's headpiece is excellent, with sculpted skull and tassels.&nbsp; He also has a sculpted shoulder bag which was a nice touch.&nbsp; I wish they could have done something about creating a real (more movie-accurate) staff for him, rather than using the standard spear but it's a small point.</p><p>Tokkat's headpiece is also detailed but with the details printed on rather than sculpted.&nbsp; A small point to mention, and probably not important to most, is that he is not movie-accurate.&nbsp; Tokkat originally had dark brown fur, with a lighter brown nose and hands whereas this figure is mostly black.</p><p>And finally, the scout trooper.&nbsp; It is strange that the minifigure I wanted most is perhaps the most disappointing.&nbsp; This is essentially the same figure they have been producing since the 1999 set 'Speeder Bikes' (7128), albeit with a different head (that you will never see).&nbsp; Standing next to the detailed stormtroopers, snowtroopers and new Imperial pilots, this minifigure just looks bare.&nbsp; No printing on the helmet and no back print.&nbsp; I was also not happy with his blaster as he should have had a smaller pistol (like the ones you get with the clone commanders).&nbsp; He really needs an update.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I actually enjoyed the build but it was quite easy and just took an hour (in front of the TV).</p><p>The speeder bike was simple and should be familiar to anyone who has built one since 2009.</p><p>The tree was actually quite engaging - straightforward, but it was nice to see it shape-up.&nbsp; I made a few minor placement errors due to misreading the instructions (see above for the reasons) but they were easily spotted and quick to alter.</p><h4>The completed model</h4><p>The speeder bike is excellent, as I knew it would having built similar ones before.&nbsp; I actually like the extended plate at the back as it lets you place another figure there (re-creating some scenes from the movie) and still have some detail on the rear.</p><p>To me the tree also looks quite good.&nbsp; It looks like a tree that has been altered to ambush people.&nbsp; The traps, for the most part, work well and I felt there was plenty of room to place the Ewok minifigures.&nbsp; I was particularly impressed with the falling-log trap and had great fun knocking my stormtroopers over with it.&nbsp; The sliding log also works a treat for smashing Imperials right in the head.</p><p>There were some concerns:</p><p>The flick-fire missile (as most people have mentioned) is useless as a missile.&nbsp; It does make a nice decorative branch, however.</p><p>The catapult was the opposite, with the small bricks flying for miles (and nearly getting lost).</p><p>I personally cannot fit Tokkat in the hiding space holding his bow and arrow (as it shows on the box).&nbsp; I have to remove the bow and hang it on the flick-fire missile (see - another use for it) before I can fully close the compartment.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this set would definitely appeal to anyone who wants to play with it.&nbsp; I was amazed with the amount of playable gimmicks it has for a smaller model.&nbsp; It also includes just enough minifigures to let it standalone.&nbsp; <br></p><p>At the end of the day, though, the main model is just a tree.&nbsp; There is nothing about it that says 'Star Wars' and it could easily have come from one of the 'Castle' sets I used to play with back in the Eighties.&nbsp; I feel this might be a major problem for some people - particularly those who want to place it on a shelf.<br></p><p>That said, the speeder and the minifigures may persuade you otherwise.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,3

As with other figures with short legs, the ewoks have the unfortunate downside of limited ""posability"" - you can't move the legs. Combine this with an unmovable head, and the only thing you CAN move on the ewoks are the arms and hands.</p><p>The Imperial Trooper is nicely enough made. But I do wish they would've added an additional normal stormtrooper as well, especially given the normal retail price of the set and the fact that the speeder can hold two minifigs.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was easy and uncomplicated, as mentioned above about the instructions. It's really best to have some free space for building the set though, as the bags aren't numbered and different parts for the same stage of the build can all come from different bags, so it's easiest if you can spread them all for an easier time finding the correct parts.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The speeder bike is nice, even if nothing entirely new or spectacular (except for me in the sense that it was my first). The ""tree hideout"" of the ewoks is a bit cramped, especially the interior, but has a nice set of traps for the poor scout - an extensible plank, a falling log trap, a flick-fire spear (or whatever it is) and even a small catapult. So, that's plenty for a set this small, and good for playability, although the catapult and flick-fire spear can be a bit tricky to use.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall a nice set, but overpriced at regular retail price.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
"Marorsharpe","2013-04-08T11:23:43.16Z","An fun build that is marred by the price","<p>This kit first off is very nicely done, I enjoyed constructing it due to the fact that there is very little repetition, which can be frustrating and spoil the fun. Lots of nice little play features for you to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The Ewok's and scout trooper are great little mini figures!</li><li>Lots of projectiles&nbsp;</li><li>A fun build that isn't repetitive</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The biggest issue is its cost. If you can get it on a deal, do.</li><li>It's a shame the smaller mini figures lack some pose ability&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>All in all a good set, worth getting for the speeder bike! It's very nice. Just expensive&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-10-24T08:32:12.25Z","A great addition to your Endor collection ","<p>So I recently purchased <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10236-1/Ewok-Village"">10236 Ewok Village </a>and decided that I needed to get the rest of the Endor sets. There aren&#39;t too many Endor sets out there and they all date back to shortly before the village was released. <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8038-1/The-Battle-of-Endor"">8038 Battle for Endor</a> is the oldest of these sets and this set is a perfect compliment to that set as it contains a crucial play feature. Where Battle for Endor gave you a AT-ST, it didn&#39;t really give you anything to attack it with, aside from a hang glider that drops rocks. The Ewok Village gave us logs that smash either side of it, but this set gives you logs that can be rolled in front of it to trip it up. It&#39;s a strange play feature to include in a set that only has a speeder bike as it requires an AT-ST to be put to use, but it is an important part of the Battle for Endor. Now onto the review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>So you get a biker scout to ride the speeder bike, and there is no question that he is an important minifigure to include in this set. However, it is the Ewoks that make this set exciting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Logray is also included in the Ewok Village but he was first introduced in this set and looks fantastic with his satchel. Of course having duplicate Ewok minifigures isn&#39;t a huge problem as you will probably want to get many of them to build up your army.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tokkat on the other hand is unique to this set, so if you are trying to complete your Ewok collection this set is crucial. The minifigure looks fantastic as the dark green hood really compliments his dark fur quite nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Speeder Bike</p>

<p>The speeder bike is slightly different from the ones that appear in the other Endor sets, however the overall design remains unchanged. Even though I have three different designs between this set, Battle for Endor, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9489-1/Endor-Rebel-Trooper-Imperial-Trooper-Battle-Pack"">9489 Battle Pack,</a> they are all similar enough that they look fine together. Of the three designs I think that this one happens to be my favorite and therefore I pieced together two additional ones on Bricklink. The newest iteration in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75238-1/Action-Battle-Endor-Assault"">75238 Action Battle</a> eliminated the unique bike mold so it doesn&#39;t fit in well with these designs, that one is also my son&#39;s so I don&#39;t have it with my Endor collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Tree</p>

<p>This is the main build for this set and is a very interesting build for a Star Wars set as trees are typically not something you see too often. That said, it is very small and certainly out of scale when compared to Battle for Endor or Ewok Village. That said it&#39;s girth isn&#39;t too much of a problem, but it&#39;s height is. I suppose you could argue the Ewoks cut down this tree to construct a fortification. Like most vegetation builds, it is pretty random but is really nothing more than simple stacking. Probably the best thing about it is it has plenty of plant bricks, and they come in two shades of green.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tree also has a handful of play features. The most important and best feature is the rolling logs. There is a lever on the top that when opened releases two logs and it works great. My only complaint is that there is nothing designed to hold the logs in place on either side of them, only the lever on the top. As a result if you pick up the set, there is a very good chance you will drop the logs thru either side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another play feature is that a quarter of the tree opens up to reveal a hiding place for an Ewok. Nothing too exciting, but not a bad idea as the Ewoks did hide. You get a small catapult that isn&#39;t anything special. You also get a sliding I don&#39;t know what and I don&#39;t know why. All I can figure out is that it lifts the ladder off the ground a bit so that a short Ewok may have trouble climbing it, but a stormtrooper won&#39;t even notice it&#39;s off the ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>The set isn&#39;t perfect, but it also isn&#39;t bad. The most important reason to get it is for Tokkat, but also the rolling logs are important as well. If you can find it cheap I highly recommend it. However, its original price is absurdly high for how small a set it is, and now it can be difficult not to have to pay a premium for it on the second hand market. Then again, there are only 4 sets from this time period depicting Endor, so if you&#39;ve already spent the big bucks on the Ewok Village and Battle for Endor, dropping a few more bucks on this set isn&#39;t all that big of a deal. Think of it as a way to build up your Ewok army and get another speeder bike.&nbsp;</p>
