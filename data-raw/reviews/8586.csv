<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key reason for driving me to buy this set is Asajj Ventress, a few weeks ago I noticed that the prize of the version of this minifig from 7676 is very high at around USD30! And in fact 7676 was the only set with Ventress before 7957 comes out, the 7676 version contains a skirt cloth but this 7957 version in my opionion has a more combat feel (or sports feel) and looks slimmer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other minifig Savage Opress&nbsp;is the other lego minifig with a horned head aside from Darth Maul in 7961, and Anakin Skywalker also got a new and IMHO better torso pattern, besides, all the minifigs has back printing, so this set does contain very special minifig inventory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the vehicle is also very nice, usually Lego speeders are very simple but this set provides a sophisticated combo night speeder system with a base and engine on the left, and two speeders that can be detached, and can be connected to the base with a bar stick. The vehicle has good swooshability, I am not very fond of missiles but playing with the speeders is quite fun enough for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two speeders are very sleek, building the set is fun and the techniques are inspiring, but the biggest surprise is the six printed slope bricks, which are used for the front, it is interesting that Lego designed this to be a combo of printed and stickered slopes, and perhaps it is the printed slopes that makes this set relatively pricey, and if the back slopes are also printed, the price could go so high that the set will sell badly if they do so, therefore Lego have to take a Balance, but on the other hand, if the set uses all printed parts, it would probably make the set so special and become a hot collector item, though Lego needs to be careful about the message to the market, but after all, this is an interesting set and the Lego decision for including the six printed slope bricks can be very interesting too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is a must buy despite the relatively higher price for its size, but for the price range, it is a light investment to get a set that includes exclusive cool minifigs and an unique vehicle with special design, not to mention the unusual inventory of six printed slope bricks with nice pattern, this is a special Lego Starwar set to collect.</p>

"captain_radda_radda","2011-09-20T00:26:52.807Z","Solely for the Minifigs","So I bought this set for one reason: Savage Opress. The fig looked fantastic in pictures and is definitely an awesome addition to the growing list of baddies. So basically lets get this out of the way: the fig is amazing. It has a fully printed torso with yellow tattoos and a great face. The armor is from the Hockey player&nbsp;collectible&nbsp;minifigure and is printed on both sides. The horns are my biggest complaint, as they are not coherent with the rest of the coloring of Savage...which throws off the&nbsp;consistency. Also, and this is just my opinion, Savage looks&nbsp;awkward&nbsp;with the armor. He looks too bulky given the fact that his head printing is narrow and the armor makes his head look tiny. Keep the armor off for maximum awesomeness. Ventress is improved, as she does not look chubby like the version from the Republic Gunship. She looks deadly and lean but I recommend adding a black hood to make her look like the hardcore assassin from the show. Seriously, just throw the other Ventress away, as this version is lightyears better than the other version. Surprisingly, Anakin is the incredible. His tunic is improved and looks detailed and finished without the stupid black clone armor around the neck and chest. He looks great. I actually wish they would have included this version in ever Anakin set ever, as it really is THAT much better. The speeders on the set are cool and they have excellent swooshability. Yet I don't understand the set. I haven't seen the episode in which this is featured yet, so I really don't know what the heck this thing is. I like it for its uniqueness...but I can't compare it to the show or any other vehicle I've seen.<div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div>Minifigs</div><div>Speeders</div><div>Printed elements</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div>Bulky armor</div><div><br></div><div>Overall:</div><div>Buy this set for the minifigs. Seriously its worth the price alone as every one of these figures is phenomenal.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"Firox_5000","2012-01-21T15:24:14.093Z","Anakin vs the speeder","<p>I bought this set on amazon for a reduced retail price. The set contains 213 pieces and takes around 20-25 minutes to build. </p>
<p>The model includes 3 figures, the first one is Asajj Ventress who is a figure who has not appeared in star wars since the Republix gun ship [ a set I missed out on] as well as Anakin skywalker who other than a couple of minor treaks is very much the same as older editions and nothing special. The main attracting figure though in the set has to be Savage Opress who has an awesome hair piece, armour and face as well a double lightsaber [ as he is a relitive of darth maul]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The speeder itself has some rather nice colour detail. Unfortunately this is all done by stickers. The set however is quite sturdy and good for playability. Other than the stickers, there is not a great amount of detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;While the sets presentation&nbsp;is &nbsp;rather simple, the model makes up in play value where the two seats on the speeder can seperate to become smaller speeders as well as the infamous flick fire missles [ which seem to recieve a marmite response by fans]. The playability in this set is excellent and could keep any fan young or old entertained and unlike most star wars sets does not need another set of the setting to sufficiently increase play value. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the value of the set for £26, the set is rather small and expense and although it is licensed lego/star wars [ which almost always gets a price hike], the set is overpriced and should really have a rrp of £20.99. However the price I bought it at being £17.79, the value is not bad and probably the price you would pay for this set if it wasn't licensed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend this set to any one who is interested in cw figures, savagge opress, any one interested in a set thats cheap but has good playability and any one who is a hardcore fan of star wars. </p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"plantman","2012-09-08T02:50:05.83Z","This vehicle is just plain stupid - but you get sith Savage Opress and Asajj","<p>I will start with the good pionts on this one:&nbsp;you get Savage Opress, not available in any other set, and Asajj Ventress - appears in another set, but has a different color scheme here.&nbsp; You also get yet another Anakin, but chances are you already have at least one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On to the vehicle.&nbsp; It is a two-seat speeder of some sort.&nbsp; Most vehicle make some sense in the Star Wars universe (if you overlook wings in space).&nbsp; This one just looks silly and impractical.&nbsp; If it weren't for the figures in this set, it would have been a deffinite pass for me.&nbsp; This set also has a gratuitous use of stickers for its size.&nbsp; I am not a fan of stickers - I have had too many start to peel while just sitting on display.&nbsp; Buy for the figures, or if you are a huge Clone Wars fan you might like the ship.&nbsp; It just wasn't a Star Wars set I enjoy.</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,5,4
