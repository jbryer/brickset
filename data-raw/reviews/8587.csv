<p>Okay, wow.&nbsp; It has been quite a while since my last review.&nbsp; Anyways, this is a fabulous set.&nbsp; I picked it up at the&nbsp;Mall of America yesterday, and (despite its model-a-day setup) I built every one of the models.&nbsp; For those of you who do not want to know what the models are, skip to the bottom of the review, where you will find a review of the non-secretive aspects of this set.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of you who really don't care about the models staying a secret, I will detail each of the days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SPOILER ALERT!&nbsp; DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT IF SUPRISE IS EVERYTHING!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong>- Mini Republic Cruiser- As seen in <em>The Phantom Menace</em>.&nbsp; That bright red ship in the beginning of the first movie that made a awesome target for a&nbsp;Separatist laser cannon.&nbsp; It makes a great mini.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;2</strong>- Nute Gunray- Pretty rare&nbsp;minifigure.&nbsp; Only available in this set and the Separatist&nbsp;Shuttle.&nbsp; Love the&nbsp;hat :-D.&nbsp; <em>The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones,&nbsp;</em>and <em>Revenge of the Sith&nbsp;</em>is where you&nbsp;can see this guy.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;3</strong>- Um...Half a four-legged&nbsp;destroyer droid?&nbsp; No, I am fairly&nbsp;certain that this is the walking chair for&nbsp;Nute Gunray, as seen&nbsp;in <em>The&nbsp;Phantom Menace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I wish&nbsp;it was&nbsp;the Lego&nbsp;chair piece, instead of the 2x2 round piece.&nbsp; Oh well.<em>&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;4</strong>-&nbsp;Mini Homing Spider Droid-&nbsp;Another&nbsp;decent mini.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to take a&nbsp;second look at it&nbsp;to make sure it was the Homing Spider&nbsp;Droid, as seen in <em>Attack&nbsp;of the Clones</em>, probably <em>The&nbsp;Clone Wars&nbsp;</em>(I don't know, I have only seen&nbsp;the movie, and part of a couple episodes), and,&nbsp;correct me if I am wrong, <em>Revenge of&nbsp;the Sith</em>.&nbsp; Great mini, not one of my favorites, though.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;5</strong>- One of my two favorites,&nbsp;the mini&nbsp;<em>Slave I</em>.&nbsp; I know,&nbsp; I know, its so unoriginal.&nbsp; How many mini versions of this ship have been made?&nbsp; Three?&nbsp; But, it is Boba Fett's ship.&nbsp; Of course its awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>,&nbsp;and<em> Return of the Jedi </em>for you non-Star Wars&nbsp;fans.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day 6</strong>- Chewie!&nbsp; Not too much more to say.&nbsp; Hard&nbsp;to find in sets under 50 USD.&nbsp; He stars in&nbsp;<em>Revenge of the Sith, A&nbsp;New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back</em>,&nbsp;and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Great to have another ""walking carpet."" :-D&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day 7</strong>-&nbsp;A tool barrel holding a wrench and hammer, and a&nbsp;sideways clip holding a crossbow.&nbsp; I can only assume the crossbow is for&nbsp;Chewie.&nbsp; Not black as pictured&nbsp;on the box.&nbsp; A&nbsp;chrome, similar to the Kingdoms' weapons and helmets.&nbsp; A nice little extra that is not in any movie I&nbsp;know of (Star Wars or otherwise).&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;8</strong>- A&nbsp;Rebel Alliance&nbsp;pilot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Identical to&nbsp;Zev Senesca, but with no markings on the helmet.&nbsp; Just plain white.&nbsp; All right!&nbsp; A ""new"" pilot other than the named ones.&nbsp; Pilots like this one are commonly seen&nbsp;in <em>A New Hope,&nbsp;The Empire Strikes Back</em>,&nbsp;and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;9</strong>- Probably the&nbsp;largest of the minis (wow, wasn't that helpful?) the X-wing Fighter.&nbsp;Pretty good mini, but I can't help feel that the other mini versions&nbsp;may be better (I don't know, this is my only mini X-wing).&nbsp; Ditto to the movies listed&nbsp;under&nbsp;day&nbsp;8.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;10</strong>-&nbsp;Mini Imperial Shuttle- A nice little shuttle.&nbsp; From the front and back it looks great.&nbsp; Side view, not so much.&nbsp; <em>Return of the Jedi </em>was where this craft was commonly seen.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;11</strong>- Pilot Battle Droid- Blue-torso with some&nbsp;beige markings.&nbsp; For a Battle&nbsp;Droid, not bad.&nbsp; Includes a blaster, which is a plus.&nbsp; These droids were given fleeting glimpses in <em>The Phantom&nbsp;Menace, Attack of the Clones</em>,&nbsp;and <em>Revenge of the Sith, </em>and, I am only guessing, <em>The Clone Wars</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;12</strong>- Snow Speeder- Not as good&nbsp;as the one in the mini AT-ST and Snow Speeder combo&nbsp;from way back when.&nbsp; The wings are not sloped at all, giving it a&nbsp;not-quite-right shape.&nbsp; Still not&nbsp;bad, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave pilots flew these in <em>The Empire Strikes&nbsp;Back </em>against the Imperial AT-ATs.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;13</strong>- A black astromech&nbsp;droid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Very rare.&nbsp; This guy is great to have for any ship with an astromech droid socket.&nbsp; I cannot remember any specific movie&nbsp;scene with a droid like this,&nbsp;but&nbsp;there probably&nbsp;is one like this somewhere in the series.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;14</strong>- Mouse Droid- This little&nbsp;one&nbsp;appears in the&nbsp;a couple of sets, but&nbsp;I know that at least in&nbsp;the<em>&nbsp;Star Destroyer </em>set the colors were slightly different.&nbsp; Either way, not&nbsp;a bad little&nbsp;droid.&nbsp; Episodes IV, V, VI are the episodes&nbsp;that&nbsp;one can see&nbsp;a droid like&nbsp;this.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;15</strong>- My other favorite mini:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini Republic Gunship.&nbsp; Nicely made, with&nbsp;great building techniques.&nbsp; It looks&nbsp;spot on.<em>&nbsp; Attack of the Clones,&nbsp;Revenge of the Sith</em>, and <em>The Clone Wars </em>are where one can commonly see these amazing&nbsp;Republic ships.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;16- </strong>Clone Pilot- Standard <em>Clone Wars </em>pilot.&nbsp; One oddity:&nbsp; His head is solid black,&nbsp;like many&nbsp;Stormtroopers, and&nbsp;Episode II and&nbsp;III&nbsp;Clones.&nbsp; Not bad.&nbsp; I love sets with&nbsp;Clones, especially when they have color!&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;17-&nbsp;</strong>Weapons&nbsp;holder.&nbsp; The weapons that are available a green lightsaber, two&nbsp;middle-sized blasters, and electrobinoculars.&nbsp; Again, not specific to a movie, but&nbsp;certainly welcome.&nbsp; No Star Wars Clone or Droid shall go unarmed!&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;18</strong>- Mini Y-wing-&nbsp;I cannot be sure as to whether this&nbsp;is a Classic trilogy (episodes IV, V, VI) or <em>Clone Wars </em>Y-wing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, it is a great mini.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;19- </strong>TIE pilot- A great minifig that can be found&nbsp;in the <em>TIE Interceptor</em> set.&nbsp; The newer helmet is nice, though perhaps a little bulky.&nbsp;&nbsp;Episodes IV, V, and&nbsp;VI are where&nbsp;these guys can be seen&nbsp;as they seek to&nbsp;destroy the Rebel Alliance.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;20</strong>- Mini TIE Fighter- Probably my least&nbsp;favorite of the minis.&nbsp; It is a simple set made&nbsp;up of 7 pieces.&nbsp; The way&nbsp;it looks is fine, but in some ways, it just strikes me as a little too simple.&nbsp;Episodes IV, V,&nbsp;and&nbsp;VI are where these ships can be seen exploding.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;21</strong>-&nbsp;Mini Millennium Falcon- A nice, compact design.&nbsp;However, my&nbsp;main complaint would be the lack of&nbsp;a printed dish.&nbsp; This probably&nbsp;would have&nbsp;catapulted&nbsp;it to be my top favorite.&nbsp; As it is, it is average.&nbsp; Need I say what&nbsp;episodes it is in? (To you&nbsp;new fans episodes&nbsp;IV, V, VI).&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;22-&nbsp;</strong>Mini A-wing- Interesting in its&nbsp;design.&nbsp; Average.&nbsp; Because of the&nbsp;original design of the ship, there is not too much to say<em>.&nbsp; Return of the Jedi </em>is where this ship is highlighted.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;23- </strong>In a galaxy far, far away we have... A&nbsp;Christmas tree?&nbsp; Oh, that's right.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an Advent&nbsp;set.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Christmas tree is a good design.&nbsp; I am looking forward to&nbsp;putting it on my&nbsp;Star Wars shelf and having friends ask about the random&nbsp;Christmas tree.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Day&nbsp;24</strong>- So,&nbsp;who brings gifts to all of the good little children?&nbsp; Well...Yoda...Claus.&nbsp; When my sister saw this figure, that is what she dubbed it.&nbsp; Yoda Claus is a wonderful figure, with a&nbsp;2011 backpack (seen in many of the City sets) with gifts tucked inside.&nbsp; He also includes his&nbsp;standard walking stick.&nbsp; Seeing&nbsp;Yoda dressed in red, with a candy cane&nbsp;tucked in his belt, brings a whole new dimension to Star Wars.&nbsp; You won't see this in a movie, folks!&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ALL RIGHT, SPOILER&nbsp;REPORT IS OVER!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well that review was a lot longer than I anticipated.&nbsp; For those of you who who did not read the spoiler report, I salute you.&nbsp; For those of you&nbsp;who did, I would have too :-D.&nbsp; As to the other, not-so-secret aspects of this set.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Box</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The box is as pictured here on Brickset, however, my box features a string of Christmas lights between the&nbsp;Captain Rex and the pictures of&nbsp;some of the&nbsp;Lego surprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Instructions</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instructions for this unusual set are printed on the inside flaps of each&nbsp;individual box.&nbsp;&nbsp;One picture each, which for some of the models could prove a challenge for younger children.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this Star Wars set does not show the true meaning of Christmas,&nbsp;it is a great set with great pieces and figures.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;well-worth the money.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

"tkettle9719","2011-12-28T11:14:58.97Z","Intergalactic Holiday!","<p>I got this set after the break started for children in school, and thus I built almost the entire collection in an hour. This set has many pros (absolutely perfect models) and many cons (imperfect sets) that I will tell you about. Spoiler Alert on...NOW!<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-Republic Cruiser (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Phantom Menace</span>)-This set has a great design for only 20 pieces. <br></li><li>-Nute Gunray (Prequel Trilogy)- Although it is ugly and non-Christmas, it is a very nice minifig.</li><li>-Homing Spider Droid (Clone Wars Era)- This model is superb in only 20 pieces, and has a spinning gun.</li><li>-Slave I (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Empire Strikes Back</span>)- A perfect mini model of only 20 pieces, and even has movable wings for some play. The best model in the calendar!</li><li>-Chewbacca (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Revenge of the Sith </span>through<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Return of the Jedi</span>)- I already have one, but it's nice to have another in case the older one breaks.</li><li>-X-Wing (Original Trilogy)- The R2 piece is just a great detail, and the wing open and close nicely.&nbsp;</li><li>-Battle Droid Pilot (Prequel Trilogy)- Everyone has battle droids galore, but this one is rather special because it has the special blue torso printing.&nbsp;</li><li>-R2-Q5 (Original Trilogy)- This little droid could only be found in really expensive sets... until now! It has a certain glossy feel, very nice.&nbsp;</li><li>-Republic Gunship (Clone Wars)- The use of the SNOT piece is absolutely amazing, and looks spot on.</li><li>- Y-Wing (Clone Wars &amp; Original Trilogy)- This set is done in 20 pieces marvelously, and doesn't require the use of naturally colored cheese slopes (Yellow, FYI).</li><li>-TIE Pilot (Original Trilogy)-The black head is all right in this set, mainly because it's a carrying tradition. It also carries another tradition of Pilots in the Calendar. This is rare, and nice.&nbsp;</li><li>-Millennium Falcon (Original Trilogy)-This set is perfectly done in 13 pieces. A printed dome would have made this set even more perfect, though.</li><li>A-Wing (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Return of the Jedi</span>)- Perfect set in 9 pieces, instantly recognizable and is the first mini-model of the A-Wing.</li><li>-Santa Yoda (None for Santa, all except <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A New Hope </span>for Yoda)-This holiday model is extremely nice, and even better than City's own Santa in detail and awesome factor.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Mechno-Chair (Prequel Trilogy)- This was quite confusing as to what it really was. It makes sense after a while, but I would be screwed without the calendar posts. <br></li><li>-""Chewie's Supplies Inc."" (no movie)- This could have been gone if it didn't have that crossbow, the only good part about this set.</li><li>-Dack Ralter? (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Empire Strikes Back</span>)- Luke's snowspeeder buddy may be an okay fig, but the blank helmet introduces a subplot of mystery and anger.<br></li><li>-Imperial Shuttle (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Empire Strikes Back</span> &amp; <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Return of the Jedi</span>)- This is an amazing model for only nine pieces, but the engines needed to be in the back. Also, the top middle wing is not the best choice.&nbsp;</li><li>-Clone Pilot (Clone Wars)- This is a great minifigure, but is ruined by the black head of stormtrooper-dom.</li><li>-Snowspeeder (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Empire Strikes Back</span>)- This model is actually perfect, except for the fact that there's no orange, and thus makes the set feel lifeless.&nbsp;</li><li>-Mouse Droid (Original Trilogy)- The little mouse droid is nice and appears in the same sets as R2-Q5, but could have easily been made by leftover bricks from many sets.&nbsp;</li><li>-Weapons Depot (None)- This set is another filler,and the weapons could have easily been included with each minifigure. Also, this reveals too many clues about future models.&nbsp;</li><li>-TIE Fighter (Original Trilogy)- This is spot-on in 7-piece design, but is not on scale with other sets, like the X-wing.</li><li>-Christmas Tree (None)- Although I really like this tree, some may find it to be very Charlie Brown-y. This tree also has my favorite magic wand ever. <br></li></ul>
<p>This set is really amazing for the great small sets, some of the best models ever made by Lego. The cons may be bad, but they're just minor things that don't affect the set's overall incredible power. This is a must buy. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
"rolomolo12345","2012-01-09T15:35:24.75Z","On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me AWESOMENESS! ","<p>Thank you Lego, its true ,you do listen to the fans and for about 5 years they have been screaming ""Lego&nbsp;star wars ad calender!"" and its&nbsp;finally&nbsp;here! I enjoyed this set allot every 24 days of it. The mini sets were amazingly detailed (for a mini set!) and knew everyday towards&nbsp;Christmas&nbsp;i would wake up to an amazing gift.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box was truly brilliant with 3d pictures and glossy outside. The colours were great and stood out the box, with the doors clearly marked of the days up to&nbsp;Christmas, which was taken in a traditional way with only 24 doors. The instructions were on the backs of the doors and were quite small, and as an experienced builder found it quite hard to figure out which piece went where, but i did do it in the end.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>In every door of opening i found a couple spare pieces which was good and the pieces in there can be made into allot of different builds of your choice. there was adleast 10-15 in each door so was a good piece count.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures were somewhat rare is some eyes but i could see some flaws with them, like some printing missing and back of the torso printing missing but its mostly good for any collection. and the last door had the&nbsp;Yoda&nbsp;""Santa"" figure and i thought he had some great detail.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The building of the small models was much fun for the upcoming days to Christmas and i loved every second. They were good builds but were quite hard as i said in the ""Box/Instructions"" paragraph</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>To put all the models together was a good experience as there is allot of play&nbsp;ability&nbsp;with them and they look very detailed and easily&nbsp;recognized iconic ships and figures.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I completely loved the advent calender and hope they have one next year and if you missed out this year, Get it next year!</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"Firox_5000","2012-01-07T18:55:35.85Z","An excellent gift from a galaxy far away","<p>It was 24 long days before Christmas in december and Iam so glad that I purchased this advent calendar. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts and playability from the models is very high and good especially for a 24 day advent calendar. For £24.99, the advent calendar is quite expensive for what it is but most of the days have excellent models. </p>
<p>Day 1/ Republic frigate, an excellent mall rendition of the full size Frigate, 9/10</p>
<p>Day 2, Nute Gunray, A fairly well designed figure however an exact copy of the seperatist shuttle model, 8/10, </p>
<p>Day 3, Meccano chair, a device separatists use however unfortunately despite being a accesserie for day 2's model seems rather boring in a way, 2/10. </p>
<p>Day 4, Spider Droid, an astounding micro scale version of the set which is exact to detail to the original full size one which came out in 2008, 10/10</p>
<p>Day 5, Slave I, An excellent represenation of the iconic slave I model which has been done in micro scale very well and even has movign wings, 10/10</p>
<p>Day 6, Chewbacca, a rather nice and fundamental figure from the original films however is a figure far from rarity and is perhaps now in request of a revamp, 6/10. </p>
<p>Day 7, Chewie accesserie, Nothing special on it's own however accompanies chewwie very well from day 6, 6/10. </p>
<p>Day 8, Dack Ralter, a figure who has not appeared much in the series and is a great addition to the calendar and also variating from previous models, 8/10. </p>
<p>Day 9, X-wing starfighter, despite it's frequent amount of mini remakes it's a model masterpiece which even has a micro R2 D2 included as well as accurate wing detail, 10/10. </p>
<p>Day 10, Imperial Shuttle, not quite as good as previous calendar mini models but still of a fairly good standard and good addition to the X-wing to play, 7/10. </p>
<p>Day 11, Blue Battle Droid, Despite being a very common figure in recent star wars sets, the blue one makes this one slightly rarer as it has not appeared in a few sets and goes well with Nute gunray from day 2, 7/10. </p>
<p>Day 12, Snow Speeder, Yet another excellent &nbsp;mini model which incorpates all other mini sets very well, 9/10.</p>
<p>Day 13, R2-Q5, An excellent droid figure who is a very rare figure having appeared in one set that is now discontinued and another that most lego fans could only dream for at £275. This figure contains a wonderful colour on this astromech droid, 10/10. </p>
<p>Day 14, Mouse droid, a nice little addition who like the astromech droid is very rare however is a very small model and does not offer much for day 14, 7/10. </p>
<p>Day 15, Republic gunship, An outstanding micro model of the gun ship which uses a few small parts but is very effective, 10/10. </p>
<p>Day 16, Clone pilot, You can never have too many clones and unlike droids are much more interesting and this figure is a great addition having not appeared for a while, 9/10.</p>
<p>Day 17, Clone accesseries, A little set of accesseries to accompani the clone trooper. Nothing special but improoves playability in many ways, 6/10. </p>
<p>Day 18, Y wing, A very nice Y-wing micro model which is great to add with the X-wing,10/10. </p>
<p>Day 19, Tie Defender pilot, a figure who is nothing special but has not appeared in many sets. A good and different addition to previous models in the calendar, 7/10.</p>
<p>Day 20, Tie Fighter, An ok model but out of scale from the X&amp; Y wing models and should have been a bit bigger really, 6/10. </p>
<p>Day 21, Millenium Falcon, the 8th version of the set and also the smallest. This set is an excellent micro model of the larger versions of the sets, 10/10. </p>
<p>Day 22, A wing starfighter, a rather plain simple model but is quite affective in what it's presenting, 8/10. </p>
<p>Day 23, Christmas tree, The only model in the calendar with no relation to star wars. But thats barely a bad thing as it is now very close to christmas at this time and all guesses go to who is expected on the last day, 8/10.</p>
<p>Dat 24, Yoda Claus, a new take on a classic figure who is packed with great festive detail and is arguably the best figure in the calendar, 10/10. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall score, 8/10, an excellent range of models from the vast majority of days and an excellent calendar. It may be more than the city one but it's much better in model quality and is easily the best advent calendar for christmas 2011. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can still find it around for a relistic price, I sugguest to get it. It's your choice as to whether you want to open it all at once or wait til next chirstmas but option B is much more fun!</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,2
"Huge_Nerd","2012-01-03T20:59:18.217Z","Better than the Star Wars Christmas Special!","I thoroughly enjoyed the Castle Advent Calendar last year, so when I heard there was going to be a Star Wars one, I had to have it. I was a little worried that the mix of mini (micro?) vehicles and minifigs would not mesh as well as other Calendars, but Lego did a great job of relating them to each other. All the mini vehicles are as spot on as possible given the size (and cost) restraints and most of the minifigures are pilots related to the vehicles. Even the mini-fig accessory gifts are decent and useful to a collection. I for one like the mecho-chair for Nute Gunray. As you can see from my brick ratings, I definitely found this Calendar better than the sum of its parts.<br><br>I have still seen this set on clearance at local stores and I definitely recommend picking it up and saving it for next year if you didn't get it this year. It looks like it will be better than next year's offering.<br>",TRUE,5,3,4,4,4
"AETerry","2011-12-29T13:38:19.283Z","Star Wars Advent Calendar Review","<p>I'm sure there's many of us who got a hold of this Advent for the Holidays, gifts to ourselves or for others. I dislike the bit of a steep price at $40, but there were a few places, that as Christmas got closer and they were trying to clear the shelves for the 2012 LEGO stock and sets. I say this as I did manage to pull off getting a second Advent at a greatly reduced Holiday Price to give to a friend's Grandson for Christmas.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box, like all of the LEGO Advent Calendars has a flap or lid that comes down to provide a display area and scene for all of the minikits and minifigures. The main box then has all 24 doors, that when opened have the instructions for assembling the minikit on the reverse side. A minor complaint is that not all the doors were perforated well enough to make it easy to open a particular day's door without tearing it. The polybags though for each day were very easy to pull open and get to the pieces without having to resort to scissors.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>In all, I'd say this is a great set for getting a number of extra parts. Some of the minikits still had extra pieces after putting the model together. And coming from the stand point of someone who's gotten the LEGO MBA subscription and has done the Micro Scale Kit 2, there's plenty of exercises with the minkits to practice thinking on a small scale and lots of parts to work with for other ideas.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures and Build<br></h4>Assuming you opened up each day one at a time and not all at once, the Advent Doors went as follows - <br><br>Day 1 - Mini Republic Cruiser- Shown in The Phantom Menace. This wasn't a bad opener to the Advent Calendar.<br><br>Day 2 - Nute Gunray- I understand he's a fairly rare minifigure. So I'm pleased to get a hold of him.<br><br>Day 3 - Mechno-Chair, used by wealthy Neimoidians&nbsp;such as Nute Gunray. If it hadn't been for the Brickset review of this set, I wouldn't have known that and been very much so confused. It's lack luster still in my opinion, but this is only day three so it has to get better.<br><br>Day 4 - OG-9 homing spider droid. I at least would have known this is a droid, thanks to Brickset I know which it actually is. Not too bad. Lots of good use of parts for a mini model.<br><br>Day 5 - Slave I Mini Model. As a fan of the Original Trilogy and Bobba Fett, this is one of my favorite ships and greatly makes up for the disappointment of the Mechno-Chair.<br><br>Day 6 - Chewbacca Minifigure. I understand he's also hard to find and get. With this Advent I am now up to 3 of him. He's a classic iconic character of Star Wars. <br><br>Day 7 - An accessory kit consisting of a tool barrel, wrench and hammer, and a sideways clip holding a crossbow. I do believe this is meant for Chewie and if I hadn't known he's supposed to be a good mechanic, I'd have been disappointed.<br><br>Day 8 - Dack Ralter Minifigure. Not bad for a minifigure. Again, if not for the Brickset Reviews I wouldn't have known who this is, but still have been pleased with the figure overall. I just find it odd there's no print on his helmet when the other two pilots I have like this one do have prints.<br><br>Day 9 - X-Wing Fighter Mini Model. Another favorite and Iconic ship of the Original Trilogy complete with a blue 1x1 round plate to depict R2-D2 in it.<br><br>Day 10 - Imperial Shuttle Mini Model. I suppose this is alright, but after the Slave I and X-Wing Fighter, this doesn't seem all that exciting.<br><br>Day 11 - Battle Droid Minifigure, - The torso is printed blue. Unlike many of the other minifigures, he's holding a blaster. It's okay, but I'm not a big fan of the new trilogy and the droids are just meh and blah.<br><br>Day 12 - Snow Speeder Mini Model. This isn't too bad of a build or model.<br><br>Day 13 - R2-Q5, Astromech droid. Very rare. Very sleek, very pretty in the awesomeness factor. I understand that this too is very rare and hard to get. This ranks as one of my favorites out the Advent.<br><br>Day 14 - Mouse Droid- And for this, we opened up Day 14... maybe if there had been more with it, like accessories for another Minifigure, this wouldn't feel so disappointing.<br><br>Day 15 - Republic Gunship Mini Model. I suppose this ship is iconic of the new trilogy, I at least recognized this ship off the bat as there's a slightly larger Micro-Scale Gunship that I've got and this is a very good likeness.<br><br>Day 16 - Clone Pilot Minifigure. It's not too bad, it certainly is far better than the Mouse Droid of Day 14.<br><br>Day 17 - Weapons Depot. Yeah, it's basically a little weapons rack holding a lightsaber, blaster and a couple of other pieces.<br><br>Day 18 - Y-wing Mini Model. Another Original Trilogy ship and a classic for that. While not one of my personal favorites, I can appreciate the level of detail given to this model.<br><br>Day 19 - TIE Pilot Minifigure. Another rare minifigure if I understand rightly. This makes up for any lack luster previous days have been having for builds or figures.<br><br>Day 20 - TIE Fighter Mini Model. They pulled off the technicals for a micro scale model, but it still seems lack luster and not as awe inspiring as other mini models.<br><br>Day 21 - Millennium Falcon Mini Model. This is better and makes up for the TIE Fighter, but now it's really noticed a lack of scale for the micro models. But it's the Millennium Falcon, one of -the- iconic ships from the Original Trilogy and&nbsp; it's done great for micro scale.<br><br>Day 22 - A-Wing Mini Model. I suppose it's alright, it's not all that great compared to other mini models, though it is better than the TIE Fighter.<br><br>Day 23 - Christmas Tree. Coming out of nowhere, yet all the same fitting the season for the Advent, we have a decent little Christmas Tree build.<br><br>Day 24 - Santa Yoda Minifigure. This is the minifigure everyone's been waiting for opening all of the doors. He's done very well with a print design for this torso that makes all of the other LEGO Santas look sad and very uninspiring.<h4>Summary</h4><p>I had fun taking the time to open up each of the doors on their respective days. And despite some days being blah on the minifigure, accessories or mini model gotten, over all I'd say this was a great Advent and it was indeed fun.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4

	Advent calendar isn&#39;t really a set I could write about much. There are a few neat mini models such as X-wing or Slave I, and a few that are completely pointless, like weapons stand or Nute Gunrays walking chair, or whatever it is. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t buy this set for myself, maybe because I enjoy challenging build, which this set lacks. However I got it without any special occasion from my girlfriend, so I was quite happy about it. It made a perfect foretaste before buying a Venator cruiser :)</p>

Try as I might, I couldn't wait for Christmas to build all the sets. While there are some very nice sets (X-Wing, Snowspeeder and A-Wing), some of the sets, (Nute Gunray's walking chair, TIE Fighter, Y-Wing) are lackluster. While none of the sets were very difficult, as a veteran builder, I was confused by the instructions which were found on the back door of every date. Certainly an instruction sheet in every date would be nice. &nbsp;I think where most of the value from this set comes from the mini-figures. My favorites are Nute Gunray, the Clone Trooper, R2-Q5, and the TIE Defender pilot are the best. If you are into mini-figures, go ahead and get this set. My only other suggestion would be to make the advent calendar itself more durable. As currently constituted, the box itself acts as the calendar. It is big and bulky and does not display well. It would be much cooler if there was a more displayable display for this set. All in all, a middle of the road set which is saved by the mini-figures.",FALSE,3,3,3,4,2
