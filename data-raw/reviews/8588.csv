"mountainbricks","2011-07-25T00:27:59.94Z","Great design, but not-so-great price...","<p>I still have the original Geonosian Starfighter set packed away somewhere from when I was young, and I remember that it was a very unusual shape, but almost too blocky for that kind of sleek starfighter feel it gave. Well, this ship fixes that problem- but is it worth the price?</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box is small. Surprisingly small. Lego is cutting back on box sizes, and this is one of their first steps. It's more horizontally rectangular than square-ish rectangular, and actually resembles the ship itself, so I think Lego did a good job with it. The instructions are nothing too special.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Uh-oh. 155 parts for $30? A piece-price ratio of nearly 50%? That's a failing grade, Lego! The old set had more pieces, at 170 for $20! Ah, well, that seems to be the trend these days. Some of these parts are new and large, which would explain the low piece count- the nice trans-clear Atlantis windshield, the brown boat pieces, and obviously the new minifig parts.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Clearly the winning factor for this set. Another Commander Cody is always welcome, and the Geonosian is a huge improvement over the last one. The head, torso, AND leg printing is brilliant. I just wish they had included wings, like in the original set. Well, we wait all these years for a Ki-Adi-Mundi and... he looks sort of ugly. Sometimes Lego takes it too far with these Clone Wars faces and molds! Well, we finally got him, and in a cheap set too, so it could be worse.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>Simple, not too complicated. There is actually a fairly large hole right in the middle of the ship, but looking at online pictures, it's actually supposed to be there!</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>A colossal improvement over the first model.&nbsp;The gun rotates nicely, the Geonosian fits just fine in the cockpit, and the bomb drop is a primitive but effective play feature. It looks shockingly sleek when you hold it in your hand.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Honestly, it's a fine set aside from the price. The minifigs are great for such a cheap set, and the ship, if I can say it one more time, is much better than Lego's first attempt.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Get it when it goes on sale- it's easily worth $20. Even if you don't collect Clone Wars sets, this is still a nice ship, plus I think it's featured in Attack of the Clones, so it can be considered a pre-trilogy set. Just be smart with your money, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised when you purchase it. Thanks for reading!</div>",TRUE,4,2,4,5,2

As a result, I decided to buy this bad boy and wow...I wasn't&nbsp;disappointed. It is significantly long and has (HOORAY!) has no stickers. Also, I really like the sand colored bricks. The rounded cockpit is much more accurate than the circular clear piece from the 2002 incarnation. The turret is also cool, as it can rotate left to right. The thruster on the tail is strange, as it rotates unnecessarily and is simply a rotating ball attached to a small disc. It fits in...but feels completely pointless. The figs are awesome. Ki adi is very well detailed and even has ridges on his head. His tunic is pretty detailed and the extended head is awesome...even though it does not look like a Lego in any way shape or form. The Genosian is significantly improved and looks very TV accurate. Notice how I said TV? Well that's the thing...the Genosian is the TV version and lacks the eyes on the side of the head.

"Huge_Nerd","2011-10-03T16:25:38.37Z","Swoosh!","<p>I got this set from my fiancee for a birthday present, basically because she knew I'm a Ki-Adi Mundi fan (in an ironic kind of way) and I always like Star Wars Legos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I like this set a lot more than I thought I would. It generally looked cool in the store, but nothing I was dying to get; however,&nbsp;in hand I am enjoying it quite a bit. The ship is a very nice size--great scale with other one-man fighters (mine is displayed with Vader's Tie and the Slave I and it fits in nice). It is also incredibly solid and swooshable. I generally don't fly my Legos around too often since I'm afraid&nbsp;I'll drop them and lose pieces, but this one just feels so sturdy I can't help but do so!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cockpit fits a minifigure perfectly and it won't slide around inside despite resting on a smooth, unstudded surface. The bomb-dropping gimmick is fun too. I've found pushing on the tab in the back of the hatch, rather than just pulling it open, makes the missile shoot out nicely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was nice and unique, although there's a couple spots in the top half that repeat what was done with the bottom half (common with symmetrical ships). There's also a&nbsp;lot of ""rare"" pieces that I haven't come across before (my 6 year old soon-to-be nephew calls all unique looking pieces ""rare pieces"" so I have come to do the same, lol). They give the ship that sleek look. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigures, in my opinion, are top of the line. They all are very detailed, each with back printing and the Geonosian even has leg printing. The Geonosian looks great piloting the ship and he's got a great, unique head piece. Cody is a famous clone (mentioned in Episode III by name, as well as the Clone Wars cartoon) so he's a nice addition. Finally, Ki-Adi Mundi is great. Yes he's ugly, but he's ugly in Star Wars fiction as well! I wouldn't want a pretty Ki-Adi Mundi!&nbsp;I also actully like his head being two pieces--it makes him more fun and Lego-ey. Plus, you can put the cone-head piece on other heads and hilarity ensues! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, onto everyone's complaint--the price. Yes, it's high for the piece count, but I think the blow is softened by the size of some pieces, the uniqueness and rareness&nbsp;of a lot of the pieces, and the rare and unique minifigures with their specialty pieces. Add to that the&nbsp;very accurate (that space some complain about is accurate to the CGI model), sleek, solid, and swooshable final model and I think the price can be justified for fans of Geonosis and/or the Geonosian starfighter like I am. Otherwise, for a more general Lego Star Wars fan, I think $25 is a worthwhile price to wait for.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"legoreviewer266","2011-11-21T01:21:15.34Z","Pricey...","<p>
	<b>Build:</b> The build was a lot better than I expected. It was easy and really enjoyable. Pretty much all the special pieces, such as Ki-Adi Mundi's head/hair piece and also with Commander Cody's gadgets; pistols, wiser, armour etc. They all came in a plastic baggy, which was really awesome. The pieces were also really nice and it had no stickers! There was only one printed piece and it was a control panel that I'm sure many of you have already seen. This set was super easy to build, took me half an hour to put together.</p>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<b>Mini figures:</b> Now there is not much to say about the figures that hasn't been already said. You get Commander Cody, Ki-Adi Mundi and Geonosian Pilot. However only Ki-Adi Mundi is exclusive and it's because they've never made him before, so he is a totally new figure. Commander Cody is also in 1 other set, which is set 7676 and there is&nbsp;absolutely no difference at all. The Geonosian Pilot is <b><i>NOT</i></b> exclusive, because he is going to be in a new set that's coming out in 2012 called the Geonosian Cannon, except he has wings, but he is still not exclusive. The reason he is considered as a pilot, is because he doesn't come with any weapons at all.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>
<div>
	<b>Set:</b> The set is really awesome, but there isn't too much to say about it. You get a really slick, swoosh able fighter and that's just about it. There is an opening cockpit, that allows you to put in the pilot. The cockpit shield is very well&nbsp;designed and there is really no gaps or spaces between the cockpit and where it closes. The figure fits really well and even though there is no bricks for you to peg them onto, the figure doesn't rattle around in there <i style=""font-weight: bold; "">AT ALL</i>, which I think is pretty clever as well. Since the Geonosian's head is bigger than most the other figures you see, they give you extra space, but he still doesn't rattle. There is also laser in the front that swivels side to side and the engine in the back is on a ""ball joint"". The other kind of main feature is the bomb underneath and the way that works is, there is a missile on the bottom and how that works is there is a hinged door and you've got to flip that back and the bomb will automatically deploy itself. It is an excellent&nbsp;function and it works great.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>
<div>
	<b>Conclusion: </b>The set is awesome, but not really sure if it's worth it... maybe $25US or $20US, not exactly $30US... especially considering it only has 155 pieces, but it's not too bad, maybe you should buy it on sale, otherwise it's pretty cool.</div>

"brickbuster2409","2012-10-06T21:33:33.213Z","Great Overall Geonosian Building Kit","<p>This set is a great basic Geonosian kit and a fair amount of building time and minifigures are included. &nbsp;While i do consider $30 a bit too much, it still is a fair investment although i did purchase mine on sale for $20. &nbsp;Now on to each section</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box design is well made. &nbsp;Decent size that fits the model design with a great backdrop to complement the action of the starfighter along with Jedi Ki Adi Mundi and Commander Cody. The back of the box doesn't show much worth mentioning other than additional picture angles of the set. &nbsp;The instructions are pretty basic and easy to follow. &nbsp;On the spot step by step instructions and pieces are organized very well by the numbered bags.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The parts are pretty basic. &nbsp;Standard Geonosian brown, burnt orange, gray and black pieces. &nbsp;A few unique pieces such as the round engine on the back of the starfighter and laser. &nbsp;The parts are well designed to fit the design and accuracy of the final product.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>The set includes some excellent figures. We first of all get Jedi Master Ki Adi Mundi who comes with his blue lightsaber. &nbsp;His torso contains backprinting for more detail. &nbsp;And he comes with his own unique headpiece on top of the standard lego head which blend well with each other. &nbsp;Next we have Commander Cody. &nbsp;He comes with many pieces for his helmet including binoculars and radio communication. &nbsp;Again detailed backprinting on his torso. &nbsp;And well appreciated design on his head even with a helmet covering it. &nbsp;Last we have a Geonosian Pilot. &nbsp;A fair amount of detail on his figure most notably his headpiece. &nbsp;Nothing too special or eye catching. &nbsp;No weapon included sadly. &nbsp;Overall a well balanced cast of minifigures and detail.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The starfighter was an overall fairly easy build. &nbsp;Nothing too complex or fancy. &nbsp;The cockpit and the hull of the ship has almost the same construction and form. &nbsp;Clever piece by piece design and construction. &nbsp;No flimsy or loose parts. &nbsp;Each piece fits well and tight in place. &nbsp;Shouldn't take more than 30-45 minutes to build depending on age.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>The final product is very satisfying. &nbsp;A hidden compartment on the hull of the ship contains a hidden missile. &nbsp;The laser can be moved around. &nbsp;The colors blend well with another. The design of the starfighter is rich, vibrant and colorful and looks very similar to the movie design. &nbsp;Great playability and action to be had, especially with younger children&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>This is a great geonosian set and well worth the price but more preferably at a sale price as i still stand by my opinion of $30 to be a bit too steep. &nbsp;But regardless a great investment in minifigures, design and playability. &nbsp;A must buy for any Lego Star Wars fan</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"THX_1138","2011-12-18T13:24:41.67Z","Better Than Expected","<p>I had wanted to get this set primarily for the minifigs, since two were exclusive and one was rare, and they were all ones I wanted badly.

I did have a little trouble differentiating black and dark grey, but that's normal these days.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Not bad, but not great either. On the plus side, there were a few useful unnecessary parts (1x2 light bley cheese slopes and some 1x3 plates) inside that I was able to take out of it without compromising the ship's appearance or structural integrity.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>One of the main reasons I wanted the set. Commander Cody is good, but the grey visor looks pretty bad on him. Thankfully, Arealight can remedy that. You get another set of clone armor and guns, which is nice. The Geonosian is awesome, with very detailed printing and a good head mold. I wouldn't have minded if they had kept the original one, except that they might not have been able to paint it. Ki-Adi Mundi is good aside from his ugly Clone Wars-style face.</p>
<h4>The Build</h4><p>Not the most interesting, and a little repetitive, but not bad.</p>
<h4>The Completed Model</h4><p>The fighter itself is way better than I had expected. I expected it to just be average, but it's actually really cool. The bomb dropping mechanism doesn't work very well, but I don't care, since I never keep those mechanisms anyway. The shape is way more accurate than the previous one, and the cockpit canopy piece works really well. The only big thing I wish was different is that I wish they had included stickers for the brown slopes on the front, but they don't look as bad as I had thought they would.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I might not feel quite as good about this set if I had paid the full price for it, but at $23, it's great. That sale ended, but I believe it can still be bought for about $25 at Target and on Amazon. Definitely get it, if you can get it below its official price.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,3

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>

<p>The box is the same quality as every other LEGO set. The front depicts the starfighter flying into battle against Ki-Adi Mundi and Commander Cody. Both Mundi and the Geonosian pilot are <strong>NEW!</strong> according to the list of minifigs featured in the bottom right-hand corner. The back shows the features of the ship (I&#39;ll talk about those later) and pictures of a few of the other sets that were new at that time.</p>

<h4>Parts</h4>

<p>Some interesting pieces in this one. There are a LOT of smooth slopes and some of them are&nbsp;in the orange-brown color. I think this is the first time I&#39;ve gotten one of the new bubble cockpits. Other than that, nothing new.</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>

<p>This is the second set to feature Commander Cody, the other one being <a href=""4490-1 Republic Gunship"">7676-1 Republic Attack Gunship</a>. (I own that one, too). The Geonosian pilot has a new print, and a new head mold. The entire front side of the figure has printing on it, even the hips. Ki-Adi Mundi has a new head print, of course done Clone Wars style, and his new robes are really cool and so far unique to this figure. Also, because he has two hearts, LEGO made a special mold for his tall head.</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<p>This was a very, very, VERY unique build because you build the two halves of the ship, nearly symmetrical, and connect them to a central base, accomplished with the use of Technic push-ins.</p>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<p>The completed model is very fun to play with. The ship has one forward laser cannon, and a special bomb-dropping feature.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Overall, this is an AWESOME set, but it&#39;s a bit pricey compared to <a href=""4478 Geonosian Fighter"">4478 Geonosian Fighter</a>, which also included the cannon. I would recommend this to any Clone Wars collector, so buy it while you can!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: Box art is a nice Geonosian background and some lasers and explosions. The instructions were clear and had no mistakes. It had 55 pages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: There are three minifigures in this set and two of them are unique to this set. The only separatist in this set is: Geonosian - Dark Tan. The Galactic Rebublic minifigures are: Commander Cody and Ki-Adi Mundi. They both are unique to this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: There are 155 pieces in this set. There is some good Dark Orange and Reddish Brown pieces for MOCs and other things.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: Again, as for the most of the sets I review I don&#39;t&nbsp;remember how were they to build like. But, there is at least one play feature on the fighter. You can drop bombs from the bottom of the ship. I would assume that the set would come with two or three bags, but I don&#39;t remember.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete Build: Overall the building experience and parts are nice, but the value for money is bad. $30 is not a good price. The playability is okay but still not the best. I would recommend picking this set up if it&#39;s on sale. So overall I would give this set a 4/5.</p>
