"parchioso","2011-06-20T10:58:12.82Z","Almost missed out this wonderful vehicle","<p>The new Infiltrator has a lot of detail contour, it makes use of a rich varieties of slope bricks to create the minute details of every section, the result is a bigger and more realistic Infiltrator. The cockpit/cargo space is relatively large for a starwars vehicle, the upper hatch has a printed pattern, and although the lower hatch plate is stickered, the design is very solid and fits the model beautifully with good playability, talking about playability, aside from the probe droids that can be released, there are flip missiles (I am not a missle fan though), foldable wings, and the hatch can be opened to see the interior, where the Sith speeder can be kept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set also has a rich inventory of minifigs, I actually like this head pattern of Darth Maul over the old ones (even though the old one was fine too) for the yellow eyes and sharper look, but of course, Darth Maul is a rare minifig, so if you happen to have a chance to get 7663, you may want to own it too to get that version of Darth Maul's minfig. The horned head is also amazing, my set has two pieces of it, I read about this horned head and it seems that the other minifigure that has it is Savage Opress in set 7957 Sith Nightspeeder. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Padmé now has a flesh color minifig head, Charaptain Panaka's minifig is nice, but I think the look lacks the masculine feel that the character should possess, the designer may have tried to create the cool lips but ends up mis-projecting a pessimistic feel. For Master Qui-Gon Jinn, the facial expression in this set is too soft, I prefer the old one that more closely reflect the movie character. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7961 Darth Maul's Sith Infiltrator is an example of how lego should design the Star war vehicles when it comes to details, in contrast 7663 is a rudimentary model, I am glad that I have not missed out this wonderful vehicle!</p>

I did get the second version, mostly because I missed out on the first, and it wasn't all that great either. And yes, I did the third version, and my wallet and my conscience are regretting it.</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Box/Instructions</span></p><p>The box is much, MUCH smaller than a $70 set should be, which frankly should have been the first little red flag to go up. However, Lego is reducing its box sizes, so it's not a big deal. The instructions are nothing special.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>What an awful piece-price ratio. Lego tends to have worse piece-price ratios in small sets, which is why the Geonosian Starfighter from this summer wave can be partially forgiven for its low parts count (partially), but on a $70 set? Frankly, the parts aren't even the problem here, it's the price. This should really be a $50, or at the most $60 set. $70 is ridiculous. That's all there is to it. As far as the parts go, there are some nice surprises here and there, especially those light bley quarter-dome pieces used around the cockpit. But the price is in no way justified.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Quite frankly one of the only good parts about this set. Qui-Gon looks a bit more worried than he should, but he has a nice printed torso and the new dark green lightsaber blade. Darth Maul is brilliant, and the new horn piece is not perfect, but better than just a hood (which is also included). Padme is not too different than the first, and her head is re-used, but hey, it's finally a Padme so no one should complain! And the Captain looks great- his hat is a good new mold, but like Qui-Gon, his face is not a perfect rendition of the character.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The cockpit is brilliant! It has a very finished feel to it, with sleek lines, and a brick-built back hatch instead of the old one-piece version. Very few faults are found in the rear of the ship.</p><p>The same cannot be said for the nose. In fact, very few GOOD things can be found in the front of the ship. The landing gear is ugly and technic-built. The inside is covered in unattractive technic studs. Lego ran out of ideas, so they just stuck some stickers featuring wires and greebling on the inside of the nose, which makes the ship feel like a half-finished attempt. Overall, it's the polar opposite of the rear of the ship.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It looks great, I'll give it that. The visual aspect is far better than the first or second versions of the ship. The lightsaber holder in the back is great, and Maul finally has a proper seat. It looks very finished... until you open that front nose. The main play feature, dropping the black probe droids, isn't bad, but there's just too much technic. Darth Maul's speeder bike rests nicely in its spot, but the bike itself is again, average.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the biggest blunder is that the ship is 100% UN-swooshable. The front nose flops open if you tip the ship upside-down. Lego couldn't have overlooked this; they just decided not to fix the problem.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Skip it. Unless you missed the first two versions, save your money, and if you have to have it, wait for some sort of sale and then grab it. The minifigs are fantastic, so you might want to grab them off Ebay or Bricklink, but the ship just isn't worth it. It really isn't; if I could un-do this purchase, I would do so in a heartbeat. It does have some nice features and design pros, but it has too many bad features and design flaws for me to give it a thumbs up, or even a shoulder shrug. Unfortunately, it gets a big ol' thumbs down, mostly due to:</p><p>a) The price, and</p><p>b) The unfinished and flawed front nose.</p><p>Put in the extra $20 and grab Anakin and Sebulba's Podracers instead! Thanks for reading!</p>",TRUE,2,3,3,4,1
"legoclone","2011-11-15T15:36:10.093Z","New Sith Infiltrator is a worthy addition to Star Wars villain's ships","I was at first hesitant to buy this one because I already owned 7663 and thought my Sith Infiltrator needs were already met.&nbsp; However, 7663 just didn’t sit quite right with me so I took a chance on this new one and I have to say I am very pleased I did. The fact that TRU discounted it $10 also helped me take the leap.&nbsp; Lego has fixed many of the deficiencies that 7663 had with this new Sith Infiltrator.&nbsp; First and foremost they made 7961 bigger! Now I fully understand that they couldn’t make this ship to true mini-fig/movie scale size or it would be a $300 set but 7663 always seemed a bit small to me. Old&nbsp;7663’s Darth Maul had to settle for a ship that wasn’t much bigger than a Tie Fighter to zoom around the galaxy doing his dastardly deeds and&nbsp;that seemed quite insufficient.&nbsp; 7961 is about 30% bigger.&nbsp; 7961 also allows you to store his speeder bike in the nose without him having to sit on it all the time in the cockpit as in the old kit. Lego lifted the ship up a bit with the landing gear so that it doesn’t have to sit on its folded s-foils while on the ground like 7663 did.&nbsp; The new S-foils look nicer and are a bit more substantial than on the older kit and stay connected better.&nbsp; The rear section of the ship is very solid and well built and the doors folding up and down to access the cockpit look pretty sharp.&nbsp; The nose of the ship looks pretty good from the outside but it is a little bit flimsy and open with a technic frame.&nbsp; I do, however, appreciate that the Lego designers probably did this so that they could make the ship appear bigger without driving up the piece count (and price) too high so I can live with it.&nbsp; It certainly gives you a platform for modifications to make it more solid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, when swooshing the nose opens up if you go inverted so I am going to have to try to figure out how to add some sort of internal latch for that from spare parts.&nbsp; The stickers weren’t too bad as almost all of them went on a piece with a square right-angle so they were relatively easy to line up correctly.&nbsp; The Darth Maul mini-fig includes the horns this time (and, unlike Savage Oppress, the color on his face and the horns is a good color match).&nbsp; The other 3 mini-figs are nice additions that add completely new mini-figs to most Lego Star Wars collections.&nbsp; The speeder bike is a little sparse but it is an improvement over the one with 7663 and at least it has a proper storage spot this time around.&nbsp; With the extra room in the nose it also might be possible to build a better speeder bike and still fit it in there. All in all I feel like the new Sith Infiltrator is a ship that can now proudly sit next to the transportation of other Star Wars Sith villains (Grievous’ Starfighter, Dooku’s Solar Sailer, The Rouge Shadow) and look like it measures up.",FALSE,4,4,5,3,5
"Shistavanen_brick","2011-12-14T18:20:33.803Z","Halfway there...","<div><br></div><h4>About the set.</h4><div><br></div>To many, this is yet another version of the Sith Infiltrator. To me, this is brand new as I missed out on the previous ones. The set comes with a ship and no less than FOUR minifigs and 2 of them are brand new, while the other 2 are remakes of old figures. Reading and watching reviews of this set made me a bit cautious, should I really get it or not. Then the opportunity arose and I found it on sale. It was to bigger bargain to refuse, so here we are.<div><br></div><h4>Minifigures.</h4><div><br></div><div><b>Padmé</b>: Anakin's darling Padmé (Amidala...) makes her first appearance in the brick galaxy and I really think it is a rather nice addition. She has a happy face and another, where it looks like she got up on the wrong side of the bed. Or maybe she's just being a cool girl saving the universe. Has a standard blaster.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Qui-Gon</b>: He looks fantastic and has improved since his last appearence in the early 2000's. His face is concentrated and stern, but in a good way. Sort of like, this is a guy who I'd like to have on <i>my</i> side during a space-battle. Lots of printing on the torso. Comes with the ""new"" darker green lightsaber.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Captain Panaka:</b> In my opinion, he's probably the coolest of all four. Liking the colours on his uniform and the Naboo captain's hat. A future Naboo soldier battle pack would be nice to accompany him. He carries the smaller blaster, which sort of fits him.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Darth Maul</b>: Maul truly goes horned warrior in this version. Some have called it a bit lame, for him to have that ""horn-crown"" on his head. But I rather fancy it, it makes him look a bit more Sith.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>The ship.</h4><div><br></div><div>I really enjoyed the build. Or at least, halfway through the build. Regardless of the ammount of stickers (which wasn't all that annoying, honestly.) I found half the ship really enjoyable to build. As a couple have already pointed out, the back of the ship is exciting and comes to life with the hatchet and compartment. It models fairly nice around the edges of the back-part. The wings, which are movable, adds to a nice touch when the ship is either in landing or space-cruising mode. There's nothing that I can think of that I don't like about it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, we have the haggard front. It didn't annoy me as much as I thought it would (yet). However, it does look a bit unfinished in some aspects. What I dislike the most is that the top doesn't stay put like most other space ships. Just imagine Mr. Maul going through the universe in lightspeed (or <i>ludicrous speed</i>) and the top flies up! Not a pleasant moment, I'm sure...&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>True, we do get a very technic-based ship. I kind of like the sturdiness of that fact though. As a display piece I can still appreciate it, unless you are looking at it directly from the side and you see through the hollow base on the front of the ship. It's quite long, some said in the length of 7676 (Republic Attack Gunship), although 7676 has tons of features that this ship doesn't even come close to in a longshot!</div><div><br></div><div>I like that you get his sith-speeder with it too. It was a nice gesture from LEGO. The probe droids look just milk-and-water to me. They lack in coolness.</div><div><br></div><h4>Summary.</h4><div><br></div><div>I am quite satisfied with the ship and the minifigures you get. For me, who got this at a very reduced price, it didn't feel like a huge loss to have a go with the set. It's a classic prequel saga-ship, no matter which version you have. I only have this so I can't really compare with the others. So if you, like me, doesn't have this ship, I think this can be a good buy. I'm pretty sure master-builders can find ways to MOC the front, add some cool engine parts and fasten the front so it doesn't flip up. I am satisfied halfway through...</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>It's a classic ship.</li><li>Nice detailed minifigures (finally Maul can look more of his movie-self).</li><li>NEW minifigures!</li></ul></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>The somewhat ""unfinished"" touch to the front. It's just weird.</li><li>The price doesn't match up to what you get, unless you get this on sale.</li></ul></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,3
"CapnRex101","2011-08-01T18:10:39.06Z","7961 - Darth Maul's Sith Infiltrator","<p>This set was perhaps the one I was looking forward to less than most of the others, but I have found it to be&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;worth purchasing! Sure, it is not the highlight of this latest group of sets, however despite this it is still a nice set to own. The&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;are nice, and the&nbsp;model&nbsp;itself is not bad at all, easily the best of the three Sith Infiltrators released by Lego up to now. So before you write off this set read my review and see what you think.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is fine, a strange shape, it is very thin, not very tall and very wide, it is not a shape I have seen before (or not recently at least). The image on the front of the box is very attractive showing the ship landed with Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul (who is riding his speeder)&nbsp;duelling&nbsp;in the foreground, and Padme and Captain Panaka running&nbsp;towards&nbsp;the ship to help out against the Sith apprentice. The two Dark Eye Probe Droids have just been dispatched and are flying off into the background, which is of a Tatooine landscape filled with sand and Mesas. There is also a line up of the four&nbsp;Minifigures in the set with a stamp proclaiming that Darth Maul and Captain Panaka are new figures!</p><p>There are two instruction books, both were fine and I had no missing pieces.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are many useful parts in this set including a huge number of plates of various shapes and sizes, the eight light grey quarter dome pieces are also exclusive to this set, and they could be very useful for creating your own models making the model all the more appealing. There are quite a few slopes too which could come in handy in future. There is one very nice printed piece, the dish which adorns the top of the cockpit area which also appeared in the previous edition of this set, set 7663 - Sith Infiltrator.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;in this set are excellent, the characters are all protagonists in Episode I who have not been seen in Lego for a few years (or in the case of Captain Panaka, never) and because of this could be appealing to Minifigure&nbsp;collectors. The three figures who have been seen before are in my opinion all a vast&nbsp;improvement&nbsp;over any of their previous incarnations,&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;Qui-Gon who is far more detailed than he has been in the past. He has not been seen since 2007 and that figure did not include his famous hair, so this is the first time that has been seen since 1999. His head is far more detailed than in the past as well, which is fantastic, the torso is highly detailed too with back printing, this torso is also seen on Obi-Wan Kenobi in set 7962 - Anakin Skywalker and Sebulba's Podracers. He also includes a brown cape, plain brown legs and a green lightsaber in the new darker shade of green. Next we have Padme who has not appeared since 1999 so is brilliant for collectors who missed out on the earliest Lego Star Wars sets. This figure is also far better than the previous ones. She has plain black legs, a nicely printed torso with front and back printing, the head is double sided, one angry face, one happy face, and has also appeared on Hermione in some Harry Potter sets. The hair is the same mould as that from 1999 but is a slightly lighter brown colour. She also includes a pistol with a scope which is a nice little addition.</p><p>However my favourite two figures from the set are Captain Panaka and Darth Maul, although I cannot decide which is better! Captain Panaka features sand blue legs, a fantastically detailed torso with many creases on the front and back. He has a troubled expression on his face which is a sort of light brown colour, reflecting his&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;in the film. However it is the incredible hat which I love the most, it is amazing with intricate detailing and striking colours, the neck shield and strap are a light brown, the brim is gold and the top part is a vivid dark red, a lovely combination.&nbsp;</p><p>Darth Maul is also wonderful, with plain black legs, a nice torso with back printing, a black cape, and then a very nice head with the new Zabrak horn piece too! The detail of his tattoos is simply fabulous, one of the most detailed heads I think I have seen. Of course he has his trademark double bladed lightsaber and even includes a black hood as well!</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build took me about an hour and was quite engaging and fun. Not the best&nbsp;build&nbsp;ever but it did have a good mix of&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;and regular brick sections to build which kept me interested. There are admittedly a lot of stickers in this set though, including (annoyingly) two stickers which must be applied to dimpled slopes, which are notoriously difficult to stick down for them to stay in place, if you touch them too much they may slip, but they are easy enough to put back.&nbsp;</p><p>The build was however fairly simple and could easily be completed by a young child.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When built, I was surprised by the size of the&nbsp;model, it is actually very big, a similar length to set 7676 - Republic Attack Gunship. There are several features including a very nice&nbsp;opening&nbsp;cockpit, two flick-fire missiles, a place to store the speeder and a feature for dropping the two Probe Droids. This wide range of features could make the set attractive to children. The cockpit is very well detailed, with two levers and several control panels.&nbsp;Beneath&nbsp;the cockpit Darth Maul's&nbsp;lightsaber&nbsp;can be stored on a small rack. Under the forward panel where the Probe Droids and speeder are stored there is also quite a lot of detail with two stickers of exposed engine parts which look very good. This is a good set for either play or display, but is not the best in either field sadly.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, despite this set's flaws, I think it is certainly worth a&nbsp;second&nbsp;look and would advise you to buy it, however the price tag is quite optimistic considering what you get so for that reason I am knocking a point off and give this set...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4

"Chills","2012-12-18T08:55:01.487Z","An improved set with great minifigures.","<p>I have Sith Infiltrator 7151, the old school set, but since that one was lacking in so many areas I put this set on my Wanted List. I was able to grab it in a lot with a couple of other sets on ebay for quite a discount. Overall I'm pleased with this version of the Sith Infiltrator, though there could be some improvements. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First off this set is much better designed than 7151. That one was very flimsy, just like the TIEs of the period. This version is solid, its hull is based around technic parts and uses bricks with the thick 3-brick wide pins to keep the main sections together. The rear section is all plates and bricks, and holds together well when swooshing around.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The set really looks like the ship from Ep I. It has the shovel front and the TIE inspired rear section. It also has an improved version of the Sith Speeder, plus 2 seeker-droids that are pretty much the same as from 7151. The rear section was a lot of fun to build, there's a lot of detail in there. I especially like how the rear doors open and the ramp folds down. Nicely designed. <br></li><li>Pro 3: There are some great minifigures with this set. Padme and Captain Panaka are new to my collection, as is this version of Qui-Gon Jinn. This Darth Maul is completely different from the one in 7151, face, torso, and the horn crown. I like this last part.</li><li>Pro 4: There's decent playability with this set. The speeder and droids can fit in the hull, and the later can be deployed with trap doors. There is a light-saber holder, and there's also landing-gear. The wings fold in just like in the movies, too.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The first negative I noticed building this set was the speeder is very basic. It's only a few parts and lacks detail, especially around the engines.<br></li><li>Con 2: The front part of the hull feels like it wasn't finished. The top looks cool, but from the sides and bottom its like you have the frame but not a completed hull. <br></li><li>Con 3: Stickers! There are quite a few in this set, which did get a bit annoying. I would have liked to have seen printed bricks. <br></li></ul>
<p>Overall I'm pretty happy with this set. Compared to 7151 it is a huge improvement, much more solidly designed, better playability, it really looks like the ship from the movie, and 4 minifigures are a plus. If you are looking for a Sith Infiltrator for your collection I would definitely recommend this set. I gave it 4 bricks, but truth be told I would give it 3.5 if I could because of the unfinished feel to a couple of parts. But in my opinion that doesn't detract much from how cool this set is; especially if you search a bit you can get it for under RRP.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
