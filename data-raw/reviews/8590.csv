"parchioso","2011-06-12T06:59:05.833Z","A truly impressive set that makes the podracers available to all","<p>Many of us have probably missed 7171 Mos Espa Podrace and I would say this new Podracer set is truly excellent and not disappointing.</p>
<p>Compared to 7171, here we got only two podracers without Gasgano's, but aside from that, and the use of stickers instead of printed plates, there are improvements in all areas:</p>
<p>1. Larger podracer body with excellent details</p>
<p>For Anakin's pod racer, there are more details at the engine, which makes it more solid, and the cockpit also has a small flipped wing, but the biggest improvement comes in Sebulba's Podracer, the main engine is composed of Arm with Clip, Rods and wheel cone, which not only gives more details and size to the podracer, but also power and contour, the four solid side engines are more sophisticated, the use of more slopes and curves all over the podracer make it look wonderful, although there is no more printed parts, but the stickers mix well into the model.</p>
<p>The beams connecting the cockpits to the engine is now transparent, while I feel that it may look better with colored beams, I read about some writing saying that the transparent beams would create a sense of electric current, what do you think?</p>
<p><br/>2. The stands</p>
<p>One of the caveat of the old podracers has got to be the way it is made to stand, using a few bricks to elevate it is too plain, now there is a nicely crafted stand, and the use of transparent bent beam makes the display look great, I wish the base stand are all transparent parts as well. This is a sample that perhaps we can use for setting up display for models that cannot stand naturally like the pod racers</p>
<p><br/>3. Minifigs</p>
<p>Sebulba is now in color and not monochrome, which makes the old minifig not appealing at all, the same happens with Watto, this set includes two of the rarest Lego Starwars minifig, I can still recall people selling Watto at very high price in local market (I think the Bricklink price is still very high), this is a great opportunity to get these figures, the better ones too. But this also raise an interesting topic, with a better and general available new minifig around, would it have any impact on the selling price of the old minifig?</p>
<p>Another goodie would be Wald, although this is not a super character but I think it is his first appearance in Lego.</p>
<p>Anakin has also great surprises, the head is a two side one, and the helmet has nice pattern, I like this new version a lot! </p>
<p>And you also get the old good Obi-Wan, it is not something special but it is a bonus too.</p>
<p><br/>4. Price</p>
<p>I think this set is reasonably priced, with two bigger, better and nicely designed pod racers, and all the wonderful minifigs coming with it, I think there should be no complaint on the pricing this time?</p>
<p><br/>5. Packaging of Finished product</p>
<p>The design actually allows you to pack the finished podracers into the box with qiute some free spaces! A nice design for people with limited storage space at home.</p>
<p><br/>No doubt this is a must get set, and I think Lego has done a wonderful job this time.</p>

Pros:

Solid Designs.
Lots of gribble details on the pod engines.
Transparent Technic Beams
The MINIFIGS
Great colors. Deep Yellow and Orange color parts. The parts are well manufactured.
Exciting and Fun Build. No Boring Parts
The build of the stand for the Pod racers was a breeze.
Really had the feel of the two wanting to blast of for the race at the end of the build!
Numbered Bags for modular building.
Exceptionally high swooshable set.

Cons:
Minor sticker application. but i don't see a real problem.. can do without it.
Is that Qui Gon or Obi Wan?
Difficult to put to rest for display

Overall... its a set worth buying. I can attach it to a motorized track and make a slot car racing competition. ",FALSE,5,4,5,5,5
"Niallskie","2011-08-27T06:10:07.387Z","Race is on...","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Got this set from our local TRU here in Oregon, I was about to get it when I got the 20% off on one item promo, then TRU gave 25% off on some Star Wars sets. Sweeeet deal even if TRU usually jack-ups their lego prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; On to the review, minifigures are awesome and most of them are exclusive on a podracing set. First time I got a Sebulba, Wald and Watto figures. Obi-wan is a usual figure, but Anakin's racing face with the goggles is fantastic. The build on both podracers are intricate and lego gave justice to both vehicles. I loved how they used clear bricks to connect the Podracer Machine to the pod, unlike the old set I see. One thing they could have improved though is instead of using flesh colored pegs, they could have use see through as well. Also the vehicles are well balanced (as it should be) and is actually removable from the stand for playability. Would have been better if the vertical brick that connects the stand to the pod machines is foldable or removable, but then again they are awesome as they are, swooshable is fantastic. Sticker is always a minus to me, as having the lego pieces printed makes it more personalized to that set. Other than that i am very very satisfied with this set, would love it if the price is a bit lower but hey, it is what it is. Atleast if we wait enough, there will be a deal to get this sets and other sets at a bit lower price right. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would highly recommend this set for those who love the Star Wars movies and lego collectors. I dont think lego will me the other podracers on the movie but that would be awesome to complete the entire racing scene in the movie. I don't know if lego just did the backing board for the building instructions, but that would have been very nice if it was continued to all lego sets. Mine got folded in the middle, and the edge got folded really hard. One more thing i liked on this set is that it has only one instruction. I dont know about other people, but i preffer only one instruction regardless if its thick or not.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

<p>This is a beast of a set.&nbsp; I managed to pick it up half price via another member on here and it is huge value!&nbsp; It is a really enjoyable build, it looks fantastic when done and has loads of playability for kids.&nbsp; I love the scale of the set also.&nbsp; The pod racers look like the stupidly fast,&nbsp;big racing machines that they are.&nbsp; It is currently on display in our living room and just look the business!&nbsp; The stands are excellent.</p>

<p>810 parts in all.&nbsp; Great colours with loads of orange flats in there.&nbsp; I particularly like the clear technic beams.&nbsp; I haven't come across them before but they look&nbsp;brilliant in this set.&nbsp; The huge orange engine casings work really well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Build</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loved it!&nbsp; 6 numbered bags so there are never too many pieces to hunt through.&nbsp; There is some repitition in the build but I didn't mind it.&nbsp; The engines have to be similiar after all.&nbsp; It all fits together fantastically well.&nbsp; Lovely detail on the engines and the 'reins' fir beatifully well.&nbsp; The use of the technic beams to bring it all together is well thought out and the fact the Lego have nice stands to put them back on when you have finished racing is a very good idea indeed.</p>

"CapnRex101","2011-07-31T18:45:01.703Z","7962 - Anakin Skywalker and Sebulba's Podracers","<p>Well, I have to say this is one set that I have been looking forward to getting since I first saw the preliminary images of it, and I am once again delighted, not only has this set met my expectations, but it has far surpassed them in every way! The Minifigures are brilliant, the&nbsp;playability is fantastic, and the&nbsp;aesthetics&nbsp;of the&nbsp;models&nbsp;are incredible. I do own the older large Podracing set, 7171 - Mos Espa Podrace, and this is simply an unbelievable step-up from that, every aspect of the set is better (except perhaps the price) and I love it!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is spectacular featuring Sebulba and Anakin in their&nbsp;Podracers&nbsp;side by side, inevitably Sebulba can be seen cheating, as one of the four hidden saw blades has begun chopping into Anakin's&nbsp;Podracer's&nbsp;right engine. The background is a blurred image of the desert flats part of the Podracing course which really gives the illusion of speed and looks amazing. Standing (or hovering) dangerously close to the two racers are the other three Minifigures in the set, which takes us nicely on to the shot of the five figures included, standing alongside one another, with of course a stamp telling us that the figures are almost all new.</p><p>There is surprisingly only a single instruction book, but it was&nbsp;nevertheless&nbsp;perfect with no mistakes and I had no missing pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are one of the three components that make this set as good as it is, firstly, the sheer variation of parts, there are lots of plates, many engine parts and even more pieces in new colours! The&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;beams and struts are wonderful in this translucent colour and I think these will become very&nbsp;desirable&nbsp;parts in future, also the fact that there is just so much orange in this set makes this model very attractive to people who hope to get as many orange parts as possible to build their own creations.&nbsp;</p><p>However I find the inclusion of eight gold long staff pieces, and four shorter gold staff pieces the highlight of the parts selection, they have come in some Ninjago sets quite recently, but I still just love the look of them and they look amazing when they are&nbsp;incorporated&nbsp;into Sebulba's Podracer.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Another of the three factors which make this set great are the Minifigures, they are absolutely brilliant, all new (although Anakin also appears in set 7877 - Naboo Starfighter) and all fantastic. I will start with the young Anakin Skywalker, this figure is identical to that in the Naboo Starfighter, however this one features a beautifully printed helmet which is very highly detailed and quite accurate to the&nbsp;helmet&nbsp;worn in the&nbsp;film. The torso is highly detailed and includes back printing, like many recent Minifigures. The legs are plain and short as you would expect and the head is double sided, one side shows a very determined face with some flying goggles and the other shows an innocent but serious face with freckles. Obi-Wan Kenobi is also a nice figure, albeit a little out of place in this scene. He includes tan legs, a nicely detailed torso with back printing, and a double sided head, one with a wry smile and the other with a serious look on his face, both have a slightly odd chin but it does not take away from the figure as a whole as it is mostly obscured from view by the brown hood. That's right, the Lego company's apparent phobia of giving their young Obi-Wan figures hair has resurfaced, at only one or two points in the film did Obi-Wan wear his hood, but there it is. Of course the Minifigure also includes a brown cape and a blue lightsaber. Next is Wald, again, the inclusion of this figure leaves me a little confused&nbsp;as to why he is present, I mean, he barely speaks in the film and when he does talk, he is not worth listening to. However, whatever Lego's reasons for including this figure (most probably an excuse to use the Rodian head again) he is very nice, with a very well detailed torso, short tan legs and a Rodian head in a new colour,&nbsp;unlike&nbsp;what we saw with Greedo or Onaconda Farr.</p><p>The two highlight figures however are Watto and Sebulba, two of the best Minifigures in this latest wave of sets. Sebulba is lovely, he is made up of three parts, the body and head is one piece, then the two legs are separate poseable pieces. The printing is fantastic and very detailed with some rather evil looking slit eyes, flying goggles and a full grey body suit, just like the one from the Phantom Menace. It also features a grip on the Dug's arms which is capable of clutching regular bar pieces. Of course this newer figure blows the older lump of plastic out of the water, as does Watto, who is also a great addition to your collection and consists of a pair of sand blue short legs, a sand blue plain torso, and a very detailed torso and head piece which is wonderful, it is slightly rubbery and features detailing including belts and his classic jagged, ugly teeth. This Minifigure is also a huge improvement on the older one, which was just one colour and had almost no detailing in the mould either. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is hugely entertaining, it took me about two hours and is almost never repetitive or boring! Some of the building techniques used in these models are great, especially in Sebulba's Podracer, where the structure and detail is fantastic (not to say that Anakin's Podracer isn't good too, but I felt Sebulba's stood out for me). On occasion there were repetitive moments, but with a set like this there are bound to be, the engines on each Podracer are of course almost an exact mirror image of the other engine, but nonetheless, a great build experience to be had here.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Once the set is built you realise how perfect these vehicles actually are. Despite the use of a huge number of stickers (some thirty-one) the models look incredible. I know I keep saying it but I find it difficult to express how much detail there is in this, everywhere there seems to be an elegant curve or exposed engine part meaning that which ever way you look at each Podracer from, you will always be astounded by the level of thought that must have gone into designing this set.</p><p>What this set does lack is features, there is really only one or perhaps two, them being the&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to adjust Anakin's air intakes, and to reveal Sebulba's hidden saw blades used for slicing up other racers! I find the four saw blades very interesting as I was keen to see how they folded away, but they are very well hidden in person. You might think that the apparent lack of features would put off younger buyers, but I think not as the models are both very swooshable and sturdy, far more so than in the earlier Podracers sets.</p><p>Anyway, I have been eager to say it and now here is my chance, the engines on both Podracers are unbelievable, one of the most detailed (there's that word again) parts of any Lego set I have, pure brilliance, you cannot truly&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;it until you have it in your hands.</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Summary</span></p><p>Of course this set is absolutely without a doubt the best Podracing related set yet released by Lego, I have not got a single fault with it, except perhaps the number of stickers you get, but to me that is very minor. For those of you concerned about the fairly hefty price tag on this set, I wouldn't worry about it, I can just about&nbsp;guarantee that once you have it&nbsp;this&nbsp;will become a favourite. It is just about the all round perfect set, for play or display, and that is why of course I have no choice but to award this set...</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 10/10&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"LegoAthos","2012-12-23T11:14:40.49Z","I didn't like it","<p>Even picking up this set for only $30, I'm still not convinced it was worth it. Going against most other reviewers opinions, I was disappointed in this set. Its hard to even say why. I guess it lacks that magical <em>je ne sais quoi </em>that I've found in some other sets (Haunted House, MMV, LoTR sets, etc). And Star Wars just isn't doing it for me anymore... so&nbsp;I won't use this as&nbsp;a play or display piece and the parts just aren't that great for MOCing. If they'd have used more orange for Sebulba's podracer, I might have been more impressed.</p>

"Chills","2012-09-29T19:05:37.25Z","""Racers start your engines!""","<p>I was at the Lego Store earlier this year picking up the newest Hoth Base and I saw this set with both pod racers. The bright colors and big box caught my eye, so I logged onto BrickSet on my iPhone and added it to my Wanted List, even though I'm not a big Ep I fan. This set was lower on my priority list, and that was my mistake. This is a FANTASTIC set! It is designed well, the build was a lot of fun, the colors are great, and the minifigures included are excellent.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First off you get over 800 pieces and 2 pod racers in this set. Lots of fun packed into one box. Both sets are spot on replicas from The Phantom Menace. Sebulba's pod racer is bright orange with black and white highlights, its big and bulky; while Anakin's is blue and yellow, slim and sleek. Lego did well designing the pod racers to look just like the ones from the movie.</li><li>Pro 2: There's a lot of detail with these sets, especially on Sebulba's racer. The orange is used liberally, and other colors are used for details, including gold which is not very common. There are small bits all over the engines of both racers which helps with the detail of the 'hot-rod' look. The designers used SNOT techniques for detail. Anakin's cockpit has nice detail, but Sebulba's is sparse.</li><li>Pro 3: The build was a lot of fun. The bags are divided up into small sections, so one isn't hunting through large piles for greeble pieces. Everything goes together smoothly, though its important to pay attention to the pieces to add during the steps with stickers. I missed the 1x1 plates a couple of times.</li><li>Pro 4: The minifigures are fantastic! Five minifigures in this set which are all great additions to your collection. Young Anakin has two faces, one that looks like he's trying to figure something out and the other with pod racer goggles on. His legs don't bend, but that's normal for the short-leg piece used. Same goes with Watto and Wald (these two also very well done and well detailed). Sebulba is the same one from the Planet Set, and Obi-Wan Kenobi is unique to this set. He also has two faces, one that's mischievous and the other serious-looking. It looks like his face is the only detail that sets him apart from other Obi-Wan mini figures... but that's enough to warrant a difference.</li><li>Pro 5: These sets are swooshable, but take some care when flying them around. The transparent Technic pieces used to attach the engines to the pods could be a little more sturdy. Otherwise, these are well-designed sets. I also dig the small stands that the pods sit in. They slide in and out easily.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: There are not many negatives about this set, but the one that jumps out at me is the stickers. You get quite a few to decorate both pods. None are tricky to put on, but there are numerous spots to pause the build to apply stickers. Be ware.</li><li>Con 2: I would like to have seen a little more detail in the cockpits. Sebulba's is bare, and Anakin's control rods are just simple levers. I think they should have looked more like the control arms of the new speeder bike sets, with a couple of nozzle pieces attached to robot arms.</li></ul>
<p>I got this set for a great deal when buying a lot of this one, 7961 (Infiltrator) and 9500 (Fury Interceptor) on eBay. This set at retail price is a decent value, but a little hunting can reveal one of these fantastic sets for a bargain. I would recommend this to any Star Wars fan, even if you're mainly an OT fan like me and not big on the new three. The set has great minifigures, is a fun build, and has really cool colors. Although I don't have any other example of the pod racers comparing photos of other versions I would say this has to be the best one Lego has made to date. Grab it while you can!</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
"moo10032","2014-05-05T23:21:40.06Z","Could have been designed a lot better...","<p>Overall this could have been so much better... First off it lacks a 3rd pod racer like the original set did we need more pod racers!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Awesome mini-figs all around could have used some more like others have mentioned.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The pink laser effect that keeps both pods together really should have got its own unique piece that actually looked right instead of just a pink line, mine was filled with many bubbles and it just looks wrong. Also that same piece should have been integrated into the mounting point for the clear support arm instead of a seperate mounting point behind that laser. Also the connector pieces inside the clear support should have ALSO been clear. The engine intake and exhaust also just doesnt look at good as other sets do</p>

"PooPotato","2014-03-26T05:31:46.487Z","Now This Is Podracing! (For the right price of course)","<p>The famous podracing scene from The Phantom Menace has been a favorite of mine ever since I was a little kid. &nbsp;Like it has been mentioned in my other reviews, I missed out on &nbsp;A LOT of larger sets during my childhood, and likewise I have been purchasing their far better remakes the past 5 years. &nbsp;Now I intended to buy this set when it first came out, but balked at the 90 dollar price tag. &nbsp;I understand that there are 810 pieces, but a majority of these are rather small. &nbsp;Luckily they weren&#39;t selling very well at my local Walmart and were put on clearance for $55! &nbsp;So I quickly bought this set, saved myself $35, and had a blast overall.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>Nothing special about the box or instructions.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Like I mentioned earlier, a lot of the pieces are smaller than your average set. &nbsp;There are barely any plates and bricks, and a lot of the parts are technic to support the large undistributed weight (especially in Sebulba&#39;s podracer). &nbsp;The color orange tends to be a rare color, so if you are a parts cannibal you might want to get this set.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>Not all of the minfigures were new for me, as I owned the previous version of Obi Wan from 7203 Jedi Defense I, and young Anakin from 7131 Anakin&#39;s Podracer. &nbsp;Naturally these two minifigs look way better in this set, except for the fact that Obi Wan doesn&#39;t come with any hair. &nbsp;I imagine this has to do with his unique hair cut in Episode I, but it seemed like kind of a rip off in my eyes.</p>

<p>Watto&nbsp;was definitely a minifig I was looking to get my hands on, and I must say he looks great and very film accurate. &nbsp;The only problem I have with Episode I sets (and minifigs) is that many of the characters introduced in that film were systematically killed off or never appeared again, due to the 10 year gap between Episodes I and II. &nbsp;Watto has a brief appearance in Episode II, but he really only fits in with Episode I sets (which I don&#39;t own that many of), so he sits next to this set, hoping for a Watto&#39;s&nbsp;Shop kit to come around...</p>

<p>Wald is yet another Episode I fringe character that I will probably never see a use for outside of displaying with this set. &nbsp;I always wondered why George Lucas didn&#39;t make this young Rodian&nbsp;Greedo instead, as it would have made Episode I slightly more interesting. &nbsp;He looks good enough compared to his film counterpart, but he only has like 1 minute of screen time.</p>

<p>Sebulba is probably the most interesting minifig here, considering the fact that he doesn&#39;t have a single regular minifig piece on him. &nbsp;I figure that if Lego hadn&#39;t released him with the Tatooine&nbsp;Planet set, more people would have been more pressed to get him. &nbsp;It isn&#39;t too hard to balance Sebulba&nbsp;on his hind legs, and his printing is VERY accurate to the film. &nbsp;It never occurred to me as a kid, but how in the world could this guy ever have an actual hatred and rivalry towards a ten year old slave boy? &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The build was very interesting to me, as both podracers are worlds apart in design, size and color. &nbsp;Anakin&#39;s&nbsp;podracer is small and nimble, and naturally the build was as well. &nbsp;Unlike the 1999 version of this vehicle, the fins don&#39;t fall off all of the time and are well secured. &nbsp;Sebulbas pod was probably twice as fun to build, and had a mixture of technic and standard building for the big turbines powering his monstrous pod.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>Both pods come with identical stands, which are great for display or sliding across the carpet. The set is a little hard to display unless you have a shelf with considerable width, and you might find that together the pods take up a lot of precious display room as well. &nbsp;I also might add that separating the two pods would be like splitting Abbott and Costello.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>This set brings back fond memories of cheering Anakin on during the Mos Espa&nbsp;Podrace in my pajamas, and it also gives me good memories in that I saved $35.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>5 new-ish minifigures</p>

<p>Great for display</p>

<p>Rare colors and pieces</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong> New versions of Watto and Sebulba&nbsp;are great with their details.

<p>This set is one of the unique LEGO Star Wars vehicles from The Phantom Menace. I really enjoy this set as a whole.</p>

<h2>Price:</h2>

<p>For $90, you get Anakin&#39;s Podracer (The 2019 set is $30), which means that Sebulba&#39;s podracer is pretty much $60. I would probably give this a $79.99 price point at the time, but since sets are overpriced these days, $90 would work. I picked up this set in 2018 for $124 (Brand New, Sealed)</p>

<h2>Playability:</h2>

<p>This set lacks playability features. The only feature that caught my attention was the hidden tool on subulbas huge &quot;wings&quot;, which you could pull out and &quot;throw&quot; at the other podracer. You are also able to use the &quot;invisible&quot; handels to move around the podracers.</p>

<h2>Display:</h2>

<p>This set was two sand-colored display pieces that lock onto the transparent pieces, which the podracers are connected to. Pretty neat to display, but may look odd from some persectives.</p>

<h2>Minifigures:</h2>

<p>The minifigures include Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Sebulba, Wald, and Watto. A good selection with some figures that are completely unique to the set!</p>

<h2>Overall:</h2>

<p>This is a set that I would recommend more to collectors, rather than kids. This set hasn&#39;t gone up too much in price if you get it used, so take all the time you want to purchase this set.</p>

","<p>So I just picked this up at a garage sale for $30 which is a steal, however if you had to pay retail for this set I would say you are way overpaying. What is deceiving about this set is the brick count since it is divided into 2 builds. At 800+ bricks I expected a large engaging build, however since it is 2 separate builds (plus bases) you are really only getting one small build and one medium build. But let&rsquo;s get into the details.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>A child Anakin is exactly what you would expect. However since he is wearing helmet it kind of limits him to being in a pod racer or a ship unless you go out and get his hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sebulba on the other hand is very cool, nothing standard about any of the bricks that construct him. Furthermore, he looks great, very true to the movie. And he does use his feet (which are combined) as hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Watto&nbsp;like&nbsp;Sebulba&nbsp;is very impressive. While he has a standard body and legs, he is an amazingly detailed head/body piece. It&rsquo;s definitely nice to have him given how important of a role he plays in Episode 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wald seems a little odd choice as he is like an extra in the film, but it&rsquo;s always fun to get an alien, and quite honestly, throw some normal sized legs on him and you have Greedo!&nbsp;</p>

<p>But then you get Obiwan which is a nice minifigure, but he was on the ship the entire time on Tatooine. Quigon&nbsp;would have been much more appropriate, as would Padame or Anakin&rsquo;s mom.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Anakin&rsquo;s</strong> <strong>Pod</strong></p>

<p>So this is the smaller of the two pods, and rightly so. While I didn&rsquo;t count how many bricks it used, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s somewhere in the low 200&rsquo;s. So as you can imagine, the build feels like a 200 piece count set, very simple and not too rewarding. You build this first in the instructions so it kind of left me disappointed as I was expecting something much more complex.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sebulba&rsquo;s</strong> <strong>Pod</strong></p>

<p>At least when you get to Sebulba, his pod is a much more substantial sized build. However, while it adds on bulk, it doesn&rsquo;t differ too much from Anakin&rsquo;s&nbsp;build, it just takes a bit longer. To make matters worse, the 4 wings coming out of the front are practically identical making the build even more repetitive than Anakin&rsquo;s. Because it takes longer to build it is a bit more satisfying, but don&rsquo;t expect it to blow you away, it won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Structure</strong></p>

<p>So this is the cool part of this set, each pod is made of 3 separate parts that float together and have no ability to stand. I think Lego did a tremendous job here through the use of clear technic parts and translucent beams (which I&rsquo;ve only ever seen in gray as details on the Millennium Falcon). The set stays together perfectly, yet has some wobble to it which seems very appropriate. Plus the pod is connected to the engines cosmetically by some very long tubes, the likes of which I&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>

<p>While you may learn something from the structure, due to the specialized bricks and the limited applications for this type of design, it isn&rsquo;t going to be all that useful in building your own MOCs unless you are designing a pod racer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Bases</strong></p>

<p>The model needs to stand and the bases included work very well at balancing these otherwise awkward models. Lego did a great job here. Of course, I complain about this 800+ piece set feeling small and certainly building these two identical bases doesn&rsquo;t help matters.&nbsp;I also would have preferred some sort of built in base that would double as a handle for racing these things around your house. Yes, there kind of is a technic handle at the bottom, but it is small and taking it on and off the base is a bit of a pain. However, since you will need to store Watto, Obiwan, and Wald, the bases act as an excellent stand for them and they do fit below the racers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The models look great and are very accurate to the movie. For this reason I consider it a good set. However the playability is limited to simply flying these around. Anakin&rsquo;s pod has a few moving parts, but no real play features. Sebulba&rsquo;s pod is completely static. Neither pod gives you the satisfying type of build you can typically expect from a larger set. And then you have the stickers, and oh boy are there a lot of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you enjoyed the pod races, and I do think they are probably the most enjoyable part of Episode 1, and you really want to have your own pods, then look for this set at a substantial discount. It&rsquo;s also a nice set for those of you who like to display models. However, if you enjoy the building experience more than anything, then give this set a pass. I fall into this latter group, and let&rsquo;s just say at $30 I think I got what I paid for. It&rsquo;s not my favorite, but I can see my kids enjoying playing with this set when they get older.&nbsp;</p>
