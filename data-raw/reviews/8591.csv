You get 5 minifigs, notably Clone Commander Wolfe( and addition to the already famous Clone Commanders Cody, Fox and Cpt Rex )  Master Yoda, Master Eeth Koth, Master Quinlan Vos and Clone Trooper Wolfpack. Unless you follow closely the Clone Wars series, you will miss the episodes starring the characters mentioned.

You will start off with the initial frame made up of technics. It felt like building another 7675 AT-TE... with the colors grey and maroon red. Right from the start, i felt no awe in the build process... 

There weren't any exciting moments like building a secret compartment or building a contraption. So when i was finished with the foundation, the next process was to fill it up and add the amour layer. This is quite fast.

Once i got to bags 4, 5 and 6.. every thing was a breeze.

Overall, the model is like another replica of the 7665 Republic Cruiser. The frigate in fact is the predecessor model for the Cruiser. And having built the Cruiser, i felt a sense of Deja Vu.  
The underside of the rear portion is empty and hollow. Less for the ""canister"" rocket boosters, its totally flat without detail. Unlike the front and center portion which looks solid and full of volume. 

I am an adult so playability is not so much my concern as i will only have it for display for some time. But i suspect its only good for swooshing around and dropping the escape pod. The aren't enough space to move the Mini figs around. You only get to sit them down and fly the Frigate around. 

UNLESS you are bent on getting and collecting all the Frigates, Cruisers and Destroyers... you can give this set a miss. But the mini figures in this set are a MUST.

"mountainbricks","2011-07-05T16:46:59.957Z","Clone Wars Done Right","<div>I was excited for this set when I first saw photos, because I knew the Episode 1 Republic Cruiser left a lot to be desired. It did not disappoint.</div><div><br></div><div>First off, the minifigs- four brand spankin' new, one rare. Quinlan Vos is one of my favorite Star Wars characters and it was nice to see him added in. His Lego version is pretty spot on- I just wish they had created a hair piece that included his braid, instead of just printing it on his torso. Eeth Koth is a little off; his horns look artificial and out of place, but it's not too bad. Both clone troopers have beautiful printing, and Wolf's missing eye is superb. The Wolfpack trooper even get his own jetpack. Finally, another Yoda is a welcome sight, seeing as he came in only one other set.</div><div><br></div><div>The build itself was very straightforward. It used the same basis as the Republic Cruiser, but with more added features. The landing gear looks better, the center part now drops bombs instead of doing nothing, and instead of that silly rotating shield in the back, there is a gunner's station. The cockpit is improved from last time, as is the escape pod- it sits more minifigs and has a weapons rack. On the inside, there are cargo compartments and a lightsaber rack, plus a hologram of the Emperor.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Even though we all hate flick-fire missiles, the ones in this set blend in nicely. There are some attached to the roof of the cockpit and some in the turret in the back. They look very natural, and work well too (there is nothing to block your fingers when flicking them, which is a problem in other sets).</div><div><br></div><div>The only downside is the piece/price ratio; since the Venator, the $120 Clone Wars sets have dropped in piece count, and this is even lower than the Republic Gunship. However, most all Clone Wars sets have a bad piece/price ratio, so this can be forgiven.</div><div><br></div><div>Here is a very basic pros/cons summary:</div><div><br></div><div>PROS:</div><div>No wasted space: many, many play functions</div><div>Minifigs are new and beautiful</div><div>Flick-fires aren't too bad</div><div>Everything works well, no design flaws</div><div>Much, much improved from its predecessor</div><div><br></div><div>CONS:</div><div>Eeth Koth's horns are a bit odd</div><div>Sticker sheet!</div><div>Bad piece/price ratio</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this is by far the best-quality set from the summer wave. The podracers have a better piece/price ratio, but very few play features. The Falcon has a lot of play features, but its design is flawed. The Republic Frigate is simply the best all-around set from this wave; even if you don't collect Clone Wars sets, this set is great for the minifigs and its appearance. I highly recommend it.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"Bondady","2011-08-03T01:01:15.517Z","The Set and Mini figures we all have been waiting for","Now I started this set ages ago with the version from episode 1. It was okay and I liked it because it came with my favorite jedi, and actor, Quigon Jin, aka Liam Neeson (I hope I spelled that correctly). Now this set brought something new to the table. It was new and updated, great mini figures, and great mini figures. Thats right I said it twice, great Mini figures. I had been waiting for the Commander Wolf Mini figure for ages and now I have him. The set is really just a repeat but modified for war and not diplomacy. So overall it is great. You get another Yoda, although I think he is my 12th. ( =( ) And then there are those other two jedi who we don't know but we don't care we love them none the less. Oh wait one of them was in one clone wars episode and he was a boss. Got to love him all the more then. So over all I would say buy the set because Commander Wolf is there and he won't wait forever. ( If you can't tell, he was the only reason I bought the set. I almost bought two so I could have more of his soldiers but I didn't have the money). This is the Bondady signing off.",FALSE,5,4,4,5,5
"fatalleader","2011-07-08T12:35:44.377Z","They call themselves Lego Master Builders?","Ok, so I just got done rebuilding this set on LDD 4 on my computer as the Old Royal (I'm hoping to get Jedi Bounty published this year, althought the Old Royal doesn't appear until book 3), and even with the improvising I had to do, I actually improved the set. The gunner's spot in the back got better exterior seals (but the minifigure can still be put in) and I put different pieces in where the pieces used were inefficient (as in two pieces of the same color where one would be even better and do the same job). This set shows how the Set Designers at Lego are becoming less piece efficient. The piece count for the actual set is 1015, but the finished product on my computer is only 978 pieces, and will be less when they put the pieces I need to fix it up onto LDD. Good thing is, after UVU, I'm hoping to us a 3D Arts degree to get a job with Lego while finishing my engineering degrees.<br>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,5
"arctrooper","2011-11-20T15:33:03.077Z","Awesome","I'll bet that a lot of people bought this set for the minifigs. They bought this set for the wrong reason.<div>Sure, four of the minfigs are brand new and this is yoda's second? set. But the minifigs pale in&nbsp;compassion&nbsp;to the actual set.</div><div><br></div><div>I'll also bet that this set being a re-do of a the old republic cruiser is a major turn-off for a lot of people. I didn't really like that set, but I love this one. They made some great changes.</div><div>Firstly, the set was fun to build. Sometimes these big sets are boring and repetitive, but this one was very interesting. As an aside, I'll say that I looveed the numbered bags. People always complain that it's not fun when the bags are numbered, but then why don't they just open all of them at once and mix 'em up? Jeez, if you like hours of searching for one fricken' piece (something I've done on more than one occasion), that's your choice. Don't ruin it for the rest of us. Just my 2 cents.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, the republic frigate is a lot meatier and sturdier than it looks. You no longer have to pull the cockpit off of the ship to launch the escape pod, and there's a carrying handle (which is more&nbsp;useful&nbsp;than one would think). The turrets and&nbsp;missiles&nbsp;are impressive, a major improvement over the ones the ones that slid out of the old ship. The landing gear is also pretty neat and the gunner's room (for lack of a better word) is spacier than one would think.</div><div><br></div><div>I didn't like the interior. There's not enough room for a clone to stand in any part of the ship with his helmet on, and the main compartment looks&nbsp;unfinished (to LEGO's credit, I couldn't find of a way to improve it). The bombs fall out easily, but I'm not sure why they were that included anyway (frigate, not bomber). I found it annoying &nbsp;that there were only 2&nbsp;wolf pack&nbsp;troopers, because it's really not that impressive when you have 2 troopers in a unit. Also, actual pilots and gunners would have been amazing.</div><div><br></div><div>All-in-all, the republic frigate was great. Something looks slightly off when you put it next to the Venator (probably scale) but again, it doesn't bother me that much. I liked &nbsp;this set so much i got two, something I never do. It's great.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Jon_Brick","2012-12-23T02:20:09.71Z","A fine addition to the Star Wars line.","<div><b>A brief disclaimer:</b> This is my first review in several years and my first as a AFOL so please don't be too hard on me.</div><div><br></div>After trying to find it on sale since it was released&nbsp;I finally got this set a few months back. Once I did acquire it I was not disappointed. One thing I've noticed with the Clone Wars theme so far is that there haven't been any command bases/centers released in sets yet aside from the very large ships (such as the venator and now malevolence) so it's nice to have a base of commands for the republic forces.<div><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Parts:</b> There are not many special parts in the Republic Frigate but those that are unique stand out with pride. With a mix of standard and Technic, most of the parts are dark red or some shade of grey with the occasional odd colour. The large half cone and curved wall element that help form the detachable pod below the cockpit as well as the engines are the most&nbsp;noticeable unique&nbsp;pieces but the small, round, transparent blue brick that serves as a hologram is by far one of the most interesting non-minifigure based pieces in the set and one of the neatest released in the entire Star wars line.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Building Experience:</b> The first thing I noticed while building this set was that it took me much longer than I'd anticipated. Whether this is due to the sets construction appearing deceptively easy or my considerable amount of time since my last large construction I do not know. Either way this build took around two and a half hours including the time it took to undo a few mistakes. The construction process itself was a repetitive at times but not mind-numbingly so, as the interior and functions of the two center sections were different. It was interesting to build with some, admittedly limited, SNOT (Studs Not On Top) Techniques. The most enjoyable part of the build came when working on the amply sized and spaced drop pod at the front and the two center sections. Working on the different components of these one at a time and then bringing them together has been one of my favourite building experiences to date.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Playability:</b> There is certainly a great potential for vast amounts fun. Probably the most playable function in this set is the detachable troop pod which is one of the coolest I've seen in any Clone Wars set and provided me with much entertainment and a chance for the republic army to send reinforcements. The control and hologram display center on the right side of the ship are also a welcome inclusion to the set allowing those onboard to communicate with republic forces located elsewhere. The left section of the ship serves mainly as storage and space for the bomb-dropping mechanism and isn't to interesting but can easily be modified. Though it feels like TLC could've done more in the left section I don't feel too cheated as the set already contains some pretty neat features. The pilot and gunner areas located at the front and back are pretty standard with nothing really notable about them.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b>&nbsp;Almost all the figures in this set are new and (over a year and a half later) exclusive and while Eeth Koth could have been better and Quinlan Vos is a bit weird the superb detailing on the Wolfpack clone as well Commander Wolffe and his face make the figures a worthy inclusion to this set.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Value for Money:</b>&nbsp;Though I got this on sale, something anyone looking to buy this set should do, I gave my brick rating based on the standard listed price as this set isn't really worth it unless purchased at a reduced price.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Verdict:</b>&nbsp; <b>Buy it on sale.&nbsp;</b>Though this set is very good, the list price deals a massive blow to the rating and only makes this set worthwhile if bought on sale.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3

It has four minifigures that's only been released in this set. I don't like how Quinlan vos hair is on the chestplate. The hair is better on Eeth Koth, where the hair is not on the chestplate. The third minifigure in this set is Yoda. Hi isn't so rare, but this one has grey hair, and the one in the AT-RT has white hair. I like this Yoda. The fourth minifigure is Clone commander wolffe. He got nice armour, and i like how he only got 1 eye and beard. And the fifth minifigure, the last one, is wolfpack clone trooper. It has nice armour and a jetpack.

"Nuruodo","2015-10-26T21:16:31.67Z","Well reproduced frigate from Clone Wars","<p>I really wanted this set when it came out, and I decided to spent more then 100&euro; for it because it wasn&#39;t just a good reproduction of the Republic frigate, but because it appeared very well made. And so it was.</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>I still got the box, which I use to keep smaller sets. It&#39;s very big and capacious, and the Frigate&#39;s image is very attractive.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It has a lot of half-cylindrical parts, used for reactors and escape pod. It also got a lot of dark red pieces, and sticks as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are, except Yoda, all unique: I loved&nbsp;Wollffe and the Wolfpack, who appear in&nbsp;<em>The Clone Wars</em>&nbsp;(Wollffe has a white eye as in the TV series); the Jedis are the most common ones, because Eeth Koth and Quinlan Vos doesn&#39;t appear in many sets (I don&#39;t remember if this is the only one). All them are very accurate.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very long but not boring. Because it hasn&#39;t wings, it wasn&#39;t as&nbsp;repetitive as other starfighters. I especially liked building the cockpit and the escape pod, as I can remember.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is very impressive. Long and heavy, it&#39;s a pearl confronted to starfighters. All turrets can rotate, escape pod can be released, also missiles can be launched... It can be enjoyed a lot and it&#39;s also easy to be moved, fact that surprised me.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like many things of this set. I still enjoy it a lot, and minifigures are very nice. About the price... I think it was worth the cost, although it&#39;s however a large expense. I&#39;m disappointed just by the proportions: in Star Wars universe the dimensions are, obviously, different. I don&#39;t like, in this cruiser like in all the other ones, the fact that minifigures are too big related to them: the bridge has it&#39;s windows tall just 1, and it should host about 2/4 people; so why it hosts just a clone trooper who exceeds the windows in height?</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Very likely aspect and huge dimensions</p>

<p>&ndash; Easy to move althought its weight and lenght</p>

<p>&ndash; Full of details, reactors very well done</p>

<p>&ndash; Turrets can rotate and are realistic</p>

<p>&ndash; Storage rooms inside</p>

<p>&ndash; Rare minifigures</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; High price (although it&rsquo;s worth it in my opinion)</p>

<p>&ndash;&nbsp;Disproportioned</p>

<p>&ndash; Rear turret has a bad looking cockpit</p>

"Galaxy12_Import","2018-04-26T00:34:17.32Z","Hurrah for large spacecraft!","<p>Even though it isn&#39;t the iconic red craft that introduces us to Episode I, the Republic Frigate adds volume and interest to any Star Wars collection. I find its size the most attractive feature and it is a blast to cruise around with the retractable&nbsp;handle on top. The figures included are a nice mix of clone troopers and Jedi, with the Clone Wars version of Yoda a choice addition. Playability is boosted by the cockpit, gunner seat, and bomb-dropping function. It comes loaded with firepower but also looks great with a bottom-mounted gunner station&nbsp;that I added aftermarket.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a great set, if not slightly pricey, but the hulking front end has been valiently&nbsp;leading my fleet since 2011.</p>
