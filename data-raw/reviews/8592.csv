"Quietelk","2011-06-05T23:39:24.407Z","The most film-accurate Falcon yet.. from the outside","<p>The only thing you want to know about this set is this: is it better than 4504? The 2004 model is currently the definitive minifig-playable Millennium Falcon. Can the 2011 model compete?</p><p><br></p><p>Well, yes, it competes very well indeed. If you grab a pic of 4504, one of 7965 and one of the actual Star Wars film miniature Falcon and put them in a lineup, you'll see that 7965 goes to some lengths to match the film Falcon as closely as possible. Little tan/dark red greebles are positioned exactly where the Falcon has her battle scars, and the detailing where the ""mandible"" (the triangular bits that stick out the front) and the ""saucer"" (main hull) meets is cleverly done to match the ""real"" Falcon.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically comparing 4504 to 7965 really comes down to what you think is important in a set. 7965 has more pieces (1200+ vs 985). 4504 has an escape capsule and a MUCH cooler Hyperdrive. 7965 has crew berth areas so you can recreate Luke's recovery at the end of Empire. 4504 has controls in the laser turret room in the centre, but 7965 has a funny sort of sledge thing that lets you put Luke and Han in the turret together... plus 7965 has a bottom turret.</p><p><br></p><p>Early criticisms speak to 7965's large and empty interior. Well, again it depends on what's important to you. The training drone and grey helmet are very cool, as is Luke's ""visor down"" alternate face. There's still a secret compartment and a boarding ramp. And lots of space means lots of capacity for modding. Come on - does Lego have to do EVERYTHING? :)</p><p><br></p><p>The decision to add in a Darth Vader but leave out the droids and the Snowtrooper with cannon is pretty much six-of-one, half-a-dozen of the other. And the cockpit (where Chewie has to sit sort of behind Han) is almost identical to 4504, though the way it connects to the saucer is much better.</p><p><br></p><p>The minifig mix speaks to this being a Star Wars IV Falcon, not an Empire Strikes Falcon like 4504. Luke and Obi Wan are along for the ride, in their desert robes. And we assume the Falcon ALWAYS had crew berths, even though they only appear in Empire... heh.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of the day, 7965 has a more film-accurate external look, a slightly sparser interior (even though it has more play zones, and of course lots of room for modding), and takes advantage of a number of newer SNOT techniques.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The only awkward bit is a compromise on rigidity - there's a large technic beam that runs along under the cockpit. It means the model is solid and zoomable (albeit with two hands) at the cost of a slightly odd profile when looking at the cockpit side-on.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh and the price. It's Star Wars Lego so of course it's right up there on price-per-piece. In Australia this retails for a mind-breaking $250 (that's US$268 in June 2011!), or about $100 more than other sets with this many pieces. Such is life.</p><p><br></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(173, 24, 8); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 18px; "">Pros</span></p>

Hopefully, I will post some photos.</span></p><p><font size=""3"" face=""Times New Roman""></font>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Very sturdy for wooshing.</li><li>The roof sections hold together much better than older falcon models and allow some upside down wooshing.</li><li>The top detail is the most movie accurate other than the UCS falcon.</li><li>Cockpit fits 2 minifigs.</li><li>Great interior for kids who like the star wars films.</li><li>A lot of floor space and easy to mod.</li><li>Almost a complete set of episode 4 falcon minifgs.</li><li>Top and bottom turrets.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

"captain_radda_radda","2011-08-16T22:00:35.36Z","Truly Incredible","<p>I am a die hard fan of the original triligoy...but I never owned any form of the Falcon! I always thought the previous models were too inaccurate and simply downgraded to fit the price range. The same simply cannot be said about this incarnation. This set is incredible. It is a piece of plastic art fit for any and every Star Wars collection. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Build</p>
<p>I usually don't mention the build, but the build on the Falcon is something I've never seen before. You start from the bottom and work your way up. You then build the interior and eventually fill in the sides. The techniques are unconventional and make the build that much more entertaining. It took roughly 2 hours. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Set</p>
<p>This set is enormous. It is one of the biggest sets I own (next to the At-At) and is extremely detailed. The beds, probe droid, game table and comuputer all fit in perfectly and add to the movie accuracy of the model. It has excellent ""chipping"" detail as well, since red tiles and exposed grills are placed appropriately throughout the exterior. It includes two turrets and flick fire missles as weapons. Surprisingly, the missles add to the details and actually increase the awesomeness of this set. The landing gear does not retract, but this is not a bad thing. The set is heavy, therefore it would be a pain to deploy the for legs with one hand while balancing the Falcon on the other. It would be disasterous! The figs are great. Leia is a welcome edition to the cast of refurbished characters, and Luke seems to keep improving. Han is awesome, especially since he has jeans! Chewie and Vader are nothing special. Obi-Wan is actually welcome, since he includes a cape, which is genuinely rare. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Closing Thoughts</p>
<p>This set is truly amazing. It is by far one of the best Star Wars sets ever released and is definitely true to the movies. This is honestly the first ""must-have"" of 2011. If you're a kid and can only get one ""big"" set this year, get it! If you're an adult and don't want to splurge on a toy, do it! This set is actually worth more than its tag price, as it is beautiful and a centerpiece to any Star Wars collection. I garuantee you: you will love this beauty!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is fairly large when you first see it but after a while it doesn't seem that big. The instructions are in two books, and sandwiched beetween is the sticker sheet.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are good with some rarer parts but the pieces are anything special yet..<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>The minifigs are WOW, new Luke, Han and Leia. First off, lukes new hair is much better than the old be his head really lets him down, he looks angry for some reason. Han is better as the new head looks good. Same with the legs. Leia hasn't changed much but better than the old version. The rest are good, but Ben could have come with some grey hair. He would have looked better.<br>
<h4>The build</h4>Very good, some parts are a bit repetitive but other than that great! The build is totally different to the 4504 by far. You first make a frame, panel it and add details. After you start working on the sides, the front and top. From here you get a real sense of how big it will be. Add the cockpit and done!<br><h4>The completed model</h4><p>Exterior is really accurate with moving guns, cockpit etc but the inside is ok. Could be better. The hyperdrive is not as good as the 4504. Modification time!<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall really good, but lacking on the inside. I rate it: 9/10</p><p>Great exterior, not good interior.

"jscutt","2012-01-02T17:00:48.173Z","Awesome set of my favourite Star Wars ship","<p>I missed all other versions of the falcon as I've only just got back into Lego with the help of my 4 year old son. This was a present from my wife for Christmas, we managed to pick it up from Amazon earlier in the year for £89.</p><p><br></p><h4>Initial impressions</h4><p>First thing that I noticed was the weight of the box, we've amassed quiet a large&nbsp;collection&nbsp;of sets including several larger ones, this is&nbsp;definitely one of the largest and heaviest. A lot of bags of grey&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;greet you when opening the box, two lovely big&nbsp;instruction&nbsp;books and a sticker sheet (unfortunately ours was bent beyond use).</p><p><br></p><h4>Build</h4><p>I managed to squeeze the build out over several evenings, my son&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;normally like to wait for his sets so when it's mine I like to enjoy it. And the build was good, not one of the most exciting because of a few&nbsp;repetitive sections but overall nice seeing the iconic shape come together. In the end it took maybe 3 hours to build, the&nbsp;inaccurate proportions&nbsp;don't&nbsp;bother me and I think Lego has done a great job with the set.</p><p><br></p><h4>Mini Figures</h4><p>Mini figures are a little&nbsp;disappointing, just because we already had most of them from other sets. Like the new hair&nbsp;piece for Luke and Leia, but overall I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;know what Lego could have done&nbsp;differently&nbsp;other than replace&nbsp;Vader&nbsp;with 3PO and R2.</p><p><br></p>

"ScruffyBamboo","2012-01-06T11:14:19.283Z","""...she made the Kessel run in less than twleve parsecs!""","<p>I recenlty received the new Millenium Falcon as a Christmas gift, and built it last weekend.&nbsp; Here are my impressions of this great set:</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>It's a nice box.&nbsp; I don't really care about boxes.&nbsp; I have no room to keep them, so they get tossed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The instructions (3 booklets)&nbsp;didn't come in a clear bag with a cardboard backing, which is unfortunate, because they were a bit bent out of shape.&nbsp; Not a big deal, but I really wish Lego would add the carboard backing to all their larger sets - there's just too much chance of mangling.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Do you like grey parts?&nbsp; Lots and lots of grey parts?&nbsp; Do you like angled ""wing"" parts?&nbsp; Then this is your set.&nbsp; While there aren't too many ""unique"" pieces as such, what you do get is an amazing selection of parts to build your own MOC ships.&nbsp; There are some stickers (which I don't usually use), but they are very ""generic"" (i.e. grills, etc.) and are therefore very re-usable in MOCs.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>A nice set of minifigs, and pretty complete for playing with the Falcon.&nbsp; You get Luke, Han, Obiwan, Chewie and Leia, as well as Darth, for some reason.&nbsp; He's kind of out of place, but you can never have enough Vaders :).&nbsp; The droids are noticeably absent, but they come in so many sets that most SW fans should have a few by now.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>A brilliant build.&nbsp; The model uses tons of SNOT (Studs Not On Top) modelling - all of the ship's sides are built this way.&nbsp; I was wondering how they would look as I was building them, but once it comes time to fit them on the ship, they fit in perfectly, and create a pretty tight ""seal"" (unlike the previous Falcon - 4504 - that had huge holes in the body of the ship).&nbsp; Building all the roof panels gets a bit repetitive, but that's to be expected (and they do try to mix it up a bit).&nbsp; There's a really great Technic base that supports the whole model, and makes it very solid - a good example for anyone wanting to build medium-sized MOC ships.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is a beauty.&nbsp; Obviously not as accurate or impressive as the USC Falcon, but for a ""playable"" Falcon, it's un-matched.&nbsp; First of all, it's incredibly solid.&nbsp; AS long as you grip it in the right place (one of the docking ports), it's infinitely swishable, even upside-down.&nbsp; It looks quite accurate from the outside (the mandibles seem a touch long, though), and there's a nice amount of little details scattered around the hull.  The interior, while obviously not 100% movie-accurate, still has all the main sections from the movies (Nav computer, Holochess table, hidden compartment, entrance ramp, etc.) The cockpit is a bit dissapointing - not only does it not really connect to the rest of the ship, but you can't really fit two minifigs in it (let alone 4).&nbsp; The engine is a bit underwhelming, consisting of a single bluish tube stretched around the back of the ship.  Finally, the ship looks a little strange from the side - the top is proberly angled, but the bottom is flat, so it looks off.&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are nit-picks, and this is still&nbsp;one of the better-looking models in the Lego Star Wars Universe.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a great ship.&nbsp; If you're a Star Wars fan, especially of the original trilogy, this is THE iconic ship to have.&nbsp; Even people who know almost nothing about Star Wars will recognize the Millenium Falcon.&nbsp; There's more screen time spent aboard this ship than any other.&nbsp; While it might be a bit pricey, this is a set you don't want to miss.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4

"legoreviewer266","2011-11-20T03:03:23.38Z","Iconic Star Wars model!","<p><strong>Build:</strong> This is&nbsp;probably one of the coolest sets I've built so far. It's fun, engaging and when you're building it, it just feels like you're in that scene from the movie. It's not repetitive or difficult. The age that it shows on the box is pretty accurate, except maybe 10 or 11 to 14, instead of 9. 9 is just kind of pushing it and they would&nbsp;either&nbsp;stuff up&nbsp;or they might need a parents help. The set roughly took me 4 hours to build... not too bad for a set with 1238 pieces, although it did have numbered bags. The thing that kind of felt strange, was how this set has stickers and printed pieces, they could of just gone with all printed or&nbsp;at least&nbsp;majority... and I know this is not the only set that has that problem, but it's just annoying how they keep doing that, especially considering this set&nbsp;is&nbsp;$140US and we want to get some value out of it, not just having to sit around and throw some random and rather difficult stickers on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mini figures:</strong> You get 6 mini figures in this set. Now before I go any further, I do want to mention that you do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> get R2-D2 and C-3PO, which is kind of lame, especially considering the fact that some scenes are just associated to them, like the space checkers. The figures that you do get though, are; Han, Chew, Leia, Luke, Ben and vader. Now only 3 of them are exclusive and here's why- Luke has a new double-sided face, Leia has a remould hair piece and Han has new leg printing (which is basically just an extra line), but it's not even exclusive, because it's also used in the encyclopedia. So I don't even know why they're counting him as an exclusive mini fig, but it's a mystery. vader is rather rare, as the face that he has with the eye-brow is only in the death star, so I guess that's pretty nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Set:</strong> The set is rather awesome. You get so much detail that's in the movie- such as; the front cockpit (main control room), main computer, space checkers, boarding ramp, smugglers compartment, the droid machine thingo that Luke trains with, engine display, gunner seat, top and bottom turrets, radar dish, landing gears&nbsp;and even the back engine. However, there are some details that were <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> in the movie, such as the beds they included, the cup and the flick-fire missiles. I think the set itself is pretty accurate and I like how you get the choice of putting which figures where you want&nbsp;sort of thing. The problems with some of them are; the main cockpit (main control room)&nbsp;can only seat one mini figure, which is kind of lame, since they never mention that anywhere. The smugglers compartment is very deep, but you can only fit one mini figure and when you do, the figure like <strong><em>always</em></strong> gets stuck. The panels are also really fragile- especially if that's where you're going to grab onto, so&nbsp;I do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> recommend that.&nbsp;To tell you some of the things though, the landing gears are extremely strong and it balances perfectly, considering how small they are. The railing system on the turret works great and I love how you can sit 2 mini figures perfectly without crushing them. The set is just fantastic in&nbsp;every way&nbsp;and lots of ways to react the movie scene with great amount of play space and some really exclusive and awesome mini figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> You should definitely get this set if you can afford it, it's is well worth the money, just make sure you're not buying it for the figures, which is basically what most people tend to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>- Iconic Star Wars model, so much detail and effort put into it</p><p>- Lots of features and play space, great for younger kids</p><p>- The gunner seat is fantastic and you can easily fit 2 minifigures, the railing system also works great</p><p>- Great price for a collectors point of view</p><p>- Really fun to build, not too difficult or repetitive&nbsp;</p><p>- Numbered bags</p><p><br></p><p><b>Cons:</b></p><p>- Could of had a handle, just for easier transportation and since all the ""bigger"" Star Wars vehicles have one</p><p>- Could of had retractable landing gear, just to make it more movie accurate</p><p>- Maybe less stickers and more printed pieces, since this set had like 24 stickers and it's a pretty expensive set</p><p>- Only room for 1 mini figure in the cockpit instead of 2, (like in the movie)</p><p>- No C-3PO or R2-D2 &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
"LuminousBeing","2011-11-28T16:44:44.547Z","An amazing offering from Lego","<p><strong>Wonderful Birthday Present!</strong></p>
<p>I have decided that my fiance is amazing for yet another reason as I opened set 7965 for my birthday.&nbsp; Having missed out on 4504 several years ago, I was excited to hear that Lego would again be producing this iconic ship at the minifig scale.&nbsp; In comparing this ship to its earlier incarnations, I am pleased to see some of the scaling issues resolved as well as improvements in overall integrity which enhances the ships playability.</p>
<p>Out of the box, the contents can be a bit overwhelming.&nbsp; Lego's new instruction format as well as numbering the bags made it much simpler to organize for what will most likely be a 3-4 hour undertaking (if you are old and easily fatigued by fine motor tasks&nbsp;like I am).&nbsp; Again, Lego has made a sectional roof similar to 4504 which makes for an intricate build.&nbsp; This is a necessity in order to access the awesome inner play areas such as the training area (complete with target and helmet!) the Dejarik holochess board, hyperdrive, com panel, smuggling panel, amongst others.&nbsp; One of the features I appreciated most was the correct movie accurate configuration of the twin blasters Luke and Han use to fend of TIE fighters as they escape the Death Star.&nbsp; Utilizing a ""sled"" (similar to the Imperial Shuttle hold) to place characters in their respective positions, it makes reenacting this vital scene from SW IV even better!&nbsp; </p>
<p>At first I was confused at the minifig offerings in this set.&nbsp; No droids? Darth Vader? No Storm Troopers?</p>
<p>It is meant to be the MF ship which is taken aboard the first Death Star near Yavin. You have the option to stage the duel between Obi Wan and Darth Vader while Luke and company attempt to blast their way out of the Death Star's bay. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Structural Integrity 
<li>Interior and exterior detail 
<li>Movie Accuracy 
<li>Excellent configuration of angles/dimensions (I checked it against&nbsp;The Empire Strikes Back&nbsp;and they are nearly congruent!)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Stickers 
<li>Non retracting landing gear- although improved from 4504 
<li>Minifig offering sans droids 
<li>Propulsion system lacking detail

<p><strong>To conclude, </strong>this set is quite astounding.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the days of printed bricks is likely over, but this set still feels like its at an appropriate price point.&nbsp; Adding a few minifigs may have helped, but thats no a deal-breaker.

"Toa_of_Protodermis","2012-05-01T06:03:29.933Z","Legen, and wait for it... dary!","After years of collecting only Bionicle sets, I'm actually just starting to appreciate the real state of the art Lego sets. This is one of them. I think one problem with my reviews is that I'm buying only the most outstanding sets, and therefore they get only highest ratings. The Millenium Falcon is definitely the biggest and best lego set I own. Being an AFOL it's hard for me to rate it's playability, but it's got really a lot of great minifigures, and the interior really resembles one from the movies, so I guess no kid would deny it's value in this matter. However, what I can appreciate and rate fairly is building experience. The only set I can compare it to is my Venator. It's similar in piece amount, but definitely the Republic destroyer is less fun to build. Why, You ask? Well, the bags in Millenium Falcon are numbered, while Venator's aren't. It makes building experience less tiring. One more reason is that MF is not a symmetrical structure, which makes building less repetitive. What I don't like are the stickers. Ok, let's point out the pros and cons.<br><br>Pros:<br>-Lots of pieces<br>-Great minifigures<br>-Accurate to movie counterpart (inside and outside)<br>-Numbered bags (I know it's standard these days, but Venator didn't have those so...)<br>-Non symmetrical building<br>-Sturdy construction (comparing rather to some older sets, like 6982 Explorien Starship)<br><br>Cons:<br>-STICKERS <br>-High price<br>-It's lacking some important characters like C3-PO or R2-D2.<br>-Darth Vader misses his Stormtroopers<br><br>Objectively cons, but I really don't care about those:<br>-Cockpit could have a better way to open<br>-Little white compartment on the back of the ship is to small to contain anything but a lightsaber handle<br>-'hideout' compartment is a little bit small. One minifigure hardly fits in.<br>-Twin tables on the back, those with Racers rims on them, are a bit loose<br><br>Oh and by the way, have I mentioned that I really don't like flick-fire missiles?<br>Summarizing, I strongly recommend this set to any Lego fan. If You check out my account You'll se I've got some experience in building Space theme sets, but this Millenium Falcon is better than anything I've ever displayed on my shelf.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>Hopefully it's being recycled into a nice tree at the moment but I generally don't care about the box. &nbsp;It's a pretty big box, and it was full, unlike the other Lego sets with big boxes but not a lot of content inside.</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions were pretty clear, although it was falling apart by the time we took it out of the box. &nbsp;Case of the bad stapling. &nbsp;Some of the stickers also came off and was stuck to the instruction booklet. &nbsp;Maybe it was just our box that had a particularly rough time.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>I made the kids sort them before the build so it was pretty easy to navigate. &nbsp;There were a lot of pieces...</div><div><br></div><div>I know Lego usually slips some extra pieces into its sets for spare parts but it really threw us off this time. &nbsp;The extra pieces in our box were pretty big pieces, like 1x4 and 2x3 bricks. &nbsp;We thought we messed up and neglected some steps so we backtracked carefully only to find that we did follow all the steps. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Pretty cool figures, two capes. &nbsp;I don't really like the capes, not because of the Incredibles but because the minifigures don't sit properly with the capes in the way.</p><p>Luke Skywalker also has the alternate hair/helmet piece for when he's a pilot and when he's not. &nbsp;That was cool. &nbsp;I liked how the minifigures were in the first bag, and you get all six in the first go.</p>
<h4><br></h4><h4>The build</h4><p>Pretty cool, the steps weren't as repetitive as I thought it would be. &nbsp;We should have followed the instructions and built it on a table or at least a hard surface. &nbsp;Trying to manipulate and press the foundation together on carpet was not cool at all. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Seriously for this set, build it on a table!</p>

"AT_AT_Driver","2012-05-15T04:29:20.927Z","Disappointing for the collector","I wonder, why everyone likes this set. It's maybe okay, if you don't have a millenium falcon. But if you follow Lego Star Wars already for a longer period of time like me, you have to say, that this set is no real improvement to 7190 and 4504 and is very disappointing.<div><br></div><div>This set is not bad, you find good stuff in it, but I want to write this review as a collector and a fan of virtuosic building. I'm not satisfied with just spending money for Lego and building up any new thing I can get.</div><div><br></div><div>CONS:<br><div><br></div><div>The way of constructing the hull is nearly the same, as in 4504 done and has still the same flaws. There is very much space between the bricks, it's hard to imagine, that this ship is airtight. And you can't lift the ship, when you hold it at one of the normal roof elements.</div></div><div><br></div><div>The hyper drive engine looks very ugly. It would be better to leave that away instead of making something boring which just looks like some kind of engine.</div><div><br></div><div>It's no big effort to build today a landing gear, which you don't have to snap off. It's already done for a lot of other Star Wars spaceships, why not for the Millenium Falcon?</div><div><br></div><div>The smuggling compartment has a very disadvantaged place in the ship. It's hard to reach under a roof, which can't be folded up.</div><div><br></div><div>They tried to increase the level of detail on the one hand, but on the other hand, they made the terrible mistake to shorten the mandibles, as said before.</div><div><br></div><div>And, me too, I hate sickers and flick-fire.</div><div><br></div><div>PROS:</div><div><br></div><div>I agree with reviewers before: It's good that Lego tried to make more scenes of the film possible. The helmet and Luke's Head for the jedi training look very good. The place of Han and Leia, the bigger control computer, vertical gun seats are okay.</div><div><br></div><div>In contrast I have to say, that two minifigures fit very well into the cockpit. Not four, but that's not possible in this size and no problem. The same way as in 4504 and it's good to see that the cockpit now is fixed.</div><div><br></div><div>No escape pod is good news, but they just left something away in this point. The smuggling compartment which comes for it, was already found in 7190 and was better done there. And in theory the Falcon had escape pods some time ago?</div><div><br></div><div>It's just a VERY SMALL development.</div><div><br></div><div>WANTS:</div><div><br></div><div>The grey and sad interior is still far away from the movies. It's clear that the Millenium Falcon must be undersized, when constructed as a playset. There is no sense in complaining about that. I would rather prefer a small falcon with separated rooms inside, a better structure for the interior like in 7190. This should be the strength of a playset, not the outer level of detail, because it's not a model, not a UCS-Version. I would be amazed by a Lego Millennium Falcon where the cockpit is finally linked to the rest of the ship.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I would like to see more interesting content and new techniques instead of simple details on the outside. 7190 had less pieces but was much better inside. I would prefer, I admit simple, stable big parts for a sturdy hull instead of weak construction in maybe the right shape. Walls in the interior could be used as a strong base for plating above and so on. This gives the chance to build something of more complexity and virtuosity at other places, for example the interior link to the cockpit, an exit to the top (like Lando used), compartments in the side walls, landing gear or other stuff.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion I want to say that Lego could have done more in six or seven years after 4504. Somehow, the first Falcon is still the best (even without talking about the awesome design of instructions and box in the early years) because the interior didn't improve until now. Lego didn't show much skill with this release.</div>",TRUE,2,2,1,3,3

"Chills","2012-05-11T13:19:26.823Z","Fun build for an iconic Star Wars ship","<p>Few ships in the Star Wars universe get as much screen time or are as iconic as the Millennium Falcon. LEGO has made a few versions of this set so far, and I've not had the opportunity to build them, so this review won't reference the other sets. That being said I think LEGO did a really good job designing this set.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: Since the Falcon is such a Star Wars icon the designers have a lot to live up to, and they made a great set. You are really taken back to the movies with this set, it is packed with little features that remind of scenes from the movies.<br></li><li>Pro 2: Features include the boarding ramp, dual cannons and the access tube between them, the sensor dish, headlights on the mandibles, hidden compartment, game table, the practice remote droid, and even a highly detailed work station in the middle. There's even the spot where Han and Leia share their first kiss, a nice addition.<br></li><li>Pro 3: The minifigures included are pretty cool. I like this version of Luke with the blast shield over his face, and Han and Leia are unique. Good additions to your collection. Chewie and Vader are pretty standard, so you likely already have these two. Obi-wan isn't in many sets, but its cool he was in this one.</li><li>Pro 4: The build was a lot of fun. There were some repetitious parts when you build the sides and the top sections, but they went by quickly. And there are unique parts to them so it doesn't feel like you're building the same thing over and over.</li><li>Pro 5: There's a lot of playability with this set. LEGO did a nice job designing a way to have ""swooshability"" along with being able to open the ship up and play inside.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The first thing I noticed that I would change is the sparse interior. There are nice details inside, but when you get to the back (engine compartment and sleeping quarters) it looks like LEGO just left it half-finished. I would have put walls around the beds and the engine room to section them off.<br></li><li>Con 2: The cockpit isn't easy to get on and off for the figures. Its tricky to get them in and out, especially if you're trying to put both Han and Chewie in there at the same time.</li><li>Con 3: I would have omitted the Darth Vader minifigure and added the droids. Vader never was on the Falcon, but the droids were quite often.</li><li>Con 4: Stickers, there are a lot of them on this set so be ready.<br></li></ul>
<p>Looking at this set I can't help but smile. It is a great design (minus a few points) and was a lot of fun to build. It's solid, so you can move it around, and has a lot of features from the movies. My wife tells me I have too many Imperials so it's good to have a good-guy ship, and what says ""good guys"" more than the Falcon? This is a definite ""must-have"" for any Star Wars fan.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4
"zipsforbananas","2012-07-28T18:56:00.12Z","The rebel flagship has arrived","<p>I've a feeling this Falcon will last. There's simply no contest comparing it to the 2000 4-piece hull version; I've never understood how that was allowed to see the light of day, it's so poor!</p><p>It is essentially the same as <b>4504</b> from 2004, but please don't listen if someone tries to tell you they are no different. The basic premise of how to build the ship has remained the same, but virtually every other detail is changed, and is far better: the structure is Technic and is stronger, especially the legs; the hull plates are fixed better; hull detailing is more accurate and intricate; there are more, and better minifigures (although I wouldn't have minded fewer figures and a more accessible price!); quite a few elements are completely different, the roof to the cockpit, the boarding ramp, and the front bit that stops between the mandibles; and though the hyperdrive isn't as spectacular it wasn't in the films so it was an imagining and I personally prefer the more discrete version.</p><p>And though I may shock many I think this is also far better than the <b>UCS</b>. Yes, the UCS may actually be better minifigure scale, but even this version is verging on looking too big compared to other vehicles. And perhaps the UCS is perfectly movie accurate, but the large sections that are hinged plates look far better with the slopes available to this smaller scale model. I like my Lego Star Wars to look like Lego, as well as Star Wars, and this version is a perfect Lego rendition of a movie accurate Falcon, I would say more so that the UCS. So sue me! :D<br><br>Anway, on to <b>the actual ship</b>. I'll start with the <b>negatives</b> to get them out of the way because I've got quite a few to mention, but I'm not sure any of them matter all that much!</p><p>The feet are quite short and don't let the boarding ramp come down very far (and being really picky there are too few of them!); but they are very strong and as they're short they don't look odd when you're swooshing.</p><p>The bottom of the ship is dreadful too, and I mean properly dreadful! There is no effort at all to make it look good, or match the top side, and it even intrudes onto the top view below the cockpit which is a shame; but as I said, it is very strong, and if I'm already bothered by the price why am I asking for more pieces? :P It looks great from above!</p><p>I'm a bit disappointed by the flooring in the ship too, in that the joins aren't reinforced at all, but again that would mean more pieces.</p><p>And the stickers are an issue, in that most of them are circular and so are extremely awkward to get well centred and straight. I don't mind stickers, but Lego could have helped a little couldn't they?</p><p><br></p><p>On to the <b>positives</b>! And there are <i>a lot</i> of these!</p><p>First, and most obviously, she's beautiful! The greebling round the outside ring is great, the bits of 'rust' on the hull plates are fantastic, and overall it's got that 2009 classy compact vibe I keep going on about in my reviews! The guns look good top and bottom, and where the cockpit joins the body it's handled really well and looks fantastic.</p><p>The interior is no exception either, and though it may look a little sparse it gives lots of space for figures acting out scenes, or extra bits you can add yourself. The ""chess"" board is still cool and has more seats round; the training droid is cute; the beds are fun too, and not so un-filmical if &nbsp;you recreate the end of Empire with them; the little bit that I think is meant to be where Han and Leia kiss is a bit too small; and the best bit is the console - it's huge, with blue bits too! The cockpit is as good as size allows, and fits two if you sit one a stud further back. And the sled for sitting gunners in the central hole is really funky, and even though you can't see it when the top is on you imagine it works well!</p><p>She's great fun to build, really well laid out with the different bags, and takes a good long while so you finish it with a good sense of ownership and achievement. Structurally, so long as you don't grip the parts that you should know are flimsy from building it, it won't fall apart when swooshing it. Granted, there aren't many safe places, but the ship is a bit too heavy for swooshing anyway. The main play aspect is the opening hull and using that great interior. I'm an AFOL, I try my hardest not to play with my Lego for respectability's sake! But you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference when I'm arranging the dioramas. If it gets me playing then it must have good playability -&nbsp;irresistible&nbsp;in fact!</p><p>Features don't abound, beyond the rotatable dish and guns, the accessible interiors, and a few inexplicable flick-fires (Lego do love them!) there isn't much. Although now I think of it the boarding ramp and smuggling compartment count too, even if the ramp doesn't go down too far and the compartment doesn't fit much in. Again, it's the playability of the interior that gives the ship full marks in this department.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the <b>minifigures</b>. 2012 saw an explosion in the quality of Star Wars minifigure detailing, and this set was very much the precursor.</p><p>Vader and Chewie are as they have been for a while, and this set, like quite a lot of the ships, is about the scene so Vader is quite appropriate, along with Obi-Wan in his duel getup. Who complained about Han, Leia and Chewie with the 2006 X-Wing, and the snowtroopers with the last Falcon? You can act out everything from blasting out of Mos Eisley up to knocking Vader off Luke's tail with this set!</p><p>The Leia isn't so different to previous Episode IV versions, just with a bit more lipstick and an alternate face. Han isn't all that different to previous versions either, but he's an absolutely perfect New Hope rendering. Obi-Wan is also just a few tweaks off the Landspeeder version, but again he's spot on for the duel with Vader with the hood and cape.<br>The winner this time is Luke. I absolutely love his hair - waaaaay better than the girl's hair from the Landspeeder! His frowning face has all the anger of seeing old Ben chopped down, and the printing on the back for training ""with the blast visor down"" is wonderful, even if does mean you have to take his hair off!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Outstanding looks</li><li>Playability of that massive and (mostly) brilliantly rendered interior</li><li>Sturdy, so long as you don't pick it up the wrong way</li><li>Excellent figures, especially Luke</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>What a dreadful underside!</li><li>Awkward stickers.</li></ul>
<p>I suppose the ship could be a little better, but not without adding another load of bricks, and hence inflating the price. What you get is absolutely fantastic, and I couldn't recommend it more. I'd have liked £30 off the price, but I wouldn't like all that much chopped, and the value per piece is actually really good so I can't complain as I can't see what Lego can do to make it better. It is a chunk of money, but it's good value too, and a real must have for any collection.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

"HikerCZ","2013-03-20T10:40:40.18Z","Millenium Falcon - do we need another one? ","Every now and then Lego reboots an iconic set, which I personally find nice of them since some of the older sets have exuberant pricing on secondary markets and this is one way of making them accessible for new fans. After probably the best UCS set of the same name, Millennium Falcon returns for those who for any reason didn't feel like spending a small fortune on one set. Although I find UCS intriguing and technically fantastic, I don't buy them not because of the money (though the price tag is hefty) but because they don't fit with the rest of my collection. I think people at Lego know this and this new Falcon fits with other ships perfectly and that was the main reason for me to get it. <br><br>The set obviously pales when compared to UCS, nevertheless, the amount of detail is adequate for this size and the final product looks majestic on its own. Unlike UCS for which you probably have to have a special room, this one sits nicely on a shelf or as I call it the Hoth Echo Base next to my other ships. The design is great and although I'm not a friend of the hull solution - the gaps are far too big - I can live with it. As other people mention, the bottom section is nothing exciting and retractable landing gear would have made it a lot better. The colour scheme is very good, the odd yellow brick as in 2004 is gone. Some people have problems with the empty space inside the ship, however, it's a perfect opportunity to mod as you like, so I have no problems with that. <br><br>The minifigs look great and it's really nice how small tweaks can bring character to these figures. Faces look excellent as well as printings on the torso. The inclusion of Darth Vader seems slightly odd, I agree that there should be droids instead but this is easily fixable if you buy Droid Escape. <br><br>Playability is near perfect, this is something that UCS sets lack and although I'm an adult collector I like to recreate some iconic scenes every now and then. Smuggling compartment, crew quarters, common room, Luke's training, gunners sled are all pure fun. Building is challenging, the side sections were quite repetitive but the manual is clear and it goes rather well. <br><br>Are there any drawbacks? you might ask. Well, like I've said before the gaps between sections are quite big, so I hope there will be a more elegant solution in the future. The mandibles seem a tiny bit smaller than they should be but that is just cosmetics. The biggest problem for me was the application of stickers. I can't stand when my round stickers are not perfectly centred, so you can imagine how much time it took me to apply and reapply all of the 13 round stickers. But as with other sets the days of printed bricks seem to be over. <br><br>Although this is not a cheap set, you'll get plenty of bang for your buck - a great ship, lots of minifigs and great playability. So if this is your first Millennium Falcon, you won't be disappointed and if you find a discounted one, get it at once.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

I bought it and this is a neat set to have in your collection.<br><br>You lift up several tiles to see the inside of the Falcon, which has that chess game (I don't know the proper <i>Star Wars</i> terminology, so forgive me), the little hide-out, which is neat, but unfortunately the bottom part of the hideaway can fall off easily, got beds for the tired crew members, plus you can re-enact the training scene with that droid ball thing (again, forgive me for not knowing the proper terminology. You can also put a couple of the mini-figures inside the sled found in the turrets to have space battles or just cause wanton destruction as well as missiles on the bottom. I have a couple of gripes, like the cockpit area could be a bit bigger so Han and Chewy can both fly and some hinges so you can fit those tools instead of the little box, which they can fall out easily. A little annoying, but there is so much to like about this, those can be forgiven. The outside of it shines as well, as you have the two turrets and missile launchers, plus the satellite dish and the light you see coming out of the back of it. The tiles cover the inside decently. Plus all the markings around is nice detail. Mini-figures include Princess Leia, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Chewbacca and strangely, Darth Vader. Kinda weird addition; just think, you're flying around and you have the Dark Lord of the Sith aboard with you! On the other hand, this set was designed with the Death Star Escape in mind where Obi-Wan fights his former apprentice, so I guess that's no problem. They should have, however, included R2-D2 and C-3PO, otherwise the figures would be perfect. I really like how they did the blasters for Han, Leia and Luke. Very nice detail with those.<br><br>Building-wise, starts off good, though gets a little repetitive in the middle-to-end, but worth it all.<br><br>Definitely a good addition for fans of Lego and <i>Star Wars</i> (or both.)<br>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,5

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-11-06T23:08:01.593Z","If you love Star Wars and Lego you need this set!","<p>So I decided I wanted a Millennium Falcon set. Most of my Legos are from the 80s but now that my son is really into Legos&nbsp;we have a few Star Wars sets and I love playing with them. I don&rsquo;t typically spend more than $20 on a set, but I figured if there was one set worth making an exception on it would be for a Falcon.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Choosing</b> <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b></p>

<p>Of course I had to decide which one I wanted. Currently I can buy the Kessel&nbsp;Run version in stores, and plenty of people are selling them much cheaper through garage sales, but since I&rsquo;m only buying one version, I don&rsquo;t want a version from a single, not-so-great movie with strange colors and some oddball minifigures. So basically it was out of the question.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So it came down to 7965 vs 75105. Both are great but have trade offs. 75105 is much more detailed and looks fantastic, although a lot of the interior detail is just clutter and&nbsp;it&rsquo;s minifigures suffer. Yes, I like the heroes, but the Kanji Klub&nbsp;is pointless, they played a very minor role in a single film. Kylo Ren would have been a much better inclusion and much more appropriate. However, 7965&rsquo;s minifigures&nbsp;blow away 75105&rsquo;s. Nothing against Rey or Finn, but they simply aren&rsquo;t Luke, Leia, or Obiwan. Plus you get Darth Vader which is another huge plus. The only disappointment is the lack of R2-D2&nbsp;and C3PO.</p>

<p>At&nbsp;the end of the day, the minifigures really made a big difference, along with the round radar dish, and it wouldn&rsquo;t take much to improve the details. I chose 7965 and bought the few extra pieces necessary to construct the seats around 75105&rsquo;s chess table as the brown seats that have been around since the 80&rsquo;s just looked bad. The other upgrade I made was that all you have is a bucket to hold the tools, and nowhere for the blasters, light sabers, or crossbow (which&nbsp;Chewie can&rsquo;t even hold in the cockpit). So in the back I placed 2 rows of holders for everything.</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>build</b></p>

<p>The build is pretty cool and varied, plus it taught me a lot about how to build a large, complex design. The base is all technic covered by plates and gives the set tremendous strength. The interior elements are pretty simple, just standard stacking of bricks. Of course I was most interested to see how the curved sides of the ship get built and it is done brilliantly. Yes, it&rsquo;s a little repetitive, but offers enough variation that you can&rsquo;t just assemble them blindly. Once those are assembled it is pretty obvious how the flaps that make the roof will work. They are of course are all identical except for a few decorative bricks on each one, but they are also very simple and can get cranked out very quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cockpit is also an interesting build. The visible part on the outside is just 3 &ldquo;bricks&rdquo; but the interior of it is actually very elaborate, and despite it only being able to hold 2 minifigures with their arms in a certain position, it looks perfect. I&rsquo;m not sure why it needs all the technic parts it uses, as a result they make it a little wobbly, but they&nbsp;do&nbsp;make it fun to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Playability</b></p>

<p>The playability on this set is through the roof. The wide open interior gives you plenty of room to move around (even if you add the droids). The floating ball that Luke trains on with Obiwan&nbsp;is great. You got the chess table which is fun so long as you aren&rsquo;t playing against Chewie. I don&rsquo;t remember ever seeing beds in the movies, but it is logical they would be there. You also have a hidden compartment in the floor that can hide a minifigure, although it can only hold one and is a little difficult to access as it is under an inoperable bridge. You also have the ramp that takes you up onto the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I paid about $85&nbsp;for this used (including the cost of replacing some missing parts) which I feel was a great bargain, especially considering what Lego is asking for the Kessel&nbsp;Run version. The parts aren&rsquo;t too special other than you get a lot of angled plates which are great for spaceships, but that doesn&rsquo;t really matter because you want a Millennium Falcon, not some ship that takes 20 parsecs to make the Kessel Run. The minifigures&nbsp;are exactly the ones you would want in a set like this, although the droids would have been nice to have included. The set is heavy, so flying it is a little difficult, but you can hold it pretty much anywhere and it won&rsquo;t break. If you want to fly spaceships around you should buy the Microfighters&nbsp;which are absolutely perfect for kids to play with, not to mention smash and rebuild. This is definitely very playable, but is more of a set that is fun to build and use as a playset.&nbsp;</p>

"Itellyounothing","2019-08-29T22:17:58.653Z","It's ok I guess","<p>I&#39;ve had this set ages and only bothered to build it once. Lets get into this review and I will explain why.</p>

<p>The Build -&nbsp; I found this repetive, fidly and the structure that resulted was flimsy and displeasing to me. I didn&#39;t want it to be. I wanted it to be cool and fun. But hey there we go.</p>

<p>The Parts - The parts were the best bit about this model. I&#39;ve put them to loads of better uses since.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability - This floppy fracker was no use for swooshing which is just suicide for a Star Wars Falcon set unless it&#39;s gonna just sit on a shelf gathering dust and now they make UCS for that. The turret cannons are rubbish! The minifigs are cool and well equipped. If you are just acting out the Falcon landing somewhere and Han getting in trouble and shooting his way out whilst Luke chops up baddies with his Light sabre, Chewie rips off arms and Leia kisses her own brother&nbsp;then fine. If you want to take off, fly round the room and shoot at stuff, the whole damn thing needs a big structural rebuild. I&#39;ve built star destroyers, allmanner of space stuff and this just seems to need some proper technic skeleton. I would love to see what other designs were tried........&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value for money - Well It&#39;s a licensed set so no not a chance in hell really. I moan, but this is by no means the worst example and does come with many minifigs.</p>

<p>Overall, I probably come across as a bit of a hater. I just found this far to joyless to bother rebuilding and I really don&#39;t want to spend silly money on the UCS set where the same issues are bigger. i.e. unswooshable and lots of boring repetive building methods....</p>

<p>I think old Lego 7190 might turn out to be the best Falcon of them all......&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Make Falcons swooshable again!</p>

<p>The packaging: the package was not too special, a basic 2011 star wars box with a dark blue color and a captain rex helmet on the top.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: the build is a detailed exterior with a few small gaps. The interior has an engine, two beds, a control console, two gunning positions, holochess, and a cockpit.</p>

<p>Parts: no exclusive or new parts are included.</p>

<p>Minifigures: the 6 minifigures included are an exclusive Leia, obi-wan, and Luke. The others are Han solo, Vader, and Chewbacca.</p>

<p>Comparison: this millennium falcon is not as detailed as the UCS, but is still amazing.</p>
