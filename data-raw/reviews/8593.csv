"Thunder_gryphoN","2011-09-18T17:04:15.293Z","Common subject, uncommon style.","<p>Sporting a very nice white color scheme with red and grey trim, this set is a welcome change from the far more common yellow or red of the Technic line. Additionally, with its long-nose truck cab and tall, narrow, and thin wheels, this set has a much different look and feel than most other Technic trucks that are mostly based on the blunt-nose cab-over configuration.<br><br>The A-model assembly requires some patience with getting things aligned and centered properly, but it did not have any overly tricky or confusing parts. The knobs for deploying the outriggers are a bit awkward to turn, as they are obstructed by the bucket when lowered, but they are functional and lift the truck up slightly to stabilize it. The boom only has a single range of motion possible for lifting, but it reaches quite high and the coaxial routing for controlling the raising and lowering of the boom allows it to rotate on the turntable base freely. The steering mechanism is effective and has no slop. The weakest point in the design of this model is the bucket, as it doesn't capture the look of an actual bucket or platform very well.<br><br>I found the B-model's functions very interesting in their design with how they use locking toggles instead of gears. The four-wheel steering mechanism is also noteworthy. There are enough parts left over to make two pallets, a definite plus to playability even though the lifting capacity of the model is low.<br><br>Apart from the turntable, the set doesn't have any particularly special pieces and the parts count is somewhat padded by the large number of small pins and connectors. Also included is a hefty amount of stickers. While they look good on the A-model, they may frustrate those who don't have patience and a steady hand. Instruction booklets for both the A and B model are included with the set.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Attractive color scheme and visual design.</li><li>B-model functionality.</li><li>Functional outriggers.<br></li><li>Instructions for both A and B models included in the box.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Limited range of motion on bucket truck boom.</li><li>Bucket design isn't very good.</li><li>Awkward location of outrigger knobs.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, set 8071 is solidly designed and both the A and B model are fun to play with and fairly simple to assemble. The atypical style is well-done and will stand out among the many cherry pickers, trucks, and telehandlers that Lego has released in the past few years.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,3

Maybe the problem is in the box, without the bold red or yellow it just doesn't stand out from the background. <br><br></p>Look at videos here: <a href=""http://www.technic-sets.com/lego-technic-8071-bucket-truck-telehandler-nice-medium-set-year-2011/"">LEGO Technic 8071</a>, they even have a C-Model (!?)<br><br><p>I like it very much, the long nose,&nbsp; and the B model is cool too, especially the 4 wheel steering.&nbsp;</p>I just wish it had a few more ""special"" parts.<br><a href=""http://www.technic-sets.com/lego-technic-8071-bucket-truck-telehandler-nice-medium-set-year-2011/""></a><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"aldredd","2014-06-30T15:23:28.467Z","A fun middle-sized set to build.","<p>I can&#39;t say this was a set i pined after, but I always loved the 8292 Cherry Picker, and this was a used set at a very good price, so snapped it up.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are all pretty standard. You don&#39;t see many white technic sets, other than the odd small quad-bike, so it&#39;s a great change to the usual yellows &amp; blacks.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is enjoyable, and took me an evening to put together. It&#39;s built in a slightly different order than I&#39;m used to, with the cabin actually being finished quite early on in the build. There is also a bit more &#39;functionlity&#39; than is first apparent - the out-riggers lower from knobs behind the bucket arm, it steers from the rear knob, and knobs on the sides raise &amp; lower the bucket &amp; turn the turntable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I love the size &amp; look of this model - it scales really well. It moves away from the typical European look &amp; feel of a truck which is a nice change also (don&#39;t get me wrong - love the European style trucks!). There is a lot of detail in the truck for a model this size. Where I feel it lets itself down a little is the lift-arm - whilst it functions well, it just looks a little skimpy with this lone beam supporting the bucket. Would have been nice to see this bulked out a little. Only other area I would have like to see different would be to have the outriggers controlled from a single knob, rather than two - but this is minor, really.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A fun set you can sit and build in an evening - or two if you like a slower pace. Great to see a set that stands out a little from the rows of yellow trucks too!</p>
