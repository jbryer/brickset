"pyry","2011-06-12T14:56:42.797Z","Technic SUV with no big surprises","<p>I was really interested in this set since I saw the first picture. An SUV is a vehicle you see quite often and I think the look and feel is really good for such a familiar object.</p><p>Building experience was somewhat ruined due to a missing liftarm (32009). Instead, the sealed box contained an extra liftarm (6629) that shouldn't be included in this model. This is the first time ever I'm missing a piece from a Lego set so I thought this had to happen eventually.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Good looks</li><li>Really nice size (allows some detailing, e.g. engine, but not too big for playability)</li><li>Functional hood, hatch and doors&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Really bad suspension (only one shock absorber in front, rear wheels have a weird bogie)</li><li>Headlamps not directed forwards (minor but annoying detail)</li><li>V-4 in an SUV? You must be kidding...</li><li>Lots of stickers (if you dont like them)</li></ul>
<p>In conclusion Extreme Cruiser is a reasonably priced model and while the suspension is bad this set will deliver for all your cruising needs.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,5,4

"aldredd","2014-07-16T15:18:05.403Z","Great mid-sized set","<p>I&#39;m generally not too bothered about technic &#39;cars&#39;, but grabbed this one on eBay marked as &#39;used&#39;, but they&#39;d only really opened the box, so had the &#39;build from new&#39; experience.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging for this set identifies it as being &#39;Limited Edition&#39;. I&#39;m still unsure what makes it limited edition other than availability - but seems to be fairly readily available online so still not entirely sure.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>the part list is fairly standard - lots of black panels (more panels that you&#39;d perhaps usually&nbsp;see on a set this size) and several &#39;box-beams&#39; (eg pt. 64179) for rigidity, and again parts you&nbsp;may not normally see on a set this size.?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was enjoyable - right size to comfortably complete in an evening. Not terribly challenging of course. I was overall pretty impressed by the level of complexity incorporated into this build. Usually, these types of vehicles are much larger (41999,9398,8297) at there is just so much detail in the chassis and suspension systems. So actually, they&#39;ve done a sterling&nbsp;job scaling everything into a much smaller footprint. Of course, there have to be compromises. The rear axle sit on a bogy &#39;suspended&#39; by two shocks, and the front axle has a single shock utilised by both front wheels. Not an ideal setup, but a clever one for the space available. The effect works well, save for the fact that it means the rear is much firmer than the front (nothing wrong with a firm rear though, I might add!)</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A good looking model overall, and a size mid-sized build. As I said, I&#39;m not a big &#39;cars&#39; fan so it&#39;s not one I&#39;m going to marvel at, but did enjoy building it, and a good addition to the collection</p>
