"legojoe","2011-08-02T05:17:45.197Z","A nice big truck with a large functional flatbed for transporting other vehicles","<p><span class=""currency_converter_text"">I found this set surprisingly cheap (</span><span title=""Convert this amount"" class=""currency_converter_link""><span title=""Convert this amount"" class=""currency_converter_link"">79</span></span><span class=""currency_converter_text""> â‚¬) for a new set at a local store and decided to buy it. The set has a hefty amount of parts and the assembly was very nice because it is built in a modular way. For example, the motor section with all the gears is one section, while the cabin is another one. All the sections are built pretty far on their own before assembling together. I do not particularly like the big panel parts on these new legos and this model has quite a few of them. I like it more when models are built from small parts. The yellow/red colour combination can be quite striking but it does not bother me personally.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p><span class=""currency_converter_text"">When assembled, I tried raising the flatbed and retracting it back while another model was on it (</span><span title=""Convert this amount"" class=""currency_converter_link""><span title=""Convert this amount"" class=""currency_converter_link"">8052</span></span><span class=""currency_converter_text""> B) and it worked nicely. It can hold quite a lot of weight. The cable and hook that on the bed can be used to tow in a vehicle and also secure one during transport. The fork however, although it is technically very nice and innovative, can't hold much weight. </span><span title=""Convert this amount"" class=""currency_converter_link""><span title=""Convert this amount"" class=""currency_converter_link"">8052</span></span><span class=""currency_converter_text""> B was way too heavy for it. I suppose it could lift something very light. The fork is more cosmetic than functional.</span> Another negative side is the structure at the other end of the bed where the winch is located. It has too little support and it wobbles a lot when the winch is handled.<br></p><p></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-Very big model (long)<br></li><li>-The flatbed (as wide as the truck and starts right after the cabin) can carry another quite big model on it.<br></li><li>-The flatbed mechanism is nice and quite sturdy. It can handle a decent amount of weight.</li><li>-Innovative fork mechanism with a double action feature.</li><li>-Clutch gears.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The fork mechanism is weak. It can only tow something light.<br></li><li>-The set has quite many panel parts that I personally don't like too much.</li><li>-The part of the flatbed where the winch is located is rather flimsy.</li></ul>
<p>As a conclusion, I like this model a lot. It is very long and the bed is wide and long as well. It can transport a big model on it and the bed mechanism is sturdy as said before. I have yet to build the B model, which didn't seem as impressive in the pictures.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,4,3,4
"Tazio","2011-09-02T18:43:25.54Z","Not a must","This is the fourth model I put together. I had a lot of fun doing so BUT...may things missing for the size of it. Just to point out a few :<div><br></div><div><ul><li>Missing engine. Really? no engine on a truck this size?</li><li>The chasis is just plain WEAK, no torsion rigidity whatsoever.</li><li>Poor fork strengh, yes...it's nice to look at but it just does not work at all, perhaps with a custom built light car.</li><li>A Technic model with PFs and a hook, but the PFs don't make the hook work...really?there could be a mod just below the batery box and out of the gearbox, that would be awesome and might encourage you to overlook other things.</li><li>Removing the batery pack is a rather complex task.</li></ul><div><br></div></div><div>These things make the model...almost a parts model I believe, or a nicely shaped paper weight.</div><div><br></div><div>Now to its favor the model was indeed fun to work with as usual, so no complaints in that matter, a rather easy model to work on. Also, it looks NICE; I have to reckon that I bought it for the looks, and that exactly what I got, just looks.</div><div><br></div><div>If you like the way it looks, can pass on the functionality of it and find it on a good deal, then buy it, worse case you some PFs and new gears to work with.</div><div><br></div><div>Cheers.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"SoxRockPatsRule","2012-04-26T23:41:46.133Z","BEST Technic Set To Date... BAR NONE!","<p>AWESOME set!! - as a former towtruck driver, i would have liked to have seen a pair of tie down straps, a jack, and an opening driver side box to put them in, and some side rails on the bed, but other than that, an absolutely AWESOME SET / BUILD... VERY fun, and VERY MUCH worth the $100 price tag... (so much so, it's almost worth puting an unopened one away for future sale at a HANDSOME proffit!!)</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 - FUN build</li><li>Pro 2 - LOTS of parts</li><li>Pro 3 - COOL color scheme</li><li>Pro 4 - EXCELLENT value for the money</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 - no tie down straps</li><li>Con 2 - no jack</li><li>Con 3 - driver's side tool box doesn't open &amp; store ""extras""</li><li>Con 4 - no side rails on the bed</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>in conclusion, i HIGHLY recommend this set... i actually recommend buying TWO of these sets and putting one away for for future sale... i GUARANTEE it will wind up paying for BOTH sets down the road!!.... GUARANTEED!!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

 because I think every model is as it should be and the beauty of LEGO 
is that if you don't like it you can always do it your way.<br><br>But I have a grievance in regards to LEGO cost cutting and quality department:<br>- yellow bits all have different shade of faded yellow, different size have different shades, this looks like patchwork up close<br>- the stickers' yellow does not match the brick color in any way, forget about the looks you get on the box,<br>
-
 cabin panels, 2 panels for top front roof slope - made out of different
 kind of soft plastic! you touch it - you scratch it kind of thing, 
VERY CHEAP...of course in different shade of yellow, simply pathetic 
cost cutting,<br>
- tires in my model are very soft, model is heavy on 
front and tires can come off the rim easily, this softness also causes 
front to low down - not fun on a thicker carpet. <br>
<br>
I really truly 
recommend it, The construction is simply brilliant, a lot of brain 
behind it. It looks so good that you can put it into a glass cabinet 
with soft light and have people marvel over. <br>
<br>
I LOVE IT!<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

It may only have two motorized functions but these are really cool and ingenious:</div><div>- the fork not only shifts out but also automatically unfolds</div><div>- the bed tilts, but also the position of the wheels turn.</div><div><br></div><div>I was so stupid to sell this set but rebought it...</div><div>The cabin is also very cool, using a lot of plates, tiles and wedged plates...</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
"kaans","2013-08-16T21:35:49.793Z","hate the colors","I wasn't expecting much from this set, however right after opening the box, I was really excited, and the set impressed, the truck is really sturdy, really fun to operate<br><br>The only thing I don't like is the colors, yellow and red are too flashy<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
